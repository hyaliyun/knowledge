She was built by Vickers Armstrong, Barrow, and launched on 25 March 1944. So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy (RN) to bear the name Trump. She spent the majority of her life attached to the 4th Submarine division based in Australia. She was kept in service following the war and was refitted for greater underwater performance, and was the final RN submarine to be posted in Australia, departing in January 1969. She was sold off and broken up for scrap in August 1971. Design and description HMS Trump was one of the group three of T-class submarines.Akermann (2002): p. 386 She was part of the second batch of the third group to be ordered, in 1941.McCarthy (2006): p. 12 She was one of a number of boats which had an all- welded hull which increased diving depth to , an increase of .McCarthy (2006): p. 13 The torpedo armament was the same as the earlier group two, although by the time group three was coming into service it was realised that external torpedo tubes had major problems and affected the streamlining of the boats; the external tubes were abandoned in the following . Due to expected use in tropical climates, boats of group three were equipped with freon blowers in order to deal with the increased temperatures. Service World War II Trump was commissioned in July 1944. After trials and a work-up in the North Sea in mid-October she was sent to Perth in Western Australia. On arrival, she joined the 4th Submarine division, supported by the depot ship . From Perth, Trump carried out four patrols before the end of the war. During her Far East service, Trump sank the Japanese guardboat No. 15 Shosei Maru on 13 May; a Japanese sailing vessel on 24 May; and two coasters, one on 29 May and the other on 1 June. She sank a tanker on 5 June and together with her sister boat , she sank a Japanese cargo vessel on 9 August. Also with Tiptoe, Trump carried out an attack on a convoy on 3 August. Although it was escorted by a Japanese patrol boat, they successfully sank Tencho Maru, an army cargo ship, with the sinking credited to Tiptoe. Post war Trump survived the war and continued in service with the Royal Navy. Trump was one of several all-welded T-class submarines rebuilt for greater underwater performance.Akermann (2002): p. 383 This \\"Slippery T\\" or \\"Super T\\" conversion involved the removal of the deck gun and the replacement of the conning tower with a streamlined \\"fin\\". Extra batteries were installed below the control room and additional electric motors were accommodated by cutting through the pressure hull and adding in a new hull section inserted aft of the control room. The diesel engines were modified and supercharged with output increased by . The gun armaments and external torpedo tubes were removed, and the bow reshaped. Trump was one of two submarines, the other being , which had the bridge incorporated into the added fin section; and was the last to undergo this conversion. In 1960, Trump, along with and Tabard, rejoined the 4th Submarine Flotilla at Sydney, Australia. There, they operated with units of the Far East Fleet, the Royal Australian Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Navy. In June 1964, she participated in the \\"NEWS EX\\" anti-submarine exercise in the Hauraki Gulf off the coast of New Zealand. Trump underwent refits at Cockatoo Dockyard, between January 1962 and April 1963, and again between August 1965 and October 1966. She was the final Royal Navy submarine to be on station in Australia, departing on 10 January 1969 when the 1st Australian Submarine squadron was formed from the RN 4th Submarine Squadron. She was temporarily assigned to the Royal Australian Navy while boats of the were under construction, but remained a Royal Navy submarine. Trump was scrapped at Newport from 1 August 1971.

He became famous in 1966 for playing Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof, which role he performed some 1100 times in the Netherlands and in London. He played many characters on Dutch television, among others in the popular youth series Q en Q (1974) and Thomas en Senior (1985‚Äì88). From 1984 to 1999 he played Grandpa Lex on Sesamstraat, the Dutch version of Sesame Street. Goudsmit was one of the artists who recorded the song Shalom from Holland (written by Simon Hammelburg and Ron Klipstein) as a token of solidarity to the Israeli people, threatened by missiles from Iraq, during the first Gulf War in 1991. When Goudsmit died as the consequences of a stroke, instead of doing an episode dealing with his death, along the lines of Mr. Hooper's death, the producers addressed the issue on the program following Sesamstraat, called Jeugdjournaal (Youth News). The program aired a compilation of his best appearances on the show and commented on his death. Goudsmit had told producers that he wanted to stay on Sesamstraat even after his death, so the latest scenes he taped were still used on the next season. During this season, he was slowly phased out of the show.

He graduated Wellesley High School in Massachusetts in 1972 and attended Pomona College in Claremont, California. He earned a Ph.D. in English from Princeton University in 1983. His 1992 New Yorker article \\"Crisis in the Hot Zone\\" was expanded into his breakout book, The Hot Zone (1994). It is classified as a \\"non-fiction thriller\\" about ebolaviruses. He came to know about ebola through such contacts as U.S. Army researchers Drs. C.J. Peters and Nancy Jaax. His fascination began during a visit to Africa where he was an eyewitness to epidemics. The book served as the (very loose) basis of the Hollywood movie Outbreak (1995) about military machinations surrounding a fictional \\"Motaba virus\\". Preston's novel The Cobra Event (1998), about a terrorism release of a fictional virus combining various qualities of different diseases upon New York City, alarmed even then-President Bill Clinton who, shortly after reading it, instigated a review of bio-terror threats to the U.S. The book strove to tell a fast-paced thriller narrative within the bounds of well-researched bio-terrorism possibility, and was reportedly pressed upon Clinton by a molecular biologist when he was attending a Renaissance Weekend event.Review of Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War, by Judith Miller, et al., in Washington Monthly, 2001 The Demon in the Freezer (2002) covers the story of the eradication of smallpox, perhaps the most destructive virus to have plagued mankind.

Biography Early political activity (until 1897) Labriola was born in Naples on 21 January 1873 to Luigi Labriola, an artisan. While studying jurisprudence in University of Naples, Arturo Labriola started his political activity. In 1891 he joined the Republican-Socialist University Circle. Between 1892‚Äì1895, he collaborated on various periodicals: Socialismo Popolare, edited by Carlo Monicelli, Rivista Popolare di Politica, Litteratura e Scienze Sociali, edited by Napoleone Colajanni and Critica Sociale, edited by Filippo Turati. In 1894‚Äì1895, Labriola was involved with the Fasci Siciliani and therefore was suspended for one year from university studies. In 1897, Labriola joined Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and fought in the Greco- Turkish War in Crete. Life in exile (1898‚Äì1900) In May 1898, workers in Milan organized strikes and protests to demonstrate against the government. The riots were brutally repressed: troops fired on demonstrators, and Filippo Turati was arrested, accused of inspiring the riots. Labriola fled to Geneva in order to elude arrest. There, he taught at University of Geneva and worked with Vilfredo Pareto. Labriola was expelled from Switzerland in the same year and moved to Paris. In Paris he met the socialists Georges Sorel, Hubert Lagardelle and Paul Lafargue. Revolutionary syndicalist period He returned to Italy in 1900, and in 1902 published a weekly called Avanguardia Socialista which became the center of activity for Italian revolutionary syndicalism. He nonetheless withdrew his support for revolution, and adopted Marxist Reformism, becoming a member of the Italian Parliament as an independent. Favourable to Italy's participation in World War I, Labriola also served as Minister of Labor in the last of Giovanni Giolitti's cabinets (1920). An opponent of Fascism, he had to take exile in France after Benito Mussolini came to power, but returned in 1935. In 1946 he was elected member of the Constituent Assembly of Italy as a National Democratic Union candidate. In 1948 he became a senator of the new Republic. As it was confirmed by the former President of the Grand Orient of Italy, he was one of the eight father constituents belonging to the main Italian Masonic organization.

It originated as the main popular music label operated by the Am-Par Record Corporation. Am-Par also created the Impulse! jazz label in 1960. It acquired many labels before ABC was sold to MCA Records in 1979. ABC produced music in a variety of genres: pop, rock, jazz, country, rhythm and blues, soundtrack, gospel, and polka. In addition to producing records, ABC licensed masters from independent record producers, and purchased regionally released records for national distribution. The label was initially called Am-Par Records (1955), but quickly changed to ABC-Paramount Records (1955‚Äì1966), and then renamed ABC Records in 1966. Background American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres (AB- PT) was the owner of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). It evolved from federal antitrust actions taken against the movie studios and broadcasting companies in the 1940s and early 1950s. In 1943 the Federal Communications Commission took action against anti-competitive practices, one of which forced the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) to sell the Blue Network, the sister network of NBC Red Network. Blue was purchased by the businessman Edward J. Noble, and he changed its name to the American Broadcasting Company in 1946. In 1953 ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres, the divested former exhibition/cinema division of Paramount Pictures. The newly merged corporation was chaired by former Paramount Theaters executive Leonard Goldenson and was originally headquartered at 1501 Broadway in New York City, above the Paramount Theater in Times Square. History  ABC-Paramount Records  ABC Paramount 78rpm record and original sleeve American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres formed a records division in 1955 with Samuel H. Clark as its first president. The division was incorporated on as Am-Par Record Corporation. By August 1955, the unit was organized with AMPCO (ASCAP) and PAMCO (BMI) as subsidiary publishing units. The record label began as Am-Par, but no records were released until it was changed to ABC-Paramount in September 1955. Eydie Gorme was the company's first signed artist. The company recorded its first single record, \\"Sincerely Yours\\" and \\"Come Home\\", both by Gorme. Alec Templeton's \\"Smart Alec\\" was the company's first LP recorded, also in September 1955. One of Gorme's singles was its first release in January 1956. \\"Chain Gang\\" by Bobby Scott in February 1956 was the company's first national hit. George Hamilton IV's \\"A Rose and a Baby Ruth\\" single was Am-Paramount's first million-selling single in October 1956. In 1957, the company had two million-selling single in June with \\"Diana\\" by Paul Anka and in October with \\"At the Hop\\" by Danny & the Juniors. Am-Paramount Records in May 1958 debut the Apt subsidiary label with its first million-selling single, \\"Little Star\\" by the Elegants, released the same month. Chancellor Records had Am-Par Record Corporation handle its distribution starting in 1957 and started a trend. Chancellor had its first million-selling single in October 1958 with Lloyd Price's \\"Stagger Lee\\". Am-Par purchased Grand Award Records including the newly formed Command Records label, in 1959. The company started a second label for jazz, Impulse! Records, in November 1960. Impulse released its first four records were released in January 1961. The company had artists that earned three Grammy Awards in 1960. While in January 1961, the company purchased Westminster Records, a classical label. Thus Am-Par Record had a label for each music genre. Am-Par Record Corporation was renamed to ABC- Paramount Records, Inc. on December 7, 1961. The company opened a Los Angeles office in January 1962. Ray Charles formed Tangerine Records in March 1962 and arranged for ABC-Paramount to distribute Tangerine's records. The company formed Jet Record Distributors based in Long Island City, N.Y. as its local distributor. Also in 1962, the company had acquired Music Guild label and library for Westminster Records. In 1965, Clark was promoted to vice-president in charge of AB-PT's non-broadcast operations. National sales manager Larry Newton was named ABC-Paramount president. On January 4, 1965, vice-president in charge of sales Larry Newton was promoted to president of ABC-Paramount Records. The previous president, Sam Clark was promoted to director of theater operations for American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres. Newton's first action as president was to restart Apt Records as a teen-oriented West Coast base label under Irwin Garr. ABC Records The label was renamed ABC Records in June 1966. New Deal Record Service Corp., a rack-jobbing and record distribution company, along with its affiliates were also purchased by the company. In 1967, Dunhill Records was purchased from Lou Adler. In 1970, ABC and Dunhill moved its headquarters to Los Angeles. Newton was promoted to vice-president in charge of ABC Pictures. Dunhill co-owner Jay Lasker was named president and referred to the combined operations as ABC/Dunhill. At that time ABC had another five labels: Westminster, Command, Probe, Impulse, and Bluesway. At the August 29, 1970 Directors Guild meeting, ABC/Dunhill launched a number of marketing initiatives. The company planned to have writers create a broader music for the catalog market. Imprints Probe and Apt were relaunched, Probe as an label which held the international rights to ABC's albums and Apt as a label which released budget cassettes and 8-track tapes. Jazz dropped from Impulse's cover for a new slogan: \\"University Series of Fine Recording\\" and two new series were launched: Audio Treasury and Westminster Gold for classic and youth fare respectively. By May 1972, ABC formed the ABC Leisure Group, which included ABC Records, Anchor Records, and ABC Records and Tape Sales, plus a new retail record-store division. Lasker left ABC to join Ariola America Records in 1975. He was succeeded by Jerry Rubinstein, who served as company head until 1977. In November 1972, ABC bought country music company Cartwheel Records. In 1974, ABC switched British distribution from EMI to the EMI-distributed Anchor Records, allowing ABC recordings to be issued on the ABC label in the UK, and Anchor records to be distributed by ABC on the Anchor label in the US. Also in 1974, ABC acquired Famous Music Records Group including Nashville based Dot Records then began releasing ABC country music under the ABC/Dot label until January 1979. As a cost-cutting measure, ABC Records discarded many master tapes in the 1970s to save storage space. When these recordings were reissued on compact disc in the 1980s, CD versions were often taken from master copies which had less than optimal sound quality. The company's last president, Steve Diener, was named president in 1977 after serving as head of ABC Records' international division. Because of financial problems except for its Nashville office, ABC Records was sold on January 31, 1979 to MCA Records with ABC Records being its third label likely under a different name. Instead, MCA discontinued ABC Records on March 5, 1979 and albums in the ABC catalog still selling well were reissued on MCA. Diener died in April 2019, aged 80. Acquisitions ABC Records sub-labeled Apt to release singles. In the early 1960s, it bought Westminster, a classical music label. For jazz it created Impulse!. Led by Creed Taylor and Bob Thiele, Impulse! developed a reputation for innovative releases, including albums by John Coltrane from 1961 until his death in 1967. ABC created Bluesway for blues music. Tangerine was formed by Ray Charles to produce his albums and those he produced. ABC Records bought Dunhill in the summer of 1967, forming ABC Dunhill Records. It also bought Don Robey's record labels, including Duke, Peacock, Back Beat, and Song Bird on May 23, 1973. In 1974 ABC bought the Famous Music record labels from Gulf and Western, the parent company of Paramount. This acquisition gave ABC Dot, Blue Thumb, and a distribution deal with Sire, which released the first album from the Ramones. ABC purchased all labels from Enoch Light in October 1959. It acquired Audition, Command, Colortone, and Waldorf Music Hall. In 1979, ABC was acquired by MCA for $30 million. It operated briefly as a separate division. MCA was absorbed by the Universal Music Group, which currently distributes recordings for ABC's current sister company, Disney Music Group, worldwide except for Russia. This is not the same ABC Records that operates in Australia, which is run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, although the Ampar label was distributed in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s, first by W&G; Records (1955‚Äì60) and then by Festival. Nor is it the sub-label of Voiceprint.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, these would be the members of his jazz combo, whose lineup would often change, sometimes including bassists Cacha√≠to and later Carlos del Puerto, and drummers Guillermo Barreto and later Enrique Pl√°.Dalmace, Patrick.

This all-star big band would back singers such as Elena Burke and Omara Portuondo.Orquesta Cubana de M√∫sica Moderna: Discography, Paquito's Records. In 1973, Chucho along with other members of the Orquesta Cubana de M√∫sica Moderna founded Irakere, an ensemble that bridged songo and Afro-Cuban jazz. He would simultaneously continue his solo career, eventually signing with Blue Note Records, which allowed him to get international exposure. As a result, Chucho's work has received universal critical acclaim from the media, winning five Grammy awards. Chucho's father, Bebo, who attained a legendary status as the pianist and director the Tropicana Club orchestra and Orquesta Sabor de Cuba, fled Cuba in 1960, and did not record music again until the 1990s. In the late 1990s, Chucho decided to focus on his solo career, and his son Chuchito replaced him as the pianist/director of Irakere. Chucho and Bebo occasionally played together until the latter's death in 2013. Since 2010, Chucho performs with a backing band known as the Afro-Cuban Messengers. Chucho has spent much of his time teaching younger generations, either in his homeland of Cuba at the Havana National school (with many famous musicians such as Herbie Hancock), or elsewhere.  Awards and honors  Chucho has won four Grammy Awards as a solo artist: * Best Latin Jazz Album in 2001 for his album Live at the Village Vanguard * Best Latin Jazz Album in 2010 for Juntos Para Siempre, with his father Bebo Vald√©s * Best Latin Jazz Album in 2011 for Chucho's Steps, with the Afro-Cuban Messengers * Best Latin Jazz Album in 2017 for Tribute to Irakere: Live in Marciac.Robinson, Circles. \\"Cuba's Chucho Vald√©s Wins 5th Grammy\\", Havana Times, February 14, 2011.

The Seasons (German: Die Jahreszeiten), Hob. XXI:3) is a secular oratorio by Joseph Haydn, first performed in 1801. History Haydn was led to write The Seasons by the great success of his previous oratorio The Creation (1798), which had become very popular and was in the course of being performed all over Europe. Libretto The libretto for The Seasons was prepared for Haydn, just as with The Creation, by Baron Gottfried van Swieten, an Austrian nobleman who had also exercised an important influence on the career of Mozart (among other things commissioning Mozart's reorchestration of Handel's Messiah).Richard Drakeford, notes to Philips recording 464 035-2 (1999). Van Swieten's libretto was based on extracts from the long English poem \\"The Seasons\\" by James Thomson (1700‚Äì1748), which had been published in 1730. Whereas in The Creation Swieten was able to limit himself to rendering an existing (anonymous) libretto into German, for The Seasons he had a much more demanding task. Olleson writes, \\"Even when Thomson's images were retained, they required abbreviation and adaptation to such an extent that usually no more than faint echoes of them can be discerned, and the libretto often loses all touch with the poem which was its starting point. Increasingly during the course of the oratorio, the words are essentially van Swieten's own or even imported from foreign sources.\\"Olleson (2009:357) Like The Creation, The Seasons was intended as a bilingual work. Since Haydn was very popular in England (particularly following his visits there in 1791‚Äì1792 and 1794‚Äì1795), he wished the work to be performable in English as well as German. Van Swieten therefore made a translation of his libretto back into English, fitting it to the rhythm of the music. Olleson notes that it is \\"fairly rare\\" that the translated version actually matches the Thomson original.Olleson (2009:357) Van Swieten's command of English was not perfect, and the English text he created has not always proven satisfying to listeners; for example, one critic writes, \\"Clinging to [the] retranslation, however, is the heavy-handed imagery of Haydn's sincere, if officious, patron. Gone is the bloom of Thomson's original.\\"Bernard Holland, writing in the New York Times, January 23, 1988. Olleson calls the English text \\"often grotesque\\", and suggests that English- speaking choruses should perform the work in German: \\"The Seasons is better served by the decent obscurity of a foreign language than by the English of the first version.\\"Olleson (2009:357) Van Swieten's words also show some inconsistency in tone, ranging from the rustically humorous (for instance, a movement depicting a wily peasant girl playing a trick on her rich suitor) to the uplifting (as in several large-scale choruses praising God for the beauty of nature).Drakeford (1999). Composition, premiere, and publication The composition process was arduous for Haydn, in part because his health was gradually failing and partly because Haydn found van Swieten's libretto to be rather taxing. Haydn took two years to complete the work. Like The Creation, The Seasons had a dual premiere, first for the aristocracy whose members had financed the work (Schwarzenberg palace, Vienna, 24 April 1801), then for the public (Redoutensaal, Vienna, 19 May).Clark (2005:xvi) The oratorio was considered a clear success, but not a success comparable to that of The Creation. In the years that followed, Haydn continued to lead oratorio performances for charitable causes, but it was usually The Creation that he led, not The Seasons. The aging Haydn lacked the energy needed to repeat the labor of self-publication that he had undertaken for The Creation and instead assigned the new oratorio to his regular publisher at that time, Breitkopf & H√§rtel, who published it in 1802.Jones (2009:25) Forces The Seasons is written for a fairly large late-Classical orchestra, a chorus singing mostly in four parts, and three vocal soloists, representing archetypal country folk: Simon (bass), Lucas (tenor), and Hanne (soprano). The solo voices are thus the same three as in The Creation. The orchestral parts are for 2 flutes (1st doubling on piccolo in one aria), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons and contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 1 alto trombone, 1 tenor trombone and 1 bass trombone, timpani, percussion, and strings. However, some of the key early performances at the Tonk√ºnstler Society in Vienna were for much larger forces (as was the fashion at the time); Haydn led performances for both large and small ensembles. Material surviving from these large-scale Viennese performances indicates the use of tripled wind (arranged into three separate groups, each one similar to the Harmonie wind ensembles of the time), doubled brass and as many as ten horn players, backed up by at least eighty string players and similar numbers of singers.Paul McCreesh, in notes to Signum Records CD SIGCD480, Haydn: The Seasons (2017). In addition, a fortepiano usually plays in secco recitatives, with or without other instruments from the orchestra. Musical content The oratorio is divided into four parts, corresponding to Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, with the usual recitatives, arias, choruses, and ensemble numbers. Among the more rousing choruses are a hunting song with horn calls, a wine celebration with dancing peasantsThis chorus (\\"Juhe, der Wein ist da\\", \\"Huzzah, the wine is there\\") contains the so-called \\"drunk fugue\\", described by Humphreys as \\"a riotous fugal chorus in which the voices drop the subject halfway through the entries (as in a drunken stupor) while the accompanying instruments are left to complete it.\\" (Humphreys 2009: 111) (foreshadowing the third movement of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony), a loud thunderstorm (ditto for Beethoven's fourth movement), and an absurdly stirring ode to toil: :The huts that shelter us, :The wool that covers us, :The food that nourishes us, :All is thy grant, thy gift, :O noble toil. Haydn remarked that while he had been industrious his whole life, this was the first occasion he had ever been asked to write a chorus in praise of industry. Some especially lyrical passages are the choral prayer for a bountiful harvest, \\"Sei nun gn√§dig, milder Himmel\\" (Be thou gracious, O kind heaven), the gentle nightfall that follows the storm, and Hanne's cavatina on Winter. The work is filled with the \\"tone-painting\\" that also characterized The Creation: a plowman whistles as he works (in fact, he whistles the well-known theme from Haydn's own Surprise Symphony), a bird shot by a hunter falls from the sky, there is a sunrise (evoking the one in The Creation), and so on. The \\"French trash\\" episode There is some evidence that Haydn himself was not happy with van Swieten's libretto, or at least one particular aspect of tone-painting it required, namely the portrayal of the croaking of frogs, which is found during the serene movement that concludes Part II, \\"Summer\\". The version of the anecdote given below is from the work of Haydn scholar H. C. Robbins Landon. In 1801, August Eberhard M√ºller (1767‚Äì1817) prepared a piano version of the oratorio's orchestra part, for purposes of rehearsal and informal performance. Haydn, whose health was in decline, did not take on this task himself, but he did look over a draft of M√ºller's work and wrote some suggested changes in the margins. Amid these changes appeared an off-the-cuff complaint about van Swieten's libretto: :NB! This whole passage, with its imitation of the frogs, was not my idea: I was forced to write this Frenchified trash. This wretched idea disappears rather soon when the whole orchestra is playing, but it simply cannot be included in the pianoforte reduction.Cited from Robbins Landon (1959, 197) Robbins Landon continues the story as follows: : M√ºller foolishly showed the passage in the enclosed sheet, quoted above, to the editor of the Zeitung f√ºr die elegante Welt,German: \\"Journal for the elegant world\\" who promptly included it in support of his criticism of Swieten's wretchedIt is not clear whether this is Robbins Landon's opinion or the journal editor's. libretto. Swieten was enraged, and [Haydn's friend] Griesinger reported that His Excellency \\"intends to rub into Haydn's skin, with salt and pepper, the assertion that he [Haydn] was forced into composing the croaking frogs.\\"Robbins Landon (1959, 197) A later letter of Griesinger's indicates that the rift thus created was not permanent. The term \\"Frenchified trash\\" was almost certainly not a gesture of contempt for France or French people; Haydn in fact had friendly relationships with French musicians (see, e.g. Paris symphonies). Rather, Haydn was probably referring to an earlier attempt by van Swieten to persuade him to set the croaking of the frogs by showing him a work by the French composer Andr√© Gr√©try that likewise included frog-croaking.Dies (1810, 187) Critical reception Although the work has always attracted far less attention than The Creation, it nonetheless has been strongly appreciated by critics. Charles Rosen calls both oratorios \\"among the greatest works of the century\\", but judges The Seasons to be the musically more successful of the two.Rosen (1971, 370) Daniel Heartz, writing near the end of a massive three-volume account of the Classical era, writes \\"The Hunting and Drinking choruses first led me to study Haydn's music more extensively beginning some forty years ago ... no music has elated me more in old age than The Seasons.\\"Heartz (2009:644 fn.) Michael Steinberg writes that the work \\"ensure[s] Haydn's premiere place with Titian, Michelangelo and Turner, Mann and Goethe, Verdi and Stravinsky, as one of the rare artists to whom old age brings the gift of ever bolder invention.\\"Steinberg's words appeared originally in program notes; they are quoted here from Heartz (2009:644) Opinions vary as to the nature of the relationship between The Creation and The Seasons ‚Äì whether they are two separate works or an enormous religious diptych. Van Swieten, at any rate, was certainly keen to follow up on the former's success with another large-scale pictorial work in a similar vein,Karl Schumann, notes to Philips recording 464 034-2 (1999). and some authors have seen the two oratorios as constituting the first and second act of a metaphorical 'vast sacred opera'.Marc Vignal, notes to Philips recording 464 034-2 (1999).

The tall mountain sits on the southern shore of Lysefjorden, just southwest of the village of Lysebotn. Its northern side is a massive cliff, plunging almost straight down to fjord, a sight which attracts many visitors each year. Another tourist attraction, the Kjeragbolten, a stone wedged between two rocks is located on the mountain. The Kjeragfossen waterfall plunges off the mountain down to the fjord. It is one of the tallest waterfalls in the world. Kjerag is a popular hiking destination. Some go there because Preikestolen has become too crowded, some to jump onto Kjeragbolten and some BASE jumpers from all over the world go there to jump off the high cliffs. Kjerag is also a popular climbing destination, with many difficult routes going up its steep faces.It is widely reported that Peter Whittaker(20 hour roped-solo of Freerider on El Capitan) has done a free solo of the 800 meter Renshaw-Foulkes in around 2 hours in late August 2020 after it had dried out. See climber.com, plantetgimper.com, etc. for details on the 20 pitch solo. The easiest ascent starts from the visitors center √òygardsst√∏len, with a 2.5-3-hour walk each way. From Stavanger, it is roughly a 2-hour drive (closed in winter season). One can also take the tourist ferry from Lauvvik to Lysebotn in summer. The best season for walking is considered late June to September depending on snow conditions. Kjeragbolten Kjeragbolten is a boulder wedged in a mountain crevice by the edge of the Kjerag mountain (). It is possible to walk onto the rock without any equipment, but there is a direct drop below and then another gradient down to the Lysefjorden. The name means \\"Kjerag Boulder\\" or \\"Kjerag Bolt\\". BASE jumping Kjerag has become a popular BASE jumping destination. Since 1994, when Stein Edvartsen made the first officially registered jump, until 2016, a total number of jumps have been registered. During this time period there has been registered 131 accidents, of which 44 required the use of rescue helicopter and 10 cases where jumpers were rescued by other professional rescue climbers. According to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation there have been 11 fatal accidents involving BASE jumpers alone. A list of jumpers who perished at Kjerag is provided below: * Sebastian Dectot (24, from France), August 16, 1996 * Ulla- Stina √ñstberg (46, from Sweden), July 29, 1997 * Thor Alex Kappfjell (32, from Norway), July 6, 1999 * Kirill Goretov (29, from Russia), August 15, 1999 * Terry Forrestal (52, from the United Kingdom), June 10, 2000 * Valentino Venturi (30, from Italy), August 5, 2000 * Lori Barr (37, from the United States), July 23, 2002 * Rob Tompkins (30, from the United States), September 12, 2002 * Darcy Zoitsas (nickname: \\"Peter Pan\\") (39, from Australia), July 19, 2005 * Anton Knestyapin (25, from Russia), July 25, 2010 * Michael Leming (53, from the United States), June 25, 2016 In the Norwegian documentary film Loop, Kristen Reagan climbs up the drop before BASE jumping off the same cliff. Rock Climbing Kjerag was first climbed in the spring of 1985 by Pat Littlejohn, Steve Jones, Dick Renshaw and Lyndsey Foulkes, who abseiled in without sighting the wall from below, and chose their route from photographs in the public domain.

The red curve shows the function f, and the blue lines are the secants. For this particular case, the secant method will not converge to the visible root. In numerical analysis, the secant method is a root-finding algorithm that uses a succession of roots of secant lines to better approximate a root of a function f. The secant method can be thought of as a finite-difference approximation of Newton's method. However, the method was developed independently of Newton's method and predates it by over 3000 years. The method The secant method is defined by the recurrence relation : x_n = x_{n-1} - f(x_{n-1}) \\\\frac{x_{n-1} - x_{n-2}}{f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2})} = \\\\frac{x_{n-2} f(x_{n-1}) - x_{n-1} f(x_{n-2})}{f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2})}. As can be seen from the recurrence relation, the secant method requires two initial values, x0 and x1, which should ideally be chosen to lie close to the root. Derivation of the method Starting with initial values and , we construct a line through the points and , as shown in the picture above. In slope‚Äìintercept form, the equation of this line is :y = \\\\frac{f(x_1) - f(x_0)}{x_1 - x_0}(x - x_1) + f(x_1). The root of this linear function, that is the value of such that is :x = x_1 - f(x_1) \\\\frac{x_1 - x_0}{f(x_1) - f(x_0)}. We then use this new value of as and repeat the process, using and instead of and . We continue this process, solving for , , etc., until we reach a sufficiently high level of precision (a sufficiently small difference between and ): : \\\\begin{align} x_2 & = x_1 - f(x_1) \\\\frac{x_1 - x_0}{f(x_1) - f(x_0)}, [6pt] x_3 & = x_2 - f(x_2) \\\\frac{x_2 - x_1}{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}, [6pt] & \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\vdots [6pt] x_n & = x_{n-1} - f(x_{n-1}) \\\\frac{x_{n-1} - x_{n-2}}{f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2})}. \\\\end{align} Convergence The iterates x_n of the secant method converge to a root of f if the initial values x_0 and x_1 are sufficiently close to the root. The order of convergence is œÜ, where :\\\\varphi = \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\\\approx 1.618 is the golden ratio. In particular, the convergence is superlinear, but not quite quadratic. This result only holds under some technical conditions, namely that f be twice continuously differentiable and the root in question be simple (i.e., with multiplicity 1). If the initial values are not close enough to the root, then there is no guarantee that the secant method converges. There is no general definition of \\"close enough\\", but the criterion has to do with how \\"wiggly\\" the function is on the interval [x_0, x_1]. For example, if f is differentiable on that interval and there is a point where f' = 0 on the interval, then the algorithm may not converge. Comparison with other root-finding methods The secant method does not require that the root remain bracketed, like the bisection method does, and hence it does not always converge. The false position method (or ) uses the same formula as the secant method. However, it does not apply the formula on x_{n-1} and x_{n-2}, like the secant method, but on x_{n-1} and on the last iterate x_k such that f(x_k) and f(x_{n-1}) have a different sign. This means that the false position method always converges. The recurrence formula of the secant method can be derived from the formula for Newton's method :x_n = x_{n-1} - \\\\frac{f(x_{n-1})}{f'(x_{n-1})} by using the finite- difference approximation :f'(x_{n-1}) \\\\approx \\\\frac{f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2})}{x_{n-1} - x_{n-2}}. The secant method can be interpreted as a method in which the derivative is replaced by an approximation and is thus a quasi-Newton method. If we compare Newton's method with the secant method, we see that Newton's method converges faster (order 2 against œÜ ‚âà 1.6). However, Newton's method requires the evaluation of both f and its derivative f' at every step, while the secant method only requires the evaluation of f. Therefore, the secant method may occasionally be faster in practice. For instance, if we assume that evaluating f takes as much time as evaluating its derivative and we neglect all other costs, we can do two steps of the secant method (decreasing the logarithm of the error by a factor œÜ2 ‚âà 2.6) for the same cost as one step of Newton's method (decreasing the logarithm of the error by a factor 2), so the secant method is faster. If, however, we consider parallel processing for the evaluation of the derivative, Newton's method proves its worth, being faster in time, though still spending more steps. Generalizations Broyden's method is a generalization of the secant method to more than one dimension. The following graph shows the function f in red and the last secant line in bold blue. In the graph, the x intercept of the secant line seems to be a good approximation of the root of f. center Computational example Below, the secant method is implemented in the Python programming language. It is then applied to find a root of the function with initial points x_0 = 10 and x_1 = 30 def secant_method(f, x0, x1, iterations): Return the root calculated using the secant method. for i in range(iterations): x2 = x1 - f(x1) * (x1 - x0) / float(f(x1) - f(x0)) x0, x1 = x1, x2 return x2 def f_example(x): return x ** 2 - 612 root = secant_method(f_example, 10, 30, 5) print(\\"Root: {}\\".format(root)) # Root: 24.738633748750722 Notes  See also  * False position method References * * External links * Secant Method Notes, PPT, Mathcad, Maple, Mathematica, Matlab at Holistic Numerical Methods Institute * Category:Root-finding algorithms ","title":"Secant method"},{"id":"640752","text":"Ben Parker may refer to: *Uncle Ben, Ben Parker, Peter Parker's uncle from the Spider-Man series *Benjamin Richard Parker, son of Peter Parker and little brother of Spider-Girl in MC2 *Ben Parker (footballer) (born 1987), English football player *Ben L.

It is the straight shooting tube, usually made of rigid high-strength metal, through which a contained rapid expansion of high-pressure gas(es) is used to propel a projectile out of the front end (muzzle) at a high velocity. The hollow interior of the barrel is called the bore, and the diameter of the bore is called its caliber, usually measured in inches or millimetres. The first firearms were made at a time when metallurgy was not advanced enough to cast tubes capable of withstanding the explosive forces of early cannons, so the pipe (often built from staves of metal) needed to be braced periodically along its length for structural reinforcement, producing an appearance somewhat reminiscent of storage barrels being stacked together, hence the English name.A History of Warfare - Keegan, John, Vintage 1993  History  Gun barrels are usually metal. However, the early Chinese, the inventors of gunpowder, used bamboo, which has a strong, naturally tubular stalk and is cheaper to obtain and process, as the first barrels in gunpowder projectile weapons such as the fire lances. The Chinese were also the first to master cast-iron cannon barrels, and used the technology to make the earliest infantry firearms ‚Äî the hand cannons. Early European guns were made of wrought iron, usually with several strengthening bands of the metal wrapped around circular wrought iron rings and then welded into a hollow cylinder. Bronze and brass were favoured by gunsmiths, largely because of their ease of casting and their resistance to the corrosive effects of the combustion of gunpowder or salt water when used on naval vessels. Early firearms were muzzle-loading, with the gunpowder and then the shot loaded from the front end (muzzle) of the barrel, and were capable of only a low rate of fire due to the cumbersome loading process. The later-invented breech-loading designs provided a higher rate of fire, but early breechloaders lacked an effective way of sealing the escaping gases that leaked from the back end (breech) of the barrel, reducing the available muzzle velocity. During the 19th century, effective breechblocks were invented that sealed a breechloader against the escape of propellant gases. Early cannon barrels were very thick for their caliber. This was because manufacturing defects such as air bubbles trapped in the metal were common at that time, and played key factors in many gun explosions; these defects made the barrel too weak to withstand the pressures of firing, causing it to fail and fragment explosively.  Construction  240 mm howitzer in use in 1944 A gun barrel must be able to hold in the expanding gas produced by the propellants to ensure that optimum muzzle velocity is attained by the projectile as it is being pushed out. If the barrel material cannot cope with the pressure within the bore, the barrel itself might suffer catastrophic failure and explode, which will not only destroy the gun but also present a life-threatening danger to people nearby. Modern small arms barrels are made of carbon steel or stainless steel materials known and tested to withstand the pressures involved. Artillery pieces are made by various techniques providing reliably sufficient strength.  Fluting  A German Army G22 with fluted barrel In firearms terminology, fluting refers to the removal of material from a cylindrical surface, usually creating rounded grooves, for the purpose of reducing weight. This is most often done to the exterior surface of a rifle barrel, though it may also be applied to the cylinder of a revolver or the bolt of a bolt-action rifle. Most flutings on rifle barrels and revolver cylinders are straight, though helical flutings can be seen on rifle bolts and occasionally also rifle barrels. While the main purpose of fluting is just to reduce weight and improve portability, when adequately done it can retain the structural strength and rigidity and increase the overall specific strength. Fluting will also increase the surface-to-volume ratio and make the barrel more efficient to cool after firing, though the reduced material mass also means the barrel will heat up easily during firing.  Composite Barrels  A composite barrel is a firearm barrel that has been shaved down to be thinner and an exterior sleeve slipped over and fused to it that improves rigidity, weight and cooling. Most common form of composite barrel are those with carbon fiber sleeves, but there are proprietary examples such as the Teludyne Tech Straitjacket. They are seldom used outside sports and competition shooting.  Mounting  A barrel can be fixed to the receiver using action threads or similar methods.  Components   Chamber  A cartridge chambered into a Springfield M1903 Illustration of the various sections of a typical rifle chamber. The back end is to the left, and the front is to the right. ‚Äî body (purple), shoulder (pink) and neck (green). The chamber is the cavity at the back end of a breech-loading gun's barrel where the cartridge is inserted in position ready to be fired. In most firearms (rifles, shotguns, machine guns and pistols), the chamber is an integral part of the barrel, often made by simply reaming the rear bore of a barrel blank, with a single chamber within a single barrel. In revolvers, the chamber is a component of the gun's cylinder and completely separate from the barrel, with a single cylinder having multiple chambers that are rotated in turns into alignment with the barrel in anticipation of being fired. Structurally, the chamber consists of the body, shoulder and neck, the contour of which closely correspond to the casing shape of the cartridge it is designed to hold. The rear opening of the chamber is the breech of the whole barrel, which is sealed tight from behind by the bolt, making the front direction the path of least resistance during firing. When the cartridge's primer is struck by the firing pin, the propellant is ignited and deflagrates, generating high-pressure gas expansion within the cartridge case. However, the chamber (closed from behind by the bolt) restrains the cartridge case (or shell for shotguns) from moving, allowing the bullet (or shot/slug in shotguns) to separate cleanly from the casing and be propelled forward along the barrel to exit out of the front (muzzle) end as a flying projectile. The act of chambering a gun refers to the process of loading a cartridge into the gun's chamber, either manually as in single loading, or via operating the weapon's own action as in pump action, lever action, bolt action or self- loading actions. In the case of an air gun, a pellet (or slug) itself has no casing to be retained and will be entirely inserted into the chamber (often called \\"seating\\" or \\"loading\\" the pellet, rather than \\"chambering\\" it) before a mechanically pressurized gas is released behind the pellet and propels it forward, meaning that an air gun's chamber is functionally equivalent to the freebore portion of a firearm barrel. In the context of firearms design, manufacturing and modification, the word \\"chambering\\" has a different meaning, and refers to fitting a weapon's chamber specifically to fire a particular caliber or model of cartridge.  Bore  thumb300px Closeup of barrel throat area. The front is to the left, and back is to the right. The freebore (cyan) and leade (dark grey) transition into rifled bore (pale grey), and the comparison between freebore diameter vs. rifling groove and land diameter. The bore is the hollow internal lumen of the barrel, and takes up a vast majority portion of the barrel length. It is the part of the barrel where the projectile (bullet, shot, or slug) is located prior to firing and where it gains speed and kinetic energy during the firing process. The projectile's status of motion while travelling down the bore is referred to as its internal ballistics. Most modern firearms (except muskets, shotguns, most tank guns, and some artillery pieces) and air guns (except some BB guns) have helical grooves called riflings machined into the bore wall. When shooting, a rifled bore imparts spin to the projectile about its longitudinal axis, which gyroscopically stabilizes the projectile's flight attitude and trajectory after its exit from the barrel (i.e. the external ballistics). Any gun without riflings in the bore is called a smoothbore gun. When a firearm cartridge is chambered, its casing occupies the chamber but its bullet actually protrudes beyond the chamber into the posterior end of the bore. Even in a rifled bore, this short rear section is without rifling, and allows the bullet an initial \\"run-up\\" to build up momentum before encountering riflings during shooting. The most posterior part of this unrifled section is called a freebore, and is usually cylindrical. The portion of the unrifled bore immediately front of the freebore, called the leade, starts to taper slightly and guides the bullet towards the area where the riflingless bore transitions into fully rifled bore. Together they form the throat region, where the riflings impactfully ‚Äúbite‚Äù into the moving bullet during shooting. The throat is subjected to the greatest thermomechanical stress and therefore suffers wear the fastest. Throat erosion is often the main determining factor of a gun's barrel life.  Muzzle  Rheinmetall 120 mm smoothbore tank gun (seen from the muzzle) of a Leopard 2A4 Muzzle of a SIG 550 rifle, equipped with a birdcage-type flash suppressor Various types of shotgun chokes Muzzle blast modulated by an A2-style flash suppressor The muzzle is the front end of a barrel from which the projectile will exit.Quertermous & Quertermous, pp.429 Precise machining of the muzzle is crucial to accuracy, because it is the last point of contact between the barrel and the projectile. If inconsistent gaps exist between the muzzle and the projectile, escaping propellant gases may spread unevenly and deflect the projectile from its intended path (see transitional ballistics). The muzzle can also be threaded on the outside to allow the attachment of different accessory devices. In rifled barrels, the contour of a muzzle is designed to keep the rifling safe from damage by intruding foreign objects, so the front ends of the rifling grooves are commonly protected behind a recessed crown, which also serves to modulate the even expansion of the propellant gases. The crown itself is often recessed from the outside rim of the muzzle to avoid accidental damage from collision with the surrounding environment. In smooth bore barrels firing multiple sub-projectiles (such as shotgun shot), the bore at the muzzle end might have a tapered constriction called choke to shape the scatter pattern for better range and accuracy. Chokes are implemented as either interchangeable screw-in chokes for particular applications, or as fixed permanent chokes integral to the barrel. During firing, a bright flash of light known as a muzzle flash is often seen at the muzzle. This flash is produced by both superheated propellant gases radiating energy during expansion (primary flash), and the incompletely combusted propellant residues reacting vigorously with the fresh supply of ambient air upon escaping the barrel (secondary flash). The size of the flash depends on factors such as barrel length (shorter barrels have less time for complete combustion, hence more unburnt powder), the type (fast- vs. slow-burning) and amount of propellant (higher total amount means likely more unburnt residues) loaded in the cartridge. Flash suppressors or muzzle shrouds can be attached to the muzzle of the weapon to either diminish or conceal the flash. The rapid expansion of propellant gases at the muzzle during firing also produce a powerful shockwave known as a muzzle blast. The audible component of this blast, also known as a muzzle report, is the loud \\"bang\\" sound of gunfire that can easily exceed 140 decibels and cause permanent hearing loss to the shooter and bystanders. The non-audible component of the blast is an infrasonic overpressure wave that can cause damage to nearby fragile objects. Accessory devices such as muzzle brakes and muzzle boosters can be used to redirect muzzle blast in order to counter the recoil-induced muzzle rise or to assist the gas operation of the gun, and suppressors (and even muzzle shrouds) can be used to reduce the blast noise intensity felt by nearby personnel.

In 1853, Anthony Nathan de Rothschild completed the purchase and modernisation of Aston Clinton House and extensive estates in the area. The architect involved was George Devey, who was later to transform another Rothschild property, Ascott House. Old photographs of the house show a sprawling neo-Georgian/Italianate house with verandahs and a large porte-coch√®re. Many workers' cottages were built, and two schools and a village hall set up under Rothschild patronage. On the death of Lady Louise de Rothschild in 1910, the house was bequeathed to her two daughters, Constance, Lady Battersea and Annie, The Hon. Mrs. Eliot Yorke, who shared it as a holiday home, spending a few weeks together there each summer. In the First World War, like the adjoining Halton House and estate, Aston Clinton House was lent to the War Office, becoming in September 1914 the HQ of 21st Infantry Division. 21st Division was a \\"New Army\\" division, part of Kitchener's Army, and it was formed-up and trained on Rothschild land in Buckinghamshire, initially in Tring but in 1915 on the Halton and Aston Clinton estates. Four brigades of field artillery and one heavy battery received their advanced training in the grounds of Aston Clinton House in the spring and summer of 1915, including extensive gas offensive and defensive training. Final inspection of the division by Lord Kitchener occurred in August 1915 and the move to France took place from 2 to 13 September 1915. At the start of the Second World War the house was the Green Park Hotel, but during the War the stables were used by EKCO, an electronics company from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, as its main headquarters and for radar research and development, and the main house was used as a hospital for war wounded.Origins Journal of the Buckinghamshire Family History Society, December 2006 It later became a boys' prep school (where Evelyn Waugh began his teaching career as a junior master), followed by a further brief spell as a hotel. The main building was demolished between 1956 and 1958. Buckinghamshire County Council then acquired the property with the proviso that it be used for educational purposes. Today the estate is used as a residential training centre for young people. Many of the original ornamental features of the extended garden still remain, incorporated into the site now called Green Park. All that remain of the buildings of the estate are the stables, used as part of the training centre, and the lodge in Stablebridge Road.

Life Sanderson was born in Alnwick, Northumberland. His father, James, was a District Surveyor of taxes, thirteen years younger than his wife, Mary Ann (n√©e Rutherford How).The Bookbindings of T. J. Cobden-Sanderson, Marianne Tidcombe, The British Library, 1984, pg 1 Sanderson attended a number of schools including the Royal Grammar School Worcester before entering Owen's College (Manchester University) and then Trinity College, Cambridge to study law. He left without taking a degree, and entered Lincoln's Inn as a barrister. In 1882 he married (Julia Sarah) Anne Cobden, a socialist, and daughter of Richard Cobden, and they both took the surname Cobden-Sanderson. As a friend of William Morris, Cobden-Sanderson was involved with the Arts and Crafts ideology, and during a dinner party with the Morrises he was persuaded by Morris's wife Jane Burden to take up book-binding. In about 1884 he opened a workshop, abandoning his law practice. In 1887 Cobden-Sanderson suggested a new group be named the \\"Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society,\\" and in so doing gave the movement its name. His wife was concerned that his interests were too abstract and she encouraged him to become a bookbinder. In 1893 he set up the Doves Bindery in Hammersmith, London, naming it after a nearby pub, The Dove. It was his wife who took credit for keeping the business running. By 1900 he had established the Doves Press. Emery Walker became a partner in 1900 and oversaw the creation of the Doves Type used for all of their books. They produced a number of letterpress books, including a five-volume Doves Bible. By 1909 Cobden-Sanderson and his partner Emery Walker were at the height of a protracted and bitter dispute involving the rights to the Doves Type in the dissolution of their partnership. As part of the partnership dissolution agreement, all rights to the Doves Type were to pass to Emery Walker upon the death of Cobden-Sanderson. Yet, when the press closed in 1916 Cobden-Sanderson threw the type along with its punches and matrices into the Thames. In this time, as there was no digitization, destroying the punches and matrices constituted destroying the typeface itself. Until recently the Doves Typeface was thought to have been lost forever. However, a digital version of the typeface was painstakingly recreated by Robert Green from 2010 to 2013. In 2015, after searching the riverbed of the Thames near Hammersmith Bridge with help from the Port of London Authority, Green managed to recover 150 pieces of the original type. Cobden-Sanderson was a friend of John Russell, Viscount Amberley and his wife Kate, and made godfather of their son, the Nobel Prize in Literature-winning philosopher and activist Bertrand Russell; it 'had been long arranged that, boy or girl, (he) was to be godfather'.The Life of Bertrand Russell, Ronald W. Clark, Penguin Books, 1978, pg 424 Amberley had hoped that, in the event of his death, Cobden-Sanderson and the other godfather, biologist D. A. Spalding (who had tutored the Amberleys' children and lived in the household), as staunch atheists, would shield his son from a religious upbringing; after his parents' deaths Bertrand was however taken in by his grandparents, John Russell, 1st Earl Russell (Prime Minister from 1846‚Äì52, and again from 1865-6) and his second wife, Frances, daughter of Gilbert Elliot, 2nd Earl of Minto, under threat of legal action.The Life of Bertrand Russell, Ronald W. Clark, Penguin Books, 1978, pg 27-8 When Russell was convicted in 1918 for a public lecture against inviting the United States to participate in the First World War on the side of the United Kingdom, Cobden-Sanderson sent an encouraging letter of support ('with old and constant affection') expressing that he wished Russell's mother was alive to see her son's actions, part of what he considered 'a life fitted to the wonderful scene about (Russell)'.

Once elected, in the absence of an organized Labour Party, an MP elected on a Labour ticket would often support, or join, the Liberal Party of Canada and would often be described as \\"Liberal-Labour\\" At other times, the Liberal Party, particularly under William Lyon Mackenzie King would try to co-opt the trade union vote by running Liberal supporters as Labour or Liberal-Labour candidates. These would be official or unofficial \\"fusion\\" candidates who would run in the absence of a straight Liberal candidate. *Ralph Smith was a miner who won election to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1898 on a Liberal-Labour platform. In the 1900 federal election he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal-Labour candidate defeating the official Liberal candidate. He immediately joined the Liberal Party caucus of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and subsequently ran and won re-election as a straight Liberal against Conservative and Socialist opponents. *Alphonse Verville was president of the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada when he was elected as a Labour candidate in a 1906 by-election in Maisonville. Verville was elected by defeating a Liberal opponent, however, in subsequent elections the Liberals ran no candidate in Maisonville and threw their support to Verville who would generally support Sir Wilfrid Laurier's Liberals in the House of Commons of Canada. In the 1917 federal election on conscription, Verville ran and was re- elected as a Laurier-Liberal. *Malcolm Lang, who was elected as a Labour Party of Canada Member of Parliament in the 1926 federal election, was re-elected as \\"Liberal-Labour\\" in the north-eastern Ontario riding of Timiskaming South in the 1930 federal election. *Humphrey Mitchell was elected as a Labour MP in a 1931 by-election in Hamilton East. He was unopposed by the Mackenzie King Liberals and generally voted with the Liberal caucus while having a poor relationship with other Labour MPs in parliament. He refused to join the Co- operative Commonwealth Federation when it was formed the next year and, in the 1935 federal election ran for re-election as a Labour MP. The Liberals supported Mitchell unofficially and did not run a candidate against him. The CCF, however, did stand a candidate in Hamilton East resulting in the labour vote being split and Mitchell's defeat at the hands of a Conservative in a year where the Conservatives lost dozens of seats. Mitchell returned to parliament during World War II as a Liberal MP and cabinet minister. *From 1949 to 1965, William Moore Benidickson represented the north-western Ontario riding of Kenora-Rainy River as a Liberal-Labour Member of Parliament. Benidickson was elected as a Liberal MP in the 1945 federal election, but ran subsequently as \\"Liberal-Labour\\" as the result of an informal electoral pact between the Labor-Progressive Party (i.e., the Communist Party of Canada) and the Liberal Party of Canada (see also Ontario legislature, below.) Benidickson was succeeded in that riding by John Mercer Reid, who was elected as a \\"Liberal\\" in 1966 but then sat as a \\"Liberal-Labour\\" MP from the 1968 federal election until the 1972 federal election, when he changed his designation back to \\"Liberal\\". In the 1988 federal election, Liberal candidate Bob Nault identified himself as \\"Liberal-Labour\\" on some of his literature (particularly those distributed at plant gates) in his successful attempt to defeat NDP incumbent John Parry who had defeated Reid in 1984. Nault was officially listed as a straight Liberal on the ballot and in his official designation when he became an MP. *In the 1935 federal election, three candidates ran in Quebec ridings, placing last in each case, and drawing no more than 1.5% of the vote in each case. In all three ridings, at least one other candidate ran as a \\"Liberal\\". *In the 1945 federal election, one candidate ran as a \\"Liberal Labour\\" candidate in the Quebec riding of Mercier, placing last in a field of seven, with 345 votes, 1.0% of the total. *In the 1949 federal election, one candidate ran as a \\"Liberal Labour\\" candidate in the Quebec riding of Stanstead, placing last in a field of four, with 433 votes, 2.6% of the total. Liberal Labour Party The Liberal Labour Party name has been used twice in Canadian elections, though it may have been just a convenient label for those two candidates rather than an organized political party. In the 1926 federal election, Alexander Jarvis McComber, a barrister, placed second in a field of three candidates in the north-western Ontario riding of Port Arthur ‚Äì Thunder Bay, winning 2,990 votes, 26% of the total. No candidate ran as a \\"Liberal\\", but the third place candidate ran as a \\"Labour\\" candidate. In a 22 March 1954 by-election in Verdun, Quebec, Herv√© Ferland, an advertising agent, placed fifth in a field of seven candidates, which included one \\"Liberal\\" and two \\"Independent Liberals\\". He won 2,180 votes, 8.7% of the total. Liberal Labour Progressive In the 1926 federal election, the only opponent of the victorious Conservative candidate in the Algoma West riding in northern Ontario ran as a Liberal Labour Progressive candidate. Albert Ernest Whytall won 4,187 votes, or 37% of the total. Ontario legislature In the 1945 Ontario provincial election, the Communist Party (running as the Labor- Progressive Party) decided to run six candidates jointly with the Liberal Party of Ontario under Mitchell Hepburn. This was an attempt to marginalise the Ontario Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in elections to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The United Auto Workers (UAW) participated in the effort and ran three Liberal-Labour candidates against CCF incumbents in Windsor including George Burt, Canadian director of the UAW, Alexander A. Parent, a Communist and president of UAW Local 195. Parent was elected in Essex North but Burt and Reaume were both defeated, though vote-splitting also resulted in the defeat of two CCF incumbents. Another unsuccessful \\"Liberal- Labour\\" candidate was Arthur Reaume, mayor of Windsor, who had been a long time Tory and had run for George Drew's Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in 1943 provincial election, but broke with his party to support UAW workers at Ford in their fight for the Rand Formula. Reaume ran again as \\"Liberal-Labour\\" in the 1948 provincial election, without success, and was finally elected in the 1951 provincial election as a \\"Liberal\\". The other two Liberal-Labour MPPs elected were James Newman of Rainy River and Joseph Meinzinger of Waterloo North, defeating CCF incumbents George Lockhart and John Henry Cook, respectively. Of the three, only Newman would be re-elected in the 1948 provincial election. The decision by the Liberals, UAW members and Communists to collaborate was ironic given Hepburn's vociferous opposition to both Communism and the Congress of Industrial Organizations during his term as Premier of Ontario. Two pro-labour MPPs, David Croll and Arthur Roebuck, had resigned from Hepburn's cabinet in 1937 to protect to his anti-labour actions during a UAW strike in Oshawa, Ontario. (George Burt was Treasurer of the UAW's Oshawa local at the time of the strike.) The ridings of Kenora and Rainy River (separate ridings provincially, a single riding federally) continued to nominate \\"Liberal-Labour\\" candidates to both the Ontario legislature and the House of Commons of Canada for decades. Kenora had previously elected Peter Heenan as a Labour representative in the 1919 election. Heenan remained one of only four Labour MLAs (as MPPs were still known) re-elected in the 1923 election and was defeated in the 1926 election. He then entered federal politics becoming a federal Liberal and joining William Lyon Mackenzie King's Cabinet as Minister of Labour. In 1929 Earl Hutchinson recaptured Kenora as a Labour MLA. He was re-elected in 1934 but was persuaded to resign a few weeks later in order to allow Heenan ran in the subsequent by-election, this time as a Liberal. Heenan was elected and joined Mitchell Hepburn's Cabinet serving as Minister of Mines and Forests (1934-1941) and Minister of Labour (1941-1943) while Hutchinson was appointed vice-chairman of the Workmen's Compensation Board weeks after his resignation. Heenan was later defeated by William Docker of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in the 1943 provincial election in which the Liberals were reduced them to third party status. Subsequently, the Liberals ran Albert Wren as a \\"Liberal-Labour\\" candidate unsuccessfully in the 1948 election before his victory in the 1951 election. *Albert Wren of Kenora was the longest serving \\"Liberal-Labour\\" MPP, sitting in the Ontario legislature from 1951 until his death in 1961. He ran for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party in 1954, coming in second, and again in 1958, coming in last. Robert Gibson succeeded Wren as the \\"Liberal-Labour\\" MPP for Kenora and served until just prior to the 1967 provincial election. *T. Patrick Reid was elected \\"Liberal-Labour\\" MPP for the neighbouring riding of Rainy River in the 1967 provincial election He ran as a \\"Liberal\\" in the 1971 provincial election, and 1975 provincial election. He reverted to the \\"Liberal-Labour\\" label for the 1977 provincial election, and returned to being a \\"Liberal\\" MPP in 1981 provincial election, and left politics in 1984. More recently, Liberals in Kenora such as former Member of Parliament Bob Nault have occasionally used the \\"Liberal-Labour\\" tag on some of their campaign literature (such as that handed out at plant gates) though they are listed as straight Liberals on the ballot.

A breaking ball is not a specific pitch by that name, but is any pitch that \\"breaks\\", such as a curveball, slider, or slurve. A pitcher who primarily uses breaking ball pitches is often referred to as a junkballer. A breaking ball is more difficult than a straight pitch for a catcher to receive as breaking pitches sometimes hit the ground (whether intentionally, or not) before making it to the plate. A curveball moves down and to the left for a right handed pitcher. For a left hand pitcher, it moves down and to the right. And blocking a breaking ball requires thought and preparation by the catcher. The pitcher then, must have confidence in the catcher, and the catcher in himself, to block any ball in the dirt; if there are runners on base, they will likely advance if the ball gets away from the catcher. (Whether the pitcher is right- or left-handed will dictate which direction the catcher must turn his body to adjust for the spin of an upcoming breaking ball. This necessary movement may reveal the next intended pitch to the batter; therefore an experienced catcher must fake or mask his intentions when preparing for the pitch.) If a breaking ball fails to break, it is called a \\"hanging\\" breaking ball, or specifically, a \\"hanging\\" curve. The \\"hanger\\" presents a high, slow pitch that is easy for the batter to see, and often results in an extra-base hit or a home run.

The game is the second and final installment in the Laura Bow Mysteries line of adventure games, the first of which was The Colonel's Bequest. Unlike the first game, it was not written or designed by Roberta Williams, but she was a creative consultant on the project. It uses 8-bit color and a point-and-click interface. The CD-ROM version included voice acting. The Dagger of Amon Ra was developed using Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI1.1). Overall, this sequel owes little to the original game and is a much more traditional point-and- click game. It was re-released in 2017 on GOG.com with Windows support.  Gameplay  The Laura Bow games were distinctive in that they required some actual logical detective work on the part of the player; for the most part, though, the puzzles were of the typical variety of inventory and environment interaction (and frequent, often unexpected, player character death) found in most Sierra adventures. Gameplay uses a point-and-click interface featuring icons for different actions, similar to other Sierra games that were published during that time. An additional icon is used to ask characters a question about a topic listed in Laura's notebook, which auto-populates with names, places and other subjects that she has previously heard or encountered. The identity of the murderer is not automatically revealed at the end of the game. Instead, the player is asked a series of questions, ostensibly by the police, to prove that Laura had solved the crimes and discovered the secrets of the other suspects. If the questions are answered incorrectly, the coroner will give a hint to point the player towards the path that would have revealed the correct answer in subsequent playing of the games. The ending of the game can change depending on the answers given to the questions, most notably in that Laura can be killed if the player doesn't know the identity of the main murderer. The game includes \\"The Official Guide to the Leyendecker Museum\\",The game's creative director, Bill Davis, based the game's visual style, and named the game's central setting, after artist J. C. Leyendecker, per which also serves as the game's manual. It features a map of the main level of the museum and a rough drawing of the lower level.  Plot  The game is set in 1926, primarily in a museum, and reflects the Egyptology craze of the period. The protagonist is Laura Bow (a reference to Clara Bow), a Southern belle who has just graduated from Tulane University and moved to New York City, where she has landed a job at a prestigious newspaper The New York Daily Register News Tribune. For her first assignment, she is asked to write a story on the theft of an artifact from the museum's Egyptian exhibit. When a murder occurs during the party, however, she is locked inside with all of the other suspects. As other guests begin dying one by one, Laura must solve the numerous crimes occurring before the culprits escape or kill her. The game features four different endings, depending if Laura gathers enough evidence to expose both the murderer and the thief. These endings include combinations of the murderer going to prison or exacting revenge on Laura, being asked on a date with Steve, Laura's job status and the fate of the dagger.  Characters  * Laura Bow ‚Äì After graduating from Tulane University, Laura Bow was hired as a reporter by a prestigious New York newspaper. Her first assignment is to investigate and report on the theft of the Dagger of Amon Ra, taking over from the reporter Crodfoller T. Rhubarb. * Dr. Archibald Carrington III ‚Äì Formerly a curator of the British Museum, Dr. Carrington was appointed to become the new president of the Leyendecker Museum after the death of the previous president, Sterling Waldorf-Carlton. When the story begins, Archibald had worked at the museum for only a few weeks. * Yvette Delacroix ‚Äì Yvette is the amorous French secretary of the Leyendecker Museum president. She has worked as a secretary under both Dr. Archibald Carrington, the current president, and Sterling Waldorf-Carlton, Dr. Carrington's late predecessor. Years ago, Yvette worked as a call girl at a speakeasy. She has a deep sexual fondness for men and maintains relationships with several men at the same time including Ernie Leach and Detective Ryan O'Riley. * Dr. Pippin Carter ‚Äì An arrogant, self- important English archeologist, Dr. Carter was the one who discovered the Dagger of Amon Ra within a long-buried temple in Egypt. In the weeks before the story begins, he had been busy preparing the new Egyptology section for the Leyendecker museum. Dr. Carter is fastidiously attentive to his personal hygiene and appearance. He sometimes talks about, and compares himself to, his cousin, who is implied to be the famous archaeologist Howard Carter. * Wolf Heimlich ‚Äì As Chief of Security at the Leyendecker Museum, Wolf is obsessed with order and takes to his duties with an almost fanatical devotion. Dressed in a German military uniform, Wolf can often be found patrolling the museum grounds in a goosestep march. He also collects weapons of various types, keeping them in his office. Wolf is in a relationship with Dr. Olympia Myklos. * Dr. Olympia Myklos ‚Äì A native of Athens, Greece, Dr. Myklos is a curator at the Leyendecker Museum, specializing in paleontology. She has a morbid fascination with death and keeps exotic pet animals, including a ferret named Daisy and an Egyptian cobra named Barney. * Ernie Leach ‚Äì Ernie is the custodian and handyman of the Leyendecker Museum. A hard-working, African American man, Ernie took employment at the museum to pay off his gambling debts to a loan shark. * Ryan Hanrahan O'Riley ‚Äì An Irish American detective in the NYPD, O'Riley is the detective assigned to investigate the theft of the Dagger of Amon Ra. He keeps fit every day and is fond of grapes. * Steve Dorian ‚Äì An art student, Steve Dorian works as a part-time dockworker to meet his financial needs. His name is a pun on the word \\"stevedore\\". * Dr. Ptahsheptut \\"Tut\\" Smith ‚Äì A curator from the Egyptian Museum who is deeply opposed to Dr. Carter's claim over the Dagger of Amon Ra. His arguments with Dr. Pippin Carter concerning the Dagger have almost come to blows at times. * Lawrence \\"Ziggy\\" Ziegfeld ‚Äì A small-time local criminal who sometimes works for the NYPD as an informant in exchange for leniency. He has many connections and resources within the criminal underworld and can often be found in one of New York's many speakeasies. Due to his status as a \\"stool pigeon\\", he is distrusted by criminals and police officers alike. Because of this, he is extremely paranoid and his face often twitches nervously. * Rameses Najeer ‚Äì An Egyptian accountant of the museum, he is opposed to Dr. Carter's claim over the Dagger of Amon Ra. Rameses is a successful man who is married with one child and another on the way. He is extremely proud of his Egyptian heritage despite the fact that he has lived in the United States for many years. Others describe him as a hard worker and a good family man, but he can be intense and passionate at times. * Countess Lavinia Waldorf-Carlton ‚Äì The widow of the previous museum president, Sterling Waldorf-Carlton. She is currently engaged in a legal battle concerning Sterling's will and her entitlements as his spouse. Apparently, Sterling and Lavinia met during a trip on board an ocean liner about a year ago and married only a month or two later. * Sam Augustini ‚Äì The editor-in-chief of The New York Daily Register News Tribune, he is Laura's boss and the one who hired her to write a story on the museum's benefit party. He is close friends with Laura's father, John Bow, who once saved the editor's life. * Crodfoller T. \\"Rhub\\" Rhubarb ‚Äì Laura's co-worker, he tries to help Laura whenever possible, but is also reluctant of Augustini's decision to send Laura to write a report of the dagger's theft when she is only just a rookie. If Laura fails to solve the murder mysteries and dagger theft, he would take over the case and solve them instead. * Lo Fat ‚Äì Lo Fat is the jocular, Chinese American owner of Lo Fat's Laundry; a Chinese laundry in New York City. Originally from Newark, New Jersey, Fat is a faithful patron of the Leyendecker Museum. Through his business, he has made acquaintances with many major contributors to the museum. Laura acquires the names of many of the supporting characters through Fat's connections. Fat is also responsible for providing Laura with her distinctive evening dress for the museum party. * Watney Little ‚Äì A known English fugitive and con artist wanted by Scotland Yard. Reports indicate that he has recently escaped from Dartmoor Prison. The local police are still investigating the circumstances behind the escape. * Henri Le Mort ‚Äì The coroner who holds the inquest into the murders at the Leyendecker museum and the theft of the Dagger of Amon Ra. He asks Laura a variety of questions about the murders, the theft and other matters which may have a bearing on the case. * Rocco ‚Äì A taxi driver who shares interesting facts of the times, such as the first transatlantic radiotelephone call, while transporting Laura to various locations in the game.  Reception  Computer Gaming World stated that Amon Ra was \\"much improved over\\" The Colonel's Bequest. The magazine criticized the \\"slow and repetitive\\" gameplay in the first two acts, and the possibility of unwinnable situations, but said that from Act 3 on \\"the game is very difficult to set aside\\". It praised Amon Ra as a \\"visual and aural treat\\", stating that its creators \\"should be justifiably proud\\", approved of the game's serious, realistic tone with \\"a touch of humor\\", and called the use of a female protagonist \\"refreshing\\". The magazine concluded that the game was \\"another quality adventure from the fertile minds at Sierra\\". In April 1994 the magazine said that Amon Ra had a \\"much more believable 1920s setting\\" than its predecessor, and \\"calls on the player's attention to detail and deductive reasoning skills\\". The game received 4 out of 5 stars in Dragon. Cynthia E. Field of PC Games called Amon Ra \\"a captivating whodunit\\" and praised the game's \\"near-perfect blending of sound effects, music, and graphics\\". In April 1994 Computer Gaming World said that the CD version's \\"Hand-painted art, emotive stereo soundtrack, deep puzzles, and a convoluted storyline all combine to make this multimedia game a winner\\".

Lange vastly extended the second edition published in two volumes in 1873‚Äì75. A three-volume English translation of the opus was published 1877‚Äì81.Andrew Seth: Review of History of Materialism, in Mind, vol. 7, no. 25., 1882, pp. 124-136. Contents Adopting the Kantian standpoint that we can know nothing but phenomena, Lange maintains that neither materialism nor any other metaphysical system has a valid claim to ultimate truth. For empirical phenomenal knowledge, however, which is all that humans can look for, materialism with its exact scientific methods has done most valuable service. Ideal metaphysics, though they fail of the inner truth of things, have a value as the embodiment of high aspirations, in the same way as poetry and religion. Lange replaced the transcendental subject of Kantianism by the organism, although he considered that this substitution validated all the more Kant's philosophy that the subject apprehended the world through the categories of understanding. Lange suggests that the methods for real science were present in Democritus's atomistic materialism. However, atomistic materialism implies that the soul, like the body, is fated to be snuffed out: such a view made Democritus quite unattractive to virtually all world religions so Democritus was ignored and marginalized by the history of philosophy, in spite of being one of the greatest thinkers of the ancient Greek world. Lange mentions Max Stirner's book The Ego and Its Own as \\"the extremest that we know anywhere\\".\\"Stirner went so far in his notorious work, Der Einzige und Sein Eigenthum (1845), as to reject all moral ideas. Everything that in any way, whether it be external force, belief, or mere idea, places itself above the individual and his caprice, Stirner rejects as a hateful limitation of himself. What a pity that to this book -- the extremest that we know anywhere -- a second positive part was not added. It would have been easier than in the case of Schelling's philosophy; for out of the unlimited Ego I can again beget every kind of Idealism as my will and my idea. Stirner lays so much stress upon the will, in fact, that it appears as the root force of human nature. It may remind us of Schopenhauer. Thus there are two sides to everything.\\" -- History of Materialism, Second Book, First Section, Chapter II, \\"Philosophical Materialism since Kant\\" He also mentioned Blanqui's L'Eternit√© par les astres, which discussed the thesis of an Eternal Return. Lange's work exerted a profound influence on Friedrich Nietzsche, who aimed at radicalizing Lange's viewpoint beyond Kant.Alfred Fouill√©e, \\"Note sur Nietzsche et Lange: le \\"retour √©ternel\\", in Revue philosophique de la France et de l'√©tranger. An. 34. Paris 1909. T. 67, S. 519-525 At one time Nietzsche planned to write a dissertation on the notion of organism in Kant's philosophy (letter to Paul Deussen ). He also envisioned sending a work on Democritus, a major focus of Lange, to Deussen.Chapter I of Stirner and Nietzsche by Albert L√©vy (Paris, Alcan, 1904)  See also  * Relationship between Friedrich Nietzsche and Max Stirner Notes References * Friedrich Nietzsche's letter to Gersdorff, September 1866 External links * The History Of Materialism And Criticism Of Its Present Importance (1950), in one volume.

He served in the Colonial Assembly and as attorney general of the colony in 1721‚Äì23. His son William was later a major general in the Continental Army during the American revolution. Alexandria Township, New Jersey was named after James Alexander. Early life Alexander was born in Muthill in Perthshire, Scotland on May 27, 1691, to David Alexander (\\"of Muthil\\"). He was a distant relation of the Earl of Stirling and may have received his formal education at the High School of Stirling. He joined the navy, serving on HMS Arundell in 1712‚Äì13, where he learned navigation, mathematics, and astronomy. But in 1714‚Äì15, he joined the uprising in support of James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, and fled to America in 1715 when it failed. Life in America In November 1715, he was appointed surveyor general of New Jersey. He personally made surveys, using instruments he had brought from Scotland and resolved disputed titles. Alexander settled in New York, and in January 1721 after marrying, he was appointed deputy- secretary of New York. Legal career Alexander read law in New York and was admitted to the provincial bar of New Jersey in 1720. He served as attorney general for the colony of New York from 1721 to 1723. Alexander sought membership of Gray's Inn on February 1, 1725, and returned from London with a large legal library that enabled him to cite legal precedent in court. This was a distinct advantage for a colonial lawyer. James Duane, ward and later son-in-law of Robert Livingston, third Lord of Livingston Manor, read law as a clerk in Alexander's office and became proficient in the area of rights and jurisdiction in land disputes. Alexander practiced law, engaged in mercantile pursuits, and built a considerable fortune. He built a large brick mansion at Broad and Beaver Streets. Politics In 1721, Alexander was appointed to the Governor's Council in New York. In 1723, he was added to the Council in New Jersey and that same year made Attorney General of New Jersey. He frequently opposed the policies of New York Governor William Cosby and in 1732, Cosby succeeded in having Alexander removed from the council. In 1733, Alexander started an anti-Cosby newspaper, the New York Weekly Journal, with Peter Zenger as publisher. Alexander was the principal author of pieces critical of Governor Cosby. The following year, Zenger was arrested on sedition charges, but eventually a jury acquitted Zenger in one of the first instances of jury nullification. Alexander and William Smith served as Zenger's attorneys until both were disbarred after they challenged the commissions of the judges hearing the case.Linder, Douglas O., \\"Key Figures in the Trial of John Peter Zenger\\", Famous Trials, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law In 1730, Alexander was chairman of the committee to revise the New York City charter; he was given the freedom of the city the following year. When Lord De La Warr was appointed governor in 1737, Alexander was reinstated to the bar and reappointed to the governor's Council of New York. His removal from the Council of New Jersey was disregarded. Alexander became a vocal proponent of the emerging Whig political views, and engaged in various civic efforts as well. In 1751, he raised funds to establish King's College. Later life Although he remained active in politics, his legal practice eventually absorbed most of his time and energy, and his political involvement waned. He was an original member of the American Philosophical Society, founded in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin, Alexander, Francis Hopkinson, John Bartram, Philip Syng, Jr. and others.Duer, William Alexander.

Retrieved 31 December 2015. Personal life On June 5, 1721, Alexander married the wealthy widow Mary Spratt Provoost (1693‚Äì1760). She was the daughter of John Spratt (c. 1650‚Äì1697) and Maria de Peyster (1659‚Äì1700). Her DePuyster uncles drafted the prenuptial agreements. Mary was the widow of Samuel Provoost (d. 1719), the younger brother of David Proovost, the 24th mayor of New York City, with whom she had three children. Together, James and Mary had seven children: * Mary Alexander II (1721‚Äì1767), who married Peter Van Brugh Livingston (1710‚Äì1792), the son of Philip Livingston and brother of Governor William Livingston, in 1739. * James Alexander (1723‚Äì1731), who died young. * William Alexander (1725‚Äì1783), who married Sarah Livingston (1725‚Äì1805), a daughter of Philip Livingston, in 1748. * Elizabeth Alexander (1726‚Äì1800), who married John Stevens (1715‚Äì1792), the Vice President of the New Jersey Legislative Council. * Catherine Alexander (1727‚Äì1801), who married Walter Rutherfurd (1723‚Äì1804), who was born in Edgerston, Scotland, in 1758. * Anna Alexander (1731‚Äì1736), who died young. * Susannah Alexander (1737‚Äì1777), who married John Reid (1721‚Äì1807), a British army General and founder of the chair of music at the University of Edinburgh. In 1756, while on a trip to Albany to confer with other Whig leaders, he suffered a flare up of his gout which led to a deterioration of his health. He returned home ill as a result and died in Albany or New York City on April 2, 1756. Descendants Through his daughter Mary, he was the grandmother of 12 grandchildren, including Philip Peter Livingston (1740‚Äì1810). Through his son William, he was the grandfather of three, William Alexander, Mary Alexander, who married a wealthy merchant named Robert Watts of New York, and Catherine Alexander, who married Congressman William Duer (1747‚Äì1799). Through his daughter Elizabeth, he was the grandfather of John Stevens III (1749‚Äì1838), a lawyer, engineer, and inventor who constructed the first U.S. steam locomotive and first steam- powered ferry, and Mary Stevens (d. 1814), who married Chancellor Robert Livingston, negotiator of the Louisiana Purchase. Through his daughter Catherine, he was the grandfather of John Rutherfurd (1760‚Äì1840), a Federalist member of the United States Senate from New Jersey who served from 1791 to 1798, who married Helena Magdalena Morris (1762‚Äì1840), daughter of Congressman Lewis Morris of Morrisania.

In his original incarnation, he was a superhero who, with his teen sidekicks, Jan and Jace, and Blip the monkey, fought supervillains in outer space. In the 1990s, Space Ghost was brought back as a host for his own fictional late-night talk show, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, on Cartoon Network and Adult Swim. In the 2000s, he was revamped as a serious superhero once again in a mini-series by DC Comics. Television series Space Ghost and Dino Boy The original series debuted in September 1966. In the original series, Space Ghost was an intergalactic crime fighter from the Ghost Planet. He had the ability to be invisible (via his belt), fly, and shoot various rays from the powerbands on his wrists. Space Ghost would fight such recurring supervillains as Moltar, Zorak, Black Widow, Metallus, Brak and Creature King with the help of his sidekicks: Jan, Jayce, and their pet monkey, Blip. The original series shared time with an unrelated segment called Dino Boy in the Lost Valley. During its original run, there were a total of 42 Space Ghost episodes and 18 Dino Boy episodes. The series ended in 1968, but remained in syndication during the 1970s. Space Ghost was voiced by Gary Owens, who is best known for being the announcer for Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. Space Stars Twenty-two new Space Ghost segments appeared on Space Stars on NBC in 1981. The episodes introduced a new assortment of villains including an evil version of Space Ghost named Space Spectre who came from an alternate universe. As in the original series, Space Ghost often came to the aid of The Herculoids and vice versa. The Phantom Cruiser was given a more modern redesign as well. They also frequently crossed paths with the Teen Force and it appeared that Jan and Teen Force member Kid Comet were dating as well. Gary Owens reprised his role as Space Ghost, while Steve J. Spears played the role of Jace and Alexandra Stoddart played Jan. Space Ghost Coast to Coast The character Space Ghost hosted a talk show, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, which began broadcasting in 1994 on Cartoon Network. The show spoofed late-night talk shows, with one- time villains Zorak and Moltar serving as Space Ghost's sidekicks (with occasional guest appearances from other Space Ghost villains, particularly Brak). In this version, Space Ghost is voiced by George Lowe, and his real name is Tad Ghostal. The show reused animation cels from the Hanna-Barbera archives. The show ran from 1994 to 1999, and returned with two new episodes in 2001, moving to the Adult Swim programming block later that year; the series ended its Adult Swim run in 2004. The characters of Jan, Jace, and Blip (Space Ghost's old sidekicks) appeared twice on the show. After approximately eight seasons, the show went into hiatus. New episodes of Space Ghost Coast to Coast appeared on the \\"Animation\\" channel of the GameTap service, beginning on May 30, 2006. On May 31, 2008, the show ended when the TV section of GameTap shut down. Cartoon Planet Following the popularity of Coast to Coast, the show provided a spin-off series, Cartoon Planet; the show ran from 1995 to 1998. Cartoon Planet was an hour-long cartoon block hosted by Space Ghost with his imprisoned sidekicks Zorak and Brak; the segments in-between the cartoons usually consisted of skits and original songs. Due to the popularity of the series' songs, two albums were released: Space Ghost's Surf & Turf and Space Ghost's Musical Bar-B-Que. Lowe provided the voice for Space Ghost on both records. The voice on these recordings is totally computer generated, using a custom software program that Lowe had written. Other appearances * Space Ghost also appeared in some of the Adult Swim projects: ** In the Robot Chicken episode \\"Suck It,\\" he was seen as a member of the Adult Swim Council alongside Peter Griffin from Family Guy and Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. ** In an episode of Perfect Hair Forever, he is attacked by a bear and is friends with a shark. ** Space Ghost appeared in four episodes of The Brak Show. ** Space Ghost and Zorak make cameos in Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film For Theaters, where he is killed by a missile that Meatwad launches. ** In a scene of the Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode \\"Multiple Meat\\", when an older version of Frylock returns home, Space Ghost can be seen in a dumpster outside the Aqua Teens' home. * Space Ghost along with Birdman appeared in the background in multiple scenes of the Season 4 episode of The Powerpuff Girls titled \\"Members Only\\".

On May 6, 2004, the FBI arrested Mayfield as a material witness in connection with the Madrid attacks, and held him for over two weeks. Mayfield was charged, and an FBI internal review later acknowledged serious errors in their investigation. Ensuing lawsuits have resulted in a formal apology from the U.S. government and a $2 million settlement. An initial ruling declared some provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act unconstitutional, but the United States government appealed, and the ruling was overturned. Mayfield's case has been referenced in numerous scientific, political, and social journals. Early life and career Brandon Mayfield was born in Coos Bay, Oregon, and grew up in Halstead, Kansas. He served in the United States Army Reserve from 1985 to 1989, and then as an officer in the Army in Bitburg, Germany, from 1992 to 1994. He met his wife Mona, an Egyptian national and the daughter of a college professor, on a blind date in Olympia, Washington, in 1986, and converted to Islam shortly afterwards. They have lived in Beaverton, Oregon, off and on since 1989. Although he was a regular worshiper at a Beaverton mosque prior to his arrest, his colleagues were unaware of his religious beliefs. The imam of the mosque has described Mayfield as \\"very patriotic.\\" The Mayfields have four children. He studied law at Washburn University and Lewis & Clark College, receiving his law degree from Washburn in 1999, and practicing family law in Newport before moving to the Portland area. Mayfield performed work for the Modest Means Program of the Oregon State Bar, which matches attorneys who are willing to work at reduced rates for low-income clients. In 2003, he offered legal aid to Jeffrey Leon Battle, one of the Portland Seven, a group of people convicted of trying to travel to Afghanistan to help the Taliban. Battle at the time was involved in a child custody case.  False accusation in 2004 bombing   Arrest and detention  Following the 2004 Madrid train bombings fingerprints on a bag containing detonating devices were found by Spanish authorities. The Spanish National Police shared the fingerprints with the FBI through Interpol. Twenty possible matches for one of the fingerprints were found in the FBI database and one of the possible matches was Brandon Mayfield. His prints were in the FBI database as they were taken as part of standard procedure when he joined the military. He became the prime suspect because of his conversion to Islam and because he had represented one of the Portland Seven. The FBI described the fingerprint match as \\"100% verified\\". According to the court documents in judge Ann Aiken's decision, this information was largely \\"fabricated and concocted by the FBI and DOJ\\". When the FBI finally sent Mayfield's fingerprints to the Spanish authorities, they contested the matching of the fingerprints from Brandon Mayfield to the ones associated with the Madrid bombing. Further, the Spanish authorities informed the FBI they had other suspects in the case, Moroccan immigrants not linked to anyone in the US. The FBI continued surveillance of Mayfield and his family despite the information received from the Spanish authorities. Mayfield was concerned for the safety of his children and wife, and according to his father, he suspected that he was under surveillance by the federal authorities. In the weeks before his arrest, Mayfield's family was under the impression that their house had been broken into at least twice, although nothing was stolen. According to court documents, the FBI used national security letters in order to wiretap his phones, bug his house, and search his house several times.Mayfield v. Ashcroft, As was discovered during the court case, the FBI's records show that this fingerprint, despite the sworn testimony of FBI and DOJ agents, was in all reality not an exact match but only one of 20 prints \\"similar\\" to the ones retrieved from Madrid. Based on that list of people with \\"similar prints\\" the FBI launched an extensive investigation of all 20 individuals using letters of national security. The investigation included medical records, financial records, employment records, etc. on all 20 people and their families. It was during this investigation that Brandon Mayfield's name rose to the top of the list. The FBI arrested Mayfield at his offices in West Slope, an unincorporated suburb of Portland. The arrest was similar to the then-recent Mike Hawash case, under a material witness warrant rather than under charge; he was held with no access to family and limited access, if any, to legal counsel. The FBI initially refused to inform either Mayfield or his family why he was being detained or where he was being held. Later, the FBI leaked the nature of the charges to the local media and the family learned of the charges by watching the local news. He was at first held at a Multnomah County jail under a false name; he was later transferred to an unidentified location. His family protested that Mayfield had no connection with the bombings, nor had he been off the continent in over 11 to 14 years.  Release  Before his arrest, Spanish authorities informed the FBI in a letter dated April 13, 2004, that they reviewed the fingerprint on the bag as a negative match of Mayfield's fingerprint, though this letter was not communicated to Mayfield's attorneys. On May 19 the Spanish authorities announced that the fingerprints actually belonged to an Algerian national, Ouhnane Daoud; Brandon Mayfield was released from prison when the international press broke the story the next day‚ÄîMay 20, 2004. A gag order remained in force for the next few days. By May 25, the case was dismissed by the judge, who ordered the return of seized evidence and unsealing of documents pertaining to his arrest. The FBI conducted an internal review of Mayfield's arrest and detention, concluding that although he was not arrested solely due to his religious beliefs, they may have contributed to investigator's failure to take into account the Spanish concerns over fingerprint identification.USDOJ Report The FBI issued a press release announcing the report's conclusion that they had not misused the USA PATRIOT Act in the investigation.Fingerprint misidentification of Brandon Mayfield ‚Äì Federal Bureau of Investigation Civil libertarians and the ACLU nonetheless consider Mayfield's detention a misuse of the material witness statute.Administration Abuses Material Witness Law ‚Äì TalkLeft.com The FBI later admitted wrongdoing and apologized for their acts. In response, Mayfield filed several lawsuits over this invasion of his privacy. One sought to force the government to return or destroy copies of items seized from his home. Another, which was argued before U.S. district court Judge Ann Aiken on July 15, 2005, challenged the law which was used against him as unconstitutional. The Federal Government filed several motions to have Mayfield's case dismissed as a matter of national security, or national secrets, but these were denied by Judge Aiken.  Court's ruling and aftermath  The case was heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Among the issues on appeal was whether materials removed from Mayfield's house, including DNA samples taken from his family's personal toothbrushes, were to be destroyed or preserved. The Federal Government assumed the position that materials must be preserved so that they can be referred to, if more lawsuits are brought in the future. On November 29, 2006, the U.S. government settled part of the lawsuit with Mayfield for a reported $2 million. The government issued a formal apology to Mayfield as part of the settlement. The settlement allowed Mayfield to pursue a legal challenge against the Patriot Act.Wrongly accused man settles bomb suit ‚Äì news.yahoo.com The FBI was also cleared of wrongdoing in an earlier internal investigation. On September 26, 2007, two provisions of the U.S. Patriot Act were declared unconstitutional. Finding in Mayfield's favor, Judge Aiken ruled that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, \\"now permits the executive branch of government to conduct surveillance and searches of American citizens without satisfying the probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment,\\" which violates the Constitution of the United States. The Federal government appealed that ruling, and Mayfield's attorney, Elden Rosenthal, argued in front of the Ninth Circuit court on February 5, 2009. The ruling was overturned in December 2009 on the ground that the Court found the plaintiff, Mayfield, not to have standing.  Subsequent work  Between 2015 and 2017, Mayfield participated in a campaign with CAIR, the ACLU, and the National Lawyers Guild to press for the Portland City Council to sever ties with the Joint Terrorism Task Force, citing surveillance and immigration issues. In 2018 Brandon Mayfield represented Yonas Fikre before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, successfully persuading the court that damages done to the man by his placement on the No Fly List and interference with his attempts to return to the United States gave him standing to challenge the unconstitutionality of the policy.

In 2003, he went 3-1 despite an ERA of 4.43 in 62 games and 1 start. Minnesota Twins In December 2003, the Twins acquired Silva from Philadelphia along with Nick Punto and Bobby Korecky in exchange for Eric Milton, who had been a staple of the Minnesota rotation since 1998. With the Twins, Silva made a successful conversion from reliever to starter, in one of the biggest surprises in the 2004 season. He posted a 14‚Äì8 mark in 203 innings pitched and finished second in the rotation behind Cy Young winner Johan Santana. In 2005, he induced more double plays (34) than any other pitcher in the majors. In 2005, he set the record for fewest walks allowed per 9 innings in the modern era with an average of .43 BB/9 innings. On May 20, 2005, Silva set a record since 1957 for the fewest pitches thrown (74) in a nine-inning complete game. In May 2006, Silva was demoted to the bullpen after struggling through the beginning of the season. In June, he re-entered the rotation when the struggling # 5 starter, Scott Baker, was demoted to the Twins' Triple-A team in Rochester. He gave up a major-league-worst 1.90 home runs per 9 innings, giving up 38‚Äîmore than any other major league pitcher, and had a major-league-worst batting average against of .326.

He also spent time on the DL with a sore elbow.http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-08-16-217426260_x.htm He finished 4-15 as he managed to win just one game after the month of April. Fresh off the WBC, Silva started the 2009 season slower than expected, with very little control over his pitches, and a high ERA. He sat out most of the season with a shoulder injury. Silva returned at near the end of the season for 2 appearances in relief, giving up one run in 0.2 innings to the Yankees on September 19 and one run on September 25 in Toronto in one inning. Chicago Cubs On December 18, 2009 Silva was traded along with $9 million to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder Milton Bradley. Silva appeared to have turned his career around early in 2010, becoming the first Cubs starter since 1967 to begin a season with an 8‚Äì0 record. However, his success was very limited for the remainder of the season, and he was cut from the Cubs towards the end of spring training in 2011.

He played as a flanker or number eight for London Wasps and never played for another club, having arrived at Sudbury as a teenager. Playing in all three positions in the back row, he won 85 caps for England, and was part of the team that won the 2003 World Cup. He is one of a very small number of players to have won both the Rugby World Cup and Sevens World Cup.Matt Dawson, Mils Muliaina and Waisake Naholo are others. He went on three tours with the British and Irish Lions, winning three caps. He now regularly works as a pundit on television rugby coverage and on radio. Early life Dallaglio was born in Shepherd's Bush, London. He was educated at King's House School in Richmond and boarded at Ampleforth College where he was affectionately known as \\"Del Boy\\", (though he actually attained his A-levels at The Oxford School of Learning), and at Kingston University to study Property Development. His sister Francesca, a 19-year-old student ballerina, died in the Marchioness disaster in 1989. In 1985, as a 12-year-old chorister in the King's House School choir, Dallaglio and 20 other choristers sang backing vocals on the song \\"We Don't Need Another Hero\\" by Tina Turner. This only became known in 2005, when the Musicians' Union, having realised that the choristers had not been paid royalties on the record, attempted to track them down. As part of the same choir, Dallaglio sang at the wedding of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. Because Dallaglio's father, Vincenzo, is Italian, and his English-born mother, Eileen, was of Irish descent he was eligible to play for both Italy and Ireland, as well as England, and in the early 1990s he turned down an invitation to play for Ireland. Club career In 1998 Dallaglio became club captain when Dean Ryan and Rob Andrew left for Newcastle in October 1995, taking four experienced players with them. Dallaglio held the team together and 12 months later led Wasps to the first English league title of the professional era. Dallaglio had a good season in 1999‚Äì2000, when he regained the club captaincy. Although Wasps' league form was disappointing, he led them to the quarter finals of the Heineken Cup and to a second successive Tetley's Bitter Cup victory. Dallaglio returned from an ankle injury early in the 2006‚Äì07 domestic season to reclaim the club captaincy at Wasps, but an indifferent Guinness Premiership season ended with them failing to qualify for the play-offs for the first time since the introduction of the knockout system. However, Dallaglio and his teammates saved their best performances for the Heineken Cup; he led the club to its second European championship win on 20 May 2007. The final, played at Twickenham, set a world record for the highest attendance figure for a club rugby match (at around 82,000). Wasps' opponents, Leicester Tigers had already won the EDF Energy Cup and the Guinness Premiership trophies and were favourites to achieve an unprecedented Treble, especially as they had beaten Wasps 40‚Äì26 at Welford Road less than a month earlier, but it was Wasps who emerged as victors, winning the game 25‚Äì9. In the following season he joined London Wasps late because of the Rugby World Cup. He returned to find London Wasps struggling near the bottom of the Guinness Premiership. Wasps fortunes quickly changed. They made it through the group in the EDF Cup, and started climbing up the table. Despite this good form in domestic competitions, they narrowly failed to make it out of their Heineken Cup group. They lost out to Munster, the eventual winners, but could have made it out if they had beaten them in Ireland in the final matchday of pool play. They soon hit top form in the Premiership, winning game after game. They reached the play-offs and drew a home match against Bath. They won the game 21-6, but lost rising star Danny Cipriani to an injury. Leicester Tigers beat Gloucester to qualify for the Premiership final. This match was to be Lawrence Dallaglio's last ever match, and it was to be played in front of a capacity crowd of 81,600 at Twickenham. They were made to fight, but eventually won 26-16. Dallaglio later claimed it was Wasps' greatest Premiership title, noting the damaging effect the Rugby World Cup had on their squad. In the 67th minute of the Premiership final, he was substituted, and received a standing ovation by the sell out crowd. Lawrence made a sly appearance, at blindside flanker, for London Wasps \\"A\\" Team in the Guinness A League on 8 September 2008. He was getting game time before he captained an England XV for the Help For Heroes game at Twickenham on 20 September later that month. International Dallaglio was a member of the inaugural World Cup Sevens-winning squad with England in 1993. He was then a surprise choice for the 1994 England tour to South Africa. Yet the following winter he was not guaranteed a place in Wasps' back-row. He made his debut for England in November 1995 as a substitute against the Springboks and toured South Africa as a member of the 1997 British & Irish Lions squad. He was given the England captaincy in the autumn of 1997 by new coach Clive Woodward, taking over from Phil de Glanville. The other candidate for the job, Martin Johnson, had led the Lions tour, but Dallaglio was preferred. 2003 Rugby World Cup After another strong season in 2000‚Äì01, he was selected for his second Lions tour, but an injury in the last game of the domestic season, against Bath, meant he was doubtful for the trip to Australia. The Lions passed him fit but the knee gave way in a mid-week match, cutting short his tour and forcing him to undergo reconstructive surgery. Dallaglio was a key member of the 2003 England Grand Slam and World Cup-winning side, being the only player to play in every minute of England's World Cup campaign. With the World Cup win, he became one of the two players - the other being England scrum half Matt Dawson - to have won the World Cup in both the 15- and 7-a-side competitions. Dallaglio was re-appointed as captain after Martin Johnson retired. In August 2004, Dallaglio announced his retirement from the national team due to the brutal demands of international rugby but after being selected for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand he changed his mind and made himself available for international selection again. He regained the captaincy in 2004 after Johnson's retirement from international rugby, but without Johnson the team played poorly, and Dallaglio announced his retirement from international rugby on 31 August 2004. Despite his international retirement, Dallaglio was called up for his third Lions tour in 2005 but he fractured his ankle during the first tour match, against Bay of Plenty on 4 June, and did not play again during the tour. 2007 Rugby World Cup At the end of 2005, Dallaglio announced that he was making himself available again for England selection and he was included in the squad for the 2006 Six Nations Championship. He was named on the bench for England's opening match of the tournament against Wales on 4 February at Twickenham. He was a blood replacement for clubmate Joe Worsley after 13 minutes and on 64 minutes was a replacement for Martin Corry, touching down with a clinically executed charge from the back of the scrum on 70 minutes. He gained three more caps off the bench during the tournament, but did not play in the last game of the championship, when England lost 28‚Äì24 to Ireland. Dallaglio continued to play for England, especially in the number eight position, forming ‚Äì with Neil Back and Richard Hill ‚Äì the Hill, Back, Dallaglio back-row trio affectionately nicknamed the Holy Trinity. On 15 June 2007, Dallaglio was one of 47 players chosen by England coach Brian Ashton to attend a pre-World Cup training camp and he was later named in the 30-man World Cup squad, alongside Joe Worsley and Jason Robinson, who were also veterans of England's 2003 Rugby World Cup success. Dallaglio said \\"The fans can expect this England team to give absolutely everything and play with an enormous amount of passion and pride.\\" England started poorly in the tournament, with an unconvincing 28‚Äì10 victory over the United States and a 36‚Äì0 loss to eventual champions South Africa. Dallaglio started the first game at number eight, but was dropped for the South Africa match in favour of Nick Easter, who became first choice for the rest of the tournament. Following the loss to South Africa, England began to improve steadily and, against most expectations, reached the final, where they lost a closely fought game. The improvement in performance was credited to the influence of a number of senior players, including Dallaglio (who made a number of appearances off the bench) and Mike Catt. Soon after the World Cup tournament, Dallaglio and Catt each published an autobiography that was serialised in a major newspaper. Both players were highly critical of coach Brian Ashton's performance. Many commentators questioned the wisdom of making public criticisms so soon after the tournament and Dallaglio later issued a clarification and partial apology. Retirement On 3 January 2008, Dallaglio announced that he was retiring from international rugby with immediate effect and from domestic rugby at the end of the current season; he also stated that he would like to take up coaching in the future. At the end to his career, Wasps won the 2008 Premiership Final on 31 May 2008 in front of a capacity crowd of 81,600 at Twickenham, then a world rugby union record attendance for a club match. Drugs scandal On 24 May 1999 Dallaglio resigned as England's rugby union captain following allegations in the News of the World that he had used and been a dealer in hard drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy: the incidents were alleged to have taken place eight or nine years earlier, though the newspaper's front-page story made no mention of this. The newspaper also reported that Dallaglio had boasted about taking drugs at a party during the Lions tour to South Africa, in 1997. Dallaglio \\"categorically denied\\" the newspaper's claim that he had dealt in drugs and said he had been the victim of \\"an elaborate set-up\\". In response, News of the World editor Phil Hall said: \\"We stand by our story. Lawrence Dallaglio is damned in his own words and, frankly, we are amazed at his denial.\\" England coach Clive Woodward, who was one of a panel of senior RFU officials who met Dallaglio to investigate the matter, said he was \\"bitterly disappointed\\" for the player and his family but was confident he would be \\"proved innocent\\". The RFU undertook their own investigation to assess the veracity of the claims and Leicester lock and British & Irish Lions skipper Martin Johnson was appointed to replace Dallaglio as England captain. Dallaglio was later fined ¬£15,000 plus costs by the RFU for the incident. Post-retirement Dallaglio was an analyst for ITV's coverage of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. He co-commentated with Nick Mullins in the semi final between Australia and New Zealand. He followed this up with a similar role in 2015. Charitable work Dallaglio captained the Help for Heroes XV at a charity match in Twickenham. The side, which included former England Internationals Will Greenwood, Jason Robinson and former England Team Manager Martin Johnson, defeated the International XV led by former Wales captain Scott Gibbs. Dallaglio ended the match by kicking the final conversion, bringing the score to 29‚Äì10. In front of a 52,254-strong crowd at Twickenham the game raised funds approximately ¬£1.3 million for Help for Heroes. Following the success of his testimonial year, Dallaglio set himself the challenge of raising half a million pounds for charity, and with much help and support from colleagues, friends and family the total ended up being well over a million, which was contributed to various charitable causes. This led to many more requests, and Dallaglio wanted to effectively manage his charitable efforts in a more formalised way. Then following the death of 'his rock', his mother Eileen, to cancer in 2008 Lawrence set up Dallaglio RugbyWorks in 2009. When its inaugural event 8 Rocks 2009 raised over ¬£600,000, Dallaglio and all of those supporting him and the charity knew that this was the beginning of something big. Nearly five years on, the charity has expanded significantly and has made close to ¬£10 million in total. In 2011 Dallaglio wanted to redefine the focus of the charity, and so went about the task of creating a social inclusion programme that took into consideration his passion for rugby and its values. Dallaglio RugbyWorks is an intensive, long- term skills development programme based on rugby, through which the aim is to get teenagers who have been excluded from mainstream education into sustained education, employment or training. In summer 2008, he cycled 933 km across the Pyrenees as part of a team of 30 cyclists, raising ¬£435,000 for Bliss, the special care baby charity. Starting out in Biarritz and finishing in Banyuls, he was joined by former rugby union footballer Damian Hopley and ski expert Warren Smith. In February 2010, Dallaglio embarked on a gruelling cycle from Rome to Edinburgh during the RBS 6 Nations Championship to raise money for Sport Relief and Dallaglio RugbyWorks. The Dallaglio Cycle Slam took place over the course of a month, seeing a team, including former Arsenal FC and England football international Lee Dixon cycling through all of the RBS 6 Nations countries, taking in each of the international rugby stadia along the way. The aim was to raise ¬£1 million, net proceeds of which were split equally between Sport Relief and the newly formed Dallaglio RugbyWorks, whose beneficiaries include Cancer Research UK, DebRA, Leukaemia Research, Help for Heroes and the RPA Benevolent Fund. In 2012, Lawrence Dallaglio joined forces with former England cricketer Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff for the Dallaglio Flintoff Cycle Slam 2012. They were joined by former footballers Lee Dixon and Graeme Le Saux, and a number of other celebrities and members of the public in a bid to cycle from Olympia in Greece, covering 521 km to the Olympic stadium in Stratford, London. The Dallaglio Flintoff Cycle Slam 2012 raised over two million pounds for Cancer Research UK and Great Ormond Street Hospital via Dallaglio RugbyWorks and the AF Foundation with a portion of the money raised going to Virgin Unite, Virgin‚Äôs non-profit arm. In 2014, Dallaglio led the third Dallaglio Cycle Slam from Treviso in Italy cycling over 2,300 km to Twickenham Stadium. The challenge raised over ¬£650,000 for Dallaglio RugbyWorks and Teenage Cancer Trust. In 2016, Dallaglio was joined by 160 riders from San Sebastien to Andorra, Barcelona, Majorca and Ibiza, over 2,000 km. The event raised over ¬£1 million for Dallaglio RugbyWorks. In 2018, 300 devoted cyclists including rugby player Austin Healey, Andrew Ridgeley from Wham and actor John Hannah also participated in the Dallaglio Cycle Slam. Personal life Dallaglio married his long-time girlfriend, Alice, in 2005. They have two daughters, Ella and Josie, and a son, Enzo. Already a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours. He has also received an Honorary Doctorate from Buckinghamshire New University for services to sport. The Doctorate was conferred on 12 September 2008.

The company is the oldest fine leather luxury goods house in the world. History In 1829, a year before Belgium declared its independence, Charles Delvaux opened a travel goods workshop and store in Brussels, Belgium. In 1908, Delvaux filed its first patents for handbags.https://www.delvaux.com/en/since-1829 Delvaux is a warrant holder to the Court of Belgium. The house went into a gradual decline at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1933 an agricultural engineer with no experience in leather goods, Franz Schwennicke, took over the company from Edmond Delvaux, the last of the Delvaux family line. While keeping the manufacturing of travel goods, he progressively introduced a new concept for the time, the creation of seasonal collections, as is still done to this day. For the 1958 Brussels World Fair, Delvaux introduced the \\"Le Brillant\\" handbag, designed by Paule Goethals. The range-topping \\"Le Brillant\\", still produced today, marked the first time the brand would create a product displaying the brand logo, in this case a buckle in the shape of a \\"D\\" letter. When Franz Schwennicke died in 1970, his wife Solange succeeded him, focusing on strengthening the creativity and expanding internationally. A light holdall model, the \\"Le Pin\\" was introduced to meet the needs of the new generation of career women who were looking for larger handbags to carry their accessories and personal effects. In 1988, a second workshop opened to meet rising demand, this time in Bourg- Argental, France. At the end of the 80s, Fran√ßois Schwennicke, the eldest son of Franz and Solange, became Executive Chairman. In 1994, the headquarters were moved back to Brussels, this time to the former arsenal of the Belgian Army on Boulevard Louis Schmidt. L'Arsenal was designed by Henri van Dievoet, a Belgian architect strongly inspired by Art Nouveau. The 180th anniversary of Delvaux was celebrated in 2009 and that milestone became the title of a book by Judah Hettie and V√©ronique Pouillard and the title of an exhibition at the Fashion Museum of Antwerp. In 2011, the investment arm of the Fung Group, First Heritage Brands, took a majority stake in the company with the ambition to further grow it internationally. Products Delvaux creates two collections per year, Spring-Summer and Autumn-Winter. Each collection sees the introduction of new materials and new colors. The current major lines of women's bags: \\"Le Brillant\\" (designed in 1958), \\"Le Temp√™te\\" (1967), \\"Le Madame\\" (1977) and \\"Le Pin\\" (1972). Other designs include \\"Le Simplissime\\" (1969), \\"Le Givry\\" (1977), and \\"Le Louise\\" (1973). In 2014, a line of men's bags was added. In 2016, Delvaux launched \\"Le Mutin\\" (2016), inspired by \\"Le Chasseresse\\", a Delvaux design of 1962.http://wowozine.com/le-mutin-the- newest-functional-bag-from-delvaux/ In 2017, the Maison created the \\"Miniatures Belgitude\\" (2017), a collection of 7 miniature versions of \\"Le Brillant\\", each representing a symbol of Belgium, celebrating the origins of the house.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/womens-style/delvaux-celebrates- belgian-roots-les-miniatures-belgitude-mini/ In 2018, Delvaux introduced \\"Le Cool Box\\" (2018)http://www.elle.fr/Mode/Les-news-mode/L-instant-mode-les-sacs- Delvaux-s-offrent-un-pop-up-Cool-Box-Kitchen-au-Bon-Marche-3633794 and \\"Le D to D\\" (2018).https://www.instyle.com/fashion/delvaux-d-to-d-bag Delvaux also creates small leather goods, custom jewellery and scarves. Since 1938, each new model is entered into a Gold Book alongside its detailed description and the name of its designer. Boutiques Delvaux boutique in Brussels Delvaux operates about 10 stores in Belgium with its flagship boutique being \\"Le 27\\" at 27, Boulevard de Waterloo in Brussels, Belgium.https://www.delvaux.com/en/diary/number-27-the-new-delvaux-experience- in-brussels In 2014, Delvaux opened its first international flagship boutiques in Paris, Tokyo and London. In 2018 Delvaux opened a second boutique in London on Sloane Street, as well as its first boutique in Italy, in Milan. In January 2019 Delvaux also opened its first American flagship in New York City, on the fabled Fifth Avenue at the corner of 59th Street, on Manhattan‚Äôs elegant Upper East Side, overlooking Central Park.

MMfA was founded in 2004 by journalist and political activist David Brock as a counterweight to the conservative Media Research Center. It is known for its aggressive criticism of conservative journalists and media outlets, including its \\"War on Fox News.\\" Founding Media Matters for America was founded in May 2004 by David Brock, a former conservative journalist who became a liberal, and later a prominent Democratic party political operative. Brock said that he founded the organization to combat the conservative journalism sector that he had once been a part of, although some critics say he has simply adopted the tactics of his part for a new political side. Brock further explained his motives for starting the group, telling The New York Times, that \\"the central thrust of his group would be to closely monitor conservative commentators and journalists and, when they make erroneous or misleading claims, to point them out and set the record straight.\\" Brock said he founded the organization because conservative \\"monitoring groups have helped build the conservative media's influence, in part by making mainstream journalists toe a more conservative line by convincing them that they are liberally biased... The right wing in this country has dominated the debate over liberal bias. By dominating that debate, my belief is they've moved the media itself to the right and therefore they've moved American politics to the right. He added, \\"I wanted to create an institution to combat what they're doing.\\" Brock founded the group with help from the Center for American Progress. Initial donors included Leo Hindery, Susie Tompkins Buell, and James Hormel. Organization overview Research Media Matters analyzes American news sources including NBC, ABC, CBS, PBS, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, OAN, Breitbart, the Fox News channel, and conservative talk radio. Its techniques include content analysis, fact checking, monitoring, and comparison of quotes or presentations from media figures to primary documents such as Pentagon or Government Accountability Office reports.MMfA has used the Government Accountability Office in make fact-checking articles. For example, GMA, CNN, print media fail to challenge Bush's missile defense claim . Pentagon reports have been used to debunk claims of WMD claims, such as Hannity criticized media, Bush administration... , mediamatters.org, July 7, 2006. Retrieved January 16, 2015. Beginning in 2006, Media Matters for America has released a number of studies which documented that Democrats and progressives are outnumbered by Republicans and conservatives in terms of guest appearances on television news programs. On September 12, 2007, Media Matters released a comprehensive study of 1,377 U.S. newspapers and the 201 syndicated political columnists the papers carry on a regular basis. Media Matters said \\"in paper after paper, state after state, and region after region, conservative syndicated columnists get more space than their progressive counterparts.\\" John Diaz, editorial page editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, said by over-factoring conservative columns in smaller newspapers, Media Matters' study had overestimated how many conservative columns appeared in daily newspapers. Diaz said Media Matters had obscured the nuanced ideological positions of some columnists classified in the study as conservative. An annual feature on the Media Matters website is the title of \\"Misinformer of the Year\\", which is given to the journalist, commentator, or network that Media Matters contends was responsible for the most factual errors or claims. Recipients of this award have included: Bill O'Reilly, Chris Matthews, ABC, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin, Rupert Murdoch, Rush Limbaugh, CBS News, George Will, The Center for Medical Progress, the fake news ecosystem, and the alt-right. Funding MMfA began with the help of $2 million in donations. According to Byron York of the National Review, additional funding came from MoveOn.org and the New Democrat Network. In 2004, MMfA received the endorsement of the Democracy Alliance, a partnership of wealthy and politically active progressive donors. The Alliance itself does not fund endorsees, but many wealthy Alliance members acted on the endorsement and donated directly to MMfA.How Vast The Left Wing Conspiracy? . Hudson Institute, November 30, 2006. Media Matters has a policy of not comprehensively listing donors. In 2010, six years after the Democracy Alliance initially endorsed MMfA, financier George Soros ‚Äî a founding and continuing member of the Alliance ‚Äî announced that he was donating $1 million to MMfA. Soros said his concern over \\"recent evidence suggesting that the incendiary rhetoric of Fox News hosts may incite violence\\" had moved him to donate to MMfA. During a 2014 CNN interview, David Brock stated that Soros' contributions were \\"less than 10 percent\\" of Media Matters' budget.Transcript of David Brock on Soros contributions to Media Matters , CNN. Retrieved February 24, 2015. According to Politico, Brock's assertion was misleading: \\"Media Matters, however has received funding from or formed partnerships with several groups that Soros funds or has funded. These include the Tides Foundation, Democracy Alliance, Moveon.org and the Center for American Progress.‚Äù During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the group received between $1 million and $2 million in federally backed small business loans from Bank of America as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The organization stated it would help them retain 64 employees. Personnel John Podesta, the former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, provided office space for Media Matters early in its formation at the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank which Podesta established in 2002. Hillary Clinton advised Media Matters in its early stages out of a belief that progressives should follow conservatives in forming think tanks and advocacy groups to support their political goals. According to The New York Times, Media Matters \\"helped lay the groundwork\\" for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Media Matters has hired several of the best known political professionals who have worked for Democratic politicians and for other progressive groups. In 2004, National Review referred to MMfA staffers who had recently worked on the presidential campaigns of John Edwards and Wesley Clark, for Congressman Barney Frank, and for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Eric E. Burns served as MMFA's president until 2011. Burns was succeeded by Matt Butler, and then, in 2013, by Bradley Beychok. In late 2016, Angelo Carusone replaced Bradley Beychok as MMFA's president. Under Carusone, the organization's focus has shifted toward focusing on the alt-right, conspiracy theories, and fake news. In 2014, the staff of Media Matters voted to join the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Media Matters management had declined to recognize the union through a card check process, instead exercising its right to force a union election. Initiatives Established to \\"incubate a new generation of liberal pundits\\", the Progressive Talent Initiative trains potential pundits in media skills. David Brock established Media Matters Action Network to track conservative politicians and organizations. Organized as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit group, the Media Matters Action Network can lobby and engage in political campaign work. The New York Times reported that it was \\"set to take on an expanded role in the 2012 elections, including potentially running television ads\\". Brock established American Bridge 21st Century as a super PAC associated with Media Matters for America. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, and a former lieutenant governor of Maryland, chairs the board of directors of American Bridge. American Bridge is focused on opposition research. In 2009, Media Matters Action Network launched the Conservative Transparency website, aimed at tracking the funding of conservative activist organizations. Media Matters Action Network established the Political Correction project with the goal of holding conservative politicians and advocacy groups accountable. In December 2010, Media Matters Action Network started EqualityMatters.org, a site \\"in support of gay equality\\". At launch the site fully incorporated Media Matters's content on LGBT issues. Designed to provide talking points for liberal activists and politicians, Brock set up the Message Matters project. Media Matters runs the website DropFox.com and works to get advertisers to boycott Fox News. One target, Orbitz, initially referred to Media Matters' efforts as a \\"smear campaign\\", but agreed, on June 9, 2011, following a three- week campaign by prominent LGBT organizations, to \\"review the policies and process used to evaluate where advertising is placed\\". In 2015, the formal Equality Matters program was deactivated and merged with the LGBT Program within Media Matters. Criticism of conservative media Don Imus On April 4, 2007, Media Matters posted a video clip of Don Imus calling the Rutgers University women's basketball team members \\"nappy-headed hoes\\" and made their discovery known in Media Matters' daily e-mailing to hundreds of journalists. The next day, according to The Wall Street Journal, \\"top news outlets didn't mention the incident.\\" It was objections made to CBS Radio by the National Association of Black Journalists that led to an on-the-air apology from Imus. MSNBC, calling Imus's comments \\"racist\\" and \\"abhorrent,\\" suspended Imus' show, and within minutes, CBS suspended Imus's radio show. The Wall Street Journal said Imus's apology \\"seemed to make matters worse, with critics latching on to Mr. Imus's use of the phrase 'you people.'\\" Included among those dissatisfied with Imus's apology and suspension were the coach of the Rutgers team and a group of MSNBC African-American employees. After Procter & Gamble pulled advertising from all of MSNBC's daytime schedule, and other advertisers, including General Motors and American Express requested CBS to cancel any upcoming advertising they had bought for \\"Imus in the Morning\\", MSNBC and CBS dropped Imus's show. Rush Limbaugh \\"phony soldiers\\" In September 2007, Media Matters' reported radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh saying Iraq War veterans opposed to the war as \\"the phony soldiers.\\" Limbaugh later said he was speaking of only one soldier, Jesse MacBeth, who had falsely claimed to have been decorated for valor but had never seen combat. Limbaugh said he was the victim of a \\"smear\\" by Media Matters, which had taken out of context and selectively edited his comments. After Limbaugh published what he said was the entire transcript of phony soldiers discussion, Media Matters reported that over a minute and 30 seconds was omitted without \\"notation or ellipsis to indicate that there is, in fact, a break in the transcript.\\" Limbaugh told National Review that the gap between referring to \\"phony soldiers\\" and MacBeth was a delay because his staff printed out an ABC news story that reported on what it called \\"phony soldiers\\" and that his transcript and audio edits were \\"for space and relevance reasons, not to hide anything.\\" The Associated Press, CNN, and ABC reported on the controversy, as political satirist and fictional pundit Stephen Colbert lampooned Limbaugh and his defenders saying: \\"Hey, Media Matters, you want to end offensive speech? Then stop recording it for people who would be offended.\\" Bill O'Reilly Harlem restaurant In October 2007 television and radio host and commentator Bill O'Reilly said a Media Matters' headline declaring \\"O'Reilly surprised 'there was no difference' between Harlem restaurant and other New York restaurants\\" took out of context comments he made regarding a pleasant dinner he shared with Al Sharpton at a Harlem restaurant. O'Reilly said Media Matters misleadingly took comments spoken five minutes apart and presented them as one. In an appearance on NBC's Today with Matt Lauer, Media Matters senior fellow Paul Waldman said Media Matters had included \\"the full audio, the full transcript, nothing was taken out of context\\". Laura Schlessinger racial slur On August 12, 2010, Media Matters reported that radio host Laura Schlessinger said \\"nigger\\" eleven times during a discussion with an African- American woman, continuing to say it after the caller took offense at the word. Schlessinger told the woman she was too sensitive and that a double standard determined who could say the word. Schlessinger also said that those \\"hypersensitive\\" about color should not \\"marry outside of their race.\\" The caller had earlier in the discussion said her husband was white. Schlessinger apologized for the epithet the day after the broadcast. A joint statement of Media Matters and other organizations noted that although Schlessinger \\"attempted to apologize for using the epithet, the racist diatribe on Tuesday's show extends far beyond the use of a single word\\" and urged advertisers to boycott her show. After General Motors, OnStar, and Motel 6 pulled their advertising, Schlessinger said she would not renew her syndication contract set to expire December 2010. In January 2011 her show resumed on satellite radio. Schlessinger held Media Matters responsible for the boycott, which she called a typical tactic of the group to fulfill its \\"sole purpose of silencing people.\\" She said the boycotts' \\"threat of attack on my advertisers and stations\\" had violated her First Amendment free speech rights.\\"CNN's John Roberts* corrects Dr. Laura on inaccurate attack against Speaker Pelosi\\", mediamatters.org.

War on Fox In March 2010, MMfA declared a \\"War on Fox.\\" David Brock said MMfA would focus its efforts on Fox and select conservative websites in what Brock called an \\"all-out campaign of 'guerrilla warfare and sabotage.'\\" MMfA said the greater attention given to Fox was part of a campaign to educate the public about what it regarded as the distortions of conservative media, and the greater attention given to Fox was in line with its prominence. MMfA said its Drop Fox campaign for advertisers to boycott Fox was also part of the organisation's educational mission. MMfA said that changing Fox, not shutting it down, was its goal. In December 2013, the War on Fox was officially concluded, with MMfA Executive VP Angelo Carusone claiming the \\"War on Fox is over. And it's not just that it's over, but it was very successful. To a large extent, we won,\\" claiming to have \\"effectively discredited the network's desire to be seen as 'fair and balanced.'\\" Around that time, Glenn Beck had departed the network and Sean Hannity's time slot was moved from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m.Quote from MMfA Executive Vice President Angelo Carusone , The Huffington Post; December 13, 2013. Retrieved January 6, 2015. Tucker Carlson blog posts In March 2019, MMfA released audio recordings of Fox News host Tucker Carlson, in which he made remarks demeaning to women between 2006 and 2011 on the call-in show hosted by shock jock Bubba The Love Sponge. Among other comments, Carlson called rape shield laws \\"unfair\\", defended Mormon fundamentalist church leader Warren Jeffs, who had been charged of child sexual assault, and called women \\"extremely primitive\\". After Carlson's remarks had been widely reported, Carlson tweeted: \\"Media Matters caught me saying something naughty on a radio show more than a decade ago\\" and declined to apologize. The following day, MMfA released a second set of audio recordings in which Carlson referred to Iraqis as ‚Äúsemiliterate primitive monkeys‚Äù and said they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use toilet paper or forks.‚Äù Carlson also suggested that immigrants to the U.S. should be ‚Äúhot‚Äù or ‚Äúreally smart‚Äù and that white men ‚Äúcreated civilization.‚Äù The Daily Caller, which Carlson co-founded, responded by resurfacing blog posts made by MMfA's president Angelo Carusone. These blog posts included derogatory comments about transvestites, Jews, and people from Japan and Bangladesh. Carusone responded by saying that posts were supposed to be a \\"caricature of what a right wing blowhard would sound like if he was living my life\\" and apologized for the \\"gross\\" remarks. Erik Wemple, writing in The Washington Post, expressed scepticism at Carusone's parody explanation. Reception In 2008, columnist Jacques Steinberg of The New York Times quoted David Folkenflik of National Public Radio as telling him that although Media Matters looked \\"at every dangling participle, every dependent clause, every semicolon, every quotation\\" for the benefit of \\"a cause, a party, a candidate, that they may have some feelings for\\", they were still a useful source for leads, partly due to the \\"breadth of their research.\\" Steinberg further explained: \\"Ripping a page from an old Republican Party playbook, Media Matters has given the Democrats a weapon they have not had in previous campaigns: a rapid-fire, technologically sophisticated means to call out what it considers ‚Äúconservative misinformation‚Äù on air or in print, then feed it to a Rolodex of reporters, cable channels and bloggers hungry for grist.\\" Conversely, political analyst and columnist Stuart Rothenberg told Steinberg that he did not pay attention to them, as he had no confidence in \\"ideological stuff.\\" In Steinberg's view, Media Matters is a new weapon for the Democratic Party employing \\"rapid-fire, technologically sophisticated means to call out what it considers 'conservative misinformation' on air or in print, then feed it to a Rolodex of reporters, cable channels and bloggers hungry for grist.\\" According to a 2010 opinion piece by \\"M. S.\\" on the blog of The Economist magazine, \\"because it is dedicated to critiquing distortions by conservatives, its critiques carry no weight with conservatives.\\" Some news organizations have cited Media Matters reports and credited it for bringing attention to issues including the story of James Guckert, formerly a reporter for the web-based Talon News. During George W. Bush's administration, Guckert gained White House press access using the pseudonym Jeff Gannon and attended 155 White House press briefings. It was revealed that he had also worked as a prostitute soliciting male clientele on the Internet with photos of himself fully naked. Leftist columnists and writers such as Paul Krugman and the late Molly Ivins cited Media Matters or identified it as a helpful source. In 2015, Emma Roller in The Atlantic described MMFA as part of Brock's \\"three-pronged empire\\", along with the super PACs American Bridge 21st Century and Correct the Record. Roller wrote that the \\"ferocity with which Media Matters has defended Clinton can verge on the absurd.\\" After Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election, Clio Chang and Alex Shephard wrote in The New Republic that \\"in our numerous conversations with past Media Matters staff, there was a consensus that in the lead-up to Clinton‚Äôs announcement of her candidacy in 2015, the organization‚Äôs priority shifted away from [its stated mission] towards running defense for Clinton\\" which \\"damaged Media Matters‚Äôs credibility and hurt its work in other areas that had previously been strongly respected.\\" They accused MMfA of lowering its research standards in defense of Hillary Clinton, writing \\"The organization had long ceased to be a mere watchdog, having positioned itself at the center of a group of public relations and advocacy outfits whose mission was to help put [Hillary] Clinton in the White House,\\" the magazine concluded. Media Matters has been criticized by Daily Wire Editor and Co- founder Ben Shapiro, who accused it of targeting those with opposing political views with boycotts. Tax-exempt status challenge C. Boyden Gray, former White House counsel for George H. W. Bush and Fox consultant, sent a letter to the IRS in 2011 alleging that MMfA's activities including the War on Fox were not primarily educational, but instead \\"unlawful conduct\\" and asking for that MMfA's tax-exempt status to be revoked. Prior to Gray's IRS petition, Politico reported that Fox News had run \\"more than 30 segments calling for the nonprofit group to be stripped of its tax-exempt status.\\" In another report, Politico said Fox News and Fox Business campaigns held, \\"The non-profit status as an educator is violated by partisan attacks. That sentiment was first laid out by a piece written by Gray for The Washington Times in June.\\" In an interview with Fox News, Gray said \\"It's not unlawful. It's just not charitable.\\" MMfA vice-president Ari Rabin-Havt said \\"C. Boyden Gray is [a] Koch-affiliated, former Fox News contributor whose flights of fancy have already been discredited by actual experts in tax law.\\" Gray denied having been on Fox's payroll while he was a Fox consultant in 2005, but at that time, Fox had said Gray was a contributor, adding: \\"We pay contributors for strong opinions.\\" Marcus Owens, former director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations Division, told Politico in 2011 that he believed the law was on Media Matters's side. Owens told Fox Business that only an IRS probe could reveal if partisan activity takes up a substantial enough part of MMfA's operations to disallow its tax-free status; the IRS allows limited political activity at nonprofits if it does not take up a substantial amount of their operations.

It was affiliated to the Berks & Bucks Football Association. The club previously played in the Combined Counties Football League, but with the agreement of the leagues involved, swapped places with Badshot Lea in time for the start of the 2008‚Äì09 season. History The club was formed in 1966 as Lower Burghfield and started life in the Reading Combination League. In the early 1980s they were the Premier Division Champions on four occasions, with the 1983‚Äì84 season seeing them not just win the league, but three league cup competitions too. The next season saw them move to the Reading & District League where they finished as runners-up in the Premier Division and went on to win the Reading Senior Cup. The 1985‚Äì86 season saw them once again finish as runners-up in the Premier Division, but this time around they had to settle for runners-up in the Reading Senior Cup. During their time in the Reading leagues the club changed its name several times, being known as XL United, Vincents United and finally Reading Garage. In 1989‚Äì90 they joined the Premier Division of the Chiltonian League, and changed their name from Reading Garage to I T S Reading. In 1993‚Äì94 they changed their name to Reading Town and relocated to their final home of Scours Lane. The 1994‚Äì95 season saw the team win the Premier Division Championship, and gain promotion to the Combined Counties Football League. Their first season in the Combined counties league the club finished midtable but went on to win the Berks & Bucks FA Senior Trophy, beating Lambourn Sports in the final. Floodlights were installed the following season and the team reached the final of the Berks & Bucks FA Senior Trophy again, but were beaten in final by Abingdon Town. That season also saw the club enter the FA Vase for the first time, where they reached the 4th Round, before succumbing to beaten semi-finalists Banstead Athletic. The 1997‚Äì98 campaign saw the club finish as runners-up in the league, losing out to Ashford Town. That season also saw them enter the FA Cup for the first time in their history, entering at the preliminary qualification round, where they were knocked out by Waterlooville. At the start of 2001‚Äì02 season Town appointed former Manchester United and England star Neil Webb as Manager. However Webb was unable to transfer his success as a player to the management role and after a poor start to the season he resigned in November. Twenty- three-year-old Colin Millard was made the manager for the 2002‚Äì03 campaign Town, and stayed with the club until the end of the 2006‚Äì07 to become Assistant manager at Bracknell Town. The club then appointed Neil Goff and Glenn Goudie as joint managers of the club for the 2007‚Äì08 season. Goff was the former assistant manager of Reading Town when Millard was in charge; Goudie's previous role at the club was the goalkeeping and defensive coach, he was also the former manager of Royal Mail FC in the Reading Football League. In September 2007 Millard resigned as Assistant Manager at Bracknell Town and was re-appointed as Manager, with Goudie and Goff reverting to the position of Joint Assistant Managers. In June 2008 Reading Town moved across leagues to join the Premier Division of the Hellenic Football League. The first season in the new league saw the club finish eighth, and win the Berks & Bucks Senior Trophy again, when they beat Newport Pagnell Town in the final 2‚Äì0. The next season saw the club become runners-up of the Hellenic League Floodlit Cup and the Berks & Bucks Senior Trophy, but gained some consolation by winning the Southern Combination Cup for the first time. At the end of season Colin Millard resigned and was replaced by former Henley Town boss Roddy Slater. Roddy's stint in charge lasted only one season and he resigned at the end of 2010‚Äì11 to be succeeded by Mark Bartley. Under Mark Bartley the club went on to win the Hellenic League Supplementary cup, beating Highmoor Ibis 4‚Äì3 in the final. At the end of the season Bartley resigned due to not wanting to work on a smaller budget for the following season. Michael Butcher was appointed as Bartleys replacement but only lasted till January 2013 when he quit as manager and former manager Colin Millard took over. In June 2013 Millard's appointment was made permanent. In February 2016, Reading Town were closed down by owners Battersea and Wandsworth TUC. Stadium Scours Lane Reading Town played their home games at Scours Lane Stadium, in the Tilehurst area of the town. The stadium has a capacity of 2,000, of which 162 is covered seating. The record attendance for a Reading Town game is 1,067 against AFC Wimbledon at Scours Lane on 3 May 2003. Scours Lane is the second-highest capacity football stadium in Reading, next to Madejski Stadium, home of Sky Bet Championship side Reading. The ground is now used by Reading City F.C.

Beginning in the second half of the 1880s, he published articles in various fields (hydrology, architecture, physics, political history, and philosophy) displaying the influence of Aristotle, as well as Hippolyte Taine and Ernest Renan. In 1893, he publicly affirmed his position as a Marxist and a socialist. His social and political philosophy owed much to his reading of Proudhon, Karl Marx, Giambattista Vico, Henri BergsonLovejoy, Arthur O.

(whose lectures at the Coll√®ge de France he attended), and later William James. Sorel's engagement in the political world was accompanied by a correspondence with Benedetto Croce, and later with Vilfredo Pareto. Sorel worked on the first French Marxist journals, L‚Äô√àre nouvelle and Le Devenir social, and then participated at the turn of the century in the revisionist debate and crisis within Marxism. He took the side of Eduard Bernstein against Orthodox Marxist Karl Kautsky. Sorel supported acquittal during the Dreyfus affair, although, like his friend Charles P√©guy, he later felt betrayed by what he saw as the opportunism of the Dreyfusards. Through his contributions to Enrico Leone's Il Divenire sociale and Hubert Lagardelle's Mouvement socialiste, he contributed around 1905 to the theoretical elaboration of revolutionary syndicalism.Neilson, Francis (1919). \\"Georges Sorel and Syndicalism.\\" In: The Old Freedom. New York: B. W. Huebsch, pp. 78‚Äì94. In 1906, his most famous text, Reflections on Violence, appeared in this last journal. It was published in book form in 1908, and was followed the same year by Illusions du Progr√®s. Disappointed by the Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail (CGT), Sorel associated himself for a period in 1909‚Äì1910 with Charles Maurras‚Äô Action fran√ßaise, while sharing neither its nationalism nor its political program. This collaboration inspired the founders of the Cercle Proudhon, which brought together revolutionary syndicalists and monarchists. Sorel himself, with Jean Variot, founded a journal in 1911 called L'Ind√©pendance, although disagreements, in part over nationalism, soon ended the project. Roman, Thomas (2001). \\"L'Independance. Une Revue Traditionaliste\\", Mil-neuf-cent. No. 20. Ferociously opposed to the 1914 Union sacr√©e political truce, Sorel denounced the war and in 1917 praised the Russian Revolution, which was later printed in an official Soviet Union publication, Russian Soviet Government Bureau, calling Lenin \\"the greatest theoretician of socialism since Marx and a statesman whose genius recalls that of Peter the Great.\\"Georges Sorel, \\"For Lenin,\\" Soviet Russia, Official Organ of The Russian Soviet Government Bureau, Vol. II, New York: NY, January‚ÄìJune 1920 (10 April 1920) p. 356 He wrote numerous small pieces for Italian newspapers defending the Bolsheviks. Less than one year later in March 1921, Sorel turned his praise towards a rising fascist leader in Italy, writing that \\"Mussolini is a man no less extraordinary than Lenin. He, too, is a political genius, of a greater reach than all the statesmen of the day, with the only exception of Lenin‚Ä¶\\"Jacob L. Talmon, The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution: The Origins of Ideological Polarization in the 20th Century, University of California Press (1981) p. 451. Sorel‚Äôs March 1921 conversations with Jean Variot, published in Variot‚Äôs Propos de Georges Sorel, (1935) Paris, pp. 53-57, 66-86 passim Sorel was extremely hostile to Gabriele D‚ÄôAnnunzio, the poet who attempted to re- conquer Fiume for Italy, and did not show sympathy for the rise of fascism in Italy, despite Jean Variot's later claims that he placed all his hopes in Benito Mussolini. After the war, Sorel published a collection of his writings entitled Mat√©riaux d‚Äôune Th√©orie du Prol√©tariat. At the time of his death, in Boulogne sur Seine, he had an ambivalent attitude towards both fascism and Bolshevism. Although his writing touched on many subjects, Sorel's work is best characterized by his original interpretation of Marxism, which was deeply anti-determinist, politically anti-elitist, anti-Jacobin,\\"One can say that optimists are, in general, extremist theoreticians. The consequences of this have been well put by Georges Sorel in writing of the Jacobins: 'If, unfortunately, they find themselves armed with great political power allowing them to realize an ideal that they have conceived, optimists may lead their country to worse catastrophes. They are not long in recognizing, indeed, that social transformations are not achieved with the facility they had expected; they attribute their disappointments to their contemporaries, rather than explain the march of events in terms of historic necessity; thus they end by attempting to remove those people whose evil desires seem to them dangerous to the welfare of mankind. During the Terror, the men who spilt most blood were exactly those who had the keenest desire to enable their fellow-creatures to enjoy the golden age of which they had dreamed, and who had the strongest sympathy for human misery. Optimistic, idealistic, and sensitive, as they were, these men showed themselves the more inexorable as they had a greater thirst for universal well-being'.\\" ‚Äì Michels, Robert (1949). \\"The Sociological Character of Political Parties.\\" In: First Lectures in Political Sociology. University of Minnesota Press, p. 140. and built on the direct action of unions, the mobilizing role of myth‚Äîespecially that of the general strike‚Äîand on the disruptive and regenerative role of violence. Whether Sorel is better seen as a left-wing or right-wing thinker is disputed:Wilde, Larry (1986). \\"Sorel and the French Right,\\" History of Political Thought, Vol. VII, pp. 361-74.Schecter, Darrow (1990). \\"Two Views of Revolution: Gramsci and Sorel,\\" History of European Ideas, Vol. XII, pp. 637-53. the Italian Fascists praised him as a forefather, but the dictatorial government they established ran contrary to his beliefs, while he was also an important touchstone for Italy's first communists, who saw Sorel as a theorist of the proletariat. Such widely divergent interpretations arise from the theory that a moral revival of the country must take place to re-establish itself, saving it from decadence;\\"Sorel saw only a decadent world of self-serving interest groups, self-indulgent intellectuals, and venal leaders rationalizing their lack of all conviction into pacifistic principles. The English were scorned for treating wars like athletic contests; the French, for succumbing to an arid rationalism easily co-opted by the Third Republic. He rejected the Enlightenment heritage traditionally honored by French revolutionaries, and the 'illusions of progress' that had led the French to worship the state, and workers to engage in demeaning political activity.\\" ‚Äì Billington, James H.

Political writings \\"Sorel began his writing as a marginal Marxist, a critical analyst of Marx's economics and philosophy, and not a pious commentator. He then embraced revisionism, became for several years the 'metaphysician of syndicalism', as Jaur√®s called him, flirted ardently with royalist circles, and then reverted to his commitment to the proletariat.

The turmoil engendered by strikes was universally condemned even by parliamentary socialists, who favored negotiation and conciliation. To justify the militancy and to give syndicalism an ideology, Sorel published the series of articles that became, as one of his biographers calls it, 'a famous and infamous book.'\\"Meisel, James H. (1951). The Genesis of Georges Sorel. Ann Arbor, Michigan: The George Wahr Publishing Company, p. 125. Indeed, it was Sorel's only successful book of about a dozen published,Hale (1971), p. 109. which cemented his legacy by 1912 as \\"the leading figure amongst the French Syndicalists.\\"James Ramsay McDonald, Syndicalism: A Critical Examination, London, UK, Constable & Co., 1912, p. 7 This book was published in Italian, Spanish, German, Japanese and English. Two of its themes have become a part of social science literature: the concept of the social myth and the virtue of violence. To Sorel the Syndicalist's general strike, the Marxist's catastrophic revolution, the Christian's church militant, the legends of the French Revolution, and the remembrance of June Days are all myths that move people, quite independent of their historical reality. As one of Sorel's disciples (Benito Mussolini)\\"Young Benito Mussolini became a Socialist and in 1908, at the age of 25, went to Trento as a journalist, and worked for a little with the Socialist irredentist leader, Cesare Battisti; he was soon expelled by the Austrian authorities and it is not uninteresting that the Florentine Voce published an article he then wrote on the Trentino. It is sometimes said that Mussolini's visit to Trento brought Nietzsche into his life, though he had certainly been influenced by him earlier; his journalistic efforts showed the influence, above all, of Georges Sorel, and his behaviour that of Sorel's friend, Pareto.\\" ‚Äì Wiskemann, Elizabeth (1947). \\"The Origins of Fascism.\\" In: Italy. Oxford University Press, p. 54.Gregor, A. James (1979). Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism. University of California Press said, men do not move mountains; it is only necessary to create the illusion that mountains move. Social myths, says Sorel, are not descriptions of things, but \\"expressions of a determination to act.\\"Hale (1971), p. 109. Myths enclose all the strongest inclinations of a people, of a party, or of a class, and the general strike is \\"the myth in which Socialism is wholly comprised.\\"Reflections on Violence, Free Press, 1950, p. 145. For Sorel the general strike was a catastrophic conception of socialism, the essence of the class struggle, and the only true Marxist means of effecting the revolution. Nowhere does Sorel endorse indiscriminate, brutal violence; only violence \\"enlightened by the idea of the general strike\\"Reflections on Violence, p. 278. is unconditionally defended. Only violence in the Marxist class war, as Sorel conceived it, is fine and heroic and in the service of the \\"immemorial interest of civilization.\\"Reflections on Violence, p. 113. In fact, Sorel makes no justification of violence by philosophical argument, but uses long excursions into history and current events to suggest that ethical codes are relative to their time and place. Consistent with his position he could describe the Declaration of the Rights of Man as \\"only a colorless collection of abstract and confused formulas, without any practical bearing.\\"Reflections on Violence, p. 235. Relation to Marxism Sorel had been politically monarchist and traditionalist before embracing orthodox Marxism in the 1890s. He attempted to fill in what he believed were gaps in Marxist theory, resulting in an extremely heterodox and idiosyncratic view of Marxism. For instance, Sorel saw pessimism and irrationalism at the core of Marxism and rejected Karl Marx's own rationalism and \\"utopian\\" tendency. Sorel also saw Marxism as closer in spirit to early Christianity than to the French Revolution. He did not view Marxism as \\"true\\" in a scientific sense, as orthodox Marxists did, but believed Marxism's \\"truth\\" lay in its promise of a morally redemptive role for the proletariat, within a terminally decadent society. Sorel's was a voluntarist Marxism: he rejected those Marxists who believed in inevitable and evolutionary change, emphasizing instead the importance of will and preferring direct action. These approaches included general strikes, boycotts, and constant disruption of capitalism with the goal being to achieve worker control over the means of production. Sorel's belief in the need for a deliberately conceived \\"myth\\" to sway crowds into concerted action was put into practice by mass fascist movements in the 1920s. The epistemic status of the idea of \\"myth\\" is of some importance, and is essentially that of a working hypothesis, with one fundamental peculiarity: it is a hypothesis which we do not judge by its closeness to a \\"Truth\\", but by the practical consequences which stem from it. Thus, whether a political myth is of some importance or not must be decided, in Sorel's view, on the basis of its capacity to mobilize human beings into political action;Marcu, Valeriu (1931). \\"Mythology of Dictatorship (Georges Sorel).\\" In: Men and Fources of Our Time. New York: The Viking Press, pp. 229‚Äì244. the only possible way for men to ascend to an ethical life filled by the character of the sublime and to achieve deliverance. Sorel believed the \\"energizing myth\\"Roberts, David D. (2006). The Totalitarian Experiment in Twentieth-century Europe: Understanding the Poverty of Great Politics.

Georges Sorel and the 'Myth' of the General Strike.\\" In: The Pragmatic Revolt in Politics; Syndicalism, Fascism, and the Constitutional State. New York: The Macmillan Company. The \\"myth\\" that the fascists would appeal to, however, was that of the race, nation, or people, as represented by the state. Historian Zeev Sternhell frequently mentions Sorelin Ni Droite, ni gauche (Neither Right nor Left), a book originally published in 1983 as one of the men who led the way to the fusion of the left-wing revisionists and of the right-wing ultranationalists into what later became fascism. Sorel's vision of socialism was \\"a-Marxist, anti-Marxist, eventually post-Marxist revisionist\\".Ni droite ni gauche, l'id√©ologie fasciste en France, Zeev Sternhell, p. 196, French edition Folio Histoire 2012 Sternhell says that \\"the socialism designed as 'ethical socialism' by Sorel, Robert Michels and Arturo Labriola [...] will play a huge role in the evolution of the socialist nationalist synthesis, in the eve of 1914 and in the Interwar\\".Ni droite ni gauche, p. 192 Anti-capitalism In his most famous work Reflections on Violence (1908), Sorel warned about the political trend that conservatives and parliamentary socialists could become allies in the struggle against capitalism.\\"There is only one thing which may indeed retard this rapid course toward the unknown, to the 'mythic' Social Revolution. This is readiness on the part of the 'middle classes' to yield and to make peace, combined with readiness to negotiate on the part of the 'working class aristocracy,‚Äô their acknowledged leaders. This is the only issue that Georges Sorel is particularly afraid of, as it is likely to soften the warlike spirit of the working class, and thus to postpone their victory in the struggle.\\" ‚Äì Miliukov, Paul (1920). Bolshevism: An International Danger. London: George Allen & Unwin, pp. 24-25. Sorel's view is that the conservatives and parliamentary socialism had common goals, both conceiving of the nation as a centrally controlled, organic unit. Also, the parliamentarian socialism of the left wants economic nationalism, and huge tariff-barriers in order to protect their interior capitalists and this meshes with the cultural nationalism of the conservatives. Sorel warned about the creation of corporatism, where the workers movements and the employers organizations would merge, thus ending the class-struggle; because he felt that parliamentary democracy was moving in that direction at the beginning of the 19th century, Sorel said that the workers should stay away from the socialist parties, and use strikes and violence instead as their primary weapons against the middle and upper classes in parliament. That way, the workers would not only fight harder for their share of the values produced by capitalism, but also avoid the semi-feudal, corporative dystopia and oligarchy that the socialists and the conservatives were, supposedly, working towards. Thoughts on economics and parliamentary democracy In his Reflections on Violence, Sorel says that parliamentary socialism, and its middle-class of bureaucrats and newspaper-intellectuals does not understand social science, economics, or any other matter important for good rule as well as the traditional liberal and capitalist elite that ruled before the mediocre middle-class became a powerful force in parliament. \\"How did these mediocre and silly people become so powerful?\\" Sorel asks. His theory on this is that the mediocre middle-class became powerful when the working-classes, people without property, were given the right to vote at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century. Thus, the working classes now created a problem for themselves by creating a political elite that is more stupid and less competent than the people who had a monopoly of power before them. He proposed that this problem could be fixed only by a collective withdrawal and boycott of the parliamentary system by the workers. Thus, the workers must return to strikes and violence as their main political tool, so Sorel says. This gives the workers a sense of unity, a return to dignity, and weakens the dangerous and mediocre middle-class in their struggle for power, and their attack on capitalism. Anti-elitism Sorel rejected political elitismDaniel Woodley, Fascism and Political Theory: Critical Perspectives on Fascist Ideology, Routledge, 2010, p. 125. because the middle-classes tend to co-opt all organizational hierarchies, and turn them into gentlemen's clubs for people who like to talk theory and write long newspaper articles. This point was made by Sorel in Reflections on Violence, and was later developed further by Robert Michels and his Iron Law of Oligarchy.Michels, Robert (1915). \\"Democracy and the Iron Law of Oligarchy.\\" In: Political Parties. New York: Hearst's International Library Co., pp. 377‚Äì392. Sorel's antirealism Isaiah Berlin identifies three anti-scientific currents in Sorel's work,Berlin, Sir Isaiah (1997). Against The Current: Essays in the History of Ideas. London: Pimlico. but Sorel's attack on science is neither general nor piecemeal. Rather than \\"attacks\\", as is clear from the quotations below, Sorel explains how we should view \\"science\\" in relation to what he called \\"the real thing\\". Science is not reality He dismissed science as \\"a system of idealised entities: atoms, electric charges, mass, energy and the like ‚Äì fictions compounded out of observed uniformities... deliberately adapted to mathematical treatment that enable men to identify some of the furniture of the universe, and to predict and... control parts of it.\\" [1; 301] He regarded science more as \\"an achievement of the creative imagination, not an accurate reproduction of the structure of reality, not a map, still less a picture, of what there was. Outside of this set of formulas, of imaginary entities and mathematical relationships in terms of which the system was constructed, there was 'natural' nature ‚Äì the real thing‚Ä¶\\" [1; 302] He regarded such a view as \\"an odious insult to human dignity, a mockery of the proper ends of men\\", [1; 300] and ultimately constructed by \\"fanatical pedants\\", [1; 303] out of \\"abstractions into which men escape to avoid facing the chaos of reality.\\" [1; 302] Science is not nature As far as Sorel was concerned, \\"nature is not a perfect machine, nor an exquisite organism, nor a rational system.\\" [1; 302] He rejected the view that \\"the methods of natural science can explain and explain away ideas and values‚Ä¶or explain human conduct in mechanistic or biological terms, as the‚Ä¶blinkered adherents of la petite science believe.\\" [1; 310] He also maintained that the categories we impose upon the world, \\"alter what we call reality‚Ä¶they do not establish timeless truths as the positivists maintained\\", [1; 302] and to \\"confuse our own constructions with eternal laws or divine decrees is one of the most fatal delusions of men.\\" [1; 303] It is \\"ideological patter... bureaucracy, la petite science... the Tree of Knowledge has killed the Tree of Life... human life [has been reduced] to rules that seem to be based on objective truths.\\" [1; 303] Such to Sorel, is the appalling arrogance of science, a vast deceit of the imagination, a view that conspires to \\"stifle the sense of common humanity and destroy human dignity.\\" [1; 304] Science is not a recipe Science, he maintained, \\"is not a 'mill' into which you can drop any problem facing you, and which yields solutions\\", [1; 311] that are automatically true and authentic. Yet, he claimed, this is precisely how too many people seem to regard it. To Sorel, that is way \\"too much of a conceptual, ideological construction\\", [1; 312] smothering our perception of truth through the \\"stifling oppression of remorselessly tidy rational organisation.\\" [1; 321] For Sorel, the inevitable \\"consequence of the modern scientific movement and the application of scientific categories and methods to the behaviour of men\\", [1; 323] is an outburst of interest in irrational forces, religions, social unrest, criminality and deviance - resulting directly from an overzealous and monistic obsession with scientific rationalism. And what science confers, \\"a moral grandeur, bureaucratic organisation of human lives in the light of‚Ä¶la petite science, positivist application of quasi-scientific rules to society ‚Äì all this Sorel despised and hated\\", [1; 328] as so much self-delusion and nonsense that generates no good and nothing of lasting value.

In humans, it measures 9 cm2 (3 centimetres by 3 centimetres) and lies on the roof of the nasal cavity about 7 cm above and behind the nostrils. The olfactory epithelium is the part of the olfactory system directly responsible for detecting odors. Structure Olfactory epithelium consists of four distinct cell types:Ross, MH, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 5th Edition. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2006. page 615-616. * Olfactory sensory neurons * Supporting cells * Basal cells * Brush cells Olfactory sensory neurons The olfactory receptor neurons are sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium. They are bipolar neurons and their apical poles express odorant receptors on non-motile cilia at the ends of the dendritic knob, which extend out into the airspace to interact with odorants. Odorant receptors bind odorants in the airspace, which are made soluble by the serous secretions from olfactory glands located in the lamina propria of the mucosa.Ross, MH, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 5th Edition. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2006. page 616. The axons of the olfactory sensory neurons congregate to form the olfactory nerve (CN I). Once the axons pass through the cribriform plate, they terminate and synapse with the dendrites of mitral cells in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. Supporting cells Analogous to neural glial cells, the supporting cells are non-neural cells in the olfactory epithelium that are located in the apical layer of the pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium. There are two types of supporting cells in the olfactory epithelium: sustentacular cells and microvillar cells. The sustentacular cells function as metabolic and physical support for the olfactory epithelium. Microvillar cells are another class of supporting cells that are morphologically and biochemically distinct from the sustentacular cells, and arise from a basal cell population that expresses the c-KIT cell surface protein. Basal cells Resting on or near the basal lamina of the olfactory epithelium, basal cells are stem cells capable of division and differentiation into either supporting or olfactory cells. While some of these basal cells divide rapidly, a significant proportion remain relatively quiescent and replenish olfactory epithelial cells as needed. This leads to the olfactory epithelium being replaced every 6‚Äì8 weeks. Basal cells can be divided on the basis of their cellular and histological features into two populations: the horizontal basal cells, which are slowly dividing reserve cells that express p63; and globose basal cells, which are a heterogeneous population of cells consisting of reserve cells, amplifying progenitor cells, and immediate precursor cells. Brush cells A brush cell is a microvilli-bearing columnar cell with its basal surface in contact with afferent nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) and is specialized for transduction of general sensation. Olfactory (Bowman's) glands Tubuloalveolar serous secreting glands lying in the lamina propria of the olfactory mucosa. These glands deliver a proteinaceous secretion via ducts onto the surface of the mucosa. The role of the secretions are to trap and dissolve odiferous substances for the bipolar neurons. Constant flow from the olfactory glands allows old odors to be constantly washed away. Development A schematic drawing of the components of the embryonic olfactory epithelium. ORN = olfactory receptor neuron, OEC = olfactory ensheathing cell The olfactory epithelium derives from two structures during embryonic development: the olfactory placode, which was long believed to be its sole origin; and neural crest cells, whose contributions have been identified more recently through fate mapping studies. The embryonic olfactory epithelium consists of fewer cell types than in the adult, including apical and basal progenitor cells, as well as immature olfactory sensory neurons. Early embryonic neurogenesis relies mostly on the apical cells, while later stage embryonic neurogenesis and secondary neurogenesis in adults relies on basal stem cells. The axons of the immature olfactory sensory neurons, along with a mixed population of migratory cells, including immature olfactory ensheathing cells and gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons form a ‚Äúmigratory mass‚Äù that travels towards the olfactory bulb. At the end of the embryonic stage, the epithelium develops into a pseudostratified columnar epithelium and begins secondary neurogenesis.  Olfactory placode  Embryonic morphogen signaling on olfactory placode and neural crest cells contributes to formation of neurogenic and non-neurogenic tissue of the olfactory epithelium.Placodes are transient, focal aggregations of ectoderm located in the developmental region of the future vertebrate head, and give rise to sensory organs. Early cranial sensory placodes are marked by expression of Six1, part of the Six family of transcription factors that regulate preplacodal ectoderm specification. The olfactory placode forms as two thickenings of non-neural region of embryonic ectoderm. In mice, the olfactory placode derives from an anterior portion of the neural tube, ~9-9.5 days into development and not long after the closure of the neural plate. Development of the olfactory placode requires the presence underlying neural crest-derived mesenchymal tissue. The specification of the olfactory placode tissue involves signaling of multiple gene networks, beginning with signals from bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), retinoic acid (RA), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), specifically FGF8. The resulting regulated downstream expression of transcription factors, such as Pax6, Dlx3, Sox2, and others, within the presumptive olfactory placode are crucial for sub-regionalization within the future olfactory epithelium and is responsible for the diversity of cells that compose the future epithelium. Similar to the other embryonic placodes, the olfactory placode gives rise to both neural and non-neural structures, ultimately resulting in the formation of the nasal epithelium. The specification of neural versus non-neural tissue involves signals both within the olfactory placode, and between the olfactory placode and the underlying mesenchymal compartment. Continued signaling by BMP, FGF, and RA, the morphogens that initially induced placode formation, collectively coordinate the patterning of olfactory placode tissue into the future distinct cell types that make up the olfactory epithelium. The cell types derived from the olfactory placode include: * Neural: olfactory sensory neurons, LHRH-secreting neurons, and ganglion cells * Non-neuronal: basal cells, olfactory supporting cells, ciliated cells, Bowman‚Äôs glands, Schwann cells, submucosal glands, and brush cells However, there is significant evidence for an additional neural crest-origin for many of these cell types as well.  Olfactory sensory neuron development  Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) express odorant receptors. The axons of OSNs expressing the same odorant receptors converge onto the same glomerulus at the olfactory bulb, allowing for the organization of olfactory information.Olfaction results from the proper development and interaction of the two components of the primary olfactory pathway: the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. The olfactory epithelium contains olfactory sensory neurons, whose axons innervate the olfactory bulb. In order for olfactory sensory neurons to function properly, they must express odorant receptors and the proper transduction proteins on non-motile cilia that extend from the dendritic knob in addition to projecting their axons to the olfactory bulb. The cells of the olfactory epithelium, including olfactory sensory neurons, begin to differentiate soon after the induction of the olfactory placode. Once the olfactory sensory neurons differentiate, they express odorant receptors, which transduce odorant information from the environment to the central nervous system and aids in the development of the odorant map. The differentiated olfactory sensory neurons extend pioneering axons, which follow guidance cues released by the underlying mesenchyme, as well as other chemotrophic cues released from the telencephalon. As development of the olfactory pathway progresses, more axons innervate the olfactory bulb, which develops from the rostral-most region of telencephalon. The organization and subsequent processing of odorant information is possible due to the convergence of olfactory sensory neuron axons expressing the same odorant receptors onto the same glomerulus at the olfactory bulb.  Clinical significance The olfactory epithelium can be damaged by inhalation of toxic fumes, physical injury to the interior of the nose, and possibly by the use of some nasal sprays. Because of its regenerative capacity, damage to the olfactory epithelium can be temporary but in extreme cases, injury can be permanent, leading to anosmia.

It was developed by Fritz Zwicky.Ritchey, T. (1998). General Morphological Analysis: A general method for non-quantified modeling. Overview General morphology was developed by Fritz Zwicky, the Bulgarian- born, Swiss-national astrophysicist based at the California Institute of Technology. Among others, Zwicky applied morphological analysis (MA) to astronomical studies and jet and rocket propulsion systems. As a problem- structuring and problem-solving technique, MA was designed for multi- dimensional, non-quantifiable problems where causal modelling and simulation do not function well, or at all. Zwicky developed this approach to address seemingly non-reducible complexity: using the technique of cross-consistency assessment (CCA), the system allows for reduction by identifying the possible solutions that actually exist, eliminating the illogical solution combinations in a grid box rather than reducing the number of variables involved. General morphology has found use in fields including engineering design, technological forecasting, organizational development and policy analysis.√Ålvarez, A. & Ritchey, T. (2015). \\"Applications of General Morphological Analysis: From Engineering Design to Policy Analysis\\", Acta Morphologica Generalis, Vol.4 No.1. Decomposition vs MA Problems that involve many governing factors, where most of them cannot be expressed numerically can be well suited for MA. The conventional approach is to break a complex system into parts, isolate the parts (dropping the 'trivial' elements) whose contributions are critical to the output and solve the simplified system for desired scenarios. The disadvantage of this method is that many real-world phenomena do not have obviously trivial elements and cannot be simplified. Morphological analysis works backwards from the output towards the system internals without a simplification step.Modelling Complex Socio-Technical Systems Using Morphological Analysis (Ritchey 2003-06) The system's interactions are fully accounted for in the analysis.

The resolution, passed on 25 October 1971, recognized the People's Republic of China (PRC) as \\"the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations\\" and removed the collective representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the United Nations. Background \\"China\\" was one of the original 51 member states of United Nations, which was created in 1945. At that time, Republic of China (ROC), led by the Chinese Nationalist Party, was the government of China. Also in 1945, civil war broke out between the ROC army and troops led by the Communist Party of China (CPC). In 1949, the CPC established the People's Republic of China (PRC) in Beijing, and the ROC government was forced to retreat to Taiwan, which Japan had renounced all right, title and claim to in the Treaty of San Francisco.Treaty of Peace with Japan After 1950, the PRC was in control of mainland China, while the ROC maintained control over Taiwan, Pescadores, and some small islands. The People's Republic of China claimed to be the successor state of the Republic of China, while the Nationalists in Taiwan championed the continued existence of the Republic of China. Both claimed to be the only legitimate Chinese government, and each refused to maintain diplomatic relations with countries that have recognized the other. The ROC continued to represent China in the UN until Resolution 2758 was passed. Article 3 of the UN Charter provides: Additionally, the Republic of China had signed and ratified the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations on 18 April 1961 and 19 December 1969 respectively. However, by the late 1960s concerns regarding human rights surged, turning the tables of the situation. Proceedings at the United Nations On 15 July 1971, 17 UN members, led by Albania, requested that a question of the \\"Restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations\\" be placed on the provisional agenda of the twenty-sixth session of the UN General Assembly.Yearbook of the United Nations, 1971, pp. 127‚Äì128, 136 In an explanatory memorandum accompanying their request, the 17 UN members observed that for years they had protested against what they considered were hostile and discriminatory policy followed by several governments with regard to the communist government of mainland China, which they considered to be the genuine representative of the Chinese people. The existence of the People's Republic of China, they declared, was a reality which could ‚Äúnot be changed to suit the myth of a so called Republic of China, fabricated out of a portion of Chinese territory‚Äù. In the view of the 17 UN members, the ROC were unlawful authorities installed in the island of Taiwan which claimed to represent China, and they remained there only because of the permanent presence of United States Armed Forces. No important international problems, they added, could be solved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. It was in the fundamental interests, they concluded, of the United Nations to \\"restore\\" promptly to the People's Republic of China its seat in the organization, thus putting an end to a \\"grave injustice\\" and \\"dangerous situation\\" which had been perpetuated in order to fulfill a policy that had been increasingly repudiated. This meant the immediate expulsion of the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek regime from the seat which it held in the United Nations. On 17 August 1971, the United States requested that a second item, \\"The representation of China in the United Nations\\" be placed on the provisional agenda, too. In the explanatory memorandum accompanying the U.S. request, the U.S. said that in dealing with the problem of the representation of China, the United Nations should take cognizance of the existence of both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China; it should reflect that incontestable reality in the manner in which it made provision for China's representation. The United Nations, the U.S. submitted, should not be required to take a position on the respective conflicting claims of the People's Republic of China or the Republic of China pending a peaceful resolution of the matter as called for by the United Nations Charter. Thus, the U.S. added, the People's Republic of China should be represented and at the same time provision should be made to ensure that the Republic of China was not deprived of its representation. On 22 September 1971 the United States proposed at the UN General Committee that the two items be combined into one item called \\"The Question of China\\". The proposal was, however, rejected by 12 votes to 9 with 3 abstentions. On 25 September 1971, the first Albanian-backed draft resolution, A/L.630 and Add.l and 2, was submitted by 23 states including 17 of the states which had joined in placing the question on the agenda, to \\"restore to the People's Republic of China all its rights and expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai- shek.\\" On 29 September 1971, a second draft resolution, A/L.632 and Add.l and 2, sponsored by 22 members including the U.S., was proposed declaring that any proposal to deprive the Republic of China of representation was an important question under Article 18 of the UN Charter, and thus would require a two- thirds supermajority for approval. On 29 September 1971, a third draft resolution, A/L.632 and Add.l and 2, sponsored by 19 members including the U.S., was proposed by which the Assembly would affirm the right of representation of the People's Republic of China and recommend that it be seated as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council but also affirm the continuing right of representation of the Republic of China. Voting situation in the UN general assembly with respect to resolution 2758 (1971) recognizing the People's Republic of China as \\"the only legitimate representative of China\\". Green = In favor, Red = Against, Blue = Abstention, Yellow = Non-voting, Grey = Non-UN-members or dependencies. On 15 October 1971 the representatives of 22 UN members requested the UN Secretary-General to distribute, as an official Assembly document a statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China dated 20 August 1971. In this statement, made in response to the U.S. letter of 17 August 1971 and its accompanying explanatory memorandum, the People's Republic of China declared that the U.S. proposal was a blatant exposure of the Nixon government's scheme of creating \\"two Chinas\\" in the United Nations. It added, there was only one China, the People's Republic of China. Taiwan, it added, was an inalienable part of Chinese territory and a province of China which had already been returned to the motherland after the Second World War. It went on to state that the U.S. was plotting to separate Taiwan from China and was wildly attempting to force members of the UN to submit to its will. The Chinese government declared that the Chinese people and government firmly opposed \\"two Chinas\\", \\"one China, one Taiwan\\" or any similar arrangements, as well as the claim that \\"the status of Taiwan remains to be determined\\". They declared they would have absolutely nothing to do with the UN in such scenarios. Discussion at the Assembly took place at 12 plenary meetings between 18 and 26 October 1971 with 73 member states taking part. During the debates four more draft resolutions were submitted - three by Tunisia and one by Saudi Arabia. Broadly, each of these draft resolutions was a variation on the third draft resolution described above, backed by the U.S. Notably, the Saudi-proposed resolution would have held that the people of the island of Taiwan had a right to self- determination. Similarly, the Tunisian resolution would have called for the Republic of China government to be represented in the United Nations under the name \\"Formosa\\". Algeria's representative in the debates submitted that to recognize that the government of the People's Republic of China was lawfully entitled to represent China did not imply the eviction of a member but the eviction of the representatives of a dissident minority regime. The U.S., in its submission, took the opposite view; arguing that adoption of the resolution expelling the representatives sent from Taipei would imply the termination of the membership of a longstanding member. The spokesman of the Republic of China submitted that his country had earned its place in the United Nations by virtue of its contribution to peace and freedom during the Second World War. He said the Chinese communist regime, which had never had the moral consent of the Chinese people, could in no way be regarded as the representative of the great Chinese nation. Various members including two permanent members of the security council, the United Kingdom and the USSR, argued that requiring the matter to be subject to a supermajority vote was not appropriate because the adoption of the Albanian proposed resolution did not involve the admission or expulsion of a member. Rather it concerned only credentials and Taiwan had never been a member. They argued there was only one Chinese state that was a member. Any other Chinese state would have to apply for membership in accordance with the Charter. On 25 October 1971 the voting took place. In the first vote held, the Assembly rejected the U.S. backed proposal that the matter would require a supermajority vote ‚Äî the 'important question motion'. The Assembly then voted on a separate U.S. proposal that the words \\"and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupied at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it\\" be removed from the draft resolution. This motion would have allowed the PRC to join the UN as \\"China's representative\\", while allowing the ROC to remain a regular UN member (if there had been enough votes for it). The motion was rejected by a vote of 61 to 51, with 16 abstentions. At this point the representative of the Republic of China, Ambassador Liu Chieh, stated \\"in view of the frenzy and irrational manner that has been exhibited in this hall, the delegation of the Republic of China has now decided not to take part in any further proceedings of this General Assembly.\\"History Mania: China Admitted To UN - 1971; Recording of proceedings at UN General Assembly, accessible on YouTube He said the \\"ideals upon which the UN was founded\\" had been \\"betrayed\\".History Mania: China Admitted To UN - 1971; Recording of proceedings at UN General Assembly, accessible on YouTube The Assembly then adopted draft Albanian proposed resolution A/L. 630 and Add.l and 2, by a roll-call vote of 76 to 35, with 17 abstentions, as Resolution 2758. The Beijing government began representing China at the UN from 15 November 1971 and its delegates were seated at the UN Security Council meeting held on 23 November 1971, the first such meeting where representatives of the Beijing government represented China. Later developments On 23 July 2007, Secretary-General of the UN Ban Ki-moon rejected Taiwan's membership bid to \\"join the UN under the name of Taiwan\\", citing Resolution 2758 as acknowledging that Taiwan is part of China.News.bbc.co.uk 2007 Since Resolution 2758 makes no mention of Taiwan, although the UN General Assembly submissions and debates concerning its adoption do, Ban Ki-moon's interpretation to this effect came under fire from the American mediaWall Street Journal Commentary, August 13, 2007 and was also opposed by several UN members led by the U.S. A report by the American think tank the Heritage Foundation, also suggests that the US government issued a nine-point d√©marche specifically rejecting the Secretary-General's statement. The US did not make any public pronouncement on the matter. Nevertheless, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's statement reflected long-standing UN policy and is mirrored in other documents promulgated by the United Nations. For example, the UN's \\"Final Clauses of Multilateral Treaties, Handbook\\", 2003 (a publication which predated his tenure in Office) states: > ...regarding the Taiwan Province of China, the Secretary-General follows the > General Assembly‚Äôs guidance incorporated in resolution 2758 (XXVI) of the > General Assembly of 25 October 1971 on the restoration of the lawful rights > of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in the United Nations. The General > Assembly decided to recognize the representatives of the Government of the > People‚Äôs Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China > to the United Nations. Hence, instruments received from the Taiwan Province > of China will not be accepted by the Secretary-General in his capacity as > depositary.\\"Final Clauses of Multilateral Treaties, Handbook\\", United > Nations, 2003 Controversy According to some viewpoints, Resolution 2758 solved the issue of \\"China's representation\\" in the United Nations‚Äîbut it left the issue of Taiwan's representation unresolved in a practical sense. The ROC government continues to hold de facto control over Taiwan and other islands. While the PRC claims sovereignty over all of \\"China\\" and claims that Taiwan is part of China, it does not exercise actual authority over Taiwan, though it continues to claim that it holds such sovereignty. Former president Ma Ying-jeou said during his term, \\"The Republic of China is a sovereign country, and mainland China is part of our territory according to the Constitution. Therefore, our relations with the mainland are not international relations. It is a special relationship\\".Ma accused of 'lying' about relations On the other hand, although policy has changed, and the ROC Government now focuses on representing the interests of the island of Taiwan formally via its constitution, the ROC still claims to be the state of China, and thus its juridical claim to the right to govern the whole of China still holds. Most importantly, although Taiwan has been governed by the ROC as a de facto separate country, de jure Taiwan was not transferred to China in the post-WWII San Francisco Peace Treaty, which left its disposition open. The pursuit of independence from \\"China\\" (either ROC, PRC, or both) is a controversial issue in Taiwanese politics. The ROC framed the issue as one involving \\"the expulsion of a member\\". The United Kingdom and the USSR, took a different view arguing that only one Chinese state was a member and so the question was merely one of which Chinese delegation's credentials to accept and that any other Chinese state would have to apply for membership in accordance with the Charter.Yearbook of the United Nations, 1971, pp. 127‚Äì128, 136 The Resolution has been criticized as illegal by the Republic of China government, since expulsion of a member requires the recommendation of the Security Council and can only occur if a nation \\"has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter,\\" according to Article 6.

Attempts were made to get a review of Resolution 2758 onto the agenda with a proposal in 1998 noting that \\"as to its return to the United Nations, the Government has made it clear that it no longer claims to represent all of China, but that it seeks representation only for its 21.8 million people\\". Actions by the ROC government under its \\"Taiwan-independence\\" leaning president, Chen Shui-ban, to apply for membership under the name \\"Taiwan\\" highlighted this intention. However, the ROC administration under Ma Ying-jeou dropped attempts to become a UN member state.

It had three floors of art galleries, three cinemas, a bookshop, a bar and a caf√© bar. Cornerhouse was operated by Greater Manchester Arts Centre Ltd, a registered charity. The buildings Cornerhouse occupied two buildings. The main building, 70 Oxford Street, was built for John Shaw in the early 1900s and was a furniture store run by the family until it closed in 1985. The building on the other side of the approach to Oxford Road station was designed by Peter Cummings, completed in 1934 and opened as a cinema, Tatler News Theatre, in May 1935. The cinema went through many changes of name (Essoldo, Tatler Classic, Tatler Cinema Club) before closing in 1981. History Outside the main entrance of Cornerhouse, June 2012 Cornerhouse was conceived by the Greater Manchester Visual Arts Trust, chaired by Sir Bob Scott. It opened with the support of the then Greater Manchester County Council and Manchester City Council, North West Arts Association (now part of Arts Council England) and the British Film Institute. Cornerhouse's first Director was Dewi Lewis, who had previously been Director of Bury Metro Arts. The building opened on 3 October 1985. The first film screened (on 18 October) was Nic Roeg's Insignificance. Dave Moutrey has been Director and CEO since 1998. Since its inception Cornerhouse has hosted the UK premiere of Quentin Tarantino‚Äôs Reservoir Dogs and was the first UK public gallery to commission work from Damien Hirst. In 2012, it was announced that Cornerhouse would merge with the Library Theatre Company to form HOME. In 2015, both organisations moved to new premises at the HOME centre. Programme The main cinema building in its last week of operation prior to re-opening in a new location as HOME - a joint venture with the Library Theatre Company, April 2015 The Cornerhouse offered independent cinema, and contemporary art in the galleries. Cornerhouse's contemporary visual art programme was dedicated to launching artists who had not received major institutional recognition in Britain. It also let mid-career artists realise new projects in commissions and exhibitions on and off-site. The visual arts programme presented works in all media, with an emphasis on film and video that has a strong link with the film programme. Cornerhouse produced or co-produced all of its exhibitions as well as a programme for each show. A regular feature of its visual arts programme was international group exhibitions which explored socio-political concerns. In 2011, Cornerhouse launched Artist Film, a project for the production and distribution longer films, starting with Gillian Wearing‚Äôs Self Made. Cornerhouse was a partner in the plus Tate programme. On average, 30 titles were screened across the three screens every month. The cinemas were open seven days a week, with daily matinee and evening performances (no matinees on Monday), making a total of almost 3,500 screenings annually. Cornerhouse film programme was international in scope and offered new and innovative film and video alongside more familiar work. This resulted in the screening of new films and re-releases; second runs of overlooked or underrated titles; classic and archive material; shorts, animation and documentary; avant garde film and television; and foreign language films. Alongside a variety of touring film programmes, Cornerhouse also ran two festivals every year ¬°Viva! SpanishThe ¬°Viva!

In Japanese Buddhism, jikininki (\\"human- eating ghosts\\"; pronounced shokujinki in modern Japanese), are similar to Gaki; the spirits of greedy, selfish or impious individuals who are cursed after death to seek out and eat human corpses. A similar story can be found as \\"Aozukin\\" in Ueda Akinari's Ugetsu Monogatari from 1776. Story It is said that there was a monk/priest, named Muso, who was traveling alone through the mountains in the Mino prefecture of Japan, when he lost his way. It was almost dark when he saw, up on a hill, an old , the home of solitary priests. He walked to the top of the hill and asked the inhabitant if he could stay the night. The only inhabitant was an old priest, who harshly refused Muso lodgings for the night; however, he told Muso that he could find food and a place to sleep down in a hamlet, nearby. Muso found the hamlet, where the headman welcomed him and promptly supplied him food and a place to sleep. A little before midnight that night, Muso was awakened by a young man, one of the villagers, who informed him that, earlier that day, before Muso had arrived, that his father had died. The young man had not told Muso earlier so he would not feel embarrassed or obliged to participate in ceremonies. However, the entire village was now leaving their homes for a nearby village, as it was custom to leave the corpse alone for the night or-else bad things would befall the village inhabitants. As a priest, Muso told the young man he would do his duty and perform the burial services and stay the night with the corpse. He was not afraid of the demons or evil spirits the young man spoke of. When the young man and the other villagers had left, Muso knelt by the corpse and the offerings and began the service. In the deepest part of the night, a shapeless being entered, while Muso was deep in meditation. Muso could not speak or move as he watched the shapeless being devour the corpse and the offerings. The next morning when the villagers had returned, Muso told the young man what had happened. The young man was not surprised. Muso then asked the young man why the priest up on the nearby hill did not do the ceremony. Confused, the young man told Muso that there was no priest who lived nearby and that there hadn't been for many years. When Muso spoke of the Anjitsu, too, the young man also denied its existence, as-well. Muso then departed from the village, now with proper directions to continue his journey. Although before he left area, Muso sought out the Anjitsu and the old priest living within it up-upon the top of the hill to see if he had indeed been mistaken. He found the hill and Anjitsu easily, and the old priest let him inside this time. The old priest then began to apologize for displaying his true form in front of Muso; he was none-other than the shapeless figure who had devoured the corpse in front of Muso the night-before. The old priest went on-to explain that he was now a Jikininki and how he had come to be one; after living a long, selfish life as a priest, only caring about the food and clothes his services had brought him--even at the expense of others in more need of them then he had been--after his death, the old priest had been reborn into the world as a Jikininki, doomed to feed upon the fresh corpses of others. The old priest then pleaded with Muso, then-&-there, to perform a Segaki Requiem-Service for him, right then-&-there, so that he could finally escape his horrible existence as a Jikininki. As Muso performed the service, all of a sudden the old priest disappeared, along with the Anjitsu, too. Muso found himself kneeling in the long grass up-upon the top of a hill before a tombstone of a priest and the ruins of the Anjitsu.

Port Richmond is bounded by Kill van Kull on the north, Jewett Avenue on the east, Forest Avenue on the south, and the Bayonne Bridge on the west. It is adjacent to West New Brighton to the east, Westerleigh to the south, and Elm Park and Mariners Harbor to the west. Formerly an independent village, it is one of the oldest neighborhoods on the island. In the 19th century it was an important transportation and industrial center of the island, but this role has vanished nearly completely, leaving a largely blue collar residential area bypassed by the shift of development of the island to its interior after the 1960s. The formerly bustling commercial center along Richmond Avenue (now Port Richmond Avenue) had been largely abandoned at the time, but many small businesses have opened in the area since the late 20th century. Port Richmond is part of Staten Island Community District 1 and its ZIP Code is 10302. Port Richmond is patrolled by the 121st Precinct of the New York City Police Department. History  Early exploration and settlement  The first white European contact with Staten Island was recorded in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano. In 1609 Henry Hudson established Dutch trade in the area and named the island Staaten Eylandt after the Staten-Generaal, the Dutch parliament. However, it was not until the mid-17th century that a mixed Dutch and French settlement was established at New Dorp. Settlers established a cemetery at nearby Port Richmond, which served as the burial ground for residents of northern Staten Island until 1696.Plaque at Dutch Reform Church. Viewed on 10/18/2009 The community of Port Richmond grew up around this cemetery, beginning with the Dutch Reform Church that was built there in the early 18th century. This colonnaded Church, still standing on Port Richmond Avenue was built in 1824 after a fire destroyed the original building. From those Dutch roots, Port Richmond evolved into a thriving waterfront industrial and transportation hub.Johnson, Marjorie. \\"Port Richmond.\\" The Encyclopedia of New York City. Ed. Kenneth T. Jackson. New Haven: Yale UP, 1995. p. 929 The village incorporated as Port Richmond in 1866, the same year as the Staten Island villages of New Brighton and Edgewater.Morris' Memorial History of Staten Island, New York; 1898; https://archive.org/stream/statenislandname00davi/statenislandname00davi_djvu.txt Dutch Reformed Church Port Richmond has had many names through the years. In the late 17th century it was known simply as The Burial Place. Subsequently, the area was alternately known as Bristol, New Bristol, Irvington, Cyrene, and Cityville. These names were proposed, but Port Richmond eventually won out in 1866. The name \\"Port Richmond\\" was given to the place by Rev. Dr. James Brownlee of the Dutch Reformed Church In 1700 the area was known as the \\"burial place\\" from a cemetery of the Reformed Church on Staten Island near the present Port Richmond Avenue along the waterfront. It later became a transfer point between ferries from New York City to New Brunswick, New Jersey. A ferry landing (called variously \\"Ryer's Landing\\", \\"Mercereau's Landing\\", and \\"Decker's Landing\\") was later constructed for a route linking Staten Island across the Kill Van Kull to Bergen Point (present-day Bayonne, New Jersey). The Bayonne Bridge was constructed in 1931 yet ferry service continued until 1962. 19th century Bayonne Bridge and a pond in Port Richmond Port Richmond Square, the corner of Richmond Terrace and Richmond Avenue Port Richmond's location on the Kull Van Kill made it a prime ferry launch from Staten Island to New Jersey. It was a transfer port for freight and passengers traveling by boat between New York City and New Brunswick, New Jersey. This point is the part of Staten Island closest to Port Elizabeth, New Jersey and was once called Mersereau's Point, after Mersereau's Ferry. This point was also known as Lambert's, Collyer's, and Bowman's Point. It was called Lambert's Point during the Revolutionary War and later Collyer's Point. Other ferries that operated from that point were: Dacosta's, Indian, Decker's, Ryers', and Hilleker's. Ryers' and Hilleker's ferries were in competition with one another until David Mersereau bought out both companies in the late 19th century. Ferries ran continually until shortly after the Bayonne Bridge was built in 1931. The area also became the site of an important stop on a coach route between the city and Philadelphia. Port Richmond Avenue has been known over the years as Church Road, Port Richmond Plank Road, Stone Road, and Richmond Avenue. The road is a continuation of an old highway called the Morningstar Road. Cornelius \\"Commodore\\" Vanderbilt, railway tycoon and patriarch of the Vanderbilt family, was born in the area in 1794. In 1836, former Vice President Aaron Burr died in Port Richmond at the St. James Hotel, a prominent hotel which once stood on Richmond Terrace until it was demolished. In the early 19th century, the area was an overnight coach stop between New York City and Philadelphia. In 1836, a public park was built. In the middle 19th century, the area began to attract immigrants from Ireland and Germany. Among the industries established in the area was the only whale oil processing plant on Staten Island. It was later replaced by a linseed oil processing plant that operated until the 20th century. Other industries included lumber and coal yards, as a dye processing plant. Because oyster harvesting was a booming business along the mudflats in New York Harbor, many successful oyster boat captains built mansions on Richmond Terrace facing the Kill van Kull in the 1840s and 1850s.http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/buyers/nychome-neighborhoods- statenisland-portrichmond.html Industries along the waterfront included lumber and coal yards. In 1883, Port Richmond was described as a model village: In 1866, the neighborhood was incorporated as Port Richmond. In the 1880s, the Staten Island Railway constructed a North Shore branch with a stop in the village on Richmond Avenue, which had become a main shopping area of the island. In the 1870, St. Philip's Baptist Church, the oldest of the three black Baptist congregations on the Island, was formed. The church still stands at 77 Bennett Street, next to the Port Richmond Library that was built with funds from Andrew Carnegie in 1902. At the beginning of the 20th century, the neighborhood attracted large numbers of Italian, Polish, Norwegian, and Swedish immigrants. Temple Emanu-El erected its domed, Classical building in 1907. 20th century When telephone service was upgraded in New York City in December 1930, a telephone exchange bearing the designation \\"Port Richmond 7\\" was created, its territory including the neighborhood itself along with many other communities on the western and central North Shore plus the island's then-sparsely populated, rural interior. This exchange was disconnected in 1948 when a \\"Port Washington 7\\" exchange was established to serve the town by that name in Nassau County, on Long Island; the Port Richmond exchange customers were moved to exchanges to the east, such as \\"Saint George 7.\\" The neighborhood suffered a severe economic decline in the latter half of the 20th century, largely as a result of the shift of development and commercial activity to the center of the island, following the construction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and Staten Island Mall. The North Shore Branch of the Staten Island Railway that ran through the neighborhood connecting it to St. George was mainly a freight railroad. It was owned by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and was briefly, in 1925 and 1926, used as a passenger service link to the ferry launch at St. George. This was suspended as the boat ride was slower than the usual B&O; trip to the CNJ Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey. During World War II some trains were used to move troops.Edward F. Bommer, \\"The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in New Jersey\\" 2001, 2004, http://jcrhs.org/B%26O.html This branch was closed in 1953, leaving behind a dilapidated track and Port Richmond station along Richmond (now Port Richmond) Avenue. Plans for reopening this line were studied at various times during the 1990s and early 2000s as a Staten Island light rail line. Demographics Welcome To Port Richmond sign Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Port Richmond was 20,191, a change of 2,149 (10.6%) from the 18,042 counted in 2000.

Accessed June 14, 2016. The entirety of Community District 1, which comprises Port Richmond and other neighborhoods on the North Shore, had 181,484 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.0 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 24% are between the ages of between 0‚Äì17, 27% between 25‚Äì44, and 26% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college- aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 13% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 1 was $48,018, though the median income in Port Richmond individually was $51,135. In 2018, an estimated 21% of Port Richmond and the North Shore residents lived in poverty, compared to 17% in all of Staten Island and 20% in all of New York City. One in fourteen residents (7%) were unemployed, compared to 6% in Staten Island and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 51% in Port Richmond and the North Shore, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 49% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Port Richmond and the North Shore are considered high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. The Black and Latino populations are largest in the northern section of the neighborhood, near Richmond Terrace. The southeastern portion of the neighborhood (roughly south of Post Avenue & east of Port Richmond Avenue) is the section with the largest percentage of Whites (almost 50%), and is sometimes referred to as \\"Port Richmond Center\\" or \\"Upper Port Richmond\\". The 10302 zip code (which is mostly Port Richmond, but also includes part of Westerleigh) has the highest percentage of Hispanics of any zip code on Staten Island, at 41.3%. Within the Hispanic population, it is the only zip code on Staten Island where Mexicans outnumber Puerto Ricans: Mexicans make up 20% of the population of the zip code. The zip code includes parts of nearby Westerleigh, so Mexicans make up roughly 23% of the population of Port Richmond, with the presence being highest along Port Richmond Avenue, and in the northern part of the neighborhood in general. Racial tensions between blacks and Hispanics The African-American community that had long occupied Port Richmond's Northern quarters began to see a large influx of Mexican immigrants move in alongside them starting late in the 1980s. The Mexicans transformed many boarded up storefronts along Port Richmond Avenue and quickly made the commercial strip the center of Latino culture on Staten Island. Still many of Port Richmond's Mexicans line busy neighborhood streets every morning looking to be picked up for work as day laborers. Since they often commute on foot and usually have money in their pockets, the immigrants have long been targeted for violent muggings and senseless attacks on Port Richmond streets. The tensions between the area's long-time inhabitants and its newcomers have been well documented for years. Several outreach groups have since popped up to address the community's issues. Still, mistrust persists on both sides of the fence, as portions of northern Port Richmond (especially west of Port Richmond Avenue) have shifted from being predominantly Black to predominantly Hispanic.New York Times: \\"Attacks on Mexicans Leave Neighborhood in Turmoil\\" By KIRK SEMPLE July 30, 2010 Police surveillance tower at foot of Port Richmond Avenue Police presence, which was intensified This led to an incident, whence in the early morning hours of April 5, 2010, 26-year-old baker Rodulfo Olmedo was on his way home from a local club on Port Richmond Avenue when he was set upon by three African-American and one Hispanic teenagers, who badly beat Olmedo with unidentified objects believed to be baseball bats or wooden planks and possibly a chain before robbing his unconscious body of cash and a cellphone. After being helped by a passer-by and brought to the hospital, Olmedo, a 13-year resident of the U.S., told police that throughout the attack, which was captured on nearby surveillance cameras, he was verbally discriminated against. The attack provoked outrage both politically and locally, but while many felt the attack was solely a result of the victim's nationality, the attackers insisted that they knew Olmedo and were merely settling an earlier score with him. Regardless, the incident caused similar but unpublicized incidents, which had been taking place, to be publicized. After the incident, the United States Department of Justice began assisting community officials in their efforts to develop a neighborhood watch or a \\"Crime Response Team\\", a group of citizens that would possibly work with the NYPD to report suspicious activity and prevent more violence in the neighborhood, as well as to organize a series of meetings to facilitate community dialogue. They also set out to create \\"safe spaces\\", which was not the first time the idea was floated. These are willing businesses that are open late, such as bodegas or delis, where people who feel like they are being followed or otherwise fear for their safety, can seek refuge and be assisted by workers with contacting the police. Community activism and outreach Port Richmond has several community activist and outreach programs and organizations: *Northfield Community Local Development Corp. *Port Richmond Anti-Violence Task Force *Make the Road New York *Eye Openers Youth Against Violence *Project Hospitality *El Centro de Hospitalidad (Latino Civic Association of Staten Island) *Port Richmond Improvement Association *Community Health Action of Staten Island (formerly Staten Island Aids Task Force)/Port Richmond Wellness Center *Community Health Center of Richmond *Amazing Grace Interfaith Church *Community By Community *Labyrinth Arts Collective, Inc. Wagner College's Port Richmond Partnership Initiative In March 2008, local Wagner College chose Port Richmond as its target community to begin a five year plan between the college and seven community groups with the intention of focusing all of Wagner's volunteer activities squarely on the one community in hopes of improving the overall quality of life for the neighborhood's residents by curbing several disturbing trends in the neighborhood ranging from poor health care access, youth obesity, racial/ethnic tensions and youth violence to limited economic and educational opportunities. The students would then be required to report on their progress as part of their course requirements with the ultimate goal being to make significant improvements in the aforementioned fields and eventually branching out to other distressed North Shore neighborhoods. The Port Richmond initiative was lauded by former president Bill Clinton at The Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U) Meeting on February 14, 2009 at the University of Texas at Austin before a star-studded crowd. The CGI U is the college student/administrator-based offshoot of his Clinton Global Initiative, a non-partisan organization that convenes global leaders to devise and implement innovative solutions to the world's most pressing problems.http://www.wagner.edu/news/node/1129 Police and crime Port Richmond and the West Shore are patrolled by the 121st Precinct of the NYPD, located at 970 Richmond Avenue. The 121st Precinct was split from the 120th Precinct in 2013; the latter ranked 12th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. , with a non-fatal assault rate of 94 per 100,000 people, Port Richmond and the North Shore's rate of violent crimes per capita is more than that of the city as a whole.

The 121st Precinct saw 0 murders, 0 rapes, 0 robberies, 6 felony assaults, 1 burglary, 5 grand larcenies, and 2 grand larcenies auto in 2018. Port Richmond has long been plagued by high levels of crime, such as prostitution, drugs and violence. However, much of it takes place in the northern part of the neighborhood, north of roughly Post Avenue. In 2009, findings showed that Port Richmond (zip code 10302) received a 7 on a scale of 1-10 in terms of violent crime level - the highest for any zip code on Staten Island (one other Staten Island zip code also received a 7). The United States violent crime average for a zip code is a 3. Port Richmond also received a 6 on an identical scale measuring property crime. The United States property crime average for a zip code is also a 3.http://www.bestplaces.net/zip-code/Staten_Island-New_York-10302.aspx# Fire safety Ladder 79 on Castleton Avenue Port Richmond is served by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY)'s Engine Co. 157/Ladder Co. 80, located at 1573 Castleton Avenue.

It is served by many local and express buses, including the local buses; the limited-stop buses; and the express buses. The express bus routes ran to Port Richmond, but were discontinued by the MTA in 2010 due to budget cuts. The abandoned North Shore Branch of the Staten Island Railway runs through Port Richmond, and the area's eponymous station still stands. Historical sites Ritz Theater The Ritz Theater, a movie theater and vaudeville venue now a home improvement showroom, located at Port Richmond Avenue and Anderson Avenue, once hosted the biggest names in rock and roll and show business. It was built in 1924 by Sol Brill, who was also responsible for the construction of Staten Island's Liberty, New Dorp, and St. George Theaters. The spacious Ritz Theater boasted 2,126 seats and was one of New York's premier vaudeville houses. During the blizzard of 1947 the theater's marquee was destroyed and was never restored. The theater also served as a prime American rock concert venue in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Since 1985, the theater has been owned and operated as a tile showroom by the Pedulla family. Portions of the theater's original function can still be seen inside, and its famous murals still grace the walls. Old PS 20 Now essentially a retirement community, it is one of the few remaining examples of 19th-century school buildings in Staten Island. Old PS 20 was the site of a school since 1842, when the two-story brick building and old stable served as classrooms for the students. The building that now stands on the site was built in 1891 after the old buildings were condemned for sanitary reasons. An addition to the 1891 construction was added in 1898 by James Warriner Moulton who attempted to give the addition what he termed greater \\"strength\\" and a \\"more manly character.\\" The architecture of the building draws from a variety of styles including Romanesque Revival, neo-Classical, Italian villa, and Americanized Queen Anne. The hodge-podge of styles suggests a vernacular approach and reflects the reality of the 19th century, when school districts were responsible for designing, constructing, and maintaining their own buildings. Old PS 20 was within the Staten Island school district until it was disbanded following the consolidation of New York City in 1898. The bell tower on Old PS 20 is significant because it reflects civic pride. It was the first school building to have such an impressive tower and is the last remaining example. Old PS 20 was designated a Landmark Site by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1988.Public School 20 Annex, 160 Heberton Avenue, Borough of Staten Island: built 1891 and 1897‚Äì1898 : architect, 1891 section unknown : 1897‚Äì1898 section James Warriner Moulton. New York: The Landmarks Preservation Commission, 1988 121 Heberton Avenue 121 Herberton Avenue This is a -story frame building, is located on the eastern side of Veteran's Park, once the most fashionable locations in the neighborhood. Heberton Avenue is known for a plethora of handsome old houses. 121 Heberton, built by James G. Burger around 1859-61, is one of the most impressive. The residence is a rare surviving example in New York City of a picturesque villa in the Rustic style. The design combines elements seen in the pattern books of Gervase Wheeler, Calvert Vaux, and Samuel Sloan. Features associated with this style are broad gables, openwork brackets, long outside galleries, raised basement, and simple ornament. The house was first owned by a prosperous oysterman and abolitionist named Captain John J. Housman, then leased to tenants, and finally fell into the hands of the Brown family. The Browns had a number of notable family members in government in Richmond County. Though the house is no longer in the Brown family, it is still used as a residence today and recent renovations have preserved the unique historic quality of the house. The 121 Heberton Avenue House was designated a Landmark Site by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2002.121 Heberton Avenue House, 121 Heberton Avenue, Staten Island : built c. 1859-61 : James G. Burger, designer and builder. New York: Landmarks Preservation Commission, 2002. Bodine Creek Bodine Creek It is a short walk from The New York Public Library and Veteran's Park. Bodine has had many names over the centuries, including Palmer's Run and Mill Brook. Near Bodine Creek was Bodine's Pond, used for years by various industries. The Richmond County Water Company once supplied water to the area, but when Bodine's Pond was eventually drained, the wells of the company were sunk in the remaining marsh. The edges of the pond are still visible on the landscape in the form of Columbia Street and Jewett Avenue. In 1922, the New York Times reported that a 13-year-old boy was killed by a train while crabbing from the railway trestle over Bodine Creek. Other fatalities have been reported from drowning and train accidents. Port Richmond Hotel Port Richmond Hotel The Port Richmond Hotel, a barracks-like building facing the Bayonne ferry terminal, was once the elegant St. James Hotel. The St. James Hotel was erected in 1787 remained until 1945, when it was demolished. As identified by a plaque on the Griffith Block building, it was the last home of Aaron Burr, the third Vice President of the United States. He died there on September 14, 1836. Reformed Protestant Dutch Church and Burial Ground Tombstones Built in 1845 in Greek revival style, this is the third church on the site. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 as the Reformed Church on Staten Island. The first, a hexagonal wooden building erected in 1714, was destroyed by the British during the revolution. The original building, a long structure around which the community now known as Port Richmond grew, was erected on land donated in 1714 by Governor Hunter. The original license to the Dutch Congregation signed by Governor Hunter in 1714 is preserved.Federal Writer's Project. New York City Guide. New York: Octagon Books, 1970. Print. American Guide Series. p. 620 The grounds also serve in commemoration of the Five Brothers from Staten Island who served in the Revolutionary War. The Daughters of the American Revolution recognized the Brothers Mersereau: Joshua - 3rd Quarter Master General, Jacob - Colonel, Cornelius - Soldier, John - Captain, and Paul - Sailor. In media The cult classic movie release Combat Shock, the independent directing debut of Staten Island native Buddy Giovinazzo, is set in and was largely filmed in Port Richmond, where the main character dwells in apocalyptic squalor. The movie has been hailed for its raw depiction of inner city life and use of the gritty streetscapes it was filmed amid. In December 2009, Arcadia Publishing released a book named Port Richmond on its Images of America product line about the neighborhood's history, including its ethnic diversity and the effect various immigrant groups have had on the community. The book was written by Phillip Papas and Lori R. Weintrob.

She was the founding publisher and long-time editor of Poetry magazine, first published in 1912. As a supporter of the poets Wallace Stevens, Ezra Pound, H. D., T. S. Eliot, William Carlos Williams, Carl Sandburg, Max Michelson and others, Monroe played an important role in the development of modern poetry. Her correspondence with early twentieth century poets provides a wealth of information on their thoughts and motives. Biography thumb Monroe was born in Chicago, Illinois. She read at an early age; her father had a large library that provided refuge from domestic discord. In her autobiography, A Poet's Life: Seventy Years in a Changing World, published two years after her death, Monroe recalls: \\"I started in early with Shakespeare, Byron, Shelley, with Dickens and Thackeray; and always the book-lined library gave me a friendly assurance of companionship with lively and interesting people, gave me friends of the spirit to ease my loneliness.\\" Career Monroe graduated from the Visitation Academy of Georgetown, D.C., in 1879. She was later recognized as a very talented author for her age. Her prose piece published in 1899 in the Atlantic Monthly, The Grand Canyon of the Colorado,The Grand Canyon Reader by Eugene Reader, was considered better poetry than her most notable poem,Lovett, Robert Morrs, Review of A Poet's Life: Seventy Years in a Changing World Poetry Vol 52 no 1 April 1, 1938 I love my life.Love Song no 254 The New Poetry Anthology, 1957 Love Song 254 Driven by fears of posthumous anonymity, she proclaimed after graduation her determination to become \\"great and famous\\" as a poet or playwright. In the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Judith Paterson quoted her as saying, \\"I cannot remember when to die without leaving some memorable record did not seem to me a calamity too terrible to be borne.\\" She afterward devoted herself to literary work. Monroe in her biography said, 'I have sense of consecration that made me think I would prefer art to life'.Monroe, Harriet, A Poet's Life: Seventy Years in a Changing World, Macmillan And Co, New York, 1938 Though Century magazine published her poem, \\"With a Copy of Shelley,\\" in 1889, she became disillusioned by the limited earnings available for poets, saying: \\"The minor painter or sculptor was honored with large annual awards in our greatest cities, while the minor poet was a joke of the paragraphers, subject to the popular prejudice that his art thrived best on starvation in a garret.\\" She became a freelance correspondent to the Chicago Tribune, and was commissioned to write a commemorative ode for the 400th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America. Her financial hardships were alleviated after she sued the New York World for publishing the Colombian ode poem without her consent and she was awarded $5,000 in a settlement. With help from publisher Hobart Chatfield- Taylor, Monroe convinced one hundred prominent Chicago business leaders to sponsor the magazine Poetry by each committing to fifty dollars for a five- year subscription. The $5,000, coupled with her own settlement, was enough to launch the magazine on September 23, 1912, while upholding its promise to contributors of adequate payment for all published work. Monroe was editor for its first two years without salary, while simultaneously working as an art critic for the Chicago Tribune. By 1914, the magazine work became too much for her to accomplish while working other jobs, so she resigned from the Tribune and accepted a salary of fifty dollars per month from the magazine. For more than ten years she maintained herself on this stipend, raising it to one hundred dollars per month in 1925. Don Share, who became editor of Poetry in 2013, writes that Monroe seemed to have a \\"sixth sense\\" about the poetry she published. Monroe, herself, wrote and preferred poems rooted in 19th century tradition, but in her magazine, \\"that countervailing sixth sense allowed her to make literary history. She invented a box, you could say ‚Äî and promptly set to work thinking outside it. Her magazine was, therefore, like she was: unpredictable, difficult, and infuriating,\\" but she never wavered in her assessment of progressive American culture as a democratic triumph.Schultze, Robin G, 'Legacy' Vol 21, no 1 2004 She continued editing the magazine until she died in Arequipa, Peru, at age 75, while on her way to climb Machu Picchu. The high altitudes reportedly triggered a cerebral hemorrhage, which caused her death. Monroe was a member of the Eagle's Nest Art Colony in Ogle County, Illinois, and is mentioned in Erik Larson's The Devil in the White City. In 2011, Monroe was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame. Family Monroe was the sister-in-law of Chicago architect John Wellborn Root, and wrote his biography.

A child of superhuman strength, he was raised by a yama-uba (\\"mountain witch\\") on Mount Ashigara. He became friendly with the animals of the mountain, and later, after catching Shuten-d≈çji, the terror of the region around Mount ≈åe, he became a loyal follower of Minamoto no Yorimitsu under the new name . He is a popular figure in Bunraku and kabuki drama, and it is a custom to put up a Kintar≈ç doll on Boy's Day in the hope that boys will become equally brave and strong. Kintar≈ç is supposedly based on a real person, Sakata Kintoki, who lived during the Heian period and probably came from what is now the city of Minamiashigara, Kanagawa. He served as a retainer for the samurai Minamoto no Yorimitsu and became well known for his abilities as a warrior. As with many larger-than-life individuals, his legend has grown with time. Legend Several competing stories tell of Kintar≈ç's childhood. In one, he was raised by his mother, Princess Yaegiri, daughter of a wealthy man named Shiman-ch≈çja, in the village of Jizodo, near Mount Ashigara. In a competing legend, his mother gave birth to him in what is now Sakata, Yamagata. She was forced to flee, however, due to fighting between her husband, a samurai named Sakata, and his uncle. She finally settled in the forests of Mount Ashigara to raise her son. Alternatively, Kintar≈ç's real mother left the child in the wilds or died and left him an orphan, and he was raised by a yama-uba or \\"mountain witch\\" (one tale says Kintar≈ç's mother raised him in the wilds, but due to her haggard appearance, she came to be called yama-uba). In the most fanciful version of the tale, the yama-uba was Kintar≈ç's mother, impregnated by a clap of thunder sent from a red dragon of Mount Ashigara. The legends agree that even as a toddler, Kintar≈ç was active and indefatigable, plump and ruddy, wearing only a bib with the kanji for \\"gold\\" (Èáë) on it. His only other accoutrement was a hatchet (ono or masakari). He was bossy to other children (or there simply were no other children in the forest), so his friends were mainly the animals of Mt. Kintoki and Mt. Ashigara. He was also phenomenally strong, able to smash rocks into pieces, uproot trees, and bend trunks like twigs. His animal friends served him as messengers and mounts, and some legends say that he even learned to speak their language. Several tales tell of Kintar≈ç's adventures, fighting monsters and oni (demons), beating bears in sumo wrestling, and helping the local woodcutters fell trees. Oniwakamaru and the Giant Carp Fight Underwater by Utagawa Kuniyoshi, 1835, Brooklyn Museum As an adult, Kintar≈ç changed his name to Sakata no Kintoki. He met the samurai Minamoto no Yorimitsu as he passed through the area around Mt. Kintoki. Yorimitsu was impressed by Kintar≈ç's enormous strength, so he took him as one of his personal retainers to live with him in Kyoto.Piggott, J. (1997). Japanese Mythology. London: Chancellor Press. Kintoki studied martial arts there and eventually became the chief of Yorimitsu's Shitenn≈ç (\\"four braves\\"), renowned for his strength and martial prowess. He eventually went back for his mother and brought her to Kyoto as well. In modern Japan Kintar≈ç is an extremely popular figure in Japan, and his image adorns everything from statues to storybooks, anime, manga to action figures. For example, the manga and anime Golden Boy stars a character with the same name. Kintar≈ç as an image is characterized with an ono, a haragake apron, and sometimes a tame bear. In many of Kintar≈ç's pictures, it seems that he is trying to capture a giant black koi. This seems to glorify his strength as he is able to wrestle with such creature. Kintar≈ç candy has been around since the Edo period; no matter how the cylinder-shaped candy is cut, Kintar≈ç's face appears inside. Japanese tradition is to decorate the room of a newborn baby boy with Kintar≈ç dolls on Children's Day (May 5) so that the child will grow up to be strong like the Golden Boy. A shrine dedicated to the folk hero lies at the foot of Mount Ashigara in the Hakone area near Tokyo. Nearby is a giant boulder that was supposedly chopped in half by the boy hero himself. Kintar≈ç holding a carp with an axe (Masakari). The name and certain traits of the main character of Gin Tama, Gintoki Sakata, are loosely based on Kintar≈ç. The relation has also been confirmed in Gin Tama's episode 98 and manga volume 10. Gintoki has its name contain the character for \\"silver\\" instead of \\"gold\\", and he has silver hair. One of his nemeses, the golden- haired Sakata Kintoki, also made an appearance. * In the anime series Otogi Zoshi, Kintaro is one of the main characters. * The Imagin Kintaros from the tokusatsu series Kamen Rider Den-O is based on Kintar≈ç, emulating the bear and axe elements. * In the video game Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors developed by From Software, Kintoki wields a large axe as his main weapon, known as the 'Crimson Axe'. * Kintar≈ç appears as an alien character who rides a flying bear and wields a small (but large for his size) axe in the animated television series Urusei Yatsura. * In the anime and manga series The Prince of Tennis, a character by the name of T≈çyama Kintar≈ç is the youngest regular member of the Shitenhoji Middle School tennis team.

Soviet Jewish refuseniks demonstrate in front of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the right to emigrate to Israel. A type 2 USSR exit visa. This type of visa was issued to those who received permission to leave the USSR permanently and lost their Soviet citizenship. Many people who wanted to emigrate were unable to receive this kind of exit visa. Refusenik (, otkaznik, from \\"–æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑\\", otkaz \\"refusal\\") was an unofficial term for individuals‚Äîtypically, but not exclusively, Soviet Jews‚Äîwho were denied permission to emigrate, primarily to Israel, by the authorities of the Soviet Union and other countries of the Eastern bloc.Mark Azbel' and Grace Pierce Forbes. Refusenik, trapped in the Soviet Union. Houghton Mifflin, 1981. The term refusenik is derived from the \\"refusal\\" handed down to a prospective emigrant from the Soviet authorities. In addition to the Jews, broader categories included: *Other ethnicities, such as Volga Germans attempting to leave for Germany, Armenians wanting to join their diaspora, and Greeks forcibly removed by Stalin from Crimea and other southern lands to Siberia. *Members of persecuted religious groups, such as the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, Baptists and other Protestant groups, Russian Mennonites, and Jehovah's Witnesses. A typical basis to deny emigration was the real or alleged association with Soviet state secrets. Some individuals were labelled as foreign spies or potential seditionists who purportedly wanted to abuse Israeli aliyah and Law of Return (right to return) as a means of escaping punishment for high treason or sedition from abroad. Applying for an exit visa was a step noted by the KGB, so that future career prospects, always uncertain for Soviet Jews, could be impaired. As a rule, Soviet dissidents and refuseniks were fired from their workplaces and denied employment according to their major specialty. As a result, they had to find a menial job, such as a street sweeper, or face imprisonment on charges of social parasitism.\\"–ó–ª–æ—É–ø–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω–æ–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º –æ —Ç—Ä—É–¥–µ\\" , a document of the Moscow Helsinki Group. The ban on Jewish immigration to Israel was lifted in 1971 leading to the 1970s Soviet Union aliyah. The coming to power of Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, and his policies of glasnost and perestroika, as well as a desire for better relations with the West, led to major changes, and most refuseniks were allowed to emigrate. Over time, \\"refusenik\\" has entered colloquial English for a person who refuses to do something, especially by way of protest.Oxford English Dictionary,(online). Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2012-06-08. History of the Jewish refuseniks  A large number of Soviet Jews applied for exit visas to leave the Soviet Union, especially in the period following the 1967 Six-Day War. While some were allowed to leave, many were refused permission to emigrate, either immediately or after their cases would languish for years in the OVIR (–û–í–∏–†, \\"–û—Ç–¥–µ–ª –í–∏–∑ –∏ –†–µ–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏\\", \\"Otdel Viz i Registratsii\\", English: Office of Visas and Registration), the MVD (Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs) department responsible for exit visas. In many instances, the reason given for denial was that these persons had been given access, at some point in their careers, to information vital to Soviet national security and could not now be allowed to leave. During the Cold War, Soviet Jews were thought to be a security liability or possible traitors.Joseph Dunner. Anti-Jewish discrimination since the end of World War II. Case Studies on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms: A World Survey. Vol. 1. Willem A. Veenhoven and Winifred Crum Ewing (Editors). Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. 1975. Hague. , ; pages 69-82 To apply for an exit visa, the applicants (and often their entire families) would have to quit their jobs, which in turn would make them vulnerable to charges of social parasitism, a criminal offense. Many Jews encountered systematic, institutional antisemitism which blocked their opportunities for advancement. Some government sectors were almost entirely off-limits to Jews.Benjamin Pinkus. The Jews of the Soviet Union: the history of a national minority. Cambridge University Press, January 1990. ; pp. 229-230. In addition, Soviet restrictions on religious education and expression prevented Jews from engaging in Jewish cultural and religious life. While these restrictions led many Jews to seek emigration,Boris Morozov (Editor). Documents on Soviet Jewish Emigration. Taylor & Francis, 1999. requesting an exit visa was itself seen as an act of betrayal by Soviet authorities. Thus, prospective emigrants requested permission to emigrate at great personal risk, knowing that an official refusal would often be accompanied by dismissal from work and other forms of social ostracism and economic pressure. At the same time, strong international condemnations caused the Soviet authorities to significantly increase the emigration quota. In the years 1960 through 1970, only 4,000 people (legally) emigrated from the USSR. In the following decade, the number rose to 250,000, to fall again by 1980.  Hijacking incident  In 1970, a group of sixteen refuseniks (two of whom were non-Jewish), organized by dissident Eduard Kuznetsov (who already served a seven-year term in Soviet prisons), plotted to buy all the seats for the local flight Leningrad-Priozersk, under the guise of a trip to a wedding, on a small 12-seater aircraft Antonov An-2 (colloquially known as \\"–∫—É–∫—É—Ä—É–∑–Ω–∏–∫\\", kukuruznik), throw out the pilots before takeoff from an intermediate stop and fly it to Sweden, knowing they faced a huge risk of being captured or shot down. One of the participants, Mark Dymshits, was a former military pilot. On 15 June 1970, after arriving at Smolnoye (later Rzhevka) Airport near Leningrad, the entire group of the \\"wedding guests\\" was arrested by the MVD. The accused were charged for high treason, punishable by the death sentence under Article 64 of the Penal code of the RSFSR. Mark Dymshits and Eduard Kuznetsov were sentenced to capital punishment but after international protests, it was appealed and replaced with 15 years of incarceration; Yosef Mendelevitch and Yuri Fedorov: 15 years; Aleksey Murzhenko: 14 years; Sylva Zalmanson (Kuznetsov's wife and the only woman on trial): 10 years; Arie (Leib) Knokh: 13 years; Anatoli Altmann: 12 years; Boris Penson: 10 years; Israel Zalmanson: 8 years; Wolf Zalmanson (brother of Sylva and Israel): 10 years; Mendel Bodnya: 4 years.  Crackdown on the refusenik activism and its growth  Jewish emigration from USSR, before and after the First Leningrad Trial The affair was followed by a crackdown on the Jewish and dissident movement throughout the USSR. Activists were arrested, makeshift centers for studying the Hebrew language and Torah were closed, and more trials followed. At the same time, strong international condemnations caused the Soviet authorities to significantly increase the emigration quota. In the years 1960 through 1970, only about 3,000 Soviet Jews had (legally) emigrated from the USSR; after the trial, in the period from 1971 to 1980 347,100 people received a visa to leave the USSR, 245,951 of them were Jews. Refuseniks included Jews who desired to emigrate on religious grounds, Jews seeking to immigrate to Israel for Zionist aspirations, and relatively secular Jews desiring to escape continuous state-sponsored antisemitism. A leading proponent and spokesman for the refusenik rights during the mid-1970s was Natan Sharansky. Sharansky's involvement with the Moscow Helsinki Group helped to establish the struggle for emigration rights within the greater context of the human rights movement in the USSR. His arrest on charges of espionage and treason and subsequent trial contributed to international support for the refusenik cause.  International pressure  Yuli Edelstein, one of the Soviet Union's most prominent refuseniks, who has served as Speaker of the Knesset (Israel's parliament) from 2013-2020. On 18 October 1976, 13 Jewish refuseniks came to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to petition for explanations of denials of their right to emigrate from the USSR, as affirmed under the Helsinki Final Act. Failing to receive any answer, they assembled in the reception room of the Presidium on the following day. After a few hours of waiting, they were seized by the police, taken outside of the city limits and beaten. Two of them were kept in police custody. In the next week, following an unsuccessful meeting between the activists' leaders and the Soviet Minister of Internal Affairs, General Nikolay Shchelokov, these abuses of law inspired several demonstrations in the Soviet capital. On Monday, 25 October 1976, 22 activists, including Mark Azbel, Felix Kandel, Alexander Lerner, Ida Nudel, Anatoly Shcharansky, Vladimir Slepak, and Michael Zeleny, were arrested in Moscow on their way to the next demonstration. They were convicted of hooliganism and incarcerated in the detention center Beryozka and other penitentiaries in and around Moscow. An unrelated party, artist Victor Motko, arrested in Dzerzhinsky Square, was detained along with the protesters in recognition of his prior attempts to emigrate from the USSR. These events were covered by several British and American journalists including David K. Shipler, Craig R. Whitney, and Christopher S. Wren. The October demonstrations and arrests coincided with the end of the 1976 United States presidential election. On October 25, U.S. Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter expressed his support of the protesters in a telegram sent to Scharansky, and urged the Soviet authorities to release them.

On 9 November 1976, a week after Carter won the Presidential election, the Soviet authorities released all but two of the previously arrested protesters. Several more were subsequently rearrested and incarcerated or exiled to Siberia. On 1 June 1978, refuseniks Vladimir and Maria Slepak stood on the eighth story balcony of their apartment building. By then they had been denied permission to emigrate for over 8 years. Vladimir displayed a banner that read \\"Let us go to our son in Israel\\". His wife Maria held a banner that read \\"Visa for my son\\". Fellow refusenik and Helsinki activist Ida Nudel held a similar display on the balcony of her own apartment. They were all arrested and charged with malicious hooliganism in violation of Article 206.2 of the Penal Code of the Soviet Union. The Moscow Helsinki Group protested their arrests in circulars dated 5 and 15 June of that year. Vladimir Slepak and Ida Nudel were convicted of all charges. They served 5 and 4 years in Siberian exile.http://www.angelfire.com/sc3/soviet_jews_exodus/SovietNews_s/Gilbert_Secrets.shtml Documentary films * Operation Wedding: a documentary film by filmmaker Anat Zalmanson-Kuznetsov, about her parents story Sylva Zalmanson and Eduard Kuznetsov, leading characters of Dymshits‚ÄìKuznetsov hijacking affair‚Äîa daring escape attempt from the USSR in 1970 that kickstarted the Soviet Jewry movement.https://www.operation-wedding-documentary.com/ * In 2008 filmmaker Laura Bialis released a documentary film, Refusenik, chronicling the human rights struggle of the Soviet refuseniks.\\"The struggle behind the Iron Curtain\\".

Japanese afterlife According to traditional Japanese beliefs, all humans have a spirit or soul called a ÈúäÈ≠Ç (reikon). When a person dies, the reikon leaves the body and enters a form of purgatory, where it waits for the proper funeral and post-funeral rites to be performed so that it may join its ancestors. If this is done correctly, the reikon is believed to be a protector of the living family and to return yearly in August during the Obon Festival to receive thanks. If the person dies, however, in a sudden or violent manner such as murder or suicide, if the proper rites have not been performed, or if they are influenced by powerful emotions such as a desire for revenge, love, jealousy, hatred or sorrow, the reikon is believed to transform into a y≈´rei which can then bridge the gap back to the physical world. The emotion or thought need not be particularly strong or driven. Even innocuous thoughts can cause a death to become disturbed. Once a thought enters the mind of a dying person, their y≈´rei will come back to complete the action last thought of before returning to the cycle of reincarnation. The y≈´rei then exists on Earth until it can be laid to rest, either by performing the missing rituals, or resolving the emotional conflict that still ties it to the physical plane. If the rituals are not completed or the conflict left unresolved, the y≈´rei will persist in its haunting. Oftentimes the lower the social rank of the person who died violently or who was treated harshly during life, the more powerful as a y≈´rei they would return. This is illustrated in the fate of Oiwa in the story Yotsuya Kaidan, or the servant Okiku in Banch≈ç Sarayashiki. Appearance In the late 17th century, a game called Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai became popular, and kaidan increasingly became a subject for theater, literature and other arts. Ukiyo-e artist Maruyama ≈åkyo created the first known example of the now-traditional y≈´rei, in his painting The Ghost of Oyuki. The Zensh≈ç-an in Tokyo houses the largest single collection of y≈´rei paintings which are only shown in August, the traditional month of the spirits. Today, the appearance of y≈´rei is somewhat uniform, instantly signalling the ghostly nature of the figure, and assuring that it is culturally authentic. * White clothing: Y≈´rei are usually dressed in white, signifying the white burial kimono used in Edo period funeral rituals. In Shinto, white is a color of ritual purity, traditionally reserved for priests and the dead. This kimono can either be a katabira (a plain, white, unlined kimono) or a kyokatabira (a white katabira inscribed with Buddhist sutras). They sometimes have a hitaikakushi (lit. \\"forehead cover\\"), which is a small white triangular piece of cloth tied around the head. * Black hair: The hair of a y≈´rei is often long, black and disheveled, which some believe to be a trademark carried over from kabuki theater, where wigs are used for all actors. This is a misconception: Japanese women traditionally grew their hair long and wore it pinned up, and it was let down for the funeral and burial. * Hands and feet: The hands of a y≈´rei are said to dangle lifelessly from the wrists, which are held outstretched with the elbows near the body. They typically lack legs and feet, floating in the air. These features originated in Edo period ukiyo-e prints, and were quickly copied over to kabuki. In kabuki, this lack of legs and feet is often represented by using a very long kimono or even hoisting the actor into the air by a series of ropes and pulleys. * Hitodama: Y≈´rei are frequently depicted as being accompanied by a pair of floating flames or will o' the wisps (hitodama in Japanese) in eerie colors such as blue, green, or purple. These ghostly flames are separate parts of the ghost rather than independent spirits. Classifications Y≈´rei While all Japanese ghosts are called y≈´rei, within that category there are several specific types of phantom, classified mainly by the manner they died or their reason for returning to Earth: * Onry≈ç: Vengeful ghosts who come back from purgatory for a wrong done to them during their lifetime. * Ubume: A mother ghost who died in childbirth, or died leaving young children behind. This y≈´rei returns to care for her children, often bringing them sweets. * Gory≈ç: Vengeful ghosts of the aristocratic class, especially those who were martyred. * Funay≈´rei: The ghosts of those who died at sea. These ghosts are sometimes depicted as scaly fish-like humanoids and some may even have a form similar to that of a mermaid or merman. * Zashiki-warashi: The ghosts of children; often mischievous rather than dangerous. * : These spirits do not seek to fulfill an exact purpose and wanders around aimlessly. In ancient times, the disease of the Emperor of Japan was thought to arise as a result of these spirits floating in the air. * : Similar to a fuy≈´rei and is rare, these spirits do not seek to fulfill an exact purpose and are instead bound to a specific place or situation. Famous examples of this include the famous story of Okiku at the well of Himeji Castle and the hauntings in the film Ju-On: The Grudge. Buddhist ghosts There are two types of ghosts specific to Buddhism, both being examples of unfulfilled earthly hungers being carried on after death. They are different from other classifications of y≈´rei due to their religious nature: * Gaki * Jikininki Ikiry≈ç In Japanese folklore, not only the dead are able to manifest their reikon for a haunting. Living creatures possessed by extraordinary jealousy or rage can release their spirit as an , a living ghost that can enact its will while still alive. The most famous example of an ikiryo is Rokuj≈ç no Miyasundokoro, from the novel The Tale of Genji. A mistress of the titular Genji who falls deeply in love with him, the lady Rokuj≈ç is an ambitious woman whose ambition is denied upon the death of her husband. The jealousy she repressed over Genji transformed her slowly into a demon, and then took shape as an ikiry≈ç upon discovering that Genji's wife was pregnant. This ikiry≈ç possessed Genji's wife, ultimately leading to her demise. Upon realising that her jealousy had caused this misfortune, she locked herself away and became a nun until her death, after which time her spirit continued to haunt Genji until her daughter performed the correct spiritual rites. Hauntings Y≈´rei often fall under the general umbrella term of obake, derived from the verb bakeru, meaning \\"to change\\"; thus obake are preternatural beings who have undergone some sort of change, from the natural realm to the supernatural. However, y≈´rei differ from traditional bakemono due to their temporal specificity. The y≈´rei is one of the only creatures in Japanese mythology to have a preferred haunting time (midtime of the hours of the Ox; around 2:00 am‚Äì2:30 am, when the veils between the world of the dead and the world of the living are at their thinnest). By comparison, normal obake could strike at any time, often darkening or changing their surroundings should they feel the need. Similarly, y≈´rei are more bound to specific locations of haunting than the average bakemono, which are free to haunt any place without being bound to it.'''' Yanagita Kunio generally distinguishes y≈´rei from obake by noting that y≈´rei tend to have a specific purpose for their haunting, such as vengeance or completing unfinished business. While for many y≈´rei this business is concluded, some y≈´rei, such as Okiku, remain earthbound due to the fact that their business is not possible to complete. In the case of Okiku, this business is counting plates hoping to find a full set, but the last plate is invariably missing or broken according to the different retellings of the story. This means that their spirit can never find peace, and thus will remain a jibakurei. Famous hauntings Some famous locations that are said to be haunted by y≈´rei are the well of Himeji Castle, haunted by the ghost of Okiku, and Aokigahara, the forest at the bottom of Mount Fuji, which is a popular location for suicide. A particularly powerful onry≈ç, known as Oiwa, is said to be able to bring vengeance on any actress portraying her part in a theater or film adaptation. Okiku, Oiwa, and the lovesick Otsuya together make up the of Japanese culture. These are y≈´rei whose stories have been passed down and retold throughout the centuries, and whose characteristics along with their circumstances and fates have formed a large part of Japanese art and society. Exorcism The easiest way to exorcise a y≈´rei is to help it fulfill its purpose. When the reason for the strong emotion binding the spirit to Earth is gone, the y≈´rei is satisfied and can move on. Traditionally, this is accomplished by family members enacting revenge upon the y≈´reis slayer, or when the ghost consummates its passion/love with its intended lover, or when its remains are discovered and given a proper burial with all rites performed. The emotions of the onry≈ç are particularly strong, and they are the least likely to be pacified by these methods. On occasion, Buddhist priests and mountain ascetics were hired to perform services on those whose unusual or unfortunate deaths could result in their transition into a vengeful ghost, a practice similar to exorcism. Sometimes these ghosts would be deified in order to placate their spirits. Like many monsters of Japanese folklore, malicious y≈´rei are repelled by , holy Shinto writings containing the name of a kami. The ofuda must generally be placed on the y≈´reis forehead to banish the spirit, although they can be attached to a house's entry ways to prevent the y≈´rei from entering.

Founded in 1804 as Imperial Kazan University, famous mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky served there as the rector from 1827 until 1846. In 1925, the university was renamed in honour of its most famous student Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin). The university is known as the birthplace of organic chemistry due to works by Aleksandr Butlerov, Vladimir Markovnikov, Aleksandr Arbuzov, and the birthplace of electron spin resonance discovered by Evgeny Zavoisky. In 2010, Kazan University received a federal status. It is also one of 15 Russian universities that were initially selected to participate in the Project 5-100, coordinated by the Government of the Russian Federation and aimed to improve their international competitiveness among the world‚Äôs leading research and educational centers. As of January 2020, the university comprises 18 primary educational units, 2 of which are territorial branches. More than 50,000 students are enrolled in over 600 degree programs at undergraduate and postgraduate level (including doctoral and double-degree programs with partner universities); the number of international students is about 9,700 from 106 countries. Research priority areas are concentrated on biomedicine and pharmaceutics, oil extraction, oil refining and petrochemistry, communications and aerospace technologies, advanced materials, and social sciences and humanities. History Among the subjects of special pride are the creation of non-Euclidean geometry by Nikolai Lobachevsky, the discovery of the chemical element Ruthenium by Karl Klauss, the theory of chemical structure of organic compounds by Aleksandr Butlerov, the discovery of electron paramagnetic resonance by Yevgeny Zavoisky and acoustic paramagnetic resonance by Semen Altshuler, the development of organophosphorus chemical compounds by Alexander and Boris Arbuzovs and many others. Since its inception, the university has prepared more than 70 thousand professionals. Among the university students and alumni there are outstanding scholars and famous people such as the founder of the Soviet Union Vladimir Lenin, writers Sergei Aksakov, Leo Tolstoy, Pavel Melnikov-Pechersky, Velimir Khlebnikov, composer Mily Balakirev, and painter Valery Yakobi. Imperial period Alexander I is credited with the university's foundation. Kazan University, one of the oldest universities in Russia, was founded on November 17, 1804, when Emperor Alexander I signed the Affirmative Letter and the Charter about the creation of the Kazan Imperial University. The first students, enrolled in 1805, were graduates of the First Kazan Gymnasium ‚Äì an autonomous affiliate of Moscow State University, under whose auspices Kazan University first operated. It was not until 1814 that the university underwent its full opening. It was restructured as a classical university comprising four departments: moral and political sciences, physical and mathematical sciences, medical sciences and philology. Before Tomsk University was founded, the University of Kazan used to be the easternmost university in the Russian Empire, it was thus serving for Volga, Kama, and Ural regions, Siberia and the Caucasus. In 1819, M. L. Magnitsky conducted a review of the university, in which he reported on 'the spirit of dissent and irreligion' that he had observed at the university. In his report to the Emperor, he spoke of the \\"public destruction\\" of the university and demanded it be closed, but Alexander I put the resolved 'why destroy what can be corrected'. Magnitsky was consequently appointed trustee of the Kazan school district, an action that negatively affected the university, with many professors being dismissed and 'harmful' books withdrawn from the library's collection. In addition, a strict barrack domestic regime was introduced for students of the university. In 1819‚Äì1821 an alumnus and scholar of Kazan University Ivan Simonov participated in the discovery of Antarctica during the first round-the-world expedition and pioneered Antarctic studies.left In 1825, the Main Building of the university was built and, in 1830, the Main Campus was completed. This included the Library Building, Chemical Laboratory, dissection facilities, astronomical observatory, and clinics (in the organisation of which contemporaries noted the leading role of Professor Franz Yellachich). Resultantly the university became a leading centre of education and science. It was the scientific faculties that were, at this time, organised into a number of research schools: mathematical, chemical, medical, geological. Since the first half of the 19th century Kazan University has been the largest center of Oriental Studies in Europe and the birthplace of the world-famous Kazan Linguistic School founded by Jan Baudouin de Courtenay. Just four years later, in 1834, the journal Proceedings of Kazan University began to be published by academicians of the university and in 1835 Nicholas I ordered to establish three faculties: Philosophical (which was further subdivided into verbal and physical-mathematical departments), Faculty of Law and Faculty of Medicine. Lenin as he appeared in 1887. In 1844, Karl Klaus, a professor at the university, discovered, and named in honour of Russia, Ruthenium, the only chemical element discovered in Tsarist Russia. Six years thereafter St. Petersburg University opened the Institute of Oriental Studies and all training materials and collections of Kazan University in this field were transferred to the capital of Imperial Russia. Shortly after that, there was a further reform of the university's structure, when in 1863, by the order of Alexander II, the university was reorganised into four departments: History and Philology, Physics and Mathematics, Law, and Medicine. A renowned linguistic school was forming at the university during 1875‚Äì1883. Around that time Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin), a future leader of the Soviet Union, studied law at the university from August 1887 until his expulsion due to 'student disturbances' in December 1887.Lenin.'An Unfinished Autobiography,' 1917. Collected Works, Vol. 41. (Moscow: Progress, 1977.p 430) The university faced one of its greatest challenges during the Russian Civil War, when in August‚ÄìSeptember 1918 the siege and ultimate capture of Kazan by the Red Army and Czechoslovak Corps led to a large exodus of students and faculty members from the city. Subsequently, many of them were enrolled in state universities in Siberia and help they provided proved instrumental in the foundation of universities in Tomsk and Irkutsk. =Kazan Higher Women's Courses= Though approval was given in the Imperial period for Women to audit university lectures from 1859, the Higher Courses were not state funded and required local support, carrying high tuition fees. When petitioned by the university to create courses for women, Dmitry Tolstoy suggested that a curriculum modeled on the Guerrier Courses might be acceptable, though he continuously blocked their implementation in Kazan. In 1876, the imperial government, hoping to secure more qualified teachers, authorized creation of Higher Women's Courses in all cities in the empire which had a university. From October 1876, female applicants who had completed a girls' gymnasium; were certified instructors in arithmetic, history and Russian language; or passed an entrance examination could enroll in evening classes at Kazan University. Those who did not meet those requirements could attend as external auditors, but were excluded from course examinations. Students took six mandatory courses in art history, physics, Russian history and literature, and world history and literature. Optional courses included hygiene, languages, and mathematics. In 1879, the founder of the Kazan Higher Women's Courses, N. V. Sorokin, expanded the offerings to include two specializations: \\"historical- philological and physico-mathematical\\". This opened up additional course offerings including algebra and geometry, chemistry, English language, German literature, geography, history of philosophy, history of physical and mathematical sciences, history of physics, and natural sciences. In 1881, aesthetics was added and in 1884, Latin began being offered as an elective class. The courses allowed women to access higher education for a decade before being permanently closed in 1886. In 1904, professors of the university formed a committee to reinstate the women's courses, but the plan was rejected because of it was economically not feasible. The plan was refused again in 1905, but in 1906, after the Revolution, authorities allowed the university to reinstate the Higher Women's Courses of the historical-philological department. The first Latvian to earn a degree in Folkloric Studies, Anna Bƒìrzkalne, graduated as a Candidate of Philology from the Kazan Higher Women's Courses in 1917. Soviet period In accordance with a directive from the Council of People's Commissars issued on October 9, 1918, the system of academic ranks was abolished and all university-level lecturers with at least three years of teaching experience were qualifying for the title of professor. This allowed the University of Kazan, which had lost the vast majority of its academic staff during the turmoil of the civil war, to restart proper education and research. The university's name appeared in Arabic-script Tatar on the main building before that script's abolition in 1928. The university soon opened a 'workers' faculty (fifth in the RSFSR), which aimed to provide the education for peasants. On 1 November 1919 peasant workers started their first classes without the requirement to pass an entrance exam. In 1922 the University's Faculty of Forestry merged with the Faculty of Agriculture of Kazan Polytechnic university to form Kazan Institute of Agriculture and Forestry. In 1925 by the decision of All-Russian Central Executive Committee Kazan State University was renamed to the V. I. Ulyanov-Lenin Kazan State University.Regulations of the Kazan State University ¬´–£—Å—Ç–∞–≤ –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —É—á—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤—ã—Å—à–µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ—Å—Å–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è \\"–ö–∞–∑–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –∏–º. –í.–ò.–£–ª—å—è–Ω–æ–≤–∞-–õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–∞¬ª This was done in order to recognise the period of time Vladimir Lenin spent as a student at the University of Kazan. In the 1930s the university continued to evolve with a number of its faculties being separated from it in order to become independent institutions of higher education. Some of them continue their existence, for instance Kazan State Medical University. Moreover, during the World War II years (1941‚Äì1943) a number of members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences were evacuated from Moscow and Leningrad and housed under the premises of the university; this, in turn, led to the foundation of Kazan Department of the Academy in 1945. In the post-war years the University of Kazan underwent a period of rapid expansion and development of its academic base. To recognize the hard work in providing education to the peoples of the Soviet Union Kazan State University was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1953 and later, in 1979, the Order of Lenin. In the 1970s the University's two distinctive high-rise academic buildings were built ‚Äì the Department of Physics in 1973 and Faculty of Mathematics in 1978. The final major Soviet-era change to the university came with the opening of UNICS Sports Center and Concert Hall in 1989.  21st century  On October 21, 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a presidential decree that established a new Volga Federal University on the basis of Kazan State University.Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signs a series of executive orders granting federal state autonomous university status to several Russian universities –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç –ø–æ–¥–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª –£–∫–∞–∑ ¬´–û —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–∏ —Ñ–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–æ–≤ –≤ –°–µ–≤–µ—Ä–æ-–ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–º, –ü—Ä–∏–≤–æ–ª–∂—Å–∫–æ–º, –£—Ä–∞–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–º –∏ –î–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–º —Ñ–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –æ–∫—Ä—É–≥–∞—Ö¬ª The federal university project is realized on the basis of Kazan State University, with the accession of the Tatar State University of Humanities and Education (TGGPU), Kazan State Finance and Economics Institute (KGFEI),Volga Federal University can join KSU, KGFEI, TGGPU and KGASU Elabuga State Pedagogical University and Naberezhnye Chelny Academy of Engineering and Economy.

Rankings and reputation After having obtained the status of a federal university, KFU tasked itself with advancing in the global rankings race. This is also the primary metric for the participants of the Project 5-100, a national initiative to boost the competitiveness of the top Russian universities, which Kazan University joined in 2013. The university has been ranked by QS World University Rankings since 2012, steadily climbing from 601+ to 392nd place. It also has 4 stars in QS Stars Ratings, along with another institution from Tatarstan, Kazan National Research Technical University named after A.N.Tupolev. It‚Äôs currently ranked 601 ‚Äì 800 by Times Higher Education. It‚Äôs also in the 201-300 bracket in University Impact and Good health and well-being rankings by the same organization. KFU first appeared in Academic Ranking of World Universities in 2018 and was ranked 801 ‚Äì 900 in that year and in 2019. The university is present in 10 subject areas in QS subject rankings and in 7 areas in Times Higher Education rankings. The most notable achievement is 94th place in THE subject rankings for Education in 2019. In Russian national rankings, Kazan University has been consistently ranked among the best, including 16th place in RAEX rankings and 9th place in Interfax National Ranking of Universities. Campus Kazan Federal University‚Äôs Main Campus is located in downtown Kazan, 10 minutes away from the Kazan Kremlin. The Main Building of Kazan University was designed by architect Petr Pyatnitsky and built in the 1820s. The oldest part of the today‚Äôs Main Building includes three classic portals along with the white foreside of the original 1822 construction. From 1832 to 1841, architect M. Korinfsky designed the rest of the buildings comprising the neo-classical Architectural Complex of Kazan University. The Main Building Yard now contains the central administrative offices, the Anatomical Theatre, the Library, chemistry and physics laboratories, and the Observatory. Chemical Faculty Building (since 2003: Alexander Butlerov Chemistry Institute) was built in 1953 with the support of students. The original building was built in the Soviet neoclassical style. In 1960-70s, two high-rise academic buildings were erected to the north and to the west of the Main Building. The most recent addition was in 2015, when a 7-storey laboratory building was added to the campus. By President Boris Yeltsin‚Äôs Decree in 1996 the Architectural Complex of Kazan University was added to the National Cultural Heritage Register of Russia. During the preparations for 200th anniversary of KFU the East Wing was added to the Main Building and today along with the university administration, the Museum of History of Kazan University, Yevgeny Zavoisky Lab-Museum, the Botanical Museum, Edward Eversman Zoology Museum, and two academic units ‚Äì the Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology together with the Faculty of Law reside there. University sport facilities include UNICS and Bustan Sports Centers built in 1989 and 2010. KFU is one of just few educational institutions in Russia which offers modern comfortable housing to all students outside of Kazan. KFU dormitory campus is located in the Universiade Village built to accommodate participants of the XXVII World Summer Universiade 2013. It is a residential micro-district for about 12,000 people with a medical center, drugstore, sports equipment rent station, copy center, laundry, beauty salon, cafeteria and other facilities available. The Village project was awarded a diploma \\"For a special contribution to a socially significant infrastructure creation for youth and sport development\\" at the world contest FIABCI Prix D‚ÄôExcellence. Altogether the premises of Kazan University are located throughout Russia in Tatarstan, Karachay- Cherkessia, Karelia, Mari El and Samara region (Tolyatti).

Global cooperation The very foundation of Kazan University was directly linked to international academia. Some of the University's first teachers were German professors such as Johann Bartels, Franz Erdman and Christian Fren. The famous German professor Karl Fuchs, who was both the founder of Kazan Medical School and the first European researcher of Tatar history and culture, became the University's rector in the 1820s and was awarded the title of Honourable Citizen of Kazan. KFU has partner agreementsKazan University at a Glance // Official site of Kazan (Volga region) Federal University with approximately 190 universities and research centres from more than 53 countries all over the world.

Library The Department of Rare Books and Manuscripts of Nikolai Lobachevsky Scientific Library Kazan University Nikolai Lobachevsky Scientific Library has one of the world's most important bibliographical collections, including 15,000 manuscripts and 3,000 rare books. Opened in 1809, it first contained Count G. Potemkin's books brought to Kazan in 1799 mixed with collections of the earliest bibliophiles V. Polyansky and N. Bulich. Subsequently, the collections of Solovetsky Monastery were added to the library. These original books remain and are kept in the special depository of the library. In this special collection are Arabic manuscripts of philosophers and scholars Mansur Al-Hallaj and Avicenna (11th century) and Ashshakhrestani (12th century), a manuscript copy of the Pentateuch, the first Russian printed book \\"The Apostle\\" (1564), the \\"Books of Kingdoms\\" by Francisco Skorin (1518) and the \\"Code of Tsar Alexis Mikhailovich\\" (1649). The Library has first editions of the 18th-century books by Pushkin, Griboyedov, Gogol, Nas√≠ri and Tuqay. The library contains many 19th-century periodicals, and literature about Kazan and the surrounding region. The library boasts itself as \\"the pride of the University and an invaluable source of information for any researcher.\\" The original library building was built between 1825 and 1833 by Rector N. Lobachevsky, who was at the same time the chief librarian of the university. The library, which now bears his name, is still growing, and even its new building cannot house all the collections. Kazan University also has many museums.

They contain sites of particular ecological, historical and aesthetic value. Regulated tourism is permitted.\\"About Special Protected Nature Areas\\", a Russian Federation federal law of March 14, 1995.Biodiversity Conservation Centre Moscow The area of each park is divided into zones according to various functions. There should be a strictly protected area managed as a zapovednik, and also recreational and buffer zones in which economic activity is allowed, such as tourism, traditional land use, and benign forms of agriculture and forestry. The strictly protected function is sometimes fulfilled by a neighbouring official zapovednik; for instance, Barguzin Zapovednik adjoins Zabaykalsky National Park on the east side of Lake Baikal. In 2001 Vodlozersky National Park received UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status, followed by Smolenskoye Poozerye and Ugra National Park in 2002, and two others (Valdaysky and Kenozersky) in 2004. The newest park is Bikin National Park, created in late 2015. The national parks are currently the responsibility of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Russia).

The game involves obliterating a series of defenses orbiting a stationary turret in the center of the screen. The display is black and white with the colors of the rings and screen provided by a transparent plastic screen overlay. Star Castle was designed by Tim Skelly and programmed by Scott Boden. Skelly also created a number of other Cinematronics titles, including Starhawk, Armor Attack, and Rip-Off. A Vectrex port of Star Castle for was released in 1983. Gameplay Star Castle showing the high-resolution vector display and the color overlay that provides the false color for the playfield. The object of Star Castle is to destroy an enemy cannon which sits in the center of three concentric, rotating energy shield rings while avoiding or destroying 'mines' - enemies that spawn from the core, pass through the energy rings, and then home in on the player's ship. They can stick back to the shield if the player maneuvers in such a way that a ring is between the ship and the mines. The player- controlled spaceship can rotate, thrust forward, and fire small projectiles. The cannon's shields are composed of twelve sections each, and each section takes two hits to destroy. Once a section is breached, rings beneath it are exposed to fire. Once the innermost ring has been breached, the central weapon is vulnerable to attack from the player. However, the player is also more vulnerable at this point, as with the shield rings eliminated, the gun can fire out a large projectile that hisses with white noise. Moreover, the central core tracks player movement at all times. If the player manages to hit the cannon, it explodes violently, collapsing the remnants of the shield rings, and the player is awarded with an extra ship. The next level then starts with a new gun and fully restored shield rings, with the difficulty increased (the mines move faster, the rings rotate more quickly, and the core tracks the player faster). If the player completely destroys the outermost shield ring, the cannon will create a new one. The middle ring expands to replace the lost outer ring, the inner ring replaces the middle, and a new ring emerges from the core to become the inner ring. Therefore, in order to penetrate the cannon's defenses, the player must be careful not to completely obliterate the outer ring. The three homing mines will destroy the player's ship on contact. The mines can be destroyed, but they are very small and difficult to fire on, and the player does not receive points for destroying them. Mines are revived when shield rings regenerate (some variants keep three mines churning constantly so that a new mine respawns from the core as soon as one is destroyed). As the player progresses through the levels, the mines get faster and faster, forcing the player to keep moving to avoid them. Legacy The development of the game was chronicled in an issue of the magazine Science 80. Atari programmer Howard Scott Warshaw investigated writing a clone of Star Castle for the Atari 2600, but didn't see the game as a good match for the system, technically. He reconfigured the concept into Yars' Revenge, which became Atari's top selling original game for the 2600. A hobbyist-written clone of Star Castle for the Atari 2600 was eventually released in 2012. Jim Nitchals of Cavalier Computer wrote a clone for the Apple II called Ring Raiders (referenced in-game as Raiders of the Lost Ring) (1981). Anthony Weber of Stedek Software wrote a clone for Atari 8-bit computers called Star Island (1982). In the 1986 movie Maximum Overdrive, a Star Castle machine electrocutes a person in the arcade. In 1989, a Star Castle machine appears in the background in an episode of Columbo entitled Murder, Smoke and Shadows. Rogue Synapse's Polybius (2007) is heavily based on Star Castle.

He served as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress and the Congress of the Confederation, a New York state senator, the 44th Mayor of New York City, the 1st post-colonial Mayor of New York City and a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New York. Duane was a signatory of the Continental Association and the Articles of Confederation. Early life James Duane was born February 6, 1733 in New York City, in the Province of New York, to Anthony Duane (c. 1679‚Äì1747) and his second wife, Althea Ketaltas. Anthony Duane was a Protestant Irishman from County Galway who first came to New York as an officer of the Royal Navy in 1698. In 1702 Anthony Duane left the navy to marry Eva Benson, daughter of Dirck Benson, a local merchant. They had two sons, Abraham and Cornelius. Duane prospered and bought land for investment, rental, and future development. After Eva Benson's death, Anthony married Althea Ketaltas (Hettletas), the daughter of a wealthy Dutch merchant. By the time of James' birth, his father had become a wealthy colonial settler.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p. 221 Duane's mother, Althea, died in 1736, and his father married a third time in 1741 to Margaret Riken (Rycken), the widow of Thomas Lynch of Flushing, New York. When Anthony died in 1747, James became the ward of Robert Livingston, the 3rd Lord of Livingston Manor. He completed his early education at Livingston Manor. Career Duane completed preparatory studies and read law in 1754, with James Alexander. He had an impressive command of the law and was admitted to the bar on August 3, 1754.\\"James Duane\\", Historical Society of the New York Courts He maintained a private practice in New York City from 1754 to 1762, when he became a clerk of the Chancery Court of New York. Duane was acting Attorney General of the Province of New York in 1767,Vorhees, David William. \\"Duane, James\\" in , p. 380 and a boundary commissioner in 1768 (and again in 1784), before returning to private practice in New York City in 1774 and 1775. He was a delegate to the New York Convention which ratified the United States Constitution in 1788. Duane was a member of the Federalist Party. Law practice and other activities Duane represented Trinity Church in the very protracted legal action brought by heirs of Anneke Jans, who claimed that they, and not the church, were the lawful owners of much of lower Manhattan, a tract which had been given to the church by the British crown. By the early 1770s, his practice earned him 1,400 pounds annually. At the height of his success, Duane had a house in Manhattan, one in the country, and an estate near Schenectady, New York, of and 253 tenants. He was a vestryman of Trinity Church, was appointed one of the church's nine trustees during a post-war crisis about the church's Tory-leanings,Burrows & Wallace (1999), p. 269 and was also a trustee of Kings College, the precursor to Columbia University. In 1761, Duane acquired from Gerardus Stuyvesant a farm known as Krom Mesje (\\"little crooked knife\\") in reference to a small brook that flowed into the East River. He named it \\"Gramercy Seat\\". In addition to the farm, Duane also had a house on King Street (later changed to Pine Street).Pine, John B., \\"Gramercy Park\\", Valentine's Manual of Old New York, No. 4, (Henry Collins Browne, ed.), New York. Valentine's Manual Inc., 1920, p. 194 In 1765 he was granted a patent for land in Schenectady County, which became the township of Duanesburg. With his boyhood friend James De Lancey, Duane was one of the Socialborough Proprietors, holding an area obtained by grant in 1771 and located on both sides of Otter Creek in the present towns of Pittsford and Rutland, Vermont.Flick, Alexander Clarence. New York History: Quarterly Journal of the New York State Historical Association, 1999, Volume 80; Volume 97, p. 197 American Revolution Duane was politically conservative. Until his marriage to Mary Livingston, he had been a member of James De Lancey's political faction, which while opposed to the Crown's policies, did not endorse the use of mob violence to protest British measures. His efforts to support resistance in New York led to his being chosen with others to represent the Province of New York at the Congressional meetings in Philadelphia. He remained active in both capacities. Duane was a delegate to the First Continental Congress held in Philadelphia during the autumn of 1774 in reaction to the British Navy's blockade of Boston Harbor and the passage of the Intolerable Acts by Parliament in response to the December 1773 Boston Tea Party. He was one of the many who were most disposed to reconciliation with Britain, and supported the Galloway Plan of Union, which was, however, rejected by the majority of the delegates. Upon his return to New York, he was name to the Committee of Sixty, a committee of inspection formed in the City and County of New York (Manhattan, New York City) in 1775, to enforce the Continental Association, a boycott of British goods enacted by the First Continental Congress.New-York, Committee of Correspondence. \\"The new Committee of Sixty elected\\", American Archives Series 4, Volume 1, P. 330, Northern Illinois University Libraries He was Indian Commissioner for the Province of New York in 1774, and in 1775 represented Congress as an Indian Commissioner at Albany, New York. He was a delegate to the Provincial Convention held in New York City on April 20, 1775 where delegates were elected to the Second Continental Congress. It included the delegates to the first congress and also five new members. The scope of the Provincial Convention did not extend beyond electing delegates, and they dispersed on April 22, the day before news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord arrived. The Second Continental Congress convened its first session on May 10. Duane served as a delegate from 1775 to 1781. Alexander Hamilton, as aide to Washington wrote Duane to ask him to get Congress to expedite supplies.\\"Alexander Hamilton to James Duane, 14 May 1780\\", Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History The Committee of Sixty was replaced by a more representative Committee of One Hundred on May 1, 1775. The Committee still considered itself loyal to the British Crown, but was instead opposed to the laws of the Parliament of Great Britain which they considered unconstitutional because they had no representation in it. The Committee of One Hundred was officially replaced by the New York Provincial Congress which first convened on May 23, 1775. Despite initial reservations regarding independence, he later supported the Declaration of Independence. Due to his service with the Provincial Congress, Duane was not in Philadelphia to sign the Declaration. When the British occupied New York in late summer 1776, he withdrew his wife and family to the relative safety of her father's home at Livingston Manor. He was a member of the New York Constitutional Convention which assembled at White Plains, New York, on Sunday evening, July 10, 1776 for the purpose of drafting a constitution to replace the colonial charter. In July 1778 he signed the Articles of Confederation in Philadelphia. Duane was a member of the Congress of the Confederation from 1781 to 1783. He remained active as a political leader throughout the war and returned home to Gramercy Park in 1783, commenting that his home looked \\"as if they had been inhabited by wild beasts\\".Burrows & Wallace (1999), p. 265 Post war activities He was Mayor of New York City from 1784 to 1789, appointed by the Council of Appointment.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p. 267 As Mayor, one of Duane's first acts was to donate to the poor the money usually spent on entertainment for his Inauguration ‚Äì about 20 guineas. During his time in office, he strove to help the city revive itself after the damage done by the war and the British occupation, but he was unable to maintain the city's status as the capital of the United States. As head of the Mayor's Court, he heard the landmark case of Rutgers v. Waddington, handing down a Solomonic decision which pleased neither party. After he was called before the State Assembly to explain his thinking, he was censured by that body.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p. 278 He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1782 to 1785, and from 1788 to 1790. In 1785 Duane was one of 32 prominent New Yorkers who met to create the New York Manumission Society, intended to put pressure on the state of New York to abolish slavery, as every state in the north had done except New York and New Jersey.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p. 285 He was chosen a member of the Annapolis Convention in 1786, but did not attend.

He was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 25, 1789, and received his commission on September 26, 1789. He resigned on March 17, 1794, due to ill health. Death Duane died on February 1, 1797, in Duanesburg, Schenectady County, New York.He may have died in New York City, according to his Congressional Biography.

The mainline Protestant churches (also called mainstream Protestant and sometimes oldline Protestant) are a group of Protestant denominations in the United States that contrast in history and practice with evangelical, fundamentalist, and charismatic Protestant denominations. Some make a distinction between \\"mainline\\" and \\"oldline\\", with the former referring only to denominational ties and the latter referring to church lineage, prestige and influence. However, this distinction has largely been lost to history and the terms are now nearly synonymous. These terms are also increasingly used in other countries for the same purpose of distinguishing between the so-called oldline and neo-Protestants. Mainline Protestants were a majority of Protestants in the United States until the mid-20th century. A dip in membership across all Christian denominations was more pronounced among mainline groups, with the result that mainline groups no longer comprise the majority. Mainline churches include the so-called \\"Seven Sisters of American Protestantism\\"‚Äîthe United Methodist Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Episcopal Church, the American Baptist Churches, the United Church of Christ, and the Disciples of Christ‚Äîas well as the Quakers, Reformed Church in America, African Methodist Episcopal church and other churches. The term 'mainline' has also been applied to Canadian Protestant churches that share common origins with their US counterparts. In Mexico, the Anglican Church is historically tied to and formed from the US Episcopal Church. The term is also occasionally used to refer to historic Protestant churches in Europe, Latin America, and South Africa. Mainline churches share an active approach to social issues that often leads to cooperation in organizations such as the National Council of Churches. Because of their involvement with the ecumenical movement, mainline churches are sometimes (especially outside the United States) given the alternative label of ecumenical Protestantism. These churches played a leading role in the Social Gospel movement and were active in social causes such as the civil rights movement and women's movement. As a group, the mainline churches have maintained religious doctrine that stresses social justice and personal salvation. Members of mainline denominations have played leadership roles in politics, business, science, the arts, and education. They were involved in the founding of leading institutes of higher education. Marsden argues that in the 1950s, \\"Mainline Protestant leaders were part of the liberal-moderate cultural mainstream, and their leading spokespersons were respected participants in the national conversation.\\" Some mainline Protestant denominations have the highest proportion of graduate and post-graduate degrees of any other denomination in the United States. Some also include the highest proportion of those with some college education, such as the Episcopal Church (76%), the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) (64%), and the United Church of Christ (46%), as well as the most of the American upper class. compared with the nationwide average of 50%. Episcopalians and Presbyterians also tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated than most other religious groups, and they were disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of US business and law until the 1950s. However, in the 21st Century, the majority of Episcopalians earn less than $100,000 per year. In the 1990s four of the US Supreme Court Justices were Mainline Protestants: Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens, William Rehnquist and David Souter. From 1854 until at least 1964, Mainline Protestants and their descendants were heavily Republican. In recent decades, Republicans slightly outnumber Democrats. From 1965 to 1988, mainline church membership declined from 31 million to 25 million, then fell to 21 million in 2005. While in 1970 the mainline churches claimed most Protestants and more than 30 percent of the population as members, today they are a minority among Protestants; in 2009, only 15 percent of Americans were adherents. A Pew Forum statistic revealed the same share in 2014. Terminology The term mainline Protestant was coined during debates between modernists and fundamentalists in the 1920s. Several sources claim that the term is derived from the Philadelphia Main Line, a group of affluent suburbs of Philadelphia; most residents belonged to mainline denominations.Lindsay, D. Michael. \\"Faith in the Halls of Power\\" Today, most mainline Protestants remain rooted in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. C. Kirk Hadaway and Penny Long Marler define the term as follows: \\"the term 'mainline Protestant' is used along with 'mainstream Protestant' and 'oldline Protestant' to categorize denominations that are affiliated with the National Council of Churches and have deep historical roots in and long-standing influence on American society.\\" In the US, Protestantism is generally divided between mainline denominations and evangelical or conservative denominations. In other parts of the world, the term mainline Protestant is not used. Instead, the term \\"ecumenical\\" is used to distinguish similar churches from evangelical denominations. Some have criticized the term mainline for its alleged ethnocentric and elitist assumptions, since it almost exclusively described white, non-fundamentalist Protestant Americans from its origin to the late twentieth century. Mainline vs. mainstream The term mainstream Christian in academic usage is not equivalent to mainline Protestant and is often used as an attempt to find impartial sociological vocabulary in distinguishing orthodoxy and heresy. Hence in Christological and doctrinal reference mainstream Christianity is often equivalent to Trinitarianism. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the term mainline Protestant is not used, and mainstream does not mean progressive Protestant.

Some denominations with similar names and historical ties to mainline groups are not considered mainline. The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS), the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA;), the Churches of Christ and Christian churches, the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), the North American Lutheran Church (NALC), and the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) are often considered too conservative for this category and thus grouped as evangelical. *The National Association of Congregational Christian Churches is considered to be evangelical by Pew Research while the Association of Religion Data Archives considered it to be mainline. Theology Variation Mainline Protestantism is characterized by theological and ideological pluralism. While doctrinal standards and confessional statements exist, these are not usually interpreted in ways to exclude people from membership. Richard Hutcheson, Jr., chairman of the Office of Review and Evaluation of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, observed that clergy candidates were more likely to be rejected due to \\"excessive narrowness\\" than for violating confessional standards. Mainline churches hold a range of theological orientations‚Äîconservative, moderate and liberal. About half of mainline Protestants describe themselves as liberal. Mainline Christian groups are often more accepting of other beliefs and faiths, affirm the ordination of women, and have become increasingly affirming of gay ordination. Nearly one- third of mainline Protestants call themselves conservative, and most local mainline congregations have a strong, active conservative element.Struckmeyer, Kurt. \\"Mainline Christianity. \\" Following Jesus Web: 13 Dec 2009 Mainline denominations are historically Trinitarian and proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and Son of God. In practice, mainline churches tend to be theologically moderate and influenced by higher criticism, an approach used by scholars to separate the Bible's earliest historical elements from perceived later additions and intentional distortions. Mainline denominations generally teach that the Bible is God's Word in function, but that it must be interpreted both through the lens of the cultures in which it was originally written, and examined using God-given reason. A 2008 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that only 22 percent of the 7,500 mainline Christians surveyed said the Bible is God's Word and is to be interpreted as literally true, word for word. Thirty-eight percent thought that the Bible is God's Word but is not to be taken literally, word for word. Twenty-eight percent said the Bible was not the Word of God but was of human origin. It has been noted, even by members of mainline churches, that the leadership of denominational agencies and bureaucracies has often been more theologically and socially liberal than the overall membership of the mainline churches. This gap has caused feelings of alienation among conservative mainline Protestants. This dissatisfaction has led to the formation of various Confessing Movements or charismatic renewal movements which are more conservative in tone. Social justice The mainline denominations emphasize the biblical concept of justice, stressing the need for Christians to work for social justice, which usually involve politically liberal approaches to social and economic problems. Early in the 20th century, they actively supported the Social Gospel. Mainline churches were basically pacifistic before 1940, but under the influence of people such as Reinhold Niebuhr they supported World War II and the Cold War. They have been far from uniform in their reaction to issues of gender and sexuality, though they tend to be more accepting than the Catholic Church or the more conservative Protestant churches. Social issues Harvard College, a favorite choice of American upper classes. Having a college degree is common among mainline Protestant denominations, especially Episcopalians and Presbyterians. Many mainline denominations are active in voicing perspectives on social issues. Almost all mainline denominations are gender-inclusive and ordain women. On reproductive health issues, the Episcopal Church (TEC), Presbyterian Church (USA) (PCUSA), Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA), and United Church of Christ (UCC) are members of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. The United Methodist Church (UMC) and Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) support exceptions, when abortion may be necessary, but do not endorse the procedure. Other denominations, such as the Church of the Brethren and Mennonite Church USA, are against abortion. Regarding human sexuality, TEC, the ELCA, PC(USA), Society of Friends (Quaker), UUA, and UCC recognize same-gender marriages. Also considered mainline, the Anglican Church of Canada, Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and United Church of Canada bless or marry same-gender couples. In 2015, the Mennonite Church Canada saw its first same-gender marriage in one of its congregations. The American Baptist Churches USA does not perform same- gender marriages, but allows each congregation the freedom to decide for itself. Including the aforementioned denominations, the Mennonite Church USA, Metropolitan Community Church, and Moravian Church Northern Province license or ordain openly gay clergy. While the UMC does not nationally ordain gay or lesbian clergy, the New York Annual Conference, a regional body of the UMC, has ordained the denomination's first openly gay and lesbian clergy. The Western Jurisdiction of the UMC also elected the denomination's first openly gay bishop. Some congregations of the Church of the Brethren have also voted to perform same-gender marriages although the national denomination opposes this practice. Most of the above denominations also ordain openly transgender clergy. While the national church has not approved of gay or lesbian clergy, the UMC has allowed transgender pastors. Politically, mainline churches are also active. While no particular candidate can be endorsed, mainline churches often invite political speakers. At the 2016 General Conference for the African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historically Black denomination but also identified as mainline, Hillary Clinton was invited to offer an address for the delegates and clergy. Statistical decline The term \\"mainline\\" once implied a certain numerical majority or dominant presence in mainstream society, but that is no longer the case. Protestant churches as a whole have slowly declined in total membership since the 1960s. As the national population has grown these churches have shrunk from 63% of the population in 1970 to 54% by 2000, and 48% in 2012, ceasing to be the religious category for the majority of Americans. This statistic may be inaccurate due to the number of former or historically mainline Protestants who continue to espouse mainline Protestant values without active church attendance. American affiliation with mainline denominations declined from 55% of all Protestants in 1973 to 46% in 1998. The number of mainline congregations in the U. S. declined from more than 80,000 churches in the 1950s to about 72,000 in 2008.Report Examines the State of Mainline Protestant Churches The Barna Group. December 7, 2009. Web: 12 Dec. 2009 Various causes of mainline decline in population have been cited. Much analysis has taken place both from those within and outside mainline denominations. Key factors indicate that all types of churches can and do grow, regardless of hymnody or contemporary music, type of liturgy, average age of worshiper, or location On average, however, churches in rural areas, churches with older congregants, and churches with fewer young people involved struggle most to add members and grow churches. For example, of all churches founded since 1993, 54% are experiencing growth, while that is true for only 28% of congregations founded prior to 1900. As demographics change, the churches founded by earlier generations often struggle to adapt to changing conditions, including the declines or shifts in the age and ethnicity of local populations. Says David Roozen, Director of Hartford Seminary's Hartford Institute for Religion Research, \\"Location, Location, Location used to be the kind way that researchers described the extent to which the growth or decline of American congregations was captive to the demographic changes going on in their immediate neighborhoods.\\" Age demographics cannot be overlooked as a real factor in congregational decline, with the birthrate for mainline Protestants well below what is needed to maintain membership numbers. The Barna Group, an Evangelical surveyor, has noted, Protestant pastors who serve mainline churches serve on average half as long as Protestant pastors in non-mainline churches. This may contribute to decline and may be influenced in part by the United Methodist Church practice of Itinerancy, where clergy are intentionally moved from one church to another as often as yearly in an effort to support and encourage the United Methodist tradition of strong lay ministry. Mainline churches have also had difficulty attracting minorities, particularly Hispanics. Hispanics comprise 6 percent of the mainline population but 16 percent of the US population. According to the Barna Group report, the failure of mainline Protestants to add substantial numbers of Hispanics is portent for the future, given both the rapid increase of the Hispanic population as well as the outflow of Hispanics from Catholicism to Protestant churches in the past decade, most of whom are selecting evangelical or Pentecostal Protestant churches. In general, however, decline can be a difficult thing to statistically quantify. Many older Protestant churches lived a vibrant lifetime and continue to evidence vital ministry and faith regardless of declining populations or birthrates. For example, giving and engagement with need and justice, both indicators of strong Christian faith, have increased despite the aging and loss of congregational members. Contrast with other Protestant denominations While various Protestant denominations have experienced declining membership, the most pronounced changes have occurred among mainline churches. Demographic trends for evangelical and historically African-American churches have been more stable. According to the Pew Research Center, mainline churches could claim 14.7 percent of all US adults compared to 25.4 percent who belonged to evangelical churches in 2014.Chang, Perry. \\"Recent Changes in Membership and Attendance. \\" Presbyterian Church (U. S. A.) Nov. 2006. Web: Presbyterian Church (U. S. A.) Demographers Hout, Greeley, and Wilde have attributed the long-term decline in mainline membership and the concomitant growth in the conservative Protestant denominations to four basic causes: birth rates; switching to conservative denominations; departure from Protestantism to \\"no religion\\" (i.e. secularization); and conversions from non-Protestant sources. In their analysis, by far the main cause is birth rates‚Äîlow for the mainline bodies, and high for the conservatives. The second most important factor is that fewer conservatives switch to mainline denominations than before. Despite speculation to the contrary, Hout, Greeley, and Wilde argue that switching from a mainline to a conservative denomination is not important in accounting for the trend, because it is fairly constant over the decades. Finally, conservative denominations have had a greater inflow of converts. Their analysis gives no support for the notion that theological or social conservatism or liberalism has much impact on long-term growth trends. Evidence from the General Social Survey indicates that higher fertility and earlier childbearing among women from conservative denominations explains 76% of the observed trend: conservative denominations have grown their own. Mainline denomination members have the lowest birthrate among American Christian groups. Unless there is a surge of new members, rising death rates are predicted to diminish their ranks even further in the years ahead. =Trends= Forest Hills, Queens in New York City area is an affluent area with a population of wealthy mainline Protestants Some other findings of the Barna Group: * From 1958 to 2008, mainline church membership dropped by more than one-quarter to roughly 20 million people‚Äî15 percent of all American adults. * From 1998 to 2008, there was a 22 percent drop in the percentage of adults attending mainline congregations who have children under the age of 18 living in their home. * In 2009, nearly 40 percent of mainline church attendees were single. This increase has been driven higher by a rise in the number of divorced and widowed adherents. * From 1998 to 2008, volunteerism dropped 21 percent; adult Sunday school participation decreased 17 percent. * The average age of a mainline pastor in 1998 was 48 and increased to 55 by 2009. * Pastors on average remain with a congregation for four years compared to twice that length for non-mainline church leaders. Recent statistics from the Pew Forum provide additional explanations for the decline. * Evangelical church members are younger than those in mainline denominations. Fourteen percent of evangelical congregations are between 18 and 29 (compared to 2 percent), 36 percent between 30 and 49, 28 percent between 50 and 64, and 23 percent 65 or older. Not paralleling the decline in membership is the household income of members of mainline denominations. Overall, it is higher than that of evangelicals: * 25% reported less than a $30,000 income per year. * 21% reported $30,000‚Äì$49,999 per year. * 18% reported $50,000‚Äì$74,999 per year. * 15% reported $75,000‚Äì$99,999 per year. * 21% reported an income of $100,000 per year or more, compared to only 13 percent of evangelicals. History Old Ship Church, an old Puritan meetinghouse currently used by a Unitarian Universalist congregation While the term \\"mainline\\" was not applied to churches until the 20th century, mainline churches trace their history to the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. The largest and most influential Protestant denominations in Britain's 13 colonies were the Anglicans (after the American Revolution called Episcopalians) and the Congregationalists (from which the Unitarians would later split). These were later surpassed in size and influence by the evangelical denominations: the Baptists, Presbyterians and Methodists. Sharing a common Reformation heritage with Episcopal and Congregational churches, these denominations together created the mainline. It was, according to historian Jason Lantzer, \\"the emerging evangelical movement that would help forge the Seven Sisters and which provides a core to the wide variety of theological and doctrinal differences, shaping them into a more coherent whole.\\" The Great Awakening ignited controversy within Protestant churches between Old Lights and New Lights (or Old Side and New Side among Presbyterians). Led by figures such as the Congregationalist minister Charles Chauncy, Old Lights opposed the evangelical revivalism at the heart of the Awakening, while New Lights, led by fellow Congregationalist minister Jonathan Edwards, supported the revivals and argued for the importance of having a conversion experience. By the 1800s, Chauncy's followers had drifted toward forms of theological liberalism, such as Universalism, Unitarianism and Transcendentalism. Lady Chapel in Church of the Good Shepherd, a 19th-Century Anglo-Catholic Episcopal Church in Pennsylvania The Second Great Awakening would inaugurate a period of evangelical dominance within American mainline Protestantism that would last over a century. The Second Great Awakening was a catalyst for the reform of society. Efforts to improve the rights of women, reforming prisons, establishing free public schools, prohibiting alcohol, and (in the North) abolishing slavery were promoted by mainline churches. After the Civil War, however, tensions between evangelicals and non-evangelicals would re-emerge. As the practice of historical criticism spread to the United States, conflict over biblical inspiration erupted within Protestant churches. Conservative Protestants led by A. A. Hodge, B. B. Warfield and other Princeton theologians argued for biblical inerrancy, while liberal theologians such as Charles A. Briggs of Union Theological Seminary were open to using historical criticism to understand the Bible. As 19th‚Äìcentury evangelicals embraced dispensational premillennialism and retreated from society in the face of mounting social problems caused by industrialization, urbanization and immigration, liberal Protestants embraced the Social Gospel, which worked for the \\"regeneration of society\\" rather than only the conversion of individuals. The Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy of the 1920s widened the division between evangelical and non-evangelical Protestants as the two sides fought for control over the mainline denominations. The fundamentalists lost these battles for control to the modernists or liberals. Since the 1920s, mainline churches have been associated with liberal Protestantism. Episcopalians and Presbyterian WASPs tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated than most other religious groups in America,Irving Lewis Allen, \\"WASP‚ÄîFrom Sociological Concept to Epithet,\\" Ethnicity, 1975 154+ and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business, law and politics, and for many years were especially dominant the Republican Party. Numbers of the wealthiest and most affluent American families, such as the Vanderbilts and Astors, Rockefeller, who were Baptists, Du Pont, Roosevelt, Forbes, Whitneys, the Morgans and Harrimans are Episcopalian and Presbyterian families. Through the 1940s and 1950s, neo-orthodoxy had become the prevailing theological approach within the mainline churches. This neo- orthodox consensus, however, gave way to resurgent liberal theologies in the 1960s and to liberation theology during the 1970s.

It is found patchily distributed across much of the mainland of the Indian Subcontinent but absent in the arid zones of India. It is easily recognized by the tuft of feathers on its forehead that form a frontal crest, a feature also found in the closely related Javan myna and the pale-bellied myna which were treated as a subspecies in the past. The eyes are pale, yellow or blue depending on the population and the base of the orange-yellow bill is dark. It has also been introduced either intentionally or accidentally into many other parts of the world including Fiji, Taiwan, the Andaman Islands, and parts of Japan. The species has also spread out on its own to some islands in the Pacific. Description Jungle mynas are long and have grey plumage, darker on the head and wings. The sexes are indistinguishable in plumage. A large white wing patches on the base of the primaries becomes conspicuous in flight, and the tail feathers are broadly tipped in white. There is a tuft of feathers on the forehead arising at the base of the bill. The bill and legs are bright yellow, and there is no bare skin around eye as in the common myna and the bank myna. The base of the beak is dark in adults with a shade of blue at the base of the lower mandible. The southern Indian population has a blue iris. The northeastern Indian populations have a smoky dark belly and vent. Juveniles are browner with a pale throat and along the median of the underside. Abnormal leucistic plumages have been recorded. A. f. mahrattensis with blue iris The calls of the jungle myna are higher pitched than those of the common myna. Foraging flocks make clipped cheeping contact calls. The jungle myna is part of the Acridotheres clade which is thought to have speciated in the late Pliocene and Pleistocene Periods. Unlike the starlings in the genus Sturnus, they do not have well-developed adaptations including the musculature required for prying or open bill probing (which need muscles to open the beak apart forcefully). The nominate population A. f. fuscus was described from Bengal by Wagler as Pastor fuscus in 1827. It has a pale creamy vent. This population with a yellow iris extends south of the Brahmaputra into Burma and the Malay Peninsula. A. f. fumidus of eastern India, mainly east of the Brahmaputra in Assam and Nagaland (although movements are known), was described by Sidney Dillon Ripley in 1950, although he placed it as a subspecies of cristatellus based on the prevailing treatment of the time. It has a darker smoky grey vent and can appear similar to the syntopic great myna, but the latter is darker and does not have a pale iris.. The peninsular Indian population mahrattensis described by W.H. Sykes in 1832 is identifiable by the blue iris. The population in the Malay Peninsula, torquatus, was described by W.R. Davison in 1892. It has a white throat and a half-collar extending around the neck. The species has a diploid chromosome number of 74 (80 in the common myna). Distribution and habitat The white of the base of the primaries and the tips of the tail are visible in flight The jungle myna is a common resident breeder in tropical southern Asia from Nepal, Bangladesh, India. Subspecies fuscus is found across northern India west from Mount Abu, east to Puri in Orissa. It has also been introduced into the Andaman Islands and Fiji where it was introduced around 1890 to control insect pests in sugarcane. They have expanded on their own into some Pacific Islands such as Niuafo'ou where they are a threat to native bird species such as lories (Vini) with whom they compete especially for nest holes. In many parts of Asia, they are kept as pets and feral populations have established in many places such as in Taiwan. Breeding populations have established in Japan and Western Samoa. The population torquatus of Malaysia is on the decline and is possibly being outcompeted by Javan mynas with which it form hybrids. This common passerine is typically found in forest and cultivation and often close to open water. They may disperse outside their range particularly after the breeding season.  Behaviour and ecology  Foraging while perched on a water buffalo along with a black drongo in West Bengal Jungle mynas are omnivorous feed mainly on insects, fruit and seeds, for which they forage mainly on the ground often in the company of other myna species. They also take berries from low bushes such as Lantana and take nectar from large flowers borne on trees such as Erythrina (which they may also pollinate with their tuft feathers acting as brushes) and water collected in the flowers of introduced trees such Spathodea campanulata. They also perch on large grazing mammals, picking ectoparasites off their bodies, and capturing insects that may be disturbed into flight from vegetation. Flocks may also follow farmers in fields that are being ploughed. They also forage on kitchen waste in urban areas. They may take larger prey including small mice to feed their young. In Fiji, they have been noticed anting using a millipede. The breeding season is in summer and before the rains, February to May in southern India and April to July in northern India. They are secondary cavity nesters, using both holes in trees and in man-made constructions such as walls, embankments, and in houses from 2 to 6 metres above the ground. As secondary tree hole nesters, they compete with other hole-nesters. They have also been recorded using the axils of fronds of palm trees in Malaysia. They sometimes use sloughed snake skins to line the inside of the nest hole. In the Himalayan foothills, they use dry pine needles to line the nest. The usual clutch consists of 4 to 6 turquoise blue eggs. Both sexes take part in nest building, incubation and feeding the young. They roost communally along with other mynas, sometimes in sugarcane fields and reed beds. Species of Haemoproteus are known from the blood of mynas and they have also been found to host Plasmodium circumflexum when artificially infected in the lab. Other parasites that have been found in the jungle myna include Dorisa aethiopsaris in the intestine.

It is part of the Isigny-Omaha Intercom communaut√© de communes, the 59 communes of which have a combined population of 27,181. Geography and economy Situated in the fertile grassland region ‚Äì known as the Baie des Veys ‚Äì which constitutes the joint estuary of four rivers, Isigny is an important centre of the dairy industry. The town is famous for its AOC butter and cream, as well as for the production of Mimolette, Pont-l'√âv√™que, Camembert, and Tr√©sor d'Isigny cheeses, among others, made by the Isigny Sainte-M√®re co-operative. Oysters have been extensively cultivated in the nearby waters of the Baie des Veys since the mid 20th century. A major river, the Vire, passes through the commune. History A dairy in Isigny sur Mer around 1900 The town is well positioned and owes its significance to its industrial history. The industrialisation of milk processing began at the start of the 19th century: many factories were built, especially by the Dupont d'Isigny family, which then diversified and created the famous Isigny caramels. More recently, the co-operative Isigny dairy has dominated. Meanwhile, the agricultural fairs and markets have also contributed to Isigny's reputation. The d'Isigny family traces back to before the Norman conquest of England, and William The Conqueror (1028‚Äì82) had military commanders named d'Isigny. In 1924 Isigny was renamed Isigny-sur-Mer. The port was important in facilitating inshore navigation, allowing commercial and industrial activity to be developed and maintained (import of wood from the North; export coal from the mine at Littry and butter). Fishing was important until the end of the 1970s (mussel fishing and small vessels crewed by fishermen from the Hogues quarter). The famous \\"Ca√Øeu d'Isigny\\" is a hymn to Isigny's sailors and fishermen, created in 1869 by Alfred Rossel (1841‚Äì1926). Isigny was more than 60% destroyed by two bombardments on 8 June 1944 and has since been almost entirely rebuilt. Isigny played its part in the D-Day landings: Twenty small Dutch schuyts were employed by the Americans to bring stores and equipment inland from the larger cargo ships that were moored off- shore. Charles de Gaulle paid its inhabitants visits on 14 June 1944 and 16 June 1946. The Disney surname is derived from the town. The earliest known ancestor of Walt Disney, with a similar name, was Jean-Christophe d'Isigny (\\"of Isigny\\"), the branch settled in what is today called Norton Disney in England. The name Isigny is said to derive from \\"Fire of Isis\\", the Graeco- Egyptian goddess who was once worshipped in the area, or, alternatively, from the submerged lost city of Ys, said to be nearby.https://www.isigny-sur- mer.fr/tourisme-et-loisirs/le-nom-disigny-et-son-histoire.html It is possible that Isigny may have been the site of a smaller-scale lighthouse built on the model of the Lighthouse of Alexandria in Egypthttps://www.oldest.org/structures/lighthouse/ and the geography of Isigny would seem to be favorable for such a coastal construction. On 1 January 2017 the commune was extended by being merged with the former communes of Castilly, Neuilly-la-For√™t, Les Oubeaux, and Vouilly.

Population  Economy  Isigny is famous for local products made from milk, such as butter and cream and caramels. Several agro-food companies manufacture these products, including Isigny-Sainte-M√®re (butter and cream) and Dupont d'Isigny (caramels).

Walsh (March 11, 1887December 31, 1980) was an American film director, actor, founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), and the brother of silent screen actor George Walsh. He was known for portraying John Wilkes Booth in the silent classic The Birth of a Nation (1915) and for directing such films as The Big Trail (1930), starring John Wayne, High Sierra (1941), starring Ida Lupino and Humphrey Bogart, and White Heat (1949), starring James Cagney and Edmond O'Brien. He directed his last film in 1964. Biography Walsh was born in New York as Albert Edward Walsh to Elizabeth T. Bruff, the daughter of Irish Catholic immigrants, and Thomas W. Walsh, an Englishman. Walsh was part of Omega Gamma Delta in high school, as was his younger brother. Growing up in New York, Walsh was also a friend of the Barrymore family. John Barrymore recalled spending time reading in the Walsh family library as a youth. Later in life he lived in Palm Springs, California. He was buried at Assumption Cemetery Simi Valley, Ventura County, California. Film career Walsh was educated at Seton Hall College. He began acting in 1909, first as a stage actor in New York City and later as a film actor. In 1914 he became an assistant to D. W. Griffith and made his first full-length feature film, The Life of General Villa, shot on location in Mexico with Pancho Villa playing the lead and with actual ongoing battles filmed in progress as well as recreations. Walsh as John Wilkes Booth Walsh played John Wilkes Booth in Griffith's epic The Birth of a Nation (1915) and also served as an assistant director. This was followed by the critically acclaimed Regeneration in 1915, possibly the earliest feature gangster film, shot on location in Manhattan's Bowery district. Walsh served as an officer in the United States Army during World War I. He later directed The Thief of Bagdad (1924), starring Douglas Fairbanks and Anna May Wong, and Laurence Stallings' What Price Glory? (1926), starring Victor McLaglen and Dolores del R√≠o. Stallings (left) and Walsh (center) c. 1926 In Sadie Thompson (1928), starring Gloria Swanson as a prostitute seeking a new life in Samoa, Walsh starred as Swanson's boyfriend in his first acting role since 1915; he also directed the film. He was then hired to direct and star in In Old Arizona, a film about O. Henry's character the Cisco Kid. While on location for that film Walsh was in a car crash when a jackrabbit jumped through the windshield as he was driving through the desert; he lost his right eye as a result. He gave up the part and never acted again. Warner Baxter won an Oscar for the role Walsh was originally slated to play. Walsh would wear an eyepatch for the rest of his life. In the early days of sound with Fox, Walsh directed the first widescreen spectacle, The Big Trail (1930), an epic wagon train western shot on location across the West. The movie starred John Wayne, then unknown, whom Walsh discovered as prop boy Marion Morrison and renamed after the Revolutionary War general Mad Anthony Wayne; Walsh happened to be reading a book about him at the time. Walsh directed The Bowery (1933), featuring Wallace Beery, George Raft, Fay Wray and Pert Kelton; the energetic movie recounts the story of Steve Brodie (Raft), supposedly the first man to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge and live to brag about it. An undistinguished period followed with Paramount Pictures from 1935 to 1939, but Walsh's career rose to new heights after he moved to Warner Brothers, with The Roaring Twenties (1939), featuring James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart; Dark Command (1940), with John Wayne and Roy Rogers (at Republic Pictures); They Drive By Night (1940), with George Raft, Ann Sheridan, Ida Lupino and Bogart; High Sierra (1941), with Lupino and Bogart again; They Died with Their Boots On (1941), with Errol Flynn as Custer; The Strawberry Blonde (1941), with Cagney and Olivia de Havilland; Manpower (1941), with Edward G. Robinson, Marlene Dietrich and George Raft; and White Heat (1949), with Cagney. Walsh's contract at Warners expired in 1953. He directed several films afterwards, including three with Clark Gable: The Tall Men (1955), The King and Four Queens (1956) and Band of Angels (1957). Walsh retired in 1964. He died of a heart attack in 1980. Some of Walsh's film-related material and personal papers are contained in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives.

The first creation came in 1627 in favour of Emanuel Scrope, 12th Baron Scrope of Bolton. The earldom became extinct on his death in 1630 while the barony became either extinct or dormant (see Baron Scrope of Bolton for more information on this title). The second creation came in 1643 in favour of the Royalist soldier Henry Spencer, 3rd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton. The Spencer family descended from Sir John Spencer (d. 1522) who acquired the Wormleighton estate in Warwickshire and the Althorp estate in Northamptonshire. His grandson Sir John Spencer (d. 1586) was a Knight of the Shire for Northamptonshire. The latter's grandson Sir Robert Spencer represented Brackley in Parliament in the late 16th century. In 1603 Sir Robert was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Spencer of Wormleighton. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, William, the second Baron. He had previously represented Northamptonshire in Parliament. His eldest son was the aforementioned third Baron. In July 1643 he was created Earl of Sunderland in the Peerage of England. Lord Sunderland was killed at the Battle of Newbury in September of the same year. He was succeeded by his two-year-old only son, Robert, the second Earl. He later gained great distinction as a statesman and notably served four times as Secretary of State for the Southern Department. His eldest surviving son, Charles, the third Earl, also gained prominence as a statesman. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Privy Seal, Secretary of State for both the Northern and Southern Departments, Lord President of the Council and First Lord of the Treasury. However, his political career was ruined by the South Sea Bubble of 1720. Lord Sunderland married as his second wife Lady Anne Churchill, second daughter of the distinguished soldier John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and Sarah Jennings. The dukedom of Marlborough was allowed to descend to the Duke's daughters and their sons after a special Act of Parliament was passed in 1716. Sunderland was succeeded by his eldest surviving son by his second wife, Robert, the fourth Earl. He died unmarried in 1729 at the age of 27 and was succeeded by his younger brother, Charles, the fifth Earl. In 1733 he succeeded his maternal aunt Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough as third Duke of Marlborough. The barony of Spencer of Wormleighton and earldom of Sunderland have remained subsidiary titles of the dukedom ever since. Earl of Sunderland has been used as the courtesy title by the Duke's grandson. The Honourable John Spencer, fourth son of the third Earl of Sunderland by his second wife, succeeded to the family estates in Northamptonshire in 1733 after his elder brother inherited the dukedom of Marlborough. His son John was created Earl Spencer in 1765. The Honourable Robert Spencer, second son of the second Baron, was created Viscount Teviot in 1685.

It is a delta modulation with variable step size (i.e., special case of adaptive delta modulation), first proposed by Greefkes and Riemens in 1970. CVSD encodes at 1 bit per sample, so that audio sampled at 16 kHz is encoded at 16 kbit/s. The encoder maintains a reference sample and a step size. Each input sample is compared to the reference sample. If the input sample is larger, the encoder emits a 1 bit and adds the step size to the reference sample. If the input sample is smaller, the encoder emits a 0 bit and subtracts the step size from the reference sample. The encoder also keeps the previous N bits of output (N = 3 or N = 4 are very common) to determine adjustments to the step size; if the previous N bits are all 1s or 0s, the step size is increased. Otherwise, the step size is decreased (usually in an exponential manner, with \\\\tau being in the range of 5 ms). The step size is adjusted for every input sample processed. To allow for bit errors to fade out and to allow (re)synchronization to an ongoing bitstream, the output register (which keeps the reference sample) is normally realized as a leaky integrator with a time constant (\\\\tau) of about 1 ms. The decoder reverses this process, starting with the reference sample, and adding or subtracting the step size according to the bit stream. The sequence of adjusted reference samples are the reconstructed waveform, and the step size is adjusted according to the same all-1s-or-0s logic as in the encoder. Adaptation of step size allows one to avoid slope overload (step of quantization increases when the signal rapidly changes) and decreases granular noise when the signal is constant (decrease of step of quantisation). CVSD is sometimes called a compromise between simplicity, low bitrate, and quality. Common bitrates are 9.6‚Äì128 kbit/s. Like other delta-modulation techniques, the output of the decoder does not exactly match the original input to the encoder.  Applications  12 kbit/s CVSD is used by Motorola's SECURENET line of digitally encrypted two- way radio products. 16 and 32 kbit/s CVSD were used by military TRI-TAC digital telephones (DNVT, DSVT) for use in deployed areas to provide voice recognition quality audio. 16 kbit/s rates were typically used by US Army forces to conserve bandwidth over tactical links. 32 kbit/s rates were typically used by US Air Force forces for improved voice quality. 64 kbit/s CVSD is one of the options to encode voice signals in telephony-related Bluetooth service profiles; e.g., between mobile phones and wireless headsets. The other options are PCM with logarithmic a-law or Œº-law quantization. Numerous arcade games, such as Sinistar and Smash TV, and pinball machines, such as Gorgar or Space Shuttle, play pre-recorded speech through an HC-55516 CVSD decoder.Williams/Midway Y-Unit games SBS application 24 kbit/s delta modulation Delta modulation was used by Satellite Business Systems or SBS for its voice ports to provide long-distance phone service to large domestic corporations with a significant inter-corporation communications need (such as IBM). This system was in service throughout the 1980s. The voice ports used digitally implemented 24 kbit/s delta modulation with voice activity compression (VAC) and echo suppressors to control the half second echo path through the satellite. Listening tests were conducted to verify that the 24 kbit/s Delta Modulator achieved \\"full voice quality\\" with no discernible degradation as compared to a high quality phone line or the standard 64 kbit/s Œº-law companded PCM. This provided an 8:3 improvement in satellite channel capacity. IBM developed the Satellite Communications Controller and the voice port functions. The original proposal in 1974 used a state-of-the-art 24 kbit/s Delta Modulator with a single integrator and a Shindler compander modified for gain error recovery. This proved to have less than full phone line speech quality. In 1977, one engineer with two assistants in the IBM Research Triangle Park, NC laboratory was assigned to improve the quality. The final implementation replaced the integrator with a predictor implemented with a two-pole complex-pair low-pass filter designed to approximate the long-term average speech spectrum. The theory was that ideally the integrator should be a predictor designed to match the signal spectrum. A nearly perfect Shindler compander replaced the modified version. It was found the modified compander resulted in a less than perfect step size at most signal levels and the fast gain error recovery increased the noise as determined by actual listening tests as compared to simple signal to noise measurements. The final compander achieved a very mild gain error recovery due to the natural truncation rounding error caused by 12-bit arithmetic. The complete function of delta modulation, VAC, and echo control for 6 ports was implemented in a single digital integrated circuit chip with 12-bit arithmetic. A single DAC was shared by all 6 ports providing voltage compare functions for the modulators and feeding sample and hold circuits for the demodulator outputs. A single card held the chip, DAC, and all the analog circuits for the phone line interface including transformers.  See also  * Pulse-width modulation * Delta-sigma modulation  References  * J. A.

It is generally a short-lived tree with a lifespan comparable to that of humans, although there are some specimens known to be over 250 years old. The species is native to northern China and Indiahttp://old.worldagroforestry.org/treedb2/AFTPDFS/Morus_alba.PDF, and is widely cultivated and naturalized elsewhere (United States, Mexico, Australia, Kyrgyzstan, Argentina, Turkey, Iran, etc.).Suttie, J. M. (undated). FAO Report: Morus alba L.Atlas of Living Australia, Morus alba L., White MulberrySEINet, Southwestern Biodiversity, Arizona chapter photos, description, distribution map The white mulberry is widely cultivated to feed the silkworms employed in the commercial production of silk. It is also notable for the rapid release of its pollen, which is launched at over half the speed of sound. Its berries are edible when ripe. Description On young, vigorous shoots, the leaves may be up to long, and deeply and intricately lobed, with the lobes rounded. On older trees, the leaves are generally long, unlobed, cordate at the base and rounded to acuminate at the tip, and serrated on the margins. The trees are generally deciduous in temperate regions, but trees grown in tropical regions can be evergreen. The flowers are single-sex catkins; male catkins are long, and female catkins long. Male and female flowers are usually on separate trees although they may occur on the same tree.Schaffner, John H. 1919. The nature of the diecious condition in Morus alba and Salix amygdaloides. Ohio Journal of Science 18: 101-125.Purdue University. Center for New Crops & Plant Products. NewCROP: Morus alba. The fruit is long; in the species in the wild it is deep purple, but in many cultivated plants it varies from white to pink; it is sweet but bland, unlike the more intense flavor of the red mulberry and black mulberry. The seeds are widely dispersed in the droppings of birds that eat the fruit.Bean, W. J. (1978). Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles. John Murray . The white mulberry is scientifically notable for the rapid plant movement involved in pollen release from its catkins. The stamens act as catapults, releasing stored elastic energy in just 25 ¬µs. The resulting movement is approximately , about half the speed of sound, making it the fastest known movement in the plant kingdom. Taxonomy Two varieties of Morus alba are recognized: * Morus alba var. alba * Morus alba var. multicaulis Cultivation Leaf variation Morus alba flowers in India Cultivation of white mulberry for silkworms began over four thousand years ago in China. In 2002, 6,260 km2 of land were devoted to the species in China. The species is now extensively planted and widely naturalized throughout the warm temperate world. It has been grown widely from the Indian subcontinent west through Afghanistan and Iran to southern Europe for over a thousand years for leaves to feed silkworms. More recently, it has become widely naturalized in disturbed areas such as roadsides and the edges of tree lots, along with urban areas in much of North America, where it hybridizes readily with the locally native red mulberry (Morus rubra). There is now serious concern for the long- term genetic viability of the red mulberry because of extensive hybridization in some areas.Burgess, K.S., Morgan, M., Deverno, L., & Husband, B. C. (2005). Asymmetrical introgression between two Morus species (M. alba, M. rubra) that differ in abundance. Molec. Ecol. 14: 3471‚Äì3483. Uses Mulberry leaves placed on trays with silkworms (Liang Kai's Sericulture c. 1200s) Ppongnip-cha (mulberry leaf tea) White mulberry leaves are the preferred feedstock for silkworms, and are also cut for food for livestock (cattle, goats, etc.) in areas where dry seasons restrict the availability of ground vegetation. The leaves are prepared as tea in Korea. The fruit are also eaten, often dried or made into wine. For landscaping, a fruitless mulberry was developed from a clone for use in the production of silk in the U.S. The industry never materialized, but the mulberry variety is now used as an ornamental tree where shade is desired without the fruit.Howstuffworks.com A weeping cultivar of white mulberry, Morus alba 'Pendula', is a popular ornamental plant. The species has become a popular lawn tree across the desert cities of the southwestern United States, prized for its shade and also for its cylindrical berry clusters composed of sweet, purplish-white fruits. The plant's pollen has become problematical in some cities where it has been blamed for an increase in hay fever.Pollen Library, White Mulberry (Morus alba)Thermo Scientific, University of Arizona Cooperative Extension, Yavapai County, Plants That May Cause Allergies in Yavapai County Medicinal Various extracts from Morus alba including kuwanon G, moracin M, steppogenin-4‚Ä≤-O-Œ≤-D- glucoside and mulberroside A have been suggested as having a variety of potentially-useful medical effects.\\"Kuwanon G: an antibacterial agent from the root bark of Morus alba against oral pathogens\\"Hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects of mulberry (Morus alba L.) fruit in hyperlipidaemia rats Yang X., Yang L., Zheng H.

In modern times, when someone talks about living in a city, they are in an area with many surrounding people and buildings, generally quite tall ones. In archaeological terms, cities give great information because of the infrastructure they have and amounts of people that were around one another. Through the years there has been one big method used for Urban archaeology along with significant historic developments. Humans produce waste: Large concentrations of humans produce large concentrations of waste. Kitchen waste, broken objects, and similar material all need to be disposed of, while small numbers of people can dispose of their waste locally without encouraging vermin or endangering their health. Once people began to live together in large numbers, around five thousand years ago, such methods began to become impractical and material usually was brought into these new settlements but would rarely be taken out again. Up until the nineteenth century when organised rubbish disposal became widespread in urban areas people invariably threw their waste from their windows or buried it in their gardens. If their houses fell down, a common enough occurrence when planning laws were non-existent, owners would pick out what they could reuse, stamp down the remains and rebuild on the old site. The effect of this is that even a moderately sized settlement of any antiquity is built on top of a heap of refuse and demolished buildings and is therefore raised up from its original height on a plateau of archaeology. This is most apparent in the tel sites of the Near East where towns that have been occupied for thousands of years are raised up many metres above the surrounding landscape. In walled towns such as those in medieval Europe the effect of the encircling defences was to hold in the waste so that it could not slip outwards, magnifying the effect. Historic development Archaeological excavation within historic cities therefore often produces a thick stratigraphy dating back to the original foundation and telling the story of its history. The City of London serves as an example, for urban excavations have been performed there since the late 1900s. These excavations, performed in populated areas of the city, revealed historical evidence of events unforeseen previously by historians. London sits on a tel, which preserves a layer of dark material, attributed to the burning of the city by Boudica in 60 AD. It was only by excavation of the urban areas that these revelations could be made, as the city has long since outgrown its borders after its rebuild, some years after the Boudican revolt. The dense stratigraphy of such cities posed problems for the archaeologists who first excavated them. Earlier excavations were generally limited to rural areas, or towns which had been long abandoned. Open area excavation was feasible as there was plenty of space and the archaeology could often be exposed just in plan. In working cities however, space for excavation is usually limited to the size of the open plot and one layer of archaeology needs to be excavated before the next one can be exposed. Additionally, Rome was also a big archaeological site since it was considered well established and advanced over time. Many excavations have been done there and later studied by archaeologists. One archaeologist who spent great time studying Roman archaeology was W.F. Grimes. Issues such as this had appeared before, at Pompeii or at multiphase rural sites but the move towards the investigation of cities, which began in Europe following the Second World War. The trend of urban excavation in areas such as Europe, the East Coast of the United States, and other western world cities, has grown since the war. Due to the bombing of landscapes during the war, the possibility of losing evidence connected to early civilizations became realized. The idea of settlement follows a principle, that settlement is made where resources are conveniently accessed. Prosperous cities, such as Boston and London, began as settlements, and grew quickly due to the convenient access of resources. However, the fact that these cities still exist today does not dismiss the fact that, at some point in history, some other civilization had once settled there. Methods The resulting solution revolved around the method of single context recording. This method was started by Ed Harris and Patrick Ottaway in 1976 before being expanded upon by the Museum of London in the mid 1980s and transferred to the York Archaeological Trust. The practice involves drawing each feature individually in plan and then relating its position to the site grid rather than planning large areas at once. Each drawing is made on a square piece of translucent film representing a 5-metre x 5 metre grid square. The site is excavated down to the first significant layer of archaeology and features excavated and recorded as normal but also planned as single contexts. The site is then reduced to the next layer of archaeology and the process begins again. The excavation and recording can continue until natural deposits are reached. A small, deep trench known as a sondage is often excavated at first to provide a view of the entire stratigraphy at once and give an indication of the quantity of material to be excavated. Simply put, if someone does one plan per context than the method that are using is single context recording. Once the work is finished, the square sheets can be overlaid onto one another to provide a picture of the site. By identifying which features cut others and using information from dateable artefacts and ecofacts an archaeologist can isolate various phases of activity and show how the use of the site developed of periods of hundreds or even thousands of years. Context record sheets produced by the individual excavators provide further information on each context's nature and relationship with its neighbours. Such interpretation would be impossible using open area excavation where numerous overall site plans would soon seem inflexible. Famous urban archaeologists *W. F.

The Wadsworth is noted for its collections of European Baroque art, ancient Egyptian and Classical bronzes, French and American Impressionist paintings, Hudson River School landscapes, modernist masterpieces and contemporary works, as well as collections of early American furniture and decorative arts. Founded in 1842 and opened in 1844, it is the oldest continually operating public art museum in the United States.The Redwood Library and Athenaeum in Newport, Rhode Island was founded in 1747, and opened a private museum in 1750. Charles Willson Peale opened a public museum on the second floor of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1786, and charged admission. The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, organized in 1805, opened its public museum in 1806, and charged admission of 25 cents. The Peale Museum in Baltimore, Maryland opened its doors to the public in 1814. The museum is located at 600 Main Street in a distinctive castle-like building in downtown Hartford, Connecticut, the state's capital. With of exhibition space, the museum is the largest art museum in the state of Connecticut. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The museum is a member of the North American Reciprocal Museums program.  Museum history  Namesake The Wadsworth, as it is most commonly known, was constructed on the site of the family home of Daniel Wadsworth in the heart of downtown Hartford. Its architects were Alexander Jackson Davis and Ithiel Town, who designed the \\"castle\\" that is the Atheneum's oldest building. Construction began in 1842 after the museum was incorporated on June 1 of that year. The museum opened on July 31, 1844 and has operated continuously since then. The Wadsworth family, being one of the oldest and most affluent in the city, contributed numerous valuable pieces of art to be displayed at the time the museum opened. The first collection consisted of 78 paintings, two marble busts, one portrait miniature, and one bronze sculpture. In addition to the fine arts collection, the original building housed the forerunners of the Hartford Public Library and Connecticut Historical Society, giving rise to the name \\"Atheneum,\\" an institution broadly devoted to culture and learning. In light of that public role, the Wadsworth has, since its founding, played host to a wide variety of cultural and community activities, including dramatic and dance performances, exhibits of historical artifacts, social functions, and benefits. Modern history Building on the Wadsworth family's largess, generations of more recent donors have added to the museum's collections and resources. Foremost among them are Elizabeth Jarvis Colt, widow of firearms magnate Samuel Colt, and financier and Hartford native John Pierpont Morgan. They each contributed more than 1,000 objects to the museum's collections, the former a significant group of Hudson River School landscapes and the Colt firearms collection, the latter an assemblage of priceless Renaissance decorative arts and Colonial-era American furniture. Samuel P. Avery donated works ranging from a Babylonian clay tablet to Chinese Qing Dynasty porcelain and mid-19th century French sculpture, as well as funds for new construction, producing the country's first museum interior designed in the International Style. In 1927, the museum received a million-dollar bequest (about $20 million today in inflation-adjusted terms) from banker Frank Sumner, establishing a sizable acquisitions endowment. In the hands of forward-thinking museum directors, particularly A. Everett 'Chick' Austin and Charles Cunningham, the fund has enabled the purchase of major works by masters including Caravaggio, Dal√≠, Gauguin, Mir√≥, Strozzi, Tintoretto, Van Dyck, and Zurbar√°n. In the 1940s and 1950s, bequests by Clara Hinton Gould and Anne Parrish Titzell enriched the museum's holdings of Hudson River School and Impressionist paintings, with celebrated pieces by Church, Cole, Gifford, Monet, and Renoir entering the collection. In the same period, artwork and funds bequeathed to the museum by Henry Schnakenberg led to the acquisition of a group of Cypriot, Egyptian, and Greek antiquities as well as paintings by modernists including Peter Blume, Stuart Davis, and Reginald Marsh. It is also in the 1940s that the museum becomes the haunt of Marguerite Yourcenar as she is writing the Memoirs of Hadrian. The post-war and contemporary division has benefited from the generosity of Tony Smith and Susan Morse Hilles, whose gifts include groundbreaking works by Josef Albers, Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman, Robert Rauschenberg, and Mark Rothko. With funds given by the Archibald, Goodwin, Keney, and Smith families, and by Alexander Goldfarb and Charles Schwartz, the museum has acquired valuable pieces by Alexander Calder, Artemisia Gentileschi, Cindy Sherman, Bill Viola, and Kara Walker. A 2004 gift of 125 photographs from Janice and Mickey Cartin Collection includes works by On Kawara, Ed Ruscha, Hans-Peter Feldmann, Arnold Odermatt, Lucinda Devlin, Joe Ovelman, Jonathan Monk, Frank Breuer, Malick Sidib√©, and more.

The design required demolishing the Goodwin Building, put up in 1969, and enclosing the Avery Courtyard.Noted Hartford Museum Unveils Its New Design The New York Times, June 22, 2002. However, the proposal was scrapped in 2003 due to fundraising difficulties and changes in the museum's leadership. A later plan to expand into the former Hartford Times building was also abandoned due to cost concerns. In March 2010, the museum announced the start of a comprehensive renovation project across all five of the museum's buildings, which at completion resulted in the addition of of refurbished gallery space and the complete reinstallation of the museum's permanent collections of European art, European decorative arts, and contemporary art. The $33 million renovation, designed by the Hartford-based architecture firm Smith Edwards McCoy, was completed in 2015, garnering praise from local and national art critics.Sebastian Smee (September 19, 2015), \\"European Marvels Await in Hartford at Refurbished Atheneum\\", Boston Globe.  Structure and contents  The structure itself consists of the original, castle-like building, plus four wings that have been added during the intervening years, in styles ranging from Tudor Revival and Renaissance Revival to International. The museum is home to approximately 50,000 objects, including ancient Roman, Greek, and Egyptian bronzes; paintings from the Renaissance, Baroque, and French and American Impressionist eras, among others; 18th-century German and French porcelains (including Meissen and S√®vres); Hudson River School landscapes; early American clothing and decorations; early African-American art and historical artifacts; and more. The collections span more than 5,000 years of world history. Nathan Hale, statue by Enoch Smith Woods, 1889 Just outside the \\"castle\\" is an 1899 statue of Nathan Hale, by Enoch S. Woods. A short distance away, within the Connecticut State Capitol is another, better-known sculpture of Hale by Bela Pratt, a copy of his original at Yale University. The Atheneum also owns the A. Everett Austin House, a National Historic Landmark and home of one of the museum's most distinguished directors. The house, located in Hartford's historic West End, is open to the public as a museum.  Museum firsts  Since its beginning, the Wadsworth has had a long tradition of \\"firsts\\". In 1933, the Wadsworth sponsored George Balanchine's immigration to the United States from the Soviet Union. Shortly after his immigration, Balanchine founded the School of American Ballet, which led to the formation of the New York City Ballet. He then chose to have the Producing Company of the School of American Ballet's first performances at the Avery Memorial Theatre of Wadsworth in December 1934, including his first ballet choreographed in America, Serenade. The museum was the first in America to acquire pieces by Salvador Dal√≠, Balthus, Frederic Church, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Piet Mondrian, and many other famous artists. Under the directorship of Arthur Everett Austin, Jr., the first American exhibition of surrealism was shown at the Wadsworth in 1931, and the first major U.S. Pablo Picasso retrospective was held in 1934.Perl, Jed.

Yorke (born August 3, 1941) is a Distinguished University Research Professor of Mathematics and Physics and former chair of the Mathematics Department at the University of Maryland, College Park. Born in Plainfield, New Jersey, United States, Yorke attended The Pingry School, then located in Hillside, New Jersey. Yorke is now a Distinguished University Research Professor of Mathematics and Physics with the Institute for Physical Science and Technology at the University of Maryland. In June 2013, Dr. Yorke retired as chair of the University of Maryland's Math department. He devotes his university efforts to collaborative research in chaos theory and genomics. He and Benoit Mandelbrot were the recipients of the 2003 Japan Prize in Science and Technology: Yorke was selected for his work in chaotic systems. In 2003 He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society. and in 2012 became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. He received the Doctor Honoris Causa degree from the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain, in January 2014. In June 2014, he received the Doctor Honoris Causa degree from Le Havre University, Le Havre, France. He received the Thompson Reuters Citations Laureate in Physics 2016. Contributions Period three implies chaos He and his co-author T.Y. Li coined the mathematical term chaos in a paper they published in 1975 entitled Period three implies chaos,T.Y. Li, and J.A. Yorke, Period Three Implies Chaos, American Mathematical Monthly 82, 985 (1975). in which it was proved that any one-dimensional continuous map :F: R ‚ÜíR that has a period-3 orbit must have two properties: (1) For each positive integer p, there is a point in R that returns to where it started after p applications of the map and not before. This means there are infinitely many periodic points (any of which may or may not be stable): different sets of points for each period p. This turned out to be a special case of Sharkovskii's theorem. The second property requires some definitions. A pair of points x and y is called ‚Äúscrambled‚Äù if as the map is applied repeatedly to the pair, they get closer together and later move apart and then get closer together and move apart, etc., so that they get arbitrarily close together without staying close together. The analogy is to an egg being scrambled forever, or to typical pairs of atoms behaving in this way. A set S is called a scrambled set if every pair of distinct points in S is scrambled. Scrambling is a kind of mixing. (2) There is an uncountably infinite set S that is scrambled. A map satisfying Property 2 is sometimes called \\"chaotic in the sense of Li and Yorke\\". Property 2 is often stated succinctly as their article's title phrase \\"Period three implies chaos\\". The uncountable set of chaotic points may, however, be of measure zero (see for example the article Logistic map), in which case the map is said to have unobservable nonperiodicity or unobservable chaos. O.G.Y control method He and his colleagues (Edward Ott and Celso Grebogi) had shown with a numerical example that one can convert a chaotic motion into a periodic one by a proper time- dependent perturbations of the parameter. This article is considered as one among the classic works in the control theory of chaos and their control method is known as the O.G.Y. method. Books Together with Kathleen T. Alligood and Tim D. Sauer, he was the author of the book Chaos: An Introduction to Dynamical Systems.

He is best remembered for having produced one of the earliest maps of Mars in 1867 from 27 drawings by the English observer William Rutter Dawes. His map was later superseded by those of Giovanni Schiaparelli and Eug√®ne Antoniadi and his nomenclature was dropped (for instance, his \\"Kaiser Sea\\" became Syrtis Major Planum). He used old drawings of Mars dating back to 1666 to try to determine the sidereal day of Mars. His final estimate, in 1873, was 24h 37m 22.713s, very close to the modern value of 24h 37m 22.663s. Nevertheless, Frederik Kaiser's value of 24h 37m 22.622s is closer, by 0.012 seconds in 88,642.688 seconds, a very small difference in the error of both computations. The crater Proctor on Mars is named after him. Biography Spy in Vanity Fair, 3 March 1883 He was a delicate child, and, his father dying in 1850, his mother attended herself to his education. On his health improving he was sent to King's College London, and subsequently earned a scholarship at St John's College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1860 as 23rd wrangler. His marriage while still an undergraduate probably accounted for his low place in the tripos. He then read for the bar, but turned to astronomy and authorship instead, and in 1865 published an article on the Colours of Double Stars in the Cornhill Magazine. His first book Saturn and its System was published in the same year, at his own expense. This work contains an elaborate account of the phenomena presented by the planet; but although favourably received by astronomers, it had no great sale. He intended to follow it up with similar treatises on Mars, Jupiter, Sun, Moon, comets and meteors, stars, and nebulae, and had in fact commenced a monograph on Mars, when the failure of a New Zealand bank deprived him of an independence which would have enabled him to carry out his scheme without anxiety as to its commercial success or failure. Being thus obliged to depend upon his writings for the support of his family, and having learned by the fate of his Saturn and its System that the general public are not attracted by works requiring arduous study, he cultivated a more popular style. He wrote for a number of periodicals; and although he has stated that he would at this time willingly have turned to stone-breaking on the roads, or any other form of hard and honest but unscientific labour, if a modest competence had been offered him in any such direction, he attained a high degree of popularity, and his numerous works had a wide influence in familiarising the public with the main facts of astronomy. His earlier efforts were, however, not always successful. His Handbook of the Stars (1866) was refused by Messrs Longmans and Messrs Macmillan, but being privately printed, it sold fairly well. For his Half-Hours with the Telescope (1868), which eventually reached a 20th edition, he received originally ¬£25 from Messrs Hardwick. Although teaching was uncongenial to him he took pupils in mathematics, and held for a time the position of mathematical coach for Woolwich and Sandhurst. His literary standing meantime improved, and he became a regular contributor to The Intellectual Observer, Chamber's Journal and the Popular Science Review. In 1870 appeared his Other Worlds Than Ours,Richard A. Proctor: Other worlds than ours : the plurality of worlds studied under the light of recent scientific researches. London : Longmans, Green, 1870. (Digital Copy) in which he discussed the question of the plurality of worlds in the light of new facts. This was followed by a long series of popular treatises in rapid succession, amongst the more important of which are Light Science for Leisure Hours and The Sun (1871); The Orbs around Us and Essays on Astronomy (1872); The Expanse of Heaven, The Moon and The Borderland of Science (1873); The Universe and the Coming Transits and Transits of Venus (1874); Our Place among Infinities (1875); Myths and Marvels of Astronomy (1877); The Universe of Stars (1878); Flowers of the Sky (1879); The Poetry of Astronomy (1880); Easy Star Lessons and Familiar Science Studies (1882); Mysteries of Time and Space (1883) - Digital Copy; \\"The Great Pyramid\\" (1883) - Digital Copy; The Universe of Suns (1884); The Seasons (1885); Other Suns than Ours and Half-Hours with the Stars (1887). In 1881 he founded Knowledge, a popular weekly magazine of science (converted into a monthly in 1885), which had a considerable circulation. In it he wrote on a great variety of subjects, including chess and whist. He was also the author of the articles on astronomy in the American Cyclopaedia and the ninth edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and was well known as a popular lecturer on astronomy in England, America and Australia. Proctor's map of Mars Elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866, he became honorary secretary in 1872, and contributed eighty-three separate papers to its Monthly Notices. Of these the more noteworthy dealt with the distribution of stars, star clusters and nebulae, and the construction of the sidereal universe. He was an expert in all that related to map-drawing, and published two star-atlases. A chart on an isographic projection, exhibiting all the stars contained in the Bonner Durchmusterung, was designed to show the laws according to which the stars down to the 9‚Äì10th magnitude are distributed over the northern heavens. His Theoretical Considerations respecting the Corona (Monthly Notices, xxxi. 184, 254) also deserve mention, as well as his discussions of the rotation of Mars, by which be deduced its period with a probable error of 0.005. He also vigorously criticised the official arrangements for observing the transits of Venus of 1874 and 1882. His largest and most ambitious work, Old and New Astronomy, left unfinished at his death, was completed by Arthur Cowper Ranyard and published in 1892 with a second edition in 1895. He settled in America some time after his second marriage in 1881, and died of yellow fever at New York City on 12 September 1888. A monument was later erected in his memory. Mary Proctor, his daughter by his first marriage, became an astronomer and a successful lecturer and writer.

Professional career After graduation Masako moved back to Japan, where for six months (April to October 1986) she studied law at the University of Tokyo to prepare for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs's entrance examination.Hills, p. 115. Out of 800 applicants only 28 passed, Masako was one of them, along with two other women. \\"She was assigned, first, to the oddly named Second International Organizations Division which deals with Japan's relations with international agencies, such as the OECD, a club of 30 rich countries committed to free trade and development. Her assignments included dealing with the OECD's environmental affairs committee ... by all accounts she acquitted herself well‚Äîher command of spoken languages, so rare in Japan, was a huge advantage‚Äîand was popular with most of her workmates.\\"Hills, p. 116. During her free time, Masako attended cooking classes to, according to interviews with her instructor, \\"be able to cook proper Japanese dishes when she was entertaining [foreigners].\\"Hills, p. 119. Two years later, in 1988, Masako was chosen by the Ministry to be sponsored for two years' postgraduate study overseas with full pay, just as her father Hisashi had been years earlier.Hills, pp. 137, 155. Masako \\"desperately wanted to go back to Harvard to do her master's\\". According to her former Harvard adviser Oliver Oldman, she \\"tried to re-enroll to work towards ... a Juris Doctor. However, Harvard's bureaucrats would not give her credit for her study-time at the University of Tokyo.\\"Hills, pp. 152‚Äì153. Therefore, Masako enrolled in her second choice, studying International Relations under Sir Adam RobertsHills, p. 139. at Balliol College, Oxford.Hills, p. 155. However, for unclear reasons Masako did not finish her thesisHills, pp. 140‚Äì141. and instead returned to Japan in 1990. Courtship and marriage 500-yen coin was issued to commemorate the Imperial Wedding Masako first met Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan, at a tea for Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo in November 1986,Hills, p .120. during her studies at the University of Tokyo. The prince was immediately captivated by herHills, pp. 120‚Äì121. and arranged for them to meet several times over the next few weeks.Hills, p. 123. Because of this they were pursued relentlessly by the press throughout 1987.Hills, p. 136. However, Masako's name disappeared from the list of possible royal brides due to controversy about her maternal grandfather, Yutaka Egashira, who while working for the Industrial Bank of Japan was assigned to take over management of one of its creditors the Chisso Corporation to prevent it from financial collapse.Hills, p. 133. Chisso, built in the 1930s, dumped the methylmercury used to make acetaldehyde (a chemical in plastic) into the water surrounding Minamata and other towns, causing the infamous Minamata disease and the resulting scandal. Despite this controversy and Masako's travelling to Oxford University's Balliol College for the next two years, Naruhito remained interested in her. Masako refused to marry the prince because it would force her to give up her promising career in diplomacy and severely restrict her independence and freedoms. Masako finally accepted his third proposal on 9 December 1992. It was reported that he argued that serving as Crown Princess of Japan would only be \\"another form of diplomacy\\" before she finally accepted this third proposal. The Imperial Household Council formally announced the engagement on 19 January 1993; the engagement ceremony was held on 12 April 1993. Although many were surprised at the news, as it was believed that the prince and Masako had separated, the engagement was met with a surge of renewed media attention directed toward the Imperial family and their new princess. Masako married Crown Prince Naruhito in a traditional wedding ceremony on 9 June 1993.Hills, p. 2. By virtue of the marriage, Masako Owada assumed the formal style Her Imperial Highness The Crown Princess of Japan. As tradition dictates, upon her entry into the imperial family and like other members, she received a personal emblem (): rosa rugosa (). In addition, she was placed in the Japanese Imperial Order of Precedence (used for the most formal occasions) behind her mother-in-law, Empress Michiko, and her grandmother-in-law, Empress Dowager Nagako. The orchid flower Dendrobium Masako Kotaishi Hidenka was named in her honour to celebrate the wedding. She became the third commoner to marry into the imperial family, after her mother-in-law and her sister-in-law, Princess Kiko. The then-Crown Prince and Crown Princess marked their 20th wedding anniversary in June 2013. Family Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako in 2019 Children Masako's first pregnancy was announced in December 1999, but she miscarried. The Emperor and Empress have one daughter: . Succession Their daughter's birth, which occurred more than eight years after their marriage, sparked lively debate in Japan about whether The Imperial Household Law of 1947 should be changed from that of agnatic primogeniture to either cognatic or absolute primogeniture, which would allow a woman to succeed to the Chrysanthemum Throne. A government-appointed panel of experts submitted a report on 25 October 2005, recommending that the Imperial Succession Law be amended to permit absolute primogeniture. On 20 January 2006, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi used part of his annual keynote speech to address the controversy when he pledged to submit a bill to the Diet letting women ascend to the throne in order that the imperial throne be continued in a stable manner. Koizumi did not announce a timing for the legislation to be introduced nor did he provide details about the content, but he did note that it would be in line with the conclusions of the 2005 Government Panel. Plans to change the male-only law of Imperial succession were shelved after it was announced in February 2006 that Masako's brother-in-law and his wife, Prince and Princess Akishino, were expecting their third child. On 6 September 2006, Princess Akishino gave birth to a son, Hisahito, who was third-in-line to the Chrysanthemum Throne under the current law, after his uncle, the Emperor, and his father, Prince Akishino.. Public life Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako attended the JET Programme 30th Anniversary Commemorative Ceremony at the Keio Plaza Hotel in Tokyo, November 2016 In 1994, the couple visited Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain. They visited Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan in 1995, and again traveled to Jordan in 1999. In 1999, they also went to Belgium to attend the wedding of Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant. In 2002, they paid a visit to New Zealand and Australia. In 2006, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess went to the Netherlands with their daughter, Princess Aiko, at the invitation of Queen Beatrix for a private visit. On 30 April 2013, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess were present at the inauguration of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, which was the Crown Princess's first official overseas appearance in eleven years. In October 2014, she was present at a banquet held in honour of King Willem- Alexander and Queen M√°xima at the Tokyo Imperial Palace, which was her first appearance in such a ceremony in eleven years. She welcomed the couple during an official ceremony at the palace which was her first appearance in a welcoming ceremony after five years. In July 2015, Princess Masako traveled to Tonga with the Crown Prince in order to attend the Coronation of King Tupou VI. Over 40 members of the Japanese media covered the event, during which the happy-looking Crown Princess was warmly welcomed. In November 2015, the Crown Princess attended the Autumn Imperial Garden Party at Akasaka Imperial Garden. It was the first time for her to attend the event in twelve years. Health Masako has remained largely out of the public eye since 2002, reportedly due to emotional disorders which many speculate are caused by the pressure to produce a male heir and adjusting to life in the Imperial Family. Alt URL In July 2004, she was diagnosed as suffering from adjustment disorder and was reported to be seeking treatment. On 11 July 2008, Naruhito sought public understanding for his ailing wife. He was on an eight-day trip to Spain without her: \\"I would like the public to understand that Masako is continuing to make her utmost efforts with the help of those around her. Please continue to watch over her kindly and over the long term.\\" Pressures to produce a male heir, to conform with the ancient traditions and a 1947 Imperial Household Law are perceived to be behind her illness, as well as negative media coverage of her behavior, the stress of royal responsibility and public life, and turf battles among the Imperial Household Agency.Schreiber, Mark, \\"Japan's troubled royals put up a brave front\\", Japan Times 1 January 2012, p. 13. In December 2012, at the time of her 49th birthday, Masako issued a statement thanking the Japanese people for their support and saying that she was still receiving treatment for her illness. The Japanese Constitution does not allow the members of the Imperial Family to engage in political activities. Naruhito made controversial comments about discourtesies and pressures placed on his wife by the Imperial Household Agency and his wife's desire to pursue the life of a diplomat. On her 55th birthday, Masako released a statement saying that she felt insecure about her future role as an empress, but added that she would like \\"to make an effort for the happiness of the people.\\" Titles, styles and honours Titles *9 December 1963 ‚Äì 9 June 1993: **Miss Masako Owada (Â∞èÂíåÁî∞ÈõÖÂ≠ê Owada Masako) *9 June 1993 ‚Äì 30 April 2019: **Her Imperial Highness The Crown Princess of Japan (ÁöáÂ§™Â≠êÂ¶ÉÊÆø‰∏ã K≈çtaishi-hi Denka) **Her Imperial Highness The Crown Princess Masako (ÁöáÂ§™Â≠êÂæ≥‰ªÅË¶™ÁéãÂ¶ÉÈõÖÂ≠êÊÆø‰∏ã K≈çtaishi Naruhito Shinn≈ç-hi Masako Denka) *1 May 2019 ‚Äì present: **Her Majesty The Empress of Japan (ÁöáÂêéÈôõ‰∏ã K≈çg≈ç Heika) Honours Imperial Standard of the Empress =National= * : Grand Mistress and Grand Cordon (Paulownia) of the Order of the Precious Crown * : Dame of the Decoration of the Red CrossMasako wearing Red Cross Medals * : Recipient of the Red Cross Medal =Foreign= * : Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Sash for Services to the Republic of Austria (1999) * : Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold (10 October 2016)Newm Royals * : Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer * : Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary (2000) * : Dame of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau (27 November 2017) * : Honorary Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (2012) * : Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown (29 October 2014) * : Recipient of the King Willem-Alexander Inauguration Medal * : Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav (26 March 2001) * : Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Henry (2 December 1993) * : Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (8 November 2008)Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado * : ** Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Queen SƒÅlote Tupou III (4 July 2015)Tonga ** Coronation Medal of H.M.

It attempts to address the mind‚Äìbody problem and resists the Western traditions of mind‚Äìbody dualism. The term bodymind is also typically seen and encountered in disability studies, referring to the intricate and often inseparable relationship between the body and the mind, and how these two units might act as one. The field of psychosomatic medicine investigates the embodied manifestations of psychological processes.  Dualism vs holism  In the field of philosophy, the theory of dualism is the speculation that the mental and the physical parts of us- like our minds and our bodies- are different or separate. Holism is the idea or speculation that all the properties of a system- such as the system of our thoughts, and the system of our body- cannot be determined or explained by looking at its components individually. Rather, the whole system looked at a complete whole is a determiner in understanding and viewing the idea, concept, or theory being questioned. On the Western side of the globe, popular culture tends to be more on the side that there are two centers of our being that makes us who we are and how we see and interact with the world. The first is the mind ‚Äì the center of our thoughts, and the heart (or body) ‚Äì which is the center of our feelings. In Western culture, there is more of a debate on whether these different parts that make us unique are separate or connected. In Eastern culture, especially in areas such as and surrounding India and the Middle East, the idea of body-mind is the exact opposite. The words ‚Äúmind‚Äù and ‚Äúheart‚Äô both translate into ‚Äúchitta,‚Äù which refers to the mind. ‚ÄúChitta‚Äù is one of the three overlapping terms used that refers to the mind. The other two are ‚Äúmanas‚Äù and ‚Äúvi√±√±ƒÅ·πáa.‚Äù Together, they are parts that make up the whole or entirety of our minds, and our mental processes as a whole. Often used in practices such as yoga, commonly used and followed in more ‚Äúself-help‚Äù medicines, In the Indian model, this heart-mind has three aspects: the capability of paying attention and sensory processing, the creation of our identity or self-image (more commonly known as Ego), and the capacity to imagine things, form judgements, and making decisions.  Historical background  An important figure in the concept and belief of body-mind is an American philosopher, scholar, and professor of philosophy, religion, and culture, William H. Poteat (19 April 1919 ‚Äì 17 May 2000). Throughout the course of his lifetime, Poteat was known for his great contributions to Post-Critical Philosophy and for being the leader of formative and influential ideas such as ‚Äúbodymind.‚Äù As a man who emphasized in philosophy, it is said he identified himself as a ‚Äú‚Äù practicing dialectician.‚Äù He was known to encourage and challenge not only himself, but those around him, to question, understand, and challenge the reasoning and facts of the confusing aspects of modern life. Poteat drew his inspirations and ideas from Michael Polanyi, who wrote ‚ÄúThe Stability of Beliefs‚Äù in 1952. In this essay, Polanyi spoke about how there are two ways of holding beliefs. He stated, ‚ÄúSome are held by the explicit profession of certain articles of faith, as the Apostles‚Äô Creed when recited in the words of the Book of Common Prayer. The other form of belief is held implicitly by reliance on a particular conceptual framework by which all experience is interpreted.‚Äù Other influential people Poteat looked to for further inspiration were the Danish philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), a man considered to be the first existential philosopher (philosophy that emphasizes individual existence, freedom, and choice), the Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908‚Äì1961), and Hannah Arendt (1906-1975), a German-American philosopher and political theorist and many others. Together, these people and their ideas, along with Poteat‚Äôs own ideas and theories, helped him further understand and share the concept and ideas of what bodymind is in today‚Äôs modern world.  Bodymind and religion  The approach to bodymind is believed in and viewed through multiple faiths and practices. These include Vajrayana, Mahayana, Theravada, and Zen Buddhism. Like many religions today, these different branches of Buddhism originate from the same root and tree. They have very similar ideas and beliefs, but there are differences in the way they practice and live their beliefs. However, in each of their faiths, the concept of bodymind, otherwise known as namarupa, is key. Another similarity that all the different branches of Buddhism share is the daily practice of ‚ÄúSila‚Äù ‚ÄúSamhdai,‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrajna.‚Äù The idea and practice of Buddhism originated in India, and is now practiced throughout the world. The core teachings of Buddhism are the Three Universal Truths, The Four Noble Truths, and The Noble Eightfold Path. The three Universal Truths are: Nothing is lost in the universe, everything changes, and the law of cause and effect. The Four Noble Truths are: suffering exists (Dukkha), there is a cause of suffering (Samudaya), there is an end to suffering (Nirodha), and in order to end suffering, you must follow the Eightfold Path (Magga). Finally, the Eightfold Path consists of the following: 1) Right understanding of the Four Noble Truths 2) Right thinking 3) Right speech 4) Right conduct or action 5) Right livelihood 6) Right effort 7) Right mindfulness 8) Right concentration Buddhism is one of the main ways in which we can view and more fully understand the bodymind approach- especially in today's modern world of many different advancements, ideas, and beliefs.  Modern understanding  ‚ÄúThe mind is composed of mental fragments- sensations, feelings, thoughts, imaginations, all flowing now in an ordered sequence, now in a chaotic fashion‚Ä¶. On the other hand, the body is constructed under the underlying laws of physics, and its components obey the well-enumerated laws of physiology. It is these characteristic differences between these two ‚Äì between mind and body ‚Äì that lead to the Mind-Body problem.\\" There is still no concrete evidence if the mind has more impact on who we are, or of our bodies do. While the Western population tends to believe more in the idea of dualism, there is no reason to not believe the idea of holism. Many throughout the world who try to understand and live the idea of holism, say they feel more connected with themselves, with the environment, and with those around them. If anything, bodymind shows the significance of connected everything is- both in and outside ourselves. Bodymind is brought up in many different situations today in the modern world- especially in modern and alternative medicines. Relevance to alternative medicine In the field of alternative medicine, bodymind implies that * The body, mind, emotions, and spirit are dynamically interrelated. * Experience, including physical stress, emotional injury, and pleasures are stored in the body's cells which in turn affects one's reactions to stimuli.Keleman, Stanley: Your Body speaks its Mind, Center Press (US) (1989) The term can be a number of disciplines, including: * Psychoneuroimmunology, the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body. * Body psychotherapy,Totton, N.

USA (1984) (2nd edit. 1990) The term overlaps in significant ways, especially in its anti-dualist intention, with the philosophical term mindbody developed independently by philosopher William H. Poteat.  Relevance to disability studies  The term bodymind is most generally used in the academic field of disability studies. Disability scholars use the term bodymind to emphasize the interdependence and inseparability of the body and mind. Prominent scholars who have written academically about the bodymind include Eli Clare, Margaret Price, Sami Schalk, Alyson Patsavas, and Alison Kafer. Clare and Price have proposed that the bodymind expresses the interrelatedness of mental and physical processes, and Schalk defines the bodymind similarly as it pertains to disability and race. One of the first scholars to popularize the concept of bodymind is Eli Clare, a writer and activist for queer and disability studies. Clare uses bodymind in his work Brilliant Imperfection as a way to resist common Western assumptions that the body and mind are separate entities, or that the mind is ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù to the body. Similarly, scholar Margaret Price writes that the combination of ‚Äòbody‚Äô and ‚Äòmind‚Äô in one term acknowledges that ‚Äúmental and physical processes not only affect each other but also give rise to each other‚Äîthat is, because they tend to act as one, even though they are conventionally understood as two‚Äù. Scholar Sami Schalk in her work Bodyminds Reimagined uses the term bodymind to recognize that ‚Äúprocesses within our being impact one another in such a way that the notion of a physical versus mental process is difficult, if not impossible to clearly discern in most cases‚Äù. Schalk emphasizes the utility of the term bodymind as it relates to disability and race. In analyzing histories of race, gender, and disability, Schalk notes that it is important to recognize the non-physical impact of various oppressions. For Schalk, the term bodymind highlights the ‚Äúpsychic stress‚Äù of oppression. In relation to transgenerational trauma in people of color, bodymind is used to show how the psychological toll of oppression and its resulting stress has lasting mental and physical manifestations. The connection between the body and mind is not merely theoretical; for example, the interrelation between mental and physical health is explored in the field of psychosomatic medicine, which investigates bodily processes in relation to social and psychological factors. For example, the psychiatric condition major depressive disorder often manifests physically in the forms of excessive sleeping, loss of appetite, weight gain or loss, back pain, and headaches.

The park includes the three larger islands Komodo, Padar and Rinca, and 26 smaller ones, with a total area of 1,733 km2 (603 km2 of it land). The national park was founded in 1980 to protect the Komodo dragon, the world's largest lizard.UNESCO: Advisory Body Evaluation, retrieved 2 February 2010 Later it was dedicated to protecting other species, including marine species. In 1991 the national park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Komodo National Park has been selected as one of the New7Wonders of Nature.New 7 Wonders of the world, retrieved 29 December 2011 The waters surrounding Komodo island contain rich marine biodiversity. Komodo islands is also a part of the Coral Triangle, which contains some of the richest marine biodiversity on Earth. History Komodo National Park was established in 1980. It was declared a World Heritage Site and a Man and Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1991. The park was initially established to conserve the unique Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), first discovered by the scientific world in 1912 by Lieutenant J. K. H. van Steyn van Henbroek, the Civil Administrator in Reo, Flores Island. Since then conservation goals have expanded to protecting the entire biodiversity of the region, both marine and terrestrial. The majority of the people in and around the park are fishermen originally from Bima (Sumbawa), Manggarai, South Flores, and South Sulawesi. Those from South Sulawesi are from the Suku Bajau or Bugis ethnic groups. The Suku Bajau were originally nomadic and moved from location to location in the region of Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara and Maluku, to make their livelihoods. Descendants of the original people of Komodo, the Ata Modo, still live in Komodo, but there are no pure blood people left and their culture and language is slowly being integrated with the recent migrants. Little is known of the early history of the Komodo islanders. They were subjects of the Sultanate of Bima, although the island‚Äôs remoteness from Bima meant its affairs were probably little troubled by the Sultanate other than by occasional demands for tribute. Geography and climate The rugged terrain of Komodo Island with few trees makes it one of the driest locations in Indonesia. Rinca Island Padar Island The park comprises a coastal section of western Flores, the three larger islands of Komodo, Padar and Rinca, 26 smaller islands and the surrounding waters of the Sape Straights. The islands of the national park are of volcanic origin. The terrain is generally rugged, characterized by rounded hills, with altitudes up to 735 m. The climate is one of the driest of Indonesia with annual rainfall between 800mm and 1000mm. Harsh daily temperatures in the dry season from May to October are around 40 ¬∞C. Flora and fauna The hot and dry climate of the park, characterized by savannah vegetation, makes it a good habitat for the endemic Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis). Their populations are restricted to the islands of Komodo (1,700), Rinca (1,300), Gili Motang (100), Gili Dasami (100), and Flores (c. 2,000), while extinct on Padar. Cloud forests appear only in few areas above 500 metres but they provide habitat to several endemic flora. Coastal vegetation includes mangrove forest, which generally appear in the sheltered bays of the three larger islands. Fringing and patch coral reefs are extensive and best developed on the north-east coast of Komodo. The park is rich in marine life, including whale sharks, ocean sunfish, manta rays, eagle rays, pygmy seahorse, false pipefish, clown frogfish, nudibranchs, blue-ringed octopus, sponges, tunicates, and coral. Varieties of cetaceans inhabit in adjacent waters from smaller sized dolphins to sperm whales and even blue whales. Omura's whales, one of the least known of rorquals have been confirmed to range waters within the park.Kahn, B. 2001. \\"Komodo National Park Cetacean Surveys: April 2001 and 1999‚Äì2001 survey synopsis\\". Presented working paper CMS/SEAMAMSII/24. United Nations Environment Programme ‚Äì Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (UNEP/CMS) Second International Conference on the Marine Mammals of Southeast Asia. July 22‚Äì23, 2002. Demaguette, Philippines. 39pp. Endangered dugongs still live in Komodo areas as well. The terrestrial fauna is of rather poor diversity in comparison to the marine fauna. The number of terrestrial animal species found in the park is not high, but the area is important from a conservation perspective as some species are endemic. Many of the mammals are Asiatic in origin Including the Timor deer, wild boar, water buffalo, crab eating macaques and civet. Several of the reptiles and birds are Australian in origin. These include the orange-footed scrubfowl, the lesser sulpher crested cockatoo, and the helmeted friarbird. The most famous of Komodo National Park's reptiles is the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis). It is the world's largest lizard and is among the world's largest reptiles and can reach 3m or more in length and weigh over 70 kg. Twelve terrestrial snake species are found on the island in addition to marine species. Snakes include the Javan spitting cobra (Naja sputatrix), Russell‚Äôs viper (Daboia russelii), white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris), blue lipped sea krait (Laticauda laticaudata), and Timor python (Python timoriensis). Lizards include nine skink species (Scinidae), geckos (Gekkonidae), limbless lizards (Dibamidae), and the monitor lizards such as the Komodo dragon (Varanidae). Frogs include the Asian bullfrog (Kaloula baleata), the endemic Komodo cross frog (Oreophryne jeffersoniana) and Oreophryne darewskyi. Frogs are typically found at higher, moister altitudes. The saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) was once present within the park in coastal areas including mangrove swamps but is now extinct within the area. Mammals found within the park include the Timor rusa deer (Cervus timorensis), the main prey of the Komodo dragon, horses (Equus sp.), water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), wild boar (Sus scrofa vittatus), crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis), Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus lehmanni), the endemic Rinca rat (Rattus rintjanus), and fruit bats. Domestic mammals on within the park include goats, cats and dogs which are feral. One of the main bird species is the orange-footed scrubfowl (Megapodius reinwardti), a ground dwelling bird. In areas of savanna, 27 species were observed. The zebra dove (Geopelia striata) and spotted dove (Spilopelia chinensis) were the most common species. In mixed tropical deciduous habitat, 28 bird species were observed, and helmeted friarbird (Philemon buceroides), green imperial pigeon (Ducula aenea), and lemon-bellied white-eye (Zosterops chloris) were the most common. Other birds include vibrantly coloured species such as green junglefowl (Gallus varius), great-billed parrot (Tanygnathus megalorynchos), and the critically endangered lesser sulpher crested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea). Two eagle species are found in the park, the white-bellied sea eagle and the extremely rare Flores hawk-eagle which is present on Rinca and Flores and reported but unconfirmed on Komodo Island.

Komodo Island was declared a nature reserve in 1965, and in January 1977 as a biosphere reserve under the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme. The three islands were declared a national park in 1980, which was later extended to include the surrounding marine area and a section of Flores in 1984. In 1991 the national park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. For a period after 1995 the national park authority was supported by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), an American environmental organization. A management plan was co-authored with TNC and implemented in 2000 to address problem of increasing resource exploitation, both marine and terrestrial. The plan was supported by the World Bank but faced objections from some local people and local NGOs who argued that they had not been consulted by the plan and would not share in the benefits. Most pressure on marine resources originates from fishing communities and commercial enterprises from outside the park. However, regulations and restrictions on resource use impact mostly on park residents, who have few options to make a living but rely on what the park has to offer. The provision of alternative livelihoods is part of the overall management strategy, but communities within the park are yet to benefit from appropriate measures addressing their needs.WALHI 2004 A non-profit joint venture company, PT Putri Naga Komodo (PT PNK), was established to operate tourist facilities in the hope of eventually making the park financially self-sustaining. PT PNK was partially funded by the TNC and the World Bank. After 5 years operation, in 2010 Putri Naga Komodo's (PNK) permit was compromised. After that, more illegal fishermen arrived as enforcement declined greatly following the exit of TNC which had helped fight destructive fishing practices. In early 2012, dive operators and conservationists found many desolate coral sites, reminiscent of grey moonscapes. Illegal fishermen continue to blast sites with 'bombs' in a process known as blast fishing. The fisherman use a mixture of fertilizer and kerosene in beer bottles as explosives, or use squeeze bottles to squirt cyanide into the coral in order to stun and capture fish. In the past two years more than 60 illegal fishermen have been arrested. One of the suspects was shot and killed after he tried to evade capture by throwing fish bombs at the rangers. Human habitation There are presently almost 4,000 people living within the park spread out over four settlements (Komodo, Rinca, Kerora, and Papagaran). All villages existed before 1980 when the area was declared a national park. In 1928 there were only 30 people living in Komodo Village (known locally as Kampung Komodo), and approximately 250 people on Rinca Island in 1930. The population increased rapidly, and by 1999, there were 281 families numbering 1,169 people on Komodo Island. Komodo Village has had the highest population within the park, mostly due to migration by people from Sape, Manggarai, Madura, and South Sulawesi. The number of buildings in Komodo Village has increased rapidly from 30 houses in 1958, to 194 houses in 1994, and 270 houses in 2000. Papagaran Village is similar in size, with 258 families totaling 1,078 people. At the 2010 Census, Komodo Village had 1,508 inhabitants and Papagaran Village had 1,262 inhabitants. As of 1999, Rinca‚Äôs population was 835, and Kerora's population was 185 people. The total population currently living in the park is 3,267 people with 16,816 people live in the area immediately surrounding the park. Education The average level of education in the villages of Komodo National Park is grade four of elementary school. There is an elementary school located in each of the villages but new students are not admitted each year. On average, each village has four classes and four teachers. Most of the children from the small islands in the Kecamatan Komodo (Komodo, Rinca, Kerora, Papagaran, Mesa) do not finish elementary school. Less than 10% of those who do graduate from elementary school continue to high school since the major economic opportunity (fishing) does not require further education. Children must be sent to Labuan Bajo to attend high school, but this is rarely done in fishermen's families. Health Most of the villages located in and around the park have few fresh water facilities available, if any, particularly during the dry season. Water quality declines during this time period and many people become ill. Malaria and diarrhea are rampant in the area. On Mesa island, with a population of around 1,500 people, there is no fresh water available. Fresh water is brought by boat in jerrycans from Labuan Bajo. Each family needs an average of Rp 100,000.- per month to buy fresh water (2000). Almost every village has a local medical facility with staff, and at least a paramedic. The quality of medical care facilities is low. Socio-cultural and anthropologic conditions Traditional Customs: Traditional communities in Komodo, Flores and Sumbawa have been subjected to outside influences and the influence of traditional customs is dwindling. Television, radio, and increased mobility have all played a part in accelerating the rate of change. There has been a steady influx of migrants into the area. At the moment nearly all villages consist of more than one ethnic group. Religion The majority of fishermen living in the villages in the vicinity of the park are Muslims. Hajis have a strong influence in the dynamics of community development. Fishermen hailing from South Sulawesi (Bajau, Bugis) and Bima are mostly Muslims. The community from Manggarai are mostly Christians. Anthropology and language There are several cultural sites within the park, particularly on Komodo Island. These sites are not well documented, however, and there are many questions concerning the history of human inhabitance on the island. Outside the park, in Warloka village on Flores, there is a Chinese trading post remnant of some interest. Archeological finds from this site have been looted in the recent past. Most communities in and around the park can speak Indonesian. Bajo language is the language used for daily communication in most communities. Conflicts between conservationists and local community Controversy surrounds the death of several fishermen since the 1980s. The circumstances of the fishermen‚Äôs deaths are contested. While park patrols (including, at the time, police and navy personnel) claim they acted in self- defense, fishing communities accuse park management of having deliberately killed the fishermen.Down to Earth 2003 In late February 2014, Brimob Special Police shot dead two poachers, when they opened fire with their homemade firearms. The poachers attempted to hunt deer in the park which fall prey to Komodo dragons. Tourism Kanawa Island, a tourist island in the Komodo National Park. Scuba diving is popular because of the park's high marine biodiversity.Novia D. Rulistia, 'Under the seas in Komodo,' The Jakarta Post, 26 June 2013. The development of, largely marine-based, ecotourism is the main strategy to make the park self-financing and generate sufficient revenue through entrance fees and tourism licenses to cover operational and managerial costs. To this end, a joint venture between TNC and a tourism operator were granted a tourism concession, that also entails extensive park management rights.PKA & TNC 2000:78 This concession has generated an ongoing controversy. The joint venture has been accused of making decisions behind closed doors, and many people in and around Komodo claim that they haven't been consulted regarding decisions that ultimately affect their lives.WALHI 2003, Dhume, 2000, Jurassic Showdown‚Äô, Far Eastern Economic Review, March 16th, pp.50‚Äì52 Komodo Island and Rinca were once part of Flores and they are separated from the large Island of Sumbawa to the West by the Sape Strait. The ocean in the Strait drops hundreds of meters. The Pacific Ocean to the north and the Indian Ocean to the south are actually at different heights ‚Äì so the flow of currents from the Pacific to the Indian during tidal exchanges makes the currents among the strongest in the world. In the (relatively) shallow waters along the east coast of Komodo towards Labaun Bajo, these currents can be extremely dangerous with inexperienced guides. The number of visitors to the park increased from 36,000 in 2009 to 45,000 in 2010. Most of the visitors were foreign tourists as the high transport cost to this remote location is less affordable for local visitors. The park can accommodate up to 60,000 visitors a year according to the local tourism agency.The Jakarta Post: Komodo Park attendance up by 9,000 in 2010, 24 July 2011 Several types of boat tours run through the national park including upscale scuba liveaboards, short daily snorkel trips and 4 day, 3 night 'tourist boats' between Lombok and Flores. The tourist boats run very frequently, but have uncertain safety records. In an August 2014 incident one of these tourist boats sank, and 2 tourists were lost. Strong currents and waves separated the stranded passengers and crew who were floating at sea in lifevests.Al Jazeera: \\"Tourists Missing after Indonesia Boat Sinks\\", 18 August 2014 Closure of the park In early 2019, the Nusa Tenggara Timor (NTT) provincial governor Viktor Laiskodat announced a plan to close a section of the park (a main section on Komodo Island) for a year in order to make improvements.'Komodo National Part to be close for one year for habitat restoration', The Jakarta Post, 21 January 2019. The suggestion was that other parts of the park, including Rinca and Padar Islands and certain parts of Komodo Island, would remain open. The governor's plan met with opposition from the local community and some parts of the wider public. In response, the Indonesian Environment and Forestry Minister, Siti Nurbaya said that she would summon representatives from the NTT administration for discussions, noting that decisions about conservation areas were under the jurisdiction of the central government. A final decision about the proposed closure was expected to be announced by the central government around mid-2019.Liza Yosephine, 'Government to go ahead with Komodo National Park closure in 2020', The Jakarta Post, 12 February 2019. In July 2019, it was confirmed that Komodo Island would be closed for around one year as from the beginning of 2020. Governor Laiskodat said that a budget of Rp 100 billion (around $US 7.2 million) would be provided to support the conservation program.'Komodo Island to be closed in 2020: Agency', The Jakarta Post, 18 July 2019. The plan is controversial: Governor Laiskodat has suggested that an expensive entrance fee be charged to foreign tourists while local villagers who live on Komodo Island are worried about the possible loss of income.Rebecca Henscheke and Callistasia Wijaya, 'The fight for Dragon Island', BBC World, 25 July 2019.

He belongs to the important discoverers in modern classical music, and major composers of microtonal music, especially using the quarter-tone scale, though he used others such as sixth-tones (e.g., in the 5th, 10th and 11th String Quartets), fifth-tones (Sixteenth String Quartet), and twelfth-tones. From the other mictrotonal conceptions, he discussed a \\"three-quarter tone\\" system (see three-quarter tone flat and the neutral second) in his theoretical worksMyles Lee Skinner, \\"Toward a Quarter- Tone Syntax: Analyses of Selected Works by Blackwood, Haba, Ives and Wyschnegradsky\\", PhD diss. (Buffalo: State University of New York at Buffalo, 2006; Ann Arbor: ProQuest/UMI, 2007), p. 15 .Patricia Strange and Allen Strange, The Contemporary Violin: Extended Performance Techniques (Berkeley, Los Angeles & London: University of California Press, 2001), p. 165. but he used scales in this tuning in sections of some of his compositions. In his prolific career, H√°ba composed three operas, an enormous collection of chamber music including 16 string quartets, piano, organ and choral pieces, some orchestral works and songs.Lubom√≠r Spurn√Ω and Ji≈ô√≠ Vyslou≈æil, Alois H√°ba: A Catalogue of the Music and Writings, trans. Paul Victor Christiansen (Prague: Koniasch Latin Press, 2010). He also had special keyboard and woodwind instruments constructed that were capable of playing quarter-tone scales.David Ewen, The World of Twentieth-Century Music (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1968).  Life  Alois H√°ba was born in the small town of Vizovice in Moravian Wallachia, into a family of 10 children. When he was five years old it was discovered that he had absolute pitch. He and his family often played and sang their native Wallachian folk songs, actively participated in church singing and folk-music performances. In school, Alois became very interested in the musical aspects of the Czech language, above all in pitch, rhythm, accent, dynamics, and timbre of the speech. In 1908 he entered the teacher's training college in Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ, where he began to develop an interest in Czech national music, analyzing the works of Bed≈ôich Smetana. Already at that time he found out from his textbooks that the European system of music was not the only one in the world and that even some European music had in the past used different scales than the ones used in his time. He therefore started to develop his own point of view in this issue. After finishing his studies, he got a job as teacher in B√≠lovice, a small town near the Hungarian (now Slovak) border. Simultaneously, he continued his own musical studies and in 1913 wrote his first compositions, displaying an unwillingness to \\"follow the rules\\", which he maintained all his life. H√°ba was dissatisfied by small-town life, and in 1914, he moved to Prague and became a pupil of neoromantic composer V√≠tƒõzslav Nov√°k. Here he was interested in analysing the works of Claude Debussy, Max Reger, Alexander Scriabin, and Richard Strauss, and in harmonization of Moravian folk music.  Vienna  During World War I, he served in the Austrian Army on the Russian and Italian front from 1915 until early 1918, when he was moved to Vienna, where he worked in the music department of the Austrian-Hungarian Ministry of War. There he almost immediately became a student of Franz Schreker, who brought out his more radical tendencies. At that time, H√°ba wrote his first quarter-tone piece, Suite, consisting of three fugues in the quarter-tone system, composed for two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart. Remaining in Vienna after the war, H√°ba attended the concerts produced by Arnold Sch√∂nberg's Verein f√ºr musikalische Privatauff√ºhrungen, and became particularly influenced by the \\"athematic\\" style used by Sch√∂nberg in his Erwartung. First publications of his compositions included the String Quartet No. 2, his first major quarter-tone work which was composed in 1920. At that time, his lifelong friendship with Hanns Eisler ‚Äì with whom he shared political beliefs (H√°ba became an ardent communist at this time) as well as musical opinions ‚Äì began.  Berlin  H√°ba found his first success as a composer in Berlin, where he followed his teacher Schreker in late 1920. He published his first theoretical treatise (in Czech), the small booklet Harmonick√© z√°klady ƒçtvrtt√≥nov√© soustavy (Harmonic Essentials of the Quarter-tone System). In 1923, he met Ferrucio Busoni, who had advocated the sixth-tone system and encouraged H√°ba to continue his work in microtonality. The same year, H√°ba began to attempt the establishment of a school of microtonal music, but as the Nazis started to gain power in Germany, he came under attack and was driven out of Berlin. He returned to Prague and managed to get a job teaching workshops at the Prague Conservatory.  Prague  In July 1923 at the festival of modern music in Donaueschingen, the Amar- Hindemith Quartet played H√°ba‚Äôs quarter-tone String Quartet No. 3\\\\. His name began to appear alongside other representatives of his generation‚Äôs avant- garde musicians and, thanks to him, Czechoslovakia became one of the first member countries of the International Society for Contemporary Music. H√°ba wrote several theoretical articles on microtonality, athematicism, and church modes at this time. In 1925 he wrote his major theoretical work New Harmony- Textbook of the Diatonic, Chromatic, Quarter-, Third-, Sixth-, and Twelfth- tone Systems (if necessary, see: diatonic, chromatic). He designed and had built two quarter-tone pianos by early 1924 and a third in 1925. In 1927, the Czech branch factory of the German piano firm August F√∂rster in the North Bohemian town of Ji≈ô√≠kov built for him a sixth-tone harmonium, patterned mostly after the design by Busoni. After the premiere of his quarter-tone opera Matka (Mother) in 1931, introducing a practically athematic concept, H√°ba emerged as a leader of Czech modernist music and became internationally well known as one of the most important avantgarde composers. This opera also uses two quarter-tone clarinets and two quarter-tone trumpets, which were built especially for this work. In 1934, he composed the opera Nov√° zemƒõ (The New Earth) in the twelve-tone system. Athematic constructions characteristic of his work appeared also later in the opera P≈ôijƒè kr√°lovstv√≠ tv√© (Thy Kingdom Come) (1940), which is written in the sixth-tone system.Editors of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Alois H√°ba: Czech Composer\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online (accessed 12 September 2016). In all three operas, H√°ba expressed his bold socialist viewpoint, that caused controversies already at the time. For instance, the production of Nov√° Zemƒõ (the plot of which deals with the Holodomor in Ukraine and how the Holodomor in a Ukrainian village is defeated by socialisation of production and founding the kolkhoz Nov√° Zemƒõ (The New Earth) by National Theatre in Prague in 1936 had to be cancelled by intervention from the Ministry of Culture as communist and pro-soviet propaganda. In 1933, when Josef Suk became director of the Prague Conservatory, H√°ba was made a full professor and established the Department of Quarter-tone and Sixth-tone Music. Here he had much influence over his many students. It was also the early 1930s that saw the writing of what is probably H√°ba‚Äôs most important orchestral work, the symphonic fantasy Cesta ≈æivota (The Path of Life). The 1930s also shaped H√°ba‚Äôs political stance and philosophy of life. His strong sense of social commitment found an intellectual basis in the anthroposophical teachings of Rudolf Steiner. In 1939 the German Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia and banned performance of H√°ba's work. They closed down the Prague Conservatory in 1941 and prevented him from teaching. During the war H√°ba wrote a continuation of his Theory of Harmony, completed, as already mentioned, a sixth-tone opera (which was never produced), and considered constructing a twelfth-tone harmonium. After World War II, he resumed teaching and held several administrative positions. At the turn of forties and fifties, the work of Alois H√°ba was affected by the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, becoming transitionally simplified, much more \\"thematic\\" and tonal, and also setting texts projecting communist ideology. He was nevertheless unable to rid himself of the label of ‚Äúformalist‚Äù stuck onto him by Marxist aesthetics. In 1953 he was sent into retirement, but in his own words it was only at that point that he achieved real creative freedom. In 1957 he was named an honorary member of the ISCM. When H√°ba returned to his style, he continued in his experimental musical studies, which culminated in the 1960s with the use of fifth tones in his Sixteenth String Quartet in 1967. This work was premiered in the same year at the ISCM festival in Prague, performing by Nov√°k Quartet. H√°ba was a prolific composer and continued to compose almost to the end of his life. He taught and influenced many musicians. Besides followers in his own country, H√°ba attracted students from southern Slavic countries (Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria), Lithuania, Turkey, and elsewhere. The Prague Conservatory in general enjoyed an international reputation, and a great deal of credit for that goes to the contacts and pioneering efforts of Alois H√°ba. Despite these facts, he died in relative obscurity in Prague in 1973.  Concept   Works  Alois H√°ba's works total 103 opuses, the majority of which are various kinds of chamber music. Among the most important are his string quartets, which document and demonstrate the development of his style. In addition to quarter tones, H√°ba used sixth-tones in his String Quartets nos. in the 5, 10, and 11, as well as in Six Pieces for Sixth-tone Harmonium or String Quartet (1928), Duo for Sixth-tone Violins (1937), Thy Kingdom Come, a Sixth-tone Musical Drama in Seven Scenes (1937‚Äì42), Suite in Sixth-tones for Solo Violin (1955), and Suite in Sixth-tones for Solo Cello (1955).

Its members are Yvonne Wilhelm, Christian H√ºbler and Alexander Tuchacek. They hold a professorship for Art and Media at the University of the Arts in Zurich. History Yvonne Wilhelm (born 1962), Christian Huebler (born 1962), Alexander Tuchacek (born 1962) are based in Zurich Switzerland. The Knowbotic Research group has experimented with the intersection of technology, information and knowledge, interface, immersive virtual reality and networked agency. In their work Simulation Mosaik Data Klaenge from 1993, they experimented with so called intelligent agent, applications which can conglomerate diaphanous information by themselves (also called knowbots) and intelligent virtual spaces (flexible information-environments distributed in electronic networks). Knowbotic Research KR+cF has regularly invited people from non-art fields to participate in their projects, such as scientists, philosophers and engineers, depending on the concept of each project. In partnership with the Academy of Media Arts Cologne, Knowbotic Research KR+cF has founded Membrane, a laboratory for media strategies, in 1995.Joseph Nechvatal, Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing. 2009, pp. 367-368 In their more recent work, they created media- based projects that try to intervene in the (physical or digital) public domain. Knowbotic is a coinage that combined ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù with ‚Äúrobot‚Äù, meaning intellectual agent on the Internet. Knowbotic has developed some projects themed on an information environment and a computer interface. Since 1998, it has become more flexible, and with these main three of them, different members from various fields such as art, science, and philosophy, have joined in each program. In 1997, it worked with Japanese art group, Canon Art Lab, in Tokyo. This project aimed at revealing the function of the city by interacting between real and virtual world.

At a young age, he helped his father in his transports company. He made history by designing the world's first successful manned rotary wing aircraft. Cornu first built an unmanned experimental design powered by a 2 hp Buchet engine. His manned helicopter was powered by a Antoinette engine.eurocopter.com He piloted this construction himself at Normandy, France on November 13, 1907. Previously, a French helicopter, the Breguet-Richet Gyroplane I, had managed to lift off under its own power, but it had been held in position by men standing on the ground. Cornu's performance was a considerable progress because his aircraft flew without additional support and lifted Cornu about 30 cm (1 ft) for 20 seconds . Unfortunately this early helicopter was scarcely maneuverable and had only a few additional flights. The construction was not much further developed by this technical pioneer, who had to keep on making a living by manufacturing bicycles.

Documented use of the term dates back to the Mishnaic period (ca. 10220 CE). Since medieval times, kabbalistic literature has broadened use of the term. In the modern era, among the post-Haskalah movements, tikkun olam is the idea that Jews bear responsibility not only for their own moral, spiritual, and material welfare, but also for the welfare of society at large. For many contemporary pluralistic rabbis, the term refers to \\"Jewish social justice\\" or \\"the establishment of Godly qualities throughout the world\\". History The earliest use of the term tikkun olam comes in the phrase mip'nei tikkun ha-olam, \\"for the sake of repairing the world\\", which appears in the Mishnah Mishnah, Gittin 4:2 with the meaning of amending the law in order to keep society well-functioning. More generally, tikkun can mean improvement, establishment, repair, prepare, and more. In the Mishnaic context it refers to practical legal measures taken in the present to ameliorate social conditions. A conception of tikkun olam is also found in the Aleinu, a concluding part of most Jewish congregational prayer, which in contrast to the Mishnah's usage, focuses on the end of time. The Aleinu beseeches God: : Hebrew: \\"\\" : Translation: \\"to speedily see Your mighty splendor, to cause detestable (idolatry) to be removed from the land, and the (false) gods will be utterly 'cut off', to takein olam ‚Äì fix/repair/establish a world ‚Äì under the Almighty's kingdom\\" In other words, when all the people of the world abandon false gods and recognize God, the world will have been perfected. A common but more modern understanding of this phrase is that we share a partnership with God, and are instructed to take the steps towards improving the state of the world and helping others, which simultaneously brings more honor to God's sovereignty. Some scholars have argued that the Aleinu prayer is actually not a valid source for the concept of tikkun olam, claiming that the original prayer used a homonym \\"l'takhen\\" (spelled differently, ) meaning \\"to establish\\" rather than \\"to fix\\" or \\"to repair\\". However, the standard and almost universally accepted spelling of ◊ú◊™◊ß◊ü can also mean establish, and the reading of l'taken ◊ú◊™◊ß◊ü became altogether normative by the time of the Rishonim and influenced all further evolution of the concept of tikkun olam since the beginning of the previous millennium if not earlier. Therefore, the question of which version of Aleinu is original only affects whether we date Aleinu's influence on tikkun olam to the 3rd century or the 11th century, but not whether it was a determinative influence in tikkun olam's evolution. Over the course of Jewish intellectual history, tikkun olam has at times referred to eschatological concerns, as in Aleinu, and at times to practical concerns, as in the Mishnah, but in either context, it refers to some kind of social change or process that is for the betterment of society or humanity or the world. Whether that happens primarily within Jewish society or primarily in relation to the nations of the world, whether that happens primarily through acts of justice and kindness, or equally through ritual observance, whether primarily through internal work of an individual or through external deeds, is something that changes from one source to the next.See Seidenberg, David, \\"A Tikkun for Tikkun Olam?\\" For example, Talmudic scholar and eminent philosopher of the Middle Ages, Maimonides saw tikkun olam as fully inclusive of all these dimensions when he wrote \\"Through wisdom, which is [represented by] Torah, and the elevation of character, which is [represented by] acts of kindness, and observing the Torah‚Äôs commandments, which are [represented by] the sacrifices, one continuously brings tikkun olam improvement of the world, and the ordering of reality.\\"commentary on Pirkei Avot, 1:2 Yet he also saw justice as a fundamental component, as for example when he wrote, \\"Every judge who judges truth unto its [deepest] truth, even for one hour, it‚Äôs as if he fixed the whole world entirely / tikein et kol ha‚Äôolam kulo and caused the Shekhinah to rest upon Israel.\\" Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Sanhedrin 23:9 Furthermore, the original context of the Aleinu prayer, in the Rosh Hashanah liturgy, is accompanied by the hope that \\"all [the people/creatures] will form a single union to do Your will with a whole heart\\". In many contexts this is interpreted to be a call to universalism and justice for all mankind ‚Äì sentiments which are common throughout Jewish liturgy. For example, in the American Conservative movement's prayer book, Siddur Sim Shalom, published by the Rabbinical Assembly and the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, \\"A Prayer for Our Country\\" elaborates on this passage: \\"May citizens of all races and creeds forge a common bond in true harmony to banish all hatred and bigotry\\" and \\"uniting all people in peace and freedom and helping them to fulfill the vision of your prophet: 'Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they experience war anymore. Both lines express wholeheartedly the idea of universal equality, freedom, and peace for all. In the liberal movements of Judaism, most especially in the United States, this sentiment is especially embedded in the idea of acting compassionately for all people, as for example in the 1975 New Union prayer book, used by the movement for Reform Judaism Gates of Prayer, which includes the text \\"You [Lord] have taught us to uphold the falling, to heal the sick, to free the captive, to comfort all who suffer pain\\".p.383 These aspects of Judaism already have a traditional name however, gemilut chasadim, and some have criticized the tendency to emphasize social action as a kind of disregard for other aspects of Judaism traditionally connected to tikkun olam, like learning, prayer, repentance, and ritual commandments. Lurianic Kabbalah Lurianic Kabbalah dwells on the role of prayer and ritual in tikkun of the upper worlds. According to this vision of the world, God contracted part of God's infinite light (Ohr Ein Sof)‚Äîconcealing Himself‚Äîto create the world. The vessels (kelim) of the first universe‚ÄîOlam HaTohu, i.e., the \\"world of chaos\\"‚Äîshattered (Shevirat HaKelim) and their shards became sparks of light (ne·∫ìu·∫ìot) trapped within the next universe‚ÄîOlam HaTikun, i.e., \\"the world of rectification.\\" Prayer, especially contemplation of various aspects of the divinity (sephirot), releases these sparks of God's light and allows them to reunite with God's essence. The ‚Äúrectification‚Äù is two-fold: the gathering of light and of souls, to be achieved by human beings through the contemplative performance of religious acts. The goal of such repair, which can only be effected by humans, is to separate what is holy from the created world, thus depriving the physical world of its very existence, destroying the material universe. This restores all things to a world before disaster within the Godhead. According to Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, in his book Derech Hashem, the physical world is connected to spiritual realms above that influence the physical world, and furthermore, Jews have the ability, through physical deeds and free will, to direct and control these spiritual forces. God's desire in creation was that God's creations ultimately will recognize God's unity and overcome evil; this will constitute the perfection (tikkun) of creation. While the Jews have the Torah now and are aware of God's unity, some believe that when all of humanity recognizes this fact, the rectification will be complete.Derech Hashem, II:4:6-7. In recent years Jewish thinkers and activists have used Lurianic Kabbalah to elevate the full range of ethical and ritual mitzvot into acts of tikkun olam. The belief that not only does prayer lift up divine sparks, but so do all of the mitzvot, including those traditionally understood as ethical, was already a part of Kabbalah, but the contemporary emphasis serves the purpose of a finding mystical depth and spiritual energy in ethical mitzvot. The application of the Lurianic vision to improving the world can be seen in Jewish blogs, High Holiday sermons and on- line Jewish learning resource centers. The association between the Lurianic conception of tikkun and ethical action assigns an ultimate significance to even small acts of kindness and small improvements of social policy. However, this association can be a double-edged sword and has begun to trigger critique even within the social justice community. On one hand, seeing each action as raising a divine spark can motivate people to action by giving them hope that their actions will have long-term value. On the other hand, if this is done in a manner that separates the concept of tikkun olam from its other meanings as found in rabbinic literature and the Aleinu prayer, the risk of privileging actions that have no real significance and represent personal agendas is introduced. The application of Lurianic Kabbalah to ethical mitzvot and social action is particularly striking because Lurianic Kabbalah saw itself as repairing dimensions within the spiritual, the mystical worlds, rather than this world and its social relations. Author Lawrence Fine points to two features of Lurianic Kabbalah that have made it adaptable to ethical mitzvot and social action. First, he points out that a generation recovering from the tragedy of the Holocaust resonates with the imagery of shattered vessels. Second, both Lurianic Kabbalah and ethical understandings of tikkun olam emphasize the role of human responsibility and action. Performance of mitzvot  Jews believe that performing of ritual mitzvot (good deeds, commandments, connections, or religious obligations) is a means of tikkun olam, helping to perfect the world, and that the performance of more mitzvot will hasten the coming of the Messiah and the Messianic Age. This belief dates back at least to the early Talmudic period. According to Rabbi Yochanan, quoting Rabbi Shim'on bar Yochai, the Jewish people will be redeemed when every Jew observes Shabbat (the Sabbath) twice in all its details. This suggests that tikkun olam will prove successful with the coming of the Messiah and the Messianic Age.Shabbat, 118b. Observing Shabbat Some explain the power of Shabbat by its effect on the other six days of the week and their role in moving society towards the Messianic Age. Shabbat helps bring about the Messianic Age because Shabbat rest energizes Jews to work harder to bring the Messianic Age nearer during the six working days of the week. Because the experience of Shabbat gives one a foretaste of the Messianic Age, observance of Shabbat also helps Jews renew their commitment to bring about a world where love and mercy will reign. This relates to the section on the role of mitzvot (above) that suggests that tikkun olam will prove successful with the coming of the Messiah and the Messianic Age. Ethical behavior In Jewish thought, ethical mitzvot as well as ritual mitzvot are important to the process of tikkun olam. Maimonides writes that tikkun olam requires efforts in all three of the great \\"pillars\\" of Judaism: Torah study, acts of kindness, and the ritual commandments.Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishna, Avos 1:2 Some Jews believe that performing mitzvot will create a model society among the Jewish people, which will in turn influence the rest of the world. By perfecting themselves, their local Jewish community or the state of Israel, the Jews set an example for the rest of the world. The theme is frequently repeated in sermons and writings across the Jewish spectrum: Reconstructionist, Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox. Also, the mitzvot often have practical worldly/social effects (in contrast to mystical effects as held by Lurianic Kabbalah). Tzedakah Tzedakah is a central theme in Judaism and serves as one of the 613 commandments. Tzedakah is used in common parlance as charitable giving. Tzedek, the root of tzedakah, means justice or righteousness. Acts of tzedakah are used to generate a more just world. Therefore, tzedakah is a means through which to perform tikkun olam. Philanthropy is an effective tool in performing tikkun olam as it supports organizations that perform direct service. There are many different philanthropic organizations devoted to repairing the world. The United Jewish Federations of North America, one of the top ten charities in the world, counts tikkun olam as one of the three main principles under which it operates. Similarly, the American Jewish World Service supports grassroots organizations creating change in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The intersection between tzedakah, philanthropy, and tikkun olam is captured by Yehudah Mirsky in his article \\"Tikkun Olam: Basic Questions and Policy Directions\\". Mirsky writes: Building a model society By performing the mitzvot, it is believed that the Jewish people will become a model society. This idea sometimes is attributed to Biblical verses that describe the Jews as \\"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation\\" () and \\"a light of the nations\\" or \\"a light to the nations\\" ( and ). The philosophies of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch,This is a central theme in his philosophy of Torah im Derech Eretz and a common thread in all of his writings, especially The Nineteen Letters, Horeb, and his Pentateuch. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, and Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag are prominent in this field, the former rationally and in terms of a kehilla (community) of Jews in galut (the diaspora) influencing their non-Jewish neighbors, and the latter mystically and in Zionist terms of a Jewish state influencing the other nations of the world. Some other Orthodox rabbis, many but not all of them Modern Orthodox, follow a philosophy similar to Hirsch's, including Joseph H. Hertz,The Pentateuch and Haftorahs (London: Soncino Press, 1937). Isidore Epstein,The Faith of Judaism (London: Soncino Press, 1960). and Eliezer Berkovits.God, Man, and History (Jerusalem: Shalem Press, 1959). The philosophy of Religious Zionism follows Kook in his philosophy. In Modern Orthodox philosophy (which often is intertwined with Religious Zionism, especially in America), it is commonly believed that mitzvot have practical this-worldly sociological and educational effects on those who perform them, and in this manner, the mitzvot will perfect the Jews and the world. According to the rationalist philosophy of Hirsch and others, the social and ethical mitzvot have nearly self-explanatory purposes, while ritual mitzvot may serve functions such as educating people or developing relationships between people and God. As examples, prayer either inculcates a relationship between people and God or strengthens beliefs and faith of the one who prays, and keeping kosher or wearing tzitzit serve as educational symbols of moral and religious values. Thus, the ultimate goal of mitzvot is for moral and religious values and deeds to permeate the Jewish people and ultimately the entire world, but the ritual mitzvot nevertheless play a vital role in this model of tikkun olam, strengthening what is accomplished by the ethical. Hirsch's Horeb is an especially important source, as his exposition of his philosophy of the mitzvot. He classifies the mitzvot into six categories: * (1) toroth (philosophical doctrines); * The ethical mitzvot fall under (2) mishpatim and (3) chukim (commandments of justice towards (living) people and the natural world (including the human body itself) respectively) and (4) mitzvot (commandments of love); * The ritual mitzvot under (5) edoth (educational symbolic commandments) and (6) avodah (commandments of direct service to God). Aside from the fact that by perfecting themselves, the Jews set an example for the rest of the world, there is thus the additional distinction that mitzvot have practical, worldly effects‚Äîfor example, charity benefits the poor materially, constituting tikkun olam by its improvement of the world physically or socially, in contrast to the mystical effects of mitzvot as held by Lurianic Kabbalah. Improving the world According to Jewish scholar Lawrence Fine, the first use of the phrase tikkun olam in modern Jewish history in the United States was by Brandeis-Bardin Camp Institute founder Shlomo Bardin in the 1950s. Bardin interpreted the Aleinu prayer, specifically the expression le-taken olam be-malchut shaddai (typically translated as when the world shall be perfected under the reign of the almighty), as a responsibility for Jewish people to work towards a better world. However, while Bardin was a significant popularizer of the term, one also finds it being used in similar manner in the late 1930s and early 1940s by Alexander Dushkin and Mordecai Kaplan.The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion (1937), p. 124: \\"We cannot consider ourselves servants of the Divine King unless we take upon ourselves the task ‚Äòto perfect the World under the Kingdom of the Almighty.‚Äô We must strive to reconstruct the social order in ways that would give evidence of our allegiance to the creative spirit of human life, that spirit which makes for personal self-realization and social communion‚Ä¶We should not give up hope of achieving an adequately representative government integrally related to a righteous economic order and to an internationalism without which there can never be universal peace.\\" As left-leaning progressive Jewish organizations started entering the mainstream in the 1970s and 1980s, the phrase tikkun olam began to gain more traction. The phrase has since been adopted by a variety of Jewish organizations, to mean anything from direct service to general philanthropy. It was presented to a wide international audience‚Äîitself an indication of how widely tikkun olam had now permeated American Jewish life‚Äîwhen Mordecai Waxman used the phrase in a speech during Pope John Paul II's visit to the United States in September 1987. For some Jews, the phrase tikkun olam means that Jews are not only responsible for creating a model society among themselves but also are responsible for the welfare of the society at large. This responsibility may be understood in religious, social or political terms and there are many different opinions about how religion, society, and politics interact. Jane Kanarek, a Conservative rabbi, argues that discussions of tikkun olam in the Mishnah and Talmud point to the importance of creating systemic change through law. She concludes that contemporary tikkun olam should also focus on systemic and structural changes to society. While many non-Orthodox Jews have argued that tikkun olam requires socially liberal politics, some have argued for the validity of a conservative political approach to tikkun olam. Michael Spiro, a Reconstructionist Jew, draws on a conservative tradition that emphasizes free markets precisely because they believed that was the path to the greatest public good. In addition, conservatives have always emphasized the importance of private efforts of gemilut chasadim (benevolence) and tzedakah (charity or philanthropy), and Spiro argues that tikkun olam should be carried out through such private efforts rather than through government.Spiro, Michael. \\"Being a Politically Conservative Reconstructionist\\", Reconstructionism Today, Spring- Summer 2004, Volume 11, Number 3.  Jewish youth organizations  Tikkun olam is used to refer to Jewish obligations to engage in social action in the Reform and Conservative movements as well. For example, in USY, the Conservative youth movement, the position in charge of social action on chapter and regional boards is called the SA/TO (social action/tikkun olam) officer.United Synagogue Youth Furthermore, USY has the Abraham Joshua Heschel Honor Society. A requirement of acceptance to the honor society is to perform one act of community service a month. In NFTY, the American branch of Netzer Olami, the Reform youth movement, the position in charge of social action on chapter and regional boards is called the social action vice president (SAVP). In addition, other youth organizations have also grown to include tikkun olam has part of its foundation. BBYO has community service/social action commitments in both of its divisions, AZA and BBG. BBG includes two different programming areas specific to tikkun olam‚Äîone for community service, and another for social action. AZA includes a combined community service/social action programming area. In addition, both divisions include \\"pledge principles,\\" principles by which to guide them. For BBG girls the \\"menorah pledge principles\\" include citizenship, philanthropy, and community service. For AZA members, the \\"7 cardinal principles\\" include charity. Jewish fundamentalism Elon University professor Geoffrey Claussen has asserted that concepts of tikkun olam have inspired Jewish fundamentalists such as Meir Kahane and Yitzchak Ginsburgh. According to Claussen, \\"while visions of tikkun olam may reflect humility, thoughtfulness, and justice, they are often marked by arrogance, overzealousness, and injustice.\\"Geoffrey Claussen, \\"Pinhas, the Quest for Purity, and the Dangers of Tikkun Olam,\\" in Tikkun Olam: Judaism, Humanism & Transcendence, ed.

In masonry the pendentives thus receive the weight of the dome, concentrating it at the four corners where it can be received by the piers beneath.

W. Bush during the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. Early life Rodriguez came from a wealthy family of land owners in his native Cuba. His uncle was the Minister of Public Works during Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship. He attended the Perkiomen School in Pennsylvania but dropped out to join the Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean, which had been created by Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo with the intention of ending communism in Cuba. The invasion of Cuba was a failure, and Rodr√≠guez went back to Perkiomen. He graduated in June 1960 and went to live with his parents in Miami, where thousands of Cuban exiles had moved. In September 1960, he joined a group of Cuban exiles in Guatemala, supported by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to receive military training. They were called Brigade 2506. Bay of Pigs Invasion Rodriguez participated in the Bay of Pigs invasion as a paramilitary operations officer with the CIA's Special Activities Division (renamed Special Activities Center in 2016 https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/04/measuring-change-at-the-cia/). He clandestinely entered Cuba a few weeks before the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. Using his familiarity with the country, he was able to gather critical intelligence, which was used in the planning and preparation of the invasion.Woodward, Bob. 2002. Bush At War, Simon and Schuester, p. 317 Bolivia CIA authenticated the picture of Che Guevara and F√©lix Rodr√≠guez and recognizes it as original. In 1967, the CIA again recruited Rodr√≠guez to train and head a team to hunt down Che Guevara, who was attempting to overthrow the US-backed government in Bolivia and to replace it with a communist government. He and Guevara spoke civilly on the sluggish growth of the economy of Cuba and Guevara's tactics in starting a revolution in Bolivia. Rodr√≠guez stated that he wanted to keep Guevara alive for further interrogation but was thwarted by the order of the Bolivian president for Guevara to be summarily executed. Rodr√≠guez, whose cover was that of a Bolivian army major, repeated those orders and later stated it was a Bolivian decision for Guevara to be killed. Rodr√≠guez has in his possession Guevara's Rolex wristwatch.Andrea Billups and Kathleen Walter, Newsmax, 10 October 2013, On Anniversary of Che Killing, CIA's Felix Rodriguez Remembers The last photograph of Guevara alive includes Rodriguez standing by his side, but according to Dino Brugioni, a former senior official at the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC), it is a photomontage.Documentary alleges last photo of Che is fake Vietnam He became a US citizen in 1969. During his career with the CIA, he also went by the nom de guerre \\"Max Gomez\\" after M√°ximo G√≥mez, the Dominican general who fought in the Cuban War of Independence. He was awarded the Intelligence Star for Valor by the CIA and nine Crosses for Gallantry by the South Vietnamese government. He was codenamed Lazarus after his survival of the Bay of Pigs operation. During the Vietnam War, Rodr√≠guez flew over 300 helicopter missions and was shot down five times. In 1971, Rodr√≠guez trained Provincial Reconnaissance Units (PRUs). They were CIA-sponsored units that worked for the Phoenix Program.Douglas Brook's MA thesis, \\"The Phoenix Program: a Retrospective Assessment\\", Baylor University, 1989, pp. iv, 38‚Äì40, 50, 57, 60, 114‚Äì18, 127, 140‚Äì44, and 148‚Äì56. The Walsh Report states (Chapter 29): \\"During the Vietnam War, [Donald] Gregg supervised CIA officer Felix Rodriguez and they kept in contact following the war.\\"Walsh Iran / Contra Report - Chapter 29 Donald P. Gregg Rodr√≠guez also reported to Ted Shackley during the Phoenix Program. Shackley became Bush's top aide for operations when he directed the CIA, and Gregg later became National Security Advisor for Vice-President Bush. Rodr√≠guez was in frequent contact with him regarding arms for the Contras. In 1970, after the Cambodian incursion, Bien Hoa CIA Spymaster Orrin DeForrest worked with Rodr√≠guez, whom he described as \\"the CIA's hotshot pilot,\\" and his PRU in rolling up the Viet Cong stronghold of An Tinh in South Vietnam. Rodr√≠guez flew above the village in a Loach light helicopter and marked target houses holding VC suspects with orange smoke, and the PRU then went in and emptied the houses of occupants, lined them up, and identified suspects with the assistance of a former VC leader who had been captured before he began to co-operate with the CIA; DeForrest identified him as \\"Ba Tung.\\" The operation netted 28 VC cadre who had been living openly among the South Vietnamese but were working to assist the North Vietnamese overthrow their southern neighbors. The mass arrest and detention of Subregion One VC cadre was the largest operation of its type during the war and, for all intents and purposes, broke the VC hold on its stronghold of An Tinh.Slow Burn: The Rise and Bitter Fall of American Intelligence in Vietnam by Orrin DeForrest and David Chanoff (1990) pp. 127‚Äì29 Iran-Contra affair There is extensive documentation of Rodr√≠guez's ties to US Vice-President George H. W. Bush during the Iran‚ÄìContra affair from 1983 to 1988.Walsh Iran / Contra Report In September 1986, General John K. Singlaub wrote to Oliver North expressing concern about Rodr√≠guez's daily contact with the Bush office and warned of damage to US President Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party. The Walsh Report (Chapter 25) stated that M. Charles Hill took notes at a meeting between George Shultz and Elliott Abrams on 16 October 1986 as follows: > Felix Rodriguez [sic] - Bush did know him from CIA days. FR [Rodriguez] is > ex-CIA. In El Salv[ador] he goes around to bars saying he is buddy of Bush. > A y[ea]r ago Pdx [Poindexter] & Ollie [North] told VP staff stop protecting > FR as a friend - we want to get rid of him from his involvnt [sic] w[ith] > private ops. Nothing was done so he still is there shooting his mouth > off.Walsh Iran / Contra Report ‚Äì Chapter 25 United States v. Elliott Abrams > (brackets are in the original) Rodr√≠guez met with Donald Gregg, now Bush's National Security advisor. The Walsh Report (Chapter 29) stated, \\"Gregg introduced Rodriguez to Vice President Bush in January 1985, and Rodriguez met with the Vice President again in Washington, D.C., in May 1986. He also met Vice President Bush briefly in Miami on May 20, 1986.\\" Rodr√≠guez also met and spoke with Bush's advisor Gregg and his deputy, Colonel Samuel J. Watson III. On 5 October 1986, the Corporate Air Services C-123, carrying Eugene Hasenfus was shot down over Nicaragua, which killed two US pilots, William H. Cooper and Wallace B. Sawyer Jr., and one Latin American crewmember. \\"Rodriguez unsuccessfully attempted to call Gregg to inform him of the missing plane. He reached Watson, who in turn notified the White House Situation Room. The following day, Rodriguez called Watson again and told him that the airplane was one of North's.\\" Hasenfus told reporters that he worked for \\"Max Gomez,\\" an alias for Rodr√≠guez, and \\"Ramon Medina,\\" an alias for Luis Posada Carriles, of the CIA. On 10 October 1986, Clair George, the head of CIA clandestine operations, testified before Congress that he did not know of any direct connection between Hasenfus and Reagan administration officials. In the fall of 1992, George was convicted on two charges of false statements and perjury before Congress but was pardoned on Christmas Eve that year by President Bush.Walsh Iran / Contra Report ‚Äì Chapter 17 United States v. Clair E. George http://www.vheadline.com/readnews.asp?id=36375 Allegations regarding Kiki Camarena In October 2013, two former DEA agents and a pilot who allegedly flew for the CIA claimed to the Mexican journal Proceso and to the US network Fox News that the CIA had been \\"complicit\\" in the murder of DEA agent Enrique \\"Kiki\\" Camarena in 1985 and that Rodr√≠guez had played a role. The alleged motive for the crime was that Camarena had supposedly discovered that the US government had collaborated with the Guadalajara Cartel in the importation and the transfer of drugs from Colombia to the United States via Mexico to use the proceeds to sponsor the Contras in Nicaragua in its war against the Sandinista government. Phil Jordan, a former director of the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC); H√©ctor Berrellez, a former agent of the United States anti-drug administration who directed Operation Leyenda to clarify the murder; and Tosh Plumlee, allegedly a former pilot for the CIA, claim to have the evidence that the US government itself ordered the execution of Camarena. In July 2020, the documentary The Last Narc shows the testimonies of people like H√©ctor Berrellez, Phil Jordan, Mike Holm (a member of the DEA for 24 years), Manny Medrano (former assistant US Attorney and lead prosecutor in Camarena case) as well as Camarena's widow and three former police officers and former bodyguards of Ernesto Fonseca. The documentary explores the claims of the details of the torture and the interrogation, including some of the questions that Rodr√≠guez allegedly asked Camarena in relation to the association that the CIA had allegedly reached with the Guadalajara cartel to bring cocaine into the US, the final goal being to finance the Nicaraguan Contras. In 2013, Jack Lawn, a former head of the DEA, and retired Special Agent Jack Taylor, who investigated the murder, said the CIA had no involvement in Camarena's death. Without mentioning any agents by name, Jack Lawn also stated that \\"this is [a] fable not worthy of individuals who would serve in DEA.\\" A CIA spokesperson told Fox News that \\"it's ridiculous to suggest that the CIA had anything to do with the murder of a U.S. federal agent or the escape of his killer.\\" Activism Christopher Columbus High School in Miami. In 2004, Rodr√≠guez became president of the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association, a group for Bay of Pigs Invasion survivors.Brigada 2506 During the 2004 US presidential election, Rodr√≠guez was highly critical of the Democratic presidenial candidate, John Kerry, in part because of their previous meeting at a Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics hearing in 1987 during which Rodr√≠guez was questioned by Kerry about allegations of soliciting a $10 million donation from a Colombian cocaine cartel. The story, which was eventually shown to be false, had come from Ram√≥n Milian Rodr√≠guez, a convicted money launderer from Colombia. Rodr√≠guez referred to Kerry as \\"a liar and self-promoter\\" and said he \\"should not be President.\\" During the election, Rodr√≠guez campaigned strongly for George W. Bush, the Republican candidate. He admitted his main motivation was \\"to get the real word out about John Kerry.\\" Others accused him of seeking revenge against Kerry for the Kerry Committee Report.Felix Rodriguez: Kerry No Foe of Castro In 2005, Rodr√≠guez oversaw the opening of the Bay of Pigs Museum and Library in Little Havana, Florida, and became the chairman of the board of directors.http://www.bayofpigsmuseum.org/about_us.html References Autobiography * Rodriguez, Felix I. and John Weisman.

There have been instances in which an actor has been so strongly identified with a role as to make it difficult for them to find work playing other characters. Alternatively, a director may choose to cast an actor \\"against type\\" (i.e., in a role that would be unusual for that actor, to create a dramatic or comedic effect). Typecasting also occurs in other performing arts. An opera singer who has a great deal of success in one role, such as Denyce Graves as Carmen, may become typecast in that role. Actor selection Actors are selected for their roles either by a casting director, typically found in small productions, or, in larger productions such as motion pictures, through casting agencies. Extras and stand-ins are often drawn from the company Central Casting, a company so influential since its 1925 start, that some people refer to all cast as coming from \\"central casting\\". The concept of \\"central\\" casting was also widespread during the studio-dominated era (from the 1920s through the 1940s) when each studio had a larger number of actors on contract who were assigned to whatever films were being made at the time by that studio. Such centralized casting was made more efficient by placing an actor in subsequent similar character roles after his or her first success, especially if an actor was particularly well received in that role by the audience or by critics. Once typecast, an actor could make a bold impression by playing an atypical role \\"against type.\\" Early in Jack Lemmon's career, Fred Astaire advised him about the professional value of movie typecasting, telling Lemmon, \\"You're now at a level where you can only afford one mistake. The higher up you go, the more mistakes you're allowed. Right at the top, if you make enough of them, it's considered to be your style.\\" With character actors An actor is sometimes so strongly identified with a role as to make it difficult for them to find work playing other characters. It is especially common among leading actors in popular television series and films. Star Trek An example is the cast of the original Star Trek series. During Star Treks original run from 1966 to 1969, William Shatner was the highest paid cast member at $5,000 per episode ($ today), with Leonard Nimoy and the other actors paid much less. However, the press predicted that Nimoy would be a star after the series ended, and James Doohan expected that appearing on an NBC series would help his post-Star Trek career. The series so typecast the actors, however‚Äîas early as March 1970, Nichelle Nichols complained of Star Trek having \\"defined [her] so narrowly as an actress\\"‚Äîthat only Shatner and Nimoy continued working steadily during the 1970s, and even their work received little attention unless it was Star Trek-related. The others' income came mostly from personal appearances at Star Trek conventions attended by Trekkies; by 1978 DeForest Kelley, for example, earned up to $50,000 ($ today) annually. Residuals from the series ended in 1971 but in 1979, the first of six films starring the cast appeared; Kelley earned $1 million for the final film, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991). Parade stated of the cast in 1978 that \\"[They] lost control of their destinies the minute they stepped on the bridge of the make-believe Enterprise in 1966\\", and The New York Times observed in 1991 that \\"For most of the actors in the original \\"Star Trek\\" series, Starfleet has never been far off the professional horizons.\\" Being identified so closely with one role left the series' cast with mixed emotions; Shatner called it \\"awesome and irksome\\", and Walter Koenig called it \\"bittersweet\\" but admitted that there was \\"a certain immortality in being associated with Star Trek\\". Some of the Next Generation actors also became typecast. Patrick Stewart recalled that a \\"distinguished Hollywood director I wanted to work for said to me 'Why would I want Captain Picard in my movie?' That was painful\\". His most prominent non-Star Trek film or television role, Professor X of the X-Men film series, shares similarities to Jean-Luc Picard. Stewart has stated \\"I don't have a film career. I have a franchise career\\"; he continues to work on stage as a Shakespearean actor. However, The Next Generation had one of the largest budgets of its time, and the cast became very wealthy. Jonathan Frakes stated that \\"it‚Äôs better to be type-cast than not to be cast at all.\\" Michael Dorn said in 1991, \\"If what happened to the first cast is called being typecast, then I want to be typecast. Of course, they didn't get the jobs after 'Trek.' But they are making their sixth movie. Name me someone else in television who has made six movies!\\" The movie Galaxy Quest depicts a group of former actors on a Star Trek-like television series who now make publicity appearances in character, such as opening stores and malls. Except for the captain (Tim Allen), who was comfortably retired, the cast members constantly complain about how they cannot find serious and appropriate roles because of typecasting. Other examples John Larroquette said that after winning four Emmy Awards in a row, \\"it was 10 years after Night Court ended before I got a role as a dad. Because Dan Fielding was such a bizarre character, he had made such an impression, that typecasting does happen. Every role was some sleazy lawyer or some sleazy this or some sleazy that.\\" During his years on the comedy Married... with Children, Ed O'Neill's scenes were cut from the film drama Flight of the Intruder (1991) after a test audience laughed when he was on the screen. Jon Hamm stated that after the success of Mad Men, he received \\"about 40 scripts that were all set in the 60s, or had me playing advertising guys\\" like his character Don Draper. Adam West as Batman in the 1966 series of the same name is another prominent example. Clayton Moore and George Reeves, who played the Lone Ranger and Superman, respectively, in the Golden Age of Television, were also victims of typecasting. Reeves' typecasting was so pervasive that an urban legend grew around his role in From Here to Eternity, which claimed that his major role was practically removed from the film after test audiences shouted \\"There's Superman!\\" whenever he appeared. (In reality, there were no test screenings, and no scenes from Reeves' minor role were cut from the final version. The article on Hollywoodland, a fictionalized account of Reeves' death, discusses this issue.) Ben McKenzie agreed with Frakes about typecasting. He became a star in the role of Ryan Atwood in The O.C. at age 24, after two years of seeking acting work in New York and Los Angeles. Eleven years later, after starring in two more television series playing what The New York Times described as a \\"quiet, guarded leading man\\", McKenzie said \\"if you are being stereotyped, that means you have something to stereotype. So they‚Äôre casting you. That is an amazing thing. That is a gift. Worry about being pigeonholed in your 50s.\\" Typecasting was a greater threat to an actor's long- term financial security prior to the 1970s when television actors were generally paid less and did not receive residuals from television series being repeated in syndication. While the careers of actors in such series such as Star Trek and Gilligan's Island suffered from overexposure due to their previous series being aired ubiquitously they were no longer being paid while at the same time being unable to find new acting jobs. Ted Knight nearly considered leaving The Mary Tyler Moore Show because of the dopey character of Ted Baxter; in fact after the Moore show, Knight had a successful career as a non-Ted Baxter comedic character such as in Caddyshack and Too Close for Comfort. Leslie Nielsen was twice typecast in his career. Through the 1970s, he had earned a reputation as a stern leading man in films such as Forbidden Planet (1956) and The Poseidon Adventure (1972). In 1980, he was cast against type in the spoof film Airplane! for his ability to deadpan as a straight man. Nielsen embraced his career as a comic actor for the rest of his life. Daniel Radcliffe has been typecast as Harry Potter, he played the role of the main protagonist in all eight movies of the franchise. Radcliffe was faced with two transitions, that of moving from child actor to adult star and from being typecast as Harry Potter to playing other roles. Ronald Reagan, known for playing good guys, played mobster Jack Browning in The Killers (1964), his last film role. Historical-real characters Soviet actor Mikheil Gelovani depicted Joseph Stalin in 12 films made during the leader's lifetime - among them The Great Dawn (1938), Lenin in 1918 (1939), The Vow (1946), The Fall of Berlin (1950) and The Unforgettable Year 1919 (1952) - which reflected his cult of personality; those films were either banned or had the scenes featuring Stalin removed after the 1956 Secret Speech. Following Stalin's death, Gelovani was denied new roles, since he was identified with the dead premier. According to The Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats, Gelovani had probably portrayed the same historical figure more than any other actor.. Page 105. Die Zeit columnist Andreas Kilb wrote that he ended his life \\"a pitiful Kagemusha\\" of Stalin's image. Playing within type Some actors embrace typecasting. Fans often expect a particular actor to play a \\"type\\", and roles which deviate from what is expected can be commercial failures. This beneficial typecasting is particularly common in action movies (e.g., Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Steven Seagal, Vin Diesel, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger) and comedies (Charlie Chaplin, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Julia Roberts) but much less common in drama, although many B-list and C-list character actors make careers out of playing a particular dramatic type, and it is often suggested to would-be actors that they audition for roles that fit their \\"type\\". In opera, especially in German-speaking countries, the Fach system is used to categorize singers based on their voice type to aid in the casting process. Playing against type Some actors attempt to escape typecasting by choosing roles that are opposite the types of roles that they are known for; alternatively, a director may choose to cast an actor in a role that would be unusual for them to create a dramatic or comedic effect. This is called \\"playing against type\\" or \\"casting against type\\". Notable examples include: * Otto Kruger, known for playing villains, played the heroic lead in Dracula's Daughter (1936). * Basil Rathbone, known for playing villains, played the lead in Son of Frankenstein (1939) and then as Sherlock Holmes in fourteen films (1939-1946). * James Cagney, known for his \\"tough guy\\" persona, was cast as George M. Cohan in Michael Curtiz's Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) * Fred MacMurray, known for starring in romantic comedies, played a serious role as an insurance salesman conspiring with another man's wife to murder her husband in Double Indemnity (1944). * Dick Powell, known for his musical roles, played Phillip Marlowe in Murder, My Sweet (1944). * Henry Daniell, known for playing villains, played the lead in The Body Snatcher (1945). * Charlie Chaplin, famed for his endearing 'Little Tramp' character, portrayed a bigamous serial killer in the darkly-themed movie Monsieur Verdoux (1947). * James Dean took the role of rancher Jett Rink in Giant (1956) in an effort to avoid being typecast as a rebellious teenager. * Bob Hope, known for his comedic roles played corrupt politician Jimmy Walker in Beau James (1957). * Donna Reed and Deborah Kerr, both known for playing straight-laced women, were respectively cast as a prostitute and an adultress in From Here to Eternity (1953). * While James Stewart was known for his \\"affable\\" everyman roles, such as a businessman and father in It's a Wonderful Life, in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958), he was cast against type as a \\"troubling or unsettling\\" character whose \\"mind unravels\\" until he attains a \\"cold, chilling air of sexual paranoia and control.\\" * Sergio Leone casting Henry Fonda, best known for playing morally upright, everyman heroes, as a sadistic villain in the Western Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). * John Wayne, known for playing heroic cowboys/lawmen played antihero Rooster Cogburn in True Grit (1969). Wayne was cast against type several times in his career, including Genghis Khan in The Conqueror (1956)Weiler, A. H. (March 31, 1956). \\"Screen: 'The Conqueror'\\". The New York Times. 13. and a Roman centurion in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), usually to major derision. * Sidney Lumet casting Vin Diesel, known for his action film roles, as the leading role in the courtroom drama Find Me Guilty (2005) * Tim Burton casting Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the dark action-drama Batman (1989), when Keaton had previously starred primarily in successful feel-good comedies. * Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith were cast as the main bad guys in Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop (1987), where they had previously been known for playing \\"fatherly\\" \\"nice guy\\" and \\"more intellectual\\" roles, respectively.Villains of Old Detroit. Featurette. 2007, RoboCop 20th Anniversary DVD. * Matthew McConaughey, who, after making several romantic comedies, sought other, more dramatic film roles. He appeared in a supporting role in The Wolf of Wall Street and starred in Interstellar and Dallas Buyers Club, receiving critical acclaim in all three films and winning the Academy Award for Best Actor for the latter. This change in the direction of his career is now called The \\"McConaissance\\", and is considered by many to be amongst the greatest career turnarounds. * Michael Mann cast Tom Cruise, typically known for playing heroes, as an amoral hitman in Collateral (2004). * Taylor Negron who was best known for his comedic roles, was cast against type as a ruthless henchman in The Last Boy Scout (1991). * While Matt Damon was at first best known for his dramatic performance skills, as seen in Good Will Hunting (1997), he was cast against type as an action movie hero in the Jason Bourne films. * Adam Sandler is best known for his comedy roles, in which he typically plays an \\"aggressive man- child\\". However, director Paul Thomas Anderson cast Sandler against type in Punch-Drunk Love (2002), as a man facing psychosis who goes \\"from understated sorrow to rage and back again.\\" He again returned to serious work in The Meyerowitz Stories (2017), with Variety writing of his role: \\"with no shtick to fall back on, Sandler is forced to act, and it‚Äôs a glorious thing to watch.\\" He later starred in the 2019 film Uncut Gems as a charismatic New York jeweler. His performance was critically acclaimed. * Robin Williams was a successful comedian and situation comedy actor. He was cast against type in Insomnia and One Hour Photo (both 2002), two movies in which he depicted \\"spine-chilling psychosis\\" and insanity. He also portrayed a manipulative man who imitated the 1961 Milgram experiment in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. His best-known dramatic role was Dr. Sean Maguire in the 1997 film Good Will Hunting, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. * Tony Curtis was known as \\"Hollywood's most handsome matinee idol\\"; as such, he was cast against type when he played serial killer Albert DeSalvo in The Boston Strangler. (1968) * Jamie Lee Curtis is a former scream queen who was cast in horror films including Halloween (1978) and The Fog (1980). She was cast against type in comedies and dramas starting with Trading Places (1983). * Jack Black was best known for comedy roles, but took the lead role of Carl Denham in the remake of King Kong (2005). * Kajol was best known for playing Bollywood heroines. She took the role of playing an obsessive lover and killer in the movie Gupt: The Hidden Truth (1997). She became the first woman to receive the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role. * Tyler Perry is a comedian that was best known for creating and portraying Madea, a tough elderly black woman. He went against-type when he was cast as Tanner Bolt, a lawyer that specialized in defending men accused of killing their wives, in Gone Girl (2014). * Niecy Nash is well known for her work in comedies both in film and television. She was cast against type as Delores Wise in the 2019 Netflix limited series When They See Us which earned her an Emmy nomination for lead actress. * Following her film debut Kangana Ranaut became known for playing obsessive, neurotic characters. She broke the typecast mould with the comedies Tanu Weds Manu (2011), Queen (2014), and Tanu Weds Manu: Returns (2015), with the last two films earning her two consecutive National Film Awards for Best Actress * Despite the fact that Jackie Chan had already explored non-comedic roles in Hong Kong films multiple times throughout his career such as in 1993's Crime Story and 2009's Shinjuku Incident, he was mostly known in the west to star in light kung fu action films until he took the lead role in the movie The Foreigner (2017) as a character who traveled to Ireland to seek vengeance for his daughter‚Äôs murder in a bombing. Pierce Brosnan is cast alongside Chan and deviates from his usual performances (he was best known for his suave Englishman roles such as James Bond and Remington Steele) by playing a former member of a terrorist organization who's become a part of the Northern Irish government, with a bad temper yet an inability to harm or kill those he interrogates. Additionally, Chan has increasingly starred in non-martial arts roles in recent years due to his advancing age and repeated stunt injuries. * Robert Pattinson, best known for his work on the Twilight series of fantasy romance films, was cast against type in the Safdie brothers‚Äô crime thriller Good Time (2017), playing a bank robber. Pattinson received critical acclaim for the role. He was also cast alongside Willem Dafoe in The Lighthouse as two lighthouse keepers who slowly start to lose their sanity. Both were critically acclaimed for their performances. * Chris Hemsworth is best known for playing the Marvel superhero Thor in multiple films as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He was cast against type as the character Billy Lee, a sadistic but charismatic cult leader in the 2018 film Bad Times at the El Royale. * Heath Ledger was best known for his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in the 2005 romantic drama film Brokeback Mountain. He was later cast as the Batman villain The Joker in Christopher Nolan‚Äôs 2008 film The Dark Knight. His performance earned him a posthumous Academy Award. In a few cases, an initial casting against type may lead to being typecast in a different style altogether. For instance, Leslie Nielsen had an established career as a dramatic actor since the 1950s before appearing in the successful comedy film Airplane! (1980) specifically due to the gravitas he could bring to the satire. The last half of his career saw him mostly in comedic roles.

History Wiebe was born at Speedwell, near Fairholme, Saskatchewan, in what would later become his family's chicken barn. For thirteen years he lived in an isolated community of about 250 people, as part of the last generation of homesteaders to settle the Canadian west. He did not speak English until age six since Mennonites at that time customarily spoke Low German at home and standard German at Church. He attended the small school three miles from his farm and the Speedwell Mennonite Brethren Church. He received his B.A. in 1956 from the University of Alberta and then studied under a Rotary International Fellowship at the University of T√ºbingen in West Germany, near Stuttgart. In Germany, he studied literature and theology and travelled to England, Austria, Switzerland and Italy. In 1962, he received a Bachelor of Theology degree from Mennonite Brethren Bible College in Winnipeg, now Canadian Mennonite University, where he also worked as the editor of the Mennonite Brethren Herald, a position he was asked to leave after the publication of his controversial debut novel Peace Shall Destroy Many (1962). In addition to Peace Shall Destroy Many, Wiebe's novels include First and Vital Candle (1966), The Blue Mountains of China (1970), The Temptations of Big Bear (1973), The Scorched-wood People (1977), The Mad Trapper (1980), My Lovely Enemy (1983), A Discovery of Strangers (1994), Sweeter Than All the World (2001), and Come Back (2014). He has also published collections of short stories, essays, and children's books. In 2006 he published a volume of memoirs about his childhood, entitled Of This Earth: A Mennonite Boyhood in the Boreal Forest. Thomas King says of The Temptations of Big Bear that \\"Wiebe captures the pathos and the emotion of Native people at a certain point in their history and he does it well ... Wiebe points out to us that Canada has not come to terms with Native peoples, that there is unfinished business to attend to.\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia describes My Lovely Enemy as \\"a daring, experimental book involving a radical theology of love.\\" Wiebe taught at Goshen College in Goshen, Indiana from 1963 to 1967, and he has travelled widely. He is deeply committed to the literary culture of Canada and has shown a particular interest in the traditions and struggles of people in the Prairie provinces, both whites and Aboriginals. Wiebe won the Governor General's Award for Fiction twice, for The Temptations of Big Bear (1973) and A Discovery of Strangers (1994). He was awarded the Royal Society of Canada's Lorne Pierce Medal in 1986. In 2000 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2003 Wiebe was a member of the jury for the Giller Prize.  Personal life  In 1958 he married Tena Isaak, with whom he had two children.

Early life He attended the School of the Art Institute in Chicago, Illinois between 1921-1923. Personal life He became a nationally known illustrator before he became an author. After he began writing novels for young people, he moved his family to the North Carolina mountains, and most of his books include that wild and rugged landscape. Literary work His novel Escape to Witch Mountain was made into a popular live-action film by Disney in 1975, 1995, and again in 2009. The sequel was made into another popular film in 1978. His novel The Incredible Tide became a popular anime series called Future Boy Conan in 1978. He is known for his portrayals of alien but human- looking people who have tremendously strong psychic/psionic abilities and a close communion with nature, and who can telepathically speak with animals. In his nonfiction book The Strange White Doves, he professed his belief that animals are conscious, thinking, feeling, perceiving, independent, and self- aware intelligent beings, and have subtle ways of communicating, perhaps via empathy or telepathy. The protagonists of Key's books are often ostracized, feared, or persecuted because of their astonishing abilities or extraterrestrial origins, and Key uses this as a clear metaphor for racism and other prejudice. In several of his novels (most notably The Case of the Vanishing Boy), Key portrays some sort of communal withdrawal from society by a group of like-minded individuals. Key sometimes depicted government- sponsored social services for children as inefficient or even counterproductive in its efforts: in The Forgotten Door, social services is presented as a clearly undesirable alternative for the protagonist Little Jon, and in Escape to Witch Mountain, Tony and Tia actively flee the system. In both cases, however, it is for a very logical reason: the characters are \\"not from around here.\\" All they want to do is go home and, happily, a few of us locals have the decency to help them do so (Key's The Forgotten Door predates E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial by over 10 years). The plot of Key's The Magic Meadow is even more poignant for any reader who has ever been bedridden in a hospital. Its ending in particular is phenomenally optimistic. That was another Alexander Key theme: that good and decent people deserve to escape to a place worthy of them.

G. (1968). The advanced theory of statistics. Hafner Publishing Company. The series are the same; but, the arrangement of terms (and thus the accuracy of truncating the series) differ.Kolassa, J. E. (2006). Series approximation methods in statistics (Vol. 88). Springer Science & Business Media. The key idea of these expansions is to write the characteristic function of the distribution whose probability density function is to be approximated in terms of the characteristic function of a distribution with known and suitable properties, and to recover through the inverse Fourier transform. Gram‚ÄìCharlier A series We examine a continuous random variable. Let \\\\hat{f} be the characteristic function of its distribution whose density function is , and \\\\kappa_r its cumulants. We expand in terms of a known distribution with probability density function , characteristic function \\\\hat{\\\\psi}, and cumulants \\\\gamma_r. The density is generally chosen to be that of the normal distribution, but other choices are possible as well. By the definition of the cumulants, we have (see Wallace, 1958) :\\\\hat{f}(t)= \\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\sum_{r=1}^\\\\infty\\\\kappa_r\\\\frac{(it)^r}{r!}\\\\right] and : \\\\hat{\\\\psi}(t)=\\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\sum_{r=1}^\\\\infty\\\\gamma_r\\\\frac{(it)^r}{r!}\\\\right], which gives the following formal identity: :\\\\hat{f}(t)=\\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\sum_{r=1}^\\\\infty(\\\\kappa_r-\\\\gamma_r)\\\\frac{(it)^r}{r!}\\\\right]\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(t)\\\\,. By the properties of the Fourier transform, (it)^r \\\\hat{\\\\psi}(t) is the Fourier transform of (-1)^r[D^r\\\\psi](-x), where is the differential operator with respect to . Thus, after changing x with -x on both sides of the equation, we find for the formal expansion :f(x) = \\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\sum_{r=1}^\\\\infty(\\\\kappa_r - \\\\gamma_r)\\\\frac{(-D)^r}{r!}\\\\right]\\\\psi(x)\\\\,. If is chosen as the normal density :\\\\phi(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma}\\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\frac{(x-\\\\mu)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}\\\\right] with mean and variance as given by , that is, mean \\\\mu = \\\\kappa_1 and variance \\\\sigma^2 = \\\\kappa_2, then the expansion becomes :f(x) = \\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\sum_{r=3}^\\\\infty\\\\kappa_r\\\\frac{(-D)^r}{r!}\\\\right] \\\\phi(x), since \\\\gamma_r=0 for all > 2, as higher cumulants of the normal distribution are 0. By expanding the exponential and collecting terms according to the order of the derivatives, we arrive at the Gram‚ÄìCharlier A series. Such an expansion can be written compactly in terms of Bell polynomials as :\\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\sum_{r=3}^\\\\infty\\\\kappa_r\\\\frac{(-D)^r}{r!}\\\\right] = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty B_n(0,0,\\\\kappa_3,\\\\ldots,\\\\kappa_n)\\\\frac{(-D)^n}{n!}. Since the n-th derivative of the Gaussian function \\\\phi is given in terms of Hermite polynomial as :\\\\phi^{(n)}(x) = \\\\frac{(-1)^n}{\\\\sigma^n} He_n \\\\left( \\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma} \\\\right) \\\\phi(x), this gives us the final expression of the Gram‚ÄìCharlier A series as : f(x) = \\\\phi(x) \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{n! \\\\sigma^n} B_n(0,0,\\\\kappa_3,\\\\ldots,\\\\kappa_n) He_n \\\\left( \\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma} \\\\right). Integrating the series gives us the cumulative distribution function : F(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^x f(u) du = \\\\Phi(x) - \\\\phi(x) \\\\sum_{n=3}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{n! \\\\sigma^{n-1}} B_n(0,0,\\\\kappa_3,\\\\ldots,\\\\kappa_n) He_{n-1} \\\\left( \\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma} \\\\right), where \\\\Phi is the CDF of the normal distribution. If we include only the first two correction terms to the normal distribution, we obtain : f(x) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma}\\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\frac{(x-\\\\mu)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}\\\\right]\\\\left[1+\\\\frac{\\\\kappa_3}{3!\\\\sigma^3}He_3\\\\left(\\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{\\\\kappa_4}{4!\\\\sigma^4}He_4\\\\left(\\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}\\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\,, with He_3(x)=x^3-3x and He_4(x)=x^4 - 6x^2 + 3. Note that this expression is not guaranteed to be positive, and is therefore not a valid probability distribution. The Gram‚ÄìCharlier A series diverges in many cases of interest‚Äîit converges only if f(x) falls off faster than \\\\exp(-(x^2)/4) at infinity (Cram√©r 1957). When it does not converge, the series is also not a true asymptotic expansion, because it is not possible to estimate the error of the expansion. For this reason, the Edgeworth series (see next section) is generally preferred over the Gram‚ÄìCharlier A series. The Edgeworth series Edgeworth developed a similar expansion as an improvement to the central limit theorem.Hall, P. (2013). The bootstrap and Edgeworth expansion. Springer Science & Business Media. The advantage of the Edgeworth series is that the error is controlled, so that it is a true asymptotic expansion. Let {Z_i} be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with mean \\\\mu and variance \\\\sigma^2, and let X_n be their standardized sums: :X_n = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{Z_i - \\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}. Let F_n denote the cumulative distribution functions of the variables X_n. Then by the central limit theorem, : \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} F_n(x) = \\\\Phi(x) \\\\equiv \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^x \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}q^2}dq for every x, as long as the mean and variance are finite. Now assume that, in addition to having mean \\\\mu and variance \\\\sigma^2, the i.i.d. random variables Z_i have higher cumulants \\\\kappa_r. From the additivity and homogeneity properties of cumulants, the cumulants of X_n in terms of the cumulants of Z_i are for r \\\\geq 2, : \\\\kappa_r^{F_n} = \\\\frac{n \\\\kappa_r}{\\\\sigma^r n^{r/2}} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_r}{n^{r/2 - 1}} \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{where} \\\\quad \\\\lambda_r = \\\\frac{\\\\kappa_r}{\\\\sigma^r}. If we expand in terms of the standard normal distribution, that is, if we set :\\\\phi(x)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\exp(-\\\\tfrac{1}{2}x^2), then the cumulant differences in the formal expression of the characteristic function \\\\hat{f}_n(t) of F_n are : \\\\kappa^{F_n}_1-\\\\gamma_1 = 0, : \\\\kappa^{F_n}_2-\\\\gamma_2 = 0, : \\\\kappa^{F_n}_r-\\\\gamma_r = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_r}{n^{r/2-1}}; \\\\qquad r\\\\geq 3. The Gram‚ÄìCharlier A series for the density function of X_n is now : f_n(x) = \\\\phi(x) \\\\sum_{r=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{r!} B_r \\\\left(0,0,\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_3}{n^{1/2}},\\\\ldots,\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_r}{n^{r/2-1}}\\\\right) He_r(x). The Edgeworth series is developed similarly to the Gram‚ÄìCharlier A series, only that now terms are collected according to powers of n. The coefficients of n-m/2 term can be obtained by collecting the monomials of the Bell polynomials corresponding to the integer partitions of m. Thus, we have the characteristic function as : \\\\hat{f}_n(t)=\\\\left[1+\\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{P_j(it)}{n^{j/2}}\\\\right] \\\\exp(-t^2/2)\\\\,, where P_j(x) is a polynomial of degree 3j. Again, after inverse Fourier transform, the density function f_n follows as : f_n(x) = \\\\phi(x) + \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{P_j(-D)}{n^{j/2}} \\\\phi(x)\\\\,. Likewise, integrating the series, we obtain the distribution function : F_n(x) = \\\\Phi(x) + \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{n^{j/2}} \\\\frac{P_j(-D)}{D} \\\\phi(x)\\\\,. We can explicitly write the polynomial P_m(-D) as : P_m(-D) = \\\\sum \\\\prod_i \\\\frac{1}{k_i!} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{l_i}}{l_i!}\\\\right)^{k_i} (-D)^s, where the summation is over all the integer partitions of m such that \\\\sum_i i k_i = m and l_i = i+2 and s = \\\\sum_i k_i l_i. For example, if m = 3, then there are three ways to partition this number: 1 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. As such we need to examine three cases: * 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 ¬∑ k1, so we have k1 = 3, l1 = 3, and s = 9. * 1 + 2 = 1 ¬∑ k1 \\\\+ 2 ¬∑ k2, so we have k1 = 1, k2 = 1, l1 = 3, l2 = 4, and s = 7. * 3 = 3 ¬∑ k3, so we have k3 = 1, l3 = 5, and s = 5. Thus, the required polynomial is : \\\\begin{align} P_3(-D) &= \\\\frac{1}{3!} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_3}{3!}\\\\right)^3 (-D)^9 + \\\\frac{1}{1! 1!} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_3}{3!}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_4}{4!}\\\\right) (-D)^7 + \\\\frac{1}{1!} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_5}{5!}\\\\right) (-D)^5 \\\\ &= \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_3^3}{1296} (-D)^9 + \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_3 \\\\lambda_4}{144} (-D)^7 + \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_5}{120} (-D)^5. \\\\end{align} The first five terms of the expansion are :\\\\begin{align} f_n(x) &= \\\\phi(x) \\\\ &\\\\quad -\\\\frac{1}{n^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}}\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{6}\\\\lambda_3\\\\,\\\\phi^{(3)}(x) \\\\right) \\\\ &\\\\quad +\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{24}\\\\lambda_4\\\\,\\\\phi^{(4)}(x) + \\\\tfrac{1}{72}\\\\lambda_3^2\\\\,\\\\phi^{(6)}(x) \\\\right) \\\\ &\\\\quad -\\\\frac{1}{n^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}}\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{120}\\\\lambda_5\\\\,\\\\phi^{(5)}(x) + \\\\tfrac{1}{144}\\\\lambda_3\\\\lambda_4\\\\,\\\\phi^{(7)}(x) + \\\\tfrac{1}{1296}\\\\lambda_3^3\\\\,\\\\phi^{(9)}(x)\\\\right) \\\\ &\\\\quad + \\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{720}\\\\lambda_6\\\\,\\\\phi^{(6)}(x) + \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{1152}\\\\lambda_4^2 + \\\\tfrac{1}{720}\\\\lambda_3\\\\lambda_5\\\\right)\\\\phi^{(8)}(x) + \\\\tfrac{1}{1728}\\\\lambda_3^2\\\\lambda_4\\\\,\\\\phi^{(10)}(x) + \\\\tfrac{1}{31104}\\\\lambda_3^4\\\\,\\\\phi^{(12)}(x) \\\\right)\\\\ &\\\\quad + O \\\\left (n^{-\\\\frac{5}{2}} \\\\right ). \\\\end{align} Here, is the j-th derivative of at point x. Remembering that the derivatives of the density of the normal distribution are related to the normal density by \\\\phi^{(n)}(x) = (-1)^n He_n(x)\\\\phi(x), (where He_n is the Hermite polynomial of order n), this explains the alternative representations in terms of the density function. Blinnikov and Moessner (1998) have given a simple algorithm to calculate higher-order terms of the expansion. Note that in case of a lattice distributions (which have discrete values), the Edgeworth expansion must be adjusted to account for the discontinuous jumps between lattice points.

The chart compares the true density, the normal approximation, and two Edgeworth expansions.

Discussion of results * For finite samples, an Edgeworth expansion is not guaranteed to be a proper probability distribution as the CDF values at some points may go beyond [0,1]. * They guarantee (asymptotically) absolute errors, but relative errors can be easily assessed by comparing the leading Edgeworth term in the remainder with the overall leading term.

The town is now a part of the large Borough of Gedling and has been fragmented into wards. The population of Carlton ward (a small portion of the original town) at the 2011 Census had a population of 6,881. The town was an urban district until 1974. The eight modern wards that comprised the urban district (Carlton Hill, Carlton, Cavendish, Colwick, Gedling, Netherfield, Phoenix and Porchester) together had an estimated population of 48,416 in 2015. This information is obtained from the Gedling borough council website.  History  In the Domesday Book of 1086, Carlton is referred to as Carentune. Like other parts of Nottingham, Carlton grew up with the textile industry in the 19th century. It is now mostly residential. Until 1950, Carlton was part of the Rushcliffe parliamentary constituency. It had its own eponymous constituency from 1950 until 1983, since when it has been in the Gedling constituency. In 1974, Carlton Urban District became part of the newly formed Borough of Gedling.  Geography  It is close to Bakersfield, Colwick, Gedling, Mapperley, Netherfield, Sneinton and St Ann's. It is near the River Trent and has an NG4 post code. Community The main shopping street is Carlton Hill, which has several shopping chains and smaller shops such as newsagents, chemists, and grocers. Carlton Square, the traditional centre of Carlton is today a shopping centre. There are numerous areas of grass for children to play on, as the roads tend to be quite busy. The King George V Recreation Ground is host a large playing field, a skatepark, a zip-line, and a children's playground. Carlton has two leisure centres: Richard Herrod Centre (an indoor bowling centre) on Foxhill Road and Carlton Forum (a swimming pool, gym and all-weather pitches) on Coningswath Road, off Cavendish Road. Carlton Laundry on Primrose Road is a Grade II listed building by Watson Fothergill. It was built in 1899 as a laundry and dye works.

A new school had been built on Foxhill Road/Carlton Hill and Carlton Central Primary School was relocated there. The new school had originally been intended to replace the deteriorating St. Paul's School on Carlton Hill. St Paul‚Äôs was closed in 1983 after many years and attempts to find a new site and financing for a new building were unsuccessful. Carlton Central Primary School is not the only primary school in Carlton. Amongst others, Porchester Junior School (which has recently been extended) is situated at the top of Standhill Road, while Carlton Standhill Infants School is at the opposite end of Standhill Road. Carlton has a number of pre schools & nurseries including Foxy Creeks Pre School (based in the Richard Herrod Centre, Foxhill Road), Good Foundations Day Nursery on Station Road and Little Bears Day Nursery on First Avenue. Carlton is home to the Midlands Academy of Dance and Drama (also known as MADD). It is one of the UK‚Äôs top musical theatre colleges. Religion St. Paul's Church, Carlton-in-the-Willows was built by Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon and consecrated in 1885. Located at the bottom of Carlton Hill, off Church Street, it is built in the style of a Roman Basilica and resides in the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham.

The stadium is home to the New Jersey Jackals of the independent Frontier League; the Montclair State Red Hawks baseball team, which competes in NCAA Division III; and the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center, which adjoins the stadium on its first base side. History Yogi Berra Stadium has a capacity of 5,000 persons with permanent seating of 3,784 people and lawn seating which holds an additional 1,500.http://www.funnj.com/sports/minors/ It is capable of holding overflow crowds with standing room and grass seating available in right field. These tickets are sold only in the event of an anticipated large crowd, such as on holidays or fireworks nights. Yogi Berra Stadium Construction of the stadium was done in conjunction with another venue on the Montclair State campus. Floyd Hall, a resident of Montclair who was then serving as chief executive officer of Kmart, donated money to the university in order to build an ice arena, which is known as Floyd Hall Arena and is a multi-use facility that several of the area's high school hockey teams call home, and a new baseball stadium for Montclair State's team to replace their previous venue, Pittser Field.About Floyd Hall Enterprises . Accessed July 27, 2007. Around this time the Northeast League, an independent minor baseball league, was looking for a team to replace the Bangor Blue Ox, which had folded. Hall bought into the league shortly thereafter and founded the Jackals, who were promptly given use of the new stadium once it was able to open. It was decided to name the stadium after Hall of Fame New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra, who called Montclair home during his playing days and managerial career with the Yankees and their crosstown rivals, the New York Mets. Despite construction delays keeping the Montclair State baseball team from using the new park (they remained at Pittser Field for one additional season; Pittser Field was then converted into a soccer only stadium), it opened for business in time for the Jackals' inaugural game on June 5, 1998. Despite the stadium only being partially finished, as construction on an addition continued throughout the season, fans hungry for economical entertainment flocked to the ball park for a fun night out, and the park is well-constructed with good sight lines and no obstructed views from any of its seats. The park's dimensions are 308 feet to each of the corner outfields and 398 to center field; according to the Jackals, this was done on purpose as another honor for Berra. An addition was constructed to house the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center, which features various baseball memorabilia from Berra's playing days and a reconstruction of the original scoreboard from Yankee Stadium among various other things. A skybox was constructed as part of the museum, and has very limited access. Berra was the primary user of the seats, as he made personal appearances at least twice per year to sign autographs for the fans until 2015; he died several days after the conclusion of that season. The Jackals have also allowed the skybox to be used by professional scouts attending games. The museum addition was completed following the 1998 season and the final phase of construction was completed in early 1999 as the seating areas were renovated and extended, with seats going as far as left and right field and several reserved sections being replaced with box seats, installation of several concession stands and a second set of restrooms, a new team store, and a resurfacing of the stadium's walls with white stucco. For many years, the stadium's official address was 1 Hall Drive, honoring the team's founder. In early 2016, as a further honor for its deceased namesake, the Jackals changed this to 8 Yogi Berra Drive. In 2018, the Jackals installed a new Daktronics HD LED video board in left field as part of stadium wide improvements. Entrance to Yogi Berra Stadium Accessibility issue Despite the popularity of the stadium in the summer months, since its construction Yogi Berra Stadium has been plagued with problems involving stadium accessibility. The stadium is located at the very top of an access road to the campus that was recently renamed for Berra and is now known as Yogi Berra Drive, which originates in neighboring Clifton on Valley Road and is only one-way going toward the stadium. The campus' two other entrances, on Normal Avenue in Montclair and Clove Road in Little Falls, both require fans to drive through portions of the campus to reach the stadium. The Normal Avenue entrance is on the opposite side of the campus and forces fans to drive down an extension of College Avenue, pass by the Panzer Athletic Center, Kasser Theater, admissions building, parking deck, and university police station to Carlisle Road, which runs into Quarry Road where the Clove Road campus entrance leads to and continues to the stadium. In addition, due to the Yogi Berra Drive ramp being closed to two way traffic, the only way to exit following games is to either take Clove Road, which leads to Route 46, or drive back across campus on Carlisle Road and exit via Normal Avenue. In addition, there is no public transportation that directly serves the stadium. New Jersey Transit buses and DeCamp Bus Lines service the parking deck, known as Red Hawk Deck, on the other side of campus and fans choosing to take the bus to the game can either walk from Red Hawk Deck across campus to the stadium or take one of the campus' shuttle buses which serve the shared parking lots the stadium uses. In addition, Montclair State's train station is located behind the stadium and is accessible via a walking path and staircase which puts fans within steps of the stadium gate. The campus shuttles also service the train station.

They are based on heavily modified Mercedes- Benz automotive engines. Design All Centurion engines are water-cooled, turbocharged, and employ a single-lever power control (SLPC) associated with a Full Authority Digital Engine Control system (FADEC). This simplifies engine management for the pilot, as well as improving reliability as it prevents the engine being operated improperly. The series utilizes either jet fuel or diesel fuel. The high compression ratio of the engine combined with the digitally controlled fuel injection system mirrors similar advances in automotive technology. Centurion series engines are always fitted with constant speed propellers which allow the engine to be operated at optimum speed at all times. However, the normal operating speed is too high for any suitable propeller and so the propeller is driven through a reduction gearbox. The constant speed propeller and reduction gear result in a propeller tip speed that is 10-15% lower than comparable conventional avgas engines, reducing propeller noise. The Diesel engine's high compression results in better fuel efficiency and the higher operating rpm of the Centurion allows higher power to be developed from a smaller displacement, in comparison to conventional aircraft piston engines. A Centurion engine complete with CSU, reduction gearbox, turbocharger and FADEC engine management system is considerably heavier than the more conventional Continental and Lycoming engines with which it competes, but this weight disadvantage is compensated by the Centurion's lower fuel consumption. Even though they lack the magnetos and spark plugs of conventional petrol (gas) piston engines, Centurion engines are considerably more complex.\\"Aero-TV: Doing It Diesel Style -- Glasair's New Diesel Offering\\" 29 August 2014.

He is best known as a member of the children's group the Wiggles and a member of the 1980s and 1990s pop band the Cockroaches. While still a teenager, he helped found the Cockroaches with his brothers, Paul and John. The Cockroaches recorded two albums and enjoyed moderate success, interrupted by Field's service in Australia's regular army, until they disbanded in the late 1980s. Field attended Macquarie University to receive training in early childhood education, and founded the Wiggles with fellow students Murray Cook, Greg Page and former bandmate Jeff Fatt in 1991. He worked as a preschool teacher for two years before the success of the Wiggles led him to focus on children's music full-time. Despite Field's strong dislike of touring, the Wiggles became one of the most successful and active groups in Australia. Field, whose signature color is blue while performing with the group, was responsible for the production aspects of their stage and television shows, CDs, and DVDs. His issues with chronic pain and depression, which almost forced him out of the group at the height of their success, are well-documented. After the departure of Cook, Fatt, and Page in 2012, he is the only remaining original Wiggle. Early life and education Field was born in Kellyville, New South Wales, Australia. He is the youngest of seven children, and grew up in north western Sydney. He came from a long line of musicians, especially the women in his family. His great-great aunt was \\"Queenie Paul\\", known for performing at the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney, and his grandmother Kathleen accompanied silent movies in the mining town of Cobar. Field's mother, Marie, made sure that all of her seven children learned how to play at least one musical instrument. He attended the all-boys boarding school St. Joseph's College, which his great-grandfather Paddy Condon, an Italian immigrant and master stonemason, helped build. In 1979, while they were students at St. Joseph's, he and his brothers Paul and John formed the pop group the Cockroaches. He was inspired by his sister Colleen to study early childhood education, and became convinced that teaching preschool children \\"was my calling\\".. He was also attracted to the profession's freedom, artistic nature, and lack of discipline, which was different from his experience in boarding school.Field admitted that another draw to the field was the fact that women outnumbered the men at Macquarie's program (Field, p. 21). Field put off university when the Cockroaches became successful, but he was dissatisfied with touring and plagued by \\"perhaps irrational, but very real, feelings of inadequacy and depression\\". By his mid-twenties, he decided that he did not want to tour any longer, so he took two breaks. His first break was as an infantry soldier, rifleman, stretcher bearer, and ambulance driver in the 5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Australia's regular army from 1982 to 1985. He played the bagpipes in parades and on training missions, but ended his military service in July 1985 and suffered from a bad back as a result of his training. He also went backpacking in the U.K., listening to roots music, to children's music by artists like Raffi, and to recordings of children's books. When the Cockroaches disbanded in the early 1990s, Field enrolled at Macquarie University. While at university, he decided to record an album of children's music, enlisting the assistance of fellow student and guitarist Murray Cook, former Cockroaches roadie and vocalist Greg Page, former bandmate and keyboardist Jeff Fatt, and Macquarie instructor and composer Phillip Wilcher, who later left the group. The Wiggles The Wiggles recorded their first CD in 1991; it sold 100,000 copies. Field worked as a preschool teacher for two years before the success of the Wiggles and their extensive touring schedule, which he strongly disliked, forced him to quit. After the production of their second album, the Wiggles adopted colour- coded shirts to wear on stage. According to Field, he wore blue because Cook and Fatt already owned shirts in their colours of red and purple respectively, so he and Page \\"met in a Sydney department store and literally raced to see who got the blue shirt\\". Page ended up wearing a yellow shirt and Field originally wore a green polo shirt, but changed to blue to avoid clashing with Dorothy the Dinosaur. Anthony Field in 2012 Each Wiggle developed a \\"schtick\\" based on their actual behaviours, which evolved into caricatures, and served the same purpose as the uniforms in differentiating their characters and making them memorable to young children; Field's was eating. Field created and played the original Captain Feathersword; the role was taken over by Paul Paddick in 1996. Field also played Wags the Dog. Field (blue shirt) with the original line-up of the Wiggles, during a trip to NASA in 2004. By the mid-1990s, despite the success of the Wiggles, Field reported being suicidal and \\"frequently gripped by anxiety, sadness, and negativity\\". By mid-2004, shortly after his marriage and the birth of his first child, Field's serious medical issues, worsened by their heavy tour schedule, caused him to consider quitting or re-inventing the Wiggles, despite their great success in the U.K. and North America. After meeting chiropractor James Stoxen in Chicago in 2004, Field improved his health to the point that he was able to continue. He began to hire teams of chiropractors for himself, his fellow bandmembers, and castmembers in every city they performed, which he credited with making it possible for them to fulfill their touring requirements. In early 2013, Field became the only original member of the group to remain after Fatt, Cook, and Page retired. He remained in the group because he wanted to continue to educate children and as Wiggles manager Paul Field stated, \\"to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\". Field's musical influences include Lightning Hopkins, Elvis Presley, and the Rolling Stones. He plays several instruments, including the tin whistle, bagpipes, guitar, drums, trumpet, violin, percussion instruments and didgeridoo, and has been known to sing in a deep rich bass voice. Field, with input from the other members, produced most of the Wiggles' music, DVDs, and live shows. Personal life In 1999, Field was named \\"Bachelor of the Year\\" in Cleo Magazine. In 2003, he married Michaela Patisteas, a former dancer whose family owned Griffiths Coffee in Melbourne. They have three children, who have joined the Field family business by appearing in several of the Wiggles' TV shows and videos. Beginning in 2007, Field, who is a registered breeder of Miniature Fox Terriers, did some voiceover work for the TV show \\"RSPCA Animal Rescue,\\" for Channel 7 in Australia. Field on stage in 2007 Field, in describing his enthusiasm for competitive sports, has stated, \\"My love of cricket is abiding\\", a sport that \\"instills the same loyalty and passions in me as I know baseball does for many in North America\\". He is a fan of the Australian rugby league club the Wests Tigers. He is also a fan of singer Julio Iglesias. As Field's fitness improved, to the point that his training regimen became comparable to that of an elite athlete, he gained an interest in gymnastics and acrobatics. Field went public about his experience with clinical depression in mid-2007 to draw more attention to the condition. He has stated that \\"being on the road is a dangerous job for someone with depression,\\" but has dealt with it through diet, exercise, talking about it, and having a good support system (including his father before his death in 1998, his wife, and his friend Murray Cook, among his bandmates). He chronicled his health struggles and how he overcame them in his 2012 book How I Got My Wiggle Back.Field credited two doctors, chiropractors James Stoxen from Chicago and Richard Gringeri from Santa Clara, California, with the improvement in his health . Field is a devout Catholic, something that he reported helped him deal with his chronic health issues and depression, especially the spiritual practices of prayer and devotion to the Virgin Mary as expressed by Our Lady of Guadalupe. He has two large tattoos on his arms: one is the Virgin Mary with the words \\"My life is in your hands\\" in Spanish; the other is a heart with the words, \\"My love, my heart\\" in Spanish. The names of his wife and his three children are also tattooed on his arms. He admits that he got his tattoo of the Virgin, which he hid from fans for a long time, during a visit to Mexico while on tour in North America, in the middle of a bout with chronic pain and dental problems, as he put it, \\"in a moment of madness\\". Field was made a Member of the Order of Australia on 26 January 2010 \\"for service to the arts, particularly children's entertainment, and to the community as a benefactor and supporter of a range of charities\\". In 2018, Field, along with fellow Wiggles member Lachlan Gillespie and band members Oliver Brian and David O'Reilly, started a band for adult fans called the Unusual Commoners, which played a mixture of traditional Australian, Irish, Scottish and folk songs. They performed their first international show in St. John‚Äôs, Newfoundland in late 2018. In July 2020, he and the other classic Wiggles appeared in the Soul Movers music video for \\"Circles Baby\\".https://au.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-soul-movers-live- original-wiggles-lineup-13187/ Works cited * References External links * Category:1963 births Category:APRA Award winners Category:Living people Category:The Wiggles members Category:Australian musicians Category:Macquarie University alumni Category:Members of the Order of Australia Category:Australian Roman Catholics Category:Australian people of Italian descent Category:Musicians from Sydney Category:People educated at St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill Category:Australian drummers Category:Male drummers Category:Australian male singers Category:Australian children's musicians Category:Australian bass guitarists Category:Australian trumpeters Category:Australian violinists Category:Male violinists Category:Australian keyboardists Category:Australian multi-instrumentalists Category:Australian rock guitarists Category:Lead guitarists Category:Tin whistle players Category:Bagpipe players Category:Banjoists Category:Male bass guitarists Category:21st-century violinists Category:Australian male guitarists ","title":"Anthony Field"},{"id":"641159","text":"Graham Vivian Sutherland (24 August 1903 ‚Äì 17 February 1980) was an English artist who is notable for his work in glass, fabrics, prints and portraits. His work was much inspired by landscape and religion, and he designed the tapestry for the re-built Coventry Cathedral. Printmaking, mostly of romantic landscapes, dominated Sutherland's work during the 1920s. He developed his art by working in watercolours before switching to using oil paints in the 1940s. It is these oil paintings, often of surreal, organic landscapes of the Pembrokeshire coast, that secured his reputation as a leading British modern artist. Sutherland taught at a number of art colleges, notably at Chelsea School of Art and at Goldsmiths College, where he had been a student. He served as an official war artist in the Second World War drawing industrial scenes on the British home front. Such was Sutherland's standing in post-war Britain that he was commissioned to design the massive central tapestry in the new Coventry Cathedral, Christ in Glory in the Tetramorph. A number of portrait commissions in the 1950s proved highly controversial. Winston Churchill hated Sutherland's depiction of him. After initially refusing to be presented with it at all, he accepted it disparagingly as ‚Äúa remarkable example of modern art\\". Churchill's wife, Lady Spencer-Churchill, had the painting destroyed within a year of receiving it. In 1955, Sutherland and his wife purchased a property near Nice. Living abroad led to something of a decline in his status in Britain. However, a visit to Pembrokeshire in 1967, his first trip there in nearly twenty years, led to a creative renewal that went some way toward restoring his reputation as a leading British artist. Early life Slag-ladles (1943) (Art.IWM ART LD 1773) Graham Sutherland was born in Streatham in London, the son of a lawyer who later became a civil servant in the Land Registry Office and the Board of Education. Graham Sutherland attended Homefield Preparatory School in Sutton and was then educated at Epsom College, Surrey until 1919. Upon leaving school, after some preliminary coaching in art, Sutherland began an engineering apprenticeship at the Midland Railway locomotive works in Derby as several members of the extended Sutherland family had previously worked there. After a year he succeeded in persuading his father that he was not destined for a career in engineering and that he should be allowed to study art. There being no vacancies at his first choice, the Slade School of Fine Art, he entered Goldsmiths' School of Art in 1921, specialising in engraving and etching before graduating in 1926. In both 1925 and 1928, Sutherland exhibited drawings and engravings at the XXI Gallery in London. While still a student Sutherland established a reputation as a fine printmaker and commercial printmaking was to be his main source of income throughout the late 1920s. Sutherland's early prints of pastoral subjects show the influence of Samuel Palmer, largely mediated by the older etcher, F.L. Griggs. He did not begin to paint in earnest until he was in his 30s, following the collapse of the print market in 1930 due to the Great Depression. These pieces are mainly landscapes, which show an affinity with the work of Paul Nash. Sutherland focused on the inherent strangeness of natural forms, abstracting them to sometimes give his work a surrealist appearance; in 1936 he exhibited in the International Surrealist Exhibition in London. Sutherland converted to Catholicism in December 1926, the year before his marriage to Kathleen Barry (1905-1991), who had been a fellow student at Goldsmith's College. The couple, who were inseparable, lived at various locations in Kent before eventually buying a property in Trottiscliffe in 1945. Sutherland also took up glass design, fabric design, and poster design during the 1930s, and taught engraving at the Chelsea School of Art from 1926. Between 1935 and 1940, he also taught composition and book illustration at Chelsea. In 1934 he visited Pembrokeshire for the first time and was profoundly inspired by its landscape, and the region remained a source for his paintings for much of the following decade. Sutherland visited the area every year, until the start of the Second World War. Oil paintings of the Welsh landscape dominated his first one-man exhibition of paintings held in September 1938 at the Rosenberg and Helft Gallery in London. World War Two At the start of World War Two, the Chelsea School of Art closed for the duration of the conflict and Sutherland moved to rural Gloucestershire. Between 1940 and 1945, Sutherland was employed as a full-time, salaried artist by the War Artists' Advisory Committee. He recorded bomb damage in rural and urban Wales towards the end of 1940, then bomb damage caused by the Blitz in the City and East End of London. Almost all of Sutherland's paintings of bomb damage from the Blitz, either in Wales or in London, are titled Devastation:... and as such form a single body of work reflecting the needs of war-time propaganda, with precise locations not being disclosed and human remains not shown. A number of features reoccur within this body of work, for example, the fallen lift shafts that were often the most recognizable aspect of larger bombed buildings and a double row of bombed houses Sutherland saw in the Silvertown area of the East End. Sutherland returned to Wales in September 1941 to work on a series of paintings of blast furnaces. From June 1942, Sutherland painted further industrial scenes, first at tin mines in Cornwall then at a limestone quarry in Derbyshire and then at open-cast and underground coal mines in the Swansea area of South Wales. Sutherland spent four months from the end of March 1944 at the Royal Ordnance Factory at Woolwich Arsenal working on a series of five paintings for WAAC. In December 1944 he was sent to depict the damage inflicted by the RAF on the railway yards at Trappes and on the flying bomb sites at Saint-Leu-d'Esserent in France. In all Sutherland completed some 150 paintings as part of his WAAC commission. Post-war career The large tapestry Christ in Glory in the Tetramorph in Coventry Cathedral, England, designed by Graham Sutherland, installed in 1962 In 1944, he was commissioned by Walter Hussey (the Vicar of St Matthew's Church, Northampton and an important patron of modern religious art) to paint The Crucifixion (1946). This was Sutherland's first major religious painting and his first large figure study. In 1946, Sutherland had his first exhibition in New York. The same year he also taught painting at Goldsmiths' School of Art. From 1947 into the 1960s, his work was inspired by the landscape of the French Riviera, and he spent several months there each year. Eventually, in 1955, he purchased the villa Tempe √† Pailla designed by the Irish architect Eileen Gray at Menton. Beginning in 1949, Sutherland painted a number of portraits, with those of Somerset Maugham and Lord Beaverbrook among the most famous. Beaverbrook regarded his portrait by Sutherland, which clearly depicted him as cunning and reptilian, as both an 'outrage' and a 'masterpiece'. Sutherland's Portrait of Winston Churchill (1954) greatly upset the sitter, who initially refused to accept its presentation. It was subsequently destroyed on the orders of Churchill's wife, Clementine. However, some of Sutherland's studies for the portrait have survived. In all, Sutherland painted over fifty portraits, often of European aristocrats or senior businessmen. Following the Churchill portrait, Sutherland's portraits of, among others, Konrad Adenauer and the Queen Mother established him as something of an unofficial state portrait painter. This status was underlined by the award of the Order of Merit in 1960. In 1951, Sutherland was commissioned to produce a large work for the Festival of Britain. He exhibited in the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1952 along with Edward Wadsworth and the New Aspects of British Sculpture Group. From 1948 until 1954, Sutherland served as a trustee of the Tate gallery. In early 1954, Sutherland was commissioned to design the tapestry for Basil Spence's new Coventry Cathedral. Christ in Glory in the Tetramorph took three years to complete and was installed in 1962. To complete the work, Sutherland visited the weavers, of Felletin in France, on nine occasions.Roger Berthoud, ‚ÄòSutherland, Graham Vivian (1903‚Äì1980)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 Although Sutherland had converted to Catholicism in 1926, and from 1950 until he died was deeply involved in religion, he never stopped creating work based on nature and natural forms. Sometimes he was able to combine religious symbolism with nature, such as with putting thorns into his religious artwork. Sometimes forms which are often considered threatening in appearance are completely invented and have an organic appearance, as in his work Head III (1953). Later life Devastation, 1940, A House on the Welsh Border (Tate) From his portrait work, Sutherland acquired several patrons in Italy and took to spending the summer in Venice. However, in 1967, for an Italian television documentary, Sutherland visited Pembrokeshire for the first time in over twenty years and became inspired by the landscape to regularly work in the region until his death. Much of his work from this point until the end of his life incorporates motifs taken from the area, such as the estuaries at Sandy Haven and Picton. His work from this period includes two suites of prints The Bees (1976‚Äì77) and Apollinaire (1978‚Äì79). There were major retrospective shows at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1951, the Tate in 1982, the Mus√©e Picasso, Antibes, France in 1998 and the Dulwich Picture Gallery in 2005. A major exhibition of rarely seen works on paper by Sutherland, curated by artist George Shaw, was shown in Oxford, in 2011‚Äì12. Sutherland died in 1980 and was buried in the graveyard of the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Trottiscliffe, Kent. Legacy The main building of Coventry School of Art and Design, part of Coventry University, is named after Sutherland. A radio play, Portrait of Winston, by Jonathan Smith, is a dramatisation of his portrait of Winston Churchill. The same incident features in the Netflix series, The Crown, and was discussed by Simon Schama in his 2015 BBC television series The Face of Britain by Simon Schama. Works by Sutherland are held in the collections of Amgueddfa Cymru ‚Äì National Museum Wales, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery, Kirklees Museums and Art Gallery, Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Manchester Art Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery, Northampton Museums and Art Gallery, Pallant House Gallery, Southampton City Art Gallery, The Ingram Collection of Modern British and Contemporary Art, Tenby Museum and Art Gallery, The Fitzwilliam Museum and The Priseman Seabrook Collection.

As part of the lymphatic system, lymph vessels are complementary to the cardiovascular system. Lymph vessels are lined by endothelial cells, and have a thin layer of smooth muscle, and adventitia that binds the lymph vessels to the surrounding tissue. Lymph vessels are devoted to the propulsion of the lymph from the lymph capillaries, which are mainly concerned with absorption of interstitial fluid from the tissues. Lymph capillaries are slightly larger than their counterpart capillaries of the vascular system. Lymph vessels that carry lymph to a lymph node are called afferent lymph vessels, and those that carry it from a lymph node are called efferent lymph vessels, from where the lymph may travel to another lymph node, may be returned to a vein, or may travel to a larger lymph duct. Lymph ducts drain the lymph into one of the subclavian veins and thus return it to general circulation. Generally, lymph flows away from the tissues to lymph nodes and eventually to either the right lymphatic duct or the largest lymph vessel in the body, the thoracic duct. These vessels drain into the right and left subclavian veins, respectively. The lymphatic vessels contain valves. Structure The general structure of lymphatics is based on that of blood vessels. There is an inner lining of single flattened epithelial cells (simple squamous epithelium) composed of a type of epithelium that is called endothelium, and the cells are called endothelial cells. This layer functions to mechanically transport fluid and since the basement membrane on which it rests is discontinuous; it leaks easily. The next layer is that of smooth muscles that are arranged in a circular fashion around the endothelium, which by shortening (contracting) or relaxing alter the diameter (caliber) of the lumen. The outermost layer is the adventitia that consists of fibrous tissue. The general structure described here is seen only in larger lymphatics; smaller lymphatics have fewer layers. The smallest vessels (lymphatic or lymph capillaries) lack both the muscular layer and the outer adventitia. As they proceed forward and in their course are joined by other capillaries, they grow larger and first take on an adventitia, and then smooth muscles. The lymphatic conducting system broadly consists of two types of channels--the initial lymphatics, the prelymphatics or lymph capillaries that specialize in collection of the lymph from the ISF, and the larger lymph vessels that propel the lymph forward. Unlike the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system is not closed and has no central pump. Lymph movement occurs despite low pressure due to peristalsis (propulsion of the lymph due to alternate contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle), valves, and compression during contraction of adjacent skeletal muscle and arterial pulsation. Propulsion of lymph through lymph vessel  Lymph capillaries  The lymphatic circulation begins with blind ending (closed at one end) highly permeable superficial lymph capillaries, formed by endothelial cells with button-like junctions between them that allow fluid to pass through them when the interstitial pressure is sufficiently high. These button-like junctions consist of protein filaments like platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, or PECAM-1. A valve system in place here prevents the absorbed lymph from leaking back into the ISF. There is another system of semilunar (semi=half; lunar=related to the Moon) valves that prevents back-flow of lymph along the lumen of the vessel. Lymph capillaries have many interconnections (anastomoses) between them and form a very fine network. Rhythmic contraction of the vessel walls through movements may also help draw fluid into the smallest lymphatic vessels, capillaries. If tissue fluid builds up the tissue will swell; this is called edema. As the circular path through the body's system continues, the fluid is then transported to progressively larger lymphatic vessels culminating in the right lymphatic duct (for lymph from the right upper body) and the thoracic duct (for the rest of the body); both ducts drain into the circulatory system at the right and left subclavian veins. The system collaborates with white blood cells in lymph nodes to protect the body from being infected by cancer cells, fungi, viruses or bacteria. This is known as a secondary circulatory system. Lymph vessels The lymph capillaries drain the lymph to larger contractile lymphatics, which have valves as well as smooth muscle walls. These are called the collecting lymphatics. As the collecting lymph vessel accumulates lymph from more and more lymph capillaries in its course, it becomes larger and is called the afferent lymph vessel as it enters a lymphs node. Here the lymph percolates through the lymph node tissue and is removed by the efferent lymph vessel. An efferent lymph vessel may directly drain into one of the (right or thoracic) lymph ducts, or may empty into another lymph node as its afferent lymph vessel. Both the lymph ducts return the lymph to the blood stream by emptying into the subclavian veins The functional unit of a lymph vessel is known as a lymphangion, which is the segment between two semilunar valves. Since it is contractile, depending upon the ratio of its length to its radius, it can act either like a contractile chamber propelling the fluid ahead, or as a resistance vessel tending to stop the lymph in its place. Function Lymph vessels act as reservoirs for plasma and other substances including cells that have leaked from the vascular system and transport lymph fluid back from the tissues to the circulatory system. Without functioning lymph vessels, lymph cannot be effectively drained and lymphedema typically results. Afferent vessels The afferent lymph vessels enter at all parts of the periphery of the lymph node, and after branching and forming a dense plexus in the substance of the capsule, open into the lymph sinuses of the cortical part. It carries unfiltered lymph into the node. In doing this they lose all their coats except their endothelial lining, which is continuous with a layer of similar cells lining the lymph paths. Afferent lymphatic vessels are only found in lymph nodes. This is in contrast to efferent lymphatic vessel which are also found in the thymus and spleen. Efferent vessels The efferent lymphatic vessel commences from the lymph sinuses of the medullary portion of the lymph nodes and leave the lymph nodes at the hilum, either to veins or greater nodes. It carries filtered lymph out of the node. Efferent lymphatic vessels are also found in the thymus and spleen. This is in contrast to afferent lymphatic vessels, which are found only in lymph nodes. Clinical significance Lymphedema is the swelling of tissues due to insufficient fluid drainage by the lymphatic vessels. It can be the result from absent, underdeveloped or dysfunctional lymphatic vessels. In hereditary (or primary) lymphedema, the lymphatic vessels are absent, underdeveloped or dysfunctional due to genetic causes. In acquired (or secondary) lymphedema, the lymphatic vessels are damaged by injury or infection. Lymphangiomatosis is a disease involving multiple cysts or lesions formed from lymphatic vessels.

The attack took place near the Kissufim Crossing near their home in Gush Katif bloc of Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip during the Second Intifada. After shooting at the vehicle in which Hatuel was driving with her daughters, witnesses said the militants approached the vehicle and shot the occupants repeatedly at close range. An alliance of Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was carried out in reprisal for the assassinations of Hamas leaders Sheikh Ahmad Yassin and Abdelaziz Rantisi by the Israeli army some weeks earlier. The attack shocked the Israeli public, and was classified by Amnesty International as a crime against humanity. On June 6, 2007, the IDF arrested Jihad Salah Saliman Abu Dahar, a Palestinian member of Islamic Jihad from the Khan Yunis area, who according to Shin Bet officials admitted to several acts of violence, including the attack on Hatuel and her daughters.  Background  In 1992 David and Tali Hatuel, a Jewish Israeli couple, moved from Ofakim, in southern Israel, to the Israeli settlement Katif located in the Gush Katif bloc in the Gaza Strip. David Hatuel was familiar with Gush Katif having studied in a yeshiva there. After 3 years the couple left for 18 months but returned once they had completed their studies. Tali worked as a social worker with the Gaza Coast Regional Council. Her work included counseling Israelis whose relatives had been killed in the conflict. David worked as a school principal in Ashkelon. They had four daughters and Tali was eight months pregnant with a son when she was killed. The attack On Sunday, May 2, 2004, Hatuel picked up her three oldest daughters from school and drove with them and their 2-year-old sister in the family station wagon towards her husband's workplace in Ashkelon to campaign against Israel's unilateral disengagement plan. Likud party members were voting that day in a legally non-binding, advisory referendum being conducted across Israel and in Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories on Ariel Sharon's disengagement proposal. While traveling in the vicinity of the Kissufim Crossing at 12:40 pm, two armed Palestinian militants, who had prepared an ambush near the highway, opened fire at the car, causing the car to spin off the road. The attackers, who were armed with automatic rifles, then approached the vehicle and fired their weapons from close range at Hatuel and her daughters repeatedly. The gunmen also opened fire on an Israeli civilian from Ohad in southern Israel traveling in a separate car. He managed to reverse and drive away injured. A CNN film crew working near Gush Katif who had come under fire by the militants earlier had attempted to warn and stop Israeli civilian vehicles leaving Gush Katif, among them Hatuel and her four daughters who drove past the armored CNN car. Twenty minutes before the attack, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had received information about a possible attack and were strengthening forces in the area. The IDF killed both of the gunmen, identified as Ibrahim Mohammad Hammad (22), and Faisal Abu Naqira (26), reportedly from the Rafah refugee camp. A sniper stationed close by killed one of the men and soldiers sent to the scene charged the other attacker and shot him. Two soldiers from the Givati Brigade who were in a vehicle behind the Hatuel car were also injured during the battle. An explosive device was set off near the attack site but it did not result in any injuries. The Popular Resistance Committees and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was carried out in reprisals for the assassinations of Hamas leaders Sheikh Ahmad Yassin and Abdelaziz Rantisi by the Israeli army earlier the same year and reportedly described it as \\"heroic\\".  Victims  { * Tali Hatuel, 34 (eight months pregnant) * Hila Hatuel, 11 * Hadar Hatuel, 9  * Roni Hatuel, 7 * Merav Hatuel, 2 } Aftermath Tali Hatuel and her children were the first settlers in Gaza to be killed since 2002 and the attack \\"provoked extreme tension in Gaza\\". The deaths brought the total number of people killed in the Second Intifada to 3,958 at that time, 905 Israelis and 2,983 Palestinians. Following the attack, Israeli helicopters fired three missiles at a tower- block in the Rimal neighbourhood of Gaza City that housed a radio station with links to Hamas which the IDF alleged had been broadcasting \\"incitement\\". The attack on the building, which also contained apartments, businesses, and the two main Palestinian newspapers, al-Ayyam and al-Quds, collapsed part of the roof, cut off the building's electricity and wounded seven people. Hours later, an Israeli air strike on a car in the West Bank city of Nablus killed four people described as members of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades by Palestinian sources. The IDF described them as \\"senior terrorists\\" who had been responsible for several attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers. On May 9, 2004, a week after the attack, two gunmen reportedly dressed in women's clothing, opened fire on about 200 to 300 people attending a heavily guarded memorial service on the Kissufim road in the southern Gaza Strip for Tali Hatuel and her daughters. Mourners had to take cover behind vehicles during the 20 to 30 minute exchange of fire. The gunmen opened fire on the attendees from about 300 meters away. David Hatuel was not present having been stopped on the way by soldiers once the shooting started. No Israelis were injured in the attack. The body of one gunman killed by the Israel Defense Forces was recovered after a search of the area but the IDF said that they believed a second gunman was also killed. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack. After the attack, the chairman of the Gaza Coast Regional Council said \\"The IDF needs to open a corridor of one kilometer on either side of the road\\". Settlers in the area had complained that the IDF had not demolished Palestinian homes next to the Kissufim road where the attack took place. The following day, on May 10, 2004, IDF troops shot dead a 22-year-old local Palestinian when Israeli bulldozers razed a row of homes and a four- storey block of flats was demolished in the Khan Yunis refugee camp a few hundred meters from where the attack took place. Palestinian sources, international aid organizations and media sources variously reported that 75 Palestinians or 50 families were left homeless by the action. By May 10, according to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, 1,100 Palestinians had been made homeless by Israeli military raids in Gaza in what they described as \\"one of the most intense periods of destruction for years\\" and \\"illegal collective punishment\\" for the killing of Tali Hatuel and children. The IDF described the figures as \\"highly exaggerated\\" and said they only demolished buildings that they had confirmed had been used by militants to attack Israeli targets. Near the end of May, during Operation Rainbow, the Israeli army demolished a building across the street from the home of Ibrahim Hammad, one of the perpetrators of the attack on the Hatuel family. According to a neighbor, residents had already left the area on the assumption that Hammad's house would be demolished. According to Human Rights Watch, Hammad's house was not harmed but a house across the street belonging to Mahmoud Abu Arab was bulldozed instead. Abu Arab submitted a claim for compensation from the Israeli authorities. On September 25, 2005, the Israeli Air Force killed the organizer of the attack, Sheikh Khalil, in a targeted assassination, described by Islamic Jihad as one of its \\"most senior commanders in Palestine.\\" Khalil, who had survived several previous assassination attempts, died when an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a missile at his car in the Gaza Strip. His deputy was also killed and four others were injured. Israel military officials stated that Khalil had orchestrated several attacks on Israelis. On June 6, 2007, the IDF arrested Jihad Salah Saliman Abu Dahar, a member of Islamic Jihad from the Khan Yunis area, who according to Shin Bet officials admitted to involvement in violence, including the Hatuel murder. Abu Dahar reportedly admitted to carrying out surveillance of the attack site and IDF patrols in the weeks prior to the murders and on May 2, 2004, he notified his commanders when IDF patrols were absent. Reactions Ariel Sharon, Prime Minister of Israel at the time, condemned the attack as a \\"brutal crime against civilians and children.\\" In Damascus, Ramadan Shallah, the leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad said killing of Israeli women and children was permissible \\"because they decided spontaneously to go live in a war zone\\". The attack was strongly condemned by Amnesty International as a deliberate attack against civilians and therefore a crime against humanity as defined by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The commissioner general of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) condemned the killings of Tali Hatuel and her children but accused the Israel authorities of carrying out reprisal demolitions of Palestinian homes in some areas as a form of collective punishment forbidden by international law. Commemoration The funeral, held in Ashkelon the same day as the attack, was attended by thousands of mourners including Moshe Katsav, the President of Israel at the time. On June 16, 2004, Ben-Gurion University in the Negev awarded Tali Hatuel a posthumous Masters of Arts degree in Social Work, and granted her husband a Masters of Arts in Jewish Philosophy. On July 25, 2004, Hatuel's husband David was given a place of prominence near the Western Wall in the human chain from the Gaza Strip to Jerusalem protesting against Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in which over 130,000 Israelis took part. On August 22, 2005, the day Katif was evacuated, David Hatuel addressed the settlers, defining the day as one of destruction and expulsion, thanking his fellow residents for their support after the murder of his wife and children, adding: \\"We are going through a crisis, an unfathomable hardship; but we will not despair and we will not fall.\\" In December of the same year, he married Limor Shem-Tov, an occupational therapist, stating: \\"I have two options, either to collapse or to continue living. I have chosen life! My new home is an addition and not a replacement of the home that was destroyed. I am like a tree whose branches were cut off and now they are growing again.\\" He and Shem-Tov had three sons and a daughter.http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/152277#.URGv96Xs6zo References Category:Mass murder in 2004 Category:Deaths by firearm in the Gaza Strip Category:Israeli casualties in the Al-Aqsa Intifada Category:Israeli murder victims Category:Israeli settlers Category:Terrorism deaths in the Gaza Strip Category:Palestinian terrorism Category:Murdered Israeli children Category:Terrorist attacks attributed to Palestinian militant groups Category:Israeli terrorism victims ","title":"Murder of Hatuel family"},{"id":"641194","text":"Engraved 1916 letterhead of the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel with vignettes of the hotel as well as those of the Waldorf and Astoria Hotels in New York all of which were then operating under the management of George Boldt. Boldt also owned the Waldorf Astoria Segar Company George Charles Boldt Sr. (April 25, 1851 ‚Äì December 5, 1916) was a Prussian-born American hotelier. A self-made millionaire, he influenced the development of the urban hotel as a civic social center and luxury destination. Life and career He was born as Georg Karl Boldt in Bergen auf R√ºgen, Prussia, on April 25, 1851. He immigrated to the United States in 1864. He began as a kitchen worker in New York and, at age 25, was hired (by his future father-in-law) to manage the dining room of Philadelphia's most exclusive gentlemen's club, The Philadelphia Club. Boldt's first hotel was the Bellevue (1881), at the northwest corner of Broad & Walnut Streets, in Philadelphia. He soon bought a competing hotel, the Stratford, at the southwest corner. Two decades later, on the site of the Stratford, he built the largest hotel the city had ever seen, the 1,090-room Bellevue- Stratford Hotel (1902‚Äì04, now the Hyatt). The enormous fortunes generated by robber barons in the post-Civil War Era led to an unprecedented level of luxurious living for wealthy Americans. Boldt catered to this new super-rich class, charging the highest prices for the very best, and becoming one of them in the process. William Waldorf Astor built the Waldorf Hotel (1890‚Äì93) in New York City, with Boldt as proprietor. John Jacob Astor IV built the adjoining Astoria Hotel (1897). Boldt mediated between the feuding millionaire cousins, leasing the Astoria himself, and merging the two buildings under his management as the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The Empire State Building now occupies its site at 34th Street and 5th Avenue. He is credited with popularizing Thousand Island dressing at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where he instructed the ma√Ætre d', Oscar Tschirky, to include it on the menu. The hotel introduced other popular food items, such as Waldorf Salad. Boldt also owned the Waldorf Astoria Segar Company, which imported fine Cuban cigars and was located at the hotel. He built Boldt Castle on an island in the Thousand Islands area of New York State. The enormous castle was intended as a gift for his wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt, but when she died suddenly on January 7, 1904 in Manhattan, at the age of 43, construction was halted. The castle, near Alexandria Bay, was restored after decades of vandalism and is now a major summer tourist attraction. Towards the end of his life, he commissioned architect Francis T. Underhill to build him a Swiss-chalet-style mansion, \\"La Manzanita,\\" in Montecito, Santa Barbara, California. Boldt died on December 5, 1916, in Manhattan, New York City of a heart attack. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, New York. Legacy Boldt once owned Nikola Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower property, receiving it as payment for a debt. Tesla mortgaged the property to Boldt and the Waldorf-Astoria to pay the costs of his residence at the hotel when he encountered financial difficulties. Tesla did so first in 1904 and again in 1908; he was unable to repay the mortgages. Boldt and the Waldorf-Astoria foreclosed on the property in 1915. He was a trustee of Cornell University. In 1923, Boldt's daughter, Mrs. Alfred G. Miles, donated US$50,000 to the university for the construction of Boldt Tower to honor her father's memory.(subscription only) Boldt Hall is also named for him. Three bricks from the original structure of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel were incorporated into the building. Saying that his father always sympathized with an eager student whose only impediment to higher education was a lack of funds, Boldt's son George C. Boldt Jr. established a scholarship program at Cornell bearing his father's name in 1922.(PDF) During his lifetime, Boldt was a frequent donor to Cornell University, the American Red Cross, many local hospitals and built a library at Alexandria Bay, New York. Boldt also helped put at least 75 young men through college, doing this anonymously. He also assisted those in business who were having financial difficulties and told employees at his hotels if they were having monetary problems, his door was always open to them. Boldt's will equally divided US$15 million between his son and daughter, with a request to his children that they continue to financially support the charities he had donated to in the past. While the will gave his children the right to dispose of any or all of Boldt's properties, they made no plans to sell any of their father's holdings, with George Charles Boldt Jr. assuming the presidency of the company his father began. Family From his marriage to Louise Augusta Kehrer, he had two children: George Charles Boldt Jr. and Clover Louise Boldt, later Mrs. Alfred Graham Miles, and three granddaughters.

Early life and education Marie-Louise Ida Margareta von Franz was born in Munich, Germany, the daughter of a colonel in the Austrian army. After World War I, in 1919, her family moved to Switzerland, near St. Gallen. From 1928 on, she lived in Zurich, together with her elder sister, so that both could attend a high school (gymnasium) in Zurich, specializing in languages and literature. Three years later, her parents moved to Zurich as well. Meeting Carl Gustav Jung In Zurich, at the age of 18, in 1933, when about to finish secondary school, von Franz met the psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung when, together with a classmate and nephew of Jung's assistant Toni Wolff, she and seven boys she had befriended were invited by Jung to his Bollingen Tower near Zurich. For von Franz, this was a powerful and \\"decisive encounter of her life\\", as she told her sister later the same evening. At the meeting, Jung and the pupils discussed psychology. When Jung commented on a \\"mentally ill woman, who [actually, not to be taken symbolically] lived on the moon\\" M.-L. von Franz understood, that there are two levels of reality. The psychological, inner world with its dreams and myths was as real as the outer world. Anne Maguire: \\"Marie-Louise von Franz. Doyenne\\", In James A. Hall and Daryl Sharp: Marie-Louise von Franz. The Classic Jungian and The Classic Jungian Tradition. Inner City Books, Toronto 2008, p. 36, . Studies, meagre times and private lessons In 1933, at the University of Zurich, von Franz started studies in Classical philology and Classical languages (Latin and Greek) as major subjects and in literature and ancient history as minor subjects. Due to her father's major financial loss in the early 1930s, she had to self-finance her tuition, by giving private lessons as a tutor in Latin and Greek for gymnasium and university students. In the years after finishing her studies, she continued this to support herself, working on fairy tale texts. In addition to her university studies, von Franz occupied herself with Jungian psychology. She attended Jung's psychological lectures at the Swiss Federal Polytechnical School in Zurich (now the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich) and, in 1935 and thereafter, also attended his psychological seminars. In 1934 she started analytical training with Jung. Collaboration with C.G. Jung In order to pay C.G. Jung for her training analysis, she translated works for him from Greek and Latin texts. Among others, she translated two major alchemical manuscripts: Aurora Consurgens, which has been attributed to Thomas Aquinas, and Musaeum Hermeticum. As many of its passages were of Islamic and Persian origin, M.-L. von Franz took up Arabic as study subject at university. This was the beginning of a long-standing collaboration with C.G. Jung, which continued until his death in 1961. Their collaboration was especially close in the field of alchemy. Not only did she translate works, she also commented on the origin and psychological meaning of Aurora Consurgens. She offered support for the theory that the Christian-alchemical text might have been dictated by Thomas Aquinas himself.See Introduction of Marie-Louise von Franz: Aurora Consurgens. A Document Attributed to Thomas Aquinas on the Problem of Opposites in Alchemy. A Companion Work to C.G. Jung's Mysterium Conjunctionis. Translated by R.F.C. Hull and A.S.B. Glover. (Studies in Jungian Psychology). Inner City Books, Toronto 2000, p. X-XI, 4, 429‚Äì430. IBN 0919123-90-2. The experience that Jung termed \\"objective Psyche\\" or \\"collective unconscious\\" marked her life and work as well as her way of living. She worked to understand the reality of this autonomous psyche acting independently from consciousness. Career Von Franz worked with Carl Jung, whom she met in 1933 and with whom she collaborated until his death in 1961.Isler says that Marie-Louise von Franz has probably been \\"the closest and most important collaborator of C.G. Jung in the last third of his life.\\" See his German foreword in \\"Jungiana A, Vol. 2\\" (1990), p. 7. This issue was dedicated to von Franz. From 1942 on until her death, Marie-Louise von Franz practised as an analyst, mainly in K√ºsnacht, Switzerland. In 1987, she claimed to have interpreted over 65,000 dreams.Boa, Frazer: The Way of the Dream. Windrose Films, Toronto 1988. . She wrote more than 20 books on analytical psychology, most notably on fairy tales as they relate to archetypal psychology and depth psychology. She amplified the themes and characters of these tales and focused on subjects such as the problem of evil, the changing of the attitude towards the archetype of the female.Marie-Louise von Franz. Shadow and Evil in Fairytales. Spring Publications, Zurich, New York 1974 and Shambhala, Boston 1995. Marie-Louise von Franz. Problems of the Feminine in Fairytales. Spring Publications Zurich, New York 1972 and Boston, Shambhala 1993. Another field of interest and writing was alchemy, which von Franz discussed from the Jungian psychological perspective. She edited, translated and commented on Aurora Consurgens, attributed to Thomas Aquinas, on the problem of opposites in alchemy. During her last years of life, she commented on the Arabic alchemical manuscript of Mu·∏•ammad Ibn Umail Hal ar-Rumuz (Solving the Symbols).Marie-Louise von Franz: Book of the Explanation of the Symbols. KitƒÅb ·∏§all ar-Rum≈´z by Mu·∏•ammad Ibn Umail. Psychological Commentary by Marie-Louise von Franz (= Corpus Alchemicum Arabicum. Vol. I A). Translated by Salwa Fuat and Theodor Abt, edited by Theodor Abt. Living Human Heritage Publications, Zurich 2006, . For alchemists, imaginatio vera was an important approach to matter. It resembles in many aspects the active imagination discovered by C. G. Jung. Marie-Louise von Franz lectured in 1969 about active imagination and alchemyMarie-Louise von Franz: Alchemical Active Imagination, Spring Publ., Texas 1979. and also wrote about it in Man and His Symbols. Active imagination may be described as conscious dreaming. In Man and His Symbols she wrote: A third field of interest and research was synchronicity, psyche and matter, and numbers. It seems to have been triggered by Jung, whose research had led him to the hypothesis about the unity of the psychic and material worlds‚Äîthat they are one and the same, just different manifestations. He also believed that this concept of the unus mundus could be investigated by means of researching archetypes. Due to his advanced age, he turned the problem over to von Franz.Marie-Louise von Franz Number and Time (Northwestern, 1974) ix. Two of her books, Number and Time and Psyche and Matter, deal with this research. In 1968, von Franz was the first to argue that the mathematical structure of DNA is analogous to that of the I Ching. She cited the I Ching in an essay, \\"Symbols of the Unus Mundus\\", published in her book Psyche and Matter.Marie- Louise von Franz Psyche and Matter (Shambhala, 1992) p. 39‚Äì62. The reference is cited on page 44; she cites the reference as number 16 of the article: Dialog √ºber den Menschen: Eine Festschrift zum 75. Geburtstag von Wilhelm Bitter (Klett. Stuttgart, 1968). Another basic concern throughout many of her works was how the collective unconscious compensates for the one-sidedness of Christianity and its ruling god image, via fairy tales and alchemy. In an analysis of the visions of Saint Perpetua, a martyr,Meria-Louise von Franz. The Passion of Perpetua. A psychological interpretation of Her Visions.. The Jungian Classical Series. Spring Publ. Dallas 1980. . Reprint: Inner City books, Toronto 2004. she writes that such visions enable us to gain a deep insight into the unconscious spiritual situation of the time. They show the deep conflict of that time, the transition from Paganism to Christianity. ‚ÄúThe martyrs appear in many respect as the tragic, unconscious victims of the transformation which was then being fulfilled deep down in the collective stratum of the human soul: the transformation of the image of God‚Äú Another compensatory motif is the symbolism of the vessel of the holy grail in The Grail legend.Marie-Louise von Franz, The Grail legend. With Emma Jung. Putnam's sons/C.G. Jung Foundation, New York 1970. In this book she discusses the psychological symbolism of the documented legends of the Holy Grail. It evolved out of the completion of Emma Jung's unfinished research, which Marie- Louise von Franz had been asked to take over and publish after Emma Jung's death. In the visions of Swiss Saint Nikolaus von Fl√ºe Not translated into English yet. she dealt with the aspects of the dark and evil as well as the cosmic side as part of a more holistic image of god. Von Franz says that the visions reveal basic tendencies of collective unconscious that seem to strive to further develop the Christian symbolism and by that giving points of orientation, showing where the unconscious psyche wants to let us notice and understand the problem of opposites and by that to bring us to more closeness and fear of God.Marie-Louise von Franz, Die Visionen des Niklaus von Fl√ºe. Daimon, 1980 (first edition), 1991 (fourth edition), p. 129f. . In addition to her many books, von Franz made a series of films in 1987 titled The Way of the Dream, along with her student, Fraser Boa. In The Wisdom of the Dream, a channel 4 television series, London 1989, von Franz was interviewed. Text of the film is printed in: Seegaller, S. and Berger, M: Jung ‚Äì the Wisdom of the Dream. London 1989. In 1941‚Äì1944 von Franz was an associate member of the Psychological Club, Zurich. There she first lectured on the visions of Perpetua on June 7, 1941, which later was expanded and published as her first book The Visions of Perpetua. In the following years, she held many lectures at the Zurich Psychological Club. They constituted the basis of many of her books. Between 1942 and 1952 she acted as its librarian.Emmanuel Kennedy- Xypolitas. Introduction, In Emmanuel Kennedy-Xypolitas (ed.), The Fountain of the Love of Wisdom. An homage to Marie-Louise von Franz, Chiron Publications Wilmette, Illinois 2006, p. xxxii, footnote 2. In 1944 she became one of its full members. In 1948, she was a co-founder of the C. G. Jung Institute in Zurich. In 1974, von Franz together with some of her pupils (Ren√© Malamud, Willi Obrist, Alfred Ribi, and Paul Walder) founded the \\"Stiftung f√ºr Jung'sche Psychologie\\" (Foundation for Jungian Psychology). The aim of this foundation is to support research and promulgation of the findings in the field of Jungian depth psychology. It also publishes the journal Jungiana. Jung encouraged von Franz to live with fellow Jungian analyst Barbara Hannah, who was 23 years older than she was. When Hannah asked Jung why he was so keen on putting them together, Jung replied that he wanted von Franz \\"to see that not all women are such brutes as her mother\\". Jung also stated that \\"the real reason you should live together is that your chief interest will be analysis, and analysts should not live alone.\\"Dean L. Franz's portrait of Barbara Hannah in Hannah's The Cat, Dog and Horse Lectures (Chiron, 1992), p. 18 The two women became lifelong friends. Interpretation of fairy tales In 1935 Hedwig von Beit asked Marie-Louise von Franz to assist her part-time with writing a book about fairy tales. Von Franz indulged into a time-consuming 9-years research and interpretation work. Fairy tales became increasingly important to her in regard to psychological questions. The work is published in the book \\"Symbolik des M√§rchens\\" (Symbolism of Fairy Tales).Not published in English. Nevertheless, this book (of 3 volumes) was only published under the name of Hedwig von Beit. In her later talks and books, she connects fairy tale interpretation with everyday life. Alfred Ribi says, that von Franz might well be understood as the first to discover and demonstrate the psychological wisdom of fairy tales. Von Franz's interpretation of fairy talesFor a comprehensive introduction into fairy tale interpretation, and main terms of Jungian Psychology (Anima, Animus, Shadow) see Marie-Louise von Franz. \\"An Introduction to the Psychology of Fairytales\\". Zurich, New York 1970. bases on Jung‚Äòs view of fairy tales as a spontaneous and naive product of soul, which can only express what soul is.C. G. Jung: The Phenomoneology of the Sprit in Fairytales (1948). In: Collected Works, Vol. 9,I, Princeton/Bollingen 1980, par. 432. That means, she looks at fairy tales as images of different phases of experiencing the reality of the soul. They are the ‚Äúpurest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes‚Äù and ‚Äúthey represent the archetypes in their simplest, barest and most concise form‚Äù because they are less overlaid with conscious material than myths and legends. ‚ÄúIn this pure form, the archetypal images afford us the best clues to the understanding of the processes going on in the collective psyche‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe fairy tale itself is its own best explanation; that is, its meaning is contained in the totality of its motifs connected by the thread of the story. [...] Every fairy tale is a relatively closed system compounding one essential psychological meaning which is expressed in a series of symbolical pictures and events and is discoverable in these‚Äù. ‚ÄúI have come to the conclusion that all fairy tales endeavour to describe one and the same psychic fact, but a fact so complex and far-reaching and so difficult for us to realize in all its different aspects that hundreds of tales and thousands of repetitions with a musician‚Äôs variation are needed until this unknown fact is delivered into consciousness; and even then the theme is not exhausted. This unknown fact is what Jung calls the Self, which is the psychic reality of the collective unconscious. [...] Every archetype is in its essence only one aspect of the collective unconscious as well as always representing also the whole collective unconscious. The fairy tales' hero and heroine ‚Äì with which the auditory identifies ‚Äì are taken as archetypal figures (not as common human ego) representing the archetypal foundation of the ego- complex of an individual or a group. ‚ÄúThe hero restores to healthy , normal functioning a situation in which all egos of that tribe or nation are deviating from their instinctive basic totality pattern. Hero and Heroine form ‚Äùa model of an ego [...] demonstrating a rightly functioning ego, [...] in accordance with the requirements of the Self‚Äù. G. Isler explains further, \\"The figure of the hero as well as the whole story compensate what initially was an insufficient or wrong attitude of consciousness. The initial situation of need, misery and shortcomings is solved at the end having a structure which is more whole than the beginning. This corresponds to a renewal of the ruling consciousness (expressed e.g. in the young king), being oriented towards psychic wholeness and totality in a way that is more appropriate\\" to the demands of the Self, than before. \\"Fairy tales compensate individual consciousness, but also an insufficient attitude of collective consciousness, which in European culture has been coined mainly by Christianity.\\" In contrast to personalistic-subjective ways of interpretation, the fate of the hero is not understood as individual neurosis, but as difficulties and dangers, being imposed on man by nature.Gotthilf Isler: Franz, Marie-Louise von. In: Enzyklop√§die des M√§rchens. Handw√∂rterbuch zur historischen und vergleichenden Erz√§hlforschung. Edited by Rolf Wilhelm Brednich and Hermann Bausinger. Vol. 5, De Gruyter, Berlin 1987, p. 100. Correspondence with Wolfgang Pauli Von Franz had a lengthy exchange of letters with Wolfgang Pauli, winner of a Nobel Prize in physics. On Pauli's death, his widow Franca deliberately destroyed all the letters von Franz had sent to her husband, and which he had kept locked inside his writing desk. But the letters sent by Pauli to von Franz were all saved and were later made available to researchers (and published as well). Bollingen tower Von Franz was passionately interested in nature and gardening. In order to meet her love for nature, she acquired a piece of land at the borders of a large forest above Bollingen. There, in 1958, she built a quadrate tower following the example of C. G. Jung. The tower was meant to be a hermitage, having neither electricity nor a flushing cistern. She used to take her wood for heating and cooking from the surrounding woods. Besides the house, there was a bog pond, abundant with toads and frogs, which she loved. This tower enabled her \\"to escape modern civilization and all its unrest from time to time and to find a refuge in nature\\", as her sister reported. At that place, she felt \\"in tune with the spirit of nature\\" and she wrote a good many of her books that she had planned early on in her life, and which she had realised one after the other, throughout the decades.Barbara Davies, Marie- Louise von Franz. Her Life and Work. In: James A. Hall and Daryl Sharp, Marie- Louise von Franz. The Classic Jungian and The Classic Jungian Tradition. (Inner City Books Toronto 2008) p. 54.  Last years  Between the 1950s and 1970s, von Franz travelled widely, not only for holidays but also for lecturing. She visited European countries including Austria, England, Germany, Greece, Italy and Scotland, as well as America, Egypt and some Asian countries. After 1986 she turned to a more introverted life at her home in K√ºsnacht, Switzerland. Several times a year she took a retreat into her Bollingen tower, which in some years was up to a five months stay. She concentrated mainly on her creative work, especially alchemy and continued to meet friends and patients from all over the world. During her last years, von Franz had Parkinson's disease. Barbara Davies stated that she took only a minimum of medicine, so that she was increasingly physically affected by her illness until death, but could keep a clear mind and consciousness.Barbara Davies, \\"Marie-Louise von Franz: Her Life and Work\\", in James A.

The party was created in March 1981 by five former members of the province's New Democratic Party: Sidney Green, Ben Hanuschak, Bud Boyce, Murdoch Mackay and Max Hofford. Green was acknowledged as the party's leader. Despite its name, this party had no connection with the original Progressive Party of Manitoba, which was created in 1922 and governed the province from its founding until 1958 (after 1932 in an alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party). Green, Hanuschak and Boyce were members of the provincial legislature in 1981, having been elected as NDP candidates. All three had served as cabinet ministers in the government of Edward Schreyer (1969‚Äì1977). The party was regarded as socialist, and promoted traditionally leftist policies such as full employment and increased profits taxation on resource industries. However, it was also influenced by ideas usually associated with the radical right. Green had left the NDP in 1979. Green opposed what he described as \\"special privileges\\" for unions and minority groups, and was particularly opposed to the NDP's plans for anti-scab legislation. These views were reflected in Progressive Party policy. The Progressives were the third-largest party in the provincial legislature (the Liberals having been reduced to one seat in 1977), and sought to run a full slate of candidates in 1981. They were unable to do this, however, and were unable to mount a successful challenge against the dominant NDP and Progressive Conservatives. All Progressive candidates were defeated, including the three incumbents; Green placed a poor third in Inkster, which he had represented since 1966. The Progressive Party never recovered from this early loss. It ran twelve candidates in 1986 (including Green and Hanuschak), but all fared poorly. The party was reduced to six candidates in 1988, although it received some attention for featuring former Premier Douglas Campbell (of the original Progressive Party) at one of its rallies. The Progressives ran five candidates in 1990, the minimum required for ballot status. During its later years, the Progressive Party began veering further to the right. In 1990, its campaign literature emphasized balanced budgets, and rejected distinct status for minority groups. Green, who remained the party's leader throughout all stages of its development, dissolved the Progressive Party on July 13, 1995 when his attempts to find a successor came to nothing.

Such marks, along with parch marks, soil marks and frost marks, can reveal buried archaeological sites not visible from the ground. Description Sketched diagram of a negative cropmark above a wall and a positive cropmark above a ditch Kite aerial photo of crop marks at Nesley, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire. Cereal crop left, beans right. The relative intensity in the crops was reversed in the near infra-red. Crop marks are due to the principle of differential growth. One of the factors controlling the growth of vegetation is the condition of the soil. A buried stone wall, for example, will affect crop growth above it, as its presence channels water away from its area and occupies the space of the more fertile soil. Conversely, a buried ditch, with a fill containing more organic matter than the natural earth, provides much more conducive conditions and water will naturally collect there, nourishing the plants growing above. The differences in conditions will cause some plants to grow more strongly and therefore taller, and others less strongly and therefore shorter. Some species will also react through differential ripening of their fruits or their overall colour. Particularly effective crops that exhibit differential growth include cereal crops, peas, and potatoes. Differential growth will naturally follow any features buried below. Although the growth differences may appear small close up, from the air the pattern they make is more visible, as the small changes can be seen as marked differences in tone or colour in the context of the normally growing surrounding vegetation. When the sun is low to the horizon, shadows cast by the taller crops can also become visible. By their nature crop marks are visible only seasonally and may not be visible at all except in exceptionally wet or dry years. Droughts can be especially useful to cropmark hunters, as the differential growth can become apparent in normally hardy species such as grass. The drought of 2010 produced particularly good conditions for observing crop marks in the UK.BBC news, reporting English Heritage Pre-parching stress in crops and grass, and others factors that may affect plant health, can be captured in near infra-red photography. Near infra-red kite aerial photo at Rufford Abbey, Nottinghamshire, UK Roman Road - The Via Julia, Clifton Down, Bristol An alternative approach is thermal imaging, where differential water loss (which is dependent of the availability of water at the roots) can create temperature differences, which result in thermal crop marks that are potentially visible at any time during crop growth. Thermal imaging can also reveal archaeological residues as a result of thermal inertia (storage heater effect) or differential evaporation. The interaction of the processes involved can be complex and the prediction of optimal imaging time, for a given site, further complicated by environmental conditions including temperature variation and relative humidity. Kite aerial thermogram of Statford Court Playingfields, Stroud, Gloucestershire, UK. Thermal inertia and differential transpiration/evaporation are involved.Archaeological Aerial Thermography and Near Infrared Photography The usefulness of cropmarks to archaeologists has largely been a fruit of inspection from aircraft, but the possibility was suggested by Rev. Gilbert White in The Natural History of Selborne (1789), in a note appended to his Letter VI, to Thomas Pennant, apropos of local people's success in searching for bog oak for house construction, by discovering these trees \\"by the hoar frost, which lay longer over the space where they were concealed, than on the surrounding morass.\\" To White it suggested the query \\"might not such observations be reduced to domestic use, by promoting the discovery of old obliterated drains and wells about houses; and in Roman stations and camps lead to the finding of pavements, baths and graves, and other hidden relics of curious antiquity?\\" Examples After a long hot dry period, cropmark on a lawn caused by a line of flagstones which the grass had overgrown and buried. Examples of archaeological sites where cropmarks have been observed are Balbridie and Fetteresso in Scotland. In 2009, investigation of crop marks near Stonehenge revealed a variety of 6,000-year-old prehistoric subterranean structures. Another example is the rediscovery of the Roman city Altinum, a precursor to the city of Venice, from a combination of visible and near- infrared photos of the area taken during a drought in 2007, which stressed the maize and soy crops.

She pointed out that some features do not produce crop marks and that some crop marks, when excavated, turn out not to be what they seem.

This can be done in order to increase reliability or performance. A typical host or end-user network is connected to just one network. In many circumstances, it can be useful to connect a host or network to multiple networks, in order to increase reliability (if a single link fails, packets can still be routed through the remaining networks) and to improve performance (depending on the destination, it may be more efficient to route through one network or the other).  Variants  There are several different ways to perform multihoming.  Host multihoming  A single host may be connected to multiple networks. For example, a mobile phone might be simultaneously connected to a WiFi network and a 3G network, and a desktop computer might be connected to both a home network and a VPN. A multihomed host usually is assigned multiple addresses, one per connected network.  Classical multihoming  In classical multihoming, a network is connected to multiple providers, and uses its own range of addresses (typically from a Provider Independent (PI) range). The network's edge routers communicate with the providers using a dynamic routing protocol, typically BGP, which announces the network's address range to all providers. If one of the links fails, the dynamic routing protocol recognizes the failure within seconds or minutes, and reconfigures its routing tables to use the remaining links, transparently to the hosts. Classical multihoming is costly, since it requires the use of address space that is accepted by all providers, a public Autonomous System (AS) number, and a dynamic routing protocol. Since multihomed address space cannot be aggregated, it causes growth of the global routing table.http://bgp.potaroo.net/  Multihoming with multiple addresses  In this approach, the network is connected to multiple providers, and assigned multiple address ranges, one for each provider. Hosts are assigned multiple addresses, one for each provider. Multihoming with multiple addresses is cheaper than classical multihoming, and can be used without any cooperation from the providers (e.g. in a home network) but requires additional technology in order to perform routing: * for incoming traffic, hosts must be associated with multiple A or AAAA DNS records so that they are reachable through all providers; * for outgoing traffic, a technique such as source-specific routing must be used to route packets through the correct provider, and reasonable source address selection policies must be implemented by hosts.  Caveats  When multihoming is used to improve reliability, care must be taken to eliminate any single point of failure (SPOF): * Upstream connectivity: A given network operations center must have multiple upstream links to independent providers. Furthermore, to lessen the possibility of simultaneous damage to all upstream links, the physical location of each of these upstream links should be physically diverse: far enough apart that a piece of machinery (such as a backhoe) won't accidentally sever all connections at the same time. * Routers: Routers and switches must be positioned such that no single piece of network hardware controls all network access to a given host. In particular, it is not uncommon to see multiple Internet uplinks all converge on a single edge router. In such a configuration, the loss of that single router disconnects the Internet uplink, despite the fact that multiple ISPs are otherwise in use. * Host connectivity: A \\"reliable\\" host must be connected to the network over multiple network interfaces, each connected to a separate router or switch. Alternatively, and preferably, the function of a given host could be duplicated across multiple computers, each of which is connected to a different router or switch. * Referencing Entities: Not only must a host be accessible, but in many cases it must also be \\"referenced\\" to be useful. For most servers, this means in particular that the name resolution to that server be functional. For example, if the failure of a single element blocks users from properly resolving the DNS name of that server, then the server is effectively inaccessible, despite its otherwise connected state. By increasing the number of interfaces and links being used and making routing less deterministic, multihoming complicates network administration.  IPv4 multihoming Classical multihoming is the dominant technique for IPv4. This requires that a network have its own public IP address range and a public AS number. While multihoming with multiple addresses has been implemented for IPv4, it is not generally used, as host implementations do not deal well with multiple addresses per interface which requires the use of \\"virtual interfaces\\".https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wr-mptcp-single-homed-07 It is also possible to implement multihoming for IPv4 using multiple NAT gateways. IPv6 multihoming Both classical multihoming and multihoming with multiple addresses may be used in IPv6. Classical multihoming Provider Independent Address Space (PI) is available in IPv6.https://www.ripe.net/participate/policies/proposals/2006-01 This technique has the advantage of working like IPv4, supporting traffic balancing across multiple providers, and maintaining existing TCP and UDP sessions through cut-overs. Critics say that the increased size of routing tables needed to handle multi-homing in this way will overwhelm current router hardware. Proponents say that new hardware will be able to handle the increase due to cheaper memory, which drops in price according to Moore's law. Proponents also say this is the only viable solution right now, and the worse is better philosophy supports the idea that it is better to deploy an imperfect solution now than a perfect solution after it is too late. Because many ISPs filter out route announcements with small prefixes, this will generally require a large \\"ISP-sized\\" IP allocation, such as a /32, to ensure global reachability. Using such large prefixes is an inefficient use of IPv6's address space; there are only about 4 billion /32 prefixes. However, from a pragmatic perspective, allocating a /32 is equivalent in global address space cost to allocating a single IPv4 address, and this may be acceptable if, as seems to be likely for the foreseeable future, the number of multihomed sites can be numbered only in the millions, as opposed to the many billions of non- multihomed endpoints which are anticipated to comprise the vast majority of IPv6 endpoints. Some regional Internet registries (RIR) such as RIPE have started to allocate /48 from a specific prefix for this purpose. RIPE allocates IPv6 provider-independent address spaces /48 or shorter from 2001:0678::/29. Multihoming with multiple addresses Multihoming with multiple addresses has been implemented for IPv6.https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtgwg-dst-src-routing-02 For outgoing traffic, this requires support on the host, either protocol agnostic (Multipath TCP, SCTP, etc.) or specific to IPv6 (e.g. SHIM6). Other solutions * Automated renumbering.https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5887 If one uplink goes down, all addresses in the network will be renumbered into a new /48 subnet. DNS and firewall records must be updated to redirect traffic to a different /48 subnet. This renumbering will break live TCP and UDP sessions. * Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) See also * Dual-homed * Host Identity Protocol (HIP) * Identifier/Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) * Load balancing * Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) * Media-independent handover or vertical handover in IEEE 802.21 * Mobile IP * Site Multihoming by IPv6 Intermediation (SHIM6) * Two-sided market References  Further reading   Category:Internet architecture Category:Routing ","title":"Multihoming"},{"id":"641244","text":"Kite aerial photo of the site of Ogilface Castle, Woodend, West Lothian in low sunlight Shadow marks (shadow relief) are a form of archaeological feature visible from the air. Unlike cropmarks, frost marks and soil marks they require upstanding features to work and are therefore more commonly seen in the context of extant sites rather than previously undiscovered buried ones. They are caused by the differences in height on the ground produced by archaeological remains. In the case of ancient, eroded earthworks these differences are often small and they are most apparent when viewed from the air, when the sun is low in the sky. This causes long shadows to be cast by the higher features, which are illuminated from one side by the sun, with dark shadows marking hollows and depressions. Artificial shadow marks can be created easily by constructing a virtual model of a site by merging aerial images (Photogrammetry) and then vectoring in a virtual light source from any direction and at any angle.

The town includes the church of St. Constantine (Aghios Konstantinos). History Kostas Davourlis Stadium The community used to be a village, but Patras's expansion engulfed it during the 1970s and the 1980s. A highway bypass (2.5 km) was built in 1995, which reduced traffic. The section of north Patras is divided into Meso (Inner) Agyias and Exo (Outer) Agyias. Its nearest subdivision (excluding Patras) are Skioessa. Agricultural lands lie to the north and urban sprawl in central and southern areas. The main street is Leoforos Panepistimiou (University Avenue), which leads to the University Town outside Patras (near Rio). Other streets include Afstralias, Agiou Konstantinou or Agyia, Aretha, and Notara. The EOK campground is northwest of the center on Iroon Polytechneiou Street. The Achaiki confection factory was located at the corner of Notara and Panepistimiou; it produced loukoumia (Turkish delight), vanilla sweets, and koufeta (Jordan almonds). The business was established in 1925 by Vassilios Manoussos (1900‚Äì1985) and was continued by his son, Konstantinos (1929‚Äì1997).

It is down the line from London Fenchurch Street and it is situated between to the west and to the east. Its three-letter station code is DDK and it is in Travelcard zone 5. It was opened in 1908. The station and all trains serving it are currently operated by c2c. High Speed 1 and some freight tracks run parallel, however these are not directly accessible from the platforms. It is also an interchange with the East London Transit bus service. History The station opened on 1 July 1908; it was on the original route of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway, but was not one of the original stations. On 18 December 1931, a freight train became divided at Dagenham Dock. Due to a signalman's error, a passenger train ran into the rear portion of the freight. Two people were killed and several were injured in the incident. Ripple Lane Class 47 train departs Ripple Lane. The cranes of the depot can be seen in the background. Situated to the immediate west of the station, the Ripple Lane inter-modal freight depot was originally developed to supply parts from across Europe to the Ford Dagenham plant. Today it has become a base for various continental freight services. In 2009 Stobart Rail commenced a new, weekly refrigerated train service, operated in conjunction with DB Schenker. The from Valencia in Spain terminates at Ripple Lane, providing for an alternative to lorries for the import of fresh Spanish produce. The first fully refrigerated goods service to run through the Channel Tunnel, it is currently the longest train journey in Europe by a single operator. On the return journey to Spain, the train carries pallets for CHEP. Redevelopment Although the station is relatively poorly served and located in an industrial area, there are plans to redevelop the area as London Riverside. Under these plans the station has become the southern terminus of phase one of the East London TransitTransport for London - East London Transit route map and it is proposed that an eastern extension of the Docklands Light Railway would terminate here.Transport for London - DLR takes first steps toward Dagenham. 29 January 2007. Beam Park railway station is planned to be constructed as a new station to the east of Dagenham Dock.

Although the battle was a victory for the Greeks, their casualties were so high that they were eventually compelled to withdraw from Italy. It is from this battle that the term \\"pyrrhic victory\\" is derived, meaning a victory at such high cost as to amount to a defeat. Background Tarentum was a Greek colony, part of Magna Graecia. The members of the leading faction in Tarentum, the democrats under Philocharis or Ainesias, were against Rome, because they knew that if the Romans entered Tarentum the Greeks would lose their independence. The Greeks in Tarentum had grown afraid of Roman expansion after the Third Samnite War. After the surrender of the Samnites in 290 BC, the Romans founded many colonies in Apulia and Lucania, the most important of which was Venusia. In 282 BC, after a battle against the Samnites, Lucanians, Bruttians and Thurii, Roman troops entered the Italian Greek colonies of Croton, Lokroi, and Rhegium. Democrats from Tarentum knew that as soon as Rome finished its war with the Gauls, Lucanians, Etruscans, Samnites, and Bruttians, they would enter Tarentum. Another event that concerned the Tarentines was that the aristocratic faction of Thurii that had taken power had invited a Roman garrison into their city; the Tarentines, who had been the referents of all the Magna Graecia colonies, were deeply worried about this fact. The second faction in Tarentum were the aristocrats, led by Agis, who did not oppose surrendering to Rome, as it would lead to the return of the aristocratic faction to power. The aristocrats, however, could not surrender directly and become unpopular with the population. In the autumn of 282 BC, Tarentum celebrated their festival of Dionysus; while in their theatre in front of sea, they saw ten Roman ships, with soldiers and supplies for the Roman garrison of Thurii, entering the Gulf of Taranto. According to Kƒôciek, the Tarentine aristocracy asked the Roman commanders Publius Cornelius and Lucius Valerius to arrest and execute the democrats and their followers, which would allow the aristocrats to surrender. The Tarentines were angry, because the Romans had signed an agreement not to sail into the Gulf of Taranto, and they prepared their navy to attack the Roman ships. A few of the ships were sunk, and one was captured. The Tarentines knew that they had few chances of victory against Rome. They decided to call for help from Pyrrhus, King of Epirus. The army and fleet of Tarentum moved to Thurii and helped the democrats there exile the aristocrats. The Roman garrison placed in Thurii withdrew. The Romans sent a diplomatic mission to settle the matter and take back the prisoners but the negotiations ended abruptly, so Rome declared war on Tarentum. In 281 BC, Roman legions under the command of Lucius Aemilius Barbula entered Tarentum and plundered it. Tarentum, with Samnite and Salentine reinforcements, then lost a battle against the Romans. After the battle the Greeks chose Agis to sign a truce and begin diplomatic talks. These talks were also broken off when 3,000 soldiers from Epirus under the command of Milon entered the town. The Roman consul withdrew and suffered losses from attacks by the Greek ships. Pyrrhus decided to help Tarentum because he was in debt to them ‚Äî they had earlier helped him conquer the island of Corcyra. He also believed that he could count on help from the Samnites, Lucanians, Etruscans, Umbrians, and Bruttians, and some Illyrian tribes, all peoples with a history of conflict with Rome. His ultimate goal was to re-conquer Macedon he had lost in 285 BC, but did not have enough money to recruit soldiers. He planned to help Tarentum, then go to Sicily and attack Carthage. After winning a war against Carthage and capturing south Italy he would have enough money to organise a strong army and capture Macedon. Preparation Before he left Epirus, Pyrrhus formed an alliance and borrowed soldiers and money from the pretender to the Macedonian throne, Ptolemy Keraunos. His long-time friend and ally Ptolemy II Philadelphus, king of Ptolemaic Egypt, also promised to send 9,000 soldiers and 50 war elephants. He also recruited cavalry from Thessaly and archers and slingers from Rhodes ‚Äî as their rulers wanted to avoid a war with Epirus. In the spring of 280 BC Pyrrhus landed without losses in Italy. After hearing of Pyrrhus' arrival in Italy the Romans mobilized eight legions with auxiliaries, totalling about 80,000 soldiers. They divided it into four armies: *One army under the command of Barbula, with orders to distract the Samnites and Lucanians so they could not join Pyrrhus' army. They were placed in Venusia. *A second army left behind to secure Rome. *A third army under the command of consul Tiberius Coruncanius marched against Etruscans, to avoid an alliance between them and Pyrrhus. *A fourth army under the command of Publius Valerius Laevinus marched to Tarentum. They also plundered Lucania. Publius Laevinus moved towards Heraclea, a city founded by the Tarentines, with the intention of cutting Pyrrhus off from the Greek colonies of Calabria, thus avoiding their uprising against Rome.

When he understood that reinforcements were not coming, he decided to fight the Romans on a plain near the river Siris (modern Sinni), between Pandosia and Heraclea. Pyrrhus took up position there and waited. Before the fight he sent diplomats to the Roman consul, proposing that he could arbitrate the conflicts between Rome and the population of southern Italy. He asserted that his allies recognised him as a judge and demanded the same recognition from the Romans. The Romans denied his request, and entered the plain on the right of the Siris river, where they set up camp. It is unknown how many troops Pyrrhus had left in Tarentum, it is estimated he had about 25‚Äì35,000 troops with him at Heraclea. He took up position on the left bank of the Siris, hoping that the Romans would have difficulty crossing the river, which would allow him more time to prepare his attack. He set up some light infantry units near the river to let him know when the Romans began to cross, and planned first to attack them with his cavalry and elephants. Valerius Laevinus had about 42,000 soldiers under his command, including cavalry, velites, and spearmen. It would be the first time in history that two very different juggernauts of war clashed: the Roman Legion and the Macedonian Phalanx. At dawn, the Romans started to cross the river Siris. On the flanks the Roman cavalry attacked the scouts and light infantry, who were forced to flee. When Pyrrhus learned that the Romans had begun crossing the river he led his Macedonian and Thessalian cavalry to attack the Roman cavalry. His infantry, with peltasts and archers and heavy infantry, began their march as well. The Epirote cavalry successfully disrupted the Roman battle formation and then withdrew. Pyrrhus' peltasts, slingers, and archers began to shoot and his sarissa-wielding phalanxes began to attack. The infantry line was near equal to the Romans' in length as, although Pyrrhus had a small advantage in number, the phalanx was by design deeper than the legion. The phalanxes made seven attacks, but failed to pierce the legion. It had met a foe that was stronger than any it had ever encountered. The Romans made seven attacks, yet they could not break the phalanx, and the battle hung in the air. At one point, the battle became so pitched that Pyrrhus‚Äîrealizing that if he were to fall in combat, his soldiers would lose heart and run‚Äîswitched armor with one of his bodyguards. This bodyguard was subsequently killed, and word spread through the ranks that Pyrrhus had fallen. His force began to waver, and the Romans gave a thunderous cheer at the turn of events. Grasping the magnitude of the situation, Pyrrhus rode forward, bare-headed, along the lines of his men to show he was still living. This show of bravery strengthened their resolve. A massive cheer went up from the Greek line, and the battle raged on. Unable to make any significant gains in action, Pyrrhus deployed his war elephants, held in reserve until now. The Roman cavalry was threatening his flank too strongly. Aghast at the sight of these strange and brooding creatures which none had seen before, the horses galloped away and threw the Roman legion into rout. (The Romans subsequently called elephants , after the location of this first encounter.). Pyrrhus then launched his Thessalian cavalry among the disorganized legions, which completed the Romans' defeat. The Romans fell back across the river and Pyrrhus held the field. In the opinion of Dionysius, the Romans lost 15,000 soldiers and had thousands taken prisoner; Hieronymus states 7,000. Dionysius totalled Pyrrhus' losses at around 11,000 soldiers, 3,000 according to Hieronymus. Either way, this could be considered the earliest of his Pyrrhic victories against Rome. Aftermath After the battle reinforcements from south Italy joined Pyrrhus. The Greeks of Rhegium who wanted to join him were massacred by Roman soldiers under the command of Decius Vibelius, who was proclaimed ruler of the town. Pyrrhus then began to march towards Rome. He captured many small towns in Campania, and his forces plundered Latium. His march was stopped in Anagni, two days from Rome, when he met the other Roman consular army under Tiberius Coruncanius. Pyrrhus was afraid that he did not have enough soldiers to fight, and knew Laevinus and Barbula were probably marching behind him. Instead he withdrew and the Romans did not follow him.

Cromwell is between (linking to Wanaka, north, and Queenstown, west) and State Highway 8 leading to the Lindis Pass, northeast, and Alexandra, 33 km south. The road to Alexandra winds through the Cromwell Gorge. A point near Cromwell lies 119 kilometres from the sea, the farthest from the sea anywhere in New Zealand. A prominent feature surrounding much of the town is the man- made Lake Dunstan. Cromwell also has the newly constructed Highlands Motorsport Park. Nearby settlements are at Bannockburn, Lowburn, Tarras, and Ripponvale. Cromwell is also the home of the Cromwell Chafer Beetle (Prodontria lewisi). The 45th parallel south runs just north of the township.  History  Cromwell was originally known as \\"The Junction\\", being at the confluence of the Clutha and Kawarau Rivers. In 1862, gold was discovered below the Junction by two miners, Hartley and Reilly. Once the word of a gold strike was out, there was an influx of several thousand miners to the area. Its newspaper, The Cromwell Argus, was established in 1869. As gold ran out, Cromwell became the service centre for an extensive farming and stone fruit growing area. It has a strategic location between the Lindis and the Haast passes, and acts as a hub between the towns of Wanaka, Queenstown and Alexandra. The former is commemorated with the giant sculpture of stone fruit which stands outside the northern end of the town. Cromwell lay at the confluence of the Clutha River and Kawarau River, which was noted for the difference between the colours of the waters of the two rivers and also for the historic bridge at the convergence of the two. Since the construction of the Clyde Dam and the filling of Lake Dunstan in the early 1990s the river confluence was drowned, as was the old town centre. The decision to build Clyde Dam and use Cromwell as the accommodation base brought many changes to the town. Approximately one-third of the town was rebuilt on higher ground. The changes included the doubling of the residential area, relocation of the old town centre (now called \\"Old Cromwell Town\\"), upgrading of services, and the provision of modern educational and sports facilities, and a new bridge. The relocated town centre, or \\"The Mall,\\" now houses the main retail, service and civic buildings in Cromwell. Several of the old buildings of the town which escaped the flooding have been retained as a historic precinct close to the shore of the Kawarau. The town was named after Oliver Cromwell and, as well as \\"The Junction\\", the town was previously known as \\"The Point\\" and \\"Kawarau\\". Cromwell is nicknamed the \\"Fruit Bowl of the South\\".  Climate  Cromwell receives around 400 mm of rain a year due to its inland location. Although it is widely believed to have a continental climate, the town officially has an oceanic climate (Cfb) with rainfall just enough to escape the semi-arid climate (Bsk) classification.  Demography  The Cromwell urban area had a usual resident population of 5,610 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,269 people (29.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 1,866 people (49.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 2,898 males and 2,709 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.07 males per female. Of the total population, 1,044 people (18.6%) were aged up to 15 years, 909 (16.2%) were 15 to 29, 2,604 (46.4%) were 30 to 64, and 1,050 (18.7%) were 65 or older. Ethnicities were 90.1% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 9.1% MƒÅori, 2.0% Pacific peoples, 3.9% Asian, and 2.5% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).

Cromwell Station Yard Plan Bannockburn An historic town which was once the centre of a thriving and successful gold mining industry. Remnants include the hotel, Post Office, Stewart's store, and many old dwellings. Now a restful area centred on viticulture and agriculture. The Bannockburn Sluicings Walk through an incredible landscape changed by hand in the pursuit of gold. The round trip is full of history and interest. Bendigo Goldfields Bendigo was a successful quartz mining area for over half a century. From the site of the old Bendigo township at the top of the Bendigo Loop Road a steep, narrow vehicle track winds up into the hills to Logantown and even further up to Welshtown, where some of the most striking remains of old stone cottages can be found. Carrick Goldfields The ruins of Carricktown are 4 km up a 4WD track from the old mining area of Quartzville (near the end of Quartzville Road), and the Young Australian 6m overshot water-wheel can be found a further 3 km on. The track continues up to Duffer's Saddle. Return down Nevis Road to Bannockburn. Cromwell Gorge Hartley and Reilly first discovered gold at the beginning of this rugged and spectacular gorge. Old Cromwell Town Old Cromwell Town's historic street (Melmore Terrace), 2014 The construction of the Clyde Dam created Lake Dunstan, which consumed part of the old Cromwell town. The deep river gorge, famed for its picturesque beauty, lined with orchards and vineyards, and especially the meeting point of two distinct rivers, was reformed with an artificially constructed shoreline. Though the original orchards were lost, Cromwell's climate has allowed it to maintain its reputation for wine and fruit production.

She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Zorba the Greek (1964), and the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical for the same role in the musical version of the film. Life and career Yelizaveta Nikolayevna Kedrova was born in Petrograd, Russia. Cagey about her age, she gave 1918 as her year of birth but is now believed to have been born in 1909, if not earlier. Her parents were Russian opera singers. Her father, Nikolay Kedrov Sr. (1871‚Äì1940), was a singer and composer, a creator of the first Russian male quartet to perform liturgical chants. Her mother, Sofia Gladkaya (ru: –°–æ—Ñ—å—è –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–Ω–∞ –ì–ª–∞–¥–∫–∞—è), was a singer at the Mariinsky Theatre and a teacher at the Conservatoire de Paris. Kedrova's brother Nikolay Kedrov Jr. (c. 1904‚Äì1981) was a Russian singer and composer of liturgical music. Her sister, Irene Kedroff (Irina Nikolayevna Kedrova), was a soprano. Some time after the October Revolution, in 1922, the family emigrated to Berlin. In 1928, they moved to France, where Kedrova's mother taught at the Conservatoire de Paris, and her father again recreated the quartet \\"Quatuor Kedroff\\". In 1932, Kedrova joined the Moscow Art Theatre touring company. Then her film career began, mostly in French films, until her first English appearance in 1964 as Mme Hortense in Zorba the Greek. Her performance won her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Kedrova then appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's 1966 film Torn Curtain, playing the role of Countess Kuchinska, a Polish noblewoman in East Berlin who is desperate to emigrate to the United States. Kedrova played Fr√§ulein Schneider in the West End stage production of Cabaret in 1968 with Judi Dench and Peter Sallis. She then played a series of eccentric and crazy women in Hollywood films. In 1983, she reprised her role as Mme Hortense on Broadway in the musical version of Zorba the Greek, winning both a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical and a Drama Desk Award in the process. In 1989, she played Madame Armfeldt in the London revival of A Little Night Music. Her second husband was Canadian stage director Richard Howard (1932‚Äì2017). Death In 2000, Kedrova died at her summer home in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, of pneumonia, having suffered a long time with Alzheimer's disease. She was cremated. Her ashes are buried in her family grave in the Russian cemetery in Paris.

It is located 130 kilometers northwest of Christchurch and 65 kilometers southwest of Kaikoura (135 km by car), in the Hurunui District. The town lies on a minor road 9 kilometers north of State Highway 7, the northern route between Christchurch and the West Coast via Lewis Pass. The township lies at the base of Conical Hill. Mount Isobel (1324 metres) looks over Hanmer Springs. Jacks Pass and Jollies Pass provide access to the Molesworth and Rainbow roads  Demographics  In 2006, Hanmer Springs had a population of 729. According to the 2013 census, this had increased to 840 and then in 2018 it had increased again to 960 residents. The median age of the residents in 2018 was 41.9 years old. In terms of ethnicity, 86.9% of residents identified as European, 5.9% identified as Maori and 9.1% identified as of Maori descent. The majority of residents were born in New Zealand (69.7%). The majority of residents identified with no religion (56.6%) while a sizeable minority (31.2%) identified as Christian. The majority of residents (61.5%) were in full time employment. The median income was $35,300 with 14.1% earning over $70,000. In 2018, there were 402 occupied private dwellings and a further 603 unoccupied private dwellings. History Statue of Thomas Hanmer, located in central Hanmer Springs. The town is named after Thomas Hanmer, an owner of Hawkeswood Station near the Conway River during the 1850s. Thomas Hanmer was born in Hanmer, Wales. He arrived at Port Lyttleton in 1852. While searching for suitable farming land, he joined a party of surveyors working in the Amuri District. During this period he was linked with Hanmer Springs, although he never lived there. He was the manager of the St Leonards Station near Culverden from 1855 to 1857. He then moved to Queensland, Australia. There is a statue of Thomas Hanmer in the center of Hanmer Springs. The locality was discovered for its hot springs by William Jones in early 1859. Access to the general area was provided by a bridge over the Waiau River in 1864 constructed by a Mr Handisides of Nelson for NZ¬£2,000 to a design by John Blackett. The bridge lasted only ten years before it was blown over by a Nor'west wind. John Turnbull Thomson surveyed the land for the township in 1879, with the total area comprising , of which were for the township itself. The hot springs were not included within that area. The springs themselves were still in their natural state at that time, with only steps and a changing shed provided. The member for , Edward George Wright, brought up the question of developing the township in the New Zealand House of Representatives in June 1882. The Minister of Lands, William Rolleston, replied that it was important that the public should retain access to the springs. Surveyor Walter Kitson was instructed with laying out the site of the hot springs including an accommodation house. Construction of a bath house began in January 1884. The fifty year jubilee was held in 1933, stating that Hanmer had been a government resort since 1883, but the centenary book pointed out that the jubilee was held a year too early. The government investing significant funds into Hanmer Springs without a bridge crossing the Waiau River caused considerable controversy. Blackett designed a new bridge and John Anderson from Christchurch won the contract to erect it, and built a foundry at the site. This second bridge opened in 1887 and gives access to Hanmer to this day, with the structure registered as a Category I heritage item since 1983. The opening celebrations held by Anderson's sons at the site were rather liberal to the extent that the site is still known as Champagne Flat.  Climate  Hanmer Springs has temperatures that range between Summer temperatures of an average daily high of 22 degrees Celsius and an average daily low of 9 degrees Celsius in January and February and winter temperatures with an average daily high of 9 degrees Celsius and an average daily low of 1 degree Celsius in July. Rainfall is highest on average in July with 107 mm and lowest in January with 55 mm Snow falls in Hanmer Springs in winter and often closes the road into Hanmer Springs. In summer, Hanmer Springs often has very hot summer conditions for New Zealand with temperatures getting above 35 degrees Celsius.  Hanmer Springs Forest  An art trail exists within the Hanmer Springs Forest In order to provide timber for the Christchurch market, reserve land was set aside between 1900‚Äì1901. The planting of exotic trees began in 1902, and in 1903 prison labour was used. The prisoners who took part in the planting resided at a nearby prison camp which operated until 1913. A variety of trees were planted including black pines, Norway spruce and deciduous larch, with alders in wet areas, and oaks and silver birches planted as amenity species. The oldest area of the forest (203 hectares) is protected under a Crown covenant. Many woody species have invaded this forest from the township‚Äôs gardens. In 1964 pupils of Hanmer Primary School planted a 0.6 hectare block of pinus nigra in order to commemorate Arbor day. A number of walking trails now go through this mature forest.Sign in the Hanmer Forest detailing history of the plantings. Sited October 2020. The Government in 2000 sold the North Canterbury Crown Forests to Ngai Tahu as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement. Thus the Hanmer Springs Forests passed into private ownership. In 2008 a memorandum of understanding was signed by Matariki Forests, Hanmer Heritage Trust and the Hurunui District Council that protected the ongoing right for public access to the Hanmer Springs Forest. The Hurunui District Council would now responsible for the maintenance of the tracks within the forest. Economy The town is built around hot springs which originate in the fractured rock bed along the Hanmer fault. Hanmer Springs' Queen Mary Hospital, formerly the South Island's leading rehabilitation center for sufferers of drug addiction, was closed in 2003. The premises were purchased by the Department of Conservation in 2008. Hot pools In 1960 the local community purchased the hot pools and gifted them to the local council. The three hexagonal pools which are still in use currently and a fresh water pool were built in 1978. Changing rooms and a new entrance way were constructed in 1985. The rock pools were build in 1992 and further Sulphur pools constructed in 1999. In 2009, a 4600 square meter extension to the hot pools complex was proposed including \\"a second [16m high] water-slide, ice-skating rink and relocating and reconfiguring the freshwater pool.\\"\\"Growth of site opposed by trust\\" written by Marc Greenhill, The Press, Saturday 28 November 2009 pp. A11 During the consent process oppositions were made to it by, among others, the Queen Mary Reserve Trust concerning the expansions effect on noise levels and visual impact. Concerns were also raised by former hospital superintendent, Dr Robert Crawford, about the change the development might have on the village's brand of \\"slow tourism and relaxation, not wet‚Äôn‚Äôwild.\\"\\"Growth of site opposed by trust\\" written by Marc Greenhill, The Press, 28 November 2009 pp. A11 An early morning view of the Hanmer Springs Hot Pools and hydroslides with Mount Isobel in the background.

Project Prometheus/Project Promethian was established in 2003 by NASA to develop nuclear-powered systems for long-duration space missions. This was NASA's first serious foray into nuclear spacecraft propulsion since the cancellation of the SNTP project in 1995. The project was cancelled in 2005. Its budget shrank from $252.6 million in 2005 to only $100 million in 2006, $90 million of which was for closeout costs on cancelled contracts. Namesake Originally named the \\"Nuclear Systems Initiative\\", Project Prometheus was named for the wisest of the Titans in Greek mythology who gave the gift of fire to humanity. NASA said the name Prometheus indicates its hopes of establishing a new tool for understanding nature and expanding capabilities for the exploration of the Solar System. Motivations Due to their distance from the Sun, spacecraft exploring the outer planets are severely limited in that they cannot use solar power as a source of electrical energy for onboard instrumentation or for ion propulsion systems. Previous missions to the outer planets such as Voyager and Galileo probe have relied on radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) as their primary power source. Unlike RTGs which rely on heat produced by the natural decay of radioactive isotopes, Project Prometheus called for the use of a small nuclear reactor as the primary power source. The primary advantages of this would have been: *Increased power generation compared to RTGs, allowing scientists and engineers more flexibility in both mission design and operations. *Increased spacecraft longevity. *Increased range and propulsion power. *High speed data links. Missions Prometheus I (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter) Missions planned to involve Prometheus Nuclear Systems and Technology included: *Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter *Exploration of the Jovian moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Originally planned to be the first mission of Project Prometheus, it was deemed too complex and expensive, and its funding was cut in the 2006 budget. NASA instead considered a demonstration mission to a target closer to Earth to test out the reactor and heat rejection systems, possibly with a spacecraft scaled down from its original size. Technology Project Prometheus was focused on Nuclear electric propulsion: :Development of spacecraft powered by nuclear reactors to generate electricity. :This electricity would then be used to run ion engines. It did not study nor pursue nuclear thermal propulsion (e.g. NERVA) Collaboration Project Prometheus would have had substantial involvement of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Naval Reactors, which oversees the nuclear reactor program of the U.S. Navy, was to participate in the design and construction of the reactors for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter.

It is on the Malay peninsula in the southern part of the country. Covering an area of 1,040 km2 it borders the provinces of Songkhla and Phatthalung. Despite being called a lake, this water feature is actually a lagoon complex geologically. The lake is divided into three distinct parts. The southern part opens with a 380 m wide strait to the Gulf of Thailand at the city of Songkhla. Here it contains brackish water about half the salinity of seawater. Further north, after a narrowing to 6 km width, is the Thale Luang (782.80 km2). At the northern end between mangrove swamps is the 28 km2 Thale Noi in Phatthalung Province. The most striking feature is the long 75 km long spit which separates the lake from the sea. Unlike most spits, it was probably formed when originally existing islands were connected by silting from the lake precursor. Ramsar wetlands The Phru Khuan Khi Sian wetlands near the Thale Noi Lake have been protected as a Ramsar wetland since 1998. It is part of the larger Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area, created in 1975.Wetlands in Thale Noi Wildlife Non-Hunting Area Kuan Ki Sian of the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area is at 07¬∫50‚ÄôN 100¬∫08‚ÄôE in a non-hunting area, Phatthalung. Just north of the very large Thale Luang (Lake Songkhla complex) in the south of the country, it is one of the few surviving intact freshwater wetland ecosystems in Thailand. Among the specific wetland types found here are lake, marsh, Melaleuca (also termed \\"paperbark\\") swamp forest, paddy fields, and swamp grasslands. \\"Kuans\\" are islands free of water for most of the year in the Melaleuca swamp forest. Kuan Ki Sian is a knoll at 0‚Äì2 meters above mean sea level in the Thale Noi area. The Thale Noi area is home to more than 5,000 families, almost all of whom rely on resource extraction or other land use within the area. Activities include fishing, cattle grazing, cultivation, mat-making and tourism. The site is visited by more than 200,000 visitors annually. Irrawaddy dolphin A small population of Irrawaddy dolphins is found in Thale Luang, near the Si-Ha Islands of Phatthalung. They are threatened with extinction by overfishing and pollution.

The Rhenish dynasty has had close ties to the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia since 1736. History Though older sources mentioned one Eberhard zu Eltz, a Frankish citizen of Trier in the late 7th century, the first recorded instance of the name occurred in 1157, when Rudolph zu Eltz was mentioned as witness to the donation of a property deed by Emperor Fredrick Barbarossa. At that time, Eltz lived in a small manor on the banks of the River Elz, a tributary of the Moselle, in what is now the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The family members had been ministeriales and loyal supporters of the Imperial Hohenstaufen dynasty. In the early 14th century they inherited the Vogtei over R√ºbenach near Koblenz, a possession of Imperial Abbey of St Maximin at Trier. Eltz Castle was built in the early 12th century on a site that held a 9th- century manor house with a simple earthwork palisade.de Fabianis, p. 135 Before 1268 three brothers shared the ownership of the castle and it was kept jointly by their descendants, the Kempenich, Rodendorf and R√ºbenach branches until 1815 when it was taken over by the Kempenich branch, which still owns it today. Eltz Castle, owned by the family since before 1157 From 1331 until 1336 the Eltz were stuck in a fierce feud with mighty Baldwin of Luxembourg, then Elector and Prince-Archbishop of Trier enforcing his acknowledgement as their suzerain, whereafter the Eltz family remained vassals of the Trier archbishops. In 1324 Pope John XXII had appointed Canon Arnold von Eltz Prince-Bishop of Cammin in Pomerania against the resistance of King Louis IV. Robin von Eltz served as Master of the Livonian Order from 1385 until 1389. Canon Jakob zu Eltz was elected Prince-Archbishop of Trier in 1567; he was one of the strongest champions of the Counter-Reformation and allied himself with the Jesuits in opposing Lutheran and Calvinist influence in the region. In 1624, Hans Jakob zu Eltz was given the hereditary office of Field Marshal for the Electorate of Trier. This made him the supreme military commander of the region in time of war, including leader of the vassals on this important region of the Holy Roman Empire. The Eltz family, Imperial Knights since 1729, reached their greatest influence with Philipp Karl von Eltz-Kempenich, from 1732 Prince Elector and Archbishop of Mainz and German Archchancellor, making him the most noble and one of the most powerful Catholic princes north of the Alps. As a result of their service throughout the troubles of the Reformation and during the wars against the Ottoman Empire, the elder line of Eltz were awarded the title of Reichsgrafen (Counts of the Empire) by the Habsburg Emperor Charles VI in 1733 in Vienna. The additional \\"Great Palatinate\\" privilege entitled the Eltz lords to knight others in the name of the Emperor, select notaries public, legitimate illegitimate children, confer coats of arms and crests, appoint judges and clerks, and release serfs from service. In 1736 Archbishop Philipp Karl von Eltz had acquired the Lordship of Vukovar in eastern Slavonia (present-day Croatia) affiliated with the Hungarian nobility. From 1749 onwards his heirs had Eltz Manor erected, the main residence of the Grafen von und zu Eltz until the family was expelled by the Yugoslav communist regime in 1945. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Jakob Eltz returned to Croatia and as a naturalized citizen became a member of the new Sabor parliament, where he represented Vukovar. During the Battle of Vukovar, the Eltz Manor in Vukovar was destroyed by intense shelling and the bodies in the Eltz tomb desecrated by Serbian forces. Jakob Eltz, then in his 70s, personally took part in the defence of the city.

CONTINUOUS AND DISCONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS VI DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS VII ADDITIONAL THEOREMS IN THE DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL CALCULUS VIII THE CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES AND INFINITE INTEGRALS IX THE LOGARITHMIC, EXPONENTIAL AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS OF A REAL VARIABLE X THE GENERAL THEORY OF THE LOGARITHMIC, EXPONENTIAL AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS Appendices INDEX Review The book was intended to help reform mathematics teaching in the UK, and more specifically in the University of Cambridge and in schools preparing to study higher mathematics. It was aimed directly at \\"scholarship level\\" students ‚Äì the top 10% to 20% by ability. Hardy himself did not originally find a passion for mathematics, only seeing it as a way to beat other students, which he did decisively, and gain scholarships. However, his book excels in effectively explaining analytical number theory and calculus following the rigor of mathematics. Its publication came a year after that of Theory of Functions of a Real Variable by E.W. Hobson, which may partly have been its inspiration. Whilst his book changed the way the subject was taught at university, the content reflects the era in which the book was written. The whole book explores number theory and the author constructs real numbers theoretically. It adequately deals with single-variable calculus, sequences, number series, properties of cos, sin, log, etc. but does not refer to mathematical groups, multi-variable functions or vector calculus. Each section includes some demanding problems. Hardy combines the enthusiasm of the missionary with the rigor of the purist in his exposition of the fundamental ideas of the differential and integral calculus, of the properties of infinite series and of other topics involving the notion of limit. Hardy's presentation of mathematical analysis is as valid today as when first written: students will find that his economical and energetic style of presentation is one that modern authors rarely come close to. Despite its limitations, it is considered a classic in its field. It is probably of most use to 1st year university students of pure mathematics.

A raw vegan Thanksgiving \\"Turkey\\". The veganism diet also has a raw variety. Raw foodism, also known as rawism or following a raw food diet, is the dietary practice of eating only or mostly food that is uncooked and unprocessed. Depending on the philosophy, or type of lifestyle and results desired, raw food diets may include a selection of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, eggs, fish, meat, and dairy products. The diet may also include simply processed foods, such as various types of sprouted seeds, cheese, and fermented foods such as yogurts, kefir, kombucha, or sauerkraut, but generally not foods that have been pasteurized, homogenized, or produced with the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, solvents, and food additives.

Varieties Raw food diets are diets composed entirely or mostly of food that is uncooked or that is cooked at low temperatures. Raw animal food diets Included in raw animal food diets are any food that can be eaten raw, such as uncooked, unprocessed raw muscle-meats/organ-meats/eggs, raw dairy, and aged, raw animal foods such as century eggs, fermented meat/fish/shellfish/kefir, as well as vegetables/fruits/nuts/sprouts/honey, but in general not raw grains, raw beans, and raw soy. Raw foods included on such diets have not been heated above . Examples of raw animal food diets include the Primal Diet, anopsology (otherwise known as \\"Instinctive Eating\\" or \\"Instincto\\"), and the Raw Paleolithic diet (otherwise known as the \\"Raw Meat Diet\\"). The Primal Diet consists of fatty meats, organ meats, dairy, honey, minimal fruit and vegetable juices, and coconut products, all raw, whereas the \\"Raw, Paleolithic Diet\\", is a raw version of the (cooked) Paleolithic Diet, incorporating large amounts of raw animal foods such as meats/organ-meats, seafood, eggs, and some raw plant-foods, but usually avoiding non-Paleo foods such as raw dairy, grains, and legumes. A number of traditional aboriginal diets consisted of large quantities of raw meats, organ meats, and berries, including the traditional diet of the Nenets tribe of Siberia and the Inuit people. File:Kefir-insieme.jpgKefir preparation Image:Sashimi.jpgA sashimi dinner set Raw veganism Raw vegan apple pie Raw veganism has rarely been practiced in history, but it has become more of a trend recently. A raw vegan diet consists of unprocessed, raw plant foods that have not been heated above . Typical foods included in raw food diets are fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and sprouted grains and legumes. Among raw vegans are subgroups, such as fruitarians, juicearians, or sproutarians. Fruitarians eat primarily or exclusively fruits, berries, seeds, and nuts. Juicearians process their raw plant foods into juice. Sproutarians adhere to a diet consisting mainly of sprouted seeds. The British Dietetic Association named the raw vegan diet one of the \\"top 5 worst celeb diets to avoid in 2018\\", raising a concern that it could compromise long-term health. History Early documentation of raw food dieting has been associated with hermits and monks practicing asceticism. For example, John of Egypt a hermit from the Nitrian Desert lived on a diet of dried fruit and vegetables for fifty years, he never ate anything cooked.Bangley, Bernard. (2005). Butler's Lives of the Saints: Concise, Modernized Edition. Paraclete Press. p. 67. Documented evidence (in the hagiography of Yafq…ôr√§nn√§ ∆égziÀÄ) of a commitment to raw food was by the Ethiopian monk Qozmos, who in the late 1300s CE committed to the ascetic discipline of eating only uncooked food.Kaplan, Steven. \\"Qozmos.\\" Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: O-X: Vol. 4, edited by Siegbert Uhlig, Harrassowitz, 2010, p. 303. This posed a problem for his Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church monastery because he refused to eat the bread of the Eucharist, which is cooked. As a result, he fled the church and went to live with the Jewish community of the Beta Israel. Contemporary raw food diets were first developed in Switzerland by Maximilian Bircher-Benner (1867 ‚Äì 1939), who was influenced as a young man by the German Lebensreform movement, which saw civilization as corrupt and sought to go \\"back to nature\\"; it embraced holistic medicine, nudism, free love, exercise and other outdoors activity, and foods that it judged were more \\"natural\\". Bircher-Benner eventually adopted a vegetarian diet, but took that further and decided that raw food was what humans were really meant to eat; he was influenced by Charles Darwin's ideas that humans were just another kind of animal and Bircher-Benner noted that other animals do not cook their food. In 1904 he opened a sanatorium in the mountains outside of Zurich called \\"Lebendinge Kraft\\" or \\"Vital Force,\\" a technical term in the Lebensreform movement that referred especially to sunlight; he and others believed that this energy was more \\"concentrated\\" in plants than in meat, and was diminished by cooking. Patients in the clinic were fed raw foods, including muesli, which was created there. These ideas were influential to Ann Wigmore a notable raw food advocate but were dismissed by scientists and the medical profession as quackery. One of the earliest books to advocate raw foodism was Eugene Christian's Uncooked Foods and How to Use Them, 1904.Berry, Rynn. (2007). \\"Raw Foodism\\". In Andrew F. Smith. The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink. Oxford University Press. pp. 493-494. Other proponents from the early part of the twentieth century include Californian fruit grower Otto Carque (author of The Foundation of All Reform, 1904), George Julius Drews (author of Unfired Food and Trophotherapy, 1912), Bernarr Macfadden and Herbert Shelton. Drews influenced John and Vera Richter to open America's first raw food restaurant \\"The Eutropheon\\" in 1917. Shelton was arrested, jailed, and fined numerous times for practicing medicine without a license during his career as an advocate of rawism and other alternative health and diet philosophies.Herbert M. Shelton Shelton's legacy, as popularized by books like Fit for Life by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond, has been deemed \\"pseudonutrition\\" by the National Council Against Health Fraud. In the 1970s, Norman W. Walker (inventor of the Norwalk Juicing Press) popularized raw food dieting.Coull, Lauren. (2015). \\"Raw Food\\". In Andrew F. Smith. Savoring Gotham: A Food Lover's Companion to New York City. Oxford University Press. pp. 490-491. Leslie Kenton's book Raw Energy - Eat Your Way to Radiant Health, published in 1984, added popularity to foods such as sprouts, seeds, and fresh vegetable juices. The book advocates a diet of 75% raw food, which it claims will prevent degenerative diseases, slow the effects of aging, provide enhanced energy, and boost emotional balance; it cites examples such as the sprouted-seed-enriched diets of the long-lived Hunza people and Gerson therapy, an unhealthy, dangerous and potentially very harmful raw juice-based diet and detoxification regime claimed to treat cancer. Claims Claims held by raw food proponents include: * That heating food above starts to degrade and destroy the enzymes in raw food that aid digestion. Enzymes in food play no significant role in the digestive process, prior to being digested themselves. * That raw foods have higher nutrient values than foods that have been cooked. In reality, whether cooking degrades nutrients or increases their availability, or both, depends on the food and how it is cooked. * That cooked foods, and especially meat, contain harmful toxins, which can cause chronic disease and other problems, including trans fatty acids produced by heating oil, acrylamide produced by frying, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. While it is true that a healthy diet minimizes fried food and red meat, not all cooked food contains harmful chemicals (a serving of french fries has 200 times the AGEs of a bowl of cooked oatmeal), and a diet containing a normal mix of cooked and raw food does not shorten life. According to the American Cancer Society, it is not clear, , whether acrylamide consumption affects people's risk of getting cancer. Health effects A close-up of a raw food dish A raw food diet is likely to impair the development of children and infants. Care is required in planning a raw vegan diet, especially for children, as there may not be enough vitamin B12, vitamin D, and calories for a growing child on a totally raw vegan diet. Food poisoning is a health risk for all people eating raw foods, and increased demand for raw foods is associated with greater incidence of foodborne illness, especially for raw meat, fish, and shellfish. Outbreaks of gastroenteritis among consumers of raw and undercooked animal products (including smoked, pickled or dried animal products) are well- documented, and include raw meat, raw organ meat, raw fish (whether ocean- going or freshwater), shellfish, raw milk and products made from raw milk, and raw eggs. One review stated that \\"Many raw foods are toxic and only become safe after they have been cooked. Some raw foods contain substances that destroy vitamins, interfere with digestive enzymes or damage the walls of the intestine. Raw meat can be contaminated with bacteria which would be destroyed by cooking; raw fish can contain substances that interfere with vitamin B1 (anti-thiaminases)\\"Bender, Arnold E. (1986). Health or Hoax?: The Truth About Health Foods and Diets. Sphere Books. p. 40. Role of cooking in human evolution Richard Wrangham, professor of biological anthropology at Harvard University, proposes that cooked food played a pivotal role in human evolution. Evidence of a cooked diet, according to Wrangham, can be seen as far back as 1.8 million years ago in the anatomical adaptations of Homo erectus. Reduction in the size of teeth and jaw in H. erectus indicate a softer diet, requiring less chewing time. This combined with a smaller gut and larger brain indicate to Wrangham that H. erectus was eating a higher quality diet than its predecessors. To explain a decreased gut providing the amount of energy required for an increased brain size, Wrangham links his research on the digestive effects of cooked versus raw foods with the lower reproductive abilities of female raw foodists, and BMI in both sexes, to support his hypothesis that cooked starches provided the energy necessary to fuel evolution from H. erectus to H. sapiens. Theories opposed to Wrangham's include that of Leslie Aiello, professor of biological anthropology at University College London, and physiologist Peter Wheeler. Aiello and Wheeler believe it was soft animal foods, including bone marrow and brains, which contributed to humans developing the characteristics Wrangham attributes to cooked foods. Further, archaeological evidence suggests that cooking fires began in earnest only around 250 kya, when ancient hearths, earth ovens, burnt animal bones, and flint appear regularly across Europe and the Middle East. Two million years ago, the only sign of fire is burnt earth with human remains, which many anthropologists consider coincidence rather than evidence of intentional fire. Many anthropologists believe the increases in human brain-size occurred well before the advent of cooking, due to a shift away from the consumption of nuts and berries to the consumption of raw meat.

Minor league teams tend to play in smaller, less elaborate venues, often competing in smaller cities/markets. This term is used in North America with regard to several organizations competing in various sports. They generally have lesser fan bases and much smaller revenues and salaries. The minor league concept is a manifestation of the franchise system used in North American sports, whereby the group of major league teams in each sport is fixed for long periods between expansions or other adjustments, which only take place with the consent of the major league owners. In Europe, and many other parts of the world, the football leagues have many divisions below the top-flight as part of the football pyramid. In other parts of the world there is usually either a system of annual promotion and relegation, meaning that clubs have no fixed status in the hierarchy, or there is only one professional league per country in each sport, rendering the major/minor distinction irrelevant.  American football  While there are various semi-professional football leagues, none have any affiliation with the National Football League (NFL). The NFL and its teams have had working relationships with several independent leagues in the past, including the Association of Professional Football Leagues, the Atlantic Coast Football League, and most recently, the league owned-and-operated NFL Europe. In modern times, the NFL has developed players not ready for the active roster through each team's practice squad. Several NFL owners had purchased teams in the Arena Football League in the mid-2000s, prior to its bankruptcy and restructuring. Arena football is played under very different conditions, and the AFL had its own minor league, af2, until 2009. Several other independent indoor football leagues that play a similar game exist. Similarly, the Canadian Football League, though it has developed ties with the NFL in recent years and has moved away from competing with the NFL for talent, plays a visibly different game than the American game, and the two sports favor different types of skills; the CFL arguably holds major league status in its home territory of Canada. Several minor or developmental leagues, independent of the NFL, have come and gone. Some, such as the Alliance of American Football and Fall Experimental Football League (along with the FXFL's successor, the still extant but non-paying The Spring League), have explicit minor league and developmental aspirations. Others, such as the United Football League and both the 2001 and 2020 incarnations of the XFL, have sought to maintain independence and maintain a national profile while acknowledging the lack of funds (particularly from television, which is by far the NFL's largest revenue stream) that would be needed to compete for NFL- caliber talent. The UFL during its existence was recognized and accepted as the second tier of professional football behind the NFL, with several former NFL stars playing in the UFL near the ends of their careers.  Association football (soccer)  Below Major League Soccer several lower-level leagues operate on both sides of the U.S.‚ÄìCanada border as part of the American and Canadian soccer pyramids. As is standard for sports in both countries, the formal promotion and relegation system is not used, although teams have been informally \\"promoted\\" from lower leagues up to Major League Soccer. As of the current 2020 U.S.‚ÄìCanada soccer season, the second level is the USL Championship (USLC; previously the United Soccer League, or USL). The North American Soccer League had previously been the second level, sharing that status with the USL in 2017, but major instability in the NASL led to the loss of that league's second-division status and ultimately its demise. The USL Championship's parent organization, known as the United Soccer League (originally \\"Leagues\\"), also operates USL League Two (formerly the Premier Development League, or PDL), a semi-professional league that has some age restrictions. The National Premier Soccer League operates at approximately the same level as USL League Two. In the spring of 2019, the USL organization launched USL League One (USL 1), which is sanctioned as a third-level professional league, and another third-level circuit, the National Independent Soccer Association, also began play in 2019. In 2013 Major League Soccer announced a partnership with the USL organization which began formal affiliation between some USL teams and MLS teams. The partnership has continued to deepen; most MLS teams now field their own reserve teams in the USLC, while a few have their reserve sides in USL 1 instead of the USLC. MLS now nominally requires all of its teams to either field a reserve team in the USL or officially affiliate with a separately owned USL team (though this has yet to be strictly enforced). No formal relationship existed between NASL and the other leagues; NASL's commissioner had said he believed it would \\"stay that way for some time\\".  Baseball  Minor league baseball is almost as old as the professional game itself, and at first consisted of attempts to play baseball in smaller cities and towns independent of the National League, the first true major league. Soon, scouts for the National League were traveling to watch minor league teams play and attempting to sign the more talented ones away. Soon Major League Baseball began formal developmental agreements with some minor league teams, while others remained independent. Since it was first developed in the 1920s by St. Louis Cardinals executive Branch Rickey, the formal developmental affiliations have come to dominate minor league baseball, and the majority of minor leagues are part of the affiliated system. A general decline in minor league attendance occurred following the advent of television; minor league clubs only survived in many markets because their major league affiliations included financial support. The trend began to reverse in the 1990s, as new independent minor leagues began for the first time in decades and have become successful to varying levels.  Basketball  The National Basketball Association has affiliated minor leagues: the NBA G League (formerly called the \\"NBA D-League\\") and NBA Summer League. The now- defunct Continental Basketball Association (CBA) served some of the purposes of a minor league for the NBA for many years. However, there were no direct developmental agreements between CBA and NBA teams the way that there are between Major League Baseball and National Hockey League teams and their minor league affiliates.  Ice hockey  The sport with the next most extensive system of minor league teams other than baseball is ice hockey. In North America, between 1988 and 2005, 233 minor ice hockey teams played in a total of 160 cities in 13 minor professional leagues. The vast majority of these teams played in the United States, with only 21 of these teams based in Canadian cities. 123 of these minor professional teams played in the southern United States. One reason given for the large number of American-based teams is that minor league franchises will frequently move from city to city, and even between leagues. In contrast, Canadian cities more commonly host major junior teams, which develop teenage prospects prior to their move to the professional leagues. The American Hockey League is the most prominent of the minor hockey leagues in North America.

On \\"the farm\\", the NHL team will develop young players, occasionally rehabilitate older players who are injured or whose quality of play has slumped. These teams, in turn, have lower-level minor leagues to draw players from and pass players down to. Minor professional ice hockey leagues should not be confused with Junior (amateur players) or Senior (semi-professional to amateur) ice hockey leagues.  Other sports  Other sports organizations considered to be minor leagues are golf's Korn Ferry Tour and Symetra Tour, respectively affiliated with the PGA Tour and LPGA; NASCAR's Xfinity Series, Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series and Whelen All-American Series (and to a lesser extent ARCA and its ARCA Menards Series due to ARCA's buyout by NASCAR in 2018); Monster Jam's Triple Threat Series; Overwatch Contenders; and various other affiliated satellite tours of other individual sports, including the Challengers Tour of Professional Tennis.

The university was named after the progressive Qing Dynasty governor of Taiwan Liu Mingchuan. History Ming Chuan University was founded in 1957 by Dr. Teh-Ming Pao and Dr. Ying-Chao Lee. It was Taiwan's first women's business school. Dr. Teh-Ming Pao, its first president, had the most significant influence on its development. When the government had just moved to Taiwan and the economy was lagging, with an urgent need to nurture business professionals, Dr. Pao founded the school in the interests of national development, at the same time raising awareness of the talents and rights of women and facilitating their contributions to society. She began preparations in Fall 1956 and on March 25, 1957, the Ministry of Education approved its founding. It began operation the following Fall. The original plan called for Ming Chuan to be located in Danshui. However, a descendant of Liu Ming-Chuan, Madam Liu, was having difficulty maintaining Ming Chuan Orphanage that she had established on Zhong-Shan North Road. She found Dr. Pao willing to take over Ming Chuan Orphanage, which was later converted into the school of the same name. In five years following its establishment the school was twice moved and rebuilt, finally being relocated to its present site in the Shihlin District in 1962. Dr. Pao borrowed funds so that construction could be completed all at once. Since MCU began as a commercial college, the original three-year day school consisted of three programs: Banking and Insurance, Accounting and Statistics, and International Trade and Business Administration. In 1960, Secretarial Science was added and Ming Chuan became part of the national junior college joint entrance examination program. The former four departments were formed into an evening program added in 1963. In 1964, the day school added a Commercial Mathematics department and Secretarial Science was added to the evening program. A five- year program for junior high school graduates was established in the same year and grew to an enrollment of 1400. Ming Chuan strives to produce well-rounded students, matching instruction in theory with experience in application, and stressing both the humanities and technology. The Ministry of Education of the ROC promoted Ming Chuan to senior college status on July 16, 1990. After more than 30 years of development, Ming Chuan‚Äôs campus on Mount Fu was full to capacity. In 1967, the school purchased gently sloping ground in Guishan Township (now Guishan District) of Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City). Kinmen Campus In 1995, at the invitation of the Kinmen County Education Advancement Investigation Team, Ming Chuan established a campus in Kinmen, thus becoming a comprehensive university with three campuses. Success at Kinmen led the Ministry of Education to approve MCU's establishment of Matsu Executive Master's Programs to promote higher education in Kinmen and Matsu and further Pao's dream ‚Äúto serve the island residents‚Äù, recognizing the right of all to an education. In 2011, the university began holding an annual International Student Paper Competition sponsored by Taiwan ICDF, and finalist papers are published in the Journal of International Cooperation. With the introduction of ICDF (International Corporation and Development Fund) scholarships, the university has become known for its large international population. Ming Chuan opened its Michigan Campus at Saginaw Valley State University in 2014.Grand Opening of Ming Chuan University‚Äôs Michigan Campus (at SVSU) Educational goals * Excellence: MCU strives to nurture a sense of responsibility and team spirit, as well as excellence in teaching, learning, research, and service. * Professionalism: MCU stresses industry-academia collaboration to reinforce theoretical knowledge with practical competence, providing lifelong learning opportunities and a multi-faceted education. * Internationalization: MCU has created an international learning environment, expanding the worldview of faculty and students. Mascot The university's mascot is a whale named Joy, chosen because of the whale's long lifespan and good social relationships. They are smart, curious, clean, friendly, perform well, and sonar. Whales inhabit the whole world‚Äôs oceans, just as those at MCU strive to be broad-minded and global in their perspective.  Emblem and flag  The university flag, like the flag of Taiwan, is red, white, and blue. The emblem follows the color of the flag, with an ascending eagle and three curved figures from the bottom to the top. The globe figure under the eagle represents internationalism and modernization. The design is meant to encourage young scholars to lift themselves as the eagle does with its mighty wings, to have sharp eyes, to soar high, and to not give up though the journey is long. School anniversary Every year, Ming Chuan University celebrates its birthday/anniversary with a cheerleading competition, after months of preparation by each department. The event is observed by the top staff and special guests. Judges rank the teams and award cash prizes used for the next year's preparations.

As of 2019, the book has sold 8 million copies worldwide. The story has appeared in several adaptations, starting with 1973's Dr. Seuss on the Loose starring Paul Winchell as the voice of both Sam-I-Am and the first- person narrator, Guy-Am-I, and more recently an animated TV series of the same name on Netflix starring the voices of Adam DeVine as Sam and Michael Douglas as Guy. Plot A character named \\"Sam-I-Am\\" pesters an unnamed character to eat a dish of green eggs and ham. However he refuses while responding, ‚ÄúI do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am.‚Äù He continues to repeat similar responses while Sam persistently follows him. Finally, the character accepts Sam‚Äôs offer and samples the green eggs and ham.

Thank you, Sam-I-Am.\\"  Background  Green Eggs and Ham is one of Seuss's \\"Beginner Books\\", written with very simple vocabulary for beginning readers. The vocabulary of the text consists of just 50 words and was the result of a bet between Seuss and Bennett Cerf, Dr. Seuss's publisher, that Seuss (after completing The Cat in the Hat using 236 words) could not complete an entire book without exceeding that limit. The 50 words are: a, am, and, anywhere, are, be, boat, box, car, could, dark, do, eat, eggs, fox, goat, good, green, ham, here, house, I, if, in, let, like, may, me, mouse, not, on, or, rain, Sam, say, see, so, thank, that, the, them, there, they, train, tree, try, will, with, would, you.

He served from 1933 until 1942 as the 45th Governor of New York and represented New York State in the U.S. Senate from 1949 until 1957. Early life and education He was born to a Reform Jewish family in Manhattan, New York City, the son of Babetta (n√©e Newgass) and German-born immigrant Mayer Lehman, one of the three brothers who co-founded Lehman Brothers financial services firm. Herbert's father arrived from Rimpar, Germany, in 1848, settling in Montgomery, Alabama, where he engaged in the slave-era cotton business. As cotton was the most important crop of the Southern United States and global demand led to profitable business, the Lehman brothers became cotton factors, accepting cotton bales from customers as payment for their merchandise.Lehman Brothers.com Cotton trading eventually became the main thrust of their business. In 1867, Mayer and Emanuel moved the company's headquarters to New York City, and helped found the New York Cotton Exchange. He attended The Sachs School, founded by Julius Sachs. In 1895, he graduated from Sachs Collegiate Institute in New York City, and in 1899, he graduated with a B.A. from Williams College. After college, Lehman worked in textile manufacturing, eventually becoming vice-president and treasurer of the J. Spencer Turner Company in Brooklyn. In 1908, he became a partner in the investment banking firm Lehman Brothers of New York City with his brother Arthur and cousin Philip. During World War I, he became a colonel on the U.S. Army general staff. By 1928, when he entered public service, he had withdrawn entirely from business. Politics Lehman became active in politics in 1920 and became chairman of the finance committee of the Democratic Party in 1928 as a reward for having been a strong supporter of Alfred E. Smith. He was elected lieutenant governor of New York in 1928 and 1930 and resigned from Lehman Brothers upon taking office. He then served four terms as Governor of New York, elected in 1932 to replace Franklin D. Roosevelt (who had been running for president), and re-elected in 1934, 1936 and 1938 (when he was elected to New York's first four-year gubernatorial term). Unlike Smith, Lehman was a supporter of Roosevelt's New Deal and implemented a similar program in New York. On December 3, 1942, he resigned the governorship less than a month before the end of his term, to accept an appointment as director of foreign relief and rehabilitation operations for the US Department of State. He served as director-general of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration from 1943 to 1946. Lehman was the Democratic nominee for US Senator from New York in 1946 and also ran on the Liberal and American Labor tickets but was defeated by the Republican candidate, Irving Ives. In 1949, he ran again, this time in a special election to serve the remainder of Robert F. Wagner's term. Lehman defeated John Foster Dulles, who had been appointed to temporarily fill the vacancy after Wagner's resignation, and he took his seat on January 3, 1950.Congress History, 81st U.S. Congress On October 17, 1950, New York State Supreme Court Judge Ferdinand Pecora and Senator Lehman (D-NY) gave radio addresses on behalf of the CIO-PAC during prime (10:30-11:15 P.M.). In the campaign, he ran on the Democratic and Liberal tickets, with the American Labor Party urging their members not to vote for any candidate. In 1950, Lehman was re-elected to a full term, running on Democratic and Liberal lines and opposed by the American Labor Party. Lehman was one of two US senators who were opposed to nominating Mississippi Senator James O. Eastland to be chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. (The other was Wayne Morse of Oregon.) He was also an early and vocal opponent of Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.). Lehman was one of the most liberal senators and was therefore not considered part of the Senate's \\"club\\" of insiders. He retired from the Senate after his full term and was not a candidate for renomination in 1956. In October 1941, Lillian Hellman and Ernest Hemingway co-hosted a dinner to raise money for anti-Nazi activists imprisoned in France. New York Governor Herbert Lehman agreed to participate, but withdrew because some of the sponsoring organizations, he wrote, \\"have long been connected with Communist activities.\\" Hellman replied: \\"I do not and I did not ask the politics of any members of the committee and there is nobody who can with honesty vouch for anybody but themselves.\\" She assured him the funds raised would be used as promised and later provided him with a detailed accounting. The next month she wrote him: \\"I am sure it will make you sad and ashamed as it did me to know that, of the seven resignations out of 147 sponsors, five were Jews. Of all the peoples in the world, I think, we should be the last to hold back help, on any grounds, from those who fought for us.\\" Retirement After his retirement from the Senate, Lehman remained politically active, working with Eleanor Roosevelt and Thomas K. Finletter in the late 1950s and early 1960s to support the reform Democratic movement in Manhattan that eventually defeated longtime Tammany Hall boss Carmine DeSapio. He also helped to found the Lehman Children's Zoo (now the Tisch Zoo) in Central Park. Lehman was the first, and until the 2007 inauguration of Eliot Spitzer, the only Jewish governor of New York. During much of his Senate career, he was the only Jewish Senator as well. Unlike most of his Jewish constituents, who had immigrated to the US from eastern Europe, Lehman's family was from Germany. Lehman spent much of the last two years of his life at his New York City home. He celebrated his 85th birthday in March 1963 in increasingly poor health and died of heart failure on December 5, 1963, at age 85. Lehman is interred at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. The gravesite of Herbert H. Lehman Personal life On April 28, 1910, Lehman married Edith Louise Altschul (sister of banker Frank Altschul). The couple had three children: Hilda (1921), Peter (1917), and John. Hilda, Peter and John served in the United States military during World War II; Peter was killed while on active duty. According to a group history published April 6, 1944, the governor's son was to be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The medal was set to be awarded to Peter on his father's 70th birthday.HQ 4th Fighter Group, AAD STA F-356, AF Historical Archives Peter married and had two daughters: Penny Lehman (1940) and Wendy Lehman (1942).Columbia University Digital Archive: \\"1st Lieutenant Peter Gerald Lehman\\" February 15, 1953 His daughter Hilda married thrice. In 1940, Hilda married WPA actor Boris De Vadetzky, of French Russian descent; they later divorced. In 1945, she married U.S. Army Major Eugene L. Paul; they later divorced. She married a third time which also ended in divorce. She had three children: Deborah Wise (1947), Peter Wise (1949) and Stephanie Wise (1951).

Conversion of Reccared to Catholicism by Antonio Mu√±oz Degrain (1888) Reccared I (or Recared; ; ; 559 ‚Äì December 601 AD; reigned 586‚Äì601) was Visigothic King of Hispania and Septimania. His reign marked a climactic shift in history, with the king's renunciation of Arianism in favour of Catholicism in 587. Reign Reccared was the younger son of King Leovigild by his first wife Theodosia. Like his father, Reccared had his capital at Toledo. The Visigothic kings and nobles were traditionally Arian Christians, while the Hispano-Roman population were Roman Catholics. The Catholic bishop Leander of Seville was instrumental in converting the elder son and heir of Leovigild, Hermenegild, to Catholicism. Leander supported his rebellion and was exiled for his role. When King Leovigild died, within a few weeks of April 21, 586, bishop Leander was swift to return to Toledo. The new king had been associated with his father in ruling the kingdom and was acclaimed king by the Visigothic nobles without opposition. In January 587, Reccared renounced Arianism for Catholicism, the single great event of his reign and the turning point for Visigothic Hispania. Most Arian nobles and ecclesiastics followed his example, certainly those around him at Toledo, but there were Arian uprisings, notably in Septimania, his northernmost province, beyond the Pyrenees, where the leader of opposition was the Arian bishop Athaloc, who had the reputation among his Catholic enemies of being virtually a second Arius. Among the secular leaders of the Septimanian insurrection, the counts Granista and Wildigern appealed to Guntram of Burgundy, who saw his opportunity and sent his dux Desiderius. Reccared's army defeated the Arian insurgents and their Catholic allies with great slaughter, Desiderius himself being slain.John of Biclaro, Chronicle, 91. Translated in Kenneth Baxter Wolf, Conquerors and Chroniclers of Early Medieval Spain, second edition (Liverpool: University Press, 1990), p. 74 The next conspiracy broke out in the west, Lusitania, headed by Sunna, the Arian bishop of M√©rida, and count Seggo. Claudius, Reccared's dux Lusitaniae, put down the rising, Sunna being banished to Mauritania and Seggo retiring to Gallaecia.Isidore of Seville, Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum, chapter 54. Translation by Guido Donini and Gordon B. Ford, Isidore of Seville's History of the Goths, Vandals, and Suevi, second revised edition (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1970), p. 25 In the later part of 588 a third conspiracy was headed by the Arian bishop Uldila and the queen dowager Goiswintha, but they were detected, and the bishop was banished.John of Biclaro, Chronicle, 90; translated by Wolf, pp. 73f Imaginary portrait of Reccared I by Di√≥scoro Puebla. Oil on canvas (1857) The Third Council of Toledo, organized by St. Leander but convened in the king's name in May 589, set the tone for the new Catholic kingdom. The public confession of the king, read aloud by a notary, reveals by the emphatic clarity of its theological points and its quotations of scripture that it was ghost-written for the king. Bishop Leander also delivered the triumphant closing sermon, which his brother Isidore entitled Homilia de triumpho ecclesiae ob conversionem Gothorum a homily upon the \\"triumph of the Church upon the conversion of the Goths\\". The text of the homily survives. Leander and the Catholic bishops immediately instituted the program of forced conversion of Jews and extirpation of the remains of Arianism as heresy. Catholic history traditionally imputes these persecutions to the Visigothic kings. When, after Reccared's reign, at a synod held at Toledo in 633, the bishops took upon themselves the nobles' right to select a king from among the royal family, the transfer of power was complete. By this time the remaining ethnic distinction between the increasingly Romanized Visigoths and their Hispano-Roman subjects had all but disappeared (the Gothic language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language with the extirpation of Arianism, and dress and funerary customs also cease to be distinguishing features in ca. 570/580)Strategies of Distinction: Construction of Ethnic Communities, 300-800 (Transformation of the Roman World) by Walter Pohl, (p.119-120: dress and funerary customs cease to be distinguishing features in 570/580) Reportedly Reccared engaged in a vigorous policy against the Jews, pursuing zealous and fanaticalAloysius Ziegler, Church and State in Visigothic Spain (Washington) 1930: \\"Ziegler unhesitatingly characterizes the kings. as 'fanatically zealous'\\" (Bacharach 1973:11. policies limiting Jewish freedoms as promulgated in the canons of synods. Modern historiansNotably Bernard S. Bachrach , in Early Medieval Jewish Policy in Western Europe (University of Minnesota Press) 1977; see also Bacharach, \\"A Reassessment of Visigothic Jewish Policy, 589-711\\", The American Historical Review 78.1 (February 1973), pp. 11-34. have revised this view and see a continuation of traditional Visigothic tolerance. Pope Gregory I was convinced that Reccared refused bribes from the Jewish community, which was large, well-connected throughout the Mediterranean and powerful,Solomon Katz, The Jews in the Visigothic and Frankish Kingdoms of Gaul and Spain (Harvard University Press) 1937 gives the broad background. and Reccared's laws provided that the offspring of a Christian and a Jew be baptised, which was of little moment to the Jewish community, as whether it was not born of a Jewish mother or was born of a Jewish woman outside her community, the child was not considered a Jew anyway. Reccared eliminated the death penalty for Jews convicted of proselytising among Christians and ignored Gregory's request that the trade in Christian slaves at Narbonne be forbidden to Jews.Bacharach, \\"A Reassessment\\", p. 15. Among the canons of five synods during Reccared's reign, E. A. Thompson could find none disadvantaging the Jewish community.Thompson, The Goths in Spain (Oxford University Press) 1969:112. The information for the rest of Reccared's reign is scanty. John of Biclaro, Reccared's contemporary, ends his account with the Third Council of Toledo. Isidore of Seville, bishop Leander's brother, praises his peaceful government, clemency, and generosity: standard encomia. He returned various properties, even some private ones, that had been confiscated by his father, and founded many churches and monasteries. Pope Gregory, writing to Reccared in August 599 (Epp. ix. 61, 121), extols him for embracing the true faith and inducing his people to do so, and notably for refusing the bribes offered by Jews to procure the repeal of a law against them. He sent Reccared a piece of the True Cross, some fragments of the chains of St. Peter, and some hairs of St. John the Baptist. Reccared died a natural death at ToledoAnn Christys, Christians in Al-Andalus, 711-1000, page 37 (Curzon Press, 2002). and was succeeded by his youthful son Liuva II.

Life Nathan Miller was born on October 10, 1868, the son of Samuel Miller, a tenant farmer, and Almira Russell Miller. He attended Groton Union School, and graduated from Cortland Normal School in 1887. He studied law in Cortland, New York, and was admitted to the bar in 1893. Career Miller entered politics as a Republican, and started his political career in Cortland as corporation counsel. He later moved to corporate law, and his rise in politics was strongly helped by his relationship with Andrew Carnegie and the United States Steel Corporation. Miller helped to effect the mergers that created this early mega-corporation. The merger helped Carnegie get out of the steel business and make him one of the richest men in the world at the time. Miller was New York State Comptroller from 1901 to 1903, first appointed to fill the unexpired term of Erastus C. Knight who had been elected Mayor of Buffalo, and in November 1902 elected to a full term. He resigned the comptrollership in 1903, and was appointed to the New York Supreme Court, where he served from 1903 to 1915. In 1904, he was designated to the Appellate Division. On January 13, 1913, he was designated an associate judge of the New York Court of Appeals under the amendment of 1899, but resigned from the bench on July 30, 1915. He served as President of the New York State Bar Association in 1920. He nominated Herbert Hoover for president at the 1920 Republican National Convention. Governor of New York Miller was Governor of New York from 1921 to 1922, elected in 1920. As governor he instituted numerous economy measures, and he estimated that he had saved taxpayers $20 million. Against opposition from New York City Mayor John F. Hylan, Miller fashioned the law creating the New York City Transit Commission. He found the death penalty necessary, and was against its abolition. In 1922, he was defeated in a bid for re-election by his predecessor Al Smith, whom he had unseated in 1920. Miller was a strong supporter of the Roman Catholic Church, his wife's religion, and converted to Catholicism on his deathbed. Later career From 1925 on he served as general counsel for U.S. Steel. He, like his old adversary Smith was active in the American Liberty League, a bipartisan anti- New Deal group founded by wealthy conservatives. While Miller was still the leading partner at his law firm in 1938, Carnegie's Pittsburgh Steamship Company named a ship \\"Governor Miller\\" in his honor. Personal life On November 23, 1896, he married Elizabeth Davern, and they had seven daughters. They resided at the Elmcroft Estate in Upper Brookville, New York. Miller died in 1953 at his New York hotel residence after fracturing his hip following a vacation in Arizona. He was buried in Cortland at the historic Cortland Rural Cemetery.

During 1980, the Brazilian government announced that they intended to participate in the program in order to provide a replacement for the Aermacchi MB-326.

An agreement was also struck to divide AMX manufacturing between the partners; for each production aircraft, Aeritalia manufactured 46.5 per cent of the components (central fuselage, stabilisers and rudders), Aermacchi produced 22.8 per cent (front fuselage and tail cone), and Embraer performed 29.7 per cent of the work (wing, air intakes, pylons and drop tanks). There was no duplication of work, each component of the aircraft was built at one source only. The planned requirements were 187 aircraft for Italy and 100 for Brazil.Warwick 1981, p. 1544. Mendoza, Argentina, 2005 In the early stages of development, various different powerplants and engine configurations were studied to power the type; both twin-engine and single-engine approaches were considered. The use of US-sourced engines had been promptly discounted to avoid any potential restrictions on export sales of the overall aircraft. Amongst the engines examined were the Turbo-Union RB199 (as used by the larger Panavia Tornado), the Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour, Rolls-Royce Viper, and the Rolls-Royce Spey engine. In 1978, the Spey 807 model, which featured several additional improvements, was selected to power the new aircraft. Key features that were reportedly emphasised in the design process of the new aircraft were accessibility and survivability; the AMX had to be able to sustain a single failure to any onboard system without any performance degradation. To achieve this, key systems are duplicated and vital systems are protected; the use of cockpit armor was considered but ultimately discounted due to the expense involved. The detailed definition phase of the project was completed in March 1980. A total of seven flight-capable prototypes were produced for the test program, three by Aeritalia, two by Aermacchi, and two by Embraer, as well as two static airframes. The first prototype, assembled in Italy, made its maiden flight on 15 May 1984. This first aircraft was lost on its fifth flight in an accident, resulting in the death of its pilot.Braybrook 1989, p. 275. Aside from this early loss, testing progressed smoothly and without further incident.Meitus 1992, pp. 223‚Äì224. The first Brazilian-assembled prototype made its first flight on 16 October 1985. On 11 May 1988, the first production aircraft performed its first flight. Deliveries of production aircraft to Italy began in 1988, the first examples were delivered to the Brazilian Air Force during the following year.Lambert 1993, p. 126. On 14 March 1990, the prototype two-seat AMX made its first flight.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 291. Design An AMX performing a display at the 2008 Royal International Air Tattoo The AMX is a conventional shoulder-winged monoplane. It is composed primarily of aluminium and manufactured using traditional construction methods, however elements such as the tail fin and elevators use carbon fibre composite materials. For its size, a large proportion of the AMX's internal space is allocated to avionics and onboard computer systems, both the navigation and attack systems are computerized.Warwick 1981, p. 1545. For accessibly and ease of maintenance, all avionics are installed directly in bays beneath the cockpit in a manner in which they can be worked upon at ground level without the use of support platforms. Drawing on experience from the Panavia Tornado, the AMX is equipped with a hybrid flight control system; a fly-by-wire control system is employed to operate flight control surfaces such as the spoilers, rudder and variable incidence tailplane, while the ailerons and elevators are actuated via a dual-redundant hydraulic system. Manual reversion is provided for the ailerons, elevator and rudder to allow the aircraft to be flown even in the event of complete hydraulic failure; either control system can act independent of one another.Warwick 1981, pp. 1544‚Äì1545. The wing is fitted with both leading edge slats and trailing edge flaps and overwing spoilers ahead of the flaps. The spoilers can function as airbrakes and to negate lift; improving take-off and landing performance as well as manoeuvrability during flight. A single Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engine serves as the AMX's powerplant. During the aircraft's development, the Spey was heavier and less modern than some of the available alternatives, but it was considered to be reliable, relatively cheap and was free of export restrictions that would be imposed by using American engines.Braybrook 1989, p. 270. The Spey engine also enabled for the use of a simplified round-lipped inlet design. The rear fuselage is detachable in order to gain access to the engine. Separate consortia in both Brazil and Italy manufactured the Spey for the AMX. Unusual for a strike aircraft of the era, no attempt was made to develop the aircraft to fly at supersonic speeds. An AMX and several munitions on display at the Paris Air Show, 1989 Brazilian and Italian aircraft differ considerably in their avionics, Italian aircraft being equipped with various NATO systems which were considered redundant in the South American theatre. AMXs in Brazilian service are often fitted with one of three pallet-mounted sensor packages, which contain various vertical, oblique, and forward-facing cameras, for performing the aircraft's secondary aerial reconnaissance role. A simple ranging radar is equipped for targeting purposes, however the specific radar also differs between both operators.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 290. The flight system employs a GE Avionics flight control computer.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 289‚Äì290. Extensive electronic countermeasure (ECM) are fitted to protect the aircraft, include passive receiver antenna on the tailfin and an active jammer pod that is typically mounted on one of the aircraft's hardpoints. Various munitions could be mounted on the one centerline and four under-wing hardpoints, including bombs, missiles and rockets; payloads of up to 2,000 lb may be carried upon the centerline and the two innermost under-wing pylons, while the outer pylons can carry up to 1,000 lb. All four of the under-wing hardpoints are plumbed for drop tanks to extend the aircraft's range, Italian aircraft are also fitted with a fixed aerial refueling probe. Optical reconnaissance pods can be carried externally on the centerline hardpoint. Wingtip rails are provided for infrared guided air-to- air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder and MAA-1 Piranha. Italian aircraft are fitted with a M61 Vulcan 20 mm rotary cannon on the port side of the lower fuselage. The United States denied the sale of the M61 to Brazil, thus its AMXs are instead fitted with two 30 mm DEFA 554 revolver cannons.Jackson 1991, p. 135. Operational history Takeoff of Brazilian's fighter bombers AMX A-1 The first operational squadron of the Italian air force, the 103¬∞ Gruppo of 51¬∞ Stormo formed in November 1989,Nicolli 1997, p. 351. with the first Italian unit also forming in 1989.Jackson 1991, p. 138. Both the Italian and Brazilian AMX fleets were grounded in February 1992, following the crash of an Italian AMX due to engine failure. Operations were allowed to restart in May that year, following modification of the engines.Nicolli 1997, pp. 351‚Äì352. \\"Brazil and Italy lift AMX Ban\\" . Flight International, 6‚Äì12 May 1992, p. 14. Italy assigned six AMXs from 103¬∞ Gruppo to operations over Bosnia in 1995 as part of Operation Deny Flight, which was followed by a similar deployment in support of the IFOR peacekeepers in Bosnia. This deployment was interrupted by another grounding, again due to engine failure, between January and March 1996.Nicolli 1997, p. 352. Italian AMX aircraft were used in 1999 in the Kosovo war. Instead of using unguided or more traditional laser-guided bombs, the Italian Air Force used dozens of Mk 82 bombs fitted with Opher Israeli guidance kits, effectively converting the \\"dumb\\" bombs into an infrared-guided bomb. In the late 1990s, AMX International was considering a major engine refit; a non-afterburning variant of the Eurojet EJ200 was proposed, with considerably more thrust than the existing powerplant.Norris, Guy. \\"EJ200 engine proposed for AMX.\\" Flight International, 20 April 1999. In 2005, the Italian Air Force launched an upgrade programme (ACOL Aggionamento Capacit√† Operative e Logistiche ‚Äì Operational and Logistical Capability Upgrade) for 55 of its AMXs, adding a new laser INS, new cockpit displays and allowing the aircraft to drop Joint Direct Attack Munition guided bombs.Niccoli 2009, p.44. In August 2007, Embraer began a major midlife upgrade programme and modernisation of 53 Brazilian Air Force AMX A-1s, focusing on avionics systems and new armament additions; the programme is estimated to have extended the lifespan of the fleet beyond 2027.Gething, Michael J. \\"Embraer commences AMX modifications for the Brazilian Air Force.\\" Jane's, 9 June 2007. Italian Air Force AMX, 2010 Starting in November 2009, four Italian AMXs were deployed overseas for operations in Afghanistan, replacing the same number of Italian Tornado IDS in the reconnaissance role.Peruzzi, Luca. \\"Italy's JATF in Afghanistan boosts air-to-ground and C-IED capabilities.\\" Jane's, 9 November 2012. Of particular note is the aircraft's ability to share digital electro- optical and infrared sensor information with ground troops in real time, providing valuable reconnaissance information and helping to minimise threat exposure. By the end of 2010 over 700 combat missions had been flown in the Afghan theatre. On 28 May 2014, the AMX performed its last combat sortie in the Afghan theatre, and on 20 June 2014, all remaining AMXs were withdrawn from Afghanistan. \\"Italian Air Force: a year of missions for the AMX airplanes in Afghanistan.\\" AvioNews, 3 December 2010. In 2011, Italian AMX aircraft were employed during the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Italian military aircraft deployed 710 guided bombs and missiles during sorties: Italian Air Force Tornados and AMX fighter bombers deployed 550 bombs and missiles, while Navy AV-8Bs deployed 160 guided bombs. The conflict saw the first use by AMX aircraft of Litening targeting pods paired with Paveway and JDAM guided bombs. In early 2016, due to the declining stability of Libya, Italy opted to station additional aircraft, including four AMX fighters, at Bassi Airbase, Trapani, Sicily.\\"Italy Sends Fighter Aircraft to Birgi Base Amid Concerns Over Libya.\\" Sputnik News, 16 January 2016. In March 2012, the Philippines were reportedly holding negotiations with Italy for the possible procurement of used AMX aircraft; however, on 28 March 2014, the Philippines' Department of National Defense signed a contract for 12 FA-50 light attack aircraft worth P18.9 billion (US$421.12 million). Variants Italian AMX at RAF Fairford, England, 1998 ;AMX-T In 1986, development of a two-seat advanced trainer variant was undertaken. This was intended to provide trainee pilots with experience on fast jets, while still retaining the single-seater's attack capabilities. First flying in 1990, the AMX-T equipped both the Italian and Brazilian air forces. ;AMX-ATA The AMX Advanced Trainer Attack (AMX-ATA) is a new AMX two-seater multi-mission attack fighter developed for combat roles and advanced training. The AMX-ATA incorporates new sensors, a forward-looking infrared helmet-mounted display, a new multi-mode radar for air-to-air and air-to-surface capability, and new weapons systems including anti-ship missiles and medium-range missiles. The Venezuelan Air Force ordered eight AMX-ATA in 1999 for the advanced trainer and attack aircraft role, but the US Congress vetoed the sale because the aircraft systems include US technology.Spinelli, Andrea. \\"Venezuela selects MB339FD and AMX ATA combination.\\" Flight International, 15 July 1998.\\"Military Aircraft Directory: AMX.\\" Flight International, 29 July 1998. ;AMX-R (RA-1) An AMX variant designed for reconnaissance missions.

Located in the Las Vegas Arts district at 1027 S Main st. #110, BHOF is a tourist destination and non-profit 501 (c)(3) educational organization offering tours of its vast Collection of costumes, memorabilia, props and ephemera from burlesque's heyday through contemporary practice; classes for individuals and groups at all levels including beginner; movie screenings; research access for students and journalists; and a gift shop. Formerly known as Exotic World, the museum began as the personal collection of striptease artist and founding member of The Exotic Dancers' League of America Jennie Lee. After her death in 1990, her friend and fellow entertainer, Dixie Evans, created the museum in Helendale, California, and launched the \\"Miss Exotic World\\" Competition in 1990. In 2006, The Burlesque Hall of Fame relocated from Helendale to Las Vegas, NV, to establish itself as a permanent tourist attraction and exhibition space for its collection. After nearly a decade in the Emergency Arts building in the heart of a revitalized Downtown Las Vegas, the museum moved to Las Vegas' Arts district in 2018. This Miss Exotic World competition is in its 29th year (as of 2019), and has grown to become The Burlesque Hall of Fame Weekender, a four-day convention held annually in Las Vegas that includes class, vending, museum tours, pin-up safaris, and four nights of showcases: Movers, Shakers, and Innovators; The Titans of Tease Reunion (now in its 68th year); The Miss Exotic World Competition; and Icons and All-Stars. History Retired dancer Jennie Lee started collecting burlesque memorabilia when she owned the Sassy Lassy nightclub in San Pedro, California. After Lee was diagnosed with breast cancer, she and her husband moved to an abandoned goat farm in Helendale, California, located in the Mojave Desert about one third of the way between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. Lee intended to create a burlesque museum, found a burlesque school and run a bed and breakfast, and the goat farm site had enough room to contain her growing collection. Only the museum got started within her lifetime. After Lee died in 1990, Dixie Evans took over the farm and turned it into The Exotic World Burlesque Museum, aided by Lee's widower, Charlie Arroyo. Lee's memorabilia formed the core of the collection, but people from around the world soon started to donate items to Exotic World. The collection grew large enough to fill the entire farm. In late 2005, the museum was temporarily closed for inventory and renovations in the wake of Arroyo's unexpected death and significant weather damage to the museum facilities. Although the museum was not open at the time of the annual Miss Exotic World Pageant in 2006, the pageant was nevertheless held at an alternate venue, the Celebrity Theater in Las Vegas. In 2006, the Burlesque Hall of Fame relocated from Helendale to a temporary space in The Las Vegas Emergency Arts building. The Hall of Fame relocated to a permanent premises in S Main Street, Las Vegas in April 2018. Legends of Burlesque The Burlesque Hall of Fame does not have a formal induction process. The museum is dedicated to celebrating and honoring the entire history of burlesque. A \\"Living Legend of the Year\\" award is presented annually during the BHOF Weekender to a performer who has made a significant contribution to burlesque history. BHOF also presents a \\"Sassy Lassy\\" award to a person who has contributed significantly to the promotion and preservation of the art of burlesque.

The museum includes costume elements and props such as feather boas, fans, gloves, garter belts, gowns, shoes, pasties, g-strings, and jewelry. Many of these items are specially made for use in striptease routines. Unique individual items include ivory fans used by Sally Rand, gloves and a black velvet shoulder cape worn by Gypsy Rose Lee, a heart-shaped couch owned by Jayne Mansfield and the cremation ashes of Miss Sheri Champagne. Film The history of the Burlesque Hall of Fame is the featured subject of the 2010 documentary Exotic World & the Burlesque Revival.Exotic World & the Burlesque Revival Dixie Evans appears in Leslie Zemeckis' documentary Behind the Burly Q. Miss Exotic World Pageant Michelle L'amour performing fan dance at Miss Exotic World Pageant (2007) Exotic World hosts the annual Miss Exotic World pageant on the first Saturday of every June. Each year a Neo-burlesque performer is crowned Miss Exotic World in a contest often referred to as the Miss America of burlesque. Winners receive both the title and a trophy. Evolving from annual celebrations for the Exotic Dancers League union, Dixie Evans initiated the Miss Exotic World pageant in 1990 as a way to draw people to the museum. She garnered attention by sending out a press release claiming that \\"Lili St. Cyr, Tempest Storm, Blaze Starr and 30 other alumni of burlesque will all be invited to attend this reunion.\\" While technically true, none of those invitees attended that year. However, the release garnered press attention for the pageant, which was successful enough to become an annual event. Each contest features burlesque performances by both stars from burlesque's golden age and younger women involved in the New Burlesque scene.

It is a hardware virtualization technique that allowed multiple 8086 processors to be emulated by the 386 chip; it emerged from the painful experiences with the 80286 protected mode, which by itself was not suitable to run concurrent real mode applications well. VM86 mode uses a segmentation scheme identical to that of real mode (for compatibility reasons) which creates 20-bit linear addresses in the same manner as 20-bit physical addresses are created in real mode, but are subject to protected mode's memory paging mechanism. Overview The virtual 8086 mode is a mode for a protected-mode task. Consequently, the processor can switch between VM86 and non-VM86 tasks, enabling multitasking legacy (DOS) applications. To use virtual 8086 mode, an operating system sets up a virtual 8086 mode monitor, which is a program that manages the real-mode program and emulates or filters access to system hardware and software resources. The monitor must run at privilege level 0 and in protected mode. Only the 8086 program runs in VM86 mode and at privilege level 3. When the real-mode program attempts to do things like access certain I/O ports to use hardware devices or access certain regions in its memory space, the CPU traps these events and calls the V86 monitor, which examines what the real mode program is trying to do and either acts as a proxy to interface with the hardware, emulates the intended function the real-mode program was trying to access, or terminates the real-mode program if it is trying to do something that cannot either be allowed or be adequately supported (such as reboot the machine, set a video display into a mode that is not supported by the hardware and is not emulated, or write over operating system code). The V86 monitor can also deny permission gently by emulating the failure of a requested operation--for example, it can make a disk drive always appear not ready when in fact it has not even checked the drive but simply will not permit the real-mode program to access it. Also, the V86 monitor can do things like map memory pages, intercept calls and interrupts, and preempt the real-mode program, allowing real-mode programs to be multitasked like protected-mode programs. By intercepting the hardware and software I/O of the real-mode program and tracking the state that the V86 program expects, it can allow multiple programs to share the same hardware without interfering with each other. So V86 mode provides a way for real-mode programs designed for a single-tasking environment (like DOS) to run concurrently in a multitasking environment. Usage It is used to execute certain DOS programs in FlexOS 386 (since 1987), Concurrent DOS 386 (since 1987), Windows/386 2.10 (since 1987), DESQview 386 (since 1988), Windows 3.x (since 1990), Multiuser DOS (since 1991), Windows for Workgroups 3.1x (since 1992), OS/2 2.x (since 1992), 4690 OS (since 1993), REAL/32 (since 1995) running in 386 Enhanced Mode as well as in Windows 95, 98, 98 SE and ME through virtual DOS machines, in SCO UNIX through Merge, and in Linux through DOSEMU. (Other DOS programs which use protected mode execute using user mode under the emulator.) NTVDM in x86 Windows NT-based operating systems also use VM86 mode, but with very limited direct hardware access. Memory addressing and interrupts The most common problem by running 8086 code from protected mode is memory addressing which is totally different between protected mode and real mode. As mentioned, by working under VM86 mode the segmentation mechanism is reconfigured to work just like under real mode, but the paging mechanism is still active, and it is transparent to the real mode code; thus, memory protection is still applicable, and so is the isolation of the address space. When interrupts (hardware, software and int instruction) occur, the processor switches off the VM86 mode and returns to work in full protected mode to handle the interrupt. Also, before servicing the interrupt, the DS, ES, FS, and GS registers are pushed on the new stack and zeroed. Virtual-8086 mode extensions (VME) The Pentium architecture added a number of enhancements to the virtual 8086 mode. These were however documented by Intel only starting with the subsequent P6 (microarchitecture); their more recent formal name is Virtual-8086 Mode Extensions, abbreviated VME (older documentation may use \\"Virtual 8086 mode enhancements\\" as the VME acronym expansion). Some later Intel 486 chips also support it. The enhancements address mainly the 8086 virtualization overhead, with a particular focus on (virtual) interrupts. Before the extensions were publicly documented in the P6 documentation, the official documentation referred to the famed Appendix H, which was omitted from the public documentation and shared only with selected partners under NDA. Activating VME is done by setting bit number 0 (0x1 in value) of CR4. Because the VME interrupt speed-up enhancements were found useful for non-VM86 protected tasks, they can also be enabled separately by setting only bit number 1 (0x2 in value), which is called PVI (Protected Mode Virtual Interrupts). Detecting whether a processor supports VME (including PVI) is done using the CPUID instruction, with an initial EAX value of 0x1, by testing the value of second bit (bit number 1, 0x2 in value) in EDX register, which is set if VME is supported by the processor. In Linux, this latter bit is reported as the \`vme\` flag in the \`/proc/cpuinfo\` file, under the \\"flags\\" section. In virtual 8086 mode, the basic idea is that when IOPL is less than 3, PUSHF/POPF/STI/CLI/INT/IRET instructions will treat the value of VIF in the real 32-bit EFLAGS register as the value of IF in the simulated 16-bit FLAGS register (32-bit PUSHFD/POPFD continues to GP fault). VIP will cause a GP fault on the setting of simulated IF, directing the OS to process any pending interrupts. PVI is the same idea but only affects CLI/STI instructions. First generation AMD Ryzen CPUs have been found to feature a broken VME implementation. The second generation Ryzen (2000 series) has fixed this issue. 64-bit and VMX support Support for virtual 8086 mode is not available in x86-64 long mode, although it is still present on 64-bit capable processors running in legacy mode. The addition of VT-x has added back the ability to run virtual 8086 mode from x86-64 long mode, but it has to be done by transitioning the (physical) processor to VMX root mode and launching a logical (virtual) processor itself running in virtual 8086 mode.; see also CS 686: Special Topic: Intel EM64T and VT Extensions (Spring 2007), lesson 24 how to do this from Linux (not that the code is pretty dated, so might not work as-is with current kernels) more up-to-date code can be found here. Also beware that this sample code is more complicated than strictly booting the logical processor in virtual 8086 mode; its ultimate goal is make some real- mode BIOS calls. Westmere and later Intel processors usually can start the virtual processor directly in real mode using the \\"unrestricted guest\\" feature (which itself requires Extended Page Tables); this method removes the need to resort to the nested virtual 8086 mode simply to run the legacy BIOS for booting.\\"Intel added unrestricted guest mode on Westmere micro-architecture and later Intel CPUs, it uses EPT to translate guest physical address access to host physical address.

Route The Ashton leaves the Rochdale Canal at Ducie St. Junction in central Manchester, and climbs for through 18 locks, passing through Ancoats, Holt Town, Bradford, Clayton, Openshaw, Droylsden, Fairfield and Audenshaw to make a head-on junction with the Huddersfield Narrow Canal (formerly the Huddersfield Canal) at Whitelands Basin in the centre of Ashton-under-Lyne. At Bradford, the canal passes by the venue of the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Apart from the Rochdale and Huddersfield Narrow canals, the Ashton Canal only currently connects with one other canal. Just short of Whitelands, at Dukinfield Junction/Portland Basin a short arm crosses the river Tame on the Tame Aqueduct, and makes a head-on junction with the Peak Forest Canal. There used to be four other important connections to branch canals: the Islington Branch Canal in Ancoats; the Stockport Branch Canal from Clayton to Stockport (Heaton Norris); the Hollinwood Branch Canal from Fairfield to Hollinwood; and the Fairbottom Branch Canal (itself a branch of the Hollinwood Branch Canal) from Waterhouses to Fairbottom. There was to have been a fifth branch, namely the Beat Bank Branch Canal (itself a branch of Stockport Branch Canal) from Reddish to Beat Bank in Denton, but this was abandoned before completion. Many of the canal locks are now listed buildings. History The canal received its Act of Parliament in 1792. It was built to supply coal from Oldham and Ashton under Lyne to Manchester. The first section between Ancoats Lane to Ashton-under- Lyne and Hollinwood was completed in 1796, followed by the lines to Heaton Norris and Fairbottom in 1797. Although there were plans to link it to the Rochdale Canal, it opened as an isolated waterway. Benjamin Outram was retained to complete the final section between Ancoats Lane and the Rochdale Canal including the Piccadilly Basin. It included the unique Store Street Aqueduct, built on a 45 degree skew and believed to be the first major such structure in Britain and the oldest still in use today. The section was completed by 1798, but the necessary extension by the Rochdale proprietors to the Bridgewater Canal was not built until 1800. Although the Huddersfield Narrow Canal was open as far as Woolroad by 1798, neither it, nor the Peak Forest Canal were complete. In fact it was another ten years before the former connected to Yorkshire and the east coast. With little but local trade in its early years, the canal struggled financially and a dividend was not paid until 1806. It then prospered until competition from railways, and later road transport, greatly diminished traffic, and through traffic had ended by 1945. Traffic on the branches ended in the 1930s. Following nationalisation in 1947‚Äì48, traffic did not revive, and all traffic had ceased by 1958, after which maintenance was run down. By 1961, combined with vandalism, the canal had become unnavigable, and its retention for pleasure use seemed unlikely. The Ashton Canal was one of seven stretches of canal, formerly designated as remainder waterways, that were re-classified by the British Waterways Act of 8 February 1983. Under the act, a total of of canal were upgraded to Cruising Waterway Standard. Leisure use Pressure from the Inland Waterways Association, combined with the formation of the Peak Forest Canal Society, led to a campaign to reopen the Ashton, with the major organised volunteer clearance of the section though Droylsden in September 1968, known as Operation Ashton. Further campaigning, and the growth of local authority support, led to its restoration, along with the adjacent lower Peak Forest Canal, and reopening on 1 April 1974. The restoration of these two canals opened up the Cheshire Ring, an immediately (and still) popular one-week leisure cruise circling much of east Cheshire. With the opening of the Southern Pennine canals, the Ashton is now also part of the South Pennine Ring (Rochdale and Huddersfield Narrow) and the longest Pennine Ring of all (Outer Pennine Ring - Leeds & Liverpool and Huddersfield Narrow). It used to be common to hear reports of unfortunate incidents along the Ashton, such as thefts from boats and intimidating, or at least unnerving, behaviour on the part of some local youths and children. This, for a time, caused boats to go through in convoys. Today the Ashton Canal is increasingly valued by the communities through which it passes, and although many boaters still advise others to cover the Ashton during early hours, and not in school holidays, reports of problems often turn out to be the repeated telling of old stories. However, incidents do still occur, as in August 2014 when a number of boats were attacked by hooded youths. The locks are renowned for debris (shopping trolleys, wheely bins, rocks etc.) which can result in blocked lock gates, but Canal & River Trust workers are soon on site to clear any reported incidents. Portland Basin is a good overnight mooring after ascending the Ashton locks, for those who do not wish to proceed beyond Romiley. There are current campaigns to restore the Hollinwood Branch and Stockport Branches.

Georg Stiernhielm (August 7, 1598 ‚Äì April 22, 1672) was a Swedish civil servant, mathematician, linguist and poet. Life Stiernhielm was born on the family estate Gammelg√•rden in the village Svartsk√§r in Vika parish in Dalarna where his father, Olof Markvardsson, of the noble mining family Stierna, was a miner and bailiff. The surname Stiernhielm, literally \\"Star Helmet\\", was taken in later life when he was raised into the Swedish nobility. He grew up in the Bergslagen region where his father worked with the mining industry. Stiernhielm received his first schooling at V√§ster√•s, but he was also educated in Germany and the Netherlands. In 1636 he obtained the Vasula manor near Tartu, Estonia and lived there until 1656, when he moved due to war with Russia back to Stockholm. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in December 1669. Works He was a pioneer of linguistics, and even if many of his conclusions later proved wrong they were accepted by his contemporaries. Stiernhielm tried to prove that Gothic, which he equated with Old Norse was the origin of all languages, and that the Nordic countries were vagina gentium, the human birthplace. His most famous work is \\"Hercules\\", an epic poem in hexameter, about how Hercules in his youth is being tempted by Fru Lusta (\\"Mrs. Lust\\") and her daughters to choose an immoral lifestyle for his future. The allegory, known as Hercules at the crossroads, can be traced back to the Athenian sophist Prodicus of Ceos, as preserved in Xenophon. Stiernhielm was the first Swedish poet to apply the verse meters of antique poets to the Swedish language, modifying their principle of long and short syllables to a principle of stressed and unstressed syllables, which better suits the phonology of Swedish, using ideas first developed by Martin Opitz and later theoretically applied to Swedish by Andreas Arvidi. This made him known as \\"the father of Swedish poetry\\". His Mus√¶ Suethizantes of 1668 is held to be the first important Swedish book of poetry.

Its heyday began in the 1870s and ended in roughly 1915 when the railroad bypassed Achilles and with more use of the automobile, Achilles declined. Most of the businesses were defunct by the mid- to late-1930s. There was a legendary incident on April 24, 1875 referred to as the \\"battle of Achilles\\" that was a fight between a band of 20 hunters and some Indians at a water hole about five miles south of the village. A post office was opened in Achilles in 1879, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1951. The money order post office was connected by stage at one point with Colby, where it received a daily mail. The population was 70 in 1910, and was a principal trading point in the southwestern part of the county. Over the years business in Achilles supported two general stores, including Hill General Store; a variety store; a blacksmith shop; a barbershop; a mechanics garage; and a creamery. These were lined along Main Street. These buildings are all gone. The blacksmith shop burned in 1922, and the hardware store was moved into Atwood and is used now for an antique shop. Several buildings were either moved or the wood was sold from the buildings. In about 1999 the last skeletal frame of a general store was burned, erasing all signs of Main Street. Now \\"Main Street\\" is part family garden, crop field, weeds, and overgrowth. There were two houses actually in Achilles: Pearl (Hill) and Frank Bacon home and the Fields house. The Fields house remains; the Bacon home was moved. Off of Main Street stood a Methodist church, later moved to Atwood and used for a home. Also off Main Street stood the Achilles one-room schoolhouse, which is still standing and used for community events. Nearby Achilles Cemetery acknowledges many of the pioneers who settled the area. In 1993 Achilles was still marked on Kansas State maps, but by 2001 it was no longer acknowledged on newly published maps.

In 1661, the company chartered the Town of Boswijck, including land that would later become Williamsburg. After the English takeover of New Netherland in 1664, the town's name was anglicized to Bushwick. During colonial times, villagers called the area \\"Bushwick Shore\\", a name that lasted for about 140 years. Bushwick Shore was cut off from the other villages in Bushwick by Bushwick Creek to the north and by Cripplebush, a region of thick, boggy shrub land that extended from Wallabout Creek in the south to Newtown Creek in the east. Bushwick residents called Bushwick Shore \\"the Strand\\".The Site of WILLIAMSBURG. Retrieved October 18, 2006. Farmers and gardeners from the other Bushwick villages sent their goods to Bushwick Shore to be ferried across the East River to New York City for sale via a market at present day Grand Street. Bushwick Shore's favorable location close to New York City led to the creation of several farming developments. In 1802, real estate speculator Richard M. Woodhull acquired 13 acres (53,000 m¬≤) near what would become Metropolitan Avenue, then North 2nd Street. He had Colonel Jonathan Williams, a U.S. Engineer, survey the property, and named it Williamsburgh (with an h at the end) in his honor. Originally a development within Bushwick Shore, Williamsburg rapidly expanded during the first half of the nineteenth century and eventually seceded from Bushwick and formed its own independent city. Incorporation of Williamsburgh Map of the Village of Williamsburgh (1827) Map of the Town of Williamsburgh (1845) Williamsburg was incorporated as the Village of Williamsburgh within the Town of Bushwick in 1827. In two years, it had a fire company, a post office, and a population of over 1,000. The deep drafts along the East River encouraged industrialists, many from Germany, to build shipyards around Williamsburg. Raw material was shipped in, and finished products were sent out of factories straight to the docks. Several sugar barons built processing refineries. Now, all are gone, except the now-defunct Domino Sugar (formerly Havemeyer & Elder). Other important industries included ship-building and brewing. On April 18, 1835, the Village of Williamsburg annexed a portion of the Town of Bushwick. The Village then consisted of three districts. The first district was commonly called the \\"South Side\\", the second district was called the \\"North Side\\", and the third district was called the \\"New Village\\". The names \\"North Side\\" and \\"South Side\\" remain in common usage today, but the name for the Third District has changed often. The New Village became populated by Germans, and for a time was known by the sobriquet of \\"Dutchtown\\". In 1845, the population of Williamsburgh was 11,500.Population given in the legend of \\"A Map of Williamsburg\\", Isaac Vieth, Brooklyn, 1845. Reflecting its increasing urbanization, Williamsburg separated from Bushwick as the Town of Williamsburg in 1840. It became the City of Williamsburg (discarding the \\"h\\") in 1852, which was organized into three wards. The old First Ward roughly coincides with the South Side, and the Second Ward with the North Side, with the modern boundary at Grand Street. The Third Ward was to the east of these, stretching from Union Avenue east to Bushwick Avenue, beyond which is Bushwick (some of which is now called East Williamsburg). Incorporation into the Eastern District Brewers Row, North 11th Street Bedford Avenue and North 8th Street In 1855, the City of Williamsburg, along with the adjoining Town of Bushwick, were annexed into the City of Brooklyn as the so-called Eastern District. The First Ward of Williamsburg became Brooklyn's 13th Ward, the Second Ward Brooklyn's 14th Ward, and the Third Ward Brooklyn's 15th and 16th Wards. During its period as part of Brooklyn's Eastern District, the area achieved remarkable industrial, cultural, and economic growth, and local businesses thrived. Wealthy New Yorkers such as Cornelius Vanderbilt and railroad magnate Jubilee Jim Fisk built shore-side mansions. Charles Pratt and his family founded the Pratt Institute, the great school of art & architecture, and the Astral Oil Works, which later became part of Standard Oil. Corning Glass Works was founded here, before moving upstate to Corning, New York. German immigrant, chemist Charles Pfizer founded Pfizer Pharmaceutical in Williamsburg, and the company maintained an industrial plant in the neighborhood through 2007, although its headquarters were moved to Manhattan in the 1960s. Brooklyn's Broadway, ending in the ferry to Manhattan, became the area's lifeline. The area proved popular for condiment and household product manufacturers. Factories for Domino Sugar, Esquire Shoe Polish, Dutch Mustard, and many others were established in the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of these factory buildings are now being (or already have been) converted to non-industrial uses, primarily residential. The population was at first heavily German, but many Jews from the Lower East side of Manhattan came to the area after the completion of the Williamsburg Bridge in 1903. Williamsburg had two major community banks: the Williamsburgh Savings Bank (chartered 1851, since absorbed by HSBC); and its rival, the Dime Savings Bank of Williamsburgh (chartered 1864, now known as the DIME, has remained independent). The area around the Peter Luger Steak House, established in 1887, in the predominantly German neighborhood under the Williamsburg Bridge, was a major banking hub, until the City of Brooklyn united with New York City.Bernardo, Leonard and Jennifer Weiss.

The intersection of Broadway, Flushing Avenue, and Graham Avenue was a cross-roads for many \\"interurbans\\", prior to World War I. These light rail trolleys ran from Long Island to Williamsburg. Refugees from war-torn Europe began to stream into Brooklyn during and after World War II, including the Hasidim whose populations had been devastated in the Holocaust. The area south of Division Avenue became home to a large population of adherents to the Satmar Hasidic sect who came to the area from Hungary and Romania.Idov, Michael. \\"Clash of the Bearded Ones; Hipsters, Hasids, and the Williamsburg street.\\", New York (magazine), April 11, 2010.

But the population explosion was eventually confronted with a decline of heavy industry, and from the 1960s, Williamsburg saw a marked increase in unemployment, crime, gang activity, and illegal drug use. Those who were able to move out often did, and the area became chiefly known for its crime and other social ills.

Average rents in Williamsburg can range from approximately $1400 for a studio apartment to $1,600‚Äì2,400 for a one-bedroom and $2,600‚Äì4,000 for a two-bedroom. The price of land in Willamsburg has skyrocketed. The North Side, above Grand Street, which separates the North Side from the South Side, is somewhat more expensive due to its proximity to the New York City Subway (specifically, the and on the BMT Canarsie Line and IND Crosstown Line, respectively). More recent gentrification and the route of the M train (whose route was modified to go from the downtown BMT Nassau Street Line to the midtown IND Sixth Avenue Line in 2010), however, have prompted increases in rents south of Grand Street as well. Higher rents have driven out many bohemians and hipsters to other neighborhoods farther afield such as Bushwick, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Cobble Hill, and Red Hook. On May 11, 2005, the New York City Council passed a large-scale rezoning of the North Side and Greenpoint waterfront.Greenpoint-Williamsburg Follow-Up Zoning Text and Map Changes ‚Äì Approved . Retrieved October 21, 2006. Much of the waterfront district was rezoned to accommodate mixed-use high density residential buildings with a set-aside (but no earmarked funding) for public waterfront park space, with strict building guidelines calling for developers to create a continuous two-mile-long string of waterfront esplanades. Local elected officials touted the rezoning as an economically beneficial way to address the decline of manufacturing along the North Brooklyn waterfront, which had resulted in a number of vacant and derelict warehouses in Williamsburg. The Edge and Northside Piers developments on Kent Avenue include some of the many high-rise condominium buildings constructed as a result of the 2005 rezoning. The rezoning represented a dramatic shift of scale in the ongoing process of gentrification in the area since the early 1990s. The waterfront neighborhoods, once characterized by active manufacturing and other light industry interspersed with smaller residential buildings, were re-zoned primarily for residential use. Alongside the construction of new residential buildings, many warehouses were converted into residential loft buildings. Among the first was the Smith-Gray Building, a turn-of-the-century structure recognizable by its blue cast-iron facade. The conversion of the former Gretsch music instrument factory garnered significant attention and controversy in the New York press primarily because it heralded the arrival in Williamsburg of Tribeca-style lofts and attracted, as residents and investors, a number of celebrities. Officials championing the rezoning cited its economic benefits, the new waterfront promenades, and its inclusionary housing component ‚Äì which offered developers large tax breaks in exchange for promises to rent about a third of the new housing units at \\"affordable\\" rates. Critics countered that similar set-asides for affordable housing have gone unfulfilled in previous large-scale developments, such as Battery Park City. The New York Times reported this proved to be the case in Williamsburg as well, as developers largely decided to forgo incentives to build affordable housing in inland areas.  Land use  Williamsburg contains a variety of zoning districts, including manufacturing, commercial, residential, and mixed-use. North Williamsburg contains primarily light industrial and medium-density residential buildings, as well as some residential structures with commercial space on the ground floors. There are also high-density residential developments with commercial space, as well as a few remaining heavy industries, along the waterfront. The area around Broadway is primarily commercial, and contains stores and offices. On the other hand, South Williamsburg is largely medium-to-high density residential, with some commercial space on the ground floors. Landmarked buildings =City landmarks= alt= Several structures in Williamsburg have been landmarked by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission. The Kings County Savings Institution, chartered in 1860, built the Kings County Savings Bank building at Bedford Avenue and Broadway. The structure, an example of French Second Empire architecture, has been on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) since 1980, and was made a New York City landmark in 1966.History Preserved: New York City Landmarks & Historic Districts, Harmon H. Gladstone & Martha Dalyrmple, Simon & Schuster, 1974). The Williamsburg Houses were designated a city landmark on June 24, 2003. The site, consisting of twenty 4-story buildings, was designed by William Lescaze, and was the first large- scale public housing in Brooklyn. It was completed in 1938, and is operated by the New York City Housing Authority.Williamsburg Houses, Landmarks Preservation Commission, June 24, 2003, Designation List 348. In 2007, three buildings of the Domino Sugar Refinery were also designated New York City Landmarks. The original refinery was built in 1856, and by 1870 processed more than half of sugar used in the United States. A fire in 1882 caused the plant to be completely rebuilt in brick and stone; these buildings exist today, though the refinery stopped operating in 2004.\\"Domino Sugar Refinery Buildings\\" on the Save Brooklyn's Industrial heritage website In 2010, a developer proposed to convert the site to residential use; since them, a new plan was approved for the Domino Sugar Factory, led by Two Trees Management.\\"Domino Sugar Refinery\\", ShopArc. Retrieved November 17, 2014. The New England Congregational Church and Rectory, built between 1852 and 1853, was listed on the NRHP in 1983. It is also a city landmark. The church was sold to its current occupant, La Iglesia Pentecostal La Luz del Mundo, in 1981. One historic district also exists in Williamsburg, the Fillmore Place Historic District. Landmarked in 2009, it consists of several Italianate style buildings. = National Register of Historic Places listings = Numerous structures are also located on the NRHP, but are not city landmarks. The Austin, Nichols and Company Warehouse, built in 1915 to a design by architect Cass Gilbert, was placed on the NRHP in 2007. Originally also a city landmark, the designation was later rescinded. The warehouse was converted to apartments in the 2010s. The German Evangelical Lutheran St. John's Church was built in 1883 and made a NRHP landmark in 2019. Public School 71K, built in 1888-1889 to designs by James W. Naughton, was made a NRHP landmark in 1982, though it no longer serves as a public school. The United States Post Office, built in 1936 by Louis A. Simon, was landmarked in 1988. Culture The subdivisions within Williamsburg vary widely. \\"South Williamsburg\\" refers to the area which today is occupied mainly by the Yiddish-speaking Hasidim (predominantly Satmar Hasidim) and a considerable Puerto Rican population. North of this area (with Division Street or Broadway serving as a dividing line) is an area known as \\"Los Sures\\", occupied by Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. To the north of that is the \\"North Side\\", traditionally Polish and Italian. East Williamsburg is home to many industrial spaces, and forms the largely Italian American, African American, and Hispanic area between Williamsburg and Bushwick. South Williamsburg, the South Side, the North Side, Greenpoint, and East Williamsburg all form Brooklyn Community Board 1. Its proximity to Manhattan has made it popular with recently arrived residents who are often referred to under the blanket term \\"hipster\\". Bedford Avenue and its subway station, as the first stop in the neighborhood on the BMT Canarsie Line (on the ), have become synonymous with this new wave of residents. Ethnic communities =Hasidic Jewish community= Hebrew Academy for Special Children Williamsburg is inhabited by tens of thousands of Hasidic Jews of various groups, and contains the headquarters of one faction of the Satmar Hasidic group. Williamsburg's Satmar population numbers about 57,000. Hasidic Jews first moved to the neighborhood in the years prior to World War II, along with many other religious and non-religious Jews who sought to escape the difficult living conditions on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Beginning in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the area received a large concentration of Holocaust survivors, many of whom were Hasidic Jews from rural areas of Hungary and Romania. These people were led by several Hasidic leaders, among them the rebbes of Satmar, Klausenberg, Vien, Pupa, Tzehlem, and Skver. In addition, Williamsburg contained sizable numbers of religious, but non-Hasidic, Jews. The Rebbe of Satmar, Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, ultimately exerted the most powerful influence over the community, causing many of the non-Satmars, especially the non-Hasidim, to leave. Teitelbaum was known for his fierce anti-Zionism and for his charismatic style of leadership. In the late 1990s, Jewish developers renovated old warehouses and factories, turning them into housing. More than 500 apartments were approved in the three-year period following 1997; soon afterward, an area near Williamsburg's border with Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant was re-zoned for affordable housing. By 1997, there were about 7,000 Hasidic families in Williamsburg, almost a third of whom took public assistance.Sexton, Joe. \\"Religion and Welfare Shape Economics for the Hasidim.\\" The New York Times. April 21, 1997. Retrieved on April 25, 2014. The Hasidic community of Williamsburg has one of the highest birthrates in the country, with an average of eight children per family. Each year, the community celebrates between 800 and 900 weddings for young couples, who typically marry between the ages of 18 and 21. Because Hasidic men receive little secular education, and women tend to be homemakers, college degrees are rare, and economic opportunities lag far behind the rest of the population. In response to the almost 60% poverty rate in Jewish Williamsburg, the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, a beneficiary agency of the UJA- Federation of New York, partnered with Masbia in the opening of a 50-seat kosher soup kitchen on Lee Avenue in November 2009. There are many households with Section 8 housing vouchers; in 2000, there were 1,394 voucher recipients in Williamsburg's nine Yiddish-speaking census tracts, but by 2014, Williamsburg had 3,296 voucher recipients within 12 Yiddish-speaking census tracts. In 2014, it was reported that Williamsburg's Jewish community had among the highest rates of applications for Section 8 housing vouchers. However, the newspaper New York Daily News doubted the legality of the applications. In 2016, the Daily News said that New York City census tracts with 30% or more of the population applying for Section 8 were present only in Williamsburg and scattered parts of the Bronx, except that Williamsburg's real estate was among the most rapidly gentrifying in the city. With the gentrification of North Williamsburg, Hasidim have fought to retain the character of their neighborhood, and have characterized the influx of what they call the artisten as a \\"plague\\" and \\"a bitter decree from Heaven\\". Tensions have risen over housing costs, loud and boisterous nightlife events, and the introduction of bike lanes along Bedford Avenue. Although gentrification is increasing, many developers, such as Isaac Hager, continue to build more housing for Haredi tenants. =Italian-American community and Our Lady of Mount Carmel= Our Lady of Mount Carmel Feast A significant component of the Italian community on the North Side were immigrants from the city of Nola near Naples. Residents of Nola every summer celebrate the \\"Festa dei Gigli\\" (feast of lilies) in honor of St. Paulinus of Nola, who was bishop of Nola in the fifth century,The Giglio, A Brief History , official website and the immigrants brought this tradition over with them. For two weeks every summer, the streets surrounding Our Lady of Mount Carmel church, located on Havemeyer and North 8th Streets, are dedicated to a celebration of Italian culture. The highlights of the feast are the \\"Giglio Sundays\\" when a tall statue, complete with band and a singer, is carried around the streets in honor of St. Paulinus and Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Clips of this awe- inspiring sight are often featured on NYC news broadcasts. A significant number of Italian-Americans still reside in the area, although the numbers have decreased over the years. Despite the fact that an increasing number of Italian-Americans have moved away, many return each summer for the feast. The Giglio was the subject of a documentary, Heaven Touches Brooklyn in July, narrated by actors John Turturro and Michael Badalucco. =Puerto Rican and Dominican community= On Williamburg's Southside, also known in Spanish as \\"Los Sures\\", which is the area south of Grand Street, there exists a sizable Puerto Rican and Dominican population. Puerto Ricans have been coming to the area since the 1940s and the 1950s, and Dominicans came in the 1970s and 1980s. Many Puerto Ricans flocked to the area after World War II, due to the proximity to jobs at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The neighborhood continues to have 27% Hispanic or Latino population, and Graham Avenue, between Grand Street and Broadway, is known as the \\"Avenue of Puerto Rico\\". Havemeyer Street is lined with Hispanic-owned bodegas and barber shops. However, even though the Southside has the highest concentration of Hispanics in the neighborhood, this population is dispersed throughout all of Williamsburg, as far north as the Williamsburg-Greenpoint border. The Latino community has several cultural institutions in Williamsburg. The Caribbean Social Club, the last remaining Puerto Rican social club in Williamsburg, preserves the neighborhood's culture. Another such institution is the \\"El Puente\\" Community Center, as well as the \\"San German\\" record store on Graham Avenue. Graham Avenue was renamed Avenue of Puerto Rico as a symbol of pride, just as the avenue's other alternate name, Via Vespucci, is meant to commemorate the historical Italian- American community.Banco Popular de Puerto Rico has a branch on Graham Avenue. In addition, Southside United HDFC is a charity organization that helps residents with housing needs and other services, including mobilizing housing activists and residents as well as providing affordable housing. The Moore Street Market, often referred to as La Marqueta de Williamsburg, is located at 110 Moore Street. In addition, there have been several cultural events. In the past Southside United HDFC has held Puerto Rican Heritage as well as Dominican Independence Day celebrations, and currently operates El Museo De Los Sures. The name El Museo De Los Sures roughly translates to \\"The Museum of the Southside\\". Williamsburg is also home to not one, but two campuses of Boricua College, the Northside campus on North 6th Street between Bedford Avenue and Driggs Avenue, as well as the East Williamburg/Bushwick campus on Graham Avenue. A place popular among Dominican-American residents is the Fula Lounge, where Merengue and Raggaeton artists from the Dominican Republic often frequent. Once a year, the Williamsburg/Bushwick community hosts a Puerto Rican Day parade. The neighborhood has produced many prominent Latinos. Television chef Daisy Martinez, who specializes in Puerto Rican cuisine grew up in the neighborhood. The neighborhood also is home to the office of U.S. representative Nydia Velazquez. In addition to this, Williamsburg was the childhood home of City Councilwoman Rosie M√©ndez, of Puerto Rican descent. Williamsburg itself was represented in the City Council by Dominican American Antonio Reynoso. The Hispanic sector as a whole was represented in a documentary called Living Los Sures, which documents the lives of Latino residents living in 1984 Southside before gentrification. Another documentary in 2013, \\"To√±ita's\\", depicts the Caribbean Social Club and named after the club's owner. =Ethnic and intercultural tensions= About 2 o'clock on November 7, 1854, a riot occurred between sheriffs and \\"some Irishmen\\" at the poll of the First District at the corner of 2nd and North 6th streets in Williamsburg. It began after a deputy approached a citizen and a fight started. Immediately, eight or ten deputies began freely using clubs on a group of \\"about one hundred Irishmen\\", resulting in a half-hour general fight and many injuries. Prior to gentrification, Williamsburg often saw tension between its Hasidic population and its black and Hispanic groups. In response to decades of rising crime in the area, the Hasidim created a volunteer patrol organization called \\"Shomrim\\" (\\"guardians\\" in Hebrew) to perform citizens' arrests, and to keep an eye out for crime. Over the years, the Shomrim have been accused of racism and brutality against blacks and Hispanics. In 2009, Yakov Horowitz, a member of Shomrim, was charged with assault for striking a Latino adolescent on the nose with his Walkie Talkie. In 2014, five members of the Hasidic community, at least two of whom were Shomrim members, were arrested in connection with the December 2013 \\"gang assault\\" of a black gay man. The mid-century tension between the Hasidic and Modern Orthodox Jewish communities in Williamsburg was depicted in Chaim Potok's novels The Chosen (1967), The Promise, and My Name Is Asher Lev.Fox, Margalit. \\"Chaim Potok, Who Illumined the World of Hasidic Judaism, Dies at 73\\", The New York Times, July 24, 2002. Accessed May 12, 2016. \\"Set in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn just after World War II, The Chosen tells the story of a brilliant young man struggling to reconcile his obligation to become a rabbi with his desire for a more secular life.\\" One contemporary female perspective on life in the Satmar community in Williamsburg is offered by Deborah Feldman's autobiographical Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots.Wiener, Julie. \\"Unapologetically ‚ÄòUnorthodox‚Äô With a memoir about growing up in ‚Äî and leaving ‚Äî Satmar Williamsburg, 25-year-old Deborah Feldman is one tough Jewess.\\", The Jewish Week, February 8, 2012. Accessed May 12, 2016. \\"That said, Unorthodox is actually a surprisingly moving, well-written, and vivid coming-of-age tale about a restless girl who is raised in Williamsburg by her grandparents because her father is mentally disabled and her mother left the community, effectively abandoning her, when she was a baby.\\" The Netflix miniseries Unorthodox is loosely based on Feldman's autobiography. Arts community =Visual arts= East Williamsburg The first artists moved to Williamsburg in the 1970s, drawn by the low rents, large floor area, and convenient transportation. This continued through the 1980s and increased significantly in the 1990s as earlier destinations such as SoHo and the East Village became gentrified. The community was small at first, but by 1996 Williamsburg had accumulated an artist population of about 3,000. Art galleries in the area include the Front Room Gallery. Williamsburg and Greenpoint are served by a monthly galleries listings magazine, wagmag. In September 2000, 11211 Magazine, created by writer Breuk Iversen, launched a four color glossy circulating 10,000 copies in Brooklyn and Manhattan, intent on promoting the area from a design firm in Manhattan. A year later, the firm moved to Williamsburg. The content was richly focused on the historical and notable properties, arts and culture and real estate development of the 11211 ZIP Code. The bi-monthly was funded by advertisements from local businesses and founded by writer and designer, Breuk Iversen. Other publications attributed to 11211 Magazine: Fortnight, The Box Map (2002), Appetite, and 10003 Magazine for the East Village in New York City. The magazine had published 36 issues (548,000 copies) of 11211 over a six-year period, and ceased circulation in 2006. =Musical community= A local bowling center also presents musical performances Williamsburg has become a notable home for live music and an incubator for new bands. Beginning in the late 1980s, and through the late 1990s, a number of unlicensed performance, theater, and music venues operated in abandoned industrial buildings and other spaces in the streets. A new culture has evolved in the area surrounding Bedford Avenue subway station. The Bog, Keep Refrigerated, The Lizard's Tail, Quiet Life, Rubulad, Flux Factory, Mighty Robot, free103point9 and others attracted a mix of artists, musicians and urban underground for late night music, dance, and performance events, which were occasionally interrupted and the venues temporarily closed by the fire department. These events eventually diminished in number as the rents rose in the area and regulations were enforced. There are a number of smaller, fleeting spaces, including Todd P., Dot Dash, Twisted Ones, and Rubulad. Many legitimate commercial music venues opened in the neighborhood including Pete's Candy Store,http://www.petescandystore.com/history/ Union Pool,https://www.union- pool.com/booking/ Music Hall of Williamsburg (formerly Northsix), Public Assembly (formerly Galapagos, now closed), Cameo Gallery, Muchmore's, and Grand Victory. Several Manhattan-based venues also opened locations, including Bowery Presents (who bought Northsix and transformed it to Music Hall of Williamsburg), Luna Lounge, Knitting Factory, and Cake Shop. In the summers of 2006, 2007, and 2008, events including concerts, movies, and dance performances were staged at the previously abandoned pool at McCarren Park in Greenpoint. Starting 2009, these pool parties are now held at the Williamsburg waterfront. The neighborhood has also attracted a respectable funk, soul and worldbeat music scene spearheaded by labels such as Daptone and Truth & Soul Records ‚Äì and fronted by acts such as the Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra and Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings. Jazz and World Music has found a foothold, with classic jazz full-time at restaurant venues like Zebulon and Moto, and ‚Äì on the more avant and noise side ‚Äì at spots like the Lucky Cat, B.P.M., Monkeytown (closed in 2010), and Eat Records. A Latin Jazz community continues amongst the Caribbean community in Southside and East Williamsburg, centered around the many social clubs in the neighborhood. In the early 2000s, the neighborhood also became a center of electroclash. Friday and Saturday parties at Club Luxx (now Trash) introduced electronic acts like W.I.T., A.R.E. Weapons, Fischerspooner, and Scissor Sisters. =Theatre and cinema= From left to right: Linda Hamilton, Jane Lynch, and Carol Leifer at the Williamsburg Independent Film Festival in 2016 Williamsburg contains indie theater spaces such as the Brick Theater and the Charlie Pineapple Theater. The Williamsburg Independent Film Festival was founded in 2010.The Williamsburg Independent Film Festival, Inc. Williamsburg also contains the first-run multiplex theater known as Williamsburg Cinemas, which opened on December 19, 2012. Effects of gentrification Williamsburg skyline, looking east. Low rents were a major reason artists first started settling in the area, but that situation has drastically changed since the mid-1990s. Average rents in Williamsburg can range from approximately $1,400 for a studio apartment to $1,600‚Äì2,400 for a one-bedroom and $2,600‚Äì4,000 for a two- bedroom. The price of land in Williamsburg has skyrocketed. The North Side, above Grand Street, which separates the North Side from the South Side, is somewhat more expensive due to its proximity to the New York City Subway (specifically, the and on the BMT Canarsie Line and IND Crosstown Line, respectively). More recent gentrification and the route of the M train (whose route was modified to go from the downtown BMT Nassau Street Line to the midtown IND Sixth Avenue Line in 2010), however, have prompted increases in rent prices south of Grand Street as well. Higher rents have driven many priced-out bohemians and hipsters to find new creative communities further afield in areas like Bushwick, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Cobble Hill, and Red Hook. On July 1, 2011, the United States Postal Service (USPS) split the 11211 zip code due to a \\"large increase in population and in the number of companies doing business in our area.\\" Williamsburg's gentrification is the subject of Princeton University film professor Su Friedrich's 2013 documentary Gut Renovation. =Effect on borough's court system= In June 2014, the New York Post reported that northwestern Brooklyn's change to a wealthier, more educated population, especially in Williamsburg, has led to an increasing number of convictions against defendants in the borough's criminal cases, as well as to reductions in plaintiff's awards in civil cases. Brooklyn defense lawyer Julie Clark said that these new jurors are \\"much more trusting of police\\". Another lawyer, Arthur Aidala, said: Demographics For census purposes, the New York City government classifies Williamsburg as part of two neighborhood tabulation areas: Williamsburg, and North Side/South Side.New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012.

The Williamsburgh branch is located at 240 Division Avenue, near Marcy Avenue. It is housed in a Carnegie library structure that is one of Brooklyn's largest circulating-library buildings, and is a New York City designated landmark. The Leonard branch is located at 81 Devoe Street, near Leonard Street. It is located in a building that opened in 1908. The Leonard branch contains a tribute to Betty Smith, the author of the novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, whose main character, France, frequently visited the library. Transportation Williamsburg is served by several New York City Subway routes. There are three physical lines through the neighborhood: the BMT Canarsie Line () on the north, the BMT Jamaica Line () on the south, and the IND Crosstown Line () on the east. The Williamsburg Bridge crosses the East River to the Lower East Side. Williamsburg is also served by the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Expressway. Several bus routes, including the , terminate at the Williamsburg Bridge / Washington Plaza. Other bus lines that run through the neighborhood include the . In June 2011, NY Waterway started service to points along the East River. On May 1, 2017, that route became part of the NYC Ferry's East River route, which runs between Pier 11 / Wall Street in Manhattan's Financial District and the East 34th Street Ferry Landing in Murray Hill, Manhattan, with five intermediate stops in Brooklyn and Queens. Two of the East River Ferry's stops are in Williamsburg. There are plans to build the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Connector (BQX), a light rail system that would run along the waterfront from Red Hook through Williamsburg to Astoria in Queens. However, the system is projected to cost $2.7 billion, and the projected opening has been delayed until at least 2029. Environmental concerns El Puente, a local community development group, called Williamsburg \\"the most toxic place to live in America\\", in the documentary Toxic Brooklyn, produced by Vice Magazine in 2009.Toxic ‚Äì Brooklyn, Vice Broadcasting, VBS.tv Other rare cancer clusters in Willamsburg have been reported by the New York Post.  Brooklyn Navy Yard incinerator plan  In 1976, Mayor Abraham Beame proposed building a combined incinerator and power plant at the nearby Brooklyn Navy Yard. The project garnered large community opposition from the Latino and Hasidic Jewish residents of southern Williamsburg, located next to the site of the proposed incinerator. Though the New York City Board of Estimate narrowly gave its approval to the incinerator in 1984, the state refused to grant a permit for constructing the plant for several years, citing that the city had no recycling plan. The proposed incinerator was a key issue in the 1989 mayoral election because the Hasidic Jewish residents of Williamsburg who opposed the incinerator were also politically powerful. David Dinkins, who ultimately won the 1989 mayoral election, campaigned on the stance that the Brooklyn Navy Yard incinerator plan should be put on hold. The state denied a permit for the incinerator in 1989, stating that the city had no plan for reducing ash emissions from the plant. The plan was placed on hold for several years, and in 1995, community members filed a lawsuit to block the incinerator's construction. Further investigation of the incinerator's proposed site found toxic chemicals were present in such high levels that the site qualified for Superfund environmental cleanup. The next year, the city dropped plans for the construction of the incinerator altogether. Bushwick Inlet Park site National Grid (formerly KeySpan) is remediating contamination at a former Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) site, located at Kent Avenue, between North 11th and North 12th Streets, in Williamsburg. The Remediation is being performed in conversion for the site's conversion into Bushwick Inlet Park. It is being implemented under an order of consent with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation entered into between the NYSDEC and KeySpan in February 2007. There are also ten oil storage tanks on the site of Bushwick Inlet Park that were formerly operated by Bayside Oil. A plan unveiled in 2016, called \\"Maker Park\\", would convert the oil tankers into attractions such as a theater and hanging gardens. It directly conflicted with the original plan for Bushwick Inlet Park, which would see the tankers demolished. The city stated that the oil tankers were heavily polluted, and that the site needed to be cleaned before it could be repurposed into a park.

Solomoukha ( 2 November 1945 ‚Äì 21 October 2015) was a Ukrainian-born French artist and photographer, and a foreign member of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts. From 1980, he specialized in narrative figuration. After 2000, he developed photo projects and is known as the inventor of a new form of expression in contemporary photography: ‚ÄúPhoto painting‚Äù. In it, he associates the photographic image with pictorial research in tableaux frequently requiring a multitude of models. Biography Solomoukha was born in Kiev, Ukraine (then part of the USSR). His family was part of the Soviet intelligentsia. His father, Pavel Davidovich Solomoukha, was a veteran of the Second World War. In 1943, following the liberation of Ukraine, he was given the job of recruiting and organizing the training of teachers in a department under the Secretariat of Nikita Khrushchev, who later became the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. His mother, Galina von Krigin, was a teacher. After completing his secondary education and doing his military service, Anton entered the Faculty for the Restoration of Icons in The Kiev School of Fine Art. It was here that he familiarized himself with philosophy and religion. In 1971, Solomukha was admitted to the studio workshop of the academician T. Yablonska and in 1973, he obtained a diploma as a ‚ÄòMonumentalist‚Äô painter. His vision of the world was influenced by artists such as stage designer Misha Frenkel, director Sergei Parajanov, writer Viktor Nekrasov, etc. In 1971, his daughter Kristina Solomoukha was born. Between 1975 and 1978, his dissident creative expression attracted the attention of political censors and he was summoned to appear before the KGB on several occasions. In 1978, he finally succeeded in immigrating to France. He has lived and worked in Paris ever since. Work Painting The Myths and the Limits. Failed Immaculate Conception. 179x179cm. Between 1978 and 1980, Solomoukha began a period of experimentation with various techniques and types of aesthetic formulas. A voyage to the United States in 1978‚Äì1980 proved to be a decisive moment in his artistic career. In 1980, he exhibited in New York City, Boston, Cleveland, Washington, and Philadelphia. In 1981, 1982, and 1983, he was invited by the violinist Gidon Kremer to be the stage designer in the Lockenhauskamermusikfest festival of chamber music in Lockenhaus, Austria. The influence of classical music, and his contact with renowned musicians left its mark in the work he did during this period. In 1985, the project \\"the Great Myths\\" drew the attention of Cologne gallery owner Thomas Krings-Ernsta and Solomoukha exhibited there regularly until 1989. In 1988, two paintings were acquired by Cologne's Ludwig Museum for its French Collection. Until 2002, a series of Solomoukha's projects, such as \\"Boxers\\", \\"Mechanical Toys\\", \\"The Myths and the Limits\\", and \\"Jazz\\" were characterized by the formal search for ways of expression through opposition of different structures of thought, and by his obsession for paradox. His ideological, aesthetic, and ethical positions were formed under the influence of the French art critics Bernard Lamarche-Vadel and Michel Enrici. The series of paintings titled \\"Allegory\\" (1979‚Äì2002) was much more figurative and picturesque. Citations of works of Baroque and a search for heroes and anti-heroes, based on major composite structures, were undergoing constant change, often under the influence of the photographic image. Photography Petit Chaperon Rouge visite le Grand Louvre. 72x180. 2008. Nicolas Poussin. Rape of the Sabine Women In the search for new means of expression, a new visual language, Solomoukha became more and more attracted to photography. In 1990, he was acquainted with Robert Doisneau and in 1995, he began working with Henri Cartier-Bresson. Both acquaintances strongly influenced his decision to devote himself to photography, which was his principal sphere of creativity since 2002. His first photographic series consisted of \\"The girl with the cup-and-ball\\", \\"The Sex of Angels\\", \\"I Fuck Your TV\\", was characterized by the choice of a closed space and a dark background. He used mirrors as 'a complementary character' for the construction of a subject, ironic or poetic, inspired by historical myths and biblical subjects. His obsession with these projects evolved into a rejection of temporal social topics. He created a series of photo compositions in the monumental style titled \\"Little Red Riding Hood visits the Louvre\\". Although these large square panoramic compositions were technically photographs, they were projected and constructed as if they were painted pictures. This style, called \\"photo-painting\\", played a role in the creation of a new contemporary art form. Mona Lisa di Antonio Maria (Antonmaria) Gherardini del Giocondo The photographic paintings of this series were rather theatrical. The backgrounds were dark and the foregrounds filled with actors: characters from the streets of Paris interposed with naked models, animals and elements of still life. An infinite number of small objects were strewn on the ground and covered the walls. The theatrical tableau style of this collection enabled the artist to break with the traditional photographic image and create a paradoxical metaphysical space. In them, each character, as in an opera, played a part while remaining an independent element. In 2009, Solomoukha continued to refer to classical art in his project \\"Little Red Riding Hood visits Chernobyl\\". His preference for \\"ironic allegory\\" allowed him to create works in a form reminiscent of paintings in the Louvre, depicting morbid scenes of the Chernobyl catastrophe.

Some scouts are interested primarily in the selection of prospects, younger players who may require further development by the acquiring team but who are judged to be worthy of that effort and expense for the potential future payoff that it could bring, while others concentrate on players who are already polished professionals whose rights may be available soon, either through free agency or trading, and who are seen as filling a team's specific need at a certain position. Advance scouts watch the teams that their teams are going to play in order to help determine strategy. Many scouts are former coaches or retired players, while others have made a career just of being scouts. Skilled scouts who help to determine which players will fit in well with an organization can be the major difference between success and failure for the team with regard to wins and losses, which often relates directly to the organization's financial success or lack thereof as well. Kinds of scouts Scouts tend to have to perform one of two tasks, either scouting opposition teams to research the opposition's players and tactics, or scouting individual players to identify their level of skill and to keep track of potential new signings. Contemporary Major League Baseball teams usually classify scouts and their differing responsibilities as follows: *Advance scouts follow the MLB clubs that their team is scheduled to play and file reports on trends and tendencies that influence pitching, defensive, offensive and game strategy. *Major League scouts and professional scouts (the most senior of whom are sometimes called \\"special assignment scouts\\" or \\"special assistants to the general manager\\") typically track active players under contract to other teams for potential acquisition. They also may support advance scouts or evaluate competing minor league organizations. Per their designation, the former follow players in MLB, while \\"pro scouts\\" work minor league and independent league baseball. *Amateur scouts evaluate high school and college baseball players and prepare their MLB teams for the June amateur draft. To ensure that players are seen by multiple evaluators, amateur scouts are usually divided into area scouts, regional cross-checkers and national cross-checkers. *International scouts cover players not from the United States, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories, or Canada. These players are signed as international free agents and are not subject to the June draft, although bonus amounts and signing regulations are governed by the collective bargaining agreement between MLB and its players' union. In addition to the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Mexico, and other Latin American and Caribbean countries, where MLB teams have had a scouting presence since the mid-20th century, the growth in international baseball has compelled most teams to station scouts in Japan, Korea and other Asian countries, Australia, and Europe. International scouting also involves cross-checking to enable multiple evaluators to validate the reports of local scouts.

Computer-aided scouting Modern day scouts are becoming more and more reliant on computer programs to aid and assist in the evaluation of talent being scouted.

A member of the Saudi royal family, he was the longest-serving foreign minister in world history since Klemens von Metternich. Early life, education and early career Saud bin Faisal was born in Taif on 2 January 1940. He was the second son of the Arabian King Faisal and Iffat Al-Thunayan who was born to a Turkish family. He was the full brother of Sara bint Faisal, Mohammed bin Faisal, Latifa bint Faisal, Abdul Rahman bin Faisal, Bandar bin Faisal, Turki bin Faisal, Luluwah bint Faisal, Sara bint Faisal and Haifa bint Faisal. Prince Saud attended the Hun School of PrincetonThomas, Katrina. \\"America as Alma Mater\\", Saudi Aramco World, May/June 1979. Retrieved 27 January 2011. and graduated from Princeton University in 1964 with a bachelor of arts degree in economics. In 2007 he told Ford Fraker, then US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, that during his studies at Princeton he would like to leave the university and to return to the country. However, his father, Faisal, came to the campus and persuaded him to complete his education. Following his return to Saudi Arabia Prince Saud became an economic consultant for the ministry of petroleum. In 1966, he moved to general organization for petroleum and mineral resources (Petromin). In February 1970, he became deputy governor of Petromin for planning affairs. He was also a member of the High Coordination Committee. In 1971, he became deputy minister of petroleum. Prince Saud served in this post at the oil ministry until 1975 when he was appointed as state minister for foreign affairs. Foreign Minister Saud bin Faisal was appointed to the post in October 1975. His term ended on 29 April 2015 when he was replaced by Adel al- Jubeir, a former Saudi ambassador to the United States. Timeline On 13 October 1975, King Khalid appointed him as foreign minister.http://saudalfaisal.com/index_En.html He was well regarded in the diplomatic community. In May 1985, he officially visited Iran and meetings were focused on the annual pilgrimage of Iranians to Mecca. The same year Prince Saud raised awareness in Britain of Soviet activity in the Horn of Africa. He asked Condoleezza Rice to focus on \\"key substantive issues\\" of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. He complained that US banks were auditing Saudi Embassy banks illegally. He asserted that auditors were \\"inappropriate and aggressive\\". He also declared that the Saudi Embassy has diplomatic immunity. Prince Saud said in 2004 that Saudi Arabia would like to reduce its dependence on U.S.-dominated security arrangements. In July 2004, he claimed the real source of problems in the Middle East were not Muslims but \\"injustice and deprivation inflicted in the region\\". In August 2007, he denied allegations that terrorists were travelling from Saudi Arabia to Iraq and claimed it was vice versa. On 10 March 2006, he met with Hamas leaders in Riyadh. In July 2006, he urged U.S. President George W. Bush to call for a ceasefire in the Lebanon bombing.Abramowitz, Michael, and Robin Wright.Saudi Arabia Asks U.S. to Intervene in Lebanon. The Washington Post, 24 July 2006. Retrieved 29 May 2011. In January 2008, he supported parliamentary elections in Pakistan. He indicated that Pakistan did not need \\"overt, external interference\\" to solve political division. He commended Nawaz Sharif as stable bipartisan candidate. In February 2010, he told General Jones to distinguish between friends and enemies in Pakistan rather than using indiscriminate military action. He insisted that Pakistan's army must maintain its credibility. In November 2010, he led the Saudi delegation at the G-20 Summit. In January 2011, he withdrew out of mediation efforts to reinstate a government in Lebanon. In March 2011, he went to Europe to rally support for Saudi Arabia's intervention in Bahrain. thumb After U.S. Gulf Cooperation Council forum at the GCC secretariat in Riyadh on 31 March 2012, he said it was a \\"duty\\" to arm the Syrian opposition and help them defend themselves against the daily bloody crackdown by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Commenting on the fragile security situation, Prince Saud noted that: \\"One of the most important causes is the continuation of the unresolved conflict as well as the continuation of the Israeli aggression policy against the Palestinians. \\"We have discussed, in the meeting, many issues, especially the heinous massacre against the Syrian people. We also discussed the latest developments in Yemen, and reviewed the overall developments and political situation in the Persian Gulf region, the Middle East and North Africa, as well as their repercussions on the security and stability of the region and the world,\\" Prince Saud said. Iran and Lebanon Rather than military action on Iran, Saud Al Faisal called for tougher sanctions such as travel bans and further bank lending restrictions. He has stated U.S. foreign policy has tilted more power for Iran. He compared the Iranian influence in Iraq with Iranian influence in Lebanon. He commended positive developments by Iran such as its influence over Hezbollah to end street protests. In early 2011, he expressed fear of the \\"dangerous\\" instability in Lebanon after the fall of the Saad Hariri government. He also stated that Lebanon's ability to establish peaceful coexistence with so many different groups may be a significant loss in the Arab world if the nation failed in creating a government. Russian President Vladimir Putin on 14 February 2008. In May 2014 it was reported that Prince Saud had invited Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to visit Riyadh, breaking the ice in one of the most hostile relationships in the Middle East ahead of key talks on Iran's nuclear program in Vienna. Speaking to reporters in the Saudi capital, Foreign Minister Prince Saud said the kingdom was ready to host Iranian Foreign Minister \\"anytime he sees fit\\" and indicated that Riyadh was willing to open negotiations with its nemesis on the many combustible issues dividing them. Other governmental activities Starting in 1998 under the reign of King Fahd, Saud Al Faisal and then the Crown Prince Abdullah managed the energy sector through a committee of technocrats and princes. More specifically, Prince Saud was appointed chairman of the Saudi Aramco's committee charged with the project assessment in September 1999. On 20 November 2009, King Abdullah appointed Prince Saud as the chairman of the influential supreme economic council of Saudi Arabia. Prince Saud was also a member of the military service council. Views Saudi foreign policy is designed by the King, not by the foreign minister. Prince Saud worked closely with King Khalid, King Fahd and King Abdullah. Prince Saud was firmly anti- Soviet and was an Arab nationalist. He was more resistant to Israeli proposals than King Fahd. He lamented his legacy might be defined \\"by profound disappointment than by success\\". He regretted how his generation of leaders failed to create a Palestinian state. He encouraged Iraqis to defend their country's sovereignty. In the Saudi royal court, his relationship with King Fahd was strained, but he was one of King Abdullah's closest allies. He was among the Saudi officials who worked to improve Saudi Arabia's international image and maintain its strong relationship with the United States after the September 11 attacks.Saudi Arabia in the Balance: Political Economy, Society, Foreign Affairs (2006), ed. by Paul Aarts and Gerd Nonneman Personal life Prince Saud was married to his cousin Jawhara bint Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman, and they have three sons and three daughters. His sons are Mohammad, Khaled and Fahd, and his daughters are Haifa, Lana and Reem. Haifa bint Saud is married to Prince Sultan bin Salman and is a professor of English literature working at King Saud University. Prince Saud lived in Jeddah. Unlike other members of the Al Saud, he often spoke publicly and interacted with reporters. He spoke several languages, including English, Spanish, Hebrew, French, Italian, and German. He liked to play tennis. Business activities and properties Prince Saud is one of the Saudi royals mentioned in Panama Papers due to his offshore accounts. He had a house in Los Angeles's the Beverly Hills Post Office neighborhood which he built in 1983. Social roles Prince Saud involved in philanthropy. He was a founding member of the King Faisal Foundation and served as chairman of the board of directors for the King Faisal School and Al Faisal University in Riyadh. He was also a member of the Society for Disabled Children and the Madinah Society for Welfare and Social Services. Illness and death Prince Saud suffered from Parkinson's disease and back pain. He had surgery in the United States. His physical appearance showed signs of health deterioration, especially difficulty standing upright. On 11 August 2012, he had another surgery to remove a \\"simple\\" blockage in the intestines due to adhesions resulting from previous surgery. The operation was performed at the Specialist Hospital in Jeddah. Prince Saud went to Los Angeles after he left the hospital on 6 September 2012. The ministry announced that he would stay there for a while. On 25 January 2015, Prince Saud had a successful spine surgery in the U.S. In March 2015 he was photographed using a walker. With age, Saud faced many health problems, suffering from chronic back pain and having had various surgeries. Prince Saud died on 9 July 2015 at the age of 75 in Los Angeles. His funeral prayer was held in Grand Mosque in Mecca on 12 July 2015, and he was buried in Al Adl cemetery.

It subjected Members of Parliament to very strict party discipline. Party leaders received unlimited power to dismiss any of their legislators from Parliament if they spoke or voted against their party.Husain Haqqani, Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military (2005), Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, page 244. The fourteenth amendment to the constitution of Pakistan was to prevent the switching of parties to form a strong coalition government or to become a strong opposition. Since Nawaz' party had an overwhelming majority in Parliament, the Fourteenth Amendment effectively prevented the Prime Minister from being dismissed by a no confidence vote. A few months earlier, the Thirteenth Amendment took away the President's reserve power to remove a Prime Minister by dissolving Parliament and calling new elections. The amendments removed nearly all checks and balances on the Prime Minister's power, since there was virtually no way he could be legally dismissed. In Pakistan, once legislators are elected to national or provincial assemblies, there is no way for the people to recall them before the end of their five-year terms. In the past, this has contributed to a sense of immunity on the part of members of the ruling party, and to rampant corruption among leading politicians. The Fourteenth Amendment increased this perception, and contributed to the overwhelming popular support for General Pervez Musharraf's coup in 1999. The Supreme Court subsequently validated the coup on the grounds that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments created a situation for which there was no constitutional remedy.

It lost to the Lockheed Martin X-35 demonstrator, which was further developed into the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. Development Background In 1993, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter project (CALF). The project's purpose was to develop a stealth-enabled design to replace all of United States Department of Defense lighter weight fighter and attack aircraft, including the F-16 Fighting Falcon, McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, and vertical/short takeoff / vertical landing (V/STOL) AV-8B Harrier II.DARPA / \\"Navy Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter (CALF) 1993-1994.\\" globalsecurity.org. Retrieved: 13 September 2009. Around the same time the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) project was started.\\"Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST).\\" globalsecurity.org. Retrieved: 13 September 2009. In 1994, the U.S. Congress ordered the two to be merged into the Joint Strike Fighter program. Many companies took part in the first phase of this project, which involved drafting concept aircraft designs for submission to the Department of Defense. On 16 November 1996, Boeing and Lockheed Martin were awarded contracts for them to produce two of their concept demonstrator aircraft (CDA) each. Under the contract, these fighters were required to demonstrate conventional take-off and landing (CTOL), carrier take-off and landing (CV version), and short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL). They were also expected to include ground demonstrations of a production representative aircraft's systems, such as the Preferred Weapon System Concept (PWSC). One major departure from previous projects was the prohibition of the companies from using their own money to finance development. Each was awarded $750 million to produce their two aircraft ‚Äì including avionics, software and hardware. This limitation promoted the adoption of low cost manufacturing and assembly techniques, and also prevented either Boeing or Lockheed Martin from bankrupting themselves in an effort to win such an important contest. Designing the X-32 Boeing's strategy for a competitive advantage was to offer substantially lower manufacturing and life-cycle costs by minimizing variations between the different JSF versions. The X-32 therefore was designed around a large one piece carbon fiber composite delta wing. The wing had a span of 9.15 meters, with a 55-degree leading edge sweep and could hold up to 20,000 pounds of fuel. The purpose of the high sweep angle was to allow for a thick wing section to be used while still providing limited transonic aerodynamic drag, and to provide a good angle for wing-installed conformal antenna equipment.Sweetman, Bill. Lockheed Stealth. St. Paul, Minnesota: MBI, 2001. . The wing would prove a challenge to fabricate.\\"Battle of the X-Planes.\\" NOVA, NOVA (TV series), airdate: 4 February 2003.\\"Battle of the X-Planes.\\" NOVA (TV series) transcripts. Retrieved: 30 June 2011. The compete-on-cost strategy also led Boeing to pick a direct-lift thrust vectoring system, for the Marines' short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) requirement, as this would only necessitate the addition of a thrust vectoring module around the main engine. However, this choice required the engine to be mounted directly behind the cockpit, and moved the center of gravity forward from its usual position in jet fighters (towards the rear of the airplane) to enable a neutral-attitude hover. Boeing had proposed, in the 1960s, a similar supersonic fighter with a mid-center-of- gravity mounted engine with vectored thrust nozzles, but this never proceeded beyond pictures published in Aviation Week. By comparison, the Lockheed entry looked like, if anything, a smaller version of the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. The Boeing in-house nickname of the X-32 was the \\"Monica\\".Wilkinson, Stephan. \\"The 13 Ugliest Airplanes.\\" Aviation History magazine, 9 March 2011. Retrieved: 27 May 2012. Yet another effect of the selection of the direct-lift system was the large chin-mounted air intake. This was required to feed sufficient air to the main engine (to provide the thrust necessary to hover) during the zero horizontal velocity phase, when it could not exploit ram-air pressure. A knock on effect of this large intake, was the potential direct visibility of the compressor blades to radar (see radar cross-section). Mitigation possibilities included variable baffles designed to block incoming radio waves without adversely affecting airflow. Design changes The two X-32 aircraft featured a delta wing design. However, eight months into construction of the concept demonstrator aircraft, the JSF's maneuverability and payload requirements were refined at the request of the Navy and Boeing's delta wing design fell short of the new targets. Engineers altered the aircraft's design with a conventional canted twin tail that reduced weight and improved agility, but it was too late to change the aircraft. It was judged that they would be sufficient to demonstrate Boeing's technology. On 14 December 1999, Boeing unveiled both its concept demonstrators at its plant in Palmdale, California, in front of 5,500 attendants. While the X-32A was expected to make an appearance, the roll out of the X-32B was a surprise, as construction of the latter aircraft had started some three months after the former and was completed six weeks after the X-32A. Boeing attributed the rapid construction of the STOVL version to the use of digital design and assembly methods. After having the Pratt & Whitney F119 engine installed in April 2000, the X-32A commenced low- and medium-speed taxi tests, which had been completed by late May. Flight testing Due to the heavy delta wing design of the X-32, Boeing demonstrated STOVL and supersonic flight in separate configurations, with the STOVL configuration requiring that some parts be removed from the fighter. The company promised that their conventional tail design for production models would not require separate configurations. By contrast, the Lockheed Martin X-35 concept demonstrator aircraft were capable of transitioning between their STOVL and supersonic configurations in mid-flight. The first flight of the X-32A (designed for CTOL and carrier trials) took place on 18 September 2000, from Boeing's Palmdale plant to Edwards Air Force Base. The aircraft, piloted by Boeing test pilot Fred Knox, took of runway before becoming airborne at at around 8:00 am. Shortly after takeoff, a minor hydraulic leak was discovered and the flight was shortened to 20 minutes from the expected 30‚Äì40 minutes. According to Knox, the F/A-18 chase plane required \\"a lot of afterburner\\" to keep up with the X-32 during the initial stages. During the flight, the aircraft reached , attained a speed of , and attained an angle of attack of 13¬∞. Despite the shortened flight, about 80% of the planned test points were accomplished. It was powered by a conventional derivative of the F-22 afterburning turbofan, designated F119-PW-614C. On 29 March 2001, the X-32B STOVL version made its first flight. The flight lasted 50 minutes as the aircraft flew from Palmdale to Edwards AFB. The flight had originally been scheduled for the third quarter of 2000. A modified version of the -614C engine, known as the F119-PW-614S powered the STOVL aircraft.http://www.oocities.org/fishbed00.geo/us/jsf.html In normal flight, the -614S was configured as a conventional afterburning turbofan. However, in the STOVL mode a butterfly valve diverted the core stream exhaust gases to a pair of thrust vectoring nozzles located close to the aircraft's center-of-gravity. Forward of these nozzles, a jet screen nozzle provided a sheet of cool bypass air to minimise hot gas recirculation. There was also a pair of ducts leading to roll nozzles near the wing tips. Two pairs of ducts fed the aft-pitch yaw nozzles and the forward-pitch nozzles.https://s-media-cache- ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0d/b3/13/0db31356ad1dcf66132572dca0842cae.jpg The afterburner was unlit, with no gas flow during lift. The X-32B achieved STOVL flight in much the same way as the AV-8B Harrier II with thrust vectoring of the jet exhaust. A smooth transition (between STOVL and normal modes) was obtained by maintaining a constant engine match, facilitated by the control system algorithm maintaining a fixed total nozzle effective area. Thus the engine was unaware of various nozzles being opened up and closed off to complete the transition. Basically the F119-PW-614S was a direct lift engine, whereas the Lockheed Martin STOVL team used a more complex and riskier alternative, known as the F119-PW-611, which comprised a remote shaft-driven lift fan powered by the main engine. However, this generated more lift thrust than possible with only direct exhaust gases. A successful design would have greater payload, and thus longer range than a simple thrust vectored turbofan.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2001/2001%20-%202278.html Flight testing of both companies' aircraft continued until July 2001. JSF competition Boeing's JSF production mockup. Note the separate wing and tailplanes. On 26 October 2001, the Department of Defense announced that the Lockheed Martin X-35 won the JSF competition. The X-35 would be developed into the production Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. The loss of the JSF contract to Lockheed Martin in 2001 was a major blow to Boeing, as it represented the most important international fighter aircraft project since the Lightweight Fighter program competition of the 1960s and 1970s, which had led to the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F/A-18 Hornet. At the time, the production run of the JSF was estimated at anywhere between 3,000 and 5,000.'Lockheed Martin Wins JSF Contract.\\" allbusiness.com, 1 December 2001. Retrieved: 13 September 2009. Prior to the awarding of the contract, many lawmakers pushed the idea of retaining the losing competitor as a sub-contractor; however, the \\"winner takes all\\" principle was not changed. Nonetheless, Boeing views its work on the X-32 as a strategic investment, yielding important technologies which it has been able to adopt in the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and other studies.

The song consists of one verse repeated over and over again (usually repeated four times) with increasing in volume (or decreasing). Quieter and quieter, it is repeated four more times except for the closing \\"DA-DA-DA...!\\" phrase for each iteration. On the \\"DA- DA-DA...!\\", it's always louder. However, there have also been versions where it also speeds up. There are other ways of singing this song such as increasing (accelerando) or decreasing (ritardando) in tempo after each repetition. The lyrics of the song depend on who is singing. Lyrics and melody There are various lyrics to the song; for example, the following is one version, which is repeated several times (four times), often while altering the tempo or pitch:\\"Bug Juice Days\\" Lynch, Dan { \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 \\\\repeat volta 2 { fis'2 e'4 d' a8 fis'8 fis'8 f'8 fis'4 r g'8 g'4 g'8 a'4 e'4 fis'2. r8 fis'8 a fis' fis' eis' fis'4. ais8 b8 g' g' fis' g'4 fis'8 g' a'4 a'8. b'16 a'8 g' fis' e' d' a' a' b' a' g' fis' e' } } \\\\addlyrics { John Ja- -cob Jin- -gle- -heim- -er Schmidt!

(Ya da da da da da da...) } Origin While the origins of the song are obscure, some evidence places its roots with vaudeville and theatre acts of the late 19th century and early 20th century popular in immigrant communities. Some vaudeville acts during the era, such as the work of Joe Weber and Lew Fields, often gave voice to shared frustrations of German-American immigrants and heavily leaned on malapropisms and difficulties with the English language as a vehicle for its humor. Further, \\"John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt\\" shares many characteristics with \\"My Name Is Jan Jansen\\", a song that can trace its origin to Swedish vaudeville in the late 19th century. By the mid-20th century, the song appears to have already become widely known. In 1931, the Elmira Star Gazette, a newspaper in upstate New York, reported that at a Boy Scout gathering at Seneca Lake, as scouts entered the mess hall \\"Troop 18 soon burst into the first camp song, 'John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith'.\\"Elmira Star-Gazette. \\"Scouts Open Camp Seneca Term Sunday\\".

History A Robert de Chandos went to Ireland with King John in 1185. His son Roger in 1221 received licence to hold a fair at Fownhope in 1221. The son of this Roger, Robert de Chandos (d. 1302) participated in the Welsh expedition of Edward I. The son of Robert, Roger de Chandos, served in the Scottish wars of Edward II and received a knighthood. In 1321, he was sheriff of Herefordshire. He was succeeded by Thomas de Chandos.Wilhelmina Powlett, Duchess of Cleveland, The Battle Abbey Roll vol. 1 (1889), s.v. \\"Chaundos\\". Thomas was succeeded by his brother Roger de Chandos (Rogerus de Chaundos). Roger was made knight banneret by Edward III. It was this Roger who was summoned to parliament, and who was cited as Baron de Chandos between 1337 (11th year of Edward III) and 1355, counting as the first creation of the title.Thomas Christopher Banks, Baronia Anglica Concentrata (1844), p. 151. Roger was succeeded by his son Thomas, who was in turn succeeded by his son John. Neither of these were summoned to parliament, and are thus not named Baron Chandos explicitly, but counted as de jure 2nd and 3rd Barons Chandos, respectively. John, who defended Hereford Castle against Owen Glendwr in 1403, died without issue in 1428. The Chandos estates in Herefordshire passed to the surviving daughter of John's sister Elizabeth, wife of Nicholas Mattesden, and eventually to his great nephew Giles Brugge, de jure 4th Baron Chandos and father of Thomas Brugge, 5th Baron Chandos (d. 1493). Thomas' son, Giles Brugge, 6th Baron Chandos (d. 1511) held the office of High Sheriff of Gloucestershire for 1499.

In 1554, he was given Sudeley Castle and created \\"Baron Chandos, of Sudeley in the county of Gloucester\\" by Queen Mary, in the second creation of the title. The three succeeding barons were all Members of Parliament and persons of some importance ‚Äî see particularly Grey, 5th Baron, and his elder son George, 6th Baron. George had six daughters but no sons, and after the death of his brother William in 1676 the barony came to a kinsman, Sir James Brydges, Bart., who was English ambassador to Istanbul from 1680 to 1685. The eighth baron's eldest son, James Brydges (1674‚Äì1744), succeeded his father as ninth Baron Chandos in 1714. In the same year, he was created Earl of Carnarvon (second creation) and Duke of Chandos in 1719. Subsidiary titles included Marquess of Carnarvon (1719) and Viscount Wilton (1714). All of these titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. The 1st Duke built an exceptionally grand country house called Cannons that, though it was parodied in his lifetime, was a seat of great learning and culture: Handel was the resident composer from 1717 until 1719. Brydges' Cannons was demolished after his death, to pay the debts he incurred in the South Sea Bubble disaster, and by his son. It was replaced by a modest villa built by William Hallett, and Cannons is now occupied by North London Collegiate School whose Archives contain some information on the Duke, his second wife Cassandra Willoughby, and subsequent owners of Cannons. Jane Austen was descended from his sister Mary. With the death of the third duke in 1789, the titles became extinct, and the barony became dormant. An attempt was made by Samuel Egerton Brydges to claim the barony, initially on behalf of his older brother Edward Tymewell Brydges and then on his own behalf. Litigation lasted from 1790 to 1803 before the claims were rejected, but Egerton Brydges continued to style himself per legem terrae Baron Chandos of Sudeley. It seems likely that not only was the claim groundless but that the evidence was forged.

They are classed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and are protected by law. They form the largest surviving Roman barrow group in England. Beside their historical significance, they lend their name to an important thoroughfare in the town (Six Hills Way) and are a local landmark. History For almost two thousand years, travellers along the Roman road that eventually became the Great North Road have passed these six large mounds. Their origin and purpose has been the subject of much speculation. Local legend holds that they were the work of the Devil, who, sitting one day looking down on the Great North Road, began to amuse himself by heaving clods of earth at the passers-by. He missed six times and in a temper threw a seventh clod over his shoulder, hitting the spire of Graveley church and knocking it askew. The spire is crooked to this day. The holes in Whomerley Wood show where the Devil dug out his missiles, and the six failed shots lie in a line alongside the road and form the Six Hills. The Six Hills are almost certainly Roman burial mounds, dating from about 100 A.D., and probably mark the cremated remains of a wealthy local family. The ashes would have been placed in a container along with objects for use in the next world. No recent scientific archaeological excavation has been carried out on the Hills, but they have all been dug into in the past. These early investigations found only \\"...a few pieces of wood and a piece of iron...\\", which were dismissed at the time, but probably were the remains of the original burials. Other reports of damage include the farmer who was carting soil away from the Hills in 1750, and an attempted widening of the Great North Road in about 1820. Over the years, the Hills have all lost over in height.The Six Hills, April 2004 The grass around the burial mounds is of considerable age. It includes species such as bird's-foot trefoil, mouse-ear hawkweed, harebells, whitlow grass, and slender clover, which are not found in the more modern grasslands nearby.

(Urdu: ÿ¢ÿ¶€åŸÜ Ÿæÿß⁄©ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ŸÖ€å⁄∫ ÿ™€åÿ±€ÅŸà€å⁄∫ ÿ™ÿ±ŸÖ€åŸÖ) was a short-time amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan, adopted by the elected Parliament of Pakistan in 1997 by the government of people elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. It stripped the President of Pakistan of his reserve power to dissolve the National Assembly, and thereby triggering new elections and dismissing the Prime Minister. The Constitutional Amendment was supported by both the government and the opposition, and was thus passed unanimously. With the enforcing of this amendment, Pakistan's system of government was shifted from Semi-presidential system to Parliamentary democratic republic system. The amendment removed Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution, which gave the President the power to :dissolve the National Assembly in his discretion where, in his opinion ... a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary. In Pakistan, once legislators are elected to national or provincial assemblies, the people cannot recall them before the end of their five-year terms. In the past, this has contributed to a sense of immunity on the part of members of the ruling party, and to a public perception of rampant corruption among leading politicians - in 1997, Pakistan received the second-worst score in the world on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. A few months later, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, which subjected Members of Parliament to very strict party discipline by giving party leaders unlimited power to dismiss legislators who failed to vote as directed. This virtually eliminated any chance of a Prime Minister of being thrown out of office by a motion of no confidence. The amendments removed nearly all institutional checks and balances on the Prime Minister's power, by effectively removing the legal remedies by which he could be dismissed. Nawaz Sharif's government became increasingly unpopular after the passage of these amendments, even though it was the election of his Pakistan Muslim League by a heavy majority that enabled him to alter the Constitution in the first place. A few months later, Nawaz Sharif's partisan stormed the Supreme Court of Pakistan and forced the resignation of the Chief Justice. This strengthened the perception that the country was becoming a civilian dictatorship. In 1999, the Pakistan Army General Pervez Musharraf assumed power in a military-led bloodless coup. Among the reasons he gave for doing so were the destruction of institutional checks and balances, and the prevailing corruption in the political leadership. The coup was widely welcomed in Pakistan. Amongst the Opposition, ex-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was one of the first leaders to congratulate General Pervez Musharraf for removing Nawaz Sharif. The Supreme Court later validated the removal on the grounds that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments resulted in a situation for which there was no constitutional remedy. In October 2002, elections were held in Pakistan. In December 2003, Parliament passed the Seventeenth Amendment, which partially restored the President's reserve power to dissolve Parliament and thus remove the Prime Minister from office, but made it subject to Supreme Court approval.

Ryerson in 1944. Stanley Br√©haut Egerton Ryerson (March 12, 1911 ‚Äì 25 Apr 1998) was a Canadian historian, educator, political activist. His parents were Edward Stanley Ryerson and Tessie De Vigne, a well-off middle- class family in Toronto. Ryerson could trace his paternal lineage back to Egerton Ryerson, a leading Methodist in nineteenth century Toronto. His grandmother, Emily Eliza Beatty, was a sister-in-law to William McDougall, one of the Fathers of Confederation; and, on his mother's side, he was related to Louis Antoine Br√©haut de l'Isle, French Commander at Trois-Rivi√®res in 1638. Ideological origins To fully understand his commitment to communism one must look towards his period of study at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1931. While attending classes towards a Diplomes d'Etudes Superieures with a thesis on the writings of Sicilian peasant-realist novelist Giovanni Verga, Ryerson involved himself in communist activities. While travelling through Europe, he experienced the political turmoil within Spain and Italy during the early depression years, and while in Paris he took part in the funeral procession of the last survivor of the Paris Commune of 1871 a Z. Camelinat. On this day in 1932, while marching with 200,000 others to P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, Ryerson felt a fierce wave of connection with the French Left. His experiences in Europe affected his vision of the capitalist world and he would write: \\"the realization that the cultural values of art and literature were being turned by capitalism into what I can only describe as spiritual onanism and the discovery that communism, by solving the material problems of society, was the only path to a future creative renaissance, was the first impulse.\\" Europe was the scene of his birth as a communist; Canada was the scene of his growth into a renowned historian and communist intellectual. In the Communist Party Stanley B. Ryerson (top right) with other Canadian Communist leaders in 1942. The Communist Party of Canada, at least in the 1930s and 40s lacked a connection to the Canadian middle class as well as intellectuals; with his return to Canada, Ryerson would become a symbol of the party's appeal to this segment of society. Ryerson \\"was not the only traditional intellectual to join the CPC, but he was one of the first and undoubtedly was to become the most important.\\" The Communist parties of Great Britain and the United States of America, as well as many other nations, could count numerous artists and intellectuals as members from the 1930s on; but in Canada, Ryerson was a lonely figure. His position within the CPC, including his rapid rise in the party hierarchy and his presence on the Central Committee (CC) until 1969, was assured by his unique position; a position that allowed him to play a role within the \\"political history of Canadian Communism unlike that of his American and British counterparts.\\" He was a middle class school boy from a privileged background in an overwhelmingly proletarian organisation, and as such his presence within the CPC did not always meet with approval. But, his education made him an asset for the party, one that would come in handy in the years to come. Marxist historian Ryerson's major contribution was as a Marxist historian and it was here that Ryerson was to find his voice. The Canadian bourgeoisie's dismissal of Communism generally states that it is an alien importation and as such has no basis within Canadian society. By stressing the progressive nature of the Canadian past, the CPC hoped to prove the validity of its existence within Canadian society. During this period, numerous articles and pamphlets were published by the CPC, but it was not until the 1937 publication of Stanley Ryerson's 1837: The Birth of Canadian Democracy, that the full Marxist analysis of the on the 1837 Rebellions would appear. 1837 should be viewed as a work of Marxist historiography written for a working-class audience and not for academia; since Ryerson wrote this book so it could be used as a weapon in the struggle of working people to build a qualitatively different and better world. Ryerson's rationale for writing this book, as was the rationale for all his works, can be best summarised as an exploration of Canadian history with the hopes of educating the working-class, in a sense it was an exercise in the raising of class consciousness. The choice of the title for this book is in itself an interesting by-product of the 1930s Popular Front activities of the CPC. Dedicated to the soldiers of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion fighting in the Spanish Civil War in defence of Republican Spain, this book was written in the hope of redefining the context of revolution. Ryerson referred to the cause of 1837 as the cause of democracy; his decision to place the word in the title of his book, was done with the hope of suggesting that this referred \\"to both bourgeois liberalism that will supplant the remnants of feudal oligarchy and the ultimate vision of equality in the classless society brought about by the proletarian revolution.\\" Doyle contended it was Ryerson's aim to redefine \\"democracy,\\" and the way in which we refer to the events of 1837 and the idea of revolution in general. In leadership Following the outlawing of the CPC in 1940, General Secretary Tim Buck along with Sam Carr and Charles Sims fled Canada for the safety of New York where they would reside under the protection of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA). The leadership of the now underground party was placed in the hands of an Operations Centre, which was headed by Stewart Smith, Leslie Morris, and Stanley Ryerson. This new leadership decided upon a slogan for the CPC's anti-war protests: \\"Withdraw from the British Empire.\\" Signalling a more radical approach to their anti- Imperialist protesting, the Operations Centre authorised Stanley Ryerson to write and publish two pamphlets in Quebec. French-Canada, A Nation in Bondage and French-Canada and the War, described the French Canada as a subjugated nation held in colonial slavery to English Canadian rulers, who were acting as surrogates for the real rulers in Britain. This new approach to the issue of French Canada enabled Ryerson to develop close contacts among important nationalists who opposed the war. With the German invasion of the Soviet Union in July, 1941 the CPC's stance on the war changed quickly. Now that they supported the war, Tim Buck called Ryerson, Smith, and Morris before a CC meeting held on January 22 and 23, 1943. During this meeting, Buck assailed the position of Ryerson, which had become the position of the CPC during their anti-war period. According to Buck, \\"English-Canada as a nation does not oppress French-Canada, nor impose inequality upon it. The national inequality from which the workers and farmers of Quebec suffer, is a heritage of the past.\\" Attitude towards French Canada Later that year, the Communist Party, re-constituted as the Labor-Progressive Party, published Ryerson's French Canada: A Study in Canadian Democracy. Within the pages of French Canada, Ryerson set out his vision of their continuous fight for freedom in the face of colonial servitude. He also emphasised the common aims of French and English Canadians in the pursuit of freedom in the capitalist and colonial systems. Although researched and mostly written while Ryerson was occupied with the direction of the underground party, French Canada was a careful and provocative analysis of Quebec's social and political history. French Canada aimed at encouraging the development of a sense of national pride and unity among Canadians during the years of World War II. Ryerson put forth a socio- economic analysis of the Quebec and in turn educated most English-speaking Canadians about a region they knew very little about. As a sequel to 1837, Ryerson's French Canada revealed \\"the militant spirit of democracy among French Canadians\\" in the hopes of uniting \\"them with their Anglophone compatriots.\\" Ryerson did follow a certain \\"great man\\" approach to history when, in the early chapters, he emphasized the heroes \\"who struggled for self- determination and/or Canadian unity\\"; this approach was complemented by an emphasis on \\"the Quebec masses and their rise out of feudal subjugation toward political power.\\" Very much the Historical Materialist, Ryerson viewed the previous administrations of Quebec as working with representatives of English Canada and international capitalism to keep Quebec in economic subservience. Ryerson believed, \\"The Toronto Tory and the Quebec corporatist meet on common ground: hostility to the democratic peoples' movement, [and] denial of our democratic heritage.\\" Following on his contentions laid out in 1837, Ryerson viewed the failure of English Canada to recognise their connection to French Canada and to fight hand in hand for the fullest democratic rights of the minority nation only served to deepen the power of reactionary influences and limit Canadian democracy and unity in general. French Canada was a by-product of World War II and should be viewed as such. It was full of optimism about the prospects of an Allied victory in the war against international fascism and a transformed world capable of bringing about the complete elimination of the conditions that gave rise to fascism and to the prospect of war. Although this book is full of optimism about a possible future world, Ryerson did not envision a Communist future for Canada and instead placed the LPP as an important part of post-war Canada, but not a defining movement or a dominant party. Ryerson's vision did not come to pass, but his analysis of the political perspicacity of working-class Quebec was groundbreaking as it came during a time when most writers tended to view \\"Quebec as either a quaint or lamentable anachronism.\\" French Canada gave its readers a remarkably modern and hopeful image of French-Canadian society. Intellectual evolution For Ryerson, an understanding of social relations was paramount if one was to garner an understanding of history; his encounter with Innis's materialism led Ryerson to the charge that equated Marxism and economic determinism. He wrote \\"Marxism holds that it is the people who make history-their labor and their struggles and their dreams; and that these are understandable and have meaning when seen in their real setting‚Ä¶.\\" He added, \\"Labor, production, the real relationships of living society: this is the point of departure for historical materialism‚Ä¶.Thought and feelings, ideas and passion and imagination have their being in a material world, are conditioned by it, work upon it.\\" Ryerson's approach to history is that of a man who sees the struggles and ideas of people as the driving force behind history. He did not believe they operate within a vacuum but within a given social system. Ryerson recognised the interplay of freedom and necessity within the development of history \\"as it is in the best Marxist historical writing.\\" Following on the tradition of viewing his writings as a mode of class consciousness, The Founding of Canada was written very much as a popular Marxist introduction to Canadian History. This book offered very little new material and was instead more of a shifting in emphasis for Ryerson. This shift in emphasis stemmed primarily from Ryerson's interest in prehistory and Soviet anthropology; this shift in emphasis is best illustrated by the six chapters on pre-European-contact Canada. This work was not a complete shift of emphasis; Ryerson still dealt with the issue of exploitation and freedom. He believed \\"[t]he weight of 'official' historiography has hitherto been heavily on the side of efforts to smother the facts of exploitation,\\" and because of this \\"[t]he idyllic patriarchal picture of these times that has become traditional, is a piece of flagrant deception.\\" Unequal Union has been seen as the more adventuresome of these two works. It focused on only 60 years, rather than the 300-year scope of The Founding of Canada, and it discussed more deeply the events after the War of 1812 leading up to the expansion of confederation in 1870. In this work, Ryerson turned to an analysis of land and land-holding as he recognises the importance of land to the colonial ruling-class. Gregory Kealey felt Ryerson overextended himself in his argument that the land-monopoly represented a \\"sort of commercialised feudalism\\" which \\"loomed as the dominating problem before the Canadas.\\" But Ryerson's analysis of the 1837 Rebellions held true for Kealey, as he agrees with the classical Marxist formulation, that \\"potential production forces were stifled by dominant property relations; and as long as the latter couldn't be broken down progress remained illusory.\\" Therefore, the rebellions of 1837 were an effort to break the \\"rule of a landlord-merchant oligarchy,\\" blocking the development of industrial capitalism. Analysis of nation and class Ryerson showed how the concepts of \\"nation\\" and \\"class\\", as used by Marxist historians, can aide in an understanding of Canadian problems. He did not attempt to place Canadian history into a preconceived framework of ideas. Instead, he sought to bring the role of 'class' and 'nation', and persons and personalities, into the forefront of discussion instead of allowing them \\"to disappear behind a cloud of economic factors.\\" For Ryerson, the complexities and contradictions of Canadian history can be best analysed through the lens of class conflict rather than idealistic theses of most bourgeois historians. Throughout these two volumes, Ryerson emphasised the state of subjugation inherent within both French and English colonial administrators. This two volume work, Ryerson explained modestly, was intended as \\"a preliminary breaking of ground, suggesting a line of approach to a re-interpretation of this country's history\\". These volumes are more scholarly in style and documentation, as they were \\"addressed less to a working-class readership and more to academic historians and other well-informed readers.\\" The notion of Freedom has been of paramount concern for Ryerson, whether it is the freedom of French Canadians or the freedom of the working class in general, Ryerson has consistently built his arguments on the notion of freedom. In his philosophical work, The Open Society: Paradox and Challenge, published in 1965 outside of the CPC's press, Ryerson discussed his vision of an open and free society. The crux of his argument is found in the issue of freedom; he saw the past as \\"an evolution of people in society, marked by harsh conflict of contending classes and national forces, generating a progression toward greater freedom.\\" The driving force behind all of society is the nature of class existence and each struggle the oppressed class wages brings it closer to freedom. According to Ryerson, and many other Marxist thinkers, the ability to breakthrough to a more open society will come about from the \\"dispelling of the fog of false consciousness, [the] gaining for ourselves a true recognition of the real nature of the existing social structure.\\" Academic career Ryerson paid a price for his commitment to the CPC and his analysis of Canadian history. Upon his return to Canada from his studies in Europe, he took up party work in August 1934 in Montreal where he taught French studies at Sir George Williams University. Ryerson had been working very closely with the CPC and in 1935 he was elected to the Central Committee (CC) and was elected provincial secretary in 1936. He held his position at the College for three years until his secret was discovered; all the while working and writing under the pseudonym of E. Roger to protect his job, his politics would lead to his eventual non-renewal in 1937. Ryerson's next academic position would not come for 35 years, a year after he parted company with the CPC, he would accept a position in the History department at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, and \\"at age 58, he commenced the academic career he had sacrificed in the 1930s.\\" Breaking with the Party His decision to leave the CPC in 1971 was primarily based upon his experiences within the Party from 1956 (the year of the Hungarian Revolution) up to, and after, the Soviet invasion of Prague in 1968. During his 35-year tenure in the CPC, Ryerson was routinely asked to augment his historical writings in order to meet the prevailing philosophy at the time. After the internal party crisis between 1956 and 1957, Ryerson was forced to write an article stating his previous books and articles had given \\"a rather idealised treatment of the bourgeois democrats Lafontaine and Baldwin.\\" Blaming this on \\"liberalism,\\" he essentially turned his back on his earlier beliefs concerning 1837 and sought to align himself with the new revisionist tendencies within the CPC that came about during the post-Stalin debate. Ryerson's beliefs concerning Marxism-Leninism differed greatly from that of the CPC of the late 1950s and early 1960s. His vision was brought to the forefront when in his article In France: \\"The Week of Marxist Thought\\", he agreed with the leader of the French Communist party who argued: ::that among the shoals to avoid, ‚Ä¶, is the narrow, 'cramped conception of Marxism-Leninism simply as a position to be defended, a fortress to be held, with every portcullis closed while one peers out over the battlements at all who are not 'our people' wandering on the distant plain' This sentiment did resonate with the leadership of General Secretary Leslie Morris, who viewed the sentiments of the Popular Front in a much more favourable light than would be seen under the leadership of William Kashtan; it was under the stifling leadership of Kashtan that Ryerson made his final break with the CPC. Views on Ryerson The general criticism of Ryerson is that his work continually failed to transcend the CPC's ideological passivity when it came to their relationship with Moscow. Kealey sees these arguments as being based upon a belief that Ryerson's understanding of Marxism was severely limited by the many Stalinist distortions people generally see in Soviet philosophy disseminated during Ryerson's time in the CPC. It is true, that party work affected his intellectual work; his choice of material was in many respects dictated by the political atmosphere of the day. But, this does not mean he substituted party beliefs for his own in every respect. Ryerson was a dedicated Communist, who saw within the CPC the best vehicle for advancing the cause of Communism and the betterment of the working-class. His decision to follow the general line, and in some instances deny his true beliefs, is unfortunate but should not be viewed from outside of their historical realities. During the era of the Popular Front, Ryerson wrote in a manner that befell that era and during the time of the Democratic Front he stridently put forth arguments seeking the destruction of Fascism as it was, in his eyes, the best way forward for the working-class. The removal of Ryerson from his intellectual and historical \\"context denies him recognition as the major pioneer of Marxist historical writing in Canada;\\" and it also denies the very nature of Ryerson and his role in Canadian society. As a Party intellectual, he was in the minority when compared to other communist parties in the world; but, his dedication to a Marxist analysis of History and Canadian society was unsurpassed within the CPC. His early education was founded on the study of literature, but his time in Paris in the early 1930s would forever change his life and transform him into an Organic Intellectual of the working-class. His rationale for delving into historical and political writing can be found within the pages of Open Society. In reading 1837, French Canada, The Founding of Canada, and Unequal Union, we, the reader, find Ryerson's journey to \\"dispel the fog of false consciousness\\". At the very heart of his writings, are the class struggle and the raising of class consciousness through the written word.

It joins the cities of Dubuque, Iowa, and East Dubuque, Illinois. The bridge is part of U.S. Route 20 (US 20). It is one of two automobile bridges over the Mississippi in the area (the Dubuque‚ÄìWisconsin Bridge north links Dubuque with Wisconsin), and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. History For a number of years, people living in the area wanted a bridge to replace the old bridge, which was called either the \\"High Bridge\\" or the \\"Wagon Bridge.\\" However, economic conditions at the time made it difficult to get the financing together to build a new bridge. Julien Dubuque Bridge, Oct. 2008 Julien Dubuque Bridge, July 2010 During World War II, a new bridge became even more important as it would help facilitate military transportation. In 1942, the first parts of the bridge were begun. In 1943, the bridge was completed. It was painted gray to help camouflage the bridge in case of enemy attack. Because the bridge was financed with bonds, it initially operated as a toll bridge. Proceeds were used to help pay off the bonds. In the post-war years, traffic was so heavy the bonds were paid off 11 years early, and the bridge became toll-free in 1954. In the early 1990s, the bridge underwent an extensive renovation. The deck was replaced, and a new walkway was installed. For many years, the bridge was a dark green color; however in more recent times it again has been painted a light gray color. Prior to the construction of the Dubuque-Wisconsin Bridge, the Julien Dubuque Bridge also carried US 61 and US 151\\\\. This resulted in both of these highways passing a short distance through Jo Daviess County, Illinois, between Dubuque and Wisconsin. Now both highways cross the Mississippi on the Dubuque‚ÄìWisconsin Bridge, which directly connects Wisconsin and Iowa, and neither US 61 nor US 151 passes through Illinois. 2008 barge collision On June 9, 2008, the bridge was struck by a number of runaway barges shortly after 8 p.m. Fifteen barges‚Äîwhich were loaded with corn, soybeans, and iron ore‚Äîstruck one of the pillars on the eastern side of the main channel. Unsure of whether the bridge was stable, authorities temporarily closed it until an inspection could be performed. Traffic was rerouted on to the Dubuque‚ÄìWisconsin Bridge a few miles to the north. On June 10 the Iowa Department of Transportation inspected the bridge and determined that it was safe for traffic. By 2:30 p.m. they had reopened the bridge to traffic. Authorities believe rapid currents present in the Mississippi River caused the barges to come loose and strike the bridge. The pilot and crew of the barge tested negative for alcohol intoxication, and foul play was not suspected in this case. Future Downtown Dubuque with Julien Dubuque Bridge in background Over the years, there has been considerable debate about the future of the bridge. Much of this debate centers on having a four-lane connection with Illinois. The debate has produced several options, * Expand the existing bridge to support four lanes. * Build a second two-lane bridge next to the existing bridge, and have traffic one way on each bridge. * Build a new four-lane bridge south of the Julien Dubuque Bridge, and leave the current bridge intact as an attraction or as a bridge for local traffic. * Tear down the Julien Dubuque Bridge, and replace it with a four-lane bridge that looks similar to the current bridge. Most officials have indicated they would rather not do anything that detracts from the historically important bridge. Discussion about expansion of the bridge continues. While no firm plans have yet been made, officials are leaning towards building another bridge adjacent to the existing bridge.

It was created in 1982 as the mass-market car manufacturing subsidiary of British Leyland (BL). Previously, this entity had been known as BL Cars Ltd (formerly Leyland Cars) which encompassed the Austin-Morris and Jaguar-Rover-Triumph divisions of British Leyland. After a major restructuring of BL's car manufacturing operations, Jaguar regained its independence (leading to its eventual de-merger in 1984) whilst the Triumph and Morris marques were retired. The new, leaner car business was rechristened as the Austin Rover Group and focused primarily on the Austin and Rover marques. The Morris and Triumph marques continued briefly within ARG until 1984 when both were dropped. In 1989, two years after the Austin brand was also discontinued, ARG assumed the name of its parent company Rover Group plc, from which point the two entities were generally considered one and the same, although they continued to be legally separate - Rover Group plc was a holding company also owned Land Rover following the divestment of Unipart and Leyland Trucks, whilst Rover Group Limited was the mass market car manufacturing business. History Rover 213SE 1986 Rover 820Si Following the financial collapse of the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC) in 1975 and the stark Ryder Report on the ailing firm, the resulting government bail-out and nationalisation saw the company being renamed to British Leyland (BL).Alan Pilkington, Transforming Rover, Renewal against the Odds, 1981‚Äì94, (1996), Bristol Academic Press, Bristol, pp.199, The car manufacturing subsidiary of BL became Leyland Cars, and later BL Cars Ltd, and it was this entity which ultimately became Austin Rover. The Leyland name had become tainted by the industrial unrest and poor quality cars of the 1970s, and the creation of the Austin Rover brand was intended to present a new public face of the company, although at corporate level it was still known as \\"BL plc\\". However, the huge industrial relations problems, ineffectual management and product duplication that had plagued the company up to the nationalisation continued throughout the late 1970s. The problems centred on Longbridge union leader and shop steward Derek Robinson (nicknamed \\"Red Robbo\\" by the British press). Robinson had assumed a greater level of control over BL than any of its senior managers, and his network of union leaders in the various BL plants had the power to end production if he had instructed them to do so. The Labour government of the time ran out of patience with Robinson, and appointed South African-born corporate troubleshooter Sir Michael Edwardes to turn BL around. His first task was to curb the large amount of power that the trade unions had over the company. After discovering Robinson's links with various communist groups, the company amassed sufficient evidence claiming that his actions were intended to deliberately damage both BL itself and the UK economy. As a result of this, he was dismissed in 1979. Secondly, Edwardes began a ruthless programme of factory closures and sell-offs. The biggest casualties of this were the MG assembly plant in Abingdon, and the Triumph plants in Speke (Liverpool) and Canley (Coventry). BL pulled out of entire markets ‚Äì for example the large Leyland tractors range was sold-off wholesale to Marshall, and Jaguar was privatised in 1984. Many of BL's non-core subsidiaries (such as refrigerator company Prestcold and industrial engine manufacturer Coventry Climax) were also culled during Edwardes' tenure. Thirdly, he entered into a collaborative agreement with Honda, the first product of this alliance being the Triumph Acclaim, which paved the way for the joint development of a range of cars which spearheaded the company's revival in the 1980s and 1990s. Lastly, the number of BL dealerships in the UK was trimmed down drastically. The new, slimmer British Leyland was organised into a series of groups. Austin Rover handled the mass production of cars, with the smallest and cheapest models being sold under the Austin brand, while the more upmarket models carried a Rover badge. High performance version of the Austin hatchbacks and saloons made use of a revived MG badge. Light commercial vehicle production (4x4s and vans) was managed by the Land Rover Group, whilst full-size commercial vehicles were built by Leyland Trucks and Leyland Bus. The luxury manufacturer Jaguar was demerged from BL in 1984 and privatized, later taken over by Ford in 1989, and was ultimately reunited with former BL stablemate Land Rover in 2000 to form what is now Jaguar Land Rover. Sales of Austin Rover products were reasonably strong, though not quite as high as the sales achieved by some of the earlier British Leyland products ‚Äì the Maestro and Montego for instance did not sell as well as their predecessors, the Austin Allegro and Morris Marina, despite being fundamentally superior vehicles for their time. The Austin/MG Metro was regularly among the top five selling cars in Britain throughout the 1980s, and for two years in the early part of the decade it was the best selling supermini in Britain. The Metro, which was launched in 1980, gave the firm a much-needed competitor in modern supermini market and filled a gap in the range vacated by a scaling down of Mini and Austin Allegro production. At its peak in 1983, the Metro was Britain's third best selling car with more than 130,000 sales. The Austin Maestro, launched in March 1983, was initially very popular, but sales dipped towards the end of the decade and in 1989 it was the 19th best selling new car in the UK with less than 40,000 sales, having peaked in 1984 at more than 80,000 sales as Britain's sixth best selling car. This was less of a problem thanks to the follow-up of the Triumph Acclaim with the first generation Rover 200 of 1984 ‚Äì the second product of the Honda alliance and one of the few strong-selling small family saloons of its era. So in effect, Austin Rover was selling around 100,000 cars of this size every year in Britain during the mid to late 1980s, regaining its share of the sector after the scaling-down of Austin Allegro production from 1980. The similarly sized Austin Maxi had already been discontinued in 1981 to allow the Triumph Acclaim to take over its production lines. The Austin Montego went on sale in April 1984 and sold well, being Britain's seventh best selling car in 1985 and 1986, though it was unable to match the sales success of the sector's established favourites ‚Äì the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier. The car had been in the pipeline since the late 1970s when the company's main competitors in this sector were the Morris Marina and Princess, but the Montego actually replaced the Morris Ital and Austin Ambassador which were the respective facelifted versions of those two cars. Austin Rover's executive car, the Rover 800, was launched in July 1986 as the third product of its venture with Honda, sharing its development with the Honda Legend. This car also sold well, being a popular competitor for the likes of the Ford Granada and Vauxhall Carlton. It was also sold in America under the Sterling brand, but this project was quickly shelved due to unacceptable product quality issues that led to low sales. Austin Rover's decision not to replace sports cars like the MG MGB and Triumph TR7 was justified by the fact that sports cars were no longer popular in the early 1980s, and many other manufacturers had also stopped ‚Äì or were about to stop ‚Äì production of sports coupes and roadsters. Buyers were instead being guided to \\"hot hatchbacks\\", following a trend set by the Volkswagen Golf GTI since 1976. By 1985, Austin Rover had launched a line-up of performance variants of its Metro and Maestro hatchbacks and the Montego saloon. These cars were badged as MG models and proved popular, especially in the form of the MG Metro. MG models accounted for approximately 10% of Metro, Maestro and Montego production between 1982 and 1991. The Rover Group continued production of the MG Metro until 1990 when it was replaced by the Rover Metro GTi. MG Maestro and Montego production continued at Cowley until 1991, when these models were discontinued to make way for the GTi variants of the Rover 200 and 400. However, the last Maestro and Montego models survived in production until December 1994, just before the 200 and 400 ranges - which had been expected to replace them - were themselves replaced. Consolidation and renaming In 1986, Austin Rover's parent company, BL plc, was renamed \\"Rover Group\\", and the truck and bus businesses were subsequently demerged and sold off to DAF and Volvo, respectively. The spare parts and logistics arm Unipart was also spun out in 1987. After an abortive attempt in 1988 to divest Land Rover to General Motors, the entire Rover Group was sold off by the British government in 1988 to British Aerospace. The car making subsidiary Austin Rover Group Ltd was renamed \\"Rover Group Ltd\\", which saw the effective disappearance of the Austin Rover name and brand, even though the Austin badging had been removed from the Mini, Metro, Maestro and Montego models after 1987. By 1991, all Austin Rover dealer signage had been changed to the new claret and beige \\"Rover\\" branding, and use of the old blue and green \\"chevron\\" logo had ceased, although it made sporadic appearances on the cars themselves (see below). The combine now known as Rover Group remained in BAe ownership until January 1994, when it was sold to BMW. It remained in BMW ownership for six years before being sold to the \\"Phoenix Consortium\\" in May 2000, incorporating the MG and Rover marques and becoming MG Rover, which lasted five years before going bankrupt. The ownership of the Mini brand, however, remained in BMW ownership, as did ownership of the Cowley factory, which began production of an all-new Mini in the summer of 2001. Land Rover, meanwhile was sold to Ford, who had already purchased Jaguar in 1989. MG production was revived in 2007 by new owner Nanjing Automobile, while the rights to use the Rover marque were purchased by Ford in 2006, only to be transferred to ownership of Indian carmaker Tata in 2008, as Tata also took over Land Rover and Jaguar to form Jaguar Land Rover. The Rover marque has yet to be revived more than a decade after its demise that was brought about by the collapse of MG Rover. Branding and logo In 1968 British Leyland had created Austin Morris Ltd as an operating company that managed all the previous operations of the British Motor Corporation which it had absorbed, but it was not until 1978 that Austin-Morris was given a formal corporate identity (distinct from the Jaguar Rover Triumph (JRT) arm of the company) with the blue and green \\"chevron\\" logo (officially known as the \\"wing\\"), which began appearing on Austin and Morris- badged BL cars in that year - the Princess 2 and the van/pick-up versions of the Morris Marina were the first vehicles to wear the logo. However, this separate branding strategy was later abandoned and by 1983 the chevron would be later expanded to represent virtually all of BL's marques and business activities in the public domain, eventually supplanting BL's own roundel logo (affectionately known as the \\"plughole\\") and would ultimately become the logo of the entire Austin Rover Group. The ARG chevron officially remained in use until 1988, when ARG's rename and reprivatisation into the Rover Group saw it gradually disappear. The Austin name was retired after 1987, however the logo still appeared on the badging of the former Austin models, and the VIN plates of the cars still read \\"Austin Rover Group Ltd\\", since this was still the manufacturer's official name until 1989. For that model year the chevron logo was finally dropped in favour of a black silhouetted version of the Rover \\"longship\\" badge upon which the model name (Metro, Maestro, Montego) was applied, although with the exception of the reengineered R6 Metro of 1990, the Rover name was never officially used for these models. One interesting anomaly from the ARG era is that the chevron logo was stamped into thousands of BL/Rover Group vehicle components, many of which survived on Rover and Land Rover models into the 21st century; indeed there are still some components - most notably on the Land Rover Defender until it finished production in 2016 - which still bear both it and some still even bear the older BL roundel logo. A number of new models were in development at the time that Austin Rover Group ceased to exist - including the second generation Rover 200 Series, launched in October 1989 and the new Metro which was launched in May 1990.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town and a locality in the Shire of Paroo, Queensland, Australia. It is south of Charleville, and approximately west of the state capital, Brisbane. In the , Cunnamulla had a population of 1,140 people. Geography Cunnamulla lies on the Warrego River in South West Queensland within the Murray-Darling drainage basin. It flows from the north (Coongoola) through the town, which is in the centre of the locality, and exits to the south (Tuen). The Mitchell Highway passes through the locality from north (Coongoola) to south (Tuen), while the Balonne Highway enters the location from the east (Linden). The two highways intersect in the town, which is located in the centre of the locality. The Bulloo Developmental Road starts in Cunnamulla and exists the locality to the west (Eulo). Cunnamulla is the administrative centre for the Paroo Shire, which also includes the townships of Wyandra, Yowah and Eulo, and covers an area of . Major industries of the area are wool, pig and kangaroo hunting, and the hospitality industry. History Gunya (also known as Kunya, Kunja, Kurnja) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Gunya people. The Gunya language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Paroo Shire Council, taking in Cunnamulla and extending north towards Augathella, east towards Bollon and west towards Thargomindah. The original Indigenous inhabitants of the area were the Kunja. The area's first European explorer was Thomas Mitchell who passed through the region in 1846. The town name Cunnamulla is named after a pastoral property established in 1867, which in turn is the Aboriginal name of a deep waterhole in the Warrego River. A settlement arose here because there was a reliable waterhole where two major stock routes intersected. The town itself came into being in the late 19th century as a coach stop for Cobb and Co coaches. A town survey was conducted in 1868, the same year a courthouse was built. Cunnamulla Post Office opened on 1 March 1868. Cunnamulla Provisional School opened on 9 July 1877, becoming Cunnamulla State School in 1885. From 1885 when the railway was constructed to Bourke in New South Wales, farmers at Cunnamulla and other parts of south- western Queensland began to send their wool to markets via Bourke rather than the Charleville, then the terminus of the Western railway line in Queensland, as the New South Wales Government offered more competitive rail freight rates than the Queensland Government. Queensland Railway Commissioner James Thallon responded by negotiating with the Carrier's Union which carried goods to the Charleville railhead to make the cost of transporting the goods via Charleville more attractive. However, strikes by the carriers in support of the 1891 Australian shearers' strike meant that goods continued to be travel via New South Wales, further encouraged by new lower freight rates in New South Wales announced in June 1893. The Queensland Government responded the following month by introducing the Railway Border Tax Act which taxed wool and sheepskins crossing the border into New South Wales to make it too expensive to freight the wool via New South Wales. However, this could only be a temporary measure as the anticipated Federation of Australia would likely include free trade between the states of Australia removing the ability to tax goods at the border crossing. Therefore, on 3 December 1895, the Queensland Parliament approved the construction of the extension of the Western railway line from Charleville to Cunnamulla. During the construction of the railway line, there was a dispute over the location of the railway station at Cunnamulla. The original proposal was for the station to be to the north of the town to be above the flood level rather than within the town centre as was usual practice. However, the railway chief engineer Henry Charles Stanley visited Cunnamulla and decided it would be better to place the station in the centre of the town as it would be more convenient and better positioned for crossing the Warrego River when the railway line was further extended. However, the disadvantage of the town centre site was that it would encroach on the town's cricket ground. The townsfolk were divided on the issue and many sent petitions to the government to demand one location or the other. The Queensland Parliament eventually decided to proceed with the original location north of the town. The railway line to Cunnamulla was opened on 10 October 1898. However, the hotel on the corner of John and Louise Streets in the centre of the town had already been named the Railway Hotel in anticipation of a town-centre station and retained that name until the 1970s, when it was renamed Trappers Inn. A Catholic church opened in Cunnamulla in May 1894. The Bush Brotherhood of St Paul has provided pastoral care to Cunnamulla since 1905. The Sacred Heart Primary School was opened in 1915 by the Sisters of Mercy. St Edmund's Anglican church was dedicated on 22 October 1960 by Archbishop Reginald Halse. Its closure on 28 May 2003 was approved by Venerable G. F. Harch, Archdeacon of the West. In 1999 the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Policy and Development reported that Cunnamulla's indigenous community suffered from a high level of domestic violence stemming from an over reliance by the police and the courts on punishment and detention to deal with Indigenous offenders. p47 The Cunnamulla library underwent a major refurbishment in 2013. Flooding The town has experienced major flooding in 1990, 1997, 2010 and 2012. The 1990 flood set a record for the Warrego River at . In 2008, the Australian Defence Force was deployed to assist in flood preparations. An high levee protects the town.

Barton Randle, preached the first sermon on Iowa soil on November 6, 1833. First services were held in 1833 in a multipurpose log cabin building in what is now Washington Square. Subsequent buildings were built in 1834 (also in what is now Washington Square), 1839 (across the street), 1853 (on Main Street between 11th and 12th Streets), and the current building at the corner of 12th and Main Streets. The present church was built in 1896, and the congregation began worshiping in the building in 1897. The church is noted for their collection of over 100 Tiffany Stained glass windows. It has been called \\"one of the five finest Religious Tiffany collections in the world.\\" The Angel in the window of the Angel among the Lilies is rumored to bear the likeness of the young deceased daughter of the people who had sponsored that particular window. Since 1990, the church has made an effort to restore and preserve these windows. The pipe organ in the church is also of historic interest. When the Farand and Votey organ was purchased, two train cars were required to bring the parts to Dubuque. Because the train could not get across the river, barges than were used to float the parts over so that they could be installed in the church. The organ has about 1,000 pipes. At the time of installation, it was one of the largest organs in the area, however over the years it has been eclipsed by others. The pipe organ contains 36 ranks or pipes, about 2,200 total and was restored in 1992 by the Fowler Organ Company, Lansing, Mi.

A member of seven National League (NL) champions from to inclusive, Furillo batted over .300 five times, winning the batting title, with a .344 average ‚Äî then the highest by a right-handed hitting Dodger since 1900. Noted for his strong and accurate throwing arm, he recorded 10 or more assists in nine consecutive seasons, leading the league twice, and retired with the fifth-most games in right field (1,408) in NL history. Early years, minor league baseball Furillo was born in Stony Creek Mills, Pennsylvania. He left school in the eighth grade, and often felt awkward among his teammates as a result; they would later recall that he rarely socialized with players who were better-educated. He signed with the Reading, Pennsylvania, team in the Interstate League, earning one of his nicknames with his powerful arm; the Dodgers were sufficiently impressed by his ability that they purchased the entire minor league franchise to acquire him. His other nickname, \\"Skoonj\\", came from the Italian word scungilli (\\"snail\\"), which was his favorite dish. Major league career Arriving in the major leagues in , he batted .295 for the NL pennant winners, finishing the year ninth in the league with 88 runs batted in. He was one of the key members on the Dodgers' champions, hitting .322 (4th in the NL) with 18 home runs, and placing among the league's top ten players in RBI (106), slugging average (.506), hits (177), runs (95), triples (10) and total bases (278); he finished sixth in the voting for the MVP Award. In 1950 he batted .305 (7th in the league) with 18 home runs, 106 RBI, and a career-high 99 runs. He achieved a personal best with 197 hits, finishing third in the NL for the second year in a row, for the 1951 team which lost a legendary pennant playoff to the New York Giants; he also batted .295 (9th in the NL) with 91 RBI and 93 runs. In that year he set a team record with 667 at bats, exceeding Ivy Olson's total of 652; Maury Wills broke his mark with 695 in . He became skilled at negotiating balls hit off the high right-field wall at Ebbets Field, and after he led the NL in assists in both 1950 (18) and 1951 (24), opposing runners were increasingly reluctant to challenge his arm. On August 27, 1951, he threw out Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Mel Queen by two feet at first base after Queen had apparently singled into right field. During spring training of 1952, the New York Journal-American called Furillo \\"one of the best players in the game,\\" calling his style one of \\"close mechanical perfection.\\" Furillo batted only .247 for the pennant winners, though he was selected to his first All- Star team. Diagnosed with cataracts, he had surgery in the offseason and returned with perhaps his best season, winning the batting title and collecting 21 home runs and 92 RBI with a career-best 38 doubles (3rd in the NL). His .344 average was the highest by a right-handed Dodgers hitter since Oyster Burns hit .354 in 1894; Tommy Davis would better him with a .346 mark in 1962. He was again named an All-Star, ending the year fifth in the league in slugging (.580), and finished ninth in the MVP balloting. Furillo's season ended on September 6 against the Giants - he was batting against Rub√©n G√≥mez in the second inning, and opposing manager Leo Durocher was yelling for Gomez to \\"stick it in his ear\\"; Furillo was hit on the wrist by a pitch, and proceeded to first base, but with a 3‚Äì2 count on the next batter, Durocher and Furillo charged towards each other. Furillo got Durocher in a headlock, and in the ensuing brawl, Monte Irvin of the Giants stepped on Furillo's hand, fracturing a knuckle on his little finger. For the champions he was seventh in the league with a .314 average, along with 95 RBI and a career high of 26 homers. With the team which repeated as NL champions, earning the team's seventh pennant in ten years, he slipped to a .289 average but maintained solid power totals with 21 homers, 83 RBI and 30 doubles. He hit .306 in the Dodgers' last season in Brooklyn in 1957, and batted .290 in their first year in Los Angeles, finishing eighth in the league with 83 RBI. With the pennant team, his playing time was reduced to only 50 games, with just 25 of them in the outfield. But he had one last highlight in the playoff series against the Milwaukee Braves when he beat out a ground ball in the 12th inning of the second and final game, with Gil Hodges scoring from second base to win the NL flag. Release and controversy The Dodgers released Furillo in May while he was injured with a torn calf muscle; he sued the team, claiming they released him to avoid both the higher pension due a 15-year player and medical expenses, eventually collecting $21,000. He would later maintain that he was blackballed as a result and was unable to find a job within the sport ‚Äì a charge denied by Commissioner Ford Frick. World Series exploits Furillo played in seven World Series with the Dodgers, six of them against the New York Yankees, winning in 1955 and in 1959 against the Chicago White Sox. He had an excellent 1947 World Series, batting .353 in a seven-game loss; he had two RBI and scored a run in a 9‚Äì8 Game 3 victory, and scored the run which gave Brooklyn the lead for good in an 8‚Äì6 win in Game 6. He preserved a 6‚Äì5 victory in Game 5 of the 1952 World Series when he made a spectacular catch over the fence of an apparent home run by Johnny Mize - who had already homered three times in the Series - with one out in the eleventh inning. In the 1953 World Series he hit .333, and drove in the tying run in the seventh inning of Game 1, though Brooklyn went on to lose; in the final Game 6, his 2-run homer with one out in the ninth tied the game 3‚Äì3, but New York scored in the bottom of the inning to win the game and the Series. In the victorious 1955 Series he started the scoring with a solo home run in his first at bat of Game 1, which New York won 6‚Äì5. In Game 7 he advanced Roy Campanella to third base on a groundout in the fourth inning, with Campanella later scoring, and was walked intentionally with one out and runners on second and third in the sixth, with another run following on a sacrifice fly by Hodges. The two runs held up for a 2‚Äì0 victory, and Brooklyn earned the only World Series title in franchise history. In the 1959 Series he was limited to four pinch-hitting appearances and his 2-run single in the seventh inning of Game 3 broke a scoreless tie. Los Angeles held on for a 3‚Äì1 win. Statistical summary In his 15-year career, Furillo batted .299 with 192 home runs, 1,910 hits, 1,058 RBI, 895 runs, 324 doubles, 56 triples, 48 stolen bases, a .458 slugging average and 514 walks for a .355 on-base percentage. As an outfielder, he had 3,322 putouts, 151 assists, 34 double plays and 74 errors for 3,547 total chances and a .979 fielding percentage. If he had one more hit in his career, he would have statistically had a .300 batting average. In 40 World Series games, he batted .266 (34-for-128) with 13 runs, 9 doubles, 2 home runs, 13 RBI and 13 walks. After baseball After retiring as a player, Furillo left the sport for good. While writing his 1972 book The Boys of Summer about the 1952 and 1953 pennant-winning teams, author Roger Kahn located Furillo installing elevators at the World Trade Center. During the mid-1960s, he owned and operated a deli in Flushing, Queens. Furillo later worked as a night watchman; he developed leukemia, and died in Stony Creek Mills, Pennsylvania at 66 years of age of an apparent heart attack. Although Furillo felt that baseball completely forgot about him and his accomplishments, his funeral was attended by many of his Dodger teammates, including hall-of-famers Sandy Koufax and Duke Snider. He is interred at Forest Hills Memorial Park in Reiffton, Pennsylvania. In a 1976 Esquire magazine article, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \\"All Time All-Star Argument Starter\\", consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Furillo was the right fielder on Stein's Italian team.

This amendment made many changes to Pakistan's constitution. Many of these changes dealt with the office of the president and the reversal of the effects of the Thirteenth Amendment. Summarized here are brief descriptions of the major points. *President Musharraf's Legal Framework Order (LFO) was largely incorporated into the constitution, with a few changes. *Article 63(1)(d) of the Constitution to become operative after December 31, 2004. The intent of this was to prohibit a person from holding both a political office (such as that of the president) and an \\"office of profit\\" - an office that is typically held by a career government servant, civil or military - such as the office of the Chief of Army Staff. Although this was supposed to separate the two types of office, a loophole - \\".. other than an office declared by law ..\\" - allowed Parliament to pass an ordinary law later in 2004 - permitting the President to hold on to the office of Chief of Army Staff, an option that President Musharraf then exercised. *Should the President win a majority in a vote of confidence in the electoral college within 30 days of the passage of this amendment, he shall be deemed to be elected to the office of President. (On January 1, 2004, Musharraf won 658 out of 1,170 electoral-college votes - a 56% majority - and was thereby deemed to be elected president.) *The President regains the authority to dissolve the National Assembly - and thus effectively to dismiss the Pakistani Prime Minister - but the power to do so is made subject to an approval or veto by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. *A Governor's power to dissolve a Provincial Assembly is similarly subject to Supreme Court approval or veto. *Article 152A, which dealt with the National Security Council, was annulled. (The legal basis for the NSC is now an ordinary law, the National Security Council Act of 2004.) *Ten laws had been added by the LFO to the Sixth Schedule, which is a list of \\"laws that are not to be altered, repealed or amended without the previous sanction of the President.\\" After this amendment, five of those laws will lose their Sixth Schedule protection after six years. Laws to be unprotected include the four laws that established the system of democratic local governments. (Those in favor of this change have argued that it would enable each province to evolve its own systems. Opponents fear that authoritarian provincial governments could disempower or even dismantle the system of local democracies.)

It is one of a number of tubing types developed by Reynolds. Reynolds 531 \\"was the standard of excellence for many decades\\" among bicycle frame-building materials.Sheldon Brown's bicycle glossary, http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ra-e.html. And because of the availability of a wide range of butting, diameters and thicknesses of tubes, along with different stays and fork blades, it became the tubing of choice for most frame builders.http://www.bretonbikes.com/reynolds.htm Details Reynolds 531 bicycle frame tubes. Introduced in 1935 and for many years at the forefront of alloy steel tubing technology, 531 cycle tubing has been superseded by more complex alloys and heat-treatment/cold-forming cycles as Reynolds continues to compete with other manufacturers of steel for the bicycle industry.Reynolds Technology FAQ, retrieved 23 October 2011, http://reynoldstechnology.biz/faqs/materials/2 531 tubing became the tubing- of-choice for most framebuilders at least partly because of the huge range of butting, diameters and thicknesses of tubes along with different stays and fork blades available - helped by the willingness of Reynolds to make special tubes for certain manufacturers. Reynolds also made up complete 'sets' of tubing for different cycling applications - for example 531c (Competition), 531st (Special Tourist), 531ATB (All Terrain Bike) and so-on. This flexibility made 531 still competitive even after the introduction of more advanced alloys. The widespread use of TIG and MIG welding in cycle manufacture became a problem as 531 reacted poorly to the higher temperatures produced and 531 has been gradually phased out as a result. The most common like-for-like replacements for 531 are Reynolds 520 and 525 - a Chrome-Molybdenum tubing with very similar characteristics, but in addition to brazing, can also be welded. The 520 tubing can often be seen on modern \\"fixie\\" bikes (urban \\"track\\" type bike frames), while the 525 with its thicker-walled seat stays is more for cyclo-cross and touring framesets.

It typically contains vodka, a caesar mix (a blend of tomato juice and clam broth), hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce, and is served with ice in a large, celery salt-rimmed glass, typically garnished with a stalk of celery and wedge of lime. What distinguishes it from a Bloody Mary is the inclusion of clam broth. The cocktail may also be contrasted with the Michelada, which has similar flavouring ingredients but uses beer instead of vodka. It debuted in the Polonaise nightclub in Manhattan in November 1953. Origin The original cocktail of vodka with seasoned tomato and clam juice made its debut at the Polonaise nightclub in Manhattan in November 1953. The drink was introduced as the \\"Smirnoff Smiler\\" by owner Paul Pawlowski. In December 1953, columnist Walter Winchell reported that the drink was seasoned with \\"a dash of Wooooshhhtasheer Sauce\\". In 1959, cartoonist and creator of \\"The Addams family\\", Charles Addams (employed by the New Yorker magazine, a few blocks from the Polonaise nightclub in Manhattan) claimed he invented the \\"Gravel Gertie\\", a cocktail of clam/tomato juice and vodka seasoned with Tabasco sauce. In 1962, Carl La Marca, bar manager at the Baker Hotel in Dallas, invented the \\"Imperial Clam Digger\\", adding a basil garnish and dash of lime to an existing version of the \\"Smirnoff Smiler\\", called the \\"Clam Digger\\". In October 1968, Seagram president Victor Fischel and Mott's Clamato marketer Ray Anrig claimed to have invented the seasoned tomato/clam/vodka cocktail, the \\"Clamdigger\\" earlier in 1968, in Manhattan. Seagram, headquartered 2 blocks from the Polonaise nightclub, filed a trademark application on the name \\"Clamdigger\\" claiming first use on May 31, 1968. From late 1968 to the end of 1969, Seagram and Mott's ran a major advertising promotion of the \\"Clam Digger\\" cocktail recipe in national magazines. The Caesar was invented in 1969 by restaurant manager Walter Chell of the Calgary Inn (today the Westin Hotel) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He devised the cocktail after being tasked to create a signature drink for the Calgary Inn's new Italian restaurant. He mixed vodka with clam and tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, and other spices, creating a drink similar to a Bloody Mary but with a uniquely spicy flavour. Chell said his inspiration came from Italy. He recalled that in Venice, they served Spaghetti alle vongole, spaghetti with tomato sauce and clams. He reasoned that the mixture of clams and tomato sauce would make a good drink, and mashed clams to form a \\"nectar\\" that he mixed with other ingredients. According to Chell's granddaughter, his Italian ancestry led him to call the drink a \\"Caesar\\". The longer name of \\"Bloody Caesar\\" is said to differentiate the drink from the Bloody Mary, but Chell said it was a regular patron at the bar who served as the inspiration. During the three months he spent working to perfect the drink, he had customers sample it and offer feedback. One regular customer, an Englishman, who often ordered the drink said one day \\"Walter, that's a damn good bloody Caesar\\". Popularity Chell said the drink was an immediate hit with the restaurant's patrons, claiming it \\"took off like a rocket\\". Within five years of its introduction, the Caesar had become Calgary's most popular mixed drink. It spread throughout Western Canada, then to the east. Coinciding with its 40th anniversary, a petition was launched in 2009 in the hopes of having the Caesar named the nation's official mixed drink. In Calgary, Mayor Dave Bronconnier celebrated the drink's anniversary by declaring May 13, 2009, as Caesar Day in the city. The Mott's company was independently developing Clamato, a mixture of clam and tomato juices, at the same time the Caesar was invented. Sales of Clamato were initially slow: Mott's sold only 500 cases of Clamato in 1970, but sales consistently increased after the company's distributors discovered Chell's drink. By 1994, 70% of Mott's Clamato sales in Canada were made to mix Caesars, while half of all Clamato sales were made in Western Canada. Motts claims that the Caesar is the most popular mixed drink in Canada, estimating that over 350 million Caesars are consumed every year. In the United States, the Caesar is typically available at bars along the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. Elsewhere, bartenders will frequently offer a Bloody Mary in its place. In Europe, the drink can be found wherever there are higher concentrations of Canadians. The drink's anonymity outside Canada has continued in spite of concerted marketing efforts. Producers of clam-tomato juices have speculated that their beverages have been hampered by what they describe as the \\"clam barrier\\". They have found that consumers in the United States fear that there is too much clam in the beverages.. While Motts Clamato continues to be synonymous with the cocktail, other producers have begun offering alternative caesar mixes. Walter Caesar (named in honor of Chell) was launched in 2013 to offer an 'all natural' alternative to Clamato. Walter Caesar also became the first caesar mix in Canada to be approved by Ocean Wise by using ocean-friendly clam juice from the North Atlantic. The Caesar is popular as a hangover \\"cure\\", though its effectiveness has been questioned. A study by the University of Toronto released in 1985 showed that drinking a Caesar when taking aspirin could help protect a person's stomach from the damage aspirin causes, as compared with drinking plain tomato juice. Mott's holds an annual \\"Best Caesar in Town\\" competition as part of the Prince Edward Island International Shellfish Festival. Contests held across Canada to celebrate the cocktail's 40th anniversary in 2009 encouraged variants that featured the glass rimmed with Tim Hortons coffee grinds, Caesars with maple syrup, and Caesars with bacon-infused vodka. Preparation Basic preparation of a Caesar follows the \\"one, two, three, four\\" rule. The recipe calls for 1 shot of vodka, two dashes of hot sauce, three dashes of salt and pepper, four dashes of Worcestershire sauce and topped with 4‚Äì6 oz of caesar mix and served with ice. The ingredients are poured into a glass rimmed with celery salt or a mixture of salt and pepper and garnished with a celery stalk and lime. The Caesar is an unusual drink in that it can be mixed in bulk and stored for a period of time before drinking. Variants Though it was not one of Chell's original ingredients, Tabasco sauce is a frequent addition, as is horseradish. Vodka is occasionally replaced with gin, tequila or rum, though the Clamato may not be substituted. A variant that replaces vodka with beer is commonly called a \\"Red Eye\\",\\"Clam Eye\\", or \\"Saskatchewan Caesar\\" and one without alcohol is a \\"Virgin Caesar\\". The Toronto Institute of Bartending operates a \\"Caesar School\\" in various locations across Canada that teaches bartenders how to mix several variants of the drink.

The external source can be an engine, a spring, a raised weight, or a compressed gas.Although liquids are generally considered to be practically incompressible, gases may be compressed and this compressed gas is a convenient energy store. An accumulator enables a hydraulic system to cope with extremes of demand using a less powerful pump, to respond more quickly to a temporary demand, and to smooth out pulsations. It is a type of energy storage device. Compressed gas accumulators, also called hydro-pneumatic accumulators, are by far the most common type.  Types of accumulators   Towers  Grimsby Dock Tower The first accumulators for Armstrong's hydraulic dock machinery were simple raised water towers. Water was pumped to a tank at the top of these towers by steam pumps. When dock machinery required hydraulic power, the hydrostatic head of the water's height above ground provided the necessary pressure. These simple accumulators were extremely tall. For instance, Grimsby Dock Tower, built in 1852, is tall. Because of their size, they were costly, and so were constructed for less than a decade. Around the same time, John Fowler was working on the construction of the ferry quay at nearby New Holland but could not use similar hydraulic power as the poor ground conditions did not permit a tall accumulator tower to be built. By the time Grimsby was opened, it was already obsolete as Armstrong had developed the more complex, but much smaller, weighted accumulator for use at New Holland. In 1892 the original Grimsby tower's function was replaced, on Fowler's advice, by a smaller weighted accumulator on an adjacent dock, although the tower remains to this day as a well-known landmark. Another surviving tower is adjacent to East Float in Birkenhead, England. Raised weight Hydraulic engine house, Bristol Harbour A raised weight accumulator consists of a vertical cylinder containing fluid connected to the hydraulic line. The cylinder is closed by a piston on which a series of weights are placed that exert a downward force on the piston and thereby pressurizes the fluid in the cylinder. In contrast to compressed gas and spring accumulators, this type delivers a nearly constant pressure, regardless of the volume of fluid in the cylinder, until it is empty. (The pressure will decline somewhat as the cylinder is emptied due to the decline in weight of the remaining fluid.) A working example of this type of accumulator may be found at the hydraulic engine house, Bristol Harbour. The original 1887 accumulator is in place in its tower, an external accumulator was added in 1954 and this system was used until 2010 to power the Cumberland Basin (Bristol) lock gates. The water is pumped from the harbour into a header tank and then fed by gravity to the pumps. The working pressure is 750 psi (5.2 MPa, or 52 bar) which was used to power the cranes, bridges and locks of Bristol Harbour. The original operating mechanism of Tower Bridge, London, also used this type of accumulator. Although no longer in use, two of the six accumulators may still be seen in situ in the bridge's museum. Regent's Canal Dock, now named Limehouse Basin has the remains of a hydraulic accumulator, dating from 1869, a fragment of the oldest remaining such facility in the world, the second at the dock, which was installed later than that at Poplar Dock, originally listed incorrectly as a signalbox for the London and Blackwall Railway, when correctly identified, it was restored as a tourist attraction by the now defunct London Docklands Development Corporation. Now owned by the Canal & River Trust, it is open for large groups on application to the Dockmaster's Office at the basin and on both the afternoons of London Open House Weekend, held on the third weekend of September each year. London had an extensive public hydraulic power system from the mid-nineteenth century finally closing in the 1970s with 5 hydraulic power stations, operated by the London Hydraulic Power Company. Railway goods yards and docks often had their own separate system.  Air-filled accumulator  Steam fire engine, with vertical copper accumulator A simple form of accumulator is an enclosed volume, filled with air. A vertical section of pipe, often enlarged diameter, may be enough and fills itself with air, trapped as the pipework fills. Such accumulators typically do not have enough capacity to be useful for storing significant power since they cannot be pre-charged with high pressure gas, but they can act as a buffer to absorb fluctuations in pressure. They are used to smooth out the delivery from piston pumps. Another use is as a shock absorber to damp out water hammer, this application is an integral part of most ram pumps. Loss of air will result in loss of effectiveness, if air will be lost over time the design must include some way to renew it. Compressed gas (or gas-charged) closed accumulator A bladder-type hydraulic accumulator. Fluid fills the internal rubber bladder which expands, compressing the air inside the sealed shell. Piston accumulator Citro√´n XM engine bay, showing two of Citro√´n's distinctive green spherical accumulators, used for the hydropneumatic suspension system A compressed gas accumulator consists of a cylinder with two chambers that are separated by an elastic diaphragm, a totally enclosed bladder, or a floating piston. One chamber contains the fluid and is connected to the hydraulic line. The other chamber contains an inert gas (typically nitrogen), usually under pressure, that provides the compressive force on the hydraulic fluid. Inert gas is used because oxygen and oil can form an explosive mixture when combined under high pressure. As the volume of the compressed gas changes, the pressure of the gas (and the pressure on the fluid) changes inversely. For low pressure water system use the water usually fills a rubber bladder within the tank (pictured), preventing contact with the tank which would otherwise need to be corrosion resistant. Units designed for high-pressure applications such as hydraulic systems are usually pre-charged to a very high pressure (approaching the system operating pressure) and are designed to prevent the bladder or membrane being damaged by this internal pressure when the system pressure is low. For bladder types this generally requires the bladder to be filled with the gas so that when system pressure is zero the bladder is fully expanded rather than being crushed by the gas charge. To prevent the bladder being forced out of the device when the system pressure is low there is typically either an anti-extrusion plate attached to the bladder that presses against and seals the entrance, or a spring-loaded plate on the entrance that closes when the bladder presses against it. It is possible to increase the gas volume of the accumulator by coupling a gas bottle to the gas side of the accumulator. For the same swing in system pressure this will result in a larger portion of the accumulator volume being used. If the pressure does not vary over a very wide range this can be a cost effective way to reduce the size of the accumulator needed. If the accumulator is not of the piston type care must be taken that the bladder or membrane will not be damaged in any expected over-pressure situation, many bladder-type accumulators cannot tolerate the bladder being crushed under pressure. A compressed gas accumulator was invented by Jean Mercier for use in variable- pitch propellers. Spring type A spring type accumulator is similar in operation to the gas-charged accumulator above, except that a heavy spring (or springs) is used to provide the compressive force. According to Hooke's law the magnitude of the force exerted by a spring is linearly proportional to its change of length. Therefore, as the spring compresses, the force it exerts on the fluid is increased linearly. Metal bellows type The metal bellows accumulators function similarly to the compressed gas type, except the elastic diaphragm or floating piston is replaced by a hermetically sealed welded metal bellows. Fluid may be internal or external to the bellows. The advantages to the metal bellows type include exceptionally low spring rate, allowing the gas charge to do all the work with little change in pressure from full to empty, a long stroke that allows efficient usage of the casing volume, and the bellows can be built to be resistant to significant over-pressure that would crush a bladder-type separator. The welded metal bellows accumulator provides an exceptionally high level of accumulator performance, and can be produced with a broad spectrum of alloys resulting in a broad range of fluid compatibility. Other advantages to this type are that it does not face issues with high pressure operation, may be built to be resistant to very high or low temperatures or certain aggressive chemicals, and may be significantly longer lasting in some situations. Metal bellows tend to be significantly more costly than other common types to produce.  Functioning of an accumulator  In modern, often mobile, hydraulic systems the preferred item is a gas charged accumulator, but simple systems may be spring-loaded. There may be more than one accumulator in a system. The exact type and placement of each may be a compromise due to its effects and the costs of manufacture. An accumulator is placed close to the pump with a non-return valve preventing flow back to the pump. In the case of piston-type pumps this accumulator is placed in the ideal location to absorb pulsations of energy from the multi-piston pump. It also helps protect the system from fluid hammer. This protects system components, particularly pipework, from both potentially destructive forces. An additional benefit is the additional energy that can be stored while the pump is subject to low demand. The designer can use a smaller-capacity pump. The large excursions of system components, such as landing gear on a large aircraft, that require a considerable volume of fluid can also benefit from one or more accumulators. These are often placed close to the demand to help overcome restrictions and drag from long pipework runs. The outflow of energy from a discharging accumulator is much greater, for a short time, than even large pumps could generate. An accumulator can maintain the pressure in a system for periods when there are slight leaks without the pump being cycled on and off constantly. When temperature changes cause pressure excursions the accumulator helps absorb them. Its size helps absorb fluid that might otherwise be locked in a small fixed system with no room for expansion due to valve arrangement. The gas precharge in an accumulator is set so that the separating bladder, diaphragm or piston does not reach or strike either end of the operating cylinder. The design precharge normally ensures that the moving parts do not foul the ends or block fluid passages. Poor maintenance of precharge can destroy an operating accumulator. A properly designed and maintained accumulator should operate trouble-free for years.

Incline bench press The bench press is an upper-body weight training exercise in which the trainee presses a weight upwards while lying on a weight training bench. The exercise uses the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoids, and the triceps, among other stabilizing muscles. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, but a pair of dumbbells can also be used. The barbell bench press is one of three lifts in the sport of powerlifting alongside the deadlift and squat, and is the only lift in the sport of Paralympic powerlifting. It is also used extensively in weight training, bodybuilding, and other types of training to develop the chest muscles.  Movement  The person performing the exercise lies on their back on a bench with a barbell grasped in both hands. They lower the barbell to chest level, then press the barbell upwards, extending the arms until the elbows are locked out. This is one repetition (rep). Powerlifting: Take position on a flat bench with body weight resting on buttocks and upper traps having an arched back and feet driven into the floor. Movement requires the weight to be taken at full arms' length, lowered to upper torso, paused, and then lifted to starting position. History The bench press has evolved over the years, from floor, bridge, and belly toss variations to the methods used by bodybuilders and powerlifters today. It become popular from the late 1950s onwards. Despite the fact the parallel dip is safer (the dip does not require spotters, or safety bars), in the 1950s the bench press took over the dip in popularity, and became the standard fare for chest exercises. At first the strict floor press was the most popular method. In 1899, using a barbell with discs (plates), George Hackenschmidt, inventor of the barbell hack squat, rolled a barbell over his face (which was turned to the side) and performed a strict floor press with . This stood as a record for 18 years until Joe Nordquest broke it by in 1916. Around this time, new methods started gaining ground. Lifters started figuring out that strong glutes could help them get the bar from the ground to overhead. They would lie on the floor and position the bar over their abdomen, then perform an explosive glute bridge movement, catapulting the bar upwards and catching it at lockout. Lifting techniques, training and drugs have improved over the years and the bench press record lift has grown from to (equipped, record held by Will Barotti) in approximately 100 years. The bench press is used as a test of upper-body explosive strength during the NFL combine, where prospective NFL draft picks attempt to get as many reps of 225 lbs as possible. Muscles A female athlete performing a bench press at the IPA world championship 2007, in the \\"Bench Only\\" category A conventional bench press uses the pectoralis major, anterior deltoids, and coracobrachialis muscles to horizontally adduct the shoulder. It also uses predominantly triceps and anconeous to extend the elbows. Wider hand spacing places a greater emphasis on shoulder flexion and narrower hand spacing utilizes more elbow extension. Because of this, wider hand spacing is associated with training the pectorals and narrower hand spacing is associated with training the triceps. In addition to the major phasic (dynamic) muscles the bench press also uses tonic (stabilizing) muscles: scapular stabilizers (serratus anterior, middle and inferior trapezius), humeral head stabilizers (rotator cuff muscles), and core (transverse abdominis, obliques, multifidus, erector spinae, quadratus lumborum) Variations Variations of the bench press involve different groups of muscles, or involve the same muscles in different ways: *The flat bench press involves both portions of the pectoralis major muscle but focuses on the lower (sternal) head as well as the anterior deltoid muscle. The term 'bench press' on its own is assumed to refer to a flat bench press. *An incline elevates the shoulders and lowers the pelvis as if reclining in a chair; this variation emphasizes anterior deltoids with little emphasis at the upper (clavicular) head of the pectoralis major. This variation is called the incline bench press. *A decline bench press elevates the pelvis and lowers the head, and emphasizes the lower portion of the pectoralis major whilst incorporating shoulders and triceps. A woman explains how to properly perform the dumbbell bench press and the dumbbell incline bench press. *A reverse grip bench press utilizes an underhand (supinated) grip on the bar. A supinated grip externally rotates the humerus, which puts the shoulders in a much more favorable position for the lift, decreasing injury potential without compromising range of motion. It emphasises the clavicular head of the pectoralis major more than an incline bench press. On the eccentric phase of the lift, the bar path will create a larger arc and eventually touch a point on the chest that is lower compared to the regular bench press, because the upper arms and elbows are closer to the body and the angle between the humerus and the torso is smaller. *A bench press performed with the hands close together (\\"close grip\\") relies on the triceps to complete the pressing motion. Called the close grip bench press, this variation is best performed with arms in a near-vertical position to reduce strain placed upon the wrists, elbows and shoulders. A close grip bench press can also be performed with dumbbells or a barbell with neutral grips. *A bench press performed with the hands far apart (\\"wide grip\\") shortens the range of motion, lessening the contribution of the triceps. * A lifter can elect to lower the bar to nipple level, to the xiphoid process, or even further, to the abdomen. On the other hand, a lifter may lower the bar to a very high point on the chest, or even to the neck; the latter variation is called a guillotine press and emphasizes the upper pectorals. * The bench press can be performed with various modifications to make the lifter or the weight less stable. Examples include lifting on a Swiss ball, using dumbbells instead of a barbell, or lifting with the legs on the bench or in the air * The bench press can be performed with chains and bands, which are used to strengthen the top end of the range of motion in the movement (the \\"lockout\\") and develop explosive power in the bench press. * An \\"equipped\\" bench press is performed with a stiff, supportive shirt that allows greater weights to be used. The materials and cut of the bench shirt, as well as the skill of the lifter and the rules of performance, will determine how much additional weight can be pressed in the shirt as opposed to without it. The contrast between equipped, and unequipped (raw) bench press weights is illustrated in the progression of the bench press world records, with the record equipped lift exceeding the unequipped lift by hundreds of pounds. * People who suffer from shoulder injuries can use a specialised barbell such as the Swiss Bar or Football Bar that allows them to hold the bar in a neutral grip, reducing the amount of external rotation on the shoulder. It also engages the shoulder more, increasing power in upper body movements. Another variation is the Hex Press in which two dumbbells are squeezed against each other, with the palms facing inwards. This puts the strain of the exercise on the triceps and inner chest rather than the shoulders. The Floor Press is another variation that puts less strain on the lifter's shoulders, due to the shorter range of motion. Possible injuries spotter using a thumbless grip. Performing the bench press can contribute to multiple types of injuries: *Torn ligaments / tendons in shoulders *Injuries to the trapezius muscle *Elbow / wrist strains *Cracked or broken ribs, usually the result of bouncing the bar off of the chest to add momentum to the lift or a loss of strength causing the bar to fall onto the chest *Distal clavicular osteolysis: bone spur or erosion at the end of the clavicle.

A subdiscipline of anatomy, anthropology, and paleontology, osteology is a detailed study of the structure of bones, skeletal elements, teeth, microbone morphology, function, disease, pathology, the process of ossification (from cartilaginous molds), and the resistance and hardness of bones (biophysics). A person who examines bones and determines cause of death is a forensic anthropologist. Forensic anthropologists are often used by scientists to help identify age, death, sex, growth, and development of human remains and can be used in a biocultural context. Sexual dimorphism is the difference of size in male and female skeletons. The two bone structures that are used to determine whether a person is male or female are the skull and pelvis. The bones can also be used to reveal the age of the person before they died. At birth the human cranial vault consists of seven separate bones; by age 5 these bones have knitted together at the cranial sutures. At about the age of 30 , the sutures generally begin to fill in with bone and smooth out. Another way to tell the age of bones is by bone osteons under a microscope or look for arthritis indicators on the bones. Younger adults have fewer and larger osteons while older adults have smaller and more osteon fragments, but arthritis will cause noticeable rounder bones. Osteology can determine an individual's race. It is typically grouped into three historical groups: Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid. But this classification systejm is becoming hard to use with each new generation of people. With this bone is the frame of life and the frame of the \\"big four of forensic anthropology\\" (sex, age, race, and stature) can be determined. Osteologists frequently work in the public and private sector as consultants for museums, scientists for research laboratories, scientists for medical investigations and/or for companies producing osteological reproductions in an academic context. Osteology and osteologists should not be confused with the holistic practice of medicine known as osteopathy and its practitioners, osteopaths.  Methods  A typical analysis will include: * an inventory of the skeletal elements present * a dental inventory * aging data, based upon epiphyseal fusion and dental eruption (for subadults) and deterioration of the pubic symphysis or sternal end of ribs (for adults) * stature and other metric data * ancestry * non- metric traits * pathology and/or cultural modifications  Applications  Comparative Osteology Room in the La Plata Museum, Argentina. Comparison of Great Dane and Chihuahua skeletons at the Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Osteological approaches are frequently applied to investigations in disciplines such as vertebrate paleontology, zoology, forensic science, physical anthropology and archaeology, and has a place in research on topics including: * Ancient warfare * Activity patterns * Criminal investigations * Demography * Developmental biology * Diet * Disease * Genetics of early populations * Fossil assemblages * Health * Human migration * Identification of unknown remains * Physique * Social inequality * War crimes  Crossrail Project  A recent endeavor by the city of London to expand their railway system inadvertently uncovered 25 human skeletons at Charterhouse Square in 2013. Although archaeological excavation of the skeletons temporarily halted the further advances in the railway system, they have given way to new, possibly revolutionary discoveries in the field, as well as re-write history. These 25 skeletal remains, along with many more that were found in further searches, are believed to be from the mass graves dug to bury the millions of victims of the Black Death in the 14th century. Archaeologists and forensic scientists have used osteology to examine the condition of the skeletal remains, to help piece together the reason why the Black Death had such a detrimental effect on the European population. It was discovered that most of the population was in generally poor health, to begin with. Through extensive analysis of the bones, it was discovered that many of the inhabitants of Great Britain were plagued with rickets, anemia, and malnutrition. There has also been frequent evidence that much of the population had traces of broken bones from frequent fighting and hard labor. This archaeological project has been named the Crossrail Project. Archaeologists will continue to excavate and search for remains to help uncover missing pieces of history. These advances in our understanding of the past will be improved by the study of other skeletons buried in the same area.

In the mid 1980s, members calling themselves the \\"scientific faction\\", and warning of the evils of electromagnetic waves (which the group claimed were causing catastrophic environmental destruction and climate change) built the Pana-Wave Laboratory in Fukui Prefecture in an area they believed was less at risk from electromagnetic pollution. Members started to dress only in white in the mid 1990s, in the belief that this would protect them from harmful \\"scalar electromagnetic waves\\", which they claimed were being used against them by communists to try to kill their leader. In 1994 the group formed a convoy of white vans which traveled around rural Japan searching for a place least at risk from harmful electromagnetic radiation and away from power lines, and setting up camp in remote locations for months on end and covering everything in white. They also took their leader Chino when she was ill with cancer into the mountains of Japan to search for a safe place where waves couldn't harm her anymore. They believed that if the waves got to their leader that all of mankind would all at once be destroyed.  Incidents in 2003  They first attracted attention in March 2003, when they attempted (and failed) to capture Tama-chan, an Arctic seal which had become a national celebrity in Japan since showing up in Tama River in Tokyo the previous year. The group believed that the seal had been led astray by electromagnetic waves, and claimed that doomsday would somehow be averted if the seal was returned to Arctic waters. They had even built two swimming pools, lined in white, in a compound in Yamanashi Prefecture in which to hold the seal until it could be transferred to the Arctic. The group made national headlines in April when the convoy was ordered by police to move on from a road in Gifu Prefecture and refused, resulting in a stand-off which was reported in the national media. Pana-Wave alleged that a close encounter with an undiscovered 10th planet, predicted for 15 May that year, would cause the Earth's poles to flip over and lead to catastrophic earthquakes and tsunamis which would destroy most of humankind, and that they were looking for a safe location to ride out the catastrophe. TV images showed members dressed completely in white, complete with white hoods, surgical masks and white boots. Their vehicles were decorated with swirl patterns which they believed neutralised the invisible waves, and even the steering wheel was covered in white plaster. Nearby trees, bushes and crash barriers were also covered in white fabric. TV crews were first shunned by members who feared that TV cameras were emitting harmful waves, but were later allowed closer as long as they covered themselves and their equipment in white material. This camp was eventually broken up by three hundred police, some in riot gear, who threatened to arrest them for obstructing traffic. The convoy moved on, setting up camp intermittently, but many in Japan were unnerved by the group, which evoked memories of Aum Shinrikyo, a religious terrorist group which carried out the deadly sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995, and the convoy continued being turned away from village after village. In the lead-up to the supposed doomsday, some one hundred riot police and TV crew followed the highly photogenic convoy around rural Japan for several weeks to keep tabs on their activities. On 14 May, the day before the predicted doomsday, police raided twelve locations associated with the group on the pretext of minor vehicle registration offences. However, nothing was found which suggested that they posed a danger to society. When the May 15 doomsday passed with nothing more serious than a minor earthquake in Tokyo which injured one boy who fell off his bed and broke an arm, a member thought to be Chino's second-in-command made a statement that they believed that they had miscalculated the date, and a new date of May 22 was set. However, as this date again passed without incident, media attention faded and the group sank back into obscurity. On 25 October 2006, Chino died aged 72.

The circle is formed by making a circle with the index finger, holding the thumb at the bottom of the ball parallel to the middle finger and holding the ball far out in the hand. The ball is thrown turning the palm out (pronating the forearm). Throwing mechanics A circle change can also be used to provide movement like a two seam fastball but without the stress placed on the arm by a traditional screwball. By placing the index and ring fingers slightly to the inside (that is, towards the thumb) of the ball and sharply pronating the forearm at release, a pitcher can make the ball move downward and inside. Pitchers with smaller hands will only place the index finger slightly to the inside (that is, towards the thumb) of the ball. A left-handed pitcher's circle change will break down and away from a right- handed batter. Effective circle changeups can reduce the platoon split a pitcher will experience. To follow proper form, a pitcher releases the ball while keeping his wrist straight, then follows through fully. Additional change in velocity can be achieved by dragging the foot that would normally follow through fully with a fastball delivery. However, the most effective way to reduce the velocity of a changeup is by slightly reducing stride length. If the typical stride length for the pitcher's fastball is around 80-90% of pitcher's height, then the pitcher would need to reduce stride by 10-20%. By doing so, the pitcher eliminates the possibility of tipping off the pitch. Simply using a slower arm motion is undesirable, as it may tip off the batter, and will invariably result in less movement on the pitch. If this pitch is placed too high in the strike zone, it can be hit very hard. It is an effective pitch to throw early in the count to produce a groundball; it is not traditionally used to acquire a strikeout. By rotating the wrist (before the release) the pitcher can change the movement from resembling a fastball to resembling a curveball. Like other changeups, an effective circle changeup must be thrown with an identical arm action to a fastball to avoid tipping off the batter. Professional practitioners Johan Santana, Pedro Mart√≠nez, Cole Hamels, Huston Street, Zack Greinke, Kyle Hendricks and Marco Estrada are pitchers who rely heavily on their circle changeup. Former New York Mets closer John Franco was able to generate so much movement on his circle changeup that it mimicked a screwball. Atlanta Braves pitcher Tom Glavine was known for using the outside corner of the plate with his circle changeup. Minnesota Twins ace Frank Viola also used the circle changeup to great effect, as well as former Atlanta Braves pitcher Charlie Leibrandt. Recently, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hyun-jin Ryu used a circle changeup efficiently throughout his first MLB season, throwing a circle changeup that was gripped using the index finger on the seam of the ball and the thumb on the side of the ball to \\"choke\\" the ball. According to his autobiography, Nolan Ryan also developed his own circle changeup to add another off-speed pitch without having to throw a slider (as sliders are believed to more frequently cause injuries).

The name derives from the building's structure of post and lintel construction, a type of timber framing where the load-bearing ore-pine posts are called stafr in Old Norse (stav in modern Norwegian). Two related church building types also named for their structural elements, the post church and palisade church, are often called 'stave churches'. Originally much more widespread, most of the surviving stave churches are in Norway. The only remaining medieval stave churches outside Norway are those of circa 1500 at Hedared in Sweden and one Norwegian stave church relocated in 1842 to contemporary Karpacz in the Karkonosze mountains of Poland (at the time being a part of the Kingdom of Prussia). One other church, the Anglo-Saxon Greensted Church in England, exhibits many similarities with a stave church but is generally considered a palisade church.  Construction  Gol Stave Church, belonging to the Borgund group. The drawing is slightly erroneous, as the sill under the church floor is missing. Archaeological excavations have shown that stave churches, best represented today by the Borgund Stave Church, are descended from palisade constructions and from later churches with earth-bound posts. Similar palisade constructions are known from buildings from the Viking Age. Logs were split in two-halves, set or rammed into the earth (generally called post in ground construction) and given a roof. This proved a simple but very strong form of construction. If set in gravel, the wall could last many decades, even centuries. An archaeological excavation in Lund uncovered the postholes of several such churches. In post churches, the walls were supported by sills, leaving only the posts earth-bound. Such churches are easy to spot at archaeological sites as they leave very distinct holes where the posts were once placed. Occasionally some of the wood remains, making it possible to date the church more accurately using radiocarbon dating and/or with dendrochronology. Under the Urnes Stave Church, remains have been found of two such churches, with Christian graves discovered beneath the oldest church structure. A single church of palisade construction has been discovered under the Hemse stave church. Borgund Stave Church Floorplan of the church, depicting the lower frame The next design phase resulted from the observation that earthbound posts were susceptible to humidity, causing them to rot away over time. To prevent this, the posts were placed on top of large stones, significantly increasing their lifespans. The stave church in R√∏ldal is believed to be of this type. In still later churches, the posts were set on a raised sill frame resting on stone foundations. This is the stave church in its most mature form. It is now common to group the churches into two categories: the first, without free-standing posts, often referred to as Type A; and the second, with a raised roof and free-standing internal posts, usually called Type B. Those with the raised roof, Type B, are often further divided into two subgroups. The first of these, the Kaupanger group, have a whole arcade row of posts and intermediate posts along the sides and details that mimic stone capitals. These churches give an impression of a basilica. The other subgroup is the Borgund group. In these churches the posts are connected halfway up with one or two horizontal double ‚Ä≥pincer beams‚Ä≥ with semicircular indentations, clasping the row of posts from both sides. Cross- braces are inserted between the posts and the upper and lower pincer beams (or above the single pincer beam), forming a very rigid interconnection, and resembling the triforium of stone basilicas. This design made it possible to omit the freestanding lower part of intermediate posts. In some churches in Valdres, only the four corner posts remain (see the image of Lomen Stave Church). Many stave churches had or still have outer galleries or ambulatories around their whole perimeters, loosely connected to the plank walls. These probably served to protect the church from a harsh climate, and for processions.  Single nave church, Type A  Reinli Stave Church with the old pillory, S√∏r-Aurdal At the base of Type A churches, there are four heavy sill beams on a low foundation of stones. These are interconnected in the corner notch, forming a rigid sill frame. The corner posts or staves (stavene in Norwegian) are cross-cut at the lower end and fit over the corner notches and cover them, protecting them from moisture. On top of the sill beam is a groove into which the lower ends of the wall planks (veggtilene) fit. The last wall plank is wedge-shaped and rammed into place. When the wall is filled in with planks, the frame is completed by a wall plate (stavl√¶gje) with a groove on the bottom, holding the top ends of the wall planks. The whole structure consists of framesa sill frame resting on the stone foundation, and the four wall frames made up of sills, corner posts and wall plate. The wall plates support the roof trusses, consisting of a pair of principal rafters and an additional pair of intersecting \\"scissor rafters\\". For lateral bracing, additional wooden brackets (buekn√¶r) are inserted between the rafters. Every piece is locked into position by other pieces, making for a very rigid construction; yet all points otherwise susceptible to the harsh weather are covered. * The single nave church has a square nave and a narrower square choir. This type of stave church was common at the beginning of the 12th century. * The long church, (Langkyrkje), has a rectangular plan with nave and choir of the same width. The nave will usually take up two-thirds of the whole length. This type was common at the end of the 13th century. * The center post church, (Midtmastkyrkje) has a single central post reaching all the way up to and connected to the roof construction. But the roof is a simple hipped one, without the raised central part of the Type B churches. This variation on the common type of church, found in Numedal and Hallingdal, dates to around 1200. Single nave churches in Norway: Grip, Haltdalen, Undredal, Hedal, Reinli, Eidsborg, Rollag, Uvdal, Nore, H√∏yjord, R√∏ldal and Garmo. The only remaining similar church in Sweden, in Hedared, is of this type and shows similarities with the one from Haltdalen.  Church with a raised roof, Type B  Interior from Lomen Stave Church depicting cross braces between upper and lower pincer beams and posts. Intermediate posts have been omitted. On the stone foundation, four huge ground beams (grunnstokker) are placed like a sign, their ends protruding 1‚Äì2 meters from the lap joint where they intersect. The ends of these beams support the sills of the outer walls, forming a separate horizontal frame. The tall internal posts are placed on the internal frame of ground beams, and carry the main roof above the central nave (skip). On the outer frame of sills rest the main wall planks (veggtiler), carrying the roof over the pentice or aisles (omgang) surrounding the central space. The roof thus slopes down in two steps, as in a basilica. The tall internal posts (staver) are interconnected with brackets (buekn√¶r), and also connected to the outer walls with aisle rafters, creating a laterally rigid construction. Closer to the top of the posts (staver), shorter sills inserted between them support the upper wall (tilevegg). On top of the posts wall plates (stavl√¶gjer) support the roof trusses, similar to those of the single nave churches. The Kaupanger group consists of: Kaupanger, Urnes, Hopperstad and Lom. The Borgund group consists of: Borgund, Gol, Hegge, H√∏re (Hurum), Lomen, Ringebu and √òye. This form of a church can also be recognized from the holes which remain from earlier earth-bound post churches built on the same sites. Little is known about what these older churches actually looked like or how they were constructed, as they were all destroyed or replaced many centuries ago.  History  Jelling church stone in Denmark Portal in column from Borgund Stave Church Portal inside wall from Hedal Stave Church Arch decoration from Urnes Stave Church Lion on arch decoration from Borgund Stave Church Stave churches were once common in northern Europe. In Norway alone, it was thought about 1000 were built; recent research has upped this number and it is now believed there may have been closer to 2000.  Norway  Most of the surviving stave churches in Norway were built 1150‚Äì1350.Storsletten, Ola (1993). En arv i tre: de norske stavkirkene. Oslo: Aschehoug. . Stave churches older than the 1100s are known only from written sources or from archaeological excavations, but written sources are sparse and difficult to interpret.Anker, Leif: Middelalder i tre, Stavkirker, ARFO forlag 2005, (Kirker i Norge; bind 4) Only 271 masonry churches were constructed in Norway during the same period, 160 of these still exist, while in Sweden and Denmark there were 900 and 1800 masonry churches respectively.Ekroll, √òystein (1997): Med kleber og kalk. Norsk steinbygging i mellomalderen. Oslo: Samlaget. Frostathing Law and Gulating law rules about \\"corner posts\\" shows that stave church was the standard church building in Norway, even if the catholic church preferred stone. All wooden churches in Norway before the reformation were constructed with staves. Log building is younger than stave building in Norway and was introduced in residential buildings around year 1000. Stave building is not influenced by the log technique.Bugge and Mezzanotte, 1994, p. 17. The word \\"stave church\\" is unknown in Old Norse, presumably because there were no other types of wooden churches. When Norway's churches after the Reformation were constructed in log, there was a need for a separate word for the older churches. In written sources from the Middle Ages, there is a clear distinction between \\"stafr\\" (posts) and \\"√æili\\" or \\"v√¶g√æili\\" (wall boards). However, in documents from the 1600‚Äì1700s, \\"stave\\" was also used for wall boards or panels. Emil Eckhoff in his Svenska stavkyrkor (1914‚Äì1916) also included wood frame church buildings without posts.Gj√¶rder, Per (1999). Stolper og staver i bygningsteknisk sammenheng. Grindbygde hus i Vest-Norge. NIKU-seminar om grindbygde hus, Bryggens museum 23.-25.03 1998. Edited by Helge Schjelderup and Ola Storsletten. Oslo: Norsk institutt for kulturminneforskning. According to Norway's oldest written laws and Old Norwegian Homily Book, the consecration of the church was valid as long as the four corner posts were standing. One of the sermons in the old homily book is known as the \\"stave church sermon\\". The sermon dates from around 1100 and was presumably performed at consecrations, or on the anniversary of such. The sermon text is a theological interpretation of the building elements in the church. It names most of the building elements in the stave church, and can be a source of terminology and technique.Storsletten, Ola (1993). Takverk i steinkirker fra middelalderen. Oslo: Program for forskning om kulturminnevern, Norges forskningsr√•d. .√Åg√∫stsson, H√∂rdur 1976: \\"Kyrkjehus i ei norr√∏n homilie\\". By og Bygd, vol. XXV, 1‚Äì38; according to J√∏rgen H. Jensenius \\"Stavkirkeprekenen som bygningshistorisk kilde\\" I: Fortidsminneforeningens √•rbok, 2001. For instance, the sermon says: \\"The four corner posts of the church are a symbol for the four gospels, because their teachings are the strongest supports within the whole of Christianity.\\"Gammelnorsk homiliebok. Oslo: Universitetsforlaget, 1971, p. 102. Church building was mentioned in the Gulatingsloven (Gulating Law), which was written down in the 1000s. In the chapter on Christianity, the 12th article states:Gulatingslovi. Oslo: Samlaget. 1952 In Norway, stave churches were gradually replaced; many survived until the 19th century when a substantial number were destroyed. Today, 28 historical stave churches remain standing in Norway. Stave churches were particularly common in less populated areas in high valleys and forest land, and fishermen's villages on islands and in minor villages along fjords. Around 1800 in Norway 322 stave churches were still known and most of these were in sparsely populated areas of Norway. If the main church was masonry the annex church could be a stave church. Masonry churches were mostly built in towns, along the coast, and in rich agricultural areas in Tr√∏ndelag and East Norway, as well as in the larger parishes in fjord districts in Western Norway. During 1400s and 1500s no new churches were built in Norway.Vreim, Halvor (1947): Norsk trearkitektur. Oslo: Gyldendal. Norway's stave churches largely disappeared until 1700 and were replaced by log buildings. Several stave churches were redesigned or enlarged in a different technique during 1600‚Äì1700, for instance Flesberg Stave Church was converted into a cruciform church partly in log construction.Muri, Sigurd: Gamle kyrkjer i ny tid. Oslo: Samlaget, 1975, s. 14. According to Dietrichson, most stave churches were dismantled to make room for a new church, partly because the old church had become too small for the congregation, partly because the stave church was in poor condition. Fire, storm, avalanche and decay were other reasons. In 1650 there were about 270 stave churches left in Norway, and in the next hundred years 136 of these disappeared. Around 1800 there were still 95 stave churches, while over 200 former stave churches were still known by name or in written sources. From 1850 to 1885 32 stave churches fell, since then only the Fantoft Stave Church has been lost. Heddal stave church was the first stave church described in a scholarly publication when Johannes Flintoe wrote an essay in Samlinger til det Norske Folks Sprog og Historie (Christiania, 1834). The book also printed Flintoes drawings of the facade, the ground floor and the floor plan ‚Äì the first known architectural drawing of a stave church.  Other countries  It is unknown how many stave churches were constructed in Iceland and in other countries in Europe. Some believe they were the first type of church to be constructed in Scandinavia; however, the post churches are an older type, although the difference between the two is slight. A stave church has a lower construction set on a frame, whereas a post church has earth-bound posts. In Sweden, the stave churches were considered obsolete in the Middle Ages and were replaced. In Denmark, traces of post churches have been found at several locations, and there are also parts still in existence from some of them. A plank of one such church was found in Jutland. The plank is now on display at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen and an attempt at reconstructing the church is a featured display at the Moesg√•rd Museum near Aarhus. Marks created by several old post churches have also been found at the old stone church in Jelling. In Sweden, the medieval Hedared stave church was constructed c. 1500 at the same location as a previous stave church. Other notable places are Maria Minor church in Lund, with its traces of a post church with palisades, and some old parts of Hemse stave church on Gotland. In Sk√•ne alone there were around 300 such churches when Adam of Bremen visited Denmark in the first half of the 11th century, but how many of those were stave churches or post churches is unknown. In England, there is one similar church of Saxon origin, with much debate as to whether it is a stave church or predates them. This is the Greensted Church in Essex. General consensus categorizes it as Saxon [Type A]. There is also another church which bears similarities to stave churches, the medieval stone church of St. Mary in Kilpeck in Herefordshire. It features a number of dragon heads. In Germany, there is one stone church with a motif depicting a dragon similar to those often seen on Norwegian stave churches and on surviving artifacts from Denmark and Gotland. Whether this decoration can be attributed to cultural similarities or whether it indicates similar construction methods in Germany has sparked controversy. During 1950‚Äì1970 post holes from older buildings were discovered under Lom stave church as well as under masonry churches such as Kinsarvik Church, and this discovery was an important contribution to understanding the origin of stave churches. Holes for posts were first identified during excavations in Urnes stave church.Christie, H√•kon: Urnes stavkirkes forl√∏per belyst ved utgravninger under kirken, Foreningen til norske Fortidsminnesmerkers bevaring, √Örbok 1958, vol. 113, pp. 49‚Äì74  Influences  Lorentz Dietrichson in his book De norske Stavkirker (\\"The Norwegian Stave Churches\\") (1892) claimed that the stave church is \\"a brilliant translation of the Romanesque basilica from stone to wood\\" (\\"En genial oversettelse fra sten til tre av den romanske basilika\\"). Dietrichson claimed that type B displays an influence from early Christian and Roman basilicas. The style was assumed to be transferred via Anglo-Saxon and Irish architecture, where only the particular roof construction was local. Dietrichson emphasized the clerestory, arcades and capitals.Dietrichson, L. (1892). De norske stavkirker: studier over deres system, oprindelse og historiske udvikling : et bidrag til Norges middelalderske bygningskunsts historie. Kristiania: Cammermeyer. The \\"basilica theory\\" was introduced by N. Nicolaysen in Mindesm√¶rker af Middelalderens Kunst i Norge (1854). Nicolaysen wrote: \\"Our stave churches are now the only remaining of its kind, and according to the sparse records and known circumstances, it appears that nothing similar existed except perhaps in Britain and Ireland.\\" (\\"Vore stavkirker er nu de eneste i sit slags, og saavidt sparsomme beretninger og andre omst√¶ndigheder lader formode, synes de heller ikke tidligere at have havt noget sidestykke med undtagelse af maaske i Storbritannien og Irland.\\")Dietrichson (1892) p. 82 Nicolaysen further claimed that the layout and design may have been inspired by Byzantine architecture. Nicolaysen wrote: \\"All facts suggest that the stave churches like the masonry churches and all medieval architecture in Western Europe originated from the Roman basilica.\\" (\\"Alt synes at henpege paa, at forbilledet til vore stavkirker ligesom til stenkirkerne og overhovedet til hele den vesteurop√¶iske arkitektur i middelalderen er udgaaet fra den romerske basilika.\\")Dietrichson (1892) p, 83 This theory was further developed by Anders Bugge and Roar Hauglid. Peter Anker believed that the influence from foreign masonry architecture was primarily in decorative details.Peter Anker (1997) Stavkirkene: deres egenart og historie. Oslo: Cappelen. . Per Jonas Nordhagen does not reject the basilica theory, but suggests development along two paths and that the basilical was a development towards larger and technically more sophisticated churches. The main, progressive path according to Nordhagen lead to Torpo and Borgund.Nordhagen, Per Jonas, \\"Stavkyrkjene\\" in Norsk arkitekturhistorie: fr√• steinalder og bronsealder til det 21. hundre√•ret. Oslo: Samlaget 2003, , pp. 89‚Äì119 Folklore and circumstantial evidence seem to suggest that stave churches were built upon old indigenous Norse worship sites, the hof. Dietrichson believed that the stave churches were closely connected to the hof and the \\"hof theory\\" attracted interest in the 1930‚Äì1940s. The theory assumed that the hofs were buildings with a square and a raised roof supported by four columns. During Christianization of Norway local chiefs were forced to either dismantle the hofs or to convert hofs into churches. Bugge and Norberg-Schultz accordingly claimed that \\"there is no reason to believe that the last hofs and the first churches had any major differences\\" (\\"og da er det liten grunn til √• tro at de siste hov har skilt seg synderlig fra de f√∏rste kirker\\").Bugge og Norgberg-Schultz, 1994, s. 35. This assumption has been rejected by archeological evidence several times, in the case of Iceland by √Öge Roussel.Aage Roussel, Islands gudehove, Stenberger 1943, side 215-223 Olaf Olsen described the hof merely as function related to ordinary buildings on major farms. If the hof was a particular building they remain to be identified, according to Olsen.Olaf Olsen, H√∏rg, hov og kirke Olsen rejected the hof theory. Nicolay Nicolaysen also concluded that there is not a single case known of a hof that was converted to a church.Jensenius, J√∏rgen H. (2001): Trekirkene f√∏r stavkirkene. Avhandling dr.ing. [PhD-dissertation], Arkitekth√∏yskolen i Oslo, 2001. Lack of historical evidence for hofs as buildings undermines the hof theory.Nordhagen 2003 Nicolaysen also introduced the community centre hypothesis which argued that hofs were destroyed and churches constructed on the same convenient location for the local community. Location near a previous hof would then be a coincidence, according to Nicolaysen. Pope Gregory I encouraged (year 601) Augustine of Canterbury to reuse pre-Christian temples, but this had little relevance for Norway according to Nicolaysen. Jan Brendalsmo in his dissertation concluded that churches were often established on major farms or farms of local chiefs and close to feasting halls or graveyards.Hansen, Margareth (2014). Fire kirkesteder i Romsdal. Bergen: Universitetet i Bergen. Stave churches appear to sometimes to have built upon or used materials from old pagan worship sites and are considered to be the best evidence for the existence of Norse Pagan temples and the best guide as to what they looked like.Davidson, H. R. Ellis. 1988. Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe : Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions. Syracuse: Syracuse University Press. The layout of the churches is believed to have mimicked old Pagan temples in design and was possibly designed in order to adhere to old Norse cosmological beliefs, especially as some churches were built around a central point like a world tree. Stave churches were also often located near or in the sight of large natural formations which also had a significant role in Norse Paganism, thus also suggesting a form of continuity through placement and symbolism.Reed, Michael F. \\"Norwegian Stave Churches and Their Pagan Antecedents.\\" RACAR: Revue D'art Canadienne / Canadian Art Review 24, no. 2 (1997): 3‚Äì13 Furthermore, dragons' heads and other clear mythological symbolism suggests the cultural blending of Norse mythological beliefs and Christianity in a non-contradictory synthesis. Owing to this evidence newer research has suggested that Christianity was introduced into Norway much earlier than was previously assumed.  Architecture and decoration  Portal detail from T√∏njum Stave Church Even though the wooden churches had structural differences, they give a recognizable general impression. Formal differences may hide common features of their planning, while apparently similar buildings may turn out to have their structural elements organized completely differently. Despite this, certain basic principles must have been common to all types of building. Basic geometrical figures, numbers that were easy to work with, one or just a few length units and simple ratios, and perhaps proportions as well were among the theoretical aids all builders inherited. The specialist was the man who knew a particular type of building so well that he could systematise its elements in a slightly different way from previous building designs, thus carrying developments a stage further. \\"Exposing the timber frame on the interior and/or exterior of the structures is seen to release its matrix of timber members and its capacity to contribute architectural expression to buildings. The matrix, forming ‚Äòlines‚Äô in space, has an expressive potential that includes the capacity to delineate proportion, direct eye-movement, suggest spatial enclosure, create patterning, permit transparency and establish continuity with landscape.\\"The Expressive Capacity of the Timber Frame by Brit Andresen.

Retrieved 2 November 2013  Dating of churches  Stave churches can be dated in various ways: by historical records or inscriptions, by stylistic means using construction details or ornaments, or by dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating. Often historical records or inscriptions will point to a year when the church is known to have existed. Archaeological excavations can yield finds which can provide relative dating for the structure, whereas absolute dating methods such as radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology can provide a more exact date. One drawback of dendrochronology is that it tends to overlook the possibility that the wood could have been reused from an older structure, or felled and left for many years before use. A very important problem in dating the churches is that the solid ground sills are the construction elements most likely to have the outer parts of the log still preserved. Yet they are the most susceptible to humidity, and as people back then reused building parts, the church may have been rebuilt several times. If so, a dendrochronological dating may be based upon a log from a later reconstruction.

After starting his career as a professor at the University of the Ry≈´ky≈´s, he wrote books in English and Japanese, mostly about the Battle of Okinawa and Japan‚ÄìUnited States bilateral relations following World War II. After his retirement as professor he was elected as governor and was best known for his strong stand against occupation of prefectural lands by military bases of United States, going against the Japanese central government at the time.  Early life and academic career  ≈åta was born on 12 June 1925 on Kumejima Island, Okinawa and his family migrated during World War II. He became a student at the Okinawa Teacher's College, and during the Battle of Okinawa he was drafted into the Japanese Army's \\"Iron and Blood Student Corps\\"; he saw intense combat and many of his classmates died. After the end of the battle, he spent some months in hiding before emerging to surrender.https://apjjf.org/-Ota-Masahide/3415/article.html He was educated at the Waseda University, Tokyo earning a Bachelor's degree in English and took a Master's degree in Journalism from Syracuse University, New York. From 1958, he was a professor at the University of the Ry≈´ky≈´s where he was chairman of Department of Social Science, and later dean of the College of Law and Letters. He published around 45 books in English and Japanese. His books were mostly based on Okinawa's role in Japan‚ÄìUnited States relations, post-war occupation by the military in prefectures and the Battle of Okinawa of 1945.  Political career  In March 1990, ≈åta retired from the university and in November of the same year was elected governor of Okinawa prefecture on a non-party platform defeating the 12-year sitting governor Junji Nishime. His campaign was based on removing U.S. bases from the island to bring back peace. He also opposed the then proposed bill to provide Japanese troops for United Nations' peacekeeping missions. He had a distinguished record as a governor, outspokenly arguing for the interests of the Okinawan people against both the United States military establishment in the Ryukyu Islands and the Japanese central government. After being elected as governor. ≈åta failed to make headway on his campaign promises. His requests to discuss the issue of U.S. military occupation in the prefecture with the U.S. authorities were dismissed, stating that all such discussions would happen with the Japanese central government. In 1991, he reluctantly signed lease agreements that enabled military bases use of private lands. This resulted in disapproval from anti-war masses that had earlier supported ≈åta in elections. In February 1995, reports from Washington prepared by Harvard professor Joseph Nye indicated their plans of deploying over 100,000 soldiers in Japan and South Korea. On 4 September 1995, a 12-year-old local girl was raped by three U.S. servicemen, and protests were held against the military's establishments in the area. ≈åta considered these two events as hindrance to peace in the prefecture. From 1996 to 1998, he actively worked to establish cordial relations with U.S. On 8 September 1996, he organized a plebiscite in his prefecture which brought results that about 60 percent of citizens who supported reduction of military bases. On 10 July 1996, he appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan to relocate various military bases to mainland. As governor, he rejected permissions of U.S. military asking to extend lease for use of private land. This led to conflict between local and central government. The central government amended laws which gave it the power to endorse such documents. Due to ≈åta's efforts, mass campaigns such as the Okinawa Women Act against Military Violence, which arranged a rally at Ginowan's Seaside Front on 21 October 1995, had nearly 85,000 people participating. The Japanese and American governments together set up the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) to deal with the problems. In 1996, the U.S. and Japanese government agreed to closure or relocation of various military bases, including the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, the most prominent based in the centre of Ginowan city's residential area. The move has however not happened as on June 2017 due to various issues. In 1995, he inaugurated the monument Cornerstone of Peace which commemorated more than 200,000 people who died in the Okinawa Battle, including U.S. soldiers. In 1998, Keiz≈ç Obuchi replaced Ryutaro Hashimoto as the Prime Minister of Japan. Obuchi supported the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) candidate Keiichi Inamine for the governor's post in opposition to ≈åta. By then the central and American government considered ≈åta as \\"one of the biggest thornes\\" on both sides in the Japan‚ÄìAmerica relationship. Inamine, the eldest son of oil company Ryukyu Sekiyo's owner Ichiro Inamine, led a successful campaign not disregarding ≈åta's work directly but calling it unrealistic. The central government cut down subsidies to Okinawa in 1998 leading to 9.2 percent of unemployment in August 1998. Inamine promised to revive the employment condition with his contacts in the central government and on the day of election LDP's campaign banners had slogan \\"9.2 percent\\" whereas ≈åta campaigned using \\"Okinawans, Don't Sell Your Souls.\\" ≈åta lost with 46.9 percent votes whereas 52.1 percent went to Inamine. In 2001, on the ticket of Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), ≈åta won a seat in the House of Councillors (Upper House). He took retirement from active politics in 2007. Later life and death In 2013, he founded the Okinawa International Peace Research Institute at Naha. In April 2017, ≈åta was reported to have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. ≈åta died on his 92nd birthday on 12 June 2017 at a hospital in Naha after suffering from pneumonia and respiratory failure. Upon his death, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga called him \\"an individual who energetically tackled Okinawa's base issues and (economic) development at a turbulent time.\\"  Books  * The Battle of Okinawa: The Typhoon of Steel and Bombs, Kume Publishing Company (1984) * Okinawa no tei≈ç, k≈çt≈ç benmukan, Asahi Shinbunsha (1996)  References  Category:1925 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Ryukyuan people Category:Politicians from Okinawa Prefecture Category:Waseda University alumni Category:Syracuse University alumni Category:Japanese academics Category:Japanese military personnel of World War II Category:Governors of Okinawa Prefecture Category:Deaths from respiratory failure Category:Japanese politicians of Ryukyuan descent ","title":"Masahide ≈åta"},{"id":"641653","text":"Duke of Dorset was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1720 for the politician Lionel Sackville, 7th Earl of Dorset. History The Sackville family descended from Sir Richard Sackville. His only surviving son, Thomas Sackville, was a statesman, poet and dramatist and notably served as Lord High Treasurer between 1599 and 1608. He was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Buckhurst, of Buckhurst in the County of Sussex, in 1567, and was made Earl of Dorset in 1604, also in the Peerage of England. The titles descended in the direct line until the death of his grandson, the third Earl, in 1624. The late Earl was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He was Lord Chamberlain between 1642 and 1649. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl. He married Lady Frances, daughter of Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Earl. He succeeded to the Cranfield estates on the death of his maternal uncle Lionel Cranfield, 3rd Earl of Middlesex. In 1675, two years before he succeeded his father, he was raised to the Peerage of England in his own right as Baron Cranfield, of Cranfield in the County of Dorset, and Earl of Middlesex. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned seventh Earl, who was made Duke of Dorset in 1720. The Duke of Dorset was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Duke. The latter was succeeded by his nephew, the third Duke. He was the son of Lord John Sackville, second son of the first Duke. He was the British Ambassador to France between 1783 and 1789 in the lead up to the French Revolution. He was succeeded by his only son, the fourth Duke. He died unmarried at an early age in 1815 after a fall from his horse. The titles passed to his cousin, Charles Sackville-Germain, 2nd Viscount Sackville, who became the fifth Duke. He was the son of George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville, third son of the first Duke (see Viscount Sackville). All titles became extinct on his death in 1843, though the baronies were later revived. The family seat was Knole House, Kent, and the Sackvilles previously owned Buckhurst Park and Croxall Hall. On the death of the fourth Duke in 1815, Knole House was inherited by the late Duke's sister, Lady Elizabeth Sackville. She was the wife of George West, 5th Earl De La Warr, who assumed the additional surname of Sackville. In 1865, the barony of Buckhurst held by the Earls and Dukes of Dorset was revived in Elizabeth's favour. In 1876 the Sackville title was also revived when her younger son Mortimer Sackville-West was created Baron Sackville.

In 1977, the book's protagonist is the granddaughter of George Frederick Henry, the 10th Duke of Dorset. He is mentioned as being born in 1886, having been severely wounded at the Battle of Ypres in World War I and later devoting himself to gardening. Other members of the Duke's family also have a big share in the plot, particularly his daughter Mary, an SOE agent in World War II captured and tortured to death by the Nazis.

CubeSats are commonly put in orbit by deployers on the International Space Station, or launched as secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. More than 1200 CubeSats have been launched as of January 2020. More than 1100 have been successfully deployed in orbit and more than 80 have been destroyed in launch failures. In 1999, California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) and Stanford University developed the CubeSat specifications to promote and develop the skills necessary for the design, manufacture, and testing of small satellites intended for low Earth orbit (LEO) that perform a number of scientific research functions and explore new space technologies. Academia accounted for the majority of CubeSat launches until 2013, when more than half of launches were for non-academic purposes, and by 2014 most newly deployed CubeSats were for commercial or amateur projects. Yearly launched and planned CubeSats as of January 2020 Total count of CubeSats launched as of 30 December 2018 Uses typically involve experiments that can be miniaturized or serve purposes such as Earth observation or amateur radio. CubeSats are employed to demonstrate spacecraft technologies intended for small satellites or that present questionable feasibility and are unlikely to justify the cost of a larger satellite. Scientific experiments with unproven underlying theory may also find themselves aboard CubeSats because their low cost can justify higher risks. Biological research payloads have been flown on several missions, with more planned. Several missions to the Moon and Mars are planning to use CubeSats. In May 2018, the two MarCO CubeSats became the first CubeSats to leave Earth orbit, on their way to Mars alongside the successful InSight mission. Some CubeSats have become the first national satellites of their countries, being launched by universities, state-owned, or private companies. The searchable Nanosatellite and CubeSat Database lists over 2,000 CubeSats that have been and are planned to be launched since 1998.  History 1U CubeSat structure Professors Jordi Puig-Suari of California Polytechnic State University and Bob Twiggs of Stanford University proposed the CubeSat reference design in 1999 with the aim of enabling graduate students to design, build, test and operate in space a spacecraft with capabilities similar to that of the first spacecraft, Sputnik. The CubeSat, as initially proposed, did not set out to become a standard; rather, it became a standard over time by a process of emergence. The first CubeSats launched in June 2003 on a Russian Eurockot, and approximately 75 CubeSats had entered orbit by 2012. The need for such a small-factor satellite became apparent in 1998 as a result of work done at Stanford University's Space System Development Laboratory. At SSDL, students had been working on the OPAL (Orbiting Picosatellite Automatic Launcher) microsatellite since 1995. OPAL's mission to deploy daughter-ship \\"picosatellites\\" had resulted in the development of a launcher system that was \\"hopelessly complicated\\" and could only be made to work \\"most of the time\\". With the project's delays mounting, Twiggs sought DARPA funding that resulted in the redesign of the launching mechanism into a simple pusher-plate concept with the satellites held in place by a spring-loaded door. Desiring to shorten the development cycle experienced on OPAL and inspired by the picosatellites OPAL carried, Twiggs set out to find \\"how much could you reduce the size and still have a practical satellite\\". The picosatellites on OPAL were , a size that was not conducive to covering all sides of the spacecraft with solar cells. Inspired by a cubic plastic box used to display Beanie Babies in stores, Twiggs first settled on the larger ten-centimeter cube as a guideline for the new (yet-to-be-named) CubeSat concept. A model of a launcher was developed for the new satellite using the same pusher-plate concept that had been used in the modified OPAL launcher. Twiggs presented the idea to Puig- Suari in the summer of 1999 and then at the Japan‚ÄìU.S. Science, Technology and Space Applications Program (JUSTSAP) conference in November 1999. The term \\"CubeSat\\" was coined to denote nanosatellites that adhere to the standards described in the CubeSat design specification. Cal Poly published the standard in an effort led by aerospace engineering professor Jordi Puig-Suari. Bob Twiggs, of the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University, and currently a member of the space science faculty at Morehead State University in Kentucky, has contributed to the CubeSat community. His efforts have focused on CubeSats from educational institutions. The specification does not apply to other cube-like nanosatellites such as the NASA \\"MEPSI\\" nanosatellite, which is slightly larger than a CubeSat. GeneSat-1 was NASA's first fully automated, self-contained biological spaceflight experiment on a satellite of its size. It was also the first U.S.-launched CubeSat. This work, led by John Hines at NASA Ames Research, became the catalyst for the entire NASA CubeSat program. Design The CubeSat specification accomplishes several high-level goals. The main reason for miniaturizing satellites is to reduce the cost of deployment: they are often suitable for launch in multiples, using the excess capacity of larger launch vehicles. The CubeSat design specifically minimizes risk to the rest of the launch vehicle and payloads. Encapsulation of the launcher‚Äìpayload interface takes away the amount of work that would previously be required for mating a piggyback satellite with its launcher. Unification among payloads and launchers enables quick exchanges of payloads and utilization of launch opportunities on short notice. Standard CubeSats are made up of 10√ó10√ó11.35 cm units designed to provide 10√ó10√ó10 cm or 1 liter of useful volume while weighing no more than per unit. The smallest standard size is 1U, while 3U+ is composed of three units stacked lengthwise with an additional 6.4 cm diameter cylinder centered on the long axis and extending 3.6 cm beyond one face. The Aerospace Corporation has constructed and launched two smaller form CubeSats of 0.5U for radiation measurement and technological demonstration. Scientist holding a CubeSat chassis Since nearly all CubeSats are 10√ó10 cm (regardless of length) they can all be launched and deployed using a common deployment system called a Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD), developed and built by Cal Poly. No electronics form factors or communications protocols are specified or required by the CubeSat Design Specification, but COTS hardware has consistently utilized certain features which many treat as standards in CubeSat electronics. Most COTS and custom designed electronics fit the form of PC/104, which was not designed for CubeSats but presents a 90 √ó 96 mm profile that allows most of the spacecraft's volume to be occupied. Technically, the PCI-104 form is the variant of PC/104 used and the actual pinout used does not reflect the pinout specified in the PCI-104 standard. Stackthrough connectors on the boards allow for simple assembly and electrical interfacing and most manufacturers of CubeSat electronics hardware hold to the same signal arrangement, but some products do not, so care must be taken to ensure consistent signal and power arrangements to prevent damage. Care must be taken in electronics selection to ensure the devices can tolerate the radiation present. For very low Earth orbits (LEO) in which atmospheric reentry would occur in just days or weeks, radiation can largely be ignored and standard consumer grade electronics may be used. Consumer electronic devices can survive LEO radiation for that time as the chance of a single event upset (SEU) is very low. Spacecraft in a sustained low Earth orbit lasting months or years are at risk and only fly hardware designed for and tested in irradiated environments. Missions beyond low Earth orbit or which would remain in low Earth orbit for many years must use radiation-hardened devices. Further considerations are made for operation in high vacuum due to the effects of sublimation, outgassing, and metal whiskers, which may result in mission failure. Different classifications are used to categorize such miniature satellites based on mass. 1U CubeSats belong to the genre of picosatellites. #Minisatellite (100‚Äì500 kg) #Microsatellite (10‚Äì100 kg) #Nanosatellite (1‚Äì10 kg) #Picosatellite (0.1‚Äì1 kg) #Femtosatellite (0.01‚Äì0.1 kg) In recent years larger CubeSat platforms have been developed, most commonly 6U (10√ó20√ó30 cm or 12√ó24√ó36 cmThe official standard only defines up to 3U and 3U+ (a slightly larger but same-mass 3U). Larger sizes use have varying definitions depending on source. There is some confusion about 3U and 1U: the official standard claims a 3U masses at most 4 kg, while Spaceflight Services claims (see ) that 3U extends to 5 kg.) and 12U (20x20x30 cm or 24x24x36 cm), to extend the capabilities of CubeSats beyond academic and technology validation applications and into more complex science and national defense goals. In 2014 two 6U Perseus-M CubeSats were launched for maritime surveillance, the largest yet at the time. The 2018 launch of the InSight lander to Mars included two 6U CubeSats called Mars Cube One (MarCO). Most CubeSats carry one or two scientific instruments as their primary mission payload. Structure The number of joined units classifies the size of CubeSats and according to the CubeSat Design Specification are scalable along only one axis to fit the forms of 0.5U, 1U, 1.5U, 2U, or 3U. All the standard sizes of CubeSat have been built and launched, and represent the form factors for nearly all launched CubeSats as of 2015. Materials used in the structure must feature the same coefficient of thermal expansion as the deployer to prevent jamming. Specifically, allowed materials are four aluminum alloys: 7075, 6061, 5005, and 5052. Aluminum used on the structure which contacts the P-POD must be anodized to prevent cold welding, and other materials may be used for the structure if a waiver is obtained. Beyond cold welding, further consideration is put into material selection as not all materials can be used in vacuums. Structures often feature soft dampers at each end, typically made of rubber, to lessen the effects of impacting other CubeSats in the P-POD. Protrusions beyond the maximum dimensions are allowed by the standard specification, to a maximum of 6.5 mm beyond each side. Any protrusions may not interfere with the deployment rails and are typically occupied by antennas and solar panels. In Revision 13 of the CubeSat Design Specification an extra available volume was defined for use on 3U projects. The additional volume is made possible by space typically wasted in the P-POD Mk III's spring mechanism. 3U CubeSats which utilize the space are designated 3U+ and may place components in a cylindrical volume centered on one end of the CubeSat. The cylindrical space has a maximum diameter of 6.4 cm and a height no greater than 3.6 cm while not allowing for any increase in mass beyond the 3U's maximum of 4 kg. Propulsion systems and antennas are the most common components that might require the additional volume, though the payload sometimes extends into this volume. Deviations from the dimension and mass requirements can be waived following application and negotiation with the launch service provider. CubeSat structures do not have all the same strength concerns as larger satellites do, as they have the added benefit of the deployer supporting them structurally during launch. Still, some CubeSats will undergo vibration analysis or structural analysis to ensure that components unsupported by the P-POD remain structurally sound throughout the launch. Despite rarely undergoing the analysis that larger satellites do, CubeSats rarely fail due to mechanical issues. Computing Like larger satellites, CubeSats often feature multiple computers handling different tasks in parallel including the attitude control (orientation), power management, payload operation, and primary control tasks. COTS attitude control systems typically include their own computer, as do the power management systems. Payloads must be able to interface with the primary computer to be useful, which sometimes requires the use of another small computer. This may be due to limitations in the primary computer's ability to control the payload with limited communication protocols, to prevent overloading the primary computer with raw data handling, or to ensure payload's operation continues uninterrupted by the spacecraft's other computing needs such as communication. Still, the primary computer may be used for payload related tasks, which might include image processing, data analysis, and data compression. Tasks which the primary computer typically handles include the delegation of tasks to the other computers, attitude control (orientation), calculations for orbital maneuvers, scheduling, and activation of active thermal control components. CubeSat computers are highly susceptible to radiation and builders will take special steps to ensure proper operation in the high radiation of space, such as the use of ECC RAM. Some satellites may incorporate redundancy by implementing multiple primary computers, this could be done on valuable missions to lessen the risk of mission failure. Consumer smartphones have been used for computing in some CubeSats, such as NASA's PhoneSats. Attitude control Near-Earth Asteroid Scout concept: a controllable solar sail CubeSat Attitude control (orientation) for CubeSats relies on miniaturizing technology without significant performance degradation. Tumbling typically occurs as soon as a CubeSat is deployed, due to asymmetric deployment forces and bumping with other CubeSats. Some CubeSats operate normally while tumbling, but those that require pointing in a certain direction or cannot operate safely while spinning, must be detumbled. Systems that perform attitude determination and control include reaction wheels, magnetorquers, thrusters, star trackers, Sun sensors, Earth sensors, angular rate sensors, and GPS receivers and antennas. Combinations of these systems are typically seen in order to take each method's advantages and mitigate their shortcomings. Reaction wheels are commonly utilized for their ability to impart relatively large moments for any given energy input, but reaction wheel's utility is limited due to saturation, the point at which a wheel cannot spin faster. Examples of CubeSat reaction wheels include the Maryland Aerospace MAI-101 and the Sinclair Interplanetary RW-0.03-4. Reaction wheels can be desaturated with the use of thrusters or magnetorquers. Thrusters can provide large moments by imparting a couple on the spacecraft but inefficiencies in small propulsion systems cause thrusters to run out of fuel rapidly. Commonly found on nearly all CubeSats are magnetorquers which run electricity through a solenoid to take advantage of Earth's magnetic field to produce a turning moment. Attitude-control modules and solar panels typically feature built-in magnetorquers. For CubeSats that only need to detumble, no attitude determination method beyond an angular rate sensor or electronic gyroscope is necessary. Pointing in a specific direction is necessary for Earth observation, orbital maneuvers, maximizing solar power, and some scientific instruments. Directional pointing accuracy can be achieved by sensing Earth and its horizon, the Sun, or specific stars. Sinclair Interplanetary's SS-411 sun sensor and ST-16 star tracker both have applications for CubeSats and have flight heritage. Pumpkin's Colony I Bus uses an aerodynamic wing for passive attitude stabilization. Determination of a CubeSat's location can be done through the use of on-board GPS, which is relatively expensive for a CubeSat, or by relaying radar tracking data to the craft from Earth-based tracking systems.  Propulsion  CubeSat propulsion has made rapid advancements in the following technologies: cold gas, chemical propulsion, electric propulsion, and solar sails. The biggest challenge with CubeSat propulsion is preventing risk to the launch vehicle and its primary payload while still providing significant capability. Components and methods that are commonly used in larger satellites are disallowed or limited, and the CubeSat Design Specification (CDS) requires a waiver for pressurization above 1.2 standard atmospheres, over 100 Wh of stored chemical energy, and hazardous materials. Those restrictions pose great challenges for CubeSat propulsion systems, as typical space propulsion systems utilize combinations of high pressures, high energy densities, and hazardous materials. Beyond the restrictions set forth by launch service providers, various technical challenges further reduce the usefulness of CubeSat propulsion. Gimbaled thrust cannot be used in small engines due to the complexity of gimbaling mechanisms, thrust vectoring must instead be achieved by thrusting asymmetrically in multiple-nozzle propulsion systems or by changing the center of mass relative to the CubeSat's geometry with actuated components. Small motors may also not have room for throttling methods that allow smaller than fully on thrust, which is important for precision maneuvers such as rendezvous. CubeSats which require longer life also benefit from propulsion systems, when used for orbit keeping a propulsion system can slow orbital decay. = Cold gas thrusters = A cold gas thruster typically stores inert gas, such as nitrogen, in a pressurized tank and releases the gas through a nozzle to produce thrust. Operation is handled by just a single valve in most systems, which makes cold gas the simplest useful propulsion technology. Cold gas propulsion systems can be very safe since the gases used do not have to be volatile or corrosive, though some systems opt to feature dangerous gases such as sulfur dioxide. This ability to use inert gases is highly advantageous to CubeSats as they are usually restricted from hazardous materials. Unfortunately, only low performance can be achieved with them, preventing high impulse maneuvers even in low mass CubeSats. Due to this low performance, their use in CubeSats for main propulsion is limited and designers choose higher efficiency systems with only minor increases in complexity. Cold gas systems more often see use in CubeSat attitude control. = Chemical propulsion = Chemical propulsion systems use a chemical reaction to produce a high-pressure, high-temperature gas that accelerates out of a nozzle. Chemical propellant can be liquid, solid or a hybrid of both. Liquid propellants can be a monopropellant passed through a catalyst, or bipropellant which combusts an oxidizer and a fuel. The benefits of monopropellants are relatively low-complexity/high-thrust output, low power requirements, and high reliability. Monopropellant motors tend to have high thrust while remaining comparatively simple, which also provides high reliability. These motors are practical for CubeSats due to their low power requirements and because their simplicity allows them to be very small. Small hydrazine fueled motors have been developed, but may require a waiver to fly due to restrictions on hazardous chemicals set forth in the CubeSat Design Specification. Safer chemical propellants which would not require hazardous chemical waivers are being developed, such as AF-M315 (hydroxylammonium nitrate) for which motors are being or have been designed. A \\"Water Electrolysis Thruster\\" is technically a chemical propulsion system, as it burns hydrogen and oxygen which it generates by on-orbit electrolysis of water. = Electric propulsion = Busek's BIT-3 ion thruster proposed for NASA's Lunar IceCube mission CubeSat electric propulsion typically uses electric energy to accelerate propellant to high speed, which results in high specific impulse. Many of these technologies can be made small enough for use in nanosatellites, and several methods are in development. Types of electric propulsion currently being designed for use in CubeSats include Hall-effect thrusters, ion thrusters, pulsed plasma thrusters, electrospray thrusters, and resistojets. Several notable CubeSat missions plan to use electric propulsion, such as NASA's Lunar IceCube. The high efficiency associated with electric propulsion could allow CubeSats to propel themselves to Mars. Electric propulsion systems are disadvantaged in their use of power, which requires the CubeSat to have larger solar cells, more complicated power distribution, and often larger batteries. Furthermore, many electric propulsion methods may still require pressurized tanks to store propellant, which is restricted by the CubeSat Design Specification. The ESTCube-1 used an electric solar-wind sail, which is nothing like a solar sail, despite its name. This technology used an electric field to deflect protons from solar wind to produce thrust. It is similar to an electrodynamic tether in that the craft only needs to supply electricity to operate. = Solar sail = Solar sails (also called light sails or photon sails) are a form of spacecraft propulsion using the radiation pressure (also called solar pressure) from stars to push large ultra-thin mirrors to high speeds, requiring no propellant. Force from a solar sail scales with the sail's area, this makes sails well suited for use in CubeSats as their small mass results in the greater acceleration for a given solar sail's area. However, solar sails still need to be quite large compared to the satellite, which means useful solar sails must be deployed, adding mechanical complexity and a potential source of failure. This propulsion method is the only one not plagued with restrictions set by the CubeSat Design Specification, as it does not require high pressures, hazardous materials, or significant chemical energy. Few CubeSats have employed a solar sail as its main propulsion and stability in deep space, including the 3U NanoSail-D2 launched in 2010, and the LightSail-1 in May 2015. CubeSail is currently testing in orbit a -long, solar sail ribbon extended between two CubeSats, that will inform the design for a much larger concept called UltraSail heliogyro. LightSail-2 successfully deployed on a Falcon Heavy rocket in 2019, while at least one CubeSat that plan to launch on the Space Launch System's first flight (Artemis 1) in 2021 is set to use a solar sail: the Near-Earth Asteroid Scout (NEA Scout). Power Winglet solar panels increase surface area for power generation CubeSats use solar cells to convert solar light to electricity that is then stored in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that provide power during eclipse as well as during peak load times. These satellites have a limited surface area on their external walls for solar cells assembly, and has to be effectively shared with other parts, such as antennas, optical sensors, camera lens, propulsion systems, and access ports. Lithium-ion batteries feature high energy-to-mass ratios, making them well suited to use on mass-restricted spacecraft. Battery charging and discharging is typically handled by a dedicated electrical power system (EPS). Batteries sometimes feature heaters to prevent the battery from reaching dangerously low temperatures which might cause battery and mission failure. The rate at which the batteries decay depends on the number of cycles for which they are charged and discharged, as well as the depth of each discharge: the greater the average depth of discharge, the faster a battery degrades. For LEO missions, the number of cycles of discharge can be expected to be on the order of several hundred. Due to size and weight constraints, common CubeSats flying in LEO with body- mounted solar panels have generated less than 10 W. Missions with higher power requirements can make use of attitude control to ensure the solar panels remain in their most effective orientation toward the Sun, and further power needs can be met through the addition and orientation of deployed solar arrays. Recent innovations include additional spring-loaded solar arrays that deploy as soon as the satellite is released, as well as arrays that feature thermal knife mechanisms that would deploy the panels when commanded. CubeSats may not be powered between launch and deployment, and must feature a remove- before-flight pin which cuts all power to prevent operation during loading into the P-POD. Additionally, a deployment switch is actuated while the craft is loaded into a P-POD, cutting power to the spacecraft and is deactivated after exiting the P-POD. Telecommunications Deployable high-gain mesh reflector antenna operating at Ka-band for the Radar in a Cubesat (Raincube). The low cost of CubeSats has enabled unprecedented access to space for smaller institutions and organizations but, for most CubeSat forms, the range and available power is limited to about 2W for its communications antennae. Because of tumbling and low power range, radio-communications are a challenge. Many CubeSats use an omnidirectional monopole or dipole antenna built with commercial measuring tape. For more demanding needs, some companies offer high-gain antennae for CubeSats, but their deployment and pointing systems are significantly more complex. For example, MIT and JPL are developing an inflatable dish antenna with a useful range to the Moon but appears to be poorly efficient. JPL has successfully developed X-band and Ka-band high-gain antennas for MarCO and Radar in a CubeSat (RaInCube) missions.  Antennas  Traditionally, Low Earth Orbit Cubesats use antennas for communication purpose at UHF and S-band. To venture farther in the solar system, larger antennas compatible with the Deep Space Network (X-band and Ka-band) are required. JPL's engineers developed several deployable high-gain antennas compatible with 6U-class CubeSats for MarCO and Near-Earth Asteroid Scout. JPL's engineers have also developed a 0.5m mesh reflector antenna operating at Ka-band and compatible with the DSN that folds in a 1.5U stowage volume. For MarCO, JPL's antenna engineers designed a Folded Panel Reflectarray (FPR) to fit on a 6U Cubesat bus and supports X-band Mars-to-Earth telecommunications at 8kbit/s at 1AU.  Thermal management  Different CubeSat components possess different acceptable temperature ranges, beyond which they may become temporarily or permanently inoperable. Satellites in orbit are heated by radiative heat emitted from the Sun directly and reflected off Earth, as well as heat generated by the craft's components. CubeSats must also cool by radiating heat either into space or into the cooler Earth's surface, if it is cooler than the spacecraft. All of these radiative heat sources and sinks are rather constant and very predictable, so long as the CubeSat's orbit and eclipse time are known. Components used to ensure the temperature requirements are met in CubeSats include multi-layer insulation and heaters for the battery. Other spacecraft thermal control techniques in small satellites include specific component placement based on expected thermal output of those components and, rarely, deployed thermal devices such as louvers. Analysis and simulation of the spacecraft's thermal model is an important determining factor in applying thermal management components and techniques. CubeSats with special thermal concerns, often associated with certain deployment mechanisms and payloads, may be tested in a thermal vacuum chamber before launch. Such testing provides a larger degree of assurance than full-sized satellites can receive, since CubeSats are small enough to fit inside of a thermal vacuum chamber in their entirety. Temperature sensors are typically placed on different CubeSat components so that action may be taken to avoid dangerous temperature ranges, such as reorienting the craft in order to avoid or introduce direct thermal radiation to a specific part, thereby allowing it to cool or heat. Costs CubeSat forms a cost-effective independent means of getting a payload into orbit. After delays from low-cost launchers such as Interorbital Systems,As noted in the linked article, Interorbital promised its Neptune 45 ‚Äì intended to carry ten CubeSats, among other cargo ‚Äì would launch in 2011, but as of 2014 it had yet to do so. launch prices have been about $100,000 per unit, but newer operators are offering lower pricing.\\"Space Is Open For Business, Online\\", rocketlabusa.com Some CubeSats have complicated components or instruments, such as LightSail-1, that pushes their construction cost into the millions, but a basic 1U CubeSat can cost about $50,000 to construct so CubeSats are a viable option for some schools and universities; as well as small businesses to develop CubeSats for commercial purposes. Notable past missions NanoRacks CubeSats being launched from the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer on the ISS on February 25, 2014. The searchable Nanosatellite database lists almost 2,000 CubeSats that have been launched since 1998. One of the earliest CubeSat launches was on 30 June 2003 from Plesetsk, Russia, with Eurockot Launch Services's Multiple Orbit Mission. CubeSats were put into a Sun-synchronous orbit and included the Danish AAU CubeSat and DTUSat, the Japanese XI-IV and CUTE-1, the Canadian Can X-1, and the US Quakesat. On February 13, 2012, three PPODs deployers containing seven CubeSats were placed into orbit along with the Lares satellite aboard a Vega rocket launched from French Guiana. The CubeSats launched were e-st@r Space (Politecnico di Torino, Italy), Goliat (University of Bucarest, Romania), MaSat-1 (Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary), PW-Sat (Warsaw University of Technology, Poland), Robusta (University of Montpellier 2, France), UniCubeSat-GG (University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy), and XaTcobeo (University of Vigo and INTA, Spain). The CubeSats were launched in the framework of the \\"Vega Maiden Flight\\" opportunity of the European Space Agency. On September 13, 2012, eleven CubeSats were launched from eight P-PODs, as part of the \\"OutSat\\" secondary payload aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. This was the largest number of CubeSats (and largest volume of 24U) successfully placed to orbit on a single launch, this was made possible by use of the new NPS CubeSat Launcher system (NPSCuL) developed at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). The following CubeSats were placed in orbit: SMDC-ONE 2.2 (Baker), SMDC-ONE 2.1 (Able), AeroCube 4.0(x3), Aeneas, CSSWE, CP5, CXBN, CINEMA, and Re (STARE). Five CubeSats (Raiko, Niwaka, We- Wish, TechEdSat, F-1) were placed into orbit from the International Space Station on October 4, 2012, as a technology demonstration of small satellite deployment from the ISS. They were launched and delivered to ISS as a cargo of Kounotori 3, and an ISS astronaut prepared the deployment mechanism attached to Japanese Experiment Module's robotic arm. Four CubeSats were deployed from the Cygnus Mass Simulator, which was launched April 21, 2013 on the maiden flight of Orbital Sciences' Antares rocket. Three of them are 1U PhoneSats built by NASA's Ames Research Center to demonstrate the use of smart phones as avionics in CubeSats. The fourth was a 3U satellite, called Dove-1, built by Planet Labs. A total of thirty-three CubeSats were deployed from the ISS on February 11, 2014. Of those thirty-three, twenty-eight were part of the Flock-1 constellation of Earth-imaging CubeSats. Of the other five, two are from other US-based companies, two from Lithuania, and one from Peru. The LightSail-1 is a 3U CubeSat prototype propelled by a solar sail. It was launched on 20 May 2015 from Florida. Its four sails are made of very thin Mylar and have a total area of 32 m2. This test will allow a full checkout of the satellite's systems in advance of the main 2016 mission. On October 5, 2015, AAUSAT5 (Aalborg University, Denmark), was deployed from the ISS. launched in the framework of the \\"Fly Your Satellite!\\" programme of the European Space Agency. The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer CubeSat is a 3U launched to the International Space Station on 6 December 2015 from where it was deployed on 16 May 2016. It is the first mission launched in the NASA Science Mission Directorate CubeSat Integration Panel,NASA Briefing to Committee on Achieving Science Goals with CubeSats which is focused on doing science with CubeSats. As of 12 July 2016, the minimum mission success criteria (one month of science observations) has been met, but the spacecraft continues to perform nominally and observations continue. Three CubeSats were launched on April 25, 2016 together with Sentinel-1B on a Soyuz rocket VS14 launched from Kourou, French Guiana. The satellites were: AAUSAT4 (Aalborg University, Denmark), e-st@r-II (Politecnico di Torino, Italy) and OUFTI-1 (Universit√© de Li√®ge, Belgium). The CubeSats were launched in the framework of the \\"Fly Your Satellite!\\" programme of the European Space Agency. On February 15, 2017 Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) set record with the launch of 104 satellites on a single rocket. The launch of PSLV-C37 in a single payload, including the Cartosat-2 series and 103 co-passenger satellites, together weighed over 650 kg (1,433 lb). Of the 104 satellites, all but three were CubeSats. Of the 101 nano satellites, 96 were from the United States and one each from Israel, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. 2018 InSight mission: MarCO CubeSats An artist's rendering of MarCO A and B during the descent of InSight The May 2018 launch of the InSight stationary Mars lander included two CubeSats to flyby Mars to provide additional relay communications from InSight to Earth during entry and landing. This is the first flight of CubeSats in deep space. The mission CubeSat technology is called Mars Cube One (MarCO), each one is a six-unit CubeSat, 14.4 inches (36.6 centimeters) by 9.5 inches (24.3 centimeters) by 4.6 inches (11.8 centimeters). MarCo is an experiment, but not necessary for the InSight mission, to add relay communications to space missions in important time durations, in this case from the time of InSight atmospheric entry to its landing. MarCO launched in May 2018 with the InSight lander, separated after launch and then traveled in their own trajectories to Mars. After separation, both MarCO spacecraft deployed two radio antennas and two solar panels. The high-gain, X band antenna is a flat panel to direct radio waves. MarCO navigated to Mars independently from the InSight lander, making their own course adjustments on the flight. During InSight entry, descent and landing (EDL) in November 2018, the lander transmitted telemetry in the UHF radio band to NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) flying overhead. MRO forwarded EDL information to Earth using a radio frequency in the X band, but cannot simultaneously receive information in one band if transmitting on another. Confirmation of a successful landing could be received on Earth several hours after, so MarCO was a technology demonstration of real-time telemetry during the landing. US programs NanoRacks CubeSat Launch Initiative NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative,CubeSat Launch Initiative created in 2010, provides CubeSat launch opportunities to educational institutions, non-profit organizations and NASA Centers. Since its inception the CubeSat Launch Initiative has launched 46 CubeSats flown on 12 ELaNa Missions from 28 unique organizations and has selected 119 CubeSat missions from 66 unique organizations. Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) missions have included: BisonSat the first CubeSat built by a tribal college, TJ3Sat the first CubeSat built by a high school and STMSat-1 the first CubeSat built by an elementary school. NASA releases an Announcement of OpportunityAnnouncement of Opportunity in August of each year with selections made the following February.  Artemis 1  NASA initiated the Cube Quest Challenge in 2015, a competition to foster innovation in the use of CubeSats beyond low Earth orbit. The Cube Quest Challenge offers a total of $5 million to teams that meet the challenge objectives of designing, building and delivering flight-qualified, small satellites capable of advanced operations near and beyond the Moon. Teams compete for a variety of prizes in lunar orbit or deep space. 13 CubeSats from different teams are planned be launched to cislunar space between 2020‚Äì2021 as secondary payloads on board the Artemis 1.  Artemis 2  European programs \\"Fly Your Satellite!\\" is the recurring CubeSats programme of the Education Office of the European Space Agency. University students have the opportunity to develop and implement their CubeSat mission with support of ESA specialists.Fly Your Satellite! ESA. Participating student teams can experience the full cycle from designing, building, and testing to eventually, the possibility of launching and operating their CubeSat. International projects QB50 QB50 is a proposed international network of 50 CubeSats for multi-point, in-situ measurements in the lower thermosphere (90‚Äì350 km) and re-entry research. QB50 is an initiative of the Von Karman Institute and is funded by the European Commission as part of the 7th Framework Programme (FP7). Double-unit (2U) CubeSats (10√ó10√ó20 cm) are developed, with one unit (the 'functional' unit) providing the usual satellite functions and the other unit (the 'science' unit) accommodating a set of standardised sensors for lower thermosphere and re-entry research. 35 CubeSats are envisaged to be provided by universities from 22 countries around the world, among them 4 are from the US, 4 from China, 4 from France, 3 from Australia and 3 from South Korea. Ten 2U or 3U CubeSats are foreseen to serve for in-orbit technology demonstration of new space technologies. The Request for Proposals (RFP) for the QB50 CubeSat was released on February 15, 2012. Two \\"precursor\\" QB50 satellites were launched aboard a Dnepr rocket on June 19, 2014. All 50 CubeSats were supposed to be launched together on a single Cyclone-4 launch vehicle in February 2016, but due to the unavailability of the launch vehicle, 36 satellites were launched aboard Cygnus CRS OA-7 on 18 April 2017 and subsequently deployed from the ISS. A dozen other CubeSats have been manifested on the PSLV-XL C38 mission in May 2017. Launch and deployment Dnepr rocket launching from ISC Kosmotras Unlike full-sized spacecraft, CubeSats have the ability to be delivered into space as cargo and then deployed by the International Space Station. This presents an alternative method of achieving orbit apart from launch and deployment by a launch vehicle. NanoRacks and Made in Space are developing means of constructing CubeSats on the International Space Station.  Current launch systems  NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative launched more than 46 CubeSats on its ELaNa missions over the several years prior to 2016, and as of that time, 57 were manifested for flight over the next several years. No matter how inexpensive or versatile CubeSats may be, they must hitch rides as secondary payloads on large rockets launching much larger spacecraft, at prices starting around $100,000 as of 2015. Since CubeSats are deployed by P-PODs and similar deployment systems, they can be integrated and launched into virtually any launch vehicle. However, some launch service providers refuse to launch CubeSats, whether on all launches or only on specific launches, two examples were ILS and Sea Launch. SpaceX and Japan Manned Space Systems Corporation (JAMSS) are two recent companies that offer commercial launch services for CubeSats as secondary payload, but a launch backlog still exists. Additionally, India's ISRO has been commercially launching foreign CubeSats since 2009 as secondary payloads. On 15 Feb 2017, ISRO set the world record by launching 103 CubeSats on board its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle for various foreign companies ISC Kosmotras and Eurockot also offer launch services for CubeSats. Rocket Lab specializes in launching CubeSats on its Electron (rocket) from New Zealand.  Future and proposed launch systems  On 5 May 2015, NASA announced a program based at the Kennedy Space Center dedicated to develop a new class of rockets designed specifically to launch very small satellites: the NASA Venture Class Launch Services (VCLS), which will offer a payload mass of 30 kg to 60 kg for each launcher. Five months later, in October 2015, NASA awarded a total of $17.1 million to three separate startup launch companies for one flight each: $6.9 million to Rocket Lab (Electron rocket); $5.5 million to Firefly Space Systems (Alpha rocket); and $4.7 million to Virgin Galactic (LauncherOne rocket). The payloads for the three flights under the VCLS contract have not yet been assigned. Other small satellite launch systems are under development that would carry CubeSats alongside a small payload, including the Neptune series of rockets by Interorbital Systems, Garvey Spacecraft's Nanosat Launch Vehicle, and the SPARK rocket. In addition to conventional launch vehicles and launch facilitators like KSF Space, several air launch to orbit vehicles are in the works by Swiss Space Systems, Generation Orbit Launch Services, and Boeing (in the form of their Small Launch Vehicle). As of December 2015, only one launch vehicle that emphasizes small CubeSat payloads has made a launch attempt, the SPARK, broke up shortly after launch on 4 November 2015. The rocket was carrying 12 CubeSats of various sizes along with its 55 kilogram primary payload. Many of the aforementioned characteristics or properties of CubeSats such as structure, propulsion, material, computing and telecommunications, power, and any additional specific instruments or measurement devices pose challenges to the expansion of use of CubeSat technology beyond Earth's orbit. These challenges have been increasingly under consideration of international organizations over the past decade, for example, proposed in 2012 by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Lab, the INSPIRE spacecraft is an initial attempt at a spacecraft designed to prove the operational abilities of deep space CubeSats. The launch date was expected to be 2014, but has yet to do so and the date is currently listed by NASA as TBD. Testing is under way at a new rocket launch site in Koonibba, South Australia, by Southern Launch. A rocket containing a small replica payload is scheduled to be launched from the site on 15 September 2020, aimed at collecting information to develop cubesats developed by DEWC Systems in Adelaide.  Deployment  CSSWE next to its P-POD before integration and launch P-PODs (Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployers) were designed with CubeSats to provide a common platform for secondary payloads. P-PODs are mounted to a launch vehicle and carry CubeSats into orbit and deploy them once the proper signal is received from the launch vehicle. The P-POD Mk III has capacity for three 1U CubeSats, or other 0.5U, 1U, 1.5U, 2U, or 3U CubeSats combination up to a maximum volume of 3U. Other CubeSat deployers exist, with the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD) on the International Space Station being the most popular method of CubeSat deployment as of 2014. Some CubeSat deployers are created by companies, such as the ISIPOD (Innovative Solutions In Space BV) or SPL (Astro und Feinwerktechnik Adlershof GmbH), while some have been created by governments or other non-profit institutions such as the X-POD (University of Toronto), T-POD (University of Tokyo), or the J-SSOD (JAXA) on the International Space Station. While the P-POD is limited to launching a 3U CubeSat at most, the NRCSD can launch a 6U (10√ó10√ó68.1 cm) CubeSat and the ISIPOD can launch a different form of 6U CubeSat (10√ó22.63√ó34.05 cm). While nearly all CubeSats are deployed from a launch vehicle or the International Space Station, some are deployed by the primary payloads themselves. For example, FASTSAT deployed the NanoSail-D2, a 3U CubeSat. This was done again with the Cygnus Mass Simulator as the primary payload launched on the maiden flight of the Antares rocket, carrying and later deploying four CubeSats. For CubeSat applications beyond Earth's orbit, the method of deploying the satellites from the primary payload will also be adopted. Eleven CubeSats are planned to be launched on the Artemis 1, which would place them in the vicinity of the Moon. InSight, a Mars lander, also brought CubeSats beyond Earth orbit to use them as relay communications satellites. Known as MarCO A and B, they are the first CubeSats sent beyond the Earth‚ÄìMoon system. Chasqui I saw a unique deployment process, when it was deployed by hand during a spacewalk on the International Space Station in 2014.

The park opened in 1976 to coincide with bicentennial celebrations and is operated and maintained by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry. Liberty State Park covers . The main part of the park is bordered by water on three sides: on the north by the Morris Canal Big Basin and on the south and east by Upper New York Bay. The New Jersey Turnpike Newark Bay Extension (I-78) marks its western perimeter. Geography left Most of the park's area is on landfill created by the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CRRNJ) and the Lehigh Valley Railroad, defunct companies whose lines once terminated there. In the northeast corner of the park is the CRRNJ Terminal, a historic transportation building. Statue Cruises offers ferries to Statue of Liberty National Monument, Ellis Island and Liberty Island that depart nearby. A section of track from the Lehigh Valley Railroad can be found in the park. The southern Caven Point section of the park is separated from the main part of the park by the Liberty National Golf Club and is accessible along the water's edge using the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway. The long thin pier at the foot of Chapel Avenue that was once part of the park has been demolished. The Peninsula Park lies between the Big Basin of the Morris Canal and the Tidewater Basin in Paulus Hook. The Liberty Landing Marina is located on the Big Basin. Communipaw Cove is part of the state nature preserve in the park and is one of the few remaining tidal salt marshes along the Hudson River estuary. The Interpretive Center, designed by architect Michael Graves, is part of the preserve. To the west lies the Interior Natural Area, which is off limits to the public and is being allowed through natural processes to recover from environmental abuse. The park is also the only state park in Essex, Hudson, and Bergen counties. Another section of the park is called Liberty Industrial Park. History left Much of the park is situated on landfilled tidal flats that formerly supported vast oyster banks as part of the territory of the Hackensack Indians, who called the area Communipaw and used it as a summer encampment. In the seventeenth century it became part of the colonial province of New Netherland, the patroonship Pavonia. The area was known as Jan the Lacher's Hook, so called for the man who was the bowery's second superintendent, Jan Everts Bout. For many years, the village, often referred to by Washington Irving, existed where the Liberty Science Center now stands. For hundreds of years it was a ferry port for local communities of Bergen, Bergen Township, and Hudson County, as well suburban and long-distance travelers to Manhattan. In the latter half of 19th century, a small island named Black Tom was joined via landfill with the mainland. It became a major shipping, manufacturing, and transportation hub within Port of New York and New Jersey, leading to the construction of Communipaw Terminal. It was from this ferry/train station that many immigrants arriving at Ellis Island spread out across the USA. In 1916, on what is now the southeastern corner of the park, the Black Tom explosion killed as many as seven people, caused $20 million in property damage, and was felt throughout the Tri-State Region. Before opening, LSP was the site of abandoned rail facilities built on landfills Construction of the North River Tunnels, containerization, and the Interstate Highway System, made the area less viable. The decline of industry, deterioration of rail and maritime infrastructure, and toxic waste, eventually made the area obsolete. Abandoned buildings and brownfields dominated the landscape after the mid-twentieth century, though there was still some manufacturing and recreational use. Audrey Zapp, Theodore Conrad, Morris Pesin and J. Owen Grundy were influential environmentalists and historians who spearheaded the movement that led to the creation of Liberty State Park. They are remembered by the naming of places and streets along the waterfront. It is estimated the park suffered $20 million in damages during Superstorm Sandy in October 2012. In June 2016, the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal reopened after a $20 million renovation to repair the extensive damage caused by Sandy. As of December 2019, the Nature Interpretive Center remains closed due to storm damage. No timeline has been given for its completion. On January 11, 2018, it was announced by New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) that the interior of the park that have been closed off to the public for decades due to environmental contamination would be remediated into an urban marshland and forest. The restoration is to be done in phases with the initial phase focusing on a parcel of the interior. The marshland will be fed by a new channel connecting the Hudson River to the park's interior. There is currently no timeline yet for the remediation but the funding is to come from natural resource damage settlements. Work would begin in 2021. Points of interest Freedom Way and Liberty Walkway A road called Freedom Way goes through the center and serves as a barrier between the area closed to the public, to its west, and the area that is open to the public, to its east. It has many bike paths, walkways, and fields. A common tern seen from the park with Manhattan in the background Liberty Walkway, a crescent-shaped promenade, stretches from the CRRNJ Terminal along the waterfront south to the Statue of Liberty overlook, bridging two coves along the way. It is part of the longer Hudson River Waterfront Walkway. Halfway along Liberty Walkway is a bridge to Ellis Island, but only authorized vehicles are allowed. The southeastern corner of the park contains the Statue of Liberty overlook, picnic facilities, a playground, the U.S. Flag Plaza and Liberation Monument, the Public Administration Building, and a memorial to the Black Tom explosions. Picnicking and barbecuing facilities are also located at the southern end of the park.

Liberty Science Center The Liberty Science Center, at the northwestern entrance to the park, is an interactive science museum and learning center. The center opened in 1993 as New Jersey's first major state science museum. It has science exhibits, the world's 5th largest IMAX Dome theater, the largest planetarium in the Western Hemisphere, numerous educational resources, and the original Hoberman sphere, a silver, computer- driven engineering artwork designed by Chuck Hoberman.NJ Department of Parks and Forests Liberty Science Center Monuments and memorials Empty Sky Memorial with a remnant from the World Trade Center in the foreground Liberation is a 1985 bronze sculpture designed by Nathan Rapoport as a memorial to the Holocaust, showing a U.S. soldier carrying out a survivor from a Nazi death camp.\\"Art and Architecture of New Jersey,\\" ETTC.net , retrieved May 10, 2011.

The \\"Sail\\" sits atop a stone base in the shape of a ship and features scenes of Columbus and his travels. It was dedicated from the Government of Italy and the City of Genoa in 1998. Empty Sky is the official state memorial to the September 11 attacks of the World Trade Center. Situated on a berm the parallel walls engraved with the names of victims are oriented to face the former World Trade Center site. Designed by architect Frederic Schwartz, it was dedicated on September 10, 2011, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the attacks.NJ 911 Memorial page , retrieved February 20, 2011. In July 2008, Friends of Liberty State Park filed a lawsuit to block the creation of the 9/11 memorial stating that New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) did not provide enough public comment and did not authorize a proper permit linked to the project. The Friends of Liberty State Park is led by Sam Pesin, the son of Morris Pesin, who first lobbied for the creation of Liberty State Park. Sam Pesin stated that \\"The consensus [of park users] is that the memorial as proposed is a massive monstrosity that obstructs powerful views that need protection for future generations,\\" he declared. Proposed commercial activities The administration of Governor Chris Christie proposed various commercial activities for the park. In 2017, it suggested leasing large parts of the waterfront for private marinas. Caven Point is a 22 bird sanctuary in Liberty State Park along the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway adjacent to the Liberty National Golf Course. The owners of the course would like lease the land to expand of it with additional holes. The proposal would require the \\"privatization\\" publicly- owned=land and disruption of the fragile ecosystem. Proposals to protect the land have been made in the New Jersey Legislature to specifically protect the park from commercial development without a severe vetting process and public scrutiny. Transportation The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail runs just west of the park with a station at its entrance. Hornblower Cruises operates ferries to Ellis Island and Liberty Island, and a water taxi to Paulus Hook and the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal. In July 2012, North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority allotted $175,000 to study transportation alternatives to and within the park. In March 2013, Jersey City received a $500,000 grant to study extending Jersey Avenue from Downtown directly into the park, which would simplify access and create a new gateway to the park. In May 2013, a new pedestrian-bike bridge was placed over Mill Creek at the small basin to replace an older one that had been destroyed by Superstorm Sandy in October 2012. It is situated so as not interfere with any new road construction. In 2014 NJDOT announced that it would build a $10 million bridge over the Morris Canal. Construction of the road began in August 2019; the two-lane road bike paths. In popular culture Liberty Harbor The park is featured in the video game Need for Speed: The Run towards the end of the game.

It also has a non-residential campus in Charlotte, North Carolina and an online blended learning program. History As a result of efforts undertaken together by the Synod of Virginia and the Synod of North Carolina, Union Theological Seminary was founded in 1812 as the theological department of Hampden‚ÄìSydney College, located near Farmville, Virginia, and housed in what is now named Venable Hall. In 1895, Lewis Ginter, a financier and philanthropist in Richmond VA, donated eleven acres of land to the school, which was relocated to its current campus location on the north side of Richmond in 1898. The General Assembly's Training School (ATS) for Lay Workers was founded in Richmond in 1914 as a complementary institution intended to train \\"workers outside of the regular ordained ministry.\\" In 1959 ATS was renamed the Presbyterian School of Christian Education (PSCE). PSCE offered a master's degree in Christian Education, and operated across the street from Union Seminary until 1997, when Union and PSCE were joined in federation, becoming Union-PSCE. In 2002, a commuter campus in Charlotte, North Carolina, began on the campus of Queens University of Charlotte, offering both M.Div. and M.A.C.E. degrees to part-time students. The Charlotte campus for Union Presbyterian was relocated to its new facility on 5141 Sharon Road in 2012. In 2009, Union's Board of Trustees voted to change the name of the institution to Union Presbyterian Seminary, partially as a means of distinguishing it from Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. In his address announcing the new name, seminary president Brian Blount emphasized the school's unique heritage of several \\"unions,\\" as well as the school's Presbyterian identity. For many years, the seminary operated WRFK, an FM radio station at 106.5 MHz. WRFK was sold to commercial interests in 1988. Faculty Union has a faculty of scholars in the fields of Bible, Christian education, theology, ethics, preaching, worship, church history, Christian leadership, and pastoral care. Faculty come from a range of denominational backgrounds, including Baptist, Lutheran and Methodist. Notable faculty include president of Union Presbyterian Seminary, Brian Blount. Retired faculty include Bible scholar James L. Mays. Student body Union's student body is made up of about 180 students, with 90 students at the Richmond campus and another 84 students at the Charlotte campus. The majority of Union's students come from the Presbyterian tradition, but the seminary draws students from more than 20 Christian denominations, including Baptist, Methodist, Episcopalian, and Reformed. There are a number of international students as well from Ghana, Korea, Switzerland, and other nations. Students at Union take part in a number of student activities and seminary initiatives, such as mission and service activities to Shalom Farms in the city of Richmond. Campuses William Smith Morton Library Union's Richmond campus includes two chapels: the historic Watts Chapel, located in Watts Hall, which also serves as a classroom and administration building, and the state of the art Lake Chapel, located in the campus's Early Center, a classroom and office building completed in 2008. The Richmond campus also includes the Belk student center, dormitories, student apartments and guest housing, as well as recreation fields, community gardens and tennis courts. Union's William Smith Morton Library was completed in 1996, and includes over 900,000 volumes and grows at a rate of about 5,500 volumes per year. The seminary's Charlotte campus is located on 5141 Sharon Road. This facility opened in 2012 houses a chapel, library, classrooms, a regional Christian Education Resource Center, and office facilities.

It is chronologically the seventh book in the Redwall series. Plot summary Far away, from the northern sea, the Foxwolf Urgan Nagru and his wife Silvamord arrive in Southsward, bringing two shiploads of rats, and storms the Castle Floret. Nagru, the Foxwolf, captures Gael Squirrelking, his wife Serena, their son Truffen and his nursemaid Muta, a mute badger. Entrance to the castle was gained through Silvamord's deceit in feigning weakness and ill fortune in both herself and Urgan Nagru. She then took Truffen the squirrel babe hostage until the gate was opened to the hordes of awaiting rats. Meanwhile, Dandin and Mariel Gullwhacker have set out from Redwall Abbey but have found themselves stuck in the southern dunes without food. After befriending a hedgehog named Bowly Pintips, they find themselves attempting to save a mole who happened to be under attack by Nagru's rat troops. Just as the trio of would-be rescuers realise their peril, Field Marshal Meldrum Fallowthorn the Magnificent bounds to their aid, accompanied by his four leveret nephews. US cover of The Bellmaker Back in Southsward, Gael's otter allies have begun planning a rescue mission. Led by Rab Streambattle, the otters manage to rescue Serena and Truffen, but Gael and Muta encounter trouble. Unable to escape, Muta and Rab stand their ground against waves of Nagru's rat troops, fighting until they collapse under the innumerable odds, presumed dead. Dandin, Mariel and Meldrum survive long enough to fend off Nagru's last effort, two of his psychotic tracking ermine, called Dirgecallers, who were unleashed to track down the escape prisoners. Mariel and her companions manage to kill the trackers, allowing Serena and Truffen to escape to safety, but they are not able to avoid Nagru's rat troops, as they are captured and led back to Castle Floret. Back at Redwall Abbey, Joseph the Bellmaker, the father of Mariel, has a vision. Inspired by Martin the Warrior, the legendary Champion and protector of Redwall, Joseph recruits a hare (The Honourable Rosemary, or Hon Rosie for short), a hedgehog (Durry Quill), a squirrel (Rufe Brush) and the Foremole, the leader of moles. Accompanied by Log-a-Log and a band of Guosim shrews, the band reaches the coast. Intent on finding the place shown to him in his vision, Joseph and his companions befriend Finnbarr Galedeep, a rusky wild sea otter, who helps them deceive searat brothers Slipp and Strapp, stealing the excellent Pearl Queen in the process. Strapp steals the crew of his brother, Slipp and gives chase aboard his ship, the Shalloo, but they are all lost at sea when the ship sinks into a whirlpool called the 'Green Maelstrom'. As Joseph and company sail towards Castle Floret and Urgan Nagru, Slipp and Blaggut, his good-natured first mate, head into Mossflower Woods. When they awaken, Mariel, Dandin and Meldrum find themselves in the dungeons of Castle Floret, along with the battered Gael Squirrelking. With a bit of luck and the help of Glokkpod, a shrike, they manage to escape, but Mariel becomes separated from her friends. As she attempts to find safety, Mariel meets Egbert the Scholar, an old mole living beneath Castle Floret, who happened to find Rab and Muta and nursed them back to health. Psychologically damaged from their near-death battle, the two warriors are intense, but refuse to speak. With their help, Mariel finds her way inside the castle and lowers the drawbridge. At Redwall Abbey, the two rats have arrived and found refuge in the kind, peaceful Abbey. Slipp, after a failed plan to find treasure with a band of Dibbuns, has had enough; he attacks and kills the local Badger Mother, Mellus, and escapes the Abbey with Blaggut and a chalice. After Blaggut learns the truth, he kills his captain and returns to the Abbey with the chalice, seeking forgiveness, which he eventually receives. On the Pearl Queen, many calamities had befallen the Redwallers and their crew, including whirlpools, sharks, shipwrecked islands, and crazy toads. Hon Rosie was taken for dead for some time, but showed up in fine form later. Three young orphans are acquired as well: the squirrel Benjy, the mousemaid Wincey, and the little ottermaid Figgs. They eventually arrive at Southsward and, with the help of some clans they meet on the way, arrive at Castle Floret, ready for battle. A massive battle ensues in which Mariel, Dandin, Meldrum, the otters, Finnbarr, Joseph, and the rest fight Nagru's horde of grey rats, most of which are slaughtered. However, the shrew Fatch, a good friend of Rufe and Durry, is slain by Silvamord, Urgan Nagru's mate. Rab Streambattle, who had recently reunited with his wife Iris and regained his sanity, kills Silvamord in the moat shortly afterward for although she is a mighty warrior, she is unable to swim. In the final battle, Finnbarr Galedeep engages Urgan Nagru and kills him by smashing the fangs of his wolf skull into the top of his head. However, Finnbarr sadly dies from the wounds inflicted during the fight. With Urgan vanquished and his horde depleted, peace is restored upon Castle Floret and Southsward.

From 1891 onward, he was appointed the founding editor of The Economic Journal. Life Edgeworth was born in Edgeworthstown, County Longford, Ireland. He did not attend school, but was educated by private tutors at the Edgeworthstown estate until he reached the age to enter university. His father, Francis Beaufort Edgeworth, was descended from French Huguenots and \\"was a restless philosophy student at Cambridge on his way to Germany when he decided to elope with a teenage Catalan refugee Rosa Florentina Eroles he met on the steps of the British Museum. One of the outcomes of their marriage was Ysidro Francis Edgeworth (the name order was reversed later)....\\" Richard Lovell Edgeworth was his grandfather, and the writer, Maria Edgeworth, was his aunt. As a student at Trinity College Dublin, and Balliol College, Oxford, Edgeworth studied ancient and modern languages. A voracious autodidact, he studied mathematics and economics only after he had completed university. He qualified as a barrister in London in 1877 but did not practise., p. 85: \\"The year 1877 was a productive year for Edgeworth in earning titles. He acquired the degree of Master of Arts from Oxford and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple. This means that he had successfully completed his studies at the professional level. However, by then he had decided not to pursue a legal career.\\" On the basis of his publications in economics and mathematical statistics in the 1880s, Edgeworth was appointed to a chair in economics at King's College London in 1888, and in 1891, he was appointed Drummond Professor of Political Economy at Oxford University. In 1891, he was also appointed the founding editor of The Economic Journal. He continued as editor or joint-editor until his death 35 years later. Edgeworth was a highly influential figure in the development of neo-classical economics. He was the first to apply certain formal mathematical techniques to individual decision making in economics. He developed utility theory, introducing the indifference curve and the famous Edgeworth box, which is now familiar to undergraduate students of microeconomics. He is also known for the Edgeworth conjecture, which states that the core of an economy shrinks to the set of competitive equilibria as the number of agents in the economy gets larger. In statistics, Edgeworth is most prominently remembered by having his name on the Edgeworth series. His most original and creative book on economics was Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences, published in 1881 at the beginning of his long career in the subject. The book was notoriously difficult to read. He frequently referenced literary sources and interspersed the writing with passages in a number of languages, including Latin, French and Ancient Greek. The mathematics was similarly difficult, and a number of his creative applications of mathematics to economic or moral issues were judged as incomprehensible. However, one of the most influential economists of the time, Alfred Marshall, commented in his review of Mathematical Psychics: :This book shows clear signs of genius, and is a promise of great things to come... His readers may sometimes wish that he had kept his work by him a little longer till he had worked it out a little more fully, and obtained that simplicity which comes only through long labour. But taking it as what it claims to be, 'a tentative study', we can only admire its brilliancy, force, and originality. Edgeworth's close friend, William Stanley Jevons, said of Mathematical Psychics:W.S. Jevons's \\"Review of Mathematical Psychics\\", 1881 at cepa.newschool.edu :Whatever else readers of this book may think about it, they would probably all agree that it is a very remarkable one.... There can be no doubt that in the style of his composition Mr. Edgeworth does not do justice to his matter. His style, if not obscure, is implicit, so that the reader is left to puzzle out every important sentence like an enigma. The Royal Statistical Society awarded him the Guy Medal in Gold in 1907. Edgeworth served as the president of the Royal Statistical Society, 1912‚Äì14. In 1928, Arthur Lyon Bowley published a book entitled and devoted to F. Y. Edgeworth's Contributions to Mathematical Statistics. Contributions to economics Papers relating to political economy, 1925 In Mathematical Psychics (1881), his most famous and original book, he criticised Jevons's theory of barter exchange, showing that under a system of \\"recontracting\\" there will be, in fact, many solutions, an \\"indeterminacy of contract\\". Edgeworth's \\"range of final settlements\\" was later resurrected by Martin Shubik (1959) to be the game-theoretic concept of \\"the core\\". *Edgeworth's conjecture When the number of agents in an economy increases, the degree of indeterminacy is reduced. In the limit case of an infinite number of agents (perfect competition), contract becomes fully determinate and identical to the 'equilibrium' of economists. The only way of resolving this indeterminacy of contract would be to appeal to the utilitarian principle of maximising the sum of the utilities of traders over the range of final settlements. Incidentally, it was in this 1881 book that Edgeworth introduced into economics the generalised utility function, U (x, y, z, ...), and drew the first 'indifference curve'. *International trade He was the first one to use offer curves and community indifference curves to illustrate its main propositions, including the \\"optimal tariff\\". *Taxation paradox Taxation of a good may actually result in a decrease in price. He set the utilitarian foundations for highly progressive taxation, arguing that the optimal distribution of taxes should be such that 'the marginal disutility incurred by each taxpayer should be the same' (Edgeworth, 1897). *Monopoly pricing In 1897, in an article on monopoly pricing, Edgeworth criticised Cournot's exact solution to the duopoly problem with quantity adjustments as well as Bertrand's \\"instantly competitive\\" result in a duopoly model with price adjustment. At the same time, Edgeworth showed how price competition between two firms with capacity constraints and/or rising marginal cost curves resulted in indeterminacy. This gave rise to the Bertrand‚ÄìEdgeworth model of oligopoly. *Marginal productivity theory Edgeworth criticised the marginal productivity theory in several articles (1904, 1911), and tried to refine the neo-classical theory of distribution on a more solid basis. Although his work in questions of war finance during World War I was original, they were a bit too theoretical and did not achieve the practical influence he had hoped. *Edgeworth's limit theorem Edgeworth's limit theorem relates to equilibrium of supply and demand in a free market. See Edgeworth's limit theorem. Though Edgeworth's economic ideas were original and in depth, his contemporaries frequently complained of his manner of expression for lack of clarity. He was prone to verbosity and coining obscure words without providing definition for the reader.. See in particular Section 3, \\"Edgeworth's Style\\", pp. 292‚Äì293.

The first creation in the Peerage of England was in 1616 for Thomas Egerton, 1st Baron Ellesmere (1540‚Äì1617), who had been created 1st Baron Ellesmere in 1603. He died a year later and his barony and viscountcy merged with the earldom of Bridgewater, which was created for his son, John Egerton. The earldom had been meant for Thomas Egerton, but he died before he could receive it.

This excessive worry often interferes with daily functioning, and sufferers are overly concerned about everyday matters such as health issues, money, death, family problems, friendship problems, interpersonal relationship problems, or work difficulties.\\"What Is Generalized Anxiety Disorder?\\", National Institute of Mental Health. Accessed 28 May 2008. Symptoms may include excessive worry, restlessness, trouble sleeping, feeling tired, irritability, sweating, and trembling. These symptoms must be consistent and ongoing, persisting at least six months, for a formal diagnosis of GAD. GAD is also common in individuals with a history of substance abuse and a family history of the disorder. Standardized rating scales such as GAD-7 can be used to assess severity of GAD symptoms. Medications which have been found to be useful include duloxetine, pregabalin, venlafaxine, and escitalopram. In a given year, about two percent of American adults and European adults experience GAD.\\"The Numbers Count\\" , National Institute of Mental Health. Accessed 28 May 2007. Globally about 4% are affected at some point in their life. GAD is seen in women twice as frequently as men. Risk factors Genetics Genes are attributed to about a third of general anxiety disorder's variance. Individuals with a genetic predisposition for GAD are more likely to develop GAD, especially in response to a life stressor. Substance-induced Long-term use of benzodiazepines can worsen underlying anxiety, with evidence that reduction of benzodiazepines can lead to a diminishment of anxiety symptoms. Similarly, long-term effects of alcohol consumption is associated with anxiety disorders, with evidence that prolonged abstinence can result in a disappearance of anxiety symptoms. However, it can take up to two years for anxiety symptoms to return to baseline in about a quarter of people recovering from alcoholism. In one study in 1988‚Äì90, illness in approximately half of patients attending mental health services at British hospital psychiatric clinics, for conditions such as panic disorder or social phobia, was determined to be the result of alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. In these patients, anxiety symptoms, while worsening initially during the withdrawal phase, disappeared with abstinence from benzodiazepines or alcohol. Sometimes anxiety pre-existed alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence, but the dependence was acting to keep the anxiety disorders going and could progressively make them worse. Recovery from benzodiazepines tends to take a lot longer than recovery from alcohol, but people can regain their previous good health. Tobacco smoking has been established as a risk factor for developing anxiety disorders. Neurotransmitter systems, inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondria dysfunction and neurogenesis are affected by exposure to cigarette smoke which are all pathways thought to be associated with GAD. Excessive caffeine use has also been linked to aggravating and maintaining anxiety. This is due to overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. Other Populations with a higher rate of diagnosis of GAD include individuals with low and middle socio-economic status and those who are separated, divorced, unemployed, widowed or have low levels of education. African Americans have higher odds of having GAD and the disorder often manifests itself in different patterns. GAD is also common in the elderly population. Low self-esteem, disrupted family environments and sexual abuse also increase the risk of GAD. Pathophysiology Amygdala (in red) brain structures linked to anxiety disorders Generalized anxiety disorder has been linked to disrupted functional connectivity of the amygdala and its processing of fear and anxiety. Sensory information enters the amygdala through the nuclei of the basolateral complex (consisting of lateral, basal and accessory basal nuclei). The basolateral complex processes the sensory-related fear memories and communicates their threat importance to memory and sensory processing elsewhere in the brain, such as the medial prefrontal cortex and sensory cortices. Another area, the adjacent central nucleus of the amygdala, controls species-specific fear responses in its connections to the brainstem, hypothalamus and cerebellum areas. In those with generalized anxiety disorder, these connections seem less functionally distinct, and there is greater gray matter in the central nucleus. Another difference is that the amygdala areas have decreased connectivity with the insula and cingulate areas that control general stimulus salience, while having greater connectivity with the parietal cortex and prefrontal cortex circuits that underlie executive functions. The latter suggests a compensation strategy for dysfunctional amygdala processing of anxiety. This is consistent with cognitive theories that suggest the use in this disorder of attempts to reduce the involvement of emotions with compensatory cognitive strategies. Diagnosis DSM-5 criteria The diagnostic criteria for GAD as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-5 (2013), published by the American Psychiatric Association, are paraphrased as follows: No major changes to GAD have occurred since publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (2004); minor changes include wording of diagnostic criteria. ICD-10 criteria ICD-10 Generalized anxiety disorder \\"F41.1\\" Note: For children different criteria may be applied (see F93.80). Prevention Increased core temperature can help to relax muscles. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids including oily fish such as salmon and mackerel reduce the inflammatory response and thus increase serotonin availability. Many people have found ease through relaxation exercises, deep breathing practice, and meditation. Additionally, avoidance of caffeine may prevent GAD. Avoiding nicotine also can decrease the risk for the development of anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder. Treatment Once GAD develops, it is possible for it to become chronic, but can be managed or eliminated with proper treatment. Both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medications (such as SSRIs) have been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety. A comparison of overall outcomes of CBT and medication on anxiety did not show statistically significant differences (i.e. they were equally effective in treating anxiety). However, CBT is significantly more effective in reducing depression severity, and its effects are more likely to be maintained in the long term, whereas the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment tends to lessen if medication is discontinued. A combination of both CBT and medication is generally seen as the most desirable approach to treatment. Use of medication to lower extreme anxiety levels can be important in enabling patients to engage effectively in CBT. Lifestyle Lifestyle factors including: stress management, stress reduction, relaxation, exercise, sleep hygiene, and caffeine and alcohol reduction can influence anxiety levels. Physical activity has shown to have a positive impact whereas low physical activity may be a risk factor for anxiety disorders. Therapy Generalized anxiety disorder is based on psychological components that include cognitive avoidance, positive worry beliefs, ineffective problem-solving and emotional processing, interpersonal issues, previous trauma, intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, ineffective coping, emotional hyperarousal, poor understanding of emotions, negative cognitive reactions to emotions, maladaptive emotion management and regulation, experiential avoidance, and behavioral restriction. To combat the previous cognitive and emotional aspects of GAD, psychologists often include some of the following key treatment components in their intervention plan; self-monitoring, relaxation techniques, self-control desensitization, gradual stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, worry outcome monitoring, present-moment focus, expectancy-free living, problem-solving techniques, processing of core fears, socialization, discussion and reframing of worry beliefs, emotional skills training, experiential exposure, psychoeducation, mindfulness and acceptance exercises. There exist behavioral, cognitive, and a combination of both treatments for GAD that focus on some of those key components. Among the cognitive‚Äìbehavioral orientated psychotherapies the two main treatments are cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Intolerance of uncertainty therapy and motivational interviewing are two new treatments for GAD that are used as either stand-alone treatments or additional strategies that may enhance CBT. =Cognitive behavioral therapy= Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) appears to be useful in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. However, there is still room for improvement because only about 50% of those who complete treatments achieve higher functioning or recovery after treatment. Therefore, there's a need for enhancement of current components of CBT. CBT usually helps one-third of the patients substantially, whilst another third does not respond at all to treatment.Barlow, D. H.: (2007) Clinical Handbook of Psychological Disorders, 4th ed. CBT is a psychological method of treatment that involves a therapist working with the person to understand how thoughts and feelings influence behaviour.\\"A Guide to Understanding Cognitive and Behavioural Psychotherapies\\" , British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies. Accessed 29 May 2007. Elements of the therapy include exposure strategies to allow the patient to confront their anxieties gradually and feel more comfortable in anxiety-provoking situations, as well as to practice the skills they have learned. CBT can be used alone or in conjunction with medication. Albert Ellis is one such notable cognitive theorist, and practitioner who coined the term \\"maladaptive assumptions.\\" These maladaptive assumptions, negatively incorporated in a client's thought patterns, may serve to disrupt the ability to engage in healthy interactions. Frequent use of such maladaptive assumption such as, \\"It is awful and catastrophic when things are not the way one would very much like them to be\\" may provoke further anxiety over the course of events. Thus rational-emotive therapy, a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, may be implemented to counter clients' maladaptive assumptions, and educate them about the part excessive worrying plays in resulting cognitive interpretations across a span of social situations. Components of CBT for GAD includes psychoeducation, self-monitoring, stimulus control techniques, relaxation, self-control desensitization, cognitive restructuring, worry exposure, worry behavior modification, and problem-solving. The first step in the treatment of GAD is informing of the patient about the issues and the plan of the solution. The purpose of psychoeducation is to provide some relief, destigmatization of the disorder, motivating, and accomplishing participation by making the patient understand the program of treatment. The purpose of this component is to identify cues that provoke the anxiety. Stimulus control intervention refers to minimizing the stimulus conditions under which worrying occurs. Relaxation techniques lower the patients' stress and thus increase attention to alternatives in feared situations (other than worrying). Deep breathing exercise, progressive muscle relaxation, and applied relaxation fall under the scope of relaxation techniques. Self-control desensitization involves patients being deeply relaxed before vividly imagining themselves in situations that usually make them anxious and worry until internal anxiety cues are triggered. Patients then imagine themselves coping with the situation and decreasing their anxious response. If anxiety diminishes, they then enter a deeper relaxed state and turn off the scene. The purpose of cognitive restructuring is to shift from a worrisome outlook to a more functional and adaptive perception of the world, the future, and the self. It involves Socratic questioning that leads patients to think through their worries and anxieties so they can realize that alternative interpretations and feelings are more accurate. It also involves behavioral experiments that actually test the validity of both the negative and alternative thoughts in real-life situations. In CBT for GAD, patients also engage in worry exposure exercises during which they are asked to imagine themselves exposed to images of the most feared outcomes. Then they engage in response-prevention instruction that prevents them from avoiding the image and motivates alternative outcomes to the feared stimulus. The goals of worry exposure are habituation and reinterpretation of the meaning of the feared stimulus. Worry behavior prevention requires patients to monitor the behaviors that caused them worry and are then asked to prevent themselves from engaging in them. Instead, they are encouraged to use other coping mechanisms learned earlier in the treatment. Finally, problem solving focuses on dealing with current problems through a problem-solving approach: (1) definition of the problem, (2) formulation of goals, (3) creation of alternative solutions, (4) decision- making, and (5) implementing and verifying the solutions. =Acceptance and commitment therapy= Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a behavioral treatment based on acceptance-based models. ACT is designed with the purpose to target three therapeutic goals: (1) reduce the use of avoiding strategies intended to avoid feelings, thoughts, memories, and sensations; (2) decreasing a person's literal response to their thoughts (e.g., understanding that thinking \\"I'm hopeless\\" does not mean that the person's life is truly hopeless), and (3) increasing the person's ability to keep commitments to changing their behaviors. These goals are attained by switching the person's attempt to control events to working towards changing their behavior and focusing on valued directions and goals in their lives as well as committing to behaviors that help the individual accomplish those personal goals. This psychological therapy teaches mindfulness (paying attention on purpose, in the present, and in a nonjudgmental manner) and acceptance (openness and willingness to sustain contact) skills for responding to uncontrollable events and therefore manifesting behaviors that enact personal values. Like many other psychological therapies, ACT works best in combination with pharmacology treatments. =Intolerance of uncertainty therapy= Intolerance of uncertainty therapy (IUT) refers to a consistent negative reaction to uncertain and ambiguous events regardless of their likelihood of occurrence. IUT is used as a stand-alone treatment for GAD patients. Thus, IUT focuses on helping patients in developing the ability to tolerate, cope with and accept uncertainty in their life in order to reduce anxiety. IUT is based on the psychological components of psychoeducation, awareness of worry, problem- solving training, re-evaluation of the usefulness of worry, imagining virtual exposure, recognition of uncertainty, and behavioral exposure. Studies have shown support for the efficacy of this therapy with GAD patients with continued improvements in follow-up periods. =Motivational interviewing= A promising innovative approach to improving recovery rates for the treatment of GAD is to combine CBT with motivational interviewing (MI). Motivational interviewing is a strategy centered on the patient that aims to increase intrinsic motivation and decrease ambivalence about change due to the treatment. MI contains four key elements: (1) express empathy, (2) heighten dissonance between behaviors that are not desired and values that are not consistent with those behaviors, (3) move with resistance rather than direct confrontation, and (4) encourage self-efficacy. It is based on asking open- ended questions and listening carefully and reflectively to patients' answers, eliciting \\"change talk\\", and talking with patients about the pros and cons of change. Some studies have shown the combination of CBT with MI to be more effective than CBT alone. Medications An international review of psychiatrists' management of patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) reported that the preferred first-line pharmacological treatments of GAD were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (80%), followed by serotonin‚Äìnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (43%), and pregabalin (35%). Preferred second-line treatments were SNRIs (41%) and pregabalin (36%). =Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors= Pharmaceutical treatments for GAD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\\"Generalized anxiety disorder\\", Mayo Clinic. Accessed 29 May 2007. These are the preferred first line of treatment. These increase serotonin levels through inhibition of serotonin reuptake receptors. FDA approved SSRIs used for this purpose include escitalopram and paroxetine. However, guidelines suggest using sertraline first due to its cost-effectiveness compared to other SSRIs used for generalized anxiety disorder and a lower risk of withdrawal compared to SNRIs. If sertraline is found to be ineffective, then it is recommended to try another SSRI or SNRI. Common side effects include nausea, sexual dysfunction, headache, diarrhea, constipation, restlessness, increased risk of suicide in young adults and adolescents, among others. Sexual side effects, weight gain, and higher risk of withdrawal are more common in paroxetine than escitalopram and sertraline. In older populations or those taking concomitant medications that increase risk of bleeding, SSRIs may further increase the risk of bleeding. Overdose of an SSRI or concomitant use with another agent that causes increased levels of serotonin can result in serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening. =Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors= First line pharmaceutical treatments for GAD also include serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). These inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline to increase their levels in the CNS. FDA approved SNRIs used for this purpose include duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor). While SNRIs have similar efficacy as SSRIs, many psychiatrists prefer to use SSRIs first in the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The slightly higher preference for SSRIs over SNRIs as a first choice for treatment of anxiety disorders may have been influenced by the observation of poorer tolerability of the SNRIs in comparison to SSRIs in systematic reviews of studies of depressed patients. Duloxetine is also indicated for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and neuropathic pain associated with diabetes mellitus, and may be a good option for people with both conditions. Side effects common to both SNRIs include anxiety, restlessness, nausea, weight loss, insomnia, dizziness, drowsiness, sweating, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction and weakness. In comparison to SSRIs, the SNRIs have a higher prevalence of the side effects of insomnia, dry mouth, nausea and high blood pressure. Both SNRIs have the potential for discontinuation syndrome after abrupt cessation, which can precipitate symptoms including motor disturbances and anxiety and may require tapering. Like other serotonergic agents, SNRIs have the potential to cause serotonin syndrome, a potentially fatal systemic response to serotonergic excess that causes symptoms including agitation, restlessness, confusion, tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, ataxia, myoclonus, muscle rigidity, diaphoresis, diarrhea, headache, shivering, goose bumps, high fever, seizures, arrhythmia and unconsciousness. SNRIs like SSRIs carry a black box warning for suicidal ideation, but it is generally considered that the risk of suicide in untreated depression is far higher than the risk of suicide when depression is properly treated. =Benzodiazepines= Benzodiazepines are most often prescribed to people with generalized anxiety disorder. Research suggests that these medications give some relief, at least in the short term. However, they carry some risks, mainly impairment of both cognitive and motor functioning, and psychological and physical dependence that makes it difficult for patients to stop taking them. It has been noted that people taking benzodiazepines are not as alert on their job or at school. Additionally, these medications may impair driving and they are often associated with falls in the elderly, resulting in hip fractures. These shortcomings make the use of benzodiazepines optimal only for short-term relief of anxiety.Barlow, D. H., & Durand, V. M. (2009). Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach. 5th Edition. Belmont: Wadsworth Cengage Learning. CBT and medication are of comparable efficacy in the short-term but CBT has advantages over medication in the longer term. Benzodiazepines (or \\"benzos\\") are fast-acting hypnotic sedatives that are also used to treat GAD and other anxiety disorders. Benzodiazepines are prescribed for generalized anxiety disorder and show beneficial effects in the short term. Popular benzodiazepines for GAD include alprazolam, lorazepam, and clonazepam. The World Council of Anxiety does not recommend the long-term use of benzodiazepines because they are associated with the development of tolerance, psychomotor impairment, cognitive and memory impairments, physical dependence and a withdrawal syndrome. Side effects include drowsiness, reduced motor coordination and problems with equilibrioception. =Pregabalin and gabapentin= Pregabalin (Lyrica) acts on the voltage-dependent calcium channel to decrease the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, norepinephrine and substance P. Its therapeutic effect appears after 1 week of use and is similar in effectiveness to lorazepam, alprazolam and venlafaxine but pregabalin has demonstrated superiority by producing more consistent therapeutic effects for psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms. Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of tolerance and additionally, unlike benzodiazepines, it does not disrupt sleep architecture and produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment. It also has a low potential for abuse and dependency and may be preferred over the benzodiazepines for these reasons. The anxiolytic effects of pregabalin appear to persist for at least six months continuous use, suggesting tolerance is less of a concern; this gives pregabalin an advantage over certain anxiolytic medications such as benzodiazepines. Gabapentin (Neurontin), a closely related medication to pregabalin with the same mechanism of action, has also demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of GAD, though unlike pregabalin, it has not been approved specifically for this indication. Nonetheless, it is likely to be of similar usefulness in the management of this condition, and by virtue of being off-patent, it has the advantage of being significantly less expensive in comparison. In accordance, gabapentin is frequently prescribed off-label to treat GAD. =Other psychiatric medications= * 5-HT1A receptor partial agonists, such as buspirone. Buspirone is an FDA approved first line agent, to be used if SSRI/SNRIs are contraindicated or fail as a treatment. Like the SSRI/SNRIs buspirone has a 2-4 week delayed onset of action and a maximum benefit seen at 4‚Äì6 weeks. Common side effects include dizziness, nausea, and headache. This is a well-tolerated drug with no sedation or sexual side effects, which are commonly seen with SSRI/SNRIs. However, buspirone is not as effective in patients who have been previously treated with benzodiazepines. * Newer, atypical serotonergic antidepressants, such as vilazodone and agomelatine. * Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as imipramine and clomipramine. * Certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as moclobemide and phenelzine. =Other medications= * Hydroxyzine - Antihistamine, 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. * Propranolol - Sympatholytic, beta blocker. * Clonidine - Sympatholytic, Œ±2-adrenergic receptor agonist. * Guanfacine - Sympatholytic, Œ±2-adrenergic receptor agonist. * Prazosin - Sympatholytic, alpha blocker. Comorbidity Depression In the National Comorbidity Survey (2005), 58 percent of patients diagnosed with major depression were found to have an anxiety disorder; among these patients, the rate of comorbidity with GAD was 17.2 percent, and with panic disorder, 9.9 percent. Patients with a diagnosed anxiety disorder also had high rates of comorbid depression, including 22.4 percent of patients with social phobia, 9.4 percent with agoraphobia, and 2.3 percent with panic disorder. A longitudinal cohort study found 12% of the 972 participants had GAD comorbid with MDD. Accumulating evidence indicates that patients with comorbid depression and anxiety tend to have greater illness severity and a lower treatment response than those with either disorder alone. In addition, social function and quality of life are more greatly impaired. For many, the symptoms of both depression and anxiety are not severe enough (i.e. are subsyndromal) to justify a primary diagnosis of either major depressive disorder (MDD) or an anxiety disorder. However, dysthymia is the most prevalent comorbid diagnosis of GAD clients. Patients can also be categorized as having mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, and they are at significantly increased risk of developing full-blown depression or anxiety. Various explanations for the high comorbidity between GAD and depressive disorders have been suggested, including genetic pleiotropy, meaning that GAD and nonbipolar depression might represent different phenotypic expressions of a common etiology. Substance use disorders Those with GAD have a lifetime comorbidity prevalence of 30% to 35% with alcohol use disorder and 25% to 30% for another substance use disorder.Scott, E. L. (2011, September 6). Anxiety Disorders With Comorbid Substance Abuse. Psychiatric Times. Retrieved July 1, 2013, from http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/anxiety/anxiety- disorders-comorbid-substance-abuse People with both GAD and a substance use disorder also have a higher lifetime prevalence for other comorbidities. A study found that GAD was the primary disorder in slightly more than half of the 18 participants that were comorbid with alcohol use disorder. Other comorbidities GAD often coexists with conditions associated with stress, such as muscle tension and irritable bowel syndrome. Patients with GAD can sometimes present with symptoms such as insomnia or headaches as well as pain and interpersonal problems. Further research suggests that about 20 to 40 percent of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have comorbid anxiety disorders, with GAD being the most prevalent. Comorbidity and treatment Therapy has been shown to have equal efficacy in patents with GAD and patients with GAD and comorbid disorders. Patients with comorbid disorders have more severe symptoms when starting therapy but demonstrated a greater improvement than patients with simple GAD. Pharmacological approaches i.e. the use of antidepressants must be adapted for different comorbidities. For example, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and short acting benzodiazepines (BZDs) are used for depression and anxiety. However, for patients with anxiety and substance abuse, BZDs should be avoided due to their abuse liability. CBT has been found an effective treatment since it improves symptoms of GAD and substance abuse. Compared to the general population, patients with internalizing disorders such as depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have higher mortality rates, but die of the same age-related diseases as the population, such as heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and cancer.  History The American Psychiatric Association introduced GAD as a diagnosis in the DSM-III in 1980, when anxiety neurosis was split into GAD and panic disorder. The definition in the DSM-III required uncontrollable and diffuse anxiety or worry that is excessive and unrealistic and persists for 1 month or longer. High rates in comorbidity of GAD and major depression led many commentators to suggest that GAD would be better conceptualized as an aspect of major depression instead of an independent disorder. Many critics stated that the diagnostic features of this disorder were not well established until the DSM-III-R. Since comorbidity of GAD and other disorders decreased with time, the DSM-III-R changed the time requirement for a GAD diagnosis to 6 months or longer. The DSM-IV changed the definition of excessive worry and the number of associated psychophysiological symptoms required for a diagnosis. Another aspect of the diagnosis the DSM-IV clarified was what constitutes a symptom as occurring \\"often\\". The DSM-IV also required difficulty controlling the worry to be diagnosed with GAD. The DSM-5 emphasized that excessive worrying had to occur more days than not and on a number of different topics. It has been stated that the constant changes in the diagnostic features of the disorder have made assessing epidemiological statistics such as prevalence and incidence difficult, as well as increasing the difficulty for researchers in identifying the biological and psychological underpinnings of the disorder. Consequently, making specialized medications for the disorder is more difficult as well. This has led to the continuation of GAD being medicated heavily with SSRIs.  Epidemiology  4% are affected at some point in their life. GAD is seen in women twice as much as men. It has been suggested that this is primarily because women are more likely than men to live in poverty, be subject to discrimination, and be sexually and physically abused.  USA  GAD is the most common cause of disability in the workplace in the United States. United States: Approximately 3.1 percent of people age 18 and over in a given year (9.5 million).  UK  5.9 percent of adults were affected by GAD in 2019.  Other  *Australia: 3 percent of adults\\"Relating the burden of anxiety and depression to effectiveness of treatment\\", World Health Organization. *Canada: 2.5 percent *Italy: 2.9 percent *Taiwan: 0.4 percent The usual age of onset is variable, from childhood to late adulthood, with the median age of onset being approximately 31 and mean age of onset being 32.7. Most studies find that GAD is associated with an earlier and more gradual onset than the other anxiety disorders.Robins LN, Regier DA, eds. Psychiatric disorders in America: the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study. New York: The Free Press, 1991. The prevalence of GAD in children is approximately 3%; the prevalence in adolescents is reported as high as 10.8%. When GAD appears in children and adolescents, it typically begins around 8 to 9 years of age. See also *Daily Assessment of Symptoms ‚Äì Anxiety References Further reading * Brown, T. A., O'Leary, T.

From 1720 to 1803, the Earls of Bridgewater also held the title of Duke of Bridgewater. The 3rd Duke of Bridgewater is famously known as the \\"Canal Duke\\", for his creation of a series of canals in North West England. History Creation for the Daubeny family (1538) The title Earl of Bridgewater was first created in 1538 for Henry Daubeny, 9th Baron Daubeny. The Daubeney ‚Äì Also known as, Dabney ‚Äì family descended from Elias Daubeny, who in 1295 was summoned by writ to the Model Parliament as Lord Daubeny. The eighth Baron was created Baron Daubeny by letters patent in the Peerage of England in 1486 and was also made a Knight of the Garter the following year. All three titles became extinct on the first Earl of Bridgewater's death in 1548.

Thomas Egerton was knighted in 1594, admitted to the Privy Council in 1596 and in 1603 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Ellesmere, in the County of Shropshire, and in 1616 to Viscount Brackley. In 1598 he had inherited the Tatton estate in Cheshire from his brother-in-law Richard Brereton. He was succeeded by his son, John who represented Callington and Shropshire in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of several counties in Wales and western England and who in 1617 was made Earl of Bridgewater in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, the second Earl. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, Lancashire, Cheshire and Herefordshire. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Earl. He was a Whig politician and served as First Lord of Trade and as First Lord of the Admiralty. His eldest son from his first marriage, John Egerton, died as an infant, while his two elder sons from his second marriage, Charles Egerton, Viscount Brackley, and the Hon. Thomas Egerton, both died in the fire which destroyed Bridgewater House in London. Lord Bridgewater was succeeded by his eldest surviving son from his second marriage, the fourth Earl. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire and also held several positions at court. In 1720 he was created Marquess of Brackley, in the County of Northampton, and Duke of Bridgewater, in the County of Somerset. Both titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. The first Duke outlived his two elder sons and was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son from his second marriage, the second Duke. He died from fever at an early age. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Duke. He is remembered as the father of British inland navigation and commissioned the Bridgewater Canal, said to be the first true canal in Britain and the modern world. Bridgewater never married and on his death in 1803 the marquessate and dukedom became extinct. The last Duke was succeeded in the other titles by his first cousin once removed, the seventh Earl. He was the son of the Right Reverend the Hon. John Egerton, Bishop of Durham, son of the Right Reverend the Hon. Henry Egerton, Bishop of Hereford, youngest son of the third Earl. Lord Bridgewater was a General in the Army and also sat as Tory Member of Parliament for Morpeth and for Brackley. He was childless and on his death in 1823 the titles passed to his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He was known as a patron of science as well as a great eccentric. Lord Bridgewater never married and on his death in 1829 his titles became extinct. In the early 17th century, Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley, had purchased Ashridge House in Hertfordshire, one of the largest country houses in England, from Queen Elizabeth I, who had inherited it from her father who had appropriated it after the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. Ashridge House served the Egerton family as a residence until the 19th century. The Egertons later had a family chapel (the Bridgewater Chapel) with burial vault in Little Gaddesden Church, where many monuments commemorate the Dukes and Earls of Bridgewater and their families.Monuments in the Bridgewater Chapel, accessed 24 July 2015 Among those buried here is the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater.Bridgewater Chapel at Little Gaddesden Church, accessed 24 July 2015 Lady Amelia Egerton, sister of the seventh and eighth Earls, married Sir Abraham Hume, 2nd Baronet. Their daughter Sophia Hume married John Cust, 1st Earl Brownlow. Their grandson John William Spencer Brownlow Egerton-Cust, 2nd Earl Brownlow (1842‚Äì1867), assumed the additional surname of Egerton and inherited the Bridgewater estates after a lengthy lawsuit (see the Baron Brownlow for additional information on the Cust family). Also, Lady Louisa Egerton, daughter of the first Duke of Bridgewater, married Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford. Their son George Leveson-Gower, 2nd Marquess of Stafford, was created Duke of Sutherland in 1833. His second son Lord Francis Leveson-Gower assumed by Royal licence the surname of Egerton in lieu of Leveson-Gower according to the will of the third Duke of Bridgewater. In 1846 the Brackley and Ellesmere titles were revived when he was made Viscount Brackley and Earl of Ellesmere. The Hon. Thomas Egerton, of Tatton Park, Cheshire, youngest son of the second Earl of Bridgewater, was the grandfather of Hester Egerton (d. 1780). She married William Tatton. In 1780 they assumed by Royal licence the surname of Egerton in lieu of Tatton. Their great-grandson William Tatton Egerton was created Baron Egerton in 1859. A scoundrel claiming to be the long-lost but rightful Duke of Bridgewater appears in the 1885 novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, which is set before the American Civil War.

It can also be defined as the roulette formed when a circle rolls around a circle with half its radius so that the smaller circle is inside the larger circle. Thus, they belong to the family of curves called centered trochoids; more specifically, they are epitrochoids. The cardioid is the special case in which the point generating the roulette lies on the rolling circle; the resulting curve has a cusp. Depending on the position of the point generating the curve, it may have inner and outer loops (giving the family its name), it may be heart-shaped, or it may be oval. A lima√ßon is a bicircular rational plane algebraic curve of degree 4. Three lima√ßons: dimpled, with cusp (a cardioid), and looped. Not shown: the convex lima√ßon History The earliest formal research on lima√ßons is generally attributed to √âtienne Pascal, father of Blaise Pascal. However, some insightful investigations regarding them had been undertaken earlier by the German Renaissance artist Albrecht D√ºrer. D√ºrer's Underweysung der Messung (Instruction in Measurement) contains specific geometric methods for producing lima√ßons. The curve was named by Gilles de Roberval when he used it as an example for finding tangent lines. Equations The equation (up to translation and rotation) of a lima√ßon in polar coordinates has the form :r = b + a \\\\cos \\\\theta. This can be converted to Cartesian coordinates by multiplying by r (thus introducing a point at the origin which in some cases is spurious), and substituting r^2 = x^2+y^2 and r \\\\cos \\\\theta = x to obtain :(x^2+y^2-ax)^2=b^2(x^2+y^2). Applying the parametric form of the polar to Cartesian conversion, we also haveWeisstein, Eric W. \\"Lima√ßon.\\" From MathWorld --A Wolfram Web Resource. :x = (b+a\\\\cos \\\\theta)\\\\cos \\\\theta = {a\\\\over 2} + b \\\\cos \\\\theta + {a\\\\over 2} \\\\cos 2 \\\\theta, :y = (b+a\\\\cos \\\\theta)\\\\sin \\\\theta = b \\\\sin \\\\theta + {a\\\\over 2} \\\\sin 2 \\\\theta; while setting :z = x + i y = ( b + a \\\\cos \\\\theta) ( \\\\cos \\\\theta + i \\\\sin \\\\theta ) yields this parameterization as a curve in the complex plane: :z = {a\\\\over 2} + b e^{i\\\\theta} + {a\\\\over 2} e^{2i\\\\theta}. If we were to shift horizontally by -a/2, i.e., :z = b e^{it} + {a\\\\over 2} e^{2it}, we would, by changing the location of the origin, convert to the usual form of the equation of a centered trochoid. Note the change of independent variable at this point to make it clear that we are no longer using the default polar coordinate parameterization \\\\theta = \\\\arg z. Special cases In the special case a = b, the polar equation is : r = b(1 + \\\\cos \\\\theta) = 2b\\\\cos^2 \\\\tfrac{\\\\theta}{2} or :r^{1 \\\\over 2} = (2b)^{1 \\\\over 2} \\\\cos \\\\tfrac{\\\\theta}{2}, making it a member of the sinusoidal spiral family of curves. This curve is the cardioid. In the special case a = 2b, the centered trochoid form of the equation becomes :z = b (e^{it} + e^{2it}) = b e^{3it\\\\over 2} (e^{it\\\\over 2} + e^{-it\\\\over 2}) = 2b e^{3it\\\\over 2} \\\\cos {t\\\\over 2}, or, in polar coordinates, :r = 2b\\\\cos{\\\\theta \\\\over 3} making it a member of the rose family of curves. This curve is a trisectrix, and is sometimes called the lima√ßon trisectrix. Form When b > a, the lima√ßon is a simple closed curve. However, the origin satisfies the Cartesian equation given above, so the graph of this equation has an acnode or isolated point. When b > 2a, the area bounded by the curve is convex, and when a < b < 2a, the curve has an indentation bounded by two inflection points. At b = 2a, the point (-a, 0) is a point of 0 curvature. As b is decreased relative to a, the indentation becomes more pronounced until, at b = a, the curve becomes a cardioid, and the indentation becomes a cusp. For 0 < b < a, the cusp expands to an inner loop, and the curve crosses itself at the origin. As b approaches 0, the loop fills up the outer curve and, in the limit, the lima√ßon becomes a circle traversed twice. Measurement The area enclosed by the lima√ßon r = b + a \\\\cos \\\\theta is (b^2 + {{a^2}\\\\over 2})\\\\pi. When b < a this counts the area enclosed by the inner loop twice. In this case the curve crosses the origin at angles \\\\pi \\\\pm \\\\arccos {b \\\\over a}, the area enclosed by the inner loop is : \\\\left (b^2 + {{a^2}\\\\over 2} \\\\right )\\\\arccos {b \\\\over a} - {3\\\\over 2} b \\\\sqrt{a^2 -b^2}, the area enclosed by the outer loop is : \\\\left(b^2 + {{a^2}\\\\over 2} \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\pi - \\\\arccos {b \\\\over a} \\\\right ) + {3\\\\over 2} b \\\\sqrt{a^2 -b^2}, and the area between the loops is : \\\\left (b^2 + {{a^2}\\\\over 2} \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\pi - 2\\\\arccos {b \\\\over a} \\\\right ) + 3b \\\\sqrt{a^2 -b^2}. Relation to other curves * Let P be a point and C be a circle whose center is not P. Then the envelope of those circles whose center lies on C and that pass through P is a lima√ßon. Lima√ßon ‚Äî pedal curve of a circle * A pedal of a circle is a lima√ßon. In fact, the pedal with respect to the origin of the circle with radius b and center (a, 0) has polar equation r = b + a \\\\cos \\\\theta. * The inverse with respect to the unit circle of r = b + a \\\\cos \\\\theta is ::r = {1 \\\\over {b + a \\\\cos \\\\theta}} :which is the equation of a conic section with eccentricity \\\\tfrac{a}{b} and focus at the origin. Thus a lima√ßon can be defined as the inverse of a conic where the center of inversion is one of the foci. If the conic is a parabola then the inverse will be a cardioid, if the conic is a hyperbola then the corresponding lima√ßon will have an inner loop, and if the conic is an ellipse then the corresponding lima√ßon will have no loop. * The conchoid of a circle with respect to a point on the circle is a lima√ßon. * A particular special case of a Cartesian oval is a lima√ßon.

It is long. It starts down from its source near the village of Winkel, in the Jura mountains, with a resurgence near Ligsdorf, turns around Ferrette on its east side, and then runs northward through Alsace, flowing parallel to the Rhine. Taking apart the Largue, also coming from the Jura mountains near Illfurth, it receives several tributaries from the west bank Vosges mountains after passing through Altkirch: the Doller in Mulhouse, the Thur near Ensisheim, the Lauch in Colmar, the Fecht in Illhaeusern, the Giessen in S√©lestat, the Andlau near Fegersheim, the Ehn near Geispolsheim, the Bruche next to Strasbourg and the Souffel upstream from La Wantzenau before meeting with the Rhine downstream from Gambsheim's lock. As the Ill nears the city of Mulhouse, most of its flow is diverted into a discharge channel leading to the Doller, protecting the historical center of the town from floods. Flowing through the city of Strasbourg, the river forms part of the 17th-century fortifications and passes through a series of locks and channels in the picturesque old town, including the Petite France quarter, where its waters were once used to power mills and tanneries. One of these channels is the Canal du Faux-Rempart that, together with the main channel of the Ill, surrounds the Grande √éle or historic centre of Strasbourg.  Navigation  The Ill is currently navigable from a junction with the Canal de la Marne au Rhin for a distance of just under upstream to a head of navigation at Nachtweid. This stretch of river passes through the centre of Strasbourg, and makes connection with the Canal du Faux-Rempart, the Canal du Rhone au Rhine and the, no longer navigable, Canal de la Bruche. There is a single lock, in the Petite France quarter of central Strasbourg. Navigation through the section of the central part of this section, through Petite France, is restricted to small pleasure craft in the downstream direction only; upstream traffic and commercial traffic must use an indirect route from the Canal de la Marne au Rhin to the Canal du Rhone au Rhine via the Port of Strasbourg. Passenger trip boats use this section in the opposite direction, completing their loop via the Canal du Faux-Rempart that is closed to all other traffic. Other stretches of the Ill, downstream of the Canal de la Marne au Rhin to the confluence with the Rhine, and upstream of Nachtweid, are not navigable by powered craft, although they may be used by canoes and similar craft.

Along with his mentor John Ostrom, Bakker was responsible for initiating the ongoing \\"dinosaur renaissance\\" in paleontological studies, beginning with Bakker's article \\"Dinosaur Renaissance\\" in the April 1975 issue of Scientific American. His specialty is the ecological context and behavior of dinosaurs. Bakker has been a major proponent of the theory that dinosaurs were warm-blooded, smart, fast, and adaptable. He published his first paper on dinosaur endothermy in 1968. His seminal work, The Dinosaur Heresies, was published in 1986. He revealed the first evidence of parental care at nesting sites for Allosaurus. He also observed evidence in support of Eldredge and Gould's theory of punctuated equilibrium in dinosaur populations. Bakker currently serves as the Curator of Paleontology for the Houston Museum of Natural Science. Biography HMNS Bakker was born in Bergen County, New Jersey. He attributes his interest in dinosaurs to his reading an article in the September 7, 1953, issue of Life magazine. He graduated from Ridgewood High School in 1963. At Yale University Bakker studied under John Ostrom, an early proponent of the new view of dinosaurs, and later earned his PhD at Harvard. He began by teaching anatomy at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland and Earth and Space Sciences, where future artist Gregory S. Paul worked and collaborated informally under his guidance. Most of Bakker's field work has been done in Wyoming, especially at Como Bluff, but he has travelled as far as Mongolia and South Africa in search of dinosaur habitats. He also worked as an assistant at the University of Colorado. Theories Mounted Gorgosaurus skeleton with several bone injuries, from the \\"Dinosaur Mummy: CSI\\" exhibit at the HMNS, Bob Bakker on the right In his 1986 work The Dinosaur Heresies, Bakker puts forth the theory that dinosaurs were warm- blooded. His evidence for this includes: * Almost all modern animals that walk upright are warm-blooded, and dinosaurs walked upright. * The hearts of warm- blooded animals can pump much more effectively than the hearts of cold-blooded animals. Therefore, the giant Brachiosaurus must have had the type of heart associated with warm-blooded animals in order to pump blood up to its head. * Dinosaurs such as Deinonychus led a very active life, behavior which is much more compatible with a warm-blooded animal. * Some dinosaurs lived in northern latitudes where it would have been impossible for cold-blooded dinosaurs to maintain their body temperature. * The rapid rate of speciation and evolution found in dinosaurs is typical of warm-blooded animals and atypical of cold- blooded animals. * The hypothesized population ratios of predatory dinosaurs to their prey is a signature trait of warm-blooded predators rather than cold- blooded ones. * Birds are warm-blooded and evolved from dinosaurs; therefore, a change to a warm-blooded metabolism must have taken place at some point. There is far more change between dinosaurs and their ancestors (basal archosaurs) than between non-avian dinosaurs and birds. * A warm-blooded metabolism is an evolutionary advantage for top predators and large herbivores; if dinosaurs had not been warm-blooded there should be fossil evidence of warm-blooded animals evolving to fill these ecological niches. No such evidence exists; in fact, by the end of the Cretaceous, mammals had become much smaller than their mammal-like-reptile ancestors. * Dinosaurs grew rapidly, evidence for which can be found by observing cross-sections of their bones. Warm-blooded animals grow at a similar rate. Bakker is also a proponent of the idea that flowering plants evolved because of their interactions with dinosaurs. Writing Bakker lecturing in 2011 Bakker's fictional novel Raptor Red tells of a year in the life of a female Utahraptor during the lower Cretaceous. In the story, Bakker elaborates on his knowledge of the behavior of dromaeosaurids (\\"raptor\\" dinosaurs) and life at the time of their existence. Religious beliefs As a Pentecostal, Ecumenical Christian minister, Bakker has said there is no real conflict between religion and science, and that evolution of species and geologic history is compatible with religious belief. Bakker views the Bible as an ethical and moral guide, rather than a literal timetable of events in the history of life. He has advised non- believers and creationists to read the views put forward by Saint Augustine, who argued against a literal understanding of the Book of Genesis.. Influence on popular media Bakker was an advisor for the 1992 PBS series, The Dinosaurs!. He was also among the advisors for the film Jurassic Park, with some of the early concept art being informed by Bakker's works.The Making of Jurassic Park by D. Shay & J. Duncan, Boxtree Ltd; 1st Edition. edition (30 Jun 1993), p. 21, 113 Bakker also appeared in the Sega CD version of Jurassic Park. Dr. Bakker was a guest in episode 28 of the Williams Street original Space Ghost Coast to Coast. Bakker and his 1986 book are mentioned in the original Jurassic Park.https://curiosity.com/topics/go-on-a-dinosaur-dig-with- robert-t-bakker-curiosity/ The bearded paleontologist Dr. Robert Burke, who is eaten by a Tyrannosaurus rex in Steven Spielberg's film The Lost World: Jurassic Park, is an affectionate caricature of Bakker. In real life, Bakker has argued for a predatory T. rex, while Bakker's rival paleontologist Jack Horner views it as primarily a scavenger. According to Horner, Spielberg wrote the character of Burke and had him killed by the T. rex as a favor for Horner. After the film came out, Bakker recognized himself in Burke, loved the caricature, and actually sent Horner a message saying, \\"See, I told you T. rex was a hunter!\\" Bibliography * . *.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 25, 2001. In the episode, a music producer selects Bart, Nelson, Milhouse and Ralph to be members of the next hit boy band, who record songs containing subliminal messages about joining the Navy. The episode was written by Tim Long and directed by Steven Dean Moore. The episode's title is a play on the boy band New Kids on the Block and Mad Magazine tendency to use the word \\"blecch\\" in their parodic titles. The episode has received positive reviews from critics and was watched by over 18 million viewers. Plot After watching an Olympic Games documentary on TV, Homer decides to participate in the Springfield marathon to prove to Marge that he is fit. Bart dons a stereotypical Italian disguise and wins the marathon by cheating, but a bird pulls off his fake mustache during the trophy presentation. To escape from the outraged crowd, Bart accepts a ride from a stranger, who introduces himself as music producer L.T. Smash. He offers Bart a chance to join Nelson, Ralph and Milhouse in Party Posse, a boy band he is putting together. Bart accepts the opportunity, and the four boys quickly rise to stardom, secretly using voice-enhancing software developed by NASA to improve their singing abilities. Party Posse releases a single whose accompanying video includes the strange line \\"YVAN EHT NIOJ\\" in its chorus. Puzzled, Lisa analyzes the video and finds a subliminal recruiting message for the United States Navy within it; she also realizes that the chorus is simply \\"JOIN THE NAVY\\" written backwards. Seeing that the single's hidden message is beginning to affect the Springfield populace, Lisa confronts Smash, who reveals himself as a Navy lieutenant and explains that popular music has long been used as a recruiting tool by the military. Homer and Marge dismiss Lisa's claims as stemming from jealousy of Bart's fame. During a Party Posse concert aboard an aircraft carrier, Smash's superior officer informs him that the boy band project is being shut down because the band is due to be satirized in an upcoming issue of Mad, sabotaging their recruiting power. The officer turns off Party Posse's voice enhancers, exposing the boys' lack of singing talent and destroying their popularity. Smash goes insane and commandeers the carrier, taking it out to sea as the terrified audience jumps overboard and swims back to the docks. He sails to New York City and destroys the Mad headquarters, despite the sudden arrival of boy band 'N Sync in an attempt to stop him. The employees survive unharmed and Smash is arrested; Bart and his friends are disappointed at not having a chance to appear in Mad, but take comfort in reading the planned parody of them. The episode ends with praise for the Navy by 'N Sync, who suggest that viewers enlist. JC Chasez is surprised and dismayed to learn that his bandmates have signed him up without his knowledge, and two military police officers drag him away screaming. Production The episode was written by Tim Long and directed by Steven Dean Moore. Mike Scully was angry that they had not pitched enough story ideas, so he pitched this episode, along with \\"Trilogy of Error\\". During the pitch session, he suggested that 'N Sync guest star on one of the pitched episodes. The decision to add a government conspiracy came late, an idea which was pitched by George Meyer. At the table read for the episode, the cast ad-libbed the lyrics and music. 'N Sync instantly said yes to being asked to guest star, although Justin Timberlake had to record his lines separately from the rest of the band due to a family death. During the recording session, the staff brought their kids along to meet the band. Tom Hanks, who was filming Cast Away in the same studio, wanted to meet them and came by. The song that introduces 'N Sync every time they walk in is \\"No Strings Attached\\". Timberlake was reluctant to say \\"Word\\" since he swore it was something he would never say, so as a joke the editing team reused the one take where he said \\"Word\\" after nearly every line. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"New Kids on the Blecch\\" was viewed by 18.1 million viewers with a 9.7 rating/15 share making it the top rated animated show of the week. Annie Alleman of The Herald News named the episode her fourth favorite Simpsons episode. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said \\"When it parodies boy bands, 'Blecch' has its moments. Granted, it's tough to really mock boy bands, as they always bordered on self- parody; the Party Posse tunes sound a lot like the real thing. Still, the show works pretty well until it gets to the Navy side of things. Then it just becomes dopey and lacks the moderate bite of the earlier scenes. The show also becomes unintentionally eerie when it features an attack on New York\\". Judge Mac McEntire said the best moment of the episode was the irate choreographer. Corey Deiterman of the Houston Press listed 'N Sync as one of the top five worst musical guests in Simpsons history. At one point in the episode, a flag is depicted on the side of a technical employed by military fighters in Middle Eastern dress. The flag in the episode resembles the flag adopted by the Syrian opposition in the Syrian Civil War, but is actually the Independence flag. The resemblance was cited by some supporters of the Syrian government and media in the Middle East as evidence that the Syrian rebellion was a foreign plot.Mackey, Robert.

They are found mainly in the west of Nepal, Kumaon, Garhwal, Tehri Garhwal, Simla States, Bussahir, Kullu, Chamba till about the Hazara District. Surveys in 1981 and 2003 in the Dhorpatan area of western Nepal established 70 calling sites, suggesting substantial numbers exist in this area (about 200 birds).Lelliott, A.D.(1981) Cheer Pheasants in west-central Nepal. World Pheasant Assoc. 6:89-95 In another survey in 2010, cheer pheasants were detected in 21 calling sites in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. They are found mainly above 6000 feet altitude and up to 10000 feet in summer. Status and conservation Due to ongoing habitat loss, small population size, and hunting in some areas, the cheer pheasant is evaluated as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. Attempts to reintroduce captive- bred cheer pheasants in Pakistan have been unsuccessful.

They are also commonly called bread tags, bread tabs, bread ties or bread-bag clips. By sealing a bag more securely than tying or folding over its open end, the clip or tie may preserve its contents longer. In some cases, the color of the tag indicates the day on which it was baked, although there is no universal standard for the color code. Simple bread clips An assortment of simple bread clips Most designs of bread clip consist of a single plastic part through which the neck of a plastic bag can be threaded. Because these bread clamps, or bread tabs, are cheap, ubiquitous, and come in a variety of shapes and colors, some people collect them. Most bread clips are composed of plastic #6 polystyrene (PS),https://livegreen.recyclebank.com/because-you-asked-can- bread-clips-be-recycled but KLR Systems also makes cardboard bread clips.https://www.bakersjournal.com/new-products/klr-launches-sustainable-bag- clip-7854 Such clips are also used for bagged milk. In Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, Canada, the most common package is 4 litres‚Äîthree 1.33-litre sealed bags in a larger bag, which is closed with a clip and imprinted with the milk's expected expiration date. Mechanical bread clips A more complex bread clip design involves two articulated plastic parts mounted on a pivot with a spring between them to provide tension.  Further Classification  The Holotypic Occlupanid Research Group, also known as HORG, is a parody website that attempts to classify bread clips as if they were biological organisms, using basic principles of taxonomy and systematics.http://www.horg.com/horg/ History bag of buns displaying a best before date. The bread clip was invented by Floyd G. Paxton and manufactured by the Kwik Lok Corporation, based in Yakima, Washington with manufacturing plants in Yakima and New Haven, Indiana. Kwik Lok Corporation's clips are eponymously called \\"Kwik Lok closures\\". Floyd Paxton was known for repeatedly telling the story about how he came up with the idea of the bread clip. As he told it, he was flying home on an airliner in 1952 and opened a bag of peanuts, whereupon he realized he had no way to reclose it. He rummaged through his wallet and found an expired credit card and hand-carved his first bag clip with a small pen knife. When a fruit packer, Pacific Fruit, wanted to replace rubber bands with a better bag closure for its new plastic bags, Paxton remembered his bag of peanuts. He hand-whittled another clip from a small sheet of Plexiglas. With an order in hand for a million clips, Paxton designed a die-cut machine to produce the clips at high speed. Despite repeated attempts, Paxton never won a United States patent for his clips. He did win numerous patents for the high-speed \\"bag closing apparatus\\" that made the clips, inserted bread into bags and applied the clips for the finished product. The bread clip was developed in the early 1950s for a growing need to close plastic bags on the packaging line very efficiently. Manufacturers, using more and more automation in the manufacture and packaging of food, needed methods to raise production volumes and reduce costs. At the same time a hurried population of consumers wanted a fast and easy way to open and effectively seal food bags. The simple bread clip sufficed. In addition, re- closability became a selling point as smaller families and higher costs slowed consumption, leading to a potential for higher rates of spoilage. Kwik Lok Corporation continues to be the main manufacturer of bread clips with Schutte as their European competitor.

Species of the genus Catasetum occur from Mexico to Argentina, including much of Central America, the West Indies, and South America. The largest number of species is in Brazil.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families  Biology  They have thick, cigar-shaped pseudobulbs which are clustered. The leaves are pleated in the upper part and deciduous. The pseudobulbs become spiny after the leaves have dropped. The inflorescence is borne on the basis. It consists of very fleshy flowers that are unisexual, which is exceptional for orchids. The colorful male and yellowish-green female flowers are typically situated on different plants. Which type of flower a plant produces is determined by the conditions under which it grows. Male and female flowers are markedly different in size and color. At first, taxonomists even thought they were dealing with different species, a puzzle which Charles Darwin resolved when writing Fertilisation of Orchids. There are rare cases in which a single plant in intermediate conditions will produce both male and female flowers. leftThe male flowers have a remarkable technique for the ejection of the pollinia. Sack-Shaped Catasetum (Catasetum saccatum), a tropical South American species, discussed by Darwin, actually launches its viscid pollen sacs with explosive force, when an insect touches a seta. He was ridiculed for reporting this by the naturalist Thomas Huxley.Desmond, Adrian; Moore, James (1991), Darwin, London: Michael Joseph, Penguin Group, page 510. In habitat, these plants predominantly grow as epiphytes in very wet forests. Species of this genus all host wood-devouring mycorrhizal fungi which supplement the plants' nutrition by breaking down decomposing wood. Most of these species have a prolonged saprophytic stage in decomposing wood as seedlings before developing leaves and photosynthesis. Fungi which break down wood require a nitrogen source since wood is primarily composed solely of hemi-cellulose, cellulose, and lignin and lacks nitrogen, and these plants are heavy feeders with high nitrogen requirements typically. Many of these species are known to germinate in ant nests high in the canopy and host ant colonies, which provide the plants with an abundant supply of nitrogen, and they also host ants in cultivation frequently.The Orchids, Natural History and Classification, Robert L. Dressler. Most of these species are considered moderately difficult to maintain in cultivation without a greenhouse or Wardian case and some of them defy cultivation. Most of them cannot tolerate dryness and some of them have very specific temperature requirements. Some of these species are ant plants and attract ant colonies and can become a nuisance in cultivation. Catasetum pileatum male flowers. Catasetum macrocarpum female flowers.

It was the first game to include the name \\"Sid Meier\\" in its title as an effort by MicroProse to attract fans of Meier's earlier games, most of which were combat vehicle simulation video games. The game is a simulation of the life of a pirate, a privateer, or a pirate hunter in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. It was widely ported to other systems Pirates! is set in the Caribbean. The Pirates! playing field includes the Spanish Main (namely the northern coast of South America), Central America and the Yucat√°n Peninsula, the entire Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and all Caribbean islands, plus Bermuda. The player is free to sail to any part of the above- mentioned lands, stopped by an invisible barrier southeast of Trinidad, all the way north to just northeast of Bermuda. The Pirates! Gold remake, with minor improvements and better graphics, was released in 1993. An enhanced remake, also named Sid Meier's Pirates!, was released in 2004. Versions for mobile devices have also been released. Gameplay Pirates! is a single- player, open-world game. The player receives a letter of marque authorizing service as a privateer for the Spanish Empire, the Dutch Republic, the Kingdom of England, or the French colonial empire in the Caribbean. The player's loyalties may change over the course of the game; they may also hold rank with multiple countries and may turn to piracy at any time. Gameplay is open-ended; the player may choose to attack enemy ships or towns, hunt pirates, seek buried treasure, rescue long-lost family members, or even avoid violence altogether and seek to increase their wealth through trade. The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. As the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point they are given a position in their future life, from beggar to King's advisor, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments. The era of play is one of the choices given to a player at game-start. Different eras provide a different challenge, as political and economic power shifts between the four fledgling European empires. Choosing 1560 (the earliest choice) as the starting year places the player in the Caribbean almost devoid of influence but that of Spain, while 1680 (the latest choice) provides a mature Caribbean with many non-Spanish colonies and an overall higher degree of activity in the region. The other choices include 1600, 1620, 1640, and 1660, with the progressive effect of reducing Spanish dominance in favor of the other nations, while increasing seafaring traffic. Ship designs are also era-dependent, with some types of ships appearing more frequently in certain eras and less in others, and certain ship types being used near-exclusively by certain nations. In this Macintosh version, graphics like terrain were painted with special glyphs in a custom font The game tests a wide range of skills: hand-eye coordination during the fencing sections, tactical ability during the land and sea combat phases, and strategic thinking, for everything from choosing a wife to deciding when to divide up the plunder. Moreover, each game is likely to take a different course, as most events in the game are random, including the economic and political systems, and early in the game, these can greatly affect future strategic options. In the course of the game a player may try to tack in a frigate in order to run down a smaller and faster pinnace, but must be fortunate enough to have the weather gage. One of the most innovative features of Pirates! is the introduction of a dynamic playing field. In Pirates! many of the most important factors which affect player decisions are randomized at the beginning of the game and continue to shift during gameplay. This not only creates a new experience each time the game is played, but also requires the player to remain flexible, and be ready to exploit possibilities when they occur. Changes happen whenever time passes and they are unrelated to player actions. In fact, in this game in the series, random events do not have any graphical representation, and the player can do nothing to prevent them. The most important random factor in the game lies in the diplomatic relations between the four nations laying claim to the Caribbean. Relations may differ greatly from game to game, and can shift in an instant, creating and removing opportunities, possibly even for long periods of time. The player generally benefits from periods of war between two or more countries, because any aggression towards a country's ships or cities, which occurs often if not specifically avoided, will gain recognition with its enemies, prompting them to bestow the player with land, titles, and other benefits. During peacetime, the player can only benefit from the capture of pirates on the high seas, which is seen as favorable by all nations, but is a rare occurrence. Cities are also dynamic, with statistics like wealth and population fluctuating constantly. The player can access any city's statistics. Knowing the statistics of a city helps the player plan ahead, especially with regards to trading or any desire to raid or conquer cities. The original versions of Pirates! sported both disk and manual copy protections. Users were asked the time at which various treasure ships were arriving at the port. If the time was wrong, the game would continue, but at a much higher difficulty level that would frustrate most people. Development In early 1986, Meier and fellow MicroProse designer Arnold Hendrick wanted to create a role-playing adventure game, but Meier's business partner Bill Stealey was skeptical of producing non-vehicle simulations. The company planned several game elements that it removed before release, including multiple NPCs per town, more detailed sailing including fleet actions, and a subplot involving religion and nobility. Pirates! success resulted in the similar Sword of the Samurai. With five successful years behind him, Microprose considered star designer Sid Meier a selling point and chose to put his name on the box of his next game, despite a shift away from combat simulators he had become known for. According to Stealey, the idea to add Meier's name came after meeting Robin Williams. \\"We were at dinner at a Software Publishers Association meeting, and Robin Williams was there. And he kept us in stitches for two hours. And he turns to me and says 'Bill, you should put Sid's name on a couple of these boxes, and promote him as the star.'\\"\\"Sid Meier: The Father of Civilization\\". Kotaku. Meier in his interview said that \\"Pirates! was actually inspired by a technological trick\\" when \\"one of our programmers came up with a cool trick where we could create images, pieces of art, by packing them into a font.

Its puzzles appealed more to female gamers than previous products from MicroProse, a company known for military simulations like F-15 Strike Eagle. Although other open-ended games had already been released, the style of player-directed gameplay in Pirates! led it to be the spiritual predecessor of countless others since, both by Sid Meier himself (Civilization, Railroad Tycoon) and many others. Compute!'s Gazette in 1987 praised the detailed gameplay with arcade and strategic aspects, stating that \\"the designers of Pirates! set themselves a variety of ambitious goals and succeeded on every count\\". The magazine concluded that the game \\"is a real treasure\\". The game was reviewed in 1988 in Dragon #132 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Pirates! won many awards at the time of its release, including Computer Gaming World's \\"Action Game of the Year\\" for 1988, and two Origins Awards: \\"Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1987\\" and \\"Best Screen Graphics in a Home Computer Game of 1987\\". Computer Gaming World gave Pirates! five stars out of five in a 1990 survey of historical strategy and war games, and four stars in a 1993 survey of pre 20th-century strategy games, calling it \\"a genre breakthrough, this is a fascinating simulation of the Age of Piracy\\". The Australian Commodore and Amiga Review noted excellent manual, educational and historical aspects.The Australian Commodore and Amiga Review, page 34 Orson Scott Card wrote in Compute! in 1989 that Pirates use of an unusually strict copy protection was understandable because \\"the game is so good that even people who drive 55 mph might consider stealing it\\". He stated that Pirates! seemed misleadingly easy, with players discovering non-obvious nuances to the gameplay. In 1993, Computer Gaming World described Pirates! Gold as adding \\"three disks of graphical gold\\" to \\"a great game engine\\". The magazine stated that the game \\"has much to offer a new player and comes with the highest of recommendations\\", but warned those familiar with the original that \\"it was \\"not a significantly revised game with fresh game play\\". In 1989, Computer Gaming World named Pirates! to its Hall of Fame for games readers rated highly over time, with a score of 9.71 out of 12, and Compute! gave it the Compute! Choice Award for Historical Game. In 1990 Pirates! received the tenth-highest number of votes in a survey of Computer Gaming World readers' \\"All-Time Favorites\\". In 1996, the magazine ranked it as the 18th best video game of all time, noting that the Amiga version was by far the best by then. In 2004, readers of Retro Gamer voted Pirates! the 84th top retro game, with the staff noting that \\"people still play the original version, even though Sid Meier himself produced later versions.\\" In 2005, IGN rated it as the sixth greatest video game of all time.http://top100.ign.com/2005/001-010.html In 2011, Polish web portal Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the fifth most addictive classic game \\"that stole our childhood\\".5\\\\.

Legacy The Pirates! Gold remake was released for Windows 3.1, DOS, Macintosh, and Sega Genesis in 1993. It was also released on CD for the Amiga CD32 in 1994 with enhanced CD audio tracks. Sun sighting was not present in this version, and there were no special items. The game did, however, include several new features, such as extra missions assigned to the player by governors. The PC versions were fully modernized CD-ROM games, with VGA graphics, a MIDI score, mouse support, and a copy protection scheme requiring the player to identify the flag of a pirate ship sighted on the horizon. An enhanced remake of 2004, also entitled Sid Meier's Pirates!, was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, Xbox 360, Mac OS X, Wii and PlayStation Portable. Sid Meier's Pirates! Mobile was developed by Oasys Mobile in 2008. Mobile versions were later released for BlackBerry (2010) and Apple's iPad (2011). On 20 April 2012, a version for the Apple iPhone and iPod touch was released, published by 2K Games. In addition, the game was ported over to the Windows Phone 7 on 9 April 2012. In 2013, Tommo purchased the rights to the game and began digitally publishing it through its Retroism brand.

It is, at , the largest public park in New York City. The park is more than three times the size of Manhattan's Central Park. The park is operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks). Pelham Bay Park contains many geographical features, both natural and man-made. The park includes several peninsulas, including Rodman's Neck, Tallapoosa Point, and the former Hunter and Twin Islands. A lagoon runs through the center of Pelham Bay Park, and Eastchester Bay splits the southwestern corner from the rest of the park. There are also several recreational areas within the park. Orchard Beach runs along Pelham Bay on the park's eastern shore. Two golf courses and various nature trails are located within the park's central section. Other landmarks include the Bartow-Pell Mansion, a city landmark, as well as the Bronx Victory Column & Memorial Grove. Before its creation, the land comprising the current Pelham Bay Park was part of Anne Hutchinson's short-lived dissident colony. Part of New Netherland, it was destroyed in 1643 by a Siwanoy attack in reprisal for the unrelated massacres carried out under Willem Kieft's direction of the Dutch West India Company's New Amsterdam colony. In 1654 an Englishman named Thomas Pell purchased 50,000 acres (200 km¬≤) from the Siwanoy, land which would become known as Pelham Manor after Charles II's 1666 charter. During the American Revolutionary War, the land was a buffer between British-held New York City and rebel-held Westchester, serving as the site of the Battle of Pell's Point, where Massachusetts militia hiding behind stone walls (still visible at one of the park's golf courses) stopped a British advance. The park was created in 1888, under the auspices of the Bronx Parks Department, largely inspired by the vision of John Mullaly, and passed to New York City when the part of the Bronx east of the Bronx River was annexed to the city in 1895. Orchard Beach, one of the city's most popular, was created through the efforts of Robert Moses in the 1930s. History  Pre-colonial times  Before the colonization of what is now New York State in the 17th century, Pelham Bay Park comprised an archipelago of islands separated by salt marshes and peninsular beaches. Geologically, most of the park's land first formed during the end of the last ice age, the Wisconsin glaciation, which occurred 10,000 to 15,000 years before the first colonists arrived. The melting of the glaciers caused the formation of the current marshes. Sea level rise from the melting glaciers caused sedimentation along the shore, creating sand and mud flats. Gradually, saltwater cordgrass started to retain sediment, causing some of the inland marshes to flood only during high tide. The Siwanoy (transliterated as \\"southern people\\") were the first Native American tribe to inhabit the Long Island Sound's northern shoreline east to Connecticut. They lived a mostly hunter-gatherer existence. The Siwanoy used the modern-day park site as a ceremonial and burial site, as evidenced by the wampum belts found in the area, which were used for diplomatic purposes among local Native American tribes. Two glacial erratics in the park, deposited during the end of the last ice age, were used ceremonially by the Siwanoy: the \\"Gray Mare\\" on Hunter Island, and Mishow near the Theodore Kazimiroff Nature Trail.  17th and 18th centuries  Aerial view of the park (pictured in the center left) The Dutch West India Company purchased the land in 1639. They called it Vreedelandt, which roughly translates to \\"land of freedom\\", and alternatively Oostdorp, meaning \\"east village\\". Oostdorp became the area known as Westchester Square, to the southwest of the current park. In 1642, Anne Hutchinson and her family moved from Rhode Island to Split Rock, along the Hutchinson River in what is now Pelham Bay Park. Although the family was English, the land was part of New Netherland under Dutch authority. The exact location of the Hutchinson house is unknown, with one scholar saying that the house was in the modern-day park on the east side of the Hutchinson River, and another saying that the house was on the west side of the river in now Baychester. The Siwanoy destroyed the Hutchinson settlement and killed the family in August 1643, in reprisal for the unrelated massacres carried out under Willem Kieft's direction of the Dutch West India Company's New Amsterdam colony. In 1654 an Englishman named Thomas Pell purchased from the Siwanoy, comprising the land of the current Pelham Bay Park as well as the nearby town of Pelham, New York, and made his estate on of that land. The current park consists of the southernmost portion of Pell's estate, excluding Hart Island and City Island. Pell's land became known as Pelham Manor after Charles II's 1666 charter, and parts of Pell's land claim were in conflict with that of other nearby settlers. Pell died in 1669, willing his property to his nephew John, who sold off City Island in 1685. The land grant was renewed in 1687. The next year, Jacob Leisler bought of the remaining property on behalf of the Huguenots, and with that land, founded the town of New Rochelle for the Huguenots. Upon John Pell's death in 1700, he willed the property to his son Joseph, who in turn transferred ownership to his own son, John. Ownership of the manor then went to the Bartow family, who were maternal descendants of the Pell family. The Pell family burial plot faced the Pelham Bay waterfront on the eastern side of the manor. Map of Pelham Bay Park's future site at the time of the Battle of Pell's Point The land was the site of the Battle of Pell's Point during the American Revolutionary War. After the British forces unsuccessfully attempted to trap the main body of the Continental Army on the island of Manhattan, British Army commander-in-chief General Sir William Howe looked for another location along Long Island Sound to disembark his troops. On October 18, 1776, he landed 4,000 men at Pelham, close to the current park. A brigade of 750 men under the command of the American Colonel John Glover were already inland, and they attacked the British advance units from behind a series of stone walls. After a series of attacks, the British broke off, and the Americans retreated. In 1836, Robert Bartow, a descendant of Thomas Pell, bought of his ancestor's old estate. By 1842, construction was complete on the Bartow-Pell Mansion, the family's manor. Bartow died in 1868, and his family sold the mansion to the city in 1880. The mansion went maintained until 1914, when the city and International Garden Club assumed joint maintenance of the building.  1870s and 1880s: Creation  In the 1870s, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted envisioned a greenbelt across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography than a grid system similar to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 in Manhattan. That grid had given rise to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features within the bounds of the grid. However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan. Around the same time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly pushed for the creation of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881. There were objections to the system, which would apparently be too far from Manhattan, in addition to precluding development on the site. However, newspapers and prominent lobbyists, who supported such a park system, were able to petition the bill into the New York State Senate, and later, the New York State Assembly (the legislature's lower house). In June 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed the New Parks Act into law, authorizing the creation of the park system. Mouth of Hutchinson River, in the park Legal disputes carried on for years. Opponents argued that building a park system would divert funds from more important infrastructure, and that everyone in the city would need to pay taxes to pay for the parks' construction, regardless of whether they lived near the parks. In particular, Pelham Bay Park was located within Westchester County at the time, out of city limits. The city was reluctant to pay to buy the parkland because of the cost and locations. Supporters argued that the parks were for the benefit of all the city's citizens; that the value of properties near the parks would appreciate greatly over time; that the Pelham Bay Park site could easily be converted into a park; and that Pelham Bay Park would soon be annexed to the city. Ultimately, the parks were established, owing to efforts from supporters. After much litigation, the city acquired the land for the park. Although the residents of Pelham had initially supported the park's creation, they came to oppose it when they found that the park's creation would decrease the town's tax revenue. The 1,700 acres of land for the park were part of the town's area at that time, but could not be taxed, nearly halving the town's tax revenues from land area. One Pelham resident's letter to New York City Mayor Abram Hewitt, asking for financial assistance to supplement the town's growing tax rate, was published in The New York Times in February 1887. A month later, a group of Pelham residents petitioned Hewitt to oppose the park plan. The government of New York City also did not want to pay taxes to the town of Pelham if it bought the land for the park, which had been one of the reasons for its initial opposition to acquiring the land. There was a proposal to have New York City pay taxes to Pelham if it acquired the land, which the city's Tax Department called \\"entirely novel, and of course, wrong\\". Despite Pelham residents' opposition to the park, the city acquired the land for Pelham Bay Park in 1887, and it officially became a park in 1888. Pelham Bay Park became a recreation area under the auspices of the Bronx Parks Department, which bought the land for $2,746,688, . The park used land from multiple estates spread out over an excess of . Some of the old estates' mansions were still standing twenty years later. To alleviate the concerns of Westchester property owners who lost land during the park system's acquisition, the New York City Commissioners of Estimate distributed compensation payments. The Commissioners of Estimate paid a combined $9 million (), but some land owners sued for more compensation in 1889. 1890s to 1920s: Early years Rock outcropping in Pelham Bay Park In 1890, Mullaly proposed using the site for the 1893 World's Fair due to its size; however, the fair was eventually awarded to Chicago instead. The Pell family's burial vault was also marked for preservation that year, and in July 1891, the descendants of the Pell family were given permission to maintain and restore the plot. After the park opened, several individuals were allowed to reside in the mansions within the park. In 1892, the New York City Department of Public Parks separately allowed the occupation of the Hunter, Hoyt, and Twin Island houses. The next year, two buildings near Pelham Bridge were auctioned off. Pelham Bay Park's ownership was passed to New York City when the part of the Bronx east of the Bronx River was annexed to the city in 1895. Despite the park being for public use, some of the old estates remained standing, with a few occupied by private families. Due to its distance from the city, NYC Parks decided to keep of Pelham Bay and Van Cortlandt Parks in their natural state, unlike some of the other parks closer to Manhattan, which were being extensively landscaped. None of the houses were rented in 1899, but by 1900, thirty-six houses in the park were being used as private residences, comprising 75% of houses rented within parks in the Bronx. This number dropped to thirty-three the next year. In spring 1902, NYC Parks destroyed two houses in the park and used the remaining wood to build free bathhouses, which were used by about 700 bathers per day during that summer. Around 1903, Hunter Island became a popular summer vacation destination. Due to overcrowding on Hunter Island, NYC Parks opened a campsite two years later at Rodman's Neck on the south tip of the island, with 100 bathhouses. Orchard Beach, at the time a tiny recreational area on the northeast tip of Rodman's Neck, was expanded that year. In 1904, an athletic field was opened within Pelham Bay Park. By 1917, Hunter Island saw half a million seasonal visitors. Orchard Beach also became popular, with an average of 2,000 visitors on summer weekdays and 5,000 visitors on summer weekends in 1912. However, the park's condition started to decline in the 1920s as the surrounding areas were developed. The park facilities were dirty and deteriorating due to overuse, and there was a lot of vandalism. Hunter Island was closed and camping was banned, so some park patrons began camping illegally.  1930s-1960s: Moses renovation projects  The current Orchard Beach recreational area and Split Rock golf course was created through the efforts of New York City park commissioner Robert Moses. Immediately after assuming his position in 1934, Moses ordered engineers to inventory every park in the city to see what needed renovating. He devised plans for a new Orchard Beach recreation area after he saw the popularity of the Hunter Island campsite. On February 11, 1934, Moses announced a plan for the new golf course. Two weeks later, he announced another plan for the upgraded beach, which had been inspired by the design of Jones Beach on Long Island. The beach and existing golf course would be reconstructed through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) under the 1930s New Deal program. Orchard Beach promenade, built in the 1930s Moses canceled 625 leases for the project, and after campers unsuccessfully sued the city, the site was cleared of campers in June. Moses decided to connect Hunter Island and the Twin Islands to Rodman's Neck by filling in most of LeRoy's Bay. The deteriorated Hunter Mansion was demolished with the construction of the beach. The golf courses were reopened in June 1935, sixteen months after construction commenced. John van Kleek designed the brand-new Split Rock golf course as part of the city's program to upgrade or build ten golf courses around the city. A final design for the beach was unveiled in July 1935. The beach project involved filling in approximately of LeRoy's and Pelham Bays with landfill, followed by a total of of sand. Moses thought that waste from the New York City Department of Sanitation would be cheaper than sand. In early 1935, workers began placing the garbage fill around Rodman's Neck, Twin Island, and Hunter Island. After the garbage began washing onto the beach, the rest of the site was filled-in using sand starting in 1936. The beach, designed by Gilmore David Clarke and Aymar Embury II, was dedicated in July 1936 despite only being partially complete. The beach officially opened on June 25, 1937. Soon after Orchard Beach opened, it was expanded, starting with the southern locker room in 1939. The water between Hunter and Twin Islands was filled in during 1946 and 1947, with new jetties at each end of the beach. The promenade was extended over the fill and opened in 1947, Further improvements were made to the bathhouse pavilion in 1952 and to the northern jetty in 1955. A new concession stand was added north of the pavilion in 1962, and a privately funded Golf driving range was also added that year. The beach was renovated starting in 1964. In 1959, after the Rodman's Neck section of the park had been used for various purposes, the New York City Police Department used land from the park to create the Rodman's Neck Firing Range at the southern tip of the peninsula. Previously, the parkland at Rodman's Neck had been underused, with the NYPD and United States Army using the land at various times.  1960s-present: Cleanup and restoration  Aerial view of Orchard Beach The City began landfill operations on Tallapoosa Point in Pelham Bay Park in 1963. Plans to expand the landfills in Pelham Bay Park in 1966, which would have created the City's second-largest refuse disposal site next to Fresh Kills in Staten Island, were met with widespread community opposition. The landfill expansion was seen as a way to alleviate the city's accumulations of waste, and Tallapoosa was seen as the only suitable location to put the landfill. The preservation effort was headed by Dr. Theodore Kazimiroff, a Bronx historian and head of the Bronx Historical Society. It suffered setbacks in August 1967 when the New York City Board of Estimate voted against an initial effort to create to protected area in the proposed landfill expansion site. However, the state and federal governments did not favor the landfill being located at Tallapoosa. On October 11, 1967, Mayor John Lindsay signed a law authorizing in the creation of two wildlife refuges, the Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary, on the site where the landfill was planned to be expanded. Tallapoosa West continued to be used as a landfill until May 1968, when the landfill permit was revoked. In November of that year, Tallapoosa West was made a part of the Pell refuge. The dump was still operating as late as 1975, when the garbage there was described as being ten stories high. The landfill closed in 1978. However, a report published in 1983 claimed that the Tallapoosa landfill, as well as five others throughout the city, was heavily contaminated with \\"toxic wastes\\" dumped from 1964 to 1979. The waste from the landfill reportedly led to health problems for residents of nearby communities such as Country Club. The Tallapoosa landfill at Pelham Bay Park was designated a hazardous-waste site in 1988, and cleanup began in 1989. In 1983, the Theodore Kazimiroff Environmental Center was proposed for the park, alongside a nature trail that would wind through the park's terrain. It would be named out of respect to the late historian, who had died in 1980. The Kazimiroff Nature Trail and the Pelham Bay Park Environmental Center opened in June 1986. A $1 million renovation of the Orchard Beach pavilions () was completed by 1986. By the end of the decade, large numbers of human and animal remains were being dumped in Pelham Bay Park, including 65 human bodies that were dumped in the park from 1986 to 1995. Pelham Bay Park was also very dirty, and discarded trash from several decades prior was still visible. NYPD officers on these cases theorized that the frequency of body dumpings might be attributable to two things: the park's remote location near highways, as well as a belief that the parkland is haunted by the remains of the Siwanoy buried there. In 1990, NYC Parks received a $6.3 million gift for improvements to Pelham Bay Park and twenty other parks around the city. NYC Parks used the money to renovate trails and clean up weeds. A renovation of Orchard Beach started in 1995. A water park for the beach was proposed, but ultimately canceled in 1999. A few years later, as part of the city's ultimately unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, several facilities in Pelham Bay Park were proposed for upgrades. The new facilities would have included a shooting center at Rodman's Neck; a horseback riding track; and a fencing, swimming, and water polo facility in the Orchard Beach pavilion. The bid ultimately was awarded to London instead. In 2010, construction began on extending the jetty at Orchard Beach at a cost of $13 million. Soon after, work started on a $2.9 million project to restore Pelham Bay Park's shoreline, which entailed renovating the seawall, adding a dog run, and creating a new walking trail. In 2012, Native American shell middens were found at Tallapoosa Point, prompting an archaeological investigation. Further digs at the site uncovered more than a hundred artifacts, some of which dated to the third century CE. Work on the restoration project was paused in June 2015 as a result of the finds. The restoration project was restarted in September 2015. Geography At , Pelham Bay Park is the city's largest, being slightly more than three times the size of the Central Park. Pelham Bay Park includes of shoreline as well as land on both sides of the Hutchinson River. Hunter Island, Twin Island, and Two-Trees Island, all formerly true islands in Pelham Bay, are now connected to the mainland by fill, and are part of the park. Several islands in the Long Island Sound (including the Chimney Sweeps Islands), as well as Goose Island in the Hutchinson River, are also part of Pelham Bay Park. The park is divided into several sections, including two main sections roughly divided by Eastchester Bay. In the eastern section of Pelham Bay Park is Orchard Beach and its parking lot. The eastern section also contains the Hunter Island Wildlife Sanctuary on Twin and Hunter Islands. The Kazimiroff Nature Trail winds through this section. The northwestern section, divided from the eastern section via the Lagoon. It contains both golf courses, as well as the Thomas Pell Sanctuary; the Bartow-Pell Woods; Goose Creek Marsh; and the Siwanoy, Bridle, and Split Rock Trails. The park is crossed by Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad at this location, as well as by the Hutchinson River Parkway and New England Thruway. A central section contains a Central Woodland, where the Siwanoy Trail and Turtle Cove Driving Range is present. It also includes Rodman's Neck as well as a portion of the park known as \\"The Meadow\\". The Pelham Bridge carries traffic across the Eastchester Bay between the southwest section and the rest of the park. The park contains many different habitats. The largest habitat is the forests, followed by the salt marshes, the salt flats, the meadows, the mixed scrub, and the fresh water marsh. In total, about 67% of the park is estimated to be in its natural state, while 33% of the park is estimated to be developed. In the latter half of the 20th century, Pelham Bay Park's biodiversity decreased: in that time, the park was observed to have lost 25% of its 569 native species of plants as well as 12.5% of its 321 non-native species. Land features =Hunter Island= Hunter mansion Hunter Island () is a peninsula filled with woodlands; it had previously been until Robert Moses extended Orchard Beach in the 1930s. A former island, it was part of the Pelham Islands, the historical name for a group of islands in western Long Island Sound that once belonged to Thomas Pell. The Siwanoy referred to the island as \\"Laap-Ha-Wach King\\", or \\"place of stringing beads\\". The island was then renamed after John Hunter, a successful businessman and politician, who purchased the property in 1804 and moved his family to the island in 1813. They built a mansion in the English Georgian style at the highest point on the island (90 feet above sea level). The mansion was destroyed in 1937 during the construction of Orchard Beach. In 1967, the island became part of the Hunter Island Wildlife Sanctuary. =Twin Island= Twin Island, at , is wooded with exposed bedrock with glacial grooves. The East and West Twin Islands (or the \\"Twins\\") were once true islands in Pelham Bay but are now connected to each other and to Orchard Beach and nearby Rodman's Neck by a landfill created in 1937. East Twin Island, a rocky formation with \\"ribbons of color\\" caused by sedimentary erosion, is connected to neighboring Two Trees Island via a thin mudflat land bridge. Two Trees Island itself consists of a rocky plateau upon which one can see Orchard Beach and the environmental center. West Twin Island was at one time connected to neighboring Hunter Island via a man-made stone bridge, which now lies in ruins in one of the city's last remaining salt marshes. The two islands that are now combined as Twin Island have been owned by NYC Parks since the 1888 acquisition of Pelham Bay Park. A tennis court was built on the island in 1899. Twin Island was restored in 1995 as part of the Twin Islands Salt Marsh Restoration Project, which cost $850,000. =Rodman's Neck= Former private mansion on Rodman's Neck Rodman's Neck is a peninsula located in the central section of the park (at ). The southern third of the peninsula is used as a firing range by the New York City Police Department (NYPD); the remaining wooded section is part of Pelham Bay Park. The north side, which is joined to the rest of Pelham Bay Park near Orchard Beach, contains several baseball fields. Two small land berms between Rodman's Neck and City Island consist of the island's only connecting road to the mainland. Rodman's Neck was part of the historic Pell property, and since the city acquired the peninsula in 1888, it has been used for multiple purposes. It was used as a United States Army training location during World War I, and was converted to under-utilized parkland in the 1920s. From 1930 to 1936, the peninsula was incorporated as part of Camp Mulrooney, a summer camp for the NYPD. The Army used Rodman's Neck again in the 1950s during the Cold War. and the NYPD built the current firing range at the peninsula's southern tip in 1959. =Tallapoosa Point= Tallapoosa Point is located in the southwest of Pelham Bay Park, near the Pelham Bridge. It used to be a separate island south of Eastchester Bay, having been private property, but was connected to the mainland during the colonial period. The point then became a popular fishing spot. In 1879, the Tallapoosa Club political group started leasing part of the peninsula from the city during the summer, hosting activities there. The club's presence gave the peninsula its current name, and in turn, the club's name was derived from Tallapoosa, Georgia, where some of its members had fought during the American Civil War. The Tallapoosa Club used a mansion originally built by the Lorillard family. They used the mansion until October 1, 1895. Tallapoosa Point was used as a dump from 1963 until 1968, when landfill operations ceased and it became a part of the Wildlife Refuge. Since then it has been a part of the park, but there was an obscure proposal in the 1970s to make Tallapoosa into a ski slope. Tallapoosa Point was later re-planted and serves as a bird habitat. Waterways =Pelham Bay= Between City Island and Orchard Beach is a sound named Pelham Bay (), but contrary to its name, it is not a bay, but rather a sound since it is open to larger bodies of water at both ends. It connects to Eastchester Bay at the south, and opens onto Long Island Sound and City Island Harbor at the east. Approximately one third of the original bay was filled in to create Orchard Beach from 1934 to 1938. =Eastchester Bay= Eastchester Bay is a body of water that separates City Island and most of the park from the park's southwest portion and the rest of the Bronx. It is crossed by the Pelham Bridge, which connects the two parts of the park. It is technically also a sound, and the northern end connects via a narrow channel to Pelham Bay. The Hutchinson River empties into Eastchester Bay near the northern end. The lower portion of the bay opens onto the East River, Little Neck Bay, and Long Island Sound. =Lagoon= A lagoon within the park was once part of Pelham Bay, separating Hunter and Twin Islands from the mainland, and was called LeRoy's Bay until the mid-20th century. It was popular for rowing regattas, but could not be used for regulation rowing races as it was blocked by the causeway to Hunter Island. By 1902, there were calls to remove the causeway so LeRoy's Bay could be used as a raceway. The New York City Department of Public Parks decided to create a \\"temporary\\" wooden bridge and remove the causeway to allow the bay's tides to flow freely. Most of the lagoon was filled in during the mid-1930s reconstruction of Orchard Beach, and the bay became known as the \\"Orchard Beach Lagoon\\", or the Lagoon for short. The lagoon between Orchard Beach and the Westchester border had been popular for regattas, or boat races, for decades, but it was neglected through the 1940s and 1950s. Rocks, weeds, and unwanted cars were tossed into the lagoon regularly. The lagoon was chosen as the site of the 1964 Summer Olympics rowing trials, at which point it was widened and dredged, becoming a four- lane, rowing track. The track, which cost $630,000, was hosted jointly by the city and the organizers of the 1964 New York World's Fair. New York City hosted several of the 1964 Olympic trials at various locations as part of the World's Fair the same year. Afterward, the now-unnamed lagoon was used by New York-area colleges for boating regattas, since it had been determined to be one of the most suitable locations for boat racing in the United States. Multiple colleges, including Columbia, Manhattan, St. John's, Fordham, Iona, and Yale, utilized the lagoon for collegiate rowing practice. =Turtle Cove= Turtle Cove is a small cove along the north side of City Island Road west of Orchard Beach Road. Around the early 1900s, a land berm was created across Turtle Cove for rails for horsecars. This berm caused the north end of Turtle Cove to become mostly freshwater, which attracted freshwater drinking rare birds in the meadow. A diameter concrete culvert was placed across the berm to allow salt water from Eastchester Bay, but leaves and vegetation blocked this culvert. Starting in June 2009, NYC Parks started a restoration project for the cove, removing the old culvert and digging a canal to flood the north end of the cove with salt water. NYC Parks then placed a foot bridge across the canal. Some of forest were also restored, with 10,000 trees being replaced. The cove also contains a batting cage and a golf center with miniature golf, PGA simulators, and grass tees. Notable natural features =Glover's Rock= Glover's Rock: \\"Near this site on October 12, 1776 Col. John Glover and 600 patriots held off British and Hessian forces under Gen Howe long enough to save Washington's troops from destruction, enabling them to withdraw to Westchester and ultimate victory.\\" Glover's Rock (), a giant granite glacial erratic, has a bronze plaque commemorating the Battle of Pell's Point. However, contrary to popular belief, the rock had nothing to do with the battle. In their respective books, Henry B. Dawson (1886) and William Abbatt (1901) both wrote that Colonel John Glover reputedly stood on the rock and watched the British forces land during the battle. This claim is erroneous, as these distances were computed based on an inaccurate map using estimates recorded by Glover in his \\"Letter from Mile Square\\" on October 24, 1776. The actual location where Glover watched British forces land is closer to the second tee of the current Split Rock Golf Course. The rock is only known as such today because Abbatt includes a labeled photograph of it in his book. =Split Rock= Split Rock (), a large dome-shaped granite boulder measuring approximately from north to south and from east to west, is located at the intersection of the New England Thruway and Hutchinson River Parkway, on a triangular parcel of land formed by these roads and a ramp that leads from the northbound Parkway to the northbound Thruway. The only public access to the rock is by a pedestrian trail that begins on Eastchester Place, outside the park. The Bridle Trail passes close to the rock, but is separated from the rock by the parkway's exit ramp. Another park trail, called the Split Rock Trail, leads from the Bartow Circle to the rock.Split Rock The Split Rock Golf Course was named after the rock. Split Rock also gives its name to Split Rock Road in Pelham Manor, which used to extend into the park itself. The rock appears to be a glacial erratic and derives its name from a large crevice dividing the stone into two half domes. The huge rock broke in half about 10,000 years ago under the stress of glacial movements. Split Rock is also the location near where, in 1643, Anne Hutchinson and members of her family were massacred by Native Americans of the Siwanoy Tribe. Her daughter, Susanna, the only member of the family to survive the massacre, was at the rock during the time of the attack, which took place at the house, a distance away. In 1904, the New York State Legislature approved the placement of a bronze tablet on Split Rock in honor of Anne Hutchinson. The tablet was installed in 1911 by the Colonial Dames of New York. However, it was stolen in 1914. The plaque reads: ANNE HUTCHINSON Banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1638 Because of her Devotion to Religious Liberty This Courageous Woman Sought Freedom from Persecution in New Netherland Near this Rock in 1643 She and her Household were Massacred by Indians This Tablet is placed here by the Colonial Dames of the State of New York ANNO DOMINI MCMXI Virtutes Majorum Filiae Conservant The boulder is of enough historic importance that in the 1950s, Theodore Kazimiroff of the Bronx Historical Society convinced officials to move the planned Interstate 95 (New England Thruway) a few feet north to save Split Rock from being dynamited. =Treaty Oak= Treaty Oak () is located on the Pell estate near the Bartow-Pell Mansion. It was said that under this oak tree, a treaty was signed between Thomas Pell and Siwanoy Chief Wampage, selling Pell all land east of the Bronx River in what was then Westchester.Nadal, E.S. \\"The New Parks Of The City Of New York\\", Scribner's Magazine, April 1, 1892. Accessed September 6, 2008. The Society of the Daughters of the Revolution erected a protective fence and a plaque near the tree, but it was destroyed by lightning in 1906 and toppled in a storm in March 1909.Staff. \\"BRONX BOOM TREE BLOWN DOWN\\", The Washington Post, April 25, 1909. Accessed September 6, 2008. A replacement tree was planted in 1915, and the current tree at the location is an elm.  Wildlife sanctuaries  Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary consist of a total of of marshes and forests within Pelham Bay Park. They were created in 1967 as a result to opposition to a planned landfill on the site of the current sanctuaries. Much of the forests in these sanctuaries are estimated to be at least three centuries old, dating to colonial times. The park also has two nature centers at Orchard Beach and in the southwestern section of the park. =Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary= The Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary, named for Thomas Pell, makes up the westerly part of Pelham Bay Park. Included within its bounds are Goose Creek Marsh and the saltwater wetlands adjoining the Hutchinson River as well as Goose Island, Split Rock, and the oak‚Äìhickory forests in tidal marshes bordering the Split Rock Golf Course. The area is home to a variety of wildlife including raccoon, egrets, hawks, and coyotes. =Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary= Located north of Orchard Beach, the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary encompasses all of Twin Islands, Cat Briar Island, Two Trees Island, and the northeastern shoreline of Hunter Island. It contains many glacial erratics, large boulders that were deposited during the last ice age, as well as the largest continuous oak forest in Pelham Bay Park. The sanctuary supports a unique intertidal marine ecosystem that is rare in New York State. Wildlife-related activities Bird watching is a popular activity in the park The park is a popular spot for bird watching, with up to 264 species having been spotted. Common bird species observed within the park include great horned owl, northern saw-whet owl, barn owl, red-tailed hawk, and warblers on Hunter Island; American woodcock, willow flycatcher, northern harrier, woodpeckers, black-capped chickadee, tufted titmouse, and white-breasted nuthatch in the meadow west of Orchard Beach; and various songbirds and sparrows north of the Pelham Bay Golf Course. Birds in the park's waters include loons, grebes, cormorants, anseriformes, and gulls from the Twin Island coasts; greater yellowlegs, lesser yellowlegs, loons, hooded merganser, Canada goose, mallard, and egrets in Eastchester Bay and Turtle Cove; and osprey and waterbirds in the lagoon. This is a result of Pelham Bay Park's location within one of the major seasonal bird migration corridors. The National Audubon Society has designated the park as one of four \\"Important Bird Areas\\" within the city. Saltwater fishing is also popular within the park, but is prohibited on Orchard Beach when the beach is open during the summer. There are two major areas where fishing is allowed: in the southern part of Pelham Bay Park near Eastchester Bay; and in the northern part near the Lagoon, Turtle Cove, and northern beach jetty. South of Orchard Beach is a meadow that hosts the only known population of the moth species Amphipoea erepta ryensis. Another population used to exist in Rye, Westchester County.  Surroundings  Pelham Bay Park is bounded by the town of Pelham, New York, to the north; City Island and Long Island Sound to the east; Watt Avenue and Bruckner Expressway to the south; and the Hutchinson River Parkway to the west. North of the park is the village of Pelham Manor in Westchester County, and a strip of land that is part of New York City due to a boundary error. Owners of the several dozen houses on the strip have a Pelham Manor zip code and phone numbers and their children attend Pelham public schools, but as Bronx residents pay much lower property taxes than their Westchester County neighbors. To the southeast, the City Island Bridge connects the park to City Island. Landmarks, attractions, and recreational features Orchard Beach Panoramic view of Orchard Beach, facing from the bathhouse pavilion Orchard Beach (), a public beach, is part of Pelham Bay Park and comprises the borough's only beach. The , beach faces the Long Island Sound and is laid out in a crescent shape with a width of during high tide. An icon of the Bronx, Orchard Beach is sometimes called the Bronx Riviera, the Riviera of New York City, Hood Beach, or the Working Class Riviera. It contains a set of twin pavilions, which were both landmarked by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2006.  Bronx Victory Column & Memorial Grove  South side of statue The Bronx Victory Column & Memorial Grove is a limestone column that supports a bronze statue of Winged Victory on Crimi Road in the park. The grove of trees that surround the statue were originally planted on the Grand Concourse in 1921 by the American Legion; they were removed in 1928 when construction began on the IND Concourse Line (). In 1930, the American Legion revealed plans to relocate the grove to Pelham Bay Prk, where there would be a new monument to honor Bronx servicemen. The monument was designed by John J. Sheridan and sculpted by Belle Kinney and Leopold Scholz. On September 24, 1933, the monument and grove was dedicated to the 947 Bronxites who died in World War I. The column is supported by a pedestal. The statue itself is 18 feet tall and , located atop a series of 14 discs. This brings the monument's aggregate height to more than . While officially a memorial to servicemen from the Bronx, it is also a favorite location for wedding photography.  Bartow-Pell Mansion  A 19th-century plantation-style mansion called Bartow-Pell Mansion (located at ) is a colonial remnant done in Greek revival style. The mansion, originally built in 1842, was sold to the city in 1880 and went maintained until 1914, when the city and International Garden Club assumed joint maintenance of the building. Since 1975, it has been a National Historic Landmark.  Pelham Bay and Split Rock Golf Courses  The Pelham Bay Golf Course opened in 1901, followed by the Split Rock Golf Course in 1935. The courses, consisting of eighteen holes each, share an Art Deco clubhouse (located at ). The courses are separated by the Northeast Corridor railroad tracks, with the Split Rock course to the northwest and the Pelham Bay course to the southeast. Plans for a golf course in Pelham Bay Park have existed since soon after the park was founded. In 1899, the New York Athletic Club approached Lawrence Van Etten, an architect renowned for designing golf courses, for a request to construct an 18-hole course within the park. The proposed course would be bounded by Pelham Manor to the north; the Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad (now Northeast Corridor) tracks to the west; and Shore Road to the southeast. The city was building Van Cortlandt Park's golf course at the time, but the Bronx district parks commissioner approved Van Etten's plan. Originally, the club wanted to construct a park on Hunter Island, but Van Etten felt that the island was too small for a full 18-hole course. Once the Van Cortlandt Park course was opened, city officials started focusing on plans for the Pelham course. Clubhouse In April 1900, surveyors began studying part of the park as a possible location for a golf course. Later that month, workers began construction at the northwest course location. It was expected that the course would open in June or July of that year, but that the work would not be fully complete until September. New York City greenskeeper Val Flood later stated that he thought the course would open by August; however, by September 1900, work on the course had hardly started due to a lack of workers. By the end of 1900, NYC Parks reported that seeds had been planted for nine greens, and two bunkers and one hazard had been created. The course opened in 1901, but did not gain popularity until 1903 when overcrowding at the Van Cortlandt course drove players to use the less crowded Pelham Bay course instead. In 1934, a new 18-hole course was announced for the north side of the park, along with a renovation to the Pelham Bay course under the WPA. It was part of the rebuilding of 10 golf courses in the city. The new course brought the total number of holes in the park's courses to 36, with each course being between between the first and last tees. This comprised two 18-hole courses or four 9-hole courses. There was also a new two-story brick Greek Revival clubhouse adjacent to both of the 18-hole courses, with a golf store, Pro Shop, cafeteria, lockers, restrooms, and showers. Construction started on the new course and clubhouse in September 1934. The new Split Rock course, based on a plan from John van Kleek, opened in 1935 along with the rebuilt Pelham Bay course. Bronx Equestrian Center The northern section of Pelham Bay Park is the home of the Bronx Equestrian Center on Shore Road, where visitors can ride horses and ponies through the parks' trails or obtain riding lessons. The Bronx Equestrian Center also provides wagon rides and hosts wedding events.  Southwestern section  The southwestern part of Pelham Bay Park contains several recreational facilities, but unlike the rest of the park, the southwestern section mainly serves the nearby neighborhoods. The southwest park's largest point of interest is the Aileen B. Ryan Recreational Complex, which contains a running track, two baseball fields, and the Playground for All Children, a play area with special features for physically handicapped children. Another playground, the Sweetgum Playground, is located near Bruckner Boulevard. The Pelham Track and Field includes an artificial turf football field as well as long jumping. The southwest park also contains a dog run, four more baseball fields (for a total of six), two bocce courts, several basketball courts, and nine tennis courts. This section of the park also includes the Pelham Bay Nature Center. The neighborhood of Pelham Bay is across the Bruckner Expressway from this section of the park. A long and narrow woodland called Huntington Woods, located on the southern border of this park, is named after the tract's last owners. Archer Milton Huntington, the founder of the Hispanic Society of America, and his wife, sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington, had acquired the property in 1896 after the park had been established. The city added of Huntington's estate to the park in 1925 and annexed the remaining land in 1933. The southwestern park also contains two monuments. American Boy was commissioned in 1923 by French sculptor Louis St. Lannes and carved from one block of Indiana Limestone. A tribute to the athletic body, it once stood outside the Rice Stadium and Recreation Building; the stadium, named and funded by the widow of Isaac Leopold Rice, stood at the site from the 1920s until 1989. The former stadium site is now the Pelham Track and Field. The other is the Bronx Victory Column & Memorial Grove.  Management  A nonprofit organization called Friends of Pelham Bay Park (founded in 1992) manages the park, while NYC Parks owns and operates the land and facilities. Compared to the Central Park Conservancy, Friends of Pelham Bay Park does not receive as much funding. Before 1992, there was no private maintenance of the park; the earliest efforts for such a thing date to 1983, when an administrator was appointed to oversee both Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay Parks.  Transportation   Bridges  The west end of the City Island Bridge (original bridge pictured) is located inside Pelham Bay Park. As part of the city's acquisition of Pelham Bay Park in 1888, NYC Parks claimed responsibility for maintenance over the western end of the City Island Bridge, which was within the park. The City Island Bridge had been built by the 1870s. By 1892, the bridge was in need of maintenance, and a proposal for a replacement bridge was approved in 1895. The replacement bridge started construction in late 1898 and was completed in 1901. The Pelham Bridge, which had opened in 1871 on the site of two previous bridges, was also incorporated into the park. Planning for a new bridge started in 1901, and NYC Parks transferred the responsibility for constructing the new bridge to the Department of Bridges in 1902. A new stone bridge was opened in 1908 to accommodate higher volumes of traffic. The century-old City Island Bridge was subsequently replaced again in the 2010s. Planning for the new bridge started in 2005, though a lack of funding delayed the start of construction to 2012. The new bridge was completed in 2015, and the old one was demolished soon after.  Roads  The park is traversed by the Hutchinson River Parkway on its west side. The New England Thruway (I-95), a partial toll road, also has a short highway section in the park's northwest corner. A partial interchange between the two roads is located within the park. To the south, an exit from the Hutchinson River Parkway provides direct access to the park, Orchard Beach, and City Island. The exit and entrance ramps lead east to the Bartow Circle, where the ramps intersect with Shore Road, which runs roughly southwest-northeast, and with Orchard Beach Road, which leads southeast to the Orchard Beach parking lot. Slightly to the southwest of Bartow Circle is the T intersection of Shore Road and City Island Road, which marks the northwest terminus of the latter road. Shore Road continues across the Pelham Bridge to the southwest corner of the park, then turns west and continues onto Pelham Parkway. Meanwhile, City Island Road continues southeast to City Island Circle, where it intersects with Park Drive, a road that connects to Orchard Beach Road in the north and Rodman's Neck in the south. City Island Road then continues southeast across the City Island Bridge to the eponymous island. NYC Parks assumed responsibility for the park's roads in 1888 and gradually paved and expanded them over the following decades. An expansion of Eastern Boulevard (later Shore Road) began in 1895. In 1897, the city started extending Pelham Parkway through to Eastern Boulevard. By 1902, Eastern Boulevard was referred to as \\"the Shore drive\\" since it ran close to the LeRoy's Bay shore. The same year, NYC Parks built a dirt path, which connected Glover's Rock to Shore Road. Another dirt road to Pelham Bridge was also built, and a pedestrian path from City Island Bridge to Bartow Station was built. The Hutchinson River Parkway in Pelham Bay Park replaced the old Split Rock Road in the park. The original roadway was an undivided, limited-access parkway, designed with gently sloping curves, stone arch bridges, and wooden lightposts. The original section included bridle paths along the right-of-way. There was also a riding academy where the public could rent horses. The parkway is named for Anne Hutchinson and her family, and passes through the part of the park near where the Hutchinsons were killed by the Siwanoy. The modern-day parkway was extended south from Westchester through Pelham Bay Park in December 1937. The second highway through the park, the New England Thruway, opened in its entirety in October 1958, connecting the Bruckner Expressway in the south with the Connecticut Turnpike in the northeast.  Public transport  eponymous station Pelham Bay Park is served by the New York City Subway at its eponymous station on the west side of the Bruckner Expressway, which is served by the . The station is part of the former Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)'s Pelham Line. The line's northern terminus is located at the southeast corner of Pelham Bay Park, and the IRT station there opened in December 1920. An exit from the station leads onto a pedestrian bridge that crosses the expressway and leads directly to the park. MTA Regional Bus Operations' Bx29 route and Bee-Line Bus System's 45 route also stop at the park. The southbound Bx29 makes three stops in the park: on Bruckner Boulevard near the subway station; at the intersection of Shore Road and City Island Road; and at City Island Circle. Meanwhile, Bee-Line's 45 route stops near Bartow-Pell Mansion. The Bx5 bus also serves Orchard Beach during the summertime only, and the Bx12 and Bx12 SBS services serve Orchard Beach during summer weekends.* * Railroads The Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad was chartered in 1866, connecting the Harlem River in the south and Port Chester in the north. The railroad opened in 1873, with some portions passing through the current park. The route, a branch of the New Haven Line operated by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, contained six stations. One of these stations, called alternatively City Island or Bartow, in Pelham (now part of the park). In 1895, the railroad re- acquired some of the land from the park In 1906, ownership of the Shore Road overpass over the Harlem and Port Chester railroad line was transferred to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. A railroad of some sort also connected City Island and Pelham Bay Park from 1887 to 1919. Originally composed of the separate Pelham Park Railroad Company and the City Island Railroad, the narrow-gauge horsecar route was operated by the former of the two companies, which ran service between the Bartow station of the Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad and Brown's Hotel on City Island. The route was complete by 1892. The IRT absorbed the two companies in 1902 and started designing its own monorail in 1908. The monorail's first journey in July 1910 ended with the monorail toppling on its side, and although service resumed in November 1910, the monorail went into receivership in December 1911. The monorail ceased operation on April 3, 1914, and was subsequently sold to the Third Avenue Railway, which abandoned the line on August 9, 1919. The Harlem River and Port Chester tracks were maintained by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. New stations designed by Cass Gilbert were opened in 1908, but the line's stations were all closed by 1937, having suffered from low ridership. During the late 20th century, the old Harlem River and Port Chester tracks went through a series of ownership changes, and in 1976, Amtrak bought the tracks and integrated the route into its Northeast Corridor. The station house for the line's Bartow station still exists, albeit as a deteriorated shell; the station's roof burned down after it was closed. An overgrown path leads from the bridle trail to the former station site. The city renovated the Shore Road railroad overpass in the early 2000s. Citing the 1906 deed that transferred the bridge's maintenance to the company that owned the railroad below it, the city then filed a lawsuit to make Amtrak pay for the renovation. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Amtrak in 2013.  Paths  Bicycle paths go to all parts of the park and west to Bronx Park, east to City Island, and north to Mount Vernon. The bike trails within the park itself are of varying difficulties. Scenic trails The Kazimiroff Nature Trail, a wildlife observation trail, opened in 1986. It traverses of Hunter Island. Much of the island's natural features are found along the trail. It was opened in 1986 and comprises two overlapping lasso- shaped paths, one slightly longer than the other. The Siwanoy Trail consists of a trail system that originates in the Central Woodlands section of the park. Originating at City Island Road, it bears to the northeast before splitting into two spurs, one going east to the Rodman's Neck meadow and the other going north around Bartow Circle. At the circle's eastern side, the trail splits again. One spur goes northeast in a self-closing loop to the Bartow-Pell Mansion, and the other goes northwest to connect to Split Rock Trail before going around the Hutchinson River Parkway's interchange with Orchard Beach Road. Split Rock Trail originates at Bartow Circle and stretches for along the west side of the park. First designated in 1938 along the path of the former Split Rock Road, the path was renovated in summer 1987. The park is also traversed by a bridle path. That path circumscribes both golf courses, with a spur to the Bronx Equestrian Center.

An innovator concerned with the development of iron ships, and an advocate of humane reform in the Royal Navy, he was also active in politics as a Liberal Member of Parliament and was probably the naval officer most widely known to the public in the early Victorian Era. French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars Hautpoult can be seen in the background. He became a midshipman in 1799 aboard the 16-gun sloop , but left her in May 1800 before she was lost with all hands. He next served aboard , flagship of Sir John Borlase Warren.Priscilla Napier states (p. 3) he was made midshipman in 1800 and \\"entered on the books of\\" HMS Martin, but never actually served in her, because she was lost before he could join her; but Edward Elers Napier (p. 6) quotes a contemporary account showing he was made midshipman in 1799 and sailed in Martin from Leith Roads in November of that year. Martin disappeared, presumed lost with all hands, in October 1800, therefore 5 months after Napier left her for Renown. After this, in November 1802, he transferred to the frigate under Captain William Hoste. The following year, he moved to √âgyptienne for a voyage to St Helena escorting a convoy of ships and then in the English Channel and off the coast of France. (In later years, feeling he had been badly treated as a midshipman by her captain, Charles Fleeming, Napier challenged that officer to a duel, though they were eventually reconciled by their seconds.)Edward Elers Napier, Life and Correspondence, Vol. I, p. 12. In 1804‚Äì5 he served briefly on Mediator before moving to off Boulogne. He was promoted lieutenant on 30 November 1805. He was appointed to , and was present in her in the West Indies at the action in which the squadron under Admiral Warren took the French Marengo (80 guns) and Belle Poule (40 guns), on 13 March 1806. After returning home with Warren, he returned to the West Indies in and having been promoted to commander on 30 November 1807, he was appointed acting commander of the brig of 16 guns, formerly the French privateer Austerlitz. In August 1808 he became captain of the brig-sloop (18 guns), and in her fought a hot action off Antigua with the French sloop Diligente (18 guns), in which his thigh was smashed by a cannonball. In April 1809, Napier took part in the capture of the Caribbean island of Martinique, and subsequently distinguished himself in the Troude's pursuit of three escaping French ships of the line, handling the small Recruit so well that the British were able to capture the French flagship Hautpoult. As a result, he was promoted acting post captain and briefly given the command of the captured 74-gun ship-of-the-line. His rank was confirmed on 22 May 1809, but he was put on half-pay, when he came home as temporary captain of the frigate escorting a convoy. While on half-pay he spent some time at the University of Edinburgh. Napier, still on half-pay, then went to Portugal to visit his three cousins, (all colonels serving in Wellington's army, and one of whom was Charles James Napier, the future conqueror of Sindh). He took part in the Battle of Bu√ßaco, during which he saved his cousin Charles's life and was himself wounded. In 1811, he was appointed captain of the frigate (32 guns) and served in the Mediterranean Fleet under Sir Edward Pellew, disrupting enemy shipping. Among his principal exploits was the 1813 capture of the island of Ponza, which was a possible haven for corsairs.From this exploit he took the pseudonym of \\"Charles, Conte di Ponza\\" (Charles, Count of Ponza) when he commanded a Portuguese naval squadron during the Liberal Wars. In 1813 he moved to command the frigate (36 guns), operating mainly off the French and Spanish Mediterranean coast. American War and the 'Hundred Days' After the surrender of Napoleon and his first period of exile in 1814, Napier and his ship were transferred to the coast of North America, where the War of 1812 with the United States was still in progress, now commanded by Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. In the Chesapeake Bay campaign, he took part in the August expedition up the Potomac River to Alexandria (southeast of the American national capital), Arriving several days after the Burning of Washington and the Battle of Bladensburg under Maj. Gen. Robert Ross and Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn, he was second in command to Captain James Alexander Gordon. The British squadron took 10 days to travel upriver, with many strandings and damage from a tornado/thunderstorm (after the Washington fires), but on 28 August 1814 before attempting a bombardment, they captured Fort Washington on the north shoreline which was blown up by the Americans prior to the attack. The town of Alexandria capitulated with a ransom paid and the shipping there was seized. The squadron successfully withdrew downriver with their prizes despite frequent harassing American attacks from the shores downstream. During this withdrawal Napier was wounded in the neck. He next distinguished himself in the following attack on the city of Baltimore by a British army accompanied by 16 warships, 12‚Äì14 September 1814, under Admirals Cochrane, and Cockburn. HMS Euryalus was involved in the bombardment of Fort McHenry, protecting the city on the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River that began early in the morning of the 13th. At. the same time, earlier on the 12th, Gen. Ross had been put ashore to the southeast at North Point with his regiments to attack the town from the east. He was shot in a brief skirmish just before his troops met the City Brigade regiments of the Maryland Militia under Brig. Gen. John Stricker at the Battle of North Point that afternoon. After pausing for the night to tend to the substantial wounded and now under the command of Col. Arthur Brooke, the regiments waited outside the substantial American dug-in fortifications with opposing approx. 20,000 troops and 100 artillery at old Loudenschlager's Hill (today's Hampstead Hill in western Patterson Park) until the naval forces were able to subdue the fort and move upriver to attack the eastern land redoubts. The critical period of the attack developed shortly after midnight when a picked British force in longboats armed with scaling ladders under Napier's command penetrated the Middle or Ferry Branch of the river along the southern opposite shore (today's Brooklyn and Fairfield areas of southern Baltimore City and Anne Arundel County) to the west of the fort with the intention of storming it from the rear flank. Before they could land, however, they were detected and subjected to a withering fire from the still active guns of Fort McHenry and two smaller forts to the west, batteries Covington and Babcock. The British fought back strongly with cannon and rockets. (Watching the battle from a safe distance, Georgetown lawyer and poet, Francis Scott Key who had been attempting to free a Prince George's County doctor, arrested earlier for jailing British army deserters, William Beanes, was inspired to compose the poem, \\"The Defence of Fort McHenry\\", which was later set to music as The Star-Spangled Banner, (the later American national anthem). Eventually American firepower prevailed; Napier was compelled to retire to the warships with substantial casualties, and Cochrane's fleet later withdrew on the morning of the 14th, with the Americans raising a substantially huge 42 by 30 foot flag, with the firing of the traditional morning gun at daylight, after the night's driving rainstorm and bombardments, enabling all to see from the town that the fort had held. Euryalus proceeded to Halifax, Nova Scotia for refitting and then took part in the ongoing blockade of the eastern seaboard of the U.S.A.. Bored by such duties, Napier issued a challenge to the famous American, Baltimore-built frigate , which had been lying in on the Elizabeth River harbor near the U.S. Naval base at Norfolk, Virginia, (since making her only war cruise during the first year of the War) to come out and fight a single-ship duel. The challenge was accepted and due arrangements were made ‚Äòin the most gentlemanly fashion‚Äô,Diplomacy and Duels on the High Seas Littleton Waller Tazewell and the Challenge of HMS Euryalus By Stuart Butler but Euryalus was made part of the squadron that Admiral Cochrane took to Florida and Louisiana in December 1814 in the operations that climaxed in the Battle of New Orleans on 8 January 1815, and before she could return to fulfil her engagement with Constellation news of the peace treaty of Ghent reached the USA. With Napoleon's escape from Elba and brief return to power, (the 'Hundred Days'), Euryalus returned to Britain. Napier's last mission of the Napoleonic wars was to land troops at the mouth of the River Scheldt to guard against the French advance into Belgium. Marriage and family At the end of the war Napier was made a Companion of the Bath (4 June 1815). He married Frances Elizabeth Elers, n√©e Younghusband, generally referred to as Eliza, whom he had known and loved in Edinburgh while still a teenager. In the meantime Eliza had married a Lieutenant Edward Elers and been widowed. She had four children whom Napier adopted as his own. Of these the second son, Charles Elers Napier, became a naval officer. The eldest, Edward Elers Napier, entered the army, rising to the rank of major-general: he also wrote books of travel and reminiscence, as well as the authoritative biography of his stepfather. Frances also gave Napier two children of his own, a son born in Rome and a daughter born by Lake Geneva. The son, Charles, died as a result of an accident aged five. The first years of his leisure Napier spent in Italy, Switzerland (where he briefly took up farming), and in Paris. He had inherited considerable wealth from his mother's side of the family and spent it freely. Steam and iron During these years Napier began a voluminous and indefatigable correspondence with the Admiralty on the urgency for naval reform, which lasted for the rest of his career. He sought to persuade successive civil administrations of the need for innovative ship-design and tactics, the development of steam ships and the use of iron in ship construction, the proper training of officers, and decent living conditions for ordinary seamen. He held that the use of the press gang and of flogging should be abolished, and that seamen should receive proper wages and pensions. In all this he was far ahead of his time. His advocacy had little effect: on the contrary, successive administrators considered him an eccentric nuisance. He had been interested in steam navigation since its beginnings, and began investing his considerable resources in a steam vessel service that would ply along the River Seine. In 1821 he financed and participated in the construction of one of the first iron-hulled vessels ever built, and the first designed to venture into open water. The Aaron Manby was named after the master of the Horseley Ironworks, Tipton, Staffordshire, where she was pre-fabricated to a design formulated by Napier, Manby and Manby's son Charles and then assembled at Rotherhithe on the Thames. After trials in May 1822, the Aaron Manby crossed the English Channel to Le Havre under Napier's command on 10 June 1822, and proceeded up the Seine to Paris, where she caused a great stir and where she was based for the next decade. This has been claimed as the first passage from France to Britain by steam ship, which it was not: but it was the first direct passage from London to Paris by steam ship and the first seagoing voyage by an iron ship anywhere. Napier's company built five similar steamships but in 1827 he went bankrupt, leaving the family in severe financial difficulty. (Sold off, the ships gave 30 years further service.) Portugal Sir Charles Napier (1854). At the beginning of 1829 he was appointed to command the 42-gun frigate . The Admiralty gave him permission to fit her with paddles of his own design, worked by winches on the main deck. He carried out trials that proved that ships could travel independently of the wind. The Admiralty, however, did not adopt this innovation. At the start of Portugal's Liberal Wars in 1832 Napier was at the Azores, which were the only part of Portuguese territory still held for Queen Maria II of Portugal against the usurpation of her uncle, the absolutist Dom Miguel. He so impressed the constitutional leaders, especially the Count de Vila Flor (better known by his later title of Duke of Terceira), that they begged him to take command of their small fleet. Having unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary by-election for Portsmouth in June 1832 after Galatea was paid off, he accepted their proposals in February 1833. Sailing to Portugal with his stepson Charles Elers Napier as aide-de-camp, bringing troop reinforcements and using the incognito of 'Carlos da Ponza', he arrived in Porto, where Queen Maria's father Dom Pedro, ex-Emperor of Brazil, and the Liberal forces were being besieged by Miguel's armies. He assumed command of the Liberal fleet, succeeding its previous British commander George Rose Sartorius. With the fleet Napier then transported the Liberal army to the Algarve to open a second front in the south of the country. On his return voyage he destroyed the much larger Miguelite fleet in the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 5 July 1833. These two strokes enabled the Liberals to capture Lisbon, which the Miguelites abandoned, though Napier's squadron was now ravaged by cholera. On the demand of France Napier was struck off the British navy list. On the other hand, Dom Pedro appointed him Admiral of the Portuguese Navy on 10 July. Napier's victory, with a fleet largely manned by British seamen, was viewed in Britain as a credit to the Royal Navy. The victory and consequent accolades greatly annoyed King William IV, who disliked both Napier and Dom Pedro. Continuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon, September 1833. For these services he was made Commander of the Tower and Sword, and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the Peerage of Portugal. On 12 September 1833 he captured The Lord of the Isles steamer at Sao Martinho and in 1836 defended his prize in the Court of Common Pleas.State Trials (New Series) III, 621. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the Minho region for the constitutional cause. After the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the restored Portuguese parliament. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth parliamentary seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it. Syrian War Though he published his An Account of the War in Portugal as 'Admiral Charles Napier', he was only an Admiral as far as Portugal was concerned. He was restored to his former rank of captain in the British Navy List by an Order in Council on 9 March 1836,Edward Elers Napier, Life and Correspondence, vol. I, p. 312. and in July 1837 unsuccessfully contested the by-election for Greenwich in the Liberal cause. In 1838 received command of the ship of the line HMS Powerful (84 guns). When troubles broke out in Syria and Muhammad Ali, ruler of Egypt, invaded it and destroyed a Turkish army, Napier was ordered to the Mediterranean. On the evening of 29 May 1839 Powerful was anchored in the Cove of Cork, Ireland when urgent orders came from the Admiralty to proceed at once to Malta. He was also informed that the ships-of-the-line Ganges and Implacable had already started from England. Wishing to overtake them, Napier set sail at 2 a.m. on the 30th for Gibraltar. Powerful arrived at Gibraltar on 12 June to hear the other two ships were three days ahead of her, but by superior seamanship Napier overtook them in the Mediterranean and Powerful entered the harbour of La Valletta, Malta on the evening of 24 June, with band playing and under every stitch of canvas, twelve hours ahead of her rivals.Edward Elers Napier (1862) Volume 1 pp. 363‚Äì7, 372. There followed a lull of about a year. In the summer of 1840 the Maronite Christians of Lebanon rose in revolt against the occupying Egyptians and Muhammad Ali in retaliation sent Ibrahim Pasha with 15,000 troops to burn towns and villages along the Lebanese coast. By 1 July 1840 Napier, with a detached squadron and the rank of commodore, was patrolling the coast to protect British interests. Though in August he appeared off Beirut and called upon Suleiman Pasha, Muhammad Ali's governor, to abandon the town and leave Syria, there was little he could do until September, when he was joined by the allied fleet under Admiral Robert Stopford: mainly British, but also including Austrian, Ottoman and Russian warships. Open war broke out on 11 September. Due to the illness of the army commander, Brigadier-General Sir Charles Smith, Napier was instructed to lead the land force, and effected a landing at D'jounie with 1,500 Turks and marines to operate against Ibrahim, who was prevented by the revolt from doing more than trying to hold the coastal cities. Meanwhile, Stopford, claiming his flag of truce had been fired on, bombarded Beirut, killing many civilians. Napier next distinguished himself by leading an attack by land and sea on Sidon, the Egyptian army's southern base, which capitulated on 28 September. The Egyptians abandoned Beirut on 3 October. While preparing to attack them at Boharsef, Napier was ordered to relinquish command of the army to withdraw and hand over the land forces to the now recovered Brigadier-General Smith. To do so would have meant giving up the tactical initiative, and Napier accordingly disobeyed the order and continued with the attack against Ibrahim's army. The ensuing Battle of Boharsef, on 10 October, was a hard-fought victory, one of the very few land battles won by a naval officer. By the end of the month the only coastal position still held by the Egyptians was Acre, which Stopford was instructed to recapture. On 3 November the Mediterranean Fleet, with its Turkish and Austrian allies, moved into position against the western and southern sides of the town. The fire of the ships (48,000 rounds in all) was devastatingly accurate. A shell penetrated the main magazine in the south of the city, which exploded killing 1,100 men. That night Acre was occupied. British losses were only 18 men killed and 41 wounded. During the action, Napier had manoeuvred independently against Stopford's orders and his division, by accident and mutual misunderstandings, left a space in the fleet's deployment, not that this affected the outcome. Some captains wanted Napier to be court-martialled for insubordination, but Stopford did not push the issue. The rapid collapse of Muhammad Ali's power, with the prospect of bloody chaos in Egypt, was not part of the Allies‚Äô plan, so Stopford sent Napier to command the squadron at Alexandria and to observe the situation. Here, acting once again on his own initiative, Napier appeared before the city on 25 November and enforced a blockade. Napier, without reference to his admiral or the British government, personally negotiated a peace with Muhammad Ali. The treaty guaranteed Muhammad Ali and his heirs the sovereignty of Egypt, and pledged to evacuate Ibrahim's beleaguered army back to Alexandria, if Muhammad Ali in turn renounced all claims to Syria, submitted to the Sultan and returned the Ottoman fleet. 'I do not know if I have done right in settling the eastern question', Napier wrote on 26 November to Lord Minto, the First Lord of the Admiralty.Edward Elers Napier (1862), Volume II, p. 111. Stopford repudiated the arrangement immediately when he had heard the news; the Sultan and the British ambassador were furious, and several of the Allied powers declared it void. Nevertheless, the formal treaty later concluded and confirmed on 27 November was essentially a ratification of Napier's original, and his friend Lord Palmerston congratulated Napier. (Muhammad Ali's last heir, King Farouk, ruled Egypt until 23 July 1952, when the Free Officers Movement under Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser staged a military coup that launched the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 and forced him to abdicate.) Parliament and Channel Fleet In acknowledgement of his distinguished services during the campaign Napier was knighted as a KCB on 4 December 1840, and was also included in the vote of thanks by the Houses of Parliament. He was also presented by the Emperors of Russia and Austria and the King of Prussia with the Order of St. George of Russia; the Order of Maria Theresa of Austria; and the Red Eagle of Prussia. In January 1841, Napier carried out a special mission to Alexandria and Cairo to see that the treaty was being adhered to before returning to Britain in March. He was invited to stand as Parliamentary candidate in two constituencies and so at his own request was placed on half pay. He was returned as Liberal Party MP for Marylebone at the 1841 general election. He spoke mainly on naval topics, especially conditions for seamen and increasing the strength of the navy. In November, 1841, he was appointed Naval Aide-de-Camp to Queen Victoria. He subsequently wrote and published War in Syria, his personal account of the campaign. On 4 December 1845 he was invested with the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh. Napier continued to be interested in warship design and was responsible for the design of the paddle-frigate launched in May 1846. In the same year he lost his parliamentary seat but was promoted rear-admiral of the Blue on 9 November. In May 1847 he was appointed to the command of the Channel Fleet, hoisting his flag in HMS St Vincent. By this time he was perhaps the naval personality most famous to the general public: his level of everyday name- recognition is shown by the passing allusion in William Makepeace Thackeray's famous humorous ballad Little Billee (\\"the British fleet a-riding at anchor / with Admiral Napier, K.C.B.\\"). The Channel Fleet was sometimes a sinecure, but this was by no means the case during Napier's period of command. The fleet's area of operations was not just the English Channel but more or less throughout what in the 20th century would be called the Western Approaches. Portugal was in the closing stages of its ‚Äòlittle‚Äô civil war, the Patuleia, and British interests in that country needed protecting. Ireland, in the aftermath of the Potato Famine, was feared to be near insurrection. Moreover, there were considerations of experiment and training with new ships, made necessary by the rapid technological advances such as screw propulsion. During 1848, the fleet was mainly off the coast of Ireland, where the political situation dictated that Napier show the flag and train for the eventuality of transporting and landing soldiers on practically any part of the Irish coast. In December he took the Channel Fleet further than it had ever operated before, when it was sent to Gibraltar and then onto the Moroccan coast, with the purpose of curbing the activities of Riff pirates. He compelled the Sultan of Morocco, Muley Abderrahman, to grant compensation for the injuries he had inflicted on British commerce. Napier returned to Britain in April 1849 and was ordered to strike his flag. His disappointment that his expected three years term had been cut short led to bitter letters to The Times criticising the Admiralty's policy. When he applied for the vacant Mediterranean command, the Government and Admiralty agreed that he could not be trusted and he was rejected, Rear-Admiral Sir James Dundas being appointed instead. This led Napier to write more angry letters to the newspapers and directly to Prime Minister Lord John Russell claiming that he had been defrauded of his just rights. He unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary seat for the Borough of Lambeth. On 28 May 1853 he was promoted to vice-admiral of the Blue. Baltic Campaign Bomarsund during the √Öland War, which was part of the Crimean War. Napier is the large figure in the slouch hat and carrying telescope in centre foreground. On the outbreak of the Russian War, better known as the Crimean War, he received the command of the Baltic Fleet the largest fleet which the Royal Navy had assembled since the Napoleonic Wars, destined to act in the Baltic Sea. This was not without misgivings on the part of the Admiralty, but he was the most senior and experienced officer available. Napier hoisted his flag in February 1854 in the steam ship of the line , his subordinate commanders being the rear-admirals Armar Lowry Corry, second in command, Henry Ducie Chads, third in command, and James Hanway Plumridge, commanding the scouting forces. They were all elderly men, at most a year or so younger than Napier himself. Napier's force, which was augmented in June by a French fleet sent by Napoleon III and commanded by Alexandre Ferdinand Parseval-Deschenes, though impressive on paper, was radically unsuited to operations in the Baltic, chronically short of men and especially of experienced seamen, while he was hampered by contradictory sets of orders from the Admiralty. Nevertheless, he successfully blockaded all the Russian ports, sufficiently overawed the Russian Baltic Fleet that it never stirred from its moorings, and carried out many bombardment operations as far as the northernmost point of the Gulf of Finland. During the campaign the first ever Victoria Cross was won by midshipman Charles Davis Lucas of the gunboat , who threw a Russian explosive shell overboard before it could detonate. During the campaign Rear- Admiral Corry was invalided home because of poor health; he was replaced by Commodore (later Rear-Admiral) Henry Byam Martin. The major success of the campaign was the capture and destruction, in a near-perfect combined operation by French and British soldiers and sailors, of the Russian fortress of Bomarsund on the √Öland Islands, which were temporarily liberated from Russian rule and which Napier offered to Sweden (they were declined). But he refused to attack the great naval bases at Sveaborg (often quoted as the \\"Gibraltar of the north\\") and Kronstadt, which observation had established were probably impregnable without shallow-draught bomb vessels which he did not have; and a great outcry (led by The Times newspaper) was raised against him for his apparent lack of determination. (His inaction was thoroughly justified by the sequel: in 1855 a better-equipped Anglo-French fleet did bombard Sveaborg, but despite an enormous expenditure of ammunition caused the fortress only trifling structural damage.) Napier felt he was continually being second- guessed by the Admiralty, and especially by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir James Graham. In fact the Naval Lords were reacting to adverse press coverage and unwilling to accept the assessment of the commander on the spot, and relations between them deteriorated as his ships maintained the blockade in atrocious weather, quite unable to storm or destroy impregnable Russian fortresses into the bargain. Never one to mince his words or submit to what he felt to be unmerited criticism, Napier's 'disrespectful' tone in his despatches, which the Admiralty complained of,Russian War, 1854, Baltic and Black Sea, Official Correspondence, p. 197: Secretary of the Admiralty to Sir Charles Napier 13 January 1855: \\"... you have repeatedly thought fit to adopt a tone in your correspondence with their Lordships which is not respectful of their authority\\". sealed his professional fate. Nevertheless, though lacking any dramatic action apart from the capture of Bomarsund, Napier had achieved a great deal. In one modern assessment, the campaign \\"had successfully bottled up the Russian Navy for the entire first summer of the war. The tsar had been denied an opportunity to reinforce his Black Sea fleet with additional ships. The 30,000 Russian troops posted in the Gulf had also been prevented from joining the army in the Crimea.\\"A Brief History of the Crimean War by Alexis S. Troubetzkoy (London: Robinson, 2006. ), p. 223. In addition, Napier's constant training had welded the fleet personnel into a much more competent force for the next year's campaign; and not a single ship had been lost. Retirement On Napier's return from the Baltic to Britain in December 1854 he was ordered to haul down his flag and informed his command was terminated, the fleet being given for the campaign of 1855 to Admiral the Hon. Richard Saunders Dundas, the Second Sea Lord. (None of the flag officers of the 1854 campaign was allowed to return to the Baltic in 1855, but Sir Michael Seymour, Napier's Captain of the Fleet, was promoted to rear-admiral and was made second-in-command to Dundas.) The Admiralty attempted to make Napier a scapegoat for the perceived failure of the campaign (which, within the limits of the possible, had been rather successful) and suborned several captains to testify to their lack of confidence in him, his timidity, his age, his lack of understanding of steam tactics, and his heavy drinking. Nevertheless, some of the leading seamen in the fleet, such as Captain (later Admiral) Sir Bartholomew Sulivan, maintained along with him that Napier's strategy had been wise and the faults lay with the Admiralty themselves. After the war the Russians testified that, knowing Napier's reputation, their main hope had been of his making a foolhardy attack on their fleet under the guns of Kronstadt, where they were confident he would have come to grief. Napier was elected MP for Southwark in February 1855, and carried his dispute with the Admiralty to the floor of the House of Commons. He never received another command. He continued to campaign vigorously for improvements in the way common seamen were treated during and after service, and maintained his parliamentary seat, though broken in health, until his death on 6 November 1860. His tomb is in the churchyard of All Saints, Catherington in Hampshire. The ships of the Portuguese Navy went into eight days of mourning for their former commander. Just before his death Napier had hoped to persuade Giuseppe Garibaldi to acquire a fleet for the liberation of Italy, which he would have commanded. Character According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica entry of 1911, \\"Sir Charles Napier was a man of undoubted energy and courage, but of no less eccentricity and vanity. He caused great offence to many of his brother officers by his behaviour to his superior, Admiral Stopford, in the Syrian War, and was embroiled all his life in quarrels with the Admiralty.\\" Napier was a large, untidy man of about 14 stone (about 200lbs/90kg) who walked with a limp and a stoop due to his leg and neck wounds. His common nickname in the Navy was 'Black Charlie' because of his swarthy appearance and dark side- whiskers. He was also known as 'Mad Charlie' because of his eccentric behaviour and enthusiasms, and 'Dirty Charlie' from his habit of wearing the most unsuitable and ill-fitting clothes while insisting that his officers were correctly dressed at all times.

Identified by Lewis Henry Morgan in his 1871 work Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family, the Eskimo system was one of six major kinship systems (Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha, and Sudanese). Joint family The joint family system places no distinction between patrilineal and matrilineal relatives, instead, it focuses on differences in kinship distance (the closer the relative is, the more distinctions are made). The system emphasizes the nuclear family, identifying directly only the mother, father, brother, and sister. All other relatives are grouped together into categories. It uses both classificatory and descriptive terms, differentiating between gender, generation, lineal relatives (relatives in the direct line of descent), and collateral relatives (blood relatives not in the direct line of descent). The Eskimo system is defined by its \\"cognatic\\" or \\"bilateral\\" emphasis - no distinction is made between patrilineal and matrilineal relatives. Parental siblings are distinguished only by their sex (Aunt, Uncle). All children of these individuals are lumped together regardless of sex (Cousins). Unlike the Hawaiian system, Ego's parents are clearly distinguished from their siblings. Graphic of the Eskimo kinship system Occurrence The Eskimo system is relatively common among the world's kinship systems, at about 10% of the world's societies.Nature of Kinship It is now common in most Western societies (such as those of Europe or Americas). In addition, it is found among a small number of food-foraging peoples such as the !Kung tribe of Africa and the Eskimos/Inuit for whom it is named. The system is widely used in non-unilineal societies, where the dominant relatives are the immediate family. In most Western societies, the nuclear family represents an independent social and economic group, which has caused the emphasis on the immediate kinship. The tendency of families in Western societies to live apart also reinforces this. Terminology The term \\"Eskimo\\" is considered pejorative in Canada, and has been replaced there by the term \\"Inuit\\". The former remains in use in Alaska, though less so than in past decades. In Canada, the term \\"Inuit kinship\\" is therefore widely used instead of \\"Eskimo kinship\\".

In the , Stanthorpe had a population of 5,406 people. The area surrounding the town is known as the Granite Belt. Geography Stanthorpe lies on the New England Highway near the New South Wales border from Brisbane via Warwick, north of Tenterfield and 811 m above sea level. Stanthorpe was developed around Quart Pot Creek which meanders from south-east through the centre of town and then out through the south-west, where its confluence with Spring Creek forms the Severn River. Quart Pot Creek forms part of the south-western boundary of the locality, while the Severn River forms part of the south-western boundary. The New England Highway passes through the town from Applethorpe to the north to Severnlea in the south. Originally it passed through the town centre along the main street, Maryland Street. However, it now bypasses to the west of the main developed area of the town. The Stanthorpe-Texas Road connects Stanthorpe to Broadwater to the west and then travels south-west to Texas. The land within the boundaries of Stanthorpe is primarily used for urban purposes: housing, recreational, commercial and industrial with some undeveloped land on the hillier slopes. Although an agricultural centre of the Granite Belt, there is little agriculture within the town's boundaries. Crops grown in the surrounding area include vegetables, apples, grapes and stone fruit. Wine is also produced in the area, and sheep and cattle grazing is also prevalent. The town lies in the valley of Quart Pot Creek and its tributary Funkers Gap Creek () at above sea level. Lees Hill is the south of the town () and rises to . Mount Banca is to the north-west of the town () and rises to , while Mount Marlay is to the north-east of the town () and rises to . History Stanthorpe Post Office, 2015 Coat of arms, Stanthorpe Post Office, 2015 Father Jerome Davadi, promoter of wine growing in the Stanthorpe area Stanthorpe was founded by tin miners. People came from many countries to mine tin from 1872. Prior to 1872 this area boasted some large pastoral runs and a few prospectors in bark huts. At that time, the area was known as 'Quart Pot Creek'. The Private Township of Stannum existed in the area along one side of the present main street. With the discovery of tin and the influx of miners and new businesses, a 'more suitable' name was sought by the town fathers. Thus, Stanthorpe became the name which encompassed all, as this area became for a time, the largest alluvial tin mining and mineral field in Queensland. Stanthorpe literally means 'tintown', as Stannum is Latin for 'tin' and thorpe is Middle English for 'village'. The Queensland Surveyor General, Augustus Charles Gregory, is credited with coining the name in 1872. When the tin prices fell, many miners turned to farming. The subtropical highland climate was very suitable for growing cool climate fruits and vegetables. Grapes were first planted here in the 1860s with encouragement from the local Catholic parish priest Father Jerome Davadi to produce altar wine. His Italian descent made grape growing and wine production a familiar pastime and the notion caught on in the area. There were plenty of Italian settlers and wine was made for home enjoyment. Mount Marlay was named after Edward Marlay, a selector and tin miner. On 3 July 1827 he purchased Allotment 1, Section 1 in the Town of Stanthorpe. St Joseph's Catholic School was established in October 1872 by four Sisters of Mercy: Sisters M Agnes, Emilian, Muredach and Malachy. Stanthorpe State School opened on 9 March 1874. The railway reached Stanthorpe in May 1881. The Post Office with a clock tower and an elaborate coat of arms was constructed in Maryland Street in 1901 in the Arts and Crafts style. Following Federation, the Commonwealth Government took charge of post and telegraphic services. However, they contracted the construction of post offices in Queensland to the Public Works Department of the Queensland Government and the Stanthorpe Post Office is believed to be one of the first ordered by the Commonwealth Government. It was designed by the first Commonwealth Government Architect John Smith Murdoch. The cool dry climate was valued as an aid to health from the early nineteenth century especially for those suffering from tuberculosis or chest conditions. Following the First World War, Stanthorpe was a major resettlement area for soldiers recovering from mustard gas exposure. Many of these Soldier Settlers took up the land leased to them in the areas around Stanthorpe which now bear the names of First World War battlefields. Stanthorpe State High School opened on 23 January 1961. Stanthorpe Adventist Primary School opened on 25 January 1982 and closed on 2002. The College of Wine Tourism was opened in 2007.

Her credits included the sitcoms Growing Pains, Who's the Boss? and 3rd Rock From The Sun, and the film Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. Through about 1996, she was credited in her appearances as \\"Kimberlee Kramer\\".

It forms a major part of the Panama Canal, carrying ships for of their transit across the Isthmus of Panama. The lake was created between 1907 and 1913 by the building of the Gatun Dam across the Chagres River. At the time it was created, Gatun Lake was the largest human-made lake in the world. Gatun Dam was also the largest of its kind.  Description  The lake is situated in the valley of the Chagres River. It was formed, and the river widened and deepened, by the construction of the Gatun Dam about from the river's mouth in the Caribbean Sea in 1907‚Äì1913. The geography of the area was ideal for the creation of a large lake here; the hills bordering the valley of the Chagres open up widely around the area of the lake, but come together to form a gap just over wide at the location of the dam. The damming of the river flooded the originally wooded valley; almost a century later, the stumps of old mahogany trees can still be seen rising from the water, and submerged snags form a hazard for any small vessels that wander off the marked channels. Gatun Lake has an area of at its normal level of 26 m (85 ft) above sea level; it stores 5.2 cubic kilometres (183,000,000,000 ft¬≥) of water, which is about as much as the Chagres River brings down in an average year. With the creation of the lake many hilltops became islands. The biggest and best known of them is Barro Colorado Island, home of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI). The lake has given its name to the Gatun structure, which may be an eroded impact crater.  Role in the canal  The Panama Canal and the location of Gatun Lake Gatun Lake forms a major component of the Panama Canal; the lake, including the flooded arm extending up the Chagres River, makes up of the raised part of the waterway, the other part being the Culebra Cut. The canal follows a clearly marked route around the lake's islands, following the deeper water south from Gatun Locks, and then east. A small \\"shortcut\\" channel, the \\"Banana Cut\\", runs between the islands, providing a slightly shorter route through the lake; this is used by canal launches and yachts to cut a little time off the crossing and to avoid the heavy ship traffic. The lake is also important as a reservoir of water for the operation of the canal locks. Each time a ship transits the canal, of water is passed from the lake into the sea; with over 14,000 vessel transits per year, this represents a very large demand for water. Since rainfall is seasonal in Panama, the lake acts as a water store, allowing the canal to continue operation through the dry season. A major factor in water regulation is the ability of the rainforest in the lake's watershed to absorb rainfall, releasing it gradually into the lake. However, significant deforestation of the watershed has cleared away much of the vegetation and reduced the area's water capacity. This has resulted in falling water levels in the lake during the dry season. Coupled with the massive increase in canal traffic since its opening, and the resultant increase in water usage, this is an ongoing problem for the canal (see Panama Canal: Water issues). Gatun Lake supplementary benefits Created in 1913 by the damming of the Chagres River, Gatun Lake is an essential part of the Panama Canal which forms a water passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, permitting ship transit in both directions. At the time it was formed, Gatun Lake was the largest human-made lake in the world. The impassable rain-forest around Gatun Lake has endured practically unscathed by human interference and is one of the few accessible areas on Earth where various native Central American animal and plant species can be observed undisturbed in their natural habitat. Barro Colorado Island, which was established for scientific study when the lake was formed and is today operated by the Smithsonian Institution, is the largest island on Gatun Lake. Many important scientific and biological discoveries of the tropical animal and plant kingdom originated here. Lake Gatun encompasses a tropical ecological zone (part of the Atlantic Forest Corridor) and ecotourism on Gatun Lake has become an industry for Panamanians. Angling is one of the primary recreational pursuits on Gatun Lake. Non-native peacock bass were introduced deliberately to Gatun Lake around 1967 by a local businessman, and have since flourished to become the dominant angling game fish in Gatun Lake. Locally called Sargento, and believed to be the species Cichla pleiozona, these peacock bass are not a native game fish of Panama but originate from the Amazon, Rio Negro, and Orinoco river basins of South America where they are called Tucanare or Pavon and are considered a premier game fish.

The distillery, which lies on the South Eastern shore of Loch Indaal, is one of the oldest in Scotland and is said to have been established in 1779. The distillery is owned by Morrison Bowmore Distillers Ltd, a holding company owned by Beam Suntory, a subsidiary of Japanese multinational drinks conglomerate Suntory. Morrison Bowmore also own the Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch distilleries and produce the McClelland's Single Malt range of bottlings. History The Bowmore Distillery was established in 1779 by a local merchant, John P. Simson, before passing into the ownership of the Mutter family, a family of German descent. James Mutter, head of the family, also had farming interests and was Vice Consul representing the Ottoman Empire, Portugal, and Brazil through their Glasgow consulates. There are no records that pinpoint the date Mutter acquired the distillery from Simpson. Mutter would introduce a number of innovative processes to the distillery during his tenure and even had a small iron steam ship built to import barley and coal from the mainland and to export the whisky to Glasgow. A bottle of 1850 Bowmore Single Malt was sold at an auction in September 2007 for ¬£29,400. The distillery was bought from the Mutter family in 1925 by J.B. Sheriff & Co. and remained under their ownership until being purchased by Inverness-based William Grigor & Son, Ltd. in 1950. During the World Wars the Bowmore Distillery halted production, and hosted the RAF Coastal Command for much of World War II, Coastal Command operated flying boats from Loch Indaal on anti-submarine warfare missions. Stanley P. Morrison and James Howat formed Stanley P. Morrison Ltd. in 1951, and this company formed Morrison's Bowmore Distillery, Ltd. in 1963 in order to take over the Bowmore Distillery. Stanley P. Morrison died in 1971, and control of the companies passed to Brian Morrison. The company name has changed slightly, and, following minor restructuring, the distillery is now owned by Morrison Bowmore Distillers Ltd., which is ultimately owned by the Japanese distiller Suntory, following their takeover of Morrison Bowmore Distillers Ltd. during 1994. Suntory had previously been a shareholder in Morrison Bowmore for several years. Production Bowmore Distillery sources as much barley as possible from on the island of Islay, but there are insufficient quantities produced to satisfy the distillery's demand, so barley is also imported from the mainland. The distillery retains a traditional floor malting, but this also lacks sufficient capacity; the barley imported from the mainland is normally already malted. The distillery has an annual capacity of two million litres, with fermentation undertaken in traditional wooden washbacks before the liquid is passed through two wash stills and then through two spirit stills. The waste heat from the distillation process goes to heat a nearby public swimming pool that was built in one of the distillery's former warehouses. Morrison Bowmore bottles all whisky produced at Bowmore Distillery and their other distilleries at a facility in Springburn, Glasgow. In August 2020, Bowmore announces a partnership with Aston Martin to produce the special edition Black Bowmore DB5 1964. With only 25 bottles going on sale, this rare release is positioned as a celebration of a defining moment in history for both luxury brands. 1964 saw Bowmore‚Äôs operation enter the modern age of distilling as coal fires made way for steam in heating the stills. It was the first distillation from this new boiler that produced the spirit which was to become the iconic Black Bowmore; a rich, indulgent single malt.

It is part of the AusLink National Network and is a vital link for road freight to transport goods to and from the two cities. It represents a major north‚Äìsouth transportation corridor in Tasmania and has the route 1 designation as part of the National Highway. The highway consists of various traffic lane arrangements, the most common being two lanes - one in each direction, with overtaking options and at-grade intersections. At both the Launceston and Hobart sections of the highway there are small portions of grade-separated dual carriageway. History Surveyor Grimes marked out the track from Hobart to Launceston in 1807, and Governor Macquarie followed the route in 1811 when he visited the colony accompanied by his wife. The party took five and a half days to complete the journey. Macquarie again visited the colony in 1821, when the road was fit for a carriage, but his journal records many different sections, and it was not until 1831 that the first regular coach service was operated by J. E. Cox. The first mailman, Robert Taylor, was appointed in 1816, he walked, leaving Hobart and Launceston on alternate Sundays and carrying the mail in a pack. The first record of movement between the two centres was in 1821 when then Governor Lachlan Macquarie selected sites for towns on the highway. It was known as the 'Main Road' or 'Hobart Road' for most of its history. In the 1930s it became known as the Midland Highway, and in the 2000s - it also had 'The Heritage Highway' label applied to it. The route of the highway originally ran between Hobart and Launceston, and passed through the localities which are now known as: Bridgewater, Brighton, Pontville, Mangalore, Bagdad, Dysart, Kempton, Melton Mowbray, Jericho, Oatlands, Antill Ponds, Woodbury, Tunbridge, Ross, Campbell Town, Conara Junction, Cleveland, Epping Forest, Perth, Breadalbane and Kings Meadows. Recent upgrades A number of two lane bypasses of towns and villages have been constructed since the early 1980s, including the Jericho bypass, which was opened to traffic in January 1982.Report for year 1981-1982, Parliament of Tasmania, Department of Main Roads, 1983, p. 23 Construction of grade separated dual carriageways leading south of Launceston and north of Hobart provided new superior facilities for Midland Highway traffic and shortened the route officially designated the Midland Highway. On 21 June 1983, what was then referred to as the 'Hobart Northern Outlet Road' was opened to traffic. Now called the Brooker Highway, this completed a grade- separated dual carriageway between Claremont Interchange and Granton in the northern suburbs of Hobart.Report for year 1982-1983, Parliament of Tasmania, Department of Main Roads, 1984, p. 21 Construction of the first stage of the Launceston Southern Outlet between Glen Dhu and Strathroy commenced in February 1981 and comprised the construction of 7.4 km of dual carriageway and included three major bridges, namely the Mt Pleasant Interchange, the Westbury Road Overpass and the Glen Dhu Overpass. The highway opened to traffic between the Glen Dhu interchange and the temporary connection onto the old Midland Highway at Jinglers Creek, Strathroy.Annual Report 1984-1985, Tasmania, Department of Main Roads, 1985, p. 18 The extension of the Launceston Southern Outlet Road between Breadalbane and Strathroy opened to traffic on 28 August 1987. This extension included the construction of 3.7 km of dual carriageway and a roundabout, linking the Outlet Road with the Midland Highway and Evandale Main Road.Annual Report 1987-1988, Tasmania, Department of Main Roads, 1988, p. 30 The third and final section of the Launceston Southern Outlet opened to traffic on 24 May 1988. The road works involved construction of 1 km of dual carriageway between Glen Dhu Overpass and the Frankland Street/Wellington Street intersection.Annual Report 1987-1988, Tasmania, Department of Main Roads, 1988, p. 32 In October 2012, the Brighton Bypass was officially opened, six months ahead of schedule. This bypass is a grade separated dual carriageway of the towns of Brighton and Pontville, just beyond Hobart‚Äôs northern suburbs. The total cost of the bypass was A$191 million.Annual Report 2012-13, Tasmanian Government, Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources, 2013, p. 7 On 16 April 2020, the second and final stage of the Perth Link Roads project was officially completed over 3 years ahead of schedule, including the opening of the long-overdue bypass of Perth.https://www.midlandhighway.tas.gov.au/projects/under_construction/perth_link_roads/traffic_changes_at_perth2 The bypass consists of 4.5km of dual carriageway, including a grade separated interchange with Illawarra Road, an interchange consisting of two roundabouts north of the Perth, and a roundabout south of the town centre, near the South Esk River bridge.https://www.midlandhighway.tas.gov.au/projects/under_construction/perth_link_roads Stage 1 of the project was completed in April 2018, including a new grade separated interchange at Breadalbane to bypass the existing roundabout which provides connections with Launceston Airport, Evandale and the old Midland Highway alignment to Youngtown and Kings Meadows. A new dual carriageway alignment was also constructed alongside the existing highway to connect the new Breadalbane interchange with the Perth bypass.https://www.midlandhighway.tas.gov.au/projects/completed_works/perth- breadalbane_dual_carriageway In 2002, a railway line underpass was constructed near Symmons Plains, south of Perth, to create a grade separated rail crossing on the highway itself. Significant numbers of overtaking lanes have also been extended or created. Future There has been mounting pressure for the Highway to be upgraded to a four-lane carriageway for 20 years to fall in line with the Auslink network of highways such as the Hume and Pacific as it is Tasmania's most heavily travelled stretch of long highway. The State and federal Liberal Parties have pledged $400 million to the funding of a dual- carriageway highway between Hobart and Launceston. The Liberal Party's claim is that when taking into account the Brighton Bypass, the Southern Outlet and the 34 km of overtaking lanes, there are of single-carriageway road on the Midland Highway. The Australian Labor Party stated that the 400 million-dollar budget is grossly underfunded,http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2010/02/19/128891_tasmania- news.html and could not possibly be constructed for that price. The Liberal Party defended the accusations that the $3 million/km budget is too low by stating that they are not planning any new road alignments or bypasses, just adding new lanes to the existing alignment. They have not stated if they plan to include grade separation or T-junctions and roundabouts. Should both the federal and state Liberal Parties win the next elections, they plan to upgrade this remaining stretch of road from 2014 progressively.http://www.liberal.org.au/news.php?Id=4831 Currently, there are several projects/proposals; Brighton The bypass on the southern stretch of the Highway was recently opened as part of the Southern Transport Investment Program, A Transport masterplan for the southern part of the Highway. The Transport study also caters for the Bagdad Bypass and the replacement of the ageing Bridgewater Bridge Perth The Perth Bypass is proposed to be constructed in 2 stages starting with the South Perth bypass which will result in a direct route to Illawarra Main Road - a vital link road to the Bass Highway. There are also plans to Duplicate the Midland Highway Between Perth and Launceston.http://www.dier.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/81958/Burnie_to_Hobart_Freight_Corridor_Midland_Highway_- _Duplication,_Perth_to_Breadalbane_01.pdf See also * Highways in Australia * List of highways in Tasmania * Southern Transport Investment Program * Brighton Transport Hub Notes References * Alexander, Alison (2005) The Midland Highway in Alexander, A.

It is the home baseball park for the Trenton Thunder, a Double-A level Minor League Baseball team of the Eastern League. The official seating capacity is 6,150. History The park was built for the 1994 season, although it opened several weeks late due to a rough winter that hampered construction. The sod also was unable to take properly that season, and the field did not properly drain, leading to rainouts on evenings where the sun had been out since noon. The drainage problem was fixed in 1995. The stadium's original name was \\"Mercer County Waterfront Park\\" when it opened in 1994. \\"Samuel J. Plumeri, Sr. Field\\" was added to the original name in 1999 by Trenton Thunder owner, Joe Plumeri (Chairman and CEO of Willis Group Holdings). Samuel J. Plumeri, Sr. was Joe Plumeri's father. In November 2012, the New Jersey-based Arm & Hammer purchased the ballpark's naming rights and will maintain its sponsorship through 2032. On July 8, 1996, the ballpark hosted the Double-A All-Star Game in which a team of National League- affiliated All-Stars defeated a team of American League-affiliated All-Stars, 6‚Äì2, before 8,369 people in attendance. In June 2014, the park hosted the first-ever, gold‚Äì and bronze‚Äìmedal games in baseball for the Special Olympics USA National Games. In 2018, it hosted the Eastern League All-Star Game. Attendance records Arm & Hammer Park set a record for game attendance on July 3, 2011, when the Thunder played the Altoona Curve. The game had the fortune of falling on the Independence Day holiday weekend, as well as featuring an injury rehabilitation appearance by Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees. The official attendance for the game was 9,212. When Alex Rodriguez played two games on back-to-back nights in August 2013, the official attendance was reported at 8,080 and 8,113, respectively. Features While the outfield in left and center field is covered with advertising signs that obscure views of Route 29 and nearby houses, the right field fence was kept as a short structure so that fans could see the Delaware River and Pennsylvania beyond. The river is also an inviting target for left-handed sluggers, several of whom have deposited baseballs into the water. Similar to Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ohio and its river border with Kentucky, Arm & Hammer Park also holds the possibility of having someone \\"hit one out of the state\\" since the middle of the Delaware River is the border with Pennsylvania. On June 7, 1994, Tony Clark became the first player to hit a fair ball into the Delaware. The stadium anchors an area of rejuvenation in Trenton that also includes office buildings, nightclubs, and the CURE Insurance Arena, several blocks away, for ice hockey, basketball and arena football.

Identified by Lewis H. Morgan in his 1871 work Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family, the Hawaiian system is one of the six major kinship systems (Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha, and Sudanese). Kinship system Graphic of the Hawaiian kinship system Within common typologies, the Hawaiian system is the simplest classificatory system of kinship. Relatives are distinguished only by generation and by gender. There is a parental generation and a generation of children. In this system, a person (called Ego in anthropology) refers to all females of his parents' generation as \\"Mother\\" and all of the males as \\"Father\\". In the generation of children, all brothers and male cousins are referred to as \\"Brother\\", and all sisters and female cousins as \\"Sister\\". In this way, a cross-cousin will be referred to as a \\"sibling\\". A correlation was found between the Hawaiian system and the prohibition of cross‚Äêcousin marriage, as the incest taboo is reflected in the semantics. Usage The Hawaiian system is named for the pre-contact kinship system of Native Hawaiian people in the Hawaiian Islands. Today, the Hawaiian system is most common among Malayo-Polynesian-speaking cultures; the Hawaiian language itself is Malayo-Polynesian. This system is usually associated with ambilineal descent groups, where economic production and child-rearing are shared between the genders. The Hawaiian system is found in approximately one-third of the world's societies, although they are usually small societies.

It enables programs wishing to use OpenGL to do so within a window provided by the X Window System. GLX distinguishes two \\"states\\": indirect state and direct state. History Silicon Graphics developed GLX as part of their effort to support OpenGL in the X Window System. In 1999 SGI released GLX under an open- source license, letting it be incorporated in XFree86 source code version 4.0 in 2000. From there, the code was inherited by the forked X.Org Foundation version of the X Window System X11R6.7.0. On September 19, 2008, SGI created a new SGI FreeB License Version 2.0, which \\"now mirrors the free X11 license used by X.Org\\" and \\"meets the free and open source software community's widely accepted definition of 'free'\\". In 2009 the Free Software Foundation endorsed the SGI Free License B to be a free-software license, and GLX to be an important free-software graphics project. As of 2011, GLX has reached version 1.4. The first internal implementation of GLX API, called GLcore, loaded a version of the software renderer of Mesa inside the X server and rendered the OpenGL commands in a window or pixmap. With the development of DRI, the ability to use hardware accelerated OpenGL through direct contexts was added (primarily used by videogames). In 2006, the popularization of the nested Xgl X server and Compiz compositing window manager lead to the development of Accelerated Indirect GLX (AIGLX). AIGLX brings hardware acceleration to the GLX (indirect context) applications by loading the Mesa DRI driver inside the X server. This method enables the sharing of GL objects between X clients using indirect contexts (they all are in the same address space in the X server) and also between a X client and the compositing window manager, thus accelerating composition. In 2008 the binding in GLcore to the Mesa software renderer was rewritten as a DRI interface module, called \`swrast_dri.so\`, improving the coupling of Mesa and the X server. Also in the year 2008 the new DRI2 was introduced to replace DRI, and with it a new model based in the Kernel mode-setting. In 2011, the Glamor project started, aiming to add a generic hardware-accelerated 2D X driver based in OpenGL. In 2013 Adam Jackson did a major rewrite of GLX code to consolidate the diverse paths from Glamor, indirect rendering, ... to one unique path to OpenGL's library libGL.

The clock has stood over the city for over 130 years. The present clock is the second \\"Town Clock\\"; the first collapsed in the 1870s, killing three people. The building on which it originally stood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but the clock tower itself is not. History The First Town Clock Dr. Asa Horr began the fundraising effort to build a town clock in Dubuque, Iowa in 1864. The clock was built by New York City's Naylor & Co. and its frame was designed by architect William Longhurst. George D. Wood gave a ten-year lease to the city for the clock to be placed on the John Bell and Company Store building which they owned. The building had originally housed a Congregational church and then \\"The Odeon\\", a German theater. That was followed by the post office, and then a concert hall before it became the home of the John Bell Company. with This first clock was placed on a tower of the building at a cost of $3,000. All men who had pledged at least $25 formed the Dubuque Town Clock Company to oversee its maintenance. On May 25, 1872, several people noticed cracks forming in the walls of the store building. Workers attempted to clear the location where they expected the clock to fall. At 5:16 PM, both the clock and the John Bell store collapsed, killing a child and two women who were inside the store at the time. An investigation into the matter reported that the foundation of the Bell Store was not sufficient to handle the clock's weight. It was also reported that construction next door was the primary cause of the accident. Losses from the disaster were estimated to be between $15,000 and $20,000. The Second Town Clock =Town Clock Building= Dubuque residents soon decided to replace the collapsed Town Clock. George Wood, who had owned the collapsed building, wanted the new town clock on his property, but John Bell was not interested in being a part of the project. Wood decided to build the new building on his own, while the tower was paid for through subscriptions. He cleared the remainder of the collapsed building and the neighboring Dr. Lay residence. A partnership between architects Fridolin Heer, Sr. and Edward Naescher designed the new building, as well as plans for a new three-story tower. A three-story brick Italianate building was designed to support the tower, which rose above the building. The city paid the $5,309.46 cost for the new clock, which began operating on April 17, 1873. The bell, which weighs over , was cast by Naylor & Co. and the clock was built by Boston firm Howard & Co. Time was recorded via a subterranean transit instrument which was used to observe the passage of stars. This provided accurate time readings to within half of a second and was always kept accurate within two seconds. For a number of years, the clock had a mechanical movement. Two employees spent an hour and a half winding cranks that were attached to the weights, which would allow the clock to operate for one week. In 1923, the Town Clock was almost dismantled when the financial cost of repairs led the city council to decide to remove the clock. However, the council changed their minds when a poll found that a majority of citizens favored keeping and maintaining it. In 1927, the clock was electrified by Interstate Power Company when a new Seth Thomas movement was placed in the clock. Western Union then synchronized the clock. =Urban Renewal= The clock as seen from Main Street With the urban renewal trend in the 1970s, the \\"Your Town Clock Committee\\" was organized. Their goal was to have the clock moved from its location at 825 Main Street to the new Town Clock Plaza, which the city council approved. The cost for the move was $70,000, which was raised through donations raised over a 14-month period. The Durrant Architecture firm of Dubuque designed a pre-caast four-column pedestal that was then placed in the plaza. The actual tower was brought to the site on Feb 12, 1971, and bolted to the pedestal. The faces of the clock were placed at the new location on Feb 16, 1971. Afterwards the cupola was placed at the new site, which completed the move. After the reassembly was complete, the clock stood about 108 feet above the street, which was about two feet taller than at its previous location. The move helped increase the visibility of the Town Clock, where it now served as the centerpiece at special events held at Town Clock Plaza. Otherwise, most of the traffic had moved out to the west end of the city. Main street had become an office park. In 1989, concerns were voiced about vibrations made by loud music and dancers possibly causing damage to the pedestal or the clock. The city studied the problem and stated its confidence that the Town Clock was structurally sound. =Recent events= In recent years, Main Street from Fifth street to Ninth street was reopened to automobile traffic after it was determined that the pedestrian plaza no longer was an effective option for the downtown area. This would have left the Town Clock standing in the middle of Main Street, but a small traffic circle was built around the clock. The clock continues to stand as a distinctive Dubuque landmark. Due to the cold it was frozen at 7:33, however it has been operational year round for several years.

Rice is noted as the designer of the logo for the series of Star Wars films, as well as many other film logo designs for print advertising and some filmed applications. Life Rice was educated at Western Illinois University, the University of Florida and the University of California, Irvine. Whilst studying at Florida, Rice married the screenwriter and novelist Daniel H. Vining. She and Vining divorced, and she later married the designer and Rolling Stone art director Anthony S. \\"Tony\\" Lane and worked under the name of Suzy Rice-Lane. Rice lived and worked in Maui, Hawaii, for eight years where she worked as a painter before returning to California. Work Suzy Rice's original Star Wars logo The final version of Rice's famous Star Wars logo (1977) Title sequence designer Dan Perri's original Star Wars logo Early in her career, Rice designed Dancing Madness (1976), a book written by Abe Peck, who was at the time an associate editor at Rolling Stone magazine. This led Rice to work as assistant art director and designer for the magazine under her then-married name of Suzy Vining. At the age of 22, she took up the position of art director at the Los Angeles advertising agency Seiniger Advertising. In late 1976, the agency was approached by the film distributor Twentieth Century Fox which needed to promote a new epic space opera, Star Wars, in post-production at the time. Fox commissioned a brochure which they would send out to cinema theater owners, and Rice was given the job of designing it. Rice liaised with Lucasfilm, Ltd. and on a visit to their visual effects production company, Industrial Light & Magic in Van Nuys, she met with the director, George Lucas. Lucas instructed Rice to produce a logo that would intimidate the viewer, and he reportedly asked for the logo to appear \\"very fascist\\" in style. Rice took a keen interest in typography and studied German font design for this task. Her response to her brief was to produce a bold logotype using an outlined, modified Helvetica Black. After some feedback from Lucas, Rice decided to join the S and T of STAR and the R and S of WARS. In the version approved by Lucas, the letter W had sharp, pointed tips. Lucas signed off the brochure in between takes while involved in second unit filming. The logo designed by Rice was not the original logo; Dan Perri, a seasoned Hollywood title sequence designer who developed the film's now-famous opening crawl, had produced an earlier logotype consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point. Perri's logo design was originally conceived to follow the same perspective as the opening crawl, and while it did not appear on-screen, it was used widely on pre- release print advertising and on cinema marquees. The producer of Star Wars, Gary Kurtz, was impressed with Rice's logo and selected it over Perri's design for the film's opening titles, after modifying the letter W to flatten the pointed tips originally designed by Rice. This finalised the design of one of the most recognisable logos in cinema design, although Rice's contribution was not credited in the film. Rice designed a poster in 1978 advertising a series of concerts of the Star Wars symphonic suite by John Williams. It features Rice's logo and an illustration by John Alvin of C-3PO and R2-D2 carrying one- man band kits of musical instruments. While employed at Seiniger Advertising, Rice was responsible for title design work and print advertising campaigns for a number of other films. She also designed a number of record album covers and various logos, posters and print advertising for the entertainment and healthcare industries. Years after her work for Seiniger Advertising and Lucasfilm, Rice returned to full-time education at the University of California, Irvine.

Both names in the Ndebele language mean \\"the men of the long shields\\", a reference to the Ndebele warriors' use of the Zulu shield and spear.  Background  The Matabele were descendants of a faction of the Zulu people who fled north during the reign of Shaka following the mfecane (\\"the crushing\\") or difaqane (\\"the scattering\\"). Shaka's general, Mzilikazi led his followers away from Zulu territory after a falling-out. In the late 1830s, they settled in what is now called Matabeleland in western Zimbabwe, but they claimed the sovereignty of a much wider area. The resulting kingdom was an Iron Age society in which the members of the tribe had a privileged position against outsiders whose lives were subject to the will of the king. In return for their privileges, however, the Ndebele people both men and women had to submit to a strict discipline and status within the hierarchy. That set out their duties and responsibilities to the rest of society. Infringements of any social responsibility were punished with death, subject to the king's seldom-awarded reprieve. This tight discipline and loyalty were the secret of the Ndebele's success in dominating their neighbours. Birthright After the death of Mzilikazi, the first king of the Ndebele nation, in 1868, the izinduna, or chiefs, offered the crown to Lobengula, one of Mzilikazi's sons from an inferior wife. Several impis (regiments) disputed Lobengula's ascent, and the question was ultimately decided by the arbitration of the assegai, with Lobengula and his impis crushing the rebels. Lobengula's courage in the battle led to his unanimous selection as king. Coronation The coronation of Lobengula took place at Mhlanhlandlela, one of the principal military towns. The Ndebele nation assembled in the form of a large semicircle, performed a war dance, and declared their willingness to fight and die for Lobengula. A great number of cattle were slaughtered, and the choicest meats were offered to Mlimo, the Ndebele spiritual leader, and to the dead Mzilikazi. Great quantities of millet beer were also consumed. About 10,000 Matabele warriors in full war costume attended the crowning of Lobengula. Their costumes consisted of a headdress and short cape made of black ostrich feathers, a kilt made of leopard or other skins and ornamented with the tails of white cattle. Around their arms they wore similar tails and around their ankles they wore rings of brass and other metals. Their weapons consisted of one or more long spears for throwing and a short stabbing-spear or assegai (also the principal weapon of the Zulu people). For defence, they carried large oval shields of ox-hide, either black, white, red, or speckled according to the impi (regiment) they belonged to. The Ndebele maintained their position due to the greater size and tight discipline in the army, to which every able-bodied man in the tribe owed service. \\"The Ndebele army, consisting of 15,000 men in 40 regiments [was] based around Lobengula's capital of Bulawayo.\\" thumb175pxleftThe chameleon and the fly: \\"Did you ever see a chameleon catch a fly? The chameleon gets behind the fly and remains motionless for some time, then he advances very slowly and gently, first putting forward one leg and then the other. At last, when well within reach, he darts his tongue and the fly disappears. England is the chameleon and I am that fly.\\" ‚Äî Lobengula Rule Lobengula was a big, powerful, man with a soft voice who was well loved by his people but loathed by foreign tribes. He had well over 20 wives, possibly many more; among them were Xwalile, daughter of king Mzila of the Gaza Empire, and Lozikeyi. His father, Mzilikazi, had around 200 wives. It is said that he weighed about . By the time he was in his 40s, his diet of traditional millet beer and beef had caused him to be obese according to European visitors. Lobengula was aware of the greater firepower of European guns so he mistrusted visitors and discouraged them by maintaining border patrols to monitor all travellers' movements south of Matabeleland. Early in his reign, he had few encounters with white men (although a Christian mission station had been set up at Inyati in 1859), but this changed when gold was discovered on the Witwatersrand within the boundaries of the South African Republic in 1886. In 1870 Lobengula granted Sir John Swinburne's London and Limpopo Mining Company the right to search for gold and other minerals on a tract of land in the extreme southwest of Matabeleland along the Tati River between the Shashe and Ramaquabane rivers, in what became known as the Tati Concession. However, it was not until about 1890 that any significant mining in the area commenced. Lobengula had been tolerant of the white hunters who came to Matabeleland; he would even go so far as to punish those of his tribe who threatened the whites. But he was wary about negotiation with outsiders, and when a British team (Francis Thompson, Charles Rudd and Rochfort Maguire) came in 1888 to try to persuade him to grant them the right to dig for minerals in additional parts of his territory, the negotiations took many months. Lobengula gave his agreement to Cecil Rhodes only when his friend, Leander Starr Jameson, a qualified medical doctor, who had once treated Lobengula for gout, proposed to secure money and weaponry for the Matabele in addition to a pledge that any people who came to dig would be considered as living in his kingdom. As part of this agreement, and at the insistence of the British, neither the Boers nor the Portuguese would be permitted to settle or gain concessions in Matabeleland. Lobengula sent two emissaries to the British queen, Victoria. However, they were delayed by Alfred Beit's associates at the port. The 25-year Rudd Concession was signed by Lobengula on 30 October 1888. 1893 King Lobengula and one of his Wives. Life in Bulawayo, ca. 1900 Matabele War The First Matabele War began in October 1893, and the British South Africa Company's overwhelming military force led to devastating losses for the Ndebele warriors, notably at the Battle of the Shangani. As early as December 1893, it was reported that Lobengula had been very sick, but his death sometime in early 1894 was kept a secret for many months, and the cause of his death remains inconclusive. By October 1897, the white colonists had successfully settled in much of the territory known later as Rhodesia, and Matabeleland was no more.

Coat of arms of the kingdom of Jerusalem. The Crusader state of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, created in 1099, was divided into a number of smaller seigneuries. According to the 13th-century jurist John of Ibelin, the four highest crown vassals (referred to as barons) in the kingdom proper were : *Counts of Jaffa and Ascalon *Princes of Galilee *Lords of Sidon *Lords of Oultrejordain There were also a number of independent seigneuries, and some land held under direct royal control, such as Jerusalem itself, Acre and Tyre.  Northern States  Aside from the Kingdom of Jerusalem, there were also three other major Crusader states in the Near East: *County of Edessa *County of Tripoli *Principality of Antioch These states nominally bore some dependency on the kingdom of Jerusalem. The King of Jerusalem was bound to reconcile them in case of disputes, or between a vassal Prince and the Latin Patriarich of Antioch, and could claim the regency in case of a vacancy or minority in their successions. Edessa was perhaps the most closely tied to the Kingdom, despite its distance. Its first two counts became kings of Jerusalem, and the county was bestowed as a royal gift on Joscelin I of Edessa. The County of Tripoli, the nearest of them, is sometimes considered to have been a vassal lordship under the king's suzerainty, although it preserved an extraordinary degree of sovereignty. Antioch was almost independent, for it was founded already before the kingship and its first holder was a rival of kings, the original leader of the crusade. Later in its history, it would at times recognize Byzantine or Armenian suzerainty, or none at all. These states dated their documents by the reigns of their own rulers, carried out their own foreign policy, and sent military aid to the Kingdom of their own will, rather than through feudal obligation; therefore, they are generally recognized as sovereign and are treated more fully under their own articles.  County of Jaffa and Ascalon  Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast, was fortified after the First Crusade, and was a separate county until the revolt of Hugh II of Le Puiset in 1134. Afterwards, it was usually held directly by the royal family or one of their relatives. After 1153, it became the double County of Jaffa and Ascalon, when the Fatimid fortress of Ascalon was conquered. It passed in and out of direct royal control, and became titular after the loss of the counties to the Muslims in the 13th-century . A number of seigneuries were vassals to the Count of Jaffa, including the Lordship of Ramla, Lordship of Ibelin and Lordship of Mirabel.  Counts of Jaffa  Jaffa was taken by the Crusaders in June 1099 during the siege of Jerusalem and became part of the kingdom shortly thereafter. The Counts of Jaffa were: *Royal domain, 1100‚Äì1110 *Hugh I of Jaffa, first cousin of king Baldwin II of Jerusalem, 1110‚Äì1118 * Albert of Namur, stepfather and regent to Hugh II, 1118‚Äì1122 *Hugh II of Jaffa, son of Hugh I, 1122‚Äì1134 *Melisende of Jerusalem, 1134‚Äì1151, with her husband Fulk (1131‚Äì1143) and her son Baldwin III (1143‚Äì1151) *Amalric I of Jerusalem, son of Melisende and Fulk, 1151‚Äì1153 (when he reached the age of maturity). Jaffa merged with newly-conquered Ascalon in 1153, becoming the County of Jaffa and Ascalon.  Counts of Jaffa and Ascalon  After the siege of Ascalon in 1153, the frontier fortress of Ascalon joined Jaffa in a combined county. The Counts of Jaffa and Ascalon were: *Amalric I of Jerusalem, 1153‚Äì1174 (as king from 1163) *Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, 1174‚Äì1176 *Sibylla of Jerusalem, 1176‚Äì1187, with her husbands William of Montferrat (1176‚Äì1177) and Guy of Lusignan (1180‚Äì1187) *Jaffa and Ascalon occupied by Ayyubids, 1187‚Äì1191 * Geoffrey of Lusignan (1191‚Äì1193), brother of Guy of Lusignan *Amalric II of Jerusalem, brother of Guy of Lusignan, 1193‚Äì1197 * Amalric II of Jerusalem, as king, with his wife Isabella I, 1197‚Äì1205 *Maria of Montferrat, 1205‚Äì1212, with her husband John of Brienne (1210‚Äì1212) *Isabella II of Jerusalem, under regency of her father John of Brienne, 1212‚Äì1221 *Walter IV of Brienne (1221‚Äì1244), nephew of John of Brienne and husband of Amalric II's granddaughter, 1221‚Äì1244 *John of Ibelin, son of Walter IV, 1244‚Äì1266 *Ascalon occupied by Ayyubids, 1247 * James of Ibelin, son of John, 1266‚Äì1268 *Jaffa occupied by Mamluks, 1268.  Lordship of Ramla  Originally held by the Bishop of Ramla-Lydda, in 1126 Ramla became part of Jaffa, and a separate lordship was created after Hugh II's revolt in 1134. The castle of Ibelin happened to be located quite near Ramla. It was later a part of the Lordship of Ibelin, inherited from Helvis of Ramla, daughter of Baldwin of Ramla and wife of Barisan of Ibelin. The Lords of Ramla were: *Baldwin I of Ramla, 1134‚Äì1138 *Barisan of Ibelin, 1138‚Äì1150 *Manasses of Hierges, 1150‚Äì1152) *Hugh of Ibelin, son of Barisan of Ibelin, 1152‚Äì1169 *Baldwin of Ibelin, brother of Hugh of Ibelin, 1169‚Äì1186 * Thomas of Ibelin, son of Baldwin of Ibelin, 1186‚Äì1187 *Ramla occupied by Ayyubids, 1187‚Äì1191 *Balian of Ibelin, brother of Baldwin of Ibelin, 1191‚Äì1193 *John of Ibelin, 1193‚Äì1247 *Lordship held by Counts of Jaffa and Ascalon after 1247.  Lordship of Ibelin  The Lordship of Ibelin was also created out of Jaffa (in the 1140s, or perhaps as early as 1134 after Hugh II's revolt). The lordship was given as a reward to Barisan of Ibelin, whose wife Helvis of Ramla already owned lands in the vicinity. The castle of Ramla, the family's other inheritance, was nearby, and together these territories formed a wealthy entity. Balian of Ibelin married Maria Comnena, widow of Amalric I of Jerusalem, and the Ibelins became the most powerful noble family of the kingdom, later ruling also over Beirut (see Lordship of Beirut, below). The Lords of Ibelin were: *Barisan of Ibelin, c. 1134‚Äì1150 *Hugh of Ibelin, son of Barisan of Ibelin, 1150‚Äì1170 *Balian of Ibelin, son of Barisan of Ibelin, 1170‚Äì1193 *John of Ibelin, 1193‚Äì1236 *Lordship held by Counts of Jaffa and Ascalon after 1236.  Lordship of Mirabel  Mirabel was separated from Jaffa after the revolt in 1134, and given to Baldwin of Ibelin in 1166, although it was separate from Ibelin. He was succeeded by his son Thomas of Ibelin, ruling from 1186‚Äì1188.  Principality of Galilee  The Principality of Galilee was established by Tancred in 1099 and was centered around Tiberias in Galilee proper, and was sometimes called the Principality of Tiberias or the Tiberiad. The principality became the fief of the families of Saint Omer, Montfaucon (Falcomberques), and then Bures. The principality was destroyed by Saladin in 1187, although the title was used by relatives and younger sons of the kings of Cyprus (the titular kings of Jerusalem) afterwards. The principality had its own vassals, the Lordships of Beirut, Nazareth and Haifa, which often had their own sub-vassals.  Princes of Galilee  The Princes of Galilee were: * Tancred, 1099‚Äì1101 * Hugh of Fauquembergues, 1101‚Äì1106 * Gervaise de Bazoches, 1106‚Äì1108 * Tancred, second reign, 1109‚Äì1112 * Joscelin I of Edessa (as Lord of Courtenay), 1112‚Äì1119 * William I of Bures, 1120‚Äì1141 * Elinand, 1142‚Äì1148 * William II of Bures, brother of Elinand, 1148‚Äì1158 * Eschiva of Bures, 1159‚Äì1187, with Gautier of Saint Omer (1159‚Äì1171) and Raymond III of Tripoli (1174‚Äì1187) * Galilee occupied by Ayyubids, 1187‚Äì1240 * Eschiva of Saint Omer, granddaughter of William II, 1240‚Äì1247, with Odo of Montb√©liard (1240‚Äì1247) * Galilee taken by Ayyubids, 1247. The sons of William I Iof Bures were titular Princes of Galilee after the death of Eschiva of Bures in 1187: Hugh II of Saint Omer from 1187‚Äì1204 and Raoul of Saint Omer from 1204‚Äì1219. Eschiva of Saint Omer was daughter of Raoul of Saint Omer, and she was titular Princess of Galilee from 1219‚Äì1240 and 1247 until after 1265. He husband was titular Prince of Galilee from 1219‚Äì1240.  Lordship of Beirut  Beirut was captured in 1110 and given to Fulk of Gu√Ænes. It was one of the longest- lived seigneuries, surviving until the final collapse of the kingdom in 1291, although only as a tiny strip on the Mediterranean coast surrounding Beirut. It was important for trade with Europe, and had its own vassals within the Principality of Galilee. The Lords of Beirut were : *Fulk of Gu√Ænes, 1110‚Äì1125 *Walter I of Brisebarre, 1125‚Äì1138 *Guy I of Brisebarre, 1138‚Äì1156 *Walter II of Brisebarre, 1156‚Äì1179 *Walter III of Brisebarre, 1179‚Äì1187 *Beirut occupied by Ayyubids, 1187‚Äì1198 *John I of Ibelin, 1204‚Äì1236 *Balian of Ibelin, 1236‚Äì1247 *John II of Ibelin, 1247‚Äì1264 *Isabella of Ibelin, 1264‚Äì1282, with her husbands and regent: **Hugh II of Cyprus, 1265‚Äì1267 **Haymo L√©trange, 1272‚Äì1273 **Alice de la Roche, as regent to her daughter Isabella, 1274‚Äì1277 **Nicholas Aleman, 1277 **William Barlais, 1278‚Äì1282 *Eschive d'Ibelin, 1282‚Äì1291, with her husbands: **Humphrey of Montfort, 1282‚Äì1284 **Guy of Cyprus, 1291 *Beirut taken by Mamluks, 1291. The sub-vassals of Beirut were the Lordship of Banias and the Lordship of Toron. = Lordship of Banias = Banias (Caesarea Philippi) was under the control of the Assassins from 1126‚Äì1129, when it was given to the Franks following the purge of the sect in Damascus by Taj al-Muluk Buri. The area was in dispute from 1132‚Äì1140 when Banias was merged with Toron under Humphrey II of Toron. It fell to Nur ad-Din in 1164, and when recovered it became part of the Lordship of Joscelin III of Edessa (see below). = Lordship of Toron = The castle of Toron was built by Hugh of St. Omer to help capture Tyre, and was given to Humphrey I of Toron in 1107. The lords of Toron tended to be very influential in the kingdom. Humphrey II was constable of Jerusalem. This grandson Humphrey IV was married to Isabella, Amalric I's daughter. Toron was later merged with the royal domain of Tyre. Toron had two vassals of its own, the Lordship of Castel Neuf, which fell to Nur ad-Din in 1167, and the Lordship of Toron-Ahmud, which was sold to the Teutonic Knights in 1261. The Lords of Toron were: * Humphrey I of Toron, before 1109‚Äìafter 1136 * Humphrey II of Toron, son of Humphrey I, before 1137‚Äì1179 * Humphrey IV of Toron, grandson of Humphrey II, 1179‚Äì1183 * Royal domain, 1183‚Äì1187 * Toron occupied by Ayyubids, 1187‚Äì1229 * Alice of Armenia, great-granddaughter of Humphrey IV, 1229‚Äìafter 1236 * Maria of Antioch-Armenia, granddaughter of Alice, after 1236‚Äì1239 * Toron occupied by Ayyubids, 1239‚Äì1241 * Toron merged with Lordship of Tyre, 1241.  Lordship of Nazareth  Nazareth was the original site of the Latin Patriarch, established by Tancred. It was created as a seigneury in Galilee in 1115. The Archbishop of Nazareth also ruled over Haifa.  Lordship of Haifa  Haifa was partly an ecclesiastical domain ruled by the Archbishop of Nazareth, and partly created from other lands in the Principality of Galilee. The Lords of Haifa were: *Geldemar Carpenel, 1100‚Äì1101 *Tancred, 1101‚Äì1103 * Rorgius, 1103‚Äì1107 * Pagan, 1107‚Äì1112 *Royal domain, 1112‚Äì1187 *Haifa occupied by Ayyubids, 1187‚Äì1191 * Vivian, c. 1140s * Pagan, 1190‚Äì? * Rorgius II, ?‚Äì1244? * Garsias Alvarez, c. 1250 * Gilles d'Estrain, c. 1260 *Haifa taken by Mamluks, 1265.  Lordship of Sidon  The cities of Sidon and Caesarea Maritima (Caesarea) were captured by the Crusaders between 1101 and 1110. A noblemen Eustace I Grenier, a trussed advisor of Baldwin I of Jerusalem, was granted the lordship of both cities. He founded a dynasty that ruled until the 1260s when they were lost to the conquering Mongols and Mamluks.  Lords of Sidon  Sidon became part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem following the siege of Sidon in 1110. The Lords of Sidon were: * Eustace I Grenier, 1110‚Äì1123 * Gerard Grenier, son of Eustace I, 1123‚Äì1171 * Renaud Grenier, son of Gerard, 1171‚Äì1187 * Occupied by Ayyubids, 1187‚Äì1197 * Renaud Grenier, lordship restored, 1197‚Äì1202 * Balian I Grenier, son of Renaud, 1202‚Äì1239 * Julian Grenier, son of Balian I, 1239‚Äì1260 * Sidon destroyed by Ayyubids in 1249 and Mongols in 1260 * Sidon sold to the Knights Templar, 1260.  Lordship of Caesarea  Caesarea was captured in 1101 and given to the Archbishop of Caesarea. The Lords of Caearea were : *Eustace I Grenier, 1110‚Äì1123 *Walter I Grenier, son of Eustace I, 1123‚Äì1154 *Hugh Grenier, son of Walter I, 1154‚Äì1169 *Guy Grenier, son of Hugh, fl. 1170s *Walter II Grenier, brother of Guy, c. 1180s‚Äì1189/1191 *Caesarea occupied by Ayyubids, 1187‚Äì1191 *Juliana Grenier, sister of Walter II, 1189/1193‚Äì1213/1216, with husbands: **Guy of Brisebarre (possible lord), after 1183 **Aymar de Lairon, 1189/1193‚Äì1213/1216 *Walter III, son of Juliana and Guy of Brisebarre, 1213/1216‚Äì1229 *John, son of Walter III, 1229‚Äì1238/1241 *Margaret, daughter of John, 1238/1241‚Äì1255/1265 with her husband: **John Aleman, 1238/1243‚Äì1264/1265 *Nicholas Aleman, son of John Aleman (possible lord or titular lord), d. 1277 *Caesarea taken by Mamluks, 1265 *John of Nevilles, 1384‚Äì? *John Gorap?  Lordship of the Schuf  The Schuf was created out of the Lordship of Sidon as a sub-vassal around 1170. It was centred on the Cave of Tyron. Julian of Sidon sold it to the Teutonic Knights in 1256.  Lordship of Oultrejordain The Lordship of Oultrejordain, consisting of land with an undefined boundary to the east of the Jordan River, was one of the largest and most important seigneuries. It was an important source of revenue, from the Muslim caravan routes that existed there. The last lord, Raynald of Ch√¢tillon, received Oultrejordain by marrying its heiress, Stephanie of Milly. Raynald considered himself Prince of Oultrejordain, not subject to the King, and was especially hostile to the Muslims. He was largely responsible as the pretence for Saladin's invasion of the kingdom in 1187. Saladin conquered much of the area in 1187 and personally executed Raynald at the Battle of Hattin. The Lords of Oultrejordain were: * Roman of Le Puy, possibly 1118‚Äì1126 * Pagan the Butler, 1126‚Äì1147 * Maurice of Montreal, nephew of Pagan, 1147‚Äì1161 * Philip of Milly, with his wife Isabella, daughter of Maurice, 1161‚Äì1168 * Stephanie de Milly, daughter and heiress, whose husbands exercised the powers of the lordship: ** Humphrey III of Toron, 1168‚Äì1173 ** Miles of Plancy, 1173‚Äì1174 ** Raynald of Ch√¢tillon, 1176‚Äì1187 * Oultrejordain lost to Saladin, 1187.  Other seigneuries  (Titular lords/princes are italicized)  Lordship of Adelon  The Lordship of Adelon seems to have been created after the center of the kingdom was moved to Acre, and held some influence under Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. *Adam *Agnes, c. 1200 *Daniel of Terremonde *Daniel II of Terremonde *Peter, c. 1250 *Jordan  Lordship of Arsuf  Arsuf, located north of Jaffa, (called Arsur by the Crusaders) was captured in 1101 but remained a royal domain until around 1163 when John of Arsuf became lord. The Lords of Arsuf were: *Royal domain, 1101‚Äì1163 *John of Arsuf, 1163‚Äì1177 *Arsuf occupied by Ayyubids, 1187‚Äì1191 *Melisende of Arsuf, sister of John of Arsuf, 1177‚Äì at least 1218, with Thierry of Orguenes (c. 1190s) *John of Ibelin, husband of Melisende, before 1209‚Äì1236 *John of Arsuf, son of Melisende of Arsuf and John of Ibelin, 1236‚Äì1258 *Balian of Ibelin, 1258‚Äì1261 *Arsuf sold to Knights Hospitaller, 1261 *Arsuf taken by Mamluks, 1265 *Balian of Ibelin, titular 1261‚Äì1277 *John of Ibelin, son of Balian, 1277‚Äì1309 *Balian of Ibelin, son of John, 1309‚Äì1333 *Philip of Ibelin, son of Balian, 1333‚Äì1373. Lordship of Bethlehem *Balian II of Ibelin (died before April 19, 1316), also titular Prince of Galilee.  Lordship of Bethsan  Bethsan was occupied by Tancred in 1099; it was never part of Galilee, despite its location, but became a royal domain in 1101, probably until around 1120. It occasionally passed back under royal control until new Lords were created. *Adam of Bethune *Adam II, son of Adam *John, ‚Äì after 1129 *Guermond, son of Adam II, ‚Äì after 1174 *Hugh of Gibelet *Walter *Adam III *Guermond II, c. 1210 *Baldwin *Walter, c. 1310? *Thibaut  Lordship of Blanchegarde  Blanchegarde (modern Tell es-Safi) was built by Fulk of Jerusalem in 1142, as part of the royal domain, and administered by the royal castellans. It became a lordship in 1166, when it was given to Walter III Brisebarre, lord of Beirut. *Walter III Brisebarre, 1166‚Äì1187 *Blanchegarde taken by Ayyubids, 1191, 1192 *Gilles, c. 1210 *Raoul, ?‚Äì1265 *Amalric Barlais, 1265‚Äì?  Lordship of Caymont  Caymont was created in 1192 after the Third Crusade for Balian of Ibelin, who had lost his other territories to Saladin. It eventually passed into the royal domain.  Lordship of Dera  Little is known about Dera, except that it was created in 1118.  Lordship of Hebron  Hebron, known to the Crusaders as \\"Castellion Saint Abraham\\", was one of the earliest seigneuries created. Hebron had been under royal control at various times before 1149. It had its own sub-vassal, the Lordship of Beth Gibelin, created by Fulk in 1149. Soon afterwards Hebron became a royal domain and Beth Gibelin passed to the Knights Hospitaller. *Geldemar Carpenel, 1100 *Gerard of Avesnes, 1100‚Äì1101 *Royal domain, 1102‚Äì1104 *Hugh of Rebecques, 1104 *Royal domain, 1104‚Äì1108 *Walter Mahomet, 1108‚Äì1118 *Royal domain, 1118‚Äì1120 *Baldwin of Saint Abraham, 1120‚Äì1136 *Hugh II of Saint Abraham, 1136‚Äì1149 *Royal domain, 1149‚Äì1161 *Hebron merged with Lordship of Oultrejordain, 1161 *Under Ayyubid control, 1187‚Äì1191 *Royal domain, 1191 *Hebron destroyed by Khwarazmains, 1244.  Lordship of Montgisard  Montgisard was built as a defense against Nur ad-Din, and was the site of the Battle of Montgisard in 1177. *William, c. 1155 *John *Aimard, c. 1198 *Reginald, c. 1200 *William, c. 1230 *Robert, c. 1240 *Henry (?) *Balian, c. 1300 *William *Baldwin *Robert *John *James, c. 1400.  Lordship of Nablus  Nablus was first captured in 1099 by Tancred, and named \\"Naples\\" by the Crusaders. It later became a separate lordship out of part of Oultrejordain. It was lost during Saladin's conquest of the kingdom. *Royal domain, 1099‚Äì *Pagan the Butler, 1126‚Äì? *Guy of Milly, ?‚Äì1142 or between 1138‚Äì1144 *Philip of Milly, son of Guy, 1142 or between 1138‚Äì1144‚Äì1161 *Maria Comnena, received the lordship from her first husband Amalric I of Jerusalem *Balian of Ibelin, 1177, Maria's second husband *Stephanie of Ibelin, sister of Balian *Nablus taken by Ayyubids, 1187. Nablus was technically part of the royal domain, and also had a royal viscount, who governed in place of the monarch : *Ulric, 1115‚Äì1152 *Baldwin Bubalus, c. 1159‚Äì1162 *Baldwin, son of Ulric, c. 1162‚Äì1176 *Amalric, c. 1176‚Äì1187.  Lordship of Scandalion  Scandalion, today's Iskandarouna in the Tyre District of the South Governorate of Lebanon, was built in 1116 as a royal domain. Denys Pringle quotes William of Tyre indicating the year 1117 for the date when Baldwin I has built the castle of Scandalion. It became a lordship by 1148 when Guy of Scandalion was created lord. *Guy of Scandalion, c. 1150 *Peter *Raymond, c. 1200 *William of Mandelee *Raymond *Philip, c. 1270 *Humphrey, c. 1300 *Eschiva, c. 1370.  Lordship of Tyre  Conrad of Montferrat practically created this lordship during the Third Crusade by defending it, as it was the only remaining town of the kingdom. Tyre, always an important town, had been part of the royal domain, and after Conrad, it also belonged to the kings personally. After the kingdom moved to Acre, coronations took place in Tyre. Sometime after 1246, Tyre was conferred upon Philip of Montfort by Henry I of Cyprus (then Regent of Jerusalem) for his support of the Ibelin (baronial) party against the Imperialists. The grant was confirmed c. 1269 by Hugh III of Cyprus, with a clause allowing Hugh to buy back the lordship. This was exercised in 1284, when the city was given to his sister Margaret, already the Dowager Lady of Tyre. The Lords of Tyre were: * Royal domain, 1124‚Äì1129 * Fulk of Anjou, 1129‚Äì1131 * Royal domain, 1131‚Äì1187 * Conrad of Montferrat, 1190‚Äì1192 * Royal domain. 1192‚Äì1246 * Philip of Montfort, 1246‚Äì1269 * John of Montfort, son of Philip, 1269‚Äì1283 * Humphrey of Montfort, brother of John, 1283‚Äì1284 * Royal domain, 1284‚Äì1289 * Amalric of Lusignan, 1289‚Äì1291 * Tyre taken by Mamluks, 1291. Lordship of Joscelin III of Edessa  This lordship, often called the seigneurie de Joscelin, was an unusual creation given to Joscelin III, the nominal Count of Edessa, which had been lost long before. It was created around 1176 when Joscelin married Agnes of Milly, and was formed from royal land around Acre. Joscelin had only daughters, who married into the families of von Henneberg and Mandelee. The heirs sold in 1220 the seigneury to the Teutonic Knights, who used the place near Acre as their fortress in Outremer. The archives of the lordship are the only baronial archives of Outremer to survive.Susan Edington and Alan V. Murray, \\"Western Sources\\", in Alan V. Murray, ed., The Crusades to the Holy Land: The Essential Reference Guide (ABC-CLIO, 2015), p. 255.  Inheritance in the Kingdom of Jerusalem  Lordships in the Kingdom of Jerusalem were usually hereditary, in principle, but in practice the circumstances were such that their holders did not form long uninterrupted lines of inheritance, which was contrary to the usual patterns of succession in Europe. Firstly, in the early years of the kingdom, lords sought out their own territories, and lordships changed hands often. Secondly, the average lifespan of male lords in Palestine was rather low, due to the constant state of warfare and violence, which led to inheritances by females and/or extinction of whole families. Succession from father to son happened more rarely than in more peaceful countries in Europe. Female succession opened up the option for the liege or the monarch to reward services, loyalty and capability, as well as achievements, by giving an heiress' hand in marriage and her inherited lordship to a \\"new man\\". A typical succession pattern was a father followed by a daughter, sister, or niece, who was then married to a man worthy of some reward, who then himself succeeded to the territory. This made the succession unpredictable and caused the family holding a particular territory to change once or perhaps even more often in a generation. Sometimes families became extinct, or escaped from Syria, and either a distant relative came to claim their land, or more usually, their liege gave the lordship to another family. Sometimes a lord was condemned for treason, rebellion or some other reason, and he and possibly his descendants were disinherited from the lordship. Occasionally, vacant lordships were put into the royal domain, but more often, another person received the lordship. A less careful observer may think that they were not hereditary, but almost always their succession took place according to feudal rights of inheritance, utilizing the relatively high number of heiresses. Many of these seigneuries ceased to exist after the loss of Jerusalem in 1187, and the rest of them after the fall of Acre in 1291, yet they often had Cypriot or European claimants for decades or centuries afterwards; these claimants, of course, held no actual territory in Syria after the mainland kingdom was lost.

He is known for his printmaking skills and installation art, as well as his creative artistic use of language, words, and text and how they have affected our understanding of the world. He is an A.D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University. He was awarded the MacArthur Fellows Program in 1999 and the Fukuoka Prize in 2003. Biography Born in Chongqing in 1955, Xu grew up in Beijing. His father was the head of the history department at Peking University. In 1975, near the end of the Cultural Revolution, he was relocated to the countryside for two years as part of Mao Zedong's \\"re-education\\" policy. Returning to Beijing in 1977, he enrolled at the Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA) in Beijing, where he joined the printmaking department and also worked during a short period of time as a teacher, receiving his Masters in Fine Art in 1987. After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, his recent work came under scrutiny from the government and received harsh criticism for what was perceived as a critique of the Chinese government. Due to the political pressure and artistic restrictions of the post-Tiananmen period in China, Xu Bing, like many of his contemporaries, moved to the United States in 1990 where he was invited by the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He then resided to the United States until his appointment as vice-president of the Beijing CAFA in 2008. In 1990‚Äì91, Xu had his first exhibition in the United States at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison's Elvehjem Museum of Art (now Chazen Museum of Art) including his installations A Book from the Sky and Ghosts Pounding the Wall. In Book from the Sky, the artist invented 4,000 characters and hand-carved them into wood blocks, then used them as movable type to print volumes and scrolls, which are displayed laid out on the floor and hung from the ceiling. The vast planes of text seem to convey ancient wisdom, but are in fact unintelligible. The Glassy Surface of a Lake, a site-specific installation for the Elvehjem, was on view in 2004-05. In this work, a net of cast aluminum letters forming a passage from Henry David Thoreau's Walden stretches across the museum's atrium and pours down into an illegible pile of letters on the floor below. Working in a wide range of media, Xu creates installations that question the idea of communicating meaning through language, demonstrating how both meanings and written words can be easily manipulated. He received a MacArthur Foundation grant in July 1999, presented to him for \\"originality, creativity, self- direction, and capacity to contribute importantly to society, particularly in printmaking and calligraphy.\\" In 2003 he exhibited at the then new Chinese Arts centre in Manchester, and in 2004 he won the inaugural \\"Artes Mundi\\" prize in Wales for Where does the dust collect itself?, an installation using dust he collected in New York City on the day after the destruction of the World Trade Center. He won also a half year of free work and study at the American Academy in Berlin 2004. Xu Bing was appointed the new vice president of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, March 2008. Art Early works While at the Central Academy of Fine Arts Xu Bing mastered the Socialist Realism style of art so predominant during the Maoist era. After graduating with his degree in printmaking, the artist veered away and created simple but dramatic woodcuts, such as Shattered Jade (1977) and Bustling Village on the Water (1980‚Äì81, ÁπÅÂøôÁöÑÊ∞¥‰π°). In 1987, Xu Bing returned to his training in printmaking to create large and elaborate installation pieces like Book from the Sky (1987) and Ghosts Pounding the Wall (1990). Installation pieces =A Book from the Sky= Xu Bing's Tianshu (\\"Book From the Sky\\") is a large installation featuring precisely laid out rows of books and hanging scrolls with written \\"Chinese\\" texts. Even so, this work challenges our very approach to language because of the unique nature of the text written on the paper. First presented in Beijing in 1988, the learned √©lite felt slighted by the artists' bold move to design and print over 4,000 characters that looked Chinese but were completely meaningless according to standard Mandarin. Xu Bing infuses his work with meaning by stirring confusion and discomfort in his audience, mostly due to the fact that the Chinese characters used in these texts are not \\"real\\" characters. This piece was well received in China until 1989, whereupon the social and political drama of the Tiananmen Square protests led the government to look askance at Xu Bing's Tianshu. Leaving China in 1991 for the political and artistic freedom of the United States, Xu Bing continued to explore and express his thoughts on deconstructing language to challenge our most \\"natural\\" cultural assumptions. His thought-provoking work enticed Western audiences, and he soon became one of the leading artists in the modern Chinese art scene. =Ghosts Pounding the Wall= Using his background in print-making, in May and June 1990 Xu Bing and a team of art students and help from local residents began a monumental project: creating a rubbing from a section of the Great Wall at Jinshanling. In order to create the rubbings, Xu Bing used entirely traditional Chinese methods and materials for stone rubbing, including rice paper and ink. Measuring 32m x 15m, the resulting installation piece consists of 29 rubbings of different sections of the Great Wall. As in the case of many of his works, Xu Bing directly related his colossal piece, Ghosts Pounding the Wall, to the political situation in China. While surveying his work while installed at Elvehjem Museum of Art, Xu Bing said that his Great Wall represents \\"a kind of thinking that makes no sense and is very conservative, a really closed-in thinking that symbolizes the isolationism of Chinese politics.\\" The prints of the Great Wall rise up on either side of the exhibit, making the viewer seem small and insignificant in comparison to the massive, looming representations of solid stone walls. =Square Word Calligraphy= An example of Xu Bing's 'Square Word' calligraphy, combining Latin characters into forms that resemble Chinese characters. The word is 'wiki'. From 1994 he began writing Chinese characters which were nonsensical to Chinese people but understandable to English speakers because they were one-block words made of English letters bent to the shape of hanzi. He called this New English Calligraphy, and gave lessons in how to write the characters. =Background Story= In his series Background Story, Xu Bing uses unusual materials in order to create a deceptively typical Chinese Scroll Painting. From the front, the piece very much resembles a traditional Shan Shui (Landscape) scroll painting, with images of mountains, trees, and rivers. However, when seen from behind, the viewer is surprised to find that the beautiful \\"painting\\" is in fact created by using the shapes and shadows of random natural plant debris. Once again, Xu Bing challenges his audience's basic assumptions and shows them that everything is not always as it first seems. =Phoenix project= In 2008, after returning to China to take the position at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Xu Bing was asked to create a sculpture for the atrium of the World Financial Center, which was then being developed in Beijing. He was shocked by primitive working conditions he saw at the construction site, later saying that they \\"made my skin quiver.\\" He was inspired to construct two large sculptures in the form of birds that are made largely out of construction debris and tools that he salvaged from the site. The larger sculpture, 100 feet (30 meters) long, is identified as a male and named Feng in accordance with the Chinese phoenix tradition. The smaller one is 90 feet (27 meters) long and is a female named Huang. Originally planned to take four months, the sculptures ultimately took two years to build; by that time the developers of the complex had decided the sculptures did not meet their needs. They were displayed at the Today Art Museum in Beijing and at the Shanghai World Expo before coming to the United States in 2012. After a year at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, they were then moved to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, where they were unveiled to the public on 1 March 2014. They were suspended from the ceiling of the nave, where they are now expected to spend about a year. The Phoenix sculpture is the subject of the documentary Xu Bing: Phoenix by Daniel Traub. Later mediums Xu Bing's art medium has evolved over the years, morphing from one style to the next: print-making and wood-block carving, installation art, live installation art, metalwork and sculpture, landscaping, and even virtual and digital mediums. Taking installation art a step further, Xu Bing focused on live installation art by using animals in his exhibits, such as in the case of the Silkworm Series and a Case Study of Transference (using silkworms and pigs, respectively) in 1994, or by showcasing sheep in The Net (1997). Later he explored the combination of modern and traditional mediums, as in the case of Background Story (2004‚Äìpresent) where his work imitates a traditional Chinese brush and ink scroll from the front, but is in fact designed by means of the projected shadows of plants and sticks. Even more recently, Xu Bing has delved into sculpture and metalworking, as seen in Monkeys Grasping the Moon (2001) and the Phoenix Project (2010). Influences and themes Xu Bing's art mostly reflects cultural issues which raged during his early life in China. Most notably, the cultural and linguistic reforms enacted by the Communist Party in China under Mao Zedong's leadership weigh heavily on modern Chinese artists who lived through this period. Similarly, the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976) also rankles the modern Chinese artistic consciousness even though different artists have focused on different angles. Xu Bing in particular plays with the notion of the paradox between the power and fickleness of language, of what it means to be human, and of how our perceptions color our worldview. Xu Bing plays incessantly with the role, purpose, and reality of language. Early in his life his father would make him write a page of characters a day, encouraging him to not only copy their form to perfection, but also to capture their spirit, their essence. During Mao's cultural reformations and the reorganization of the standard Chinese language, Xu Bing experienced the constant reformation of words. This constant linguistic change influenced his art: Xu Bing emphasizes the immortality of the essence of language while vividly illustrating the impermanence and capriciousness of words themselves. In this way language becomes malleable and it can be fashioned to either liberate or control. Just as it is nigh impossible to detangle life from politics during the Cultural Revolution era (and its ramifications in decades to follow), Xu Bing also intertwines political messages into his art. It was not until 2008 that Xu Bing set aside his post-Maoist reactionary art and invested in other topics. For example, he took on environmental projects such as Forest Project, which encouraged the \\"uninterrupted flow of funds from developed countries to Kenya, earmarked for the planting of new trees.\\" Even so, his focus is always on the effect that environmental issues have on people, such as the villages in Kenya, not necessarily the effects on the landscape or on the political situation. At the turn of the millennium, a new defining social pattern emerged after the terrorist attacks in the United States on 9/11, 2001. Tension grew between the West and the Middle East, finally exploding into what was labeled as \\"the War on Terror.\\" This situation gave rise to social themes of anxiety and hopelessness, which eventually have seeped into the realm of the arts. Even so, some artists like Xu Bing chose to explore the serenity found in the midst of chaos, as illustrated in his work Where does the Dust Itself Collect? (2004, 2011). For this piece, the artist gathered dust from the aftermath of the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York after September 11, 2001, and uses it to recreate the gray film that covered Manhattan in the weeks following the attacks. Stenciled in the dust, a Buddhist poem reads, \\"As there is nothing from the first, where does the dust itself collect?\\" Using this tragedy as an expression of the human narrative, Xu Bing contemplates the relationship between the material and the spiritual, and he explores \\"the complicated circumstances created by different world perspectives.\\" Awards and honors * Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters, Columbia University, New York (2010) * Southern Graphics Council Lifetime Achievement Award (2006) * International Association of Art Critics Award for \\"Best Installation or Single Work of Art in a Museum, New England\\" (2006) * The Youth Friends Award, New York (2005) * Artes Mundi Prize (2004) * American Academy in Berlin Coca-Cola Fellowship (2004) * Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize (2003) * MacArthur Award (1999) * Pollack Krasner Foundation Prize (1998) Partial list of works * Lanman Shanhua (Brilliant Mountain Flowers) Magazine (1975‚Äì1976) * A Book from the Sky (1987‚Äì1991) * Ghosts Pounding the Wall (1990‚Äì1991) * A.B.C....

The current structure was built from 1891 to 1893 to replace an earlier building. These are believed to be the only two structures to house the county courts and administrative offices. The courthouse houses several county government offices including the county auditor, treasurer, attorney, and facilities for the Iowa District Court for Dubuque County. History Information about the first courthouse in Dubuque is sparse. The first known attempt at a courthouse were the plans for a two- story log structure in 1836, but it was never built. By 1843 it was decided that the increased private business in Dubuque necessitated an increase in public business. Therefore, the county built a red brick building to house its records and offices. It is possible that this building was already under construction as there are records of expenditures for brick, lumber, lime, ironwork, and architectural fees dating back to 1839. An addition was built onto the front of this building in 1856. By 1869 there was talk of building a new courthouse as the county had outgrown this building and it was considered outdated and ill-shaped. Even after a petition for a new courthouse was presented in 1878, there was no serious movement toward construction until 1890. The United States Congress had authorized the use of Washington Square for the new courthouse, but the choice was made to locate it on the site of the old one. County officials chose local architect Fridolin Heer, designer of Sacred Heart Church and several other notable buildings in the city. Twenty- five year bonds totaling $125,000 were sold in April 1891, and the cornerstone was laid on July 11 of the same year. The building was completed two years later. The Dubuque County Courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Its significance is derived from its association with county government, and the political power and prestige of Dubuque as the county seat. with The adjacent Dubuque County Jail is a National Historic Landmark. Architecture Historic Dubuque County Jail with courthouse on right Heer designed the structure in the Beaux-Arts style with elements of the Renaissance and the Romanesque styles. It is constructed of Bedford limestone on the first floor and red brick and molded terra cotta on the floors above. The frieze is composed of galvanized iron or zinc. The building has a footprint of . It is five-stories topped by a central tower surmounted by a statue of Justice. All total, the building rises to a height of . Upon completion, 12 classic statues of laminated pewter adorned the roof, however only six remain. Some reports say the others were removed during World War I to provide materiel for the war effort. The interior features the shaft of the tower that terminates on the fourth floor with a dome of stained glass. Woodwork and fittings are of oak with carvings that are done in a Richardsonian character. Renovations Renovations were done to the building over the years, especially in the 1980s. Changes include the installation of a glass elevator, a granite fountain was placed on the ground floor, and the entrances into the building were moved to the ground level from the second floor. Gold leaf was applied to the tower dome. Given the various weather conditions, it did not hold and it had to be repaired. The county reevaluated security at the courthouse following the murders of a judge in Georgia and a judge's family in Illinois. All entrances, but one, were closed and visitors and their possessions were screened.

(1951). Effects of group pressure on the modification and distortion of judgments. In H. Guetzkow (Ed.), Groups, leadership and men(pp. 177‚Äì190). Pittsburgh, PA:Carnegie Press.Asch, S.E. (1952b). \\"Social psychology\\". Englewood Cliffs, NJ:Prentice Hall. Developed in the 1950s, the methodology remains in use by many researchers. Uses include the study of conformity effects of task importance, age, gender, and culture.  Initial conformity experiment   Method  One of the pairs of cards used in the experiment. The card on the left has the reference line and the one on the right shows the three comparison lines. In 1951, Solomon Asch conducted his first conformity laboratory experiments at Swarthmore College, laying the foundation for his remaining conformity studies. The experiment was published on two occasions.Asch, S. E. (1952a). Effects of group pressure on the modification and distortion of judgments. In G. E. Swanson, T. M. Newcomb & E. L. Hartley (Eds.), Readings in social psychology (2nd ed., pp. 2‚Äì11). New York: Holt. Groups of eight male college students participated in a simple \\"perceptual\\" task. In reality, all but one of the participants were actors, and the true focus of the study was about how the remaining participant would react to the actors' behavior. The actors knew the true aim of the experiment, but were introduced to the subject as other participants. Each student viewed a card with a line on it, followed by another with three lines labeled A, B, and C (see accompanying figure). One of these lines was the same as that on the first card, and the other two lines were clearly longer or shorter (i.e., a near-100% rate of correct responding was expected). Each participant was then asked to say aloud which line matched the length of that on the first card. Before the experiment, all actors were given detailed instructions on how they should respond to each trial (card presentation). They would always unanimously nominate one comparator, but on certain trials they would give the correct response and on others, an incorrect response. The group was seated such that the real participant always responded last. Subjects completed 18 trials. On the first two trials, both the subject and the actors gave the obvious, correct answer. On the third trial, the actors would all give the same wrong answer. This wrong-responding recurred on 11 of the remaining 15 trials. It was subjects' behavior on these 12 \\"critical trials\\" that formed the aim of the study: to test how many subjects would change their answer to conform to those of the 7 actors, despite it being wrong. Subjects were interviewed after the study including being debriefed about the true purpose of the study. These post-test interviews shed valuable light on the study: both because they revealed subjects often were \\"just going along\\" and because they revealed considerable individual differences to Asch. Additional trials with slightly altered conditions were also run, including having a single actor also give the correct answer. Asch's experiment also had a condition in which participants were tested alone with only the experimenter in the room. In total, there were 50 subjects in the experimental condition and 37 in the control condition.  Results  In the control group, with no pressure to conform to actors, the error rate on the critical stimuli was less than 1%. In the actor condition also, the majority of participants' responses remained correct (63.2%), but a sizable minority of responses conformed to the actors' (incorrect) answer (36.8 percent). The responses revealed strong individual differences: Only 5 percent of participants were always swayed by the crowd. 25 percent of the sample consistently defied majority opinion, with the rest conforming on some trials. An examination of all critical trials in the experimental group revealed that one-third of all responses were incorrect. These incorrect responses often matched the incorrect response of the majority group (i.e., actors). Overall, 75% of participants gave at least one incorrect answer out of the 12 critical trials. In his opinion regarding the study results, Asch put it this way: \\"That intelligent, well-meaning, young people are willing to call white black is a matter of concern.\\" = Interview responses = Participants' interview responses revealed a complex mixture of individual differences in subjects' reaction to the experimental situation, with distinct reactions linked to factors such as confidence, self-doubt, the desire to be normative, and resolving perceived confusion over the nature of the task. Asch's report included interviews of a subject that remained \\"independent\\" and another that \\"yielded.\\" Each provided a descriptive account following disclosure of the true nature of the experiment. The \\"independent\\" subject said that he felt happy and relieved and added, \\"I do not deny that at times I had the feeling: 'to go with it, I'll go along with the rest. (page 182)Asch, S.E. (1951). Effects of group pressure on the modification and distortion of judgments. In H. Guetzkow (Ed.), Groups, leadership and men(pp. 177‚Äì190). Pittsburgh, PA:Carnegie Press. At the other end of the spectrum, one \\"yielding\\" subject (who conformed in 11 of 12 critical trials) said, \\"I suspected about the middle ‚Äì but tried to push it out of my mind.\\" (page 182)Asch, S.E. (1951). Effects of group pressure on the modification and distortion of judgments. In H. Guetzkow (Ed.), Groups, leadership and men(pp. 177‚Äì190). Pittsburgh, PA:Carnegie Press. Asch points out that although the \\"yielding\\" subject was suspicious, he was not sufficiently confident to go against the majority. = Attitudes of independent responders = Subjects who did not conform to the majority reacted either with \\"confidence\\": they experienced conflict between their idea of the obvious answer and the group's incorrect answer, but stuck with their own answer, or were \\"withdrawn\\". These latter subjects stuck with their perception but did not experience conflict in doing so. Some participants also exhibited \\"doubt\\", responding in accordance with their perception, but questioning their own judgment while nonetheless sticking to their (correct) response, expressing this as needing to behave as they had been asked to do in the task. = Attitudes of responders conforming on one or more trials = Participants who conformed to the majority on at least 50% of trials reported reacting with what Asch called a \\"distortion of perception\\". These participants, who made up a distinct minority (only 12 subjects), expressed the belief that the actors' answers were correct, and were apparently unaware that the majority were giving incorrect answers. Among the other participants who yielded on some trials, most expressed what Asch termed \\"distortion of judgment\\". These participants concluded after a number of trials that they must be wrongly interpreting the stimuli and that the majority must be right, leading them to answer with the majority. These individuals were characterised by low levels of confidence. The final group of participants who yielded on at least some trials exhibited a \\"distortion of action\\". These subjects reported that they knew what the correct answer was, but conformed with the majority group simply because they didn't want to seem out of step by not going along with the rest.Asch, S.E. (1951). Effects of group pressure on the modification and distortion of judgments. In H. Guetzkow (Ed.), Groups, leadership and men(pp. 177‚Äì190). Pittsburgh, PA:Carnegie Press.  Variations on the original paradigm  An example of Asch's experimental procedure in 1955. There are six actors and one real participant (second to last person sitting to the right of the table). In subsequent research experiments, Asch explored several variations on the paradigm from his 1951 study. In 1955 he reported on work with 123 male students from three different universities. A second paper in 1956 also consisted of 123 male college students from three different universities,: Asch did not state if this was in fact the same sample as reported in his 1955 paper: The principal difference is that the 1956 paper includes an elaborate account of his interviews with participants. Across all these papers, Asch found the same results: participants conformed to the majority group in about one-third of all critical trials. ;Presence of a true partner :Asch found that the presence of a \\"true partner\\" (a \\"real\\" participant or another actor told to give the correct response to each question) decreased conformity. In studies that had one actor give correct responses to the questions, only 5% of the participants continued to answer with the majority. ;Withdrawal of a partner :Asch also examined whether the removal of a true partner partway through the experiment influenced participants' level of conformity. He found low levels of conformity during the first half of the experiment. However, once the partner left the room, the level of conformity increased dramatically. ;Majority size :Asch also examined whether decreasing or increasing the majority size had an influence on participants' level of conformity. It was discovered that very small-size opposing groups (actors) were associated with low levels of yielding. Increasing the opposing group to two or three persons increased conformity substantially. Increases beyond three persons (e.g., four, five, six, etc.) did not further-increase conformity. ;Written responses :Asch also varied method of participants' responding in studies where actors verbalized their responses aloud but the \\"real\\" participant responded in writing at the end of each trial. Conformity significantly decreased when shifting from public to written responses.  Interpretations   Normative influence vs. referent informational influence  The Asch conformity experiments are often interpreted as evidence for the power of conformity and normative social influence,Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S. D. & Wetherell, M. S. (1987). Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory. Oxford: BlackwellTurner, J. C. (1991). Social influence. Milton Keynes: Open University Press. where normative influence is the willingness to conform publicly to attain social reward and avoid social punishment. From this perspective, the results are viewed as a striking example of people publicly endorsing the group response despite knowing full well that they were endorsing an incorrect response. In contrast, John Turner and colleagues argue that the interpretation of the Asch conformity experiments as normative influence is inconsistent with the data. They point out that post-experiment interviews revealed that participants experienced uncertainty about their judgement during the experiments. Although the correct answer appeared obvious to the researchers, this was not necessarily the experience of participants. Subsequent research has demonstrated similar patterns of conformity where participants were anonymous and thus not subject to social punishment or reward on the basis of their responses. From this perspective, the Asch conformity experiments are viewed as evidence for the self-categorization theory account of social influence (otherwise known as the theory of referent informational influence).Haslam, A. S. (2001). Psychology in Organizations. London, SAGE Publications. Here, the observed conformity is an example of depersonalization processes, whereby people expect to hold the same opinions as others in their ingroup and will often adopt those opinions.  Social comparison theory  The conformity demonstrated in Asch experiments is problematic for social comparison theory. Social comparison theory suggests that, when seeking to validate opinions and abilities, people will first turn to direct observation. If direct observation is ineffective or not available, people will then turn to comparable others for validation. In other words, social comparison theory predicts that social reality testing will arise when physical reality testing yields uncertainty. The Asch conformity experiments demonstrate that uncertainty can arise as an outcome of social reality testing. More broadly, this inconsistency has been used to support the position that the theoretical distinction between social reality testing and physical reality testing is untenable.  Selective representation in textbooks and the media  Asch's 1956 report emphasized the predominance of independence over yielding saying \\"the facts that were being judged were, under the circumstances, the most decisive.\\" However, a 1990 survey of US social psychology textbooks found that most ignored independence, instead reported a misleading summary of the results as reflecting complete power of the situation to produce conformity of behavior and belief. A 2015 survey found no change, with just 1 of 20 major texts reporting that most participant-responses defied majority opinion. No text mentioned that 95% of subjects defied the majority at least once. Nineteen of the 20 books made no mention of Asch's interview data in which many participants said they were certain all along that the actors were wrong. This portrayal of the Asch studies was suggested to fit with social psychology narratives of situationism, obedience and conformity, to the neglect of recognition of disobedience of immoral commands (e.g. disobedience shown by participants in Milgram Studies), desire for fair treatment (e.g. resistance to tyranny shown by many participants in the Stanford prison studies) and self-determination.

Bartel was appointed Minister of Railways between 1919 and 1920, in 1922‚Äì1930 he was a member of Poland's Sejm. After J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's May Coup d'√©tat in 1926, he became prime minister and held this post during three broken tenures: 1926, 1928‚Äì29, 1929‚Äì1930. Bartel was the Deputy Prime Minister between 1926‚Äì1928 and Minister of Religious Beliefs and Public Enlightenment, when Pi≈Çsudski himself assumed the premiership, however, Bartel was in fact \\"de facto\\" prime minister during this period as Pi≈Çsudski did not concern himself with the day-to-day functions of the cabinet and the government. In 1930 upon giving up politics, he returned to the university as professor of mathematics. In 1930 he became rector of the Lw√≥w Polytechnic and was soon awarded an honorary doctorate and membership in the Polish Mathematical Association. In 1937 he was appointed a Senator of Poland and held this post until World War II. After the Soviet invasion and occupation of eastern Poland, he was allowed to continue lecturing at the Technical Institute. In 1940 he was summoned to Moscow and offered a seat in the Soviet parliament. On 30 June 1941, in the course of Operation Barbarossa, the German Wehrmacht entered Lw√≥w and began persecuting the local intelligentsia. Bartel was imprisoned two days later by the Gestapo and offered the top post in a Polish puppet government. His ultimate refusal of the German terms was taken as an act of treason by the Germans. By order of Heinrich Himmler, Bartel was murdered on 26 July 1941, shortly after the Massacre of Lw√≥w professors had ended. Early life and studies Kazimierz W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartel was born on 3 March 1882 in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary (later Poland, now Lviv in Ukraine) as the son of Micha≈Ç Bartel and Amalia Chadaczek. Growing up in a working-class family, he graduated from elementary school in Stryj. His railwayman father arranged Bartel to be an apprentice to fitter who taught in craft school. This allowed Bartel to continue his formal education while working as an apprentice.Kazimierz Bartel (1882‚Äì1941) by J. B. Deregowski After completing secondary school in 1901, Bartel studied mechanics at the Lw√≥w Polytechnic in the Mechanical Engineering Department. He graduated summa cum laude in 1907 and soon started working for his alma mater as an assistant in descriptive geometry to Placyd Zdzis≈Çaw Dziwinski.MacTutor biography From 1908 to 1909, he also studied mathematics and philosophy at the Franciscan University in Lviv and at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. The travel grant to Munich allowed him to attend the lectures on art history by Karl Dochlemann and mathematics by Aurel Voss and Alfred Pringsheim. He returned to the Polytechnic school and earned his doctor of technical sciences in 1909. His dissertation \\"O utworach szereg√≥w i pƒôk√≥w inwolucyjnych\\" (Compositions series and involution pencils) allowed him to become one of the first title holders of such doctoral within Austria-Hungary. Bartel gave his habilitation thesis \\"O p≈Çaskich utworach inwolucji stopnia czwartego szeregu zerowego\\" (On planar products of involution of the fourth series of the zero degree) in 1912,The growth of mathematical culture in the Lvov area in the autonomy period (1870‚Äì1920) then received the title of associate professor. Bartel became the chair of descriptive geometry after the retirement of Mieczys≈Çaw ≈Åazarski in 1911 due to blindness.Biographical entry of Mieczys≈Çaw ≈Åazarski (in Polish) Bartel attained the title of professor of mathematics at the Lw√≥w Polytechnic in 1917. Conscripted into the Austro- Hungarian army during World War I, after the collapse of the empire in 1918 he returned to Lw√≥w, which became part of the newly established Second Polish Republic. In 1919, as commander of railway troops, he fought in the defence of the city against the Ukrainian siege. During this period, Bartel wrote his first textbook on descriptive geometry and befriended and later supported Poland's future leader, marshal and commander-in-chief, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. Since May 1919 he served as the manager of the Armoured Trains Construction Management and Association. His numerous successes in this field led to Prime Minister Leopold Skulski appointing him the Minister of the Railway system of the Republic of Poland. During this time Bartel met other significant and influential politicians and diplomats, most notably Prime Minister Wincenty Witos and Prime Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Grabski. Following the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War of 1920, Bartel was nominated as a lieutenant colonel and was left in charge of the railway reserve officers and the Lw√≥w militia. He was awarded a Virtuti Militari cross, a Polish distinction for valor, after the armed conflict. Im 1921, Bartel spent six months travelling to museums and galleries in France, Italy, Switzerland and Austria to research on art. Most of his holidays were spent likewise due to his interest stemming from Dochlemann's lectures. He accumulated a good personal archive of notes and photographs for this interest of his. Political and diplomatic career In 1922 Bartel was elected a member of Poland's Sejm (parliament) and held this position until 1929. Initially, he was a member of the party PSL \\"Liberation\\", but he was not satisfied with the radicalization of the group. In March 1925 at the Congress of the Polish People's Party he decided to adopt, among others, a reform without compensation. Bartel eventually left the party and the organisation in April 1925, along with Marian Zyndram-Ko≈õcia≈Çkowski and Boles≈Çaw Wys≈Çouch and later founded the parliamentary \\"Labour Club\\". This organization quickly came under the direct influence of commander-in-chief J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. Just before the May Coup of 1926 Kazimierz Bartel received an order from Marshal Pi≈Çsudski to prepare for a take over as prime minister after the expected collapse of President Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski and his government. First term in office, first government (1926) On 15 May 1926, after the resignation of the government led by Wincenty Witos and president Wojciechowski following the May Coup, Bartel was appointed by Marshal of the Sejm and the acting head of state Maciej Rataj as the prime minister of the Second Polish Republic, although, Bartel later stated in his inauguration speech that he would only be the head of government until the election of a new president. His decision was possibly influenced by the fact that he suffered from kidney and stomach problems and was constantly in pain. One member of the parliament stated that \\"He was a cheerful and ambitious man, but always in pain. Even his opponents in the Sejm admitted that in personal relationships, it is extremely hard not to be in favour of a man like Bartel. As prime minister, he tried to aid every man possible, even the men and women that opposed his policies and the government, but he was not able to help himself, which led to his early decline in politics and diplomacy of the Polish Republic. He was of weak stature and of weak health and would hardly make a good impression on the public, especially the socialists or communists in the east and therefore, this would not make him an influential Prime Minister nor a diplomat supporting democracy.\\" Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel, 1928 Bartel's new government consisted mostly of people not connected with any political parties (four of those politicians already were occupied ministerial positions). Bartel was described as ideologically centrist ‚Äì Prime Minister's newly established office was occupied by both the right-wing leaders and left. Bartel himself took over the Ministry in turn, and Pi≈Çsudski the Minister of War. Such a system churned mainly the Polish Socialist Party, which supported the May Coup. On 16 May 1926, Prime Minister Bartel made a statement in which he highlighted the principles of his policies. Bartel stated that the cabinet took power in accordance with the law, without any prejudice to the constitutional order. He also called for peace, hard work and dedication to the Polish nation. At the same time he promised the immediate removal of incompetent and corrupt politicians from any high posts that could negatively influence the future economic growth of the Second Polish Republic. Bartel's closest personal advisor in politics and diplomacy was Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, who was in favour of the new minister. Bartel suggested that Ignacy Mo≈õcicki should become a candidate for the post of head of state (president), who was also a professor at the Lw√≥w Polytechnic. Bartel's first government was one of the most active in the history of Poland; the politicians and members of parliament gathered every second day and on occasions everyday to discuss political matters. On 4 June 1926 Ignacy Mo≈õcicki was elected the president of the Second Polish Republic and subsequently Bartel resigned along with the entire cabinet, however, soon after being appointed President Mo≈õcicki designated him again to become Prime Minister. Second and third government (1926) On 8 June 1926 ‚Äì three days after the Mo≈õcicki's designation ‚Äì Bartel formed his second cabinet. On the same day J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski sent a letter to the head office, in which he outlined the conditions re-entry to the parliament. Following his second election, Kazimierz Bartel primarily focused on the restoration of the decree based on the organization of the highest military authorities from 7 January 1921, which enables the free management of the Ministry of War without the vote of the government and the parliament. On 9 June 1926 the decree was officially restored, however, another decree was adopted, which increased the power of the president or head of state over the ministry. Bartel met with representatives of the parliamentary clubs, highlighting, in a conversation with them, his commitment towards the parliamentary system, but also pointed out a more concerning issue ‚Äì the economic development of the country. At a private meeting with senators he highlighted his determination and involvement in fighting against bureaucracy, the introduction of apolitical army and the elimination of the Ministry of Public Works. He vividly stated that before the May Coup there was no democracy and Poland was ruled by oligarchy, nobles and influential leaders of wealthy, privately owned clubs and parties. The supporters of Kazimierz Bartel and his government emphasized his efficiency when managing the state. His opponents, however, saw it as a tool to limit the role of the Polish Parliament and accused him of deliberate dictatorship and control over the ministers in his \\"private parliament sittings\\" - the so-called Sejm Bartlowy (Bartel's Parliament). Bartel was appointed prime minister when Marshal Pi≈Çsudski undertook an attempt to communicate with the rebellious senators and members of the Sejm. Bartel himself was considered to be representative of the liberal tendencies in the party and a spokesman of the Sanacja movement. Otherwise the post of the head of government (Prime Minister) was either taken by Kazimierz ≈öwitalski or Walery S≈Çawek, both considered to be uncompromising supporters of the conflict with the parliament. Bartel's government contributed to a marked improvement in administration. This was primarily caused by the Prime Minister's organizational skills and knowledge. He was able to create an efficient system of government action in connection with the Sejm and officials of lower rank: \\"The ministers of the previous governments generally considered themselves as autonomous rulers, which influenced the private interests of the members of different parties in charge. The government of Kazimierz Bartel was never focused or concentrated on any political ties and friendships. The officials of the Prime Minister were to validate the efficiency of each ministry. Each minister was responsible for the operation of his office and ministers could not engage in any political activities. Before his speech in the parliament of any topic, he had to submit the text to the Prime Minister himself for approval. Bartel demanded such procedures from every minister and senator of his cabinet and personally prepared the agenda for each meeting of the government and disallowed to discuss any topic without his permission or consent.\\" Bartel also tried to improve the situation of the Polish Jews and the Jewish minority around the country. He was determined to eliminate the remnants of regulations dating back to the times of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Congress Poland, focused on the persecution of religious minorities, especially the Jews and the Gypsies. Bartel's cabinet announced that it is against such inhumane procedures and actions, and in 1927 the Prime Minister gave permission to adopt a law officially recognizing and granting rights to the Jewish communities. Bartel was also against enforcing certain laws to the nature of the economic sanctions imposed on the Jews. Bartel (right) with Marshal of the Sejm Ignacy Daszy≈Ñski, 1929 On 2 August 1926 the Parliament adopted an amendment to the Constitution (the so-called \\"August Novella\\"), significantly strengthening the role of the president. On 20 September 1926 the Christian Democratic Party raised a vote against two ministers in the government of Kazimierz Bartel ‚Äì Antoni Sujkowski and Kazimierz M≈Çodzianowski. The party accused them of carrying out political purges in the state administration. Eventually the vote was passed by the government; this forced Bartel and his cabinet to resign, however, Marshal Pi≈Çsudski ordered President Mo≈õcicki to appoint Bartel as Prime Minister once more as this was not in violation of the Constitution, but the anti-parliamentarian speakers and the socialist politicians, confused with the often changes in the administration and within the government, threatened the Sejm and even suggested a rebellion or another coup. Due to this conflict Bartel's third new cabinet only lasted four days. On 30 September at the Belvedere palace in Warsaw, the council was holding a meeting in the study room, during which it was decided to dissolve the third government. Therefore, Bartel received the document on this subject, which for its validity required President Mo≈õcicki's signature. Meanwhile, the Senate immediately demanded that the parliament passes the budget cut policy proposed by the Upper House. Bartel told the Speaker of the Sejm Maciej Rataj, that in such situation he will personally take the decree to Mo≈õcicki and ask for his signature. After the Sejm passed the budget cut policy, Bartel arrived at Mo≈õcicki's private residence, but to his surprise, Mo≈õcicki refused to sign the document allowing the dissolution. Instead he ordered Bartel to terminate his employment. Bartel was once again forced to resign, but this time his cabinet would stay intact and his place would be taken by the marshal himself. The former prime minister was very bitter about this turn of events, despite the fact he went along with Pi≈Çsudski's and Rataj's plans. In its course the Marshal warned that, in contrast to the previous government, he will not be \\"competing\\" with the ministers and if necessary he will use force if the members would not agree to his radical policies. Collaboration with Pi≈Çsudski's Council Following his resignation, Bartel was to become the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Enlightenment in Pi≈Çsudski's own, private council that operated in case of any unexpected conflict with the current operating government. The Marshal did not devote much attention towards his cabinet, focusing primarily on military and foreign policies. It was Kazimierz Bartel that was to replace the Marshal and take over his duties if absent and become the Speaker of the Sejm. He often spoke, as a representative of the government, on matters related to the budget and finances. These topics were the possibly the main subject of a dispute between the \\"Pi≈Çsudskites\\" and the parliamentary opposition. After the elections in March 1928, Pi≈Çsudski decided that Kazimierz Bartel should be appointed to the position of Speaker of the Sejm. On 27 March the \\"Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government\\" (BBWR), an ostensibly non-political organization that existed from 1928 to 1935, closely affiliated with J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and his Sanacja movement, declared Bartel's candidacy. However Pi≈Çsudski's plan to place Bartel in charge of the Sejm and nominate him as Marshal Speaker failed, because the senators and members of parliament decided to choose Ignacy Daszy≈Ñski of the Polish Socialist Party as the Marshal of the Sejm instead. In protest, following the results of the vote, the members and supporters of the parliamentary BBWR party left the room. The year 1928 also marked the release of his first book \\"Perspektywa Malarska\\". It dealt with the basic theory of perspective and its extension to architecture and art. It was published by Ksiaznica-Atlas, a publisher in Lw√≥w who provided the negatives for the German translation published by B.G. Teubner in 1934. Second term in office (1928‚Äì1929) As soon as the new government was formed without Kazimierz Bartel as its head, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, temporarily serving as Prime Minister of the country, resigned. He decided, however, that his position will be taken over by Kazimierz Bartel, considered his most trusted and most loyal friend and supporter among the members of the party, although this change was only formal ‚Äì Bartel was already responsible for leading the ongoing work of the Council of Ministers, even if he was not the Head of Cabinet. Pi≈Çsudski's decision greatly dissatisfied the senators of parliament, who would simply demonstrate their anger by not participating in the sessions and sittings of the Sejm. Some politicians dared to even throw rotten food at the ministers that were leaving the voting chamber. The situation worsened in the upcoming months and some ministers raised concerns about their safety, as some demonstrators, often made up of ordinary citizens working on the behalf of the party, tended to physically abuse officials travelling from their homes to the newly constructed government building located on Wiejska Street in Warsaw. Similar events occurred during the inauguration of the first President of the Second Polish Republic, Gabriel Narutowicz, in December 1922. The politicians and ministers were advised to travel with guards, police or at least a weapon that they could defend themselves with, however, the use of weapons may have strengthened the unity of the opposition and of the demonstrators that could use this as an act of violence against the common people and a violation of social democracy. After the beginning of the so-called \\"Czechowicz affair\\", where the opposition discovered that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gabriel Czechowicz, a strong admirer of Pi≈Çsudski, passed 8 million Polish z≈Çoty from the state budget for the BBWR campaign between 1927 and 1928, on 12 February 1929 the members of an anti-Sanacja movement have requested to place both Czechowicz and Bartel before the State Tribunal (Court). In protest against this decision, Kazimierz Bartel informed the press of his intention to resign. He also stated that in his opinion the Czechowicz affair was caused by the Parliament and its senators rather than by the doings of one politician. On 13 April 1929 Bartel ordered his government to resign. He was replaced by Kazimierz ≈öwitalski, a stubborn and self-centred man considered to be the cause of relentless struggle with the parliamentary opposition. The following months were marked by disputes between the newly formed government and the Sejm. Bartel's new cabinet began operating 5 November 1929, however, its first sitting occurred in December on the orders of President Mo≈õcicki. After this, the Parliament adopted a motion of no confidence against ≈öwitalski's Cabinet. Kazimierz Bartel became the Prime Minister once again. Third term in office (1929‚Äì1930) Bartel's fifth cabinet, December 1929. In center: J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and Ignacy Mo≈õcicki. On 29 December 1929 Kazimierz Bartel was chosen for the third time to be Prime Minister and formed his fifth government and cabinet, however, he performed his duties with large uncertainties, mainly due to poor health. He had kidney illness and had a ureterolithotomy with help from Tadeusz Pisarski, a urologist he befriended during their conscription in the army.The beginnings of urology in Krak√≥w: on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Clinic of Urology He also suffered from depression and anxiety probably due to the constant disputes with the Sejm and its senators. On 10 January he appeared at a meeting with members of parliament, declaring his willingness to cooperate with the senators and the Sejm, saying \\"I come with good will and determination gentlemen!\\" Bartel initially managed to establish a cooperation with the Sejm, which resulted in the stabilization of the entire situation and conflict. Later, however, the relations between the cabinet and the parliament deteriorated again. The apogee of another dispute was a request for the adoption of no-confidence motion against Minister of Labour and Social Welfare Aleksander Prystor. This was done primarily through the initiative of the Polish Socialist Party headed by Ignacy Daszy≈Ñski and his supporters like Boles≈Çaw Limanowski, a Polish socialist politician, as well as historian and journalist and advocate of Agrarianism, who was the oldest member of the Polish Senate until his death in 1935 at the age of 99. On 12 March Bartel gave a speech in the Senate sharply attacking the senators, which, in his opinion were \\"not able to fulfill the tasks set in order to control the state and the country and that their stubbornness and pride in themselves was an astonishing blow to both the economy and the policies of Poland.\\" He also stated that \\"being a member of parliament is a profession. It does not require the members to acquire any skills and create new damaging campaigns, only to obey the ruling party. A man focused only on work and career often becomes a man in conflict with others, which entails long political consequences.\\" Bartel believed that the motion of no confidence towards one member of the Senate is the lack of support of the entire government. On 15 March 1930 he decided to leave the office and his resignation was accepted by the president the next day. Soon after he also resigned from his parliamentary seat and left politics. Walery S≈Çawek was appointed the new Prime Minister of Poland. Post-candidacy and return to the university After retiring from political life, he returned to the Technical University of Lw√≥w (Polytechnic). In the same year he was elected rector of the university and held that office in the academic year of 1930/1931. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate and membership of the Polish Academy of Sciences: in the years 1930-1932 he was president of the Polish Mathematical Society. During this time he published his most important works, including a series of lectures on the perspective of European painting. It was the first such publication in the world. During his work at the Technical University of Lw√≥w, he expressed strong opposition to plans focused on introducing the so-called \\"ghetto benches\\" for students of Jewish origin and ethnicity to separate them from Polish and Christian peers. His opinions, as well as other actions against anti-Semitic students made Kazimierz Bartel the subject of numerous attacks including throwing eggs and rotten food at the professor or bringing a pig with the sign \\"Bartel\\" by Polish nationalists to the university grounds. In 1932, he testified as a witness in the Brest trials, lasting from 26 October 1931 to 13 January 1932, held at the Warsaw Regional Court where leaders of the Centrolew, a \\"Centre- Left\\" anti-Sanacja-government political-opposition movement, were tried. In 1937 Bartel was appointed Senator of Poland by the President (replacing the deceased Emil Bobrowski) and served until the outbreak of World War II. In the autumn of 1938 he was one of the signatories of a document addressed to the President Mo≈õcicki, which called for the inclusion of representatives of the opposition to the government in connection with the threat of the country's independence. This document also postulated amnesty for politicians of the opposition, who were forced into exile or were imprisoned after the Brest trials. Bartel handed over a memorandum to Mo≈õcicki, however, Mo≈õcicki did not respond to the proposals contained therein. In February 1939 Bartel delivered a speech in the Senate, which has gained wide publicity in the country. In it he sharply criticized the situation in universities and colleges around Poland, mentioning the widespread anti-Semitism there, and also the failed organization of studies, subjects and courses. World War II Bartel, 1928 In September 1939, during the defense of Lw√≥w just before the attack of the German troops, Kazimierz Bartel served as the head of the Civic Committee. When Lw√≥w became occupied by the Soviet Union he was allowed to continue his lectures at the Technical University. In July 1940 he was, along with several other politicians and professors, summoned to Moscow, where he took part in an All-Committee meeting of Universities of the USSR. Conversations and topics mentioned mostly related scientific issues ‚Äì Bartel signed a contract with a publishing house to write a textbook of Science and Geometry for the schools of the Soviet Union. He also visited the scientific and cultural institutions like the Tretyakov Gallery and the Institute of Architecture in Moscow. There are some conflicting reports about whether during his stay in Moscow, the Soviets offered him political cooperation. According to some of his closest friends, Stalin issued a proposal for the creation of a new Polish government, but Bartel rejected it. As he wrote to his wife on 16 July 1941: \\"By listening to private conversations of the officers, I conclude that my position as Prime Minister may be resurrected, but what great duty this will be to control a split, communist country. In Moscow with Joseph Stalin, I had the pleasure of finding out new information from the West - Winston Churchill's speech addressed to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski about Poland's supposed future.\\" One of the editions of \\"Paris' Historical Notebooks\\" described the content of the letter sent to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It stated that M√ºller, the Deputy Head of the Security Police and Security Service (Reinhard Heydrich) believed that Bartel negotiated at the beginning of 1941 with the Soviet authorities about the establishment of a new nation that together with the Soviet Union was to declare war on Nazi Germany. Similar information can be found, among others, in a telegram sent by the Polish Charg√© d'Affaires in Switzerland to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London dating from 26 September 1940: \\"It's believed that Moscow professor Bartel has intention to create the Red Government of Poland.\\" This information, however, was never proved to be true. Meanwhile, Maria Bartlowa, the wife of former Prime Minister, stated that her husband was talking only with the Soviets on the release of his new lecture book. It is also widely believed that Kazimierz Bartel never met Stalin in person. The Prime Minister-in-exile stationing in London, General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, had plans to cooperate with Kazimierz Bartel and appoint him ambassador. Sikorski recognized him as one of the few people from the former political circles, that would agree to cooperate on the terms and conditions of the British government. On 19 June 1941 Bartel's candidacy was officially reported by Sikorski during a meeting of the Council of Ministers. The decision was motivated by the political loyalty of the former Prime Minister, as well as his successful efforts to preserve the Polish character of the Lw√≥w Polytechnic under Soviet occupation. Sikorski, however, failed to find Bartel in the USSR and Stanis≈Çaw Kot was appointed ambassador instead. Arrest and death On 30 June 1941, soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht entered Lw√≥w. Bartel was arrested on 2 July while being in a meeting with co-workers at the University. Thirty-six other colleagues in the faculty were arrested the next night. Bartel was taken initially to a Gestapo prison on Pelczy≈Ñska street. There, as mentioned by inmate Antoni Stefanowicz, he was treated properly. The former Prime Minister was allowed to receive and send letters and mathematical books and papers to his wife and to bring food from home. At that time, Bartel was not questioned, because there were some issues regarding the accusations made by the Gestapo. On 21 July, however, he was transferred to a prison at ≈ÅƒÖckiego Street, where he was treated poorly; the guards called him a Commie- Jew, as reported by Stefanowicz, and the Nazi officials ordered Bartel to clean the boots of a Ukrainian Hilfsgestapo soldier. Stefanowicz reported that Bartel was mentally devastated and could not understand the essence of this tragedy. According to some sources, the Nazi officials proposed the establishment of a Polish puppet government dependent on the Reich. Such information was given by General Sikorski during a press conference in Cairo in November 1941 (on the way to Moscow). According to his version, Bartel refused, and on the orders of Heinrich Himmler was executed on 26 July 1941 at dawn. He was shot probably near Piaski Janowskie in the context of the Massacre of Lw√≥w professors. Being barred from her daily delivery of food to her husband on the Saturday of 26 June, Bartel's wife learned of Bartel's shooting death the next Monday. According to one account, during the night of October 1943 the Sonderkommando composed of Jewish prisoners unearthed the bodies of the murdered Polish professors that were filed in a mass grave. This was carried out in order to remove the traces of the murder, in connection with the approaching Soviet troops. On 9 October 1943 the corpses were piled. The prisoners were forced to take any personal belongings and clothes, including documents of Kazimierz Bartel and Professor Tadeusz Ostrowski. Later the pile of corpses was set on fire and in the following days the Sonderkommando scattered the ashes on the surrounding fields. In 1966, on the 25th anniversary of the execution of Lw√≥w professors, a plaque with the names of the victims of Nazism was placed on the church of St. Francis of Assisi in Krak√≥w. Next to memorial there is also a separate epitaph in honor of Kazimierz Bartel. After death Knowing the importance Bartel gave to his work on perspective, his wife was able to save his manuscript after his death by begging from the Nazi officials. Bartel's library of books were either shipped with some pieces of furniture to Germany or burned with his personal papers. His second book was supposed to be published first in German by B. G. Teubner, who would provide Ksiaznica-Atlas the negatives for the Polish edition. However, war delayed the printing and ultimately caused the destruction of all materials. In the 1950s, The second book was reconstructed in the 1950s by Professor F. Otto of the University of Gdansk using the surviving manuscript and the printer's proofs which Teubner had sent for Bartel's approval. The second book dealt with analyzing pictures geometrically, artistic reconstruction of geometry exhibited in pictures, and tracing art history using tenets of his theory of perspective. A uniform series was released by Polskie Wydawnictwo Naukowe, the second book in 1958 and the first volume in 1960. Honours and awards He was decorated with, among others, the Order of the White Eagle (1932) for outstanding achievements, the French Legion of Honour (class I), the Cross of Valour, the Cross of Independence and the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari (1922).

Ibn al-Nadim lists nearly 140 titles attributed to Al- Jahiz, of which 75 are extant. The best known are KitƒÅb al-¬≠·∏§ayawƒÅn (The book of living), a seven-part compendium on an array of subjects with animals as their point of departure; KitƒÅb al-BayƒÅn wa-l-tabyƒ´n (The book of eloquence and exposition), a wide-ranging work on human communication; and KitƒÅb al- BukhalƒÅ æ (The book of misers), a collection of anecdotes on stinginess.

Born in Basra early in 160/February 776, he asserted in a book he wrote that he was a member of the Arabian tribe Banu Kinanah.Al- Jahiz messages, Alwarraq edition, page 188; YƒÅq≈´t, IrshƒÅd al-arƒ´b il√° ma\`rifat al-adƒ´b, ed.

He sold fish along one of the canals in Basra to help his family. Financial difficulties, however, did not stop al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì from continuously seeking knowledge. He used to gather with a group of other youths at Basra's main mosque, where they would discuss different scientific subjects. During the cultural and intellectual revolution under the Abbasid Caliphate books became readily available, and learning accessible. Al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì studied philology, lexicography and poetry from among the most learned scholars at the School of Basra, where he attended the lectures of Ab≈´ Ubaydah, Al-A·π£ma‚Äôƒ´, Sa'ƒ´d ibn Aws al-An·π£ƒÅrƒ´ and studied ilm an-na·∏•w (, i.e., syntax) with al-Akhfash Abƒ´ al-·∏§asan. Over a twenty-five-year span studying, al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì acquired a considerable knowledge of Arabic poetry, Arabic philology, pre-Islamic Arab history, the Qur'an and the Hadiths. He read translated books on Greek sciences and Hellenistic philosophy, especially that of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Al-Jahiz, was also critical of those who followed oral Hadiths, referring to his Hadithist opponents as al-nabita (\\"the contemptible\\"). Career A giraffe from KitƒÅb al-HayawƒÅn (Book of the Animals) by al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì. While still in Basra, al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì wrote an article about the institution of the Caliphate. This is said to have been the beginning of his career as a writer, which would become his sole source of living. It is said that his mother once offered him a tray full of notebooks and told him he would earn his living from writing. He went on to write two hundred books in his lifetime on a variety of subjects, including on the Quran, Arabic grammar, zoology, poetry, lexicography, and rhetoric. Of his writings, only thirty books survive. Al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì was also one of the first Arabic writers to suggest a complete overhaul of the language's grammatical system, though this would not be undertaken until his fellow linguist Ibn Ma·∏çƒÅ æ took up the matter two hundred years later.Shawqi Daif, Introduction to Ibn Mada's Refutation of the Grammarians, pg. 48.

Al-Nadƒ´m cited this passage from a book of al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì: > ‚ÄúWhen I was writing these two books, about the creation of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn, which > was the tenet given importance and honour by the Commander of the Faithful, > and another about superiority in connection with the Ban≈´ HƒÅshim, the ‚ÄòAbd > Shams, and Makhz≈´m. what was my due but to sit above the SimakƒÅn, Spica and > Arcturus, or on top of the ‚ÄòAyy≈´q, or to deal with red sulphur, or to > conduct the ‚ÄòAnqƒÅ by her leading string to the Greatest King. Al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì moved to Baghdad, then the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, in 816 AD, because the caliphs encouraged scientists and scholars and had just founded the library of the Bayt al-·∏§ikmah. But al-Nadim suspected a claim by al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì that the caliph al-Ma‚Äôm≈´n had praised his books on the imamate and the caliphate, for his eloquent phraseology, and use of market-place speech, and that of the elite and of the kings, was exaggerated self-glorification and doubted al-Ma‚Äôm≈´n could have spoken these words. Al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì was said to have admired the eloquent literary style of the director of the library, Sahl ibn HƒÅr≈´n (d. 859/860) and quoted his works. Because of the caliphs' patronage and his eagerness to establish himself and reach a wider audience, al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì stayed in Baghdad. Al-Nadƒ´m gives two versions of an anecdote which differ in their source: his first source is Ab≈´ HiffƒÅn and his second is the grammarian al- Mubarrad, and retells the story of al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì's reputation for being one of the three great bibliophiles and scholarsthe two others being al-Fat·∏• ibn KhƒÅqƒÅn and judge IsmƒÅ‚Äôƒ´l ibn Is·∏•ƒÅq such that ‚Äúwhenever a book came into the hand of al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì he read through it, wherever he happened to be. He even used to rent the shops of al-warrƒÅq≈´n for study.‚Äù Al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì replaced IbrƒÅhƒ´m ibn al-‚ÄòAbbƒÅs al-·π¢≈´lƒ´ in the government secretariat of al-Ma‚Äôm≈´n but left after just three days. Later at Samarra) he wrote a huge number of his books. The caliph al- Ma'mun wanted al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì to teach his children, but then changed his mind when his children were frightened by al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì's boggle-eyes (). This is said to be the origin of his nickname. He enjoyed the patronage of al-Fath ibn Khaqan, the bibliophile boon companion of Caliph al-Mutawakkil, but after his murder in December 861 he left Samarra for his native Basra, where he lived on his estate with his ‚Äúconcubine, her maid, a manservant, and a donkey.‚Äù He died there in late 868, according to one story, when a pile of books from his private library collapsed on him.  Foreshadowing of Evolution  Al-Jahiz writes in Kitab al-Hayawan (IV,68) \\"Lice are black on the head of a young man with black hair, light on that of a hoary old man.\\" This is most clear example of micro-evolution. Al-Jahiz furthermore describes the struggle for existence and natural selection.

KitƒÅb al-·∏§ayawƒÅn () ‚ÄòBook of the Animals‚Äô KitƒÅb al-·∏§ayawƒÅn is an encyclopedia in seven volumes of anecdotes, poetic descriptions and proverbs describing over 350 Species of animals. Composed in honour of Mu·∏•ammad ibn ‚ÄòAbd al-MƒÅlik al-ZayyƒÅt, who paid him five thousand gold coins (5., dƒ´nƒÅr). The 11th-century scholar Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi dismissed it as \\"little more than a plagiarism\\" of Aristotle's KitƒÅb al-HayawƒÅna charge of plagiarism was levelled against Aristotle himself with regard to a certain \\"Asclepiades of Pergamum\\". Later scholars have noted that there was only a limited Aristotelian influence in al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì's work, and that al-Baghdadi may have been unacquainted with Aristotle's work. Conway Zirkle, writing about the history of natural selection science in 1941, said that an excerpt from this work was the only relevant passage he had found from an Arabian scholar. He provided a quotation describing the struggle for existence, citing a Spanish translation of this work: > The rat goes out for its food, and is clever in getting it, for it eats all > animals inferior to it in strength\\", and in turn, it \\"has to avoid snakes > and birds and serpents of prey, who look for it in order to devour it\\" and > are stronger than the rat. Mosquitos \\"know instinctively that blood is the > thing which makes them live\\" and when they see an animal, \\"they know that > the skin has been fashioned to serve them as food\\". In turn, flies hunt the > mosquito \\"which is the food that they like best\\", and predators eat the > flies. \\"All animals, in short, can not exist without food, neither can the > hunting animal escape being hunted in his turn. Every weak animal devours > those weaker than itself. Strong animals cannot escape being devoured by > other animals stronger than they. And in this respect, men do not differ > from animals, some with respect to others, although they do not arrive at > the same extremes. In short, God has disposed some human beings as a cause > of life for others, and likewise, he has disposed the latter as a cause of > the death of the former.\\" KitƒÅb al-BukhalƒÅ‚Äô () ‚ÄòThe Book of Misers‚Äô also (Avarice and the Avaricious) A collection of stories about the greedy. Humorous and satirical, it is the best example of al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì' prose style. Al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì ridicules schoolmasters, beggars, singers and scribes for their greedy behavior. Many of the stories continue to be reprinted in magazines throughout the Arabic- speaking world. The book is considered one of the best works of al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì.

Though he was neither a poet nor a philologist in the proper sense ‚Äì al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì took a keen interest in almost any imaginable subject ‚Äì the book is considered to have started Arabic literary theory in a formal, systemic fashion.G.

Al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì's defining of eloquence as the ability of the speaker to deliver an effective message while maintaining it as brief or elaborate at will was widely accepted by later Arabic literary critics.G.J. van Gelder, \\"Brevity in Classical Arabic Literary Theory.\\" Taken from Proceedings of the Ninth Congress of the Union Europ√©enne Des Arabisants et Islamisants: Amsterdam, 1 to 7 September 1978, pg. 81.

Owned by Brookfield Retail Group, Ala Moana is the ninth largest shopping mall in the United States and the largest open-air shopping center in the world. Ala Moana is consistently ranked among the most successful malls in the world. With assets totaling $5.74 billion as of January 2018, it is the most valuable shopping mall in the United States. History Before the construction of the mall, the land was a swamp. Dredging projects nearby spearheaded by Walter F. Dillingham created excess coral which filled the swamp, purchased by Dillingham in 1912 from the estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop. Land reclaimed, son and successor Lowell Dillingham initiated the Ala Moana Center project in 1948 and broke ground in 1957. Initial development and design The Ala Moana Center was developed and designed by Don Graham. Critics viewed Graham's unusual design, which oriented the mall away from the Pacific Ocean and included two levels for retail and parking, as a potential failure. However, the Ala Moana Center proved a success after its opening, and helped refocus the retail center of Oahu away from downtown Honolulu. Graham worked as the center's first general manager after its opening. Opening When it opened in 1959, Ala Moana Center became the largest shopping mall in the United States. Brookfield Properties Retail Group of Chicago currently owns and operates Ala Moana Center. Although later retail developments across the nation have overshadowed it over the years, General Growth Properties markets and lists Ala Moana Center as the world's largest open-air mall with a total retail space of . Its original tenants included Sears, Roebuck and Company, F. W. Woolworth Company, Foodland, Longs Drugs, and Shirokiya, among other local shops. Ala Moana Center's second-phase expansion included the 1961 addition of the Ala Moana Office Building (including La Ronde, the first revolving restaurant in the United States), the 1966 addition of JCPenney and Liberty House in a new Diamond Head wing. In 1982, Ala Moana Center was purchased by a partnership of Japanese corporation, Daiei, and an insurance company. In 1995, Daiei became the sole owner. Once a management vendor for Daiei, General Growth Properties purchased Ala Moana Center in 1999. Addition of Makai Market food court The Makai Market food court was built in 1987. A 1999 expansion created a berth for Neiman Marcus and created more upper-level retail spaces. A shopping complex and parking spaces were demolished just north of the shopping mall in 2006 to make way for the Mauka wing, which was completed on March 7, 2008 and was anchored by Nordstrom. Success and expansion Neiman Marcus store at Ala Moana Center In a June 26, 2009, report from U.S. News & World Report, Ala Moana was ranked as the second most profitable mall in America based on sales per square footage, and also had one of the highest occupancy rates, at 95%. The report described the flourishing mall as a gold mine, with annual sales of more than $1 billion. In the early 2000s, the mall underwent extensive renovation and expansion, transforming it into the modern and world-class shopping destination it has become today. During this period the mall added two new wings: a Makai wing to the south anchored by Neiman Marcus, and a Mauka wing to the north headlined by Nordstrom. Departure of Sears On February 23, 2012, Sears Holdings Corporation announced it would close its store at Ala Moana Center by early 2013. Sears held its original location and had a presence at the mall since its opening in 1959. The closing was part of a $270 million sale of 11 Sears properties nationwide. The Wall Street Journal estimated that the Ala Moana Sears location was the largest portion of the deal, comprising between $200 million to $250 million of the overall sale price. The Ala Moana location closed permanently at 7 PM on June 2, 2013. Ewa Wing expansion On May 17, 2013, the owner of Ala Moana Center announced that Bloomingdale's would anchor and occupy of a new and expanded Ewa wing. The expanded wing opened on November 12, 2015, replacing the existing wing on the western end of the mall, including the space previously occupied by Sears. The new wing included Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom, which relocated from the north end of the mall, as anchors. On October 22, 2017, Target held its grand opening for its first store at a mall in Hawaii in the space formerly occupied by Nordstrom. Architecture and layout Central promenade of Ala Moana Center Costing US$25 million in 1959, Ala Moana Center had eighty-seven stores and four thousand parking spaces. Ala Moana Center was remodeled extensively in various phases. New designs reflected modern Hawaiian architectural principles, emphasizing the importance of the symbolism of various natural phenomena found in Hawaii. Asian Pacific Rim motifs have been adopted reflecting the large Asian population of residents in Hawaii. For decades, a centerpiece of Ala Moana Center was its koi ponds. In the Japanese culture, koi represents happiness and tranquility. Despite these enhancements, the design of the Center has been criticized for its over-built appearance and hodge-podge architecture, the result of years of modifications and expansions under different owners. Still, Ala Moana Center architecture and layouts inspired its owner in 2004 to invest over US$1 billion in remodeling various other shopping centers across Canada and the United States, using Ala Moana Center as a template. As of 2018, Ala Moana is valued at nearly $6 billion and is the largest outdoor mall in the world. Ala Moana Centerstage is one of the most popular public amphitheaters in Hawaii. On a stage in the center of the shopping complex, local talents are showcased for visitors to enjoy. Hula dances are a staple for Ala Moana Centerstage as well as performances by the Royal Hawaiian Band, the oldest municipal band in the United States. Schools throughout the country, as well as the world, travel to Honolulu just to be able to perform at Ala Moana Centerstage. In addition, episodes of the local TV show Hawaii Stars, a singing competition, are usually filmed on this stage. Onlookers can usually be seen crowding the second- and third-story balconies overlooking the stage during taping.

correspondent and columnist. Casey was born March 14, 1890, in Beresford, South Dakota, and attended St. Mary's College in St. Marys, Kansas from 1907 to 1911. Casey enlisted in the Army in 1918 and served at Verdun and Meuse-Argonne as an artilleryman. He earned three citations for bravery in combat before his discharge as a captain in 1919. Casey later wrote (anonymously) The Cannoneers Have Hairy Ears: A Diary of the Front Lines about his wartime experiences, and this book was acclaimed for its gritty and realistic depictions of an American soldier in World War I. In 1920, Casey joined the Chicago Daily News, where he worked as a columnist and foreign correspondent for twenty-seven years. Casey wrote features, chronicled the Chicago gang wars of the era, and compiled \\"slice of life\\" stories, which were published in the paper under column titles \\"Vest Pocket Anthology,\\" \\"Such Interesting People,\\" and \\"More Interesting People.\\" During the 1920s and 1930s, Casey traveled through Indochina, Cuba, Pitcairn Islands and Easter Island, and many other sites, and wrote about his adventures in newspaper columns and books. In 1940, Casey covered the blitz in London and its aftermath; he was also in Hawaii and the Pacific right after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December, 1941. After his coverage of World War II in France, Africa, and the Pacific, Casey came back to Chicago to write. He had been married to Marie Driscoll, who died in 1945; in 1946 Casey married Hazel MacDonald, a reporter and fellow Chicago-based foreign correspondent he first met in 1933. After Casey's retirement from the Daily News in 1947, he continued to write books and freelance newspaper articles. In 1955, he was named Press Veteran of the Year by the Chicago Press Veterans Association. After being under treatment for several years for a heart condition and high blood pressure, Casey died of a stroke on Dec. 5, 1962 in Evanston, Illinois at the age of 72.

He was the longest serving President in Poland's history.August Zaleski was president of the Polish Government in Exile for 25 years, from 1947 until his death. He was serving as the president of Poland when Germany invaded the country on 1 September 1939, starting World War II. Early life and career Mo≈õcicki was born on 1 December 1867 in Mierzanowo, a small village near Ciechan√≥w, Congress Poland. After completing school in Warsaw, he studied chemistry at the Riga Polytechnicum. There he joined the Polish underground leftist organization, Proletariat. Upon graduating, he returned to Warsaw, but was threatened by the Tsarist secret police with life imprisonment in Siberia and was forced to emigrate in 1892 to London. In 1896 he was offered an assistantship at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. There he patented a method for cheap industrial production of nitric acid. In 1912 Mo≈õcicki moved to Lemberg (; modern Lviv, Ukraine), in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where he accepted a chair in physical chemistry and technical electrochemistry at the Lemberg Polytechnic.Norman Davies, God's Playground, vol. II, Oxford University Press, 1986, , p. 422. In 1925 he was elected rector of the Lw√≥w Polytechnic (as it was now called), but soon moved to Warsaw to continue his research at the Warsaw Polytechnic. In 1926, he became an Honorary Member of the Polish Chemical Society. Presidency Mo≈õcicki bestows the bulawa (the Marshal of Poland's baton) on Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy After J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's May 1926 coup d'√©tat, on 1 June 1926, Mo≈õcicki, once an associate of Pi≈Çsudski in the Polish Socialist Party, was elected president of Poland by the National Assembly on the Pi≈Çsudski's recommendation after Pi≈Çsudski had refused the office for himself. As president, Mo≈õcicki was subservient to Pi≈Çsudski and never openly showed dissent from any aspect of the Marshal's leadership. After Pi≈Çsudski's death in 1935, his followers divided into three main factions: those supporting Mo≈õcicki as Pi≈Çsudski's successor, those supporting General Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy, and those supporting Prime Minister Walery S≈Çawek. With a view to eliminating S≈Çawek from the game, Mo≈õcicki concluded a power-sharing agreement with Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy, which saw S≈Çawek marginalized as a serious political player by the end of the year. As a result of the agreement, Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy would become the de facto leader of Poland until the outbreak of the war, and Mo≈õcicki remained influential by continuing in office as president. Mo≈õcicki was the leading moderate figure in the regime, which was referred to as the \\"colonels' government\\" because of the major presence of military officers in the Polish government. Mo≈õcicki opposed many of the nationalist excesses of the more right-wing Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy, but their pact remained more or less intact. Mo≈õcicki remained president until September 1939, when he was interned in RomaniaStanislaw Mikolajczyk, The Pattern of Soviet Domination, Sampson Low, Marston & Co., 1948, p. 6. following the German invasion of Poland and was forced by France to resign his office. He transferred the office to General Boles≈Çaw Wieniawa-D≈Çugoszowski, who held it for only one day before General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski and the French government ousted him in favour of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raczkiewicz. Later life Mo≈õcicki's grave in the basement of the St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw Mo≈õcicki was planning to leave for Switzerland after leaving office as President. From 1908 to 1920, he was a citizen of Switzerland; he was also an honorary citizen of the Fribourg commune. The Romanian authorities gave their provisional consent to his departure, but Germany opposed it. Mo≈õcicki was offered to US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was determined to have Mo≈õcicki go to Switzerland. The intervention of the US government forced the Romanian authorities to agree. General Sikorski also ordered the Polish embassy in Bucharest to provide all assistance to Mo≈õcicki. The president stayed in Romania until December 1939. Mo≈õcicki came to Switzerland through Milan, where he met with Boles≈Çaw Wieniawa-D≈Çugoszowski. Initially, he lived in Friborg, where he was allowed to continue his scientific work. During this period, among others, he wrote down his memories, which were published by the New York magazine Independence. Mo≈õcicki donated money to soldiers of the Polish Army in France, Warsaw residents in prisoner-of-war camps, concentration camps and labor camps. For five months, he taught at the University of Fribourg. Later, he was forced to take up paid work. In 1940, he moved to Geneva, where he worked in the Hydro- Nitro Chemical Laboratory. Mo≈õcicki's health deteriorated rapidly after 1943. He died on 2 October 1946, in Versoix, near Geneva. In 1984, his descendants requested that the remains of Mo≈õcicki and his wife be moved from Switzerland to Poland. The relevant Polish authorities agreed that a funeral was to be held in Warsaw and be completely private, without any state ceremonies. However, the authorities of the Canton of Geneva in Switzerland withdrew their agreement for political reasons after protests related to Solidarity from emigrants. In 1993, Mo≈õcicki's remains were transported, on behalf of incumbent President Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, to Poland and deposited in the crypt of St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw. Mo≈õcicki's symbolic grave is located in the Avenue of Merit at the PowƒÖzki Cemetery in Warsaw, where his second wife is buried next to him. Gallery File:I.

He is nowadays overshadowed, even as a writer, by the more famous British statesman of the same name, to whom he was not related. Early life Churchill was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Edward Spalding Churchill by his marriage to Emma Bell Blaine. He attended Smith Academy in Missouri and the United States Naval Academy, where he graduated in 1894. At the Naval Academy, he was conspicuous in scholarship and also in general student activities. He became an expert fencer and he organized at Annapolis the first eight-oared crew, which he captained for two years. After graduation he became an editor of the Army and Navy Journal. He resigned from the navy to pursue a writing career. In 1895, he became managing editor of the Cosmopolitan Magazine, but in less than a year he retired from that, to have more time for writing. While he would be most successful as a novelist, he was also a published poet and essayist. Career His first novel to appear in book form was The Celebrity (1898). However, Mr. Keegan's Elopement had been published in 1896 as a magazine serial and was republished as an illustrated hardback book in 1903. Churchill's next novel‚ÄîRichard Carvel (1899)‚Äîwas a phenomenal success, selling some two million copies in a nation of only 76 million people, and made him rich. His next two novels, The Crisis (1901) and The Crossing (1904), were also very successful. Churchill's early novels were historical, but his later works were set in contemporary America. He often sought to include his political ideas into his novels. Churchill at his home, Windsor, Vermont In 1898, a mansion designed by Charles Platt was built for Churchill in Cornish, New Hampshire. In 1899, Churchill moved there and named it Harlakenden House. The house was also used as the summer home of Woodrow Wilson from 1913-1915 (he leased it from Churchill). He became involved in the Cornish Art Colony and went into politics, being elected to the state legislature in 1903 and 1905. In 1906 he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor of New Hampshire. In 1912, he was nominated as the Progressive candidate for governor but did not win the election and did not seek public office again. In 1917, he toured the battlefields of World War I and wrote about what he saw, his first non-fiction work. Sometime after this move, he took up painting in watercolors and became known for his landscapes. Some of his works are in the collections of the Hood Museum of Art (part of Hopkins Center for the Arts at Dartmouth College) in Hanover, New Hampshire, and the Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site in Cornish, New Hampshire. Churchill's books sold well, according to Alice Hackett's 70 Years of Best Sellers, for example, Richard Carvel was third (1899) and eighth (1900), The Crisis (1901), The Crossing (1904), Coniston (1906) and Mr. Crewe's Career (1908), The Inside of the Cup (1913) all first, in the American fiction best seller rankings.Alice Hackett's 70 Years of Best Sellers, pp 95-110 In 1919, Churchill decided to stop writing and withdrew from public life. As a result of this he was gradually forgotten by the public. In 1923, Harlakenden House burned down. The Churchills moved to an 1838 Federal estate, part of the Cornish Colony called Windfield House (now called Hillside) at 23 Freeman Road in Plainfield, NH, furnishing it with items saved from the fire.[http://www.cowhampshireblog.com/2008/02/16/the-american-winston- churchill-1871-1947/ The American Winston Churchill 1871-1947 In 1940, The Uncharted Way, his first book in twenty years, was published. The book examined Churchill's thoughts on religion. He did not seek to publicize the book and it received little attention. Shortly before his death he said, \\"It is very difficult now for me to think of myself as a writer of novels, as all that seems to belong to another life.\\" Death Churchill died in Winter Park, Florida, in 1947 of a heart attack. He was predeceased in 1945 by his wife of fifty years, the former Mabel Harlakenden Hall.(28 May 1945). MRS. WINSTON CHURCHILL; Wife of American Novelist Dies in New Hampshire, The New York Times He is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 16) along New Hampshire Route 12A in Cornish. Churchill and his wife had three children, including their son Creighton Churchill, a well-known writer on wines.(1 December 1984).

Creighton Churchill: A wine taster par excellence, Boca Raton News His great-grandson is the Albany, New York, journalist Chris Churchill. The British statesman In the 1890s, Churchill's writings first came to be confused with those of the British writer with the same name. At that time, the American was the much better known of the two, and it was the Englishman who wrote to his American counterpart about the confusion their names were causing among their readers. They agreed that the British Churchill should adopt the pen name \\"Winston Spencer Churchill\\", using his full surname, \\"Spencer-Churchill\\". After a few early editions this was abbreviated to \\"Winston S. Churchill\\"‚Äîwhich remained the British Churchill's pen name. The two men arranged to meet on two occasions when one of them happened to be in the other's country, but were never closely acquainted. Their lives had some other coincidental parallels. They both gained their tertiary education at service colleges and briefly served (during the same period) as officers in their respective countries' armed forces (one was a naval, the other an army officer). Both Churchills were keen amateur painters, as well as writers. Both were also politicians, although here the comparison is far more tenuous, the British Churchill's political career being far more illustrious.

As an illustration, suppose that we are interested in the properties of a function as becomes very large. If , then as becomes very large, the term becomes insignificant compared to . The function is said to be \\"asymptotically equivalent to , as \\". This is often written symbolically as , which is read as \\" is asymptotic to \\". An example of an important asymptotic result is the prime number theorem. Let denote the prime-counting function (which is not directly related to the constant pi), i.e. is the number of prime numbers that are less than or equal to . Then the theorem states that :\\\\pi(x)\\\\sim\\\\frac{x}{\\\\ln x}.  Definition  Formally, given functions and , we define a binary relation :f(x) \\\\sim g(x) \\\\quad (\\\\text{as } x\\\\to\\\\infty) if and only if :\\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 1. The symbol is the tilde. The relation is an equivalence relation on the set of functions of ; the functions and are said to be asymptotically equivalent. The domain of and can be any set for which the limit is defined: e.g. real numbers, complex numbers, positive integers. The same notation is also used for other ways of passing to a limit: e.g. , , . The way of passing to the limit is often not stated explicitly, if it is clear from the context. Although the above definition is common in the literature, it is problematic if is zero infinitely often as goes to the limiting value. For that reason, some authors use an alternative definition. The alternative definition, in little-o notation, is that if and only if :f(x) - g(x) = o(g(x)). This definition is equivalent to the prior definition if is not zero in some neighbourhood of the limiting value.  Properties  If f \\\\sim g and a \\\\sim b, then under some mild conditions, the following hold. * f^r \\\\sim g^r, for every real * \\\\log(f) \\\\sim \\\\log(g) * f\\\\times a \\\\sim g\\\\times b * f / a \\\\sim g / b Such properties allow asymptotically-equivalent functions to be freely exchanged in many algebraic expressions. Examples of asymptotic formulas * Factorial ::n! \\\\sim \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi n}\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{e}\\\\right)^n :‚Äîthis is Stirling's approximation * Partition function :For a positive integer n, the partition function, p(n), gives the number of ways of writing the integer n as a sum of positive integers, where the order of addends is not considered. ::p(n)\\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{4n\\\\sqrt{3}} e^{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2n}{3}}} * Airy function :The Airy function, Ai(x), is a solution of the differential equation ; it has many applications in physics. ::\\\\operatorname{Ai}(x) \\\\sim \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\frac{2}{3} x^\\\\frac{3}{2}}}{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} x^{1/4}} * Hankel functions ::\\\\begin{align} H_\\\\alpha^{(1)}(z) &\\\\sim \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi z}} e^{ i\\\\left(z - \\\\frac{2\\\\pi\\\\alpha - \\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)} \\\\ H_\\\\alpha^{(2)}(z) &\\\\sim \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi z}} e^{-i\\\\left(z - \\\\frac{2\\\\pi\\\\alpha - \\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)} \\\\end{align}  Construction   General  Consider: ::h(x) = f(x)(1-F(x)) + g(x)F(x) where f(x) and g(x) are real-valued analytic functions, and F(x) is a Cumulative distribution function. Then h(x) is asymptotic to f(x) as x\\\\to (-\\\\infty) and asymptotic to g(x) as x\\\\to (+\\\\infty).  Asymptotic to two different polynomials  Suppose we want a real-valued function that is asymptotic to (a_0 + a_1 x) as x\\\\to (-\\\\infty) and is asymptotic to (b_0 + b_1 x) as x\\\\to (+\\\\infty). Then ::h(x) = (a_0 + a_1 x)(1-F(x)) + (b_0 + b_1 x)F(x) will do this. Asymptotic expansion An asymptotic expansion of a function is in practice an expression of that function in terms of a series, the partial sums of which do not necessarily converge, but such that taking any initial partial sum provides an asymptotic formula for . The idea is that successive terms provide an increasingly accurate description of the order of growth of . In symbols, it means we have f \\\\sim g_1, but also f - g_1 \\\\sim g_2 and f - g_1 - \\\\cdots - g_{k-1} \\\\sim g_{k} for each fixed k. In view of the definition of the \\\\sim symbol, the last equation means f - (g_1 + \\\\cdots + g_k) = o(g_k) in the little o notation, i.e., f - (g_1 + \\\\cdots + g_k) is much smaller than g_k. The relation f - g_1 - \\\\cdots - g_{k-1} \\\\sim g_{k} takes its full meaning if g_{k+1} = o(g_k) for all k, which means the g_k form an asymptotic scale. In that case, some authors may abusively write f \\\\sim g_1 + \\\\cdots + g_k to denote the statement f - (g_1 + \\\\cdots + g_k) = o(g_k). One should however be careful that this is not a standard use of the \\\\sim symbol, and that it does not correspond to the definition given in . In the present situation, this relation g_{k} = o(g_{k-1}) actually follows from combining steps k and k‚àí1; by subtracting f - g_1 - \\\\cdots - g_{k-2} = g_{k-1} + o(g_{k-1}) from f - g_1 - \\\\cdots - g_{k-2} - g_{k-1} = g_{k} + o(g_{k}), one gets g_{k} + o(g_{k})=o(g_{k-1}), i.e. g_{k} = o(g_{k-1}). In case the asymptotic expansion does not converge, for any particular value of the argument there will be a particular partial sum which provides the best approximation and adding additional terms will decrease the accuracy. This optimal partial sum will usually have more terms as the argument approaches the limit value. Examples of asymptotic expansions * Gamma function ::\\\\frac{e^x}{x^x \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi x}} \\\\Gamma(x+1) \\\\sim 1+\\\\frac{1}{12x}+\\\\frac{1}{288x^2}-\\\\frac{139}{51840x^3}-\\\\cdots \\\\ (x \\\\to \\\\infty) * Exponential integral ::xe^xE_1(x) \\\\sim \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^nn!}{x^n} \\\\ (x \\\\to \\\\infty) * Error function :: \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}x e^{x^2}{\\\\rm erfc}(x) \\\\sim 1+\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty (-1)^n \\\\frac{(2n-1)!!}{n!(2x^2)^n} \\\\ (x \\\\to \\\\infty) :where is the double factorial. Worked example Asymptotic expansions often occur when an ordinary series is used in a formal expression that forces the taking of values outside of its domain of convergence. For example, we might start with the ordinary series :\\\\frac{1}{1-w}=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty w^n The expression on the left is valid on the entire complex plane w e 1, while the right hand side converges only for w< 1. Multiplying by e^{-w/t} and integrating both sides yields : \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\frac{w}{t}}}{1 - w} \\\\, dw = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty t^{n+1} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-u} u^n \\\\, du The integral on the left hand side can be expressed in terms of the exponential integral. The integral on the right hand side, after the substitution u=w/t, may be recognized as the gamma function. Evaluating both, one obtains the asymptotic expansion :e^{-\\\\frac{1}{t}} \\\\operatorname{Ei}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\right) = \\\\sum _{n=0}^\\\\infty n! \\\\; t^{n+1} Here, the right hand side is clearly not convergent for any non-zero value of t. However, by keeping t small, and truncating the series on the right to a finite number of terms, one may obtain a fairly good approximation to the value of \\\\operatorname{Ei}(1/t). Substituting x = -1/t and noting that \\\\operatorname{Ei}(x) = -E_1(-x) results in the asymptotic expansion given earlier in this article.  Asymptotic distribution  In mathematical statistics, an asymptotic distribution is a hypothetical distribution that is in a sense the \\"limiting\\" distribution of a sequence of distributions. A distribution is an ordered set of random variables Zi for i = 1, ..., n, for some positive integer n. An asymptotic distribution allows i to range without bound, that is, n is infinite. A special case of an asymptotic distribution is when the late entries go to zero‚Äîthat is, the Zi go to 0 as i goes to infinity. Some instances of \\"asymptotic distribution\\" refer only to this special case. This is based on the notion of an asymptotic function which cleanly approaches a constant value (the asymptote) as the independent variable goes to infinity; \\"clean\\" in this sense meaning that for any desired closeness epsilon there is some value of the independent variable after which the function never differs from the constant by more than epsilon. An asymptote is a straight line that a curve approaches but never meets or crosses. Informally, one may speak of the curve meeting the asymptote \\"at infinity\\" although this is not a precise definition. In the equation y = \\\\frac{1}{x}, y becomes arbitrarily small in magnitude as x increases. Applications Asymptotic analysis is used in several mathematical sciences. In statistics, asymptotic theory provides limiting approximations of the probability distribution of sample statistics, such as the likelihood ratio statistic and the expected value of the deviance. Asymptotic theory does not provide a method of evaluating the finite-sample distributions of sample statistics, however. Non-asymptotic bounds are provided by methods of approximation theory. Examples of applications are the following. * In applied mathematics, asymptotic analysis is used to build numerical methods to approximate equation solutions. * In mathematical statistics and probability theory, asymptotics are used in analysis of long-run or large-sample behaviour of random variables and estimators. * in computer science in the analysis of algorithms, considering the performance of algorithms. * the behavior of physical systems, an example being statistical mechanics. * in accident analysis when identifying the causation of crash through count modeling with large number of crash counts in a given time and space. Asymptotic analysis is a key tool for exploring the ordinary and partial differential equations which arise in the mathematical modelling of real-world phenomena.Howison, S. (2005), Practical Applied Mathematics, Cambridge University Press An illustrative example is the derivation of the boundary layer equations from the full Navier-Stokes equations governing fluid flow. In many cases, the asymptotic expansion is in power of a small parameter, : in the boundary layer case, this is the nondimensional ratio of the boundary layer thickness to a typical lengthscale of the problem. Indeed, applications of asymptotic analysis in mathematical modelling often center around a nondimensional parameter which has been shown, or assumed, to be small through a consideration of the scales of the problem at hand. Asymptotic expansions typically arise in the approximation of certain integrals (Laplace's method, saddle-point method, method of steepest descent) or in the approximation of probability distributions (Edgeworth series). The Feynman graphs in quantum field theory are another example of asymptotic expansions which often do not converge.

It is a member of the starling family (Sturnidae), resident in hill regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia. The Sri Lanka hill myna, a former subspecies of G. religiosa, is now generally accepted as a separate species G. ptilogenys. The Enggano hill myna (G. enganensis) and Nias hill myna (G. robusta) are also widely accepted as specifically distinct, and many authors favor treating the southern hill myna (G. indica) from the Nilgiris and elsewhere in the Western Ghats of India as a separate species. The common hill myna is a popular talking bird. Its specific name religiosa may allude to the practice of teaching mynas to repeat prayers. Description This is a stocky jet-black myna, with bright orange-yellow patches of naked skin and fleshy wattles on the side of its head and nape. At about 29 cm length, it is somewhat larger than the common myna (Acridotheres tristis).Ali & Ripley (1983), Grimmett et al. (1998) It is overall green-glossed black plumage, purple-tinged on the head and neck. Its large, white wing patches are obvious in flight, but mostly covered when the bird is sitting. The bill and strong legs are bright yellow, and there are yellow wattles on the nape and under the eye. These differ conspicuously in shape from the naked eye-patch of the common myna and bank myna (A. ginginianus), and more subtly vary between the different hill mynas from South Asia: in the common hill myna, they extend from the eye to the nape, where they join, while the Sri Lanka hill myna has a single wattle across the nape and extending a bit towards the eyes. In the southern hill myna, the wattles are separate and curve towards the top of the head. The Nias and Enggano hill mynas differ in details of the facial wattles, and size, particularly that of the bill. Sexes are similar; juveniles have a duller bill. With the southern, Nias and Enggano hill mynas as separate species, the common hill myna, Gracula religiosa, has seven or eight subspecies, which differ only slightly. They are:Sankaran (1998), elitparrots.ru (2008), Clements (2007), Dickinson (2003) * G. r. andamanensis Beavan 1867 ‚Äì the Andaman hill myna; the Andaman Islands, the central (Nancowry) group of the Nicobar Islands * G. r. batuensis ‚Äì the Batu hill myna; the Batu and Mentawai Islands * G. r. halibrecta Oberholser 1926 ‚Äì the Great Nicobar hill myna; Great Nicobar, Little Nicobar and adjacent islets in the Nicobar Islands; doubtfully distinct from G. r. andamanensis * G. r. intermedia ‚Äì northwestern Indochina and adjacent northeastern India and southern China * G. r. palawanensis ‚Äì the Palawan hill myna; Palawan in the Philippines * G. r. peninsularis ‚Äì the Bastar hill mynah; central India (the state bird of Chhattisgarh, India) * G. r. religiosa ‚Äì the eastern hill myna; the Greater Sundas (except Sulawesi) and Peninsular Malaysia * G. r. venerata ‚Äì the Tenggara hill myna; the western Lesser Sundas Vocalisations Calls recorded in Thailand The common hill myna is often detected by its loud, shrill, descending whistles followed by other calls. It is most vocal at dawn and dusk, when it is found in small groups in forest clearings high in the canopy. Both sexes can produce an extraordinarily wide range of loud calls ‚Äì whistles, wails, screeches, and gurgles, sometimes melodious and often very human-like in quality. Each individual has a repertoire of three to 13 such call types, which may be shared with some near neighbours of the same sex, being learned when young. Dialects change rapidly with distance, such that birds living more than 15 km apart have no call-types in common with one another. Unlike some other birds, such as the greater racket-tailed drongo (Dicrurus paradiseus), the common hill myna does not imitate other birds in the wild, although it is a widely held misconception that they do. On the other hand, in captivity, they are among the most renowned mimics, perhaps on par only with the grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus). They can learn to reproduce many everyday sounds, particularly the human voice, and even whistled tunes, with astonishing accuracy and clarity.Klatt & Stefanski (1974), Klingholz (1979) Distribution and ecology Courting pair allopreening at Jayanti in the Buxa Tiger Reserve (Jalpaiguri district, West Bengal, India) This myna is a resident breeder from Kumaon division in India (80¬∞ E longitude) east through Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh, the lower Himalayas, terai and foothills up to 2,000 m ASL. Its range continues east through Southeast Asia northeastwards to southern China, and via Thailand southeastwards across northern Indonesia to Palawan in the Philippines. It is virtually extinct in Bangladesh due to habitat destruction and overexploitation for the pet trade. A feral population on Christmas Island has likewise disappeared. Introduced populations exist in Saint Helena, Puerto Rico and perhaps in the mainland United States and possibly elsewhere; feral birds require at least a warm subtropical climate to persist. This myna is almost entirely arboreal, moving in large, noisy groups of half a dozen or so, in tree-tops at the edge of the forest. It hops sideways along the branch, unlike the characteristic jaunty walk of other mynas. Like most starlings, the hill myna is fairly omnivorous, eating fruit, nectar and insects. They build a nest in a hole in a tree. The usual clutch is two or three eggs. There is no sexual dimorphism in these birds, which results in a limited possibility of choosing the sex to work with for mating.Mete A. (2003) Pet trade and conservation Adult at Jurong Bird Park, Singapore Eggs at the Mus√©um de Toulouse The hill mynas are popular cage birds, renowned for their ability to imitate speech. The widely distributed common hill myna is the one most frequently seen in aviculture. Demand outstrips captive breeding capacity, so they are rarely found in pet stores and usually purchased directly from breeders or importers who can certify the birds are traded legally. This species is widely distributed and locally common, and if adult stocks are safeguarded, it is able to multiply quickly. On a worldwide scale, the IUCN thus considers the common hill myna a Species of Least Concern. But in the 1990s, nearly 20,000 wild-caught birds, mostly adults and juveniles, were brought into trade each year. In the central part of its range, G. r. intermedia populations have declined markedly, especially in Thailand, which supplied much of the thriving Western market. Its neighbor countries, from where exports were often limited due to political or military reasons, nevertheless supplied a burgeoning domestic demand, and demand in the entire region continues to be very high. In 1992, Thailand had the common hill myna put on CITES Appendix III, to safeguard its stocks against collapsing. In 1997, at the request of the Netherlands and the Philippines, the species was uplisted to CITES Appendix II. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands subspecies G. r. andamanensis and (if valid) G. r. halibrecta, described as \\"exceedingly common\\" in 1874, qualified as Near Threatened in 1991. The former is not at all common anymore in the Nicobar Islands and the latter‚Äîif distinct‚Äîhas a very limited range.Sankaran (1998), BLI (2008) Elsewhere, such as on the Philippines and in Laos, the decline has been more localized. It is also becoming increasingly rare in the regions of northeastern India due to capture of fledged birds for the illegal pet trade. In the Garo Hills region, however, the locals make artificial nests of a split-bamboo framework covered with grass, and put them up in accessible positions in tall trees in a forest clearing or at the edge of a small village to entice the mynas to breed there. The villagers are thus able to extract the young at the proper time for easy hand-rearing, making common hill myna farming a profitable, small-scale cottage industry. It helps to preserve the environment, because the breeding birds are not removed from the population, while habitat destruction is curtailed because the mynas will desert areas of extensive logging and prefer more natural forest to plantations. As the mynas can be somewhat of a pest of fruit trees when too numerous, an additional benefit to the locals is the inexpensive means of controlling the myna population: failing stocks can be bolstered by putting out more nests than can be harvested, while the maximum proportion of nestlings are taken when the population becomes too large.Ali & Ripley (1983), BLI (2008) See also *Talking birds Footnotes References * Ali, Salim & Sidney Dillon Ripley (1983).

This technique was originally presented in . The idea of Laplace's method f(x) = \\\\tfrac{\\\\sin(x)}{x} has a global maximum at 0. e^{Mf(x)} is shown on top for M = 0.5, and at the bottom for M = 3 (both in blue). As M grows the approximation of this function by a Gaussian function (shown in red) improves. This observation underlies Laplace's method. Suppose the function f(x) has a unique global maximum at x0. Let M be a constant and consider the following two functions: :\\\\begin{align} g(x) &= Mf(x) \\\\ h(x) &= e^{Mf(x)} \\\\end{align} Note that x0 will be the global maximum of g and h as well. Now observe: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{g(x_0)}{g(x)} &= \\\\frac{M f(x_0)}{M f(x)} = \\\\frac{f(x_0)}{f(x)} [4pt] \\\\frac{h(x_0)}{h(x)} &= \\\\frac{e^{M f(x_0)}}{e^{M f(x)}} = e^{M(f(x_0) - f(x))} \\\\end{align} As M increases, the ratio for h will grow exponentially, while the ratio for g does not change. Thus, significant contributions to the integral of this function will come only from points x in a neighbourhood of x0, which can then be estimated. General theory of Laplace's method To state and motivate the method, we need several assumptions. We will assume that x0 is not an endpoint of the interval of integration, that the values f(x) cannot be very close to f(x_0) unless x is close to x0, and that f(x_0)<0. We can expand f(x) around x0 by Taylor's theorem, :f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0) + \\\\frac{1}{2} f(x_0)(x-x_0)^2 + R where R = O\\\\left((x-x_0)^3\\\\right) (see: big O notation). Since f has a global maximum at x0, and since x0 is not an endpoint, it is a stationary point, so the derivative of f vanishes at x0. Therefore, the function f(x) may be approximated to quadratic order :f(x) \\\\approx f(x_0) - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\leftf(x_0)\\\\right (x-x_0)^2 for x close to x0 (recall f(x_0)<0). The assumptions ensure the accuracy of the approximation :\\\\int_a^b e^{M f(x)}\\\\, dx\\\\approx e^{M f(x_0)}\\\\int_a^b e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2} Mf(x_0) (x-x_0)^2} \\\\, dx (see the picture on the right). This latter integral is a Gaussian integral if the limits of integration go from ‚àí‚àû to +‚àû (which can be assumed because the exponential decays very fast away from x0), and thus it can be calculated. We find :\\\\int_a^b e^{M f(x)}\\\\, dx\\\\approx \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{Mf(x_0)}}e^{M f(x_0)} \\\\text { as } M\\\\to\\\\infty. A generalization of this method and extension to arbitrary precision is provided by . Formal statement and proof Suppose f(x) is a twice continuously differentiable function on [a,b], and there exists a unique point x_0 \\\\in (a,b) such that: :f(x_0) = \\\\max_{x \\\\in [a,b]} f(x) \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad f(x_0)<0. Then: :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx}{e^{nf(x_0)} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{n\\\\left(-f(x_0)\\\\right)}}}= 1. Lower bound: Let \\\\varepsilon > 0. Since f is continuous there exists \\\\delta >0 such that if x_0-c< \\\\delta then f(c) \\\\ge f(x_0) - \\\\varepsilon. By Taylor's Theorem, for any x \\\\in (x_0 - \\\\delta, x_0 + \\\\delta), :f(x) \\\\ge f(x_0) + \\\\frac{1}{2}(f(x_0) - \\\\varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2. Then we have the following lower bound: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx &\\\\ge \\\\int_{x_0 - \\\\delta}^{x_0 + \\\\delta} e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx \\\\ &\\\\ge e^{nf(x_0)} \\\\int_{x_0 - \\\\delta}^{x_0 + \\\\delta} e^{\\\\frac{n}{2}(f(x_0) - \\\\varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2} \\\\, dx \\\\ &= e^{nf(x_0)} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{n(-f(x_0) + \\\\varepsilon)}} \\\\int_{-\\\\delta \\\\sqrt{n(-f(x_0) + \\\\varepsilon)} }^{\\\\delta \\\\sqrt{n(-f(x_0) + \\\\varepsilon)} } e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}y^2} \\\\, dy \\\\end{align} where the last equality was obtained by a change of variables :y= \\\\sqrt{n(-f(x_0) + \\\\varepsilon)} (x-x_0). Remember f(x_0)<0 so we can take the square root of its negation. If we divide both sides of the above inequality by :e^{nf(x_0)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi}{n(-f(x_0))}} and take the limit we get: :\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\\\,dx}{e^{nf(x_0)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{n(-f(x_0))}}} \\\\ge \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} \\\\int_{-\\\\delta\\\\sqrt{n(-f(x_0) + \\\\varepsilon)} }^{\\\\delta \\\\sqrt{n(-f(x_0) + \\\\varepsilon)}} e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}y^2} \\\\, dy \\\\, \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{-f(x_0)}{-f(x_0) + \\\\varepsilon}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{-f(x_0)}{-f(x_0) + \\\\varepsilon}} since this is true for arbitrary \\\\varepsilon we get the lower bound: :\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx}{ e^{nf(x_0)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{n(-f(x_0))}}} \\\\ge 1 Note that this proof works also when a = -\\\\infty or b= \\\\infty (or both). Upper bound: The proof is similar to that of the lower bound but there are a few inconveniences. Again we start by picking an \\\\varepsilon >0 but in order for the proof to work we need \\\\varepsilon small enough so that f(x_0) + \\\\varepsilon < 0. Then, as above, by continuity of f and Taylor's Theorem we can find \\\\delta>0 so that if x-x_0 < \\\\delta, then :f(x) \\\\le f(x_0) + \\\\frac{1}{2} (f(x_0) + \\\\varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2. Lastly, by our assumptions (assuming a,b are finite) there exists an \\\\eta >0 such that if x-x_0\\\\ge \\\\delta, then f(x) \\\\le f(x_0) - \\\\eta. Then we can calculate the following upper bound: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx &\\\\le \\\\int_a^{x_0-\\\\delta} e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx + \\\\int_{x_0-\\\\delta}^{x_0 + \\\\delta} e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx + \\\\int_{x_0 + \\\\delta}^b e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx \\\\ &\\\\le (b-a)e^{n(f(x_0)-\\\\eta)} + \\\\int_{x_0-\\\\delta}^{x_0 + \\\\delta} e^{n f(x) } \\\\, dx \\\\ &\\\\le (b-a)e^{n(f(x_0)-\\\\eta)} + e^{nf(x_0)} \\\\int_{x_0-\\\\delta}^{x_0 + \\\\delta} e^{\\\\frac{n}{2}(f(x_0)+\\\\varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2} \\\\, dx\\\\ &\\\\le (b-a)e^{n(f(x_0)-\\\\eta)} + e^{nf(x_0)} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} e^{\\\\frac{n}{2}(f(x_0)+\\\\varepsilon)(x-x_0)^2} \\\\, dx \\\\ &\\\\le (b-a)e^{n(f(x_0)-\\\\eta)} + e^{nf(x_0)} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi}{n (-f(x_0) - \\\\varepsilon)}} \\\\end{align} If we divide both sides of the above inequality by :e^{nf(x_0)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi}{n (-f(x_0))}} and take the limit we get: :\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx}{e^{nf(x_0)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{n(-f(x_0))}}} \\\\le \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} (b-a) e^{-\\\\eta n} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n(-f(x_0))}{2\\\\pi}} + \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{-f(x_0)}{-f(x_0) - \\\\varepsilon}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{-f(x_0)}{-f(x_0) - \\\\varepsilon}} Since \\\\varepsilon is arbitrary we get the upper bound: :\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx}{e^{nf(x_0)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi}{n (-f(x_0))}}} \\\\le 1 And combining this with the lower bound gives the result. Note that the above proof obviously fails when a = -\\\\infty or b = \\\\infty (or both). To deal with these cases, we need some extra assumptions. A sufficient (not necessary) assumption is that for n = 1, :\\\\int_a^b e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx < \\\\infty, and that the number \\\\eta as above exists (note that this must be an assumption in the case when the interval [a,b] is infinite). The proof proceeds otherwise as above, but with a s lightly different approximation of integrals: :\\\\int_a^{x_0-\\\\delta} e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx + \\\\int_{x_0 + \\\\delta}^b e^{nf(x)} \\\\, dx \\\\le \\\\int_a^b e^{f(x)}e^{(n-1)(f(x_0) - \\\\eta)} \\\\, dx = e^{(n-1)(f(x_0) - \\\\eta)} \\\\int_a^b e^{f(x)} \\\\, dx. When we divide by :e^{nf(x_0)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{n(-f(x_0))}}, we get for this term :\\\\frac{e^{(n-1)(f(x_0) - \\\\eta)} \\\\int_a^b e^{f(x)} \\\\, dx}{e^{nf(x_0)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{n(-f(x_0))}}} = e^{-(n-1)\\\\eta} \\\\sqrt{n} e^{-f(x_0)} \\\\int_a^b e^{f(x)} \\\\, dx \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{-f(x_0)}{2\\\\pi}} whose limit as n \\\\to \\\\infty is 0. The rest of the proof (the analysis of the interesting term) proceeds as above. The given condition in the infinite interval case is, as said above, sufficient but not necessary. However, the condition is fulfilled in many, if not in most, applications: the condition simply says that the integral we are studying must be well-defined (not infinite) and that the maximum of the function at x_0 must be a \\"true\\" maximum (the number \\\\eta > 0 must exist). There is no need to demand that the integral is finite for n=1 but it is enough to demand that the integral is finite for some n=N. This method relies on 4 basic concepts such as :1. Relative error The ‚Äúapproximation‚Äù in this method is related to the relative error and not the absolute error. Therefore, if we set :s = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{M\\\\leftf(x_0)\\\\right}}. the integral can be written as :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_a^b e^{M f(x)} \\\\, dx &= se^{Mf(x_0)} \\\\frac{1}{s}\\\\int_a^b e^{M(f(x)-f(x_0))}\\\\, dx \\\\ & = se^{Mf(x_0)} \\\\int_{\\\\frac{a-x_0}{s}}^{\\\\frac{b-x_0}{s}} e^{M(f(sy+x_0)-f(x_0))}\\\\,dy \\\\end{align} where s is a small number when M is a large number obviously and the relative error will be :\\\\left \\\\int_{\\\\frac{a-x_0}{s}}^{\\\\frac{b-x_0}{s}} e^{M(f(sy+x_0)-f(x_0))} dy-1 \\\\right. Now, let us separate this integral into two parts: y\\\\in[-D_y,D_y] region and the rest. :2. e^{M (f(sy+x_0)-f(x_0))} \\\\to e^{-\\\\pi y^2} around the stationary point when M is large enough Let‚Äôs look at the Taylor expansion of M(f(x)-f(x_0)) around x0 and translate x to y because we do the comparison in y-space, we will get :M(f(x)-f(x_0)) = \\\\frac{Mf(x_0)}{2}s^2y^2 +\\\\frac{Mf'(x_0)}{6}s^3y^3+ \\\\cdots = -\\\\pi y^2 +O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{M}}\\\\right). Note that f'(x_0)=0 because x_0 is a stationary point. From this equation you will find that the terms higher than second derivative in this Taylor expansion is suppressed as the order of \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{M}} so that \\\\exp(M(f(x)-f(x_0))) will get closer to the Gaussian function as shown in figure. Besides, :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}e^{-\\\\pi y^2} dy =1. The figure of e^{M[f(sy+x_0)-f(x_0)]} with M equals 1, 2 and 3, and the red line is the curve of function e^{-\\\\pi y^2} . :3. The larger M is, the smaller range of x is related Because we do the comparison in y-space, y is fixed in y\\\\in[-D_y,D_y] which will cause x\\\\in[-sD_y, sD_y]; however, s is inversely proportional to \\\\sqrt{M}, the chosen region of x will be smaller when M is increased. :4. If the integral in Laplace‚Äôs method converges, the contribution of the region which is not around the stationary point of the integration of its relative error will tend to zero as M grows. Relying on the 3rd concept, even if we choose a very large Dy, sDy will finally be a very small number when M is increased to a huge number. Then, how can we guarantee the integral of the rest will tend to 0 when M is large enough? The basic idea is to find a function m(x) such that m(x)\\\\ge f(x) and the integral of e^{Mm(x)} will tend to zero when M grows. Because the exponential function of Mm(x) will be always larger than zero as long as m(x) is a real number, and this exponential function is proportional to m(x), the integral of e^{Mf(x)} will tend to zero. For simplicity, choose m(x) as a tangent through the point x=sD_y as shown in the figure: m(x) is denoted by the two tangent lines passing through x=\\\\pm sD_y+x_0. When sD_y gets smaller, the cover region will be larger. If the interval of the integration of this method is finite, we will find that no matter f(x) is continue in the rest region, it will be always smaller than m(x) shown above when M is large enough. By the way, it will be proved later that the integral of e^{Mm(x)} will tend to zero when M is large enough. If the interval of the integration of this method is infinite, m(x) and f(x) might always cross to each other. If so, we cannot guarantee that the integral of e^{Mf(x)} will tend to zero finally. For example, in the case of f(x)=\\\\tfrac{\\\\sin(x)}{x}, \\\\int^{\\\\infty}_{0}e^{Mf(x)} dx will always diverge. Therefore, we need to require that \\\\int^{\\\\infty}_{d}e^{Mf(x)} dx can converge for the infinite interval case. If so, this integral will tend to zero when d is large enough and we can choose this d as the cross of m(x) and f(x). You might ask that why not choose \\\\int^{\\\\infty}_{d}e^{f(x)} dx as a convergent integral? Let me use an example to show you the reason. Suppose the rest part of f(x) is -\\\\ln x, then e^{f(x)}=\\\\tfrac{1}{x} and its integral will diverge; however, when M=2, the integral of e^{Mf(x)}=\\\\tfrac{1}{x^2} converges. So, the integral of some functions will diverge when M is not a large number, but they will converge when M is large enough. Based on these four concepts, we can derive the relative error of this Laplace's method. Other formulations Laplace's approximation is sometimes written as :\\\\int_a^b h(x) e^{M g(x)}\\\\, dx \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{Mg(x_0)}} h(x_0) e^{M g(x_0)} \\\\ \\\\text { as } M\\\\to\\\\infty where h is positive. Importantly, the accuracy of the approximation depends on the variable of integration, that is, on what stays in g(x) and what goes into h(x). First, use x_0=0 to denote the global maximum, which will simplify this derivation. We are interested in the relative error, written as R, :\\\\int_a^b h(x) e^{M g(x)}\\\\, dx = h(0)e^{Mg(0)}s \\\\underbrace{\\\\int_{a/s}^{b/s}\\\\frac{h(x)}{h(0)}e^{M\\\\left[ g(sy)-g(0) \\\\right]} dy}_{1+R}, where :s\\\\equiv\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{M\\\\left g (0) \\\\right}}. So, if we let :A\\\\equiv \\\\frac{h(sy)}{h(0)}e^{M\\\\left[g(sy)-g(0) \\\\right]} and A_0\\\\equiv e^{-\\\\pi y^2}, we can get :\\\\left R\\\\right = \\\\left \\\\int_{a/s}^{b/s}A\\\\,dy -\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}A_0\\\\,dy \\\\right since \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}A_0\\\\,dy =1. For the upper bound, note that A+B \\\\le A+B, thus we can separate this integration into 5 parts with 3 different types (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Therefore, :R < \\\\underbrace{\\\\left \\\\int_{D_y}^{\\\\infty}A_0 dy \\\\right}_{(a_1)} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\left \\\\int_{D_y}^{b/s}A dy \\\\right}_{(b_1)}+ \\\\underbrace{\\\\left \\\\int_{-D_y}^{D_y}\\\\left(A-A_0\\\\right) dy \\\\right}_{(c)} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\left \\\\int_{a/s}^{-D_y}A dy \\\\right}_{(b_2)} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\left \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{-D_y}A_0 dy \\\\right}_{(a_2)} where (a_1) and (a_2) are similar, let us just calculate (a_1) and (b_1) and (b_2) are similar, too, I‚Äôll just calculate (b_1). For (a_1), after the translation of z\\\\equiv\\\\pi y^2, we can get :(a_1) = \\\\left \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}}\\\\int_{\\\\pi D_y^2}^{\\\\infty} e^{-z}z^{-1/2} dz\\\\right <\\\\frac{e^{-\\\\pi D_y^2}}{2\\\\pi D_y}. This means that as long as D_y is large enough, it will tend to zero. For (b_1), we can get :(b_1)\\\\le\\\\left \\\\int_{D_y}^{b/s}\\\\left[\\\\frac{h(sy)}{h(0)}\\\\right]_{\\\\text{max}} e^{Mm(sy)}dy \\\\right where :m(x) \\\\ge g(x)-g(0) \\\\text{as} x\\\\in [sD_y,b] and h(x) should have the same sign of h(0) during this region. Let us choose m(x) as the tangent across the point at x=sD_y , i.e. m(sy)= g(sD_y)-g(0) +g'(sD_y)\\\\left( sy-sD_y \\\\right) which is shown in the figure m(x) is the tangent lines across the point at x=sD_y . From this figure you can find that when s or D_y gets smaller, the region satisfies the above inequality will get larger. Therefore, if we want to find a suitable m(x) to cover the whole f(x) during the interval of (b_1), D_y will have an upper limit. Besides, because the integration of e^{-\\\\alpha x} is simple, let me use it to estimate the relative error contributed by this (b_1). Based on Taylor expansion, we can get :\\\\begin{align} M\\\\left[g(sD_y)-g(0)\\\\right] &= M\\\\left[ \\\\frac{g(0)}{2}s^2D_y^2 +\\\\frac{g'(\\\\xi)}{6}s^3D_y^3 \\\\right] && \\\\text{as } \\\\xi\\\\in[0,sD_y] \\\\ & = -\\\\pi D_y^2 +\\\\frac{(2\\\\pi)^{3/2}g'(\\\\xi)D_y^3}{6\\\\sqrt{M}g(0)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}}, \\\\end{align} and :\\\\begin{align} Msg'(sD_y) &= Ms\\\\left(g(0)sD_y +\\\\frac{g'(\\\\zeta)}{2}s^2D_y^2\\\\right) && \\\\text{as } \\\\zeta\\\\in[0,sD_y] \\\\ &= -2\\\\pi D_y +\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{M}}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{g(0)} \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}g'(\\\\zeta)D_y^2, \\\\end{align} and then substitute them back into the calculation of (b_1); however, you can find that the remainders of these two expansions are both inversely proportional to the square root of M, let me drop them out to beautify the calculation. Keeping them is better, but it will make the formula uglier. :\\\\begin{align} (b_1) &\\\\le \\\\left\\\\left[ \\\\frac{h(sy)}{h(0)} \\\\right]_{\\\\max} e^{-\\\\pi D_y^2}\\\\int_0^{b/s-D_y}e^{-2\\\\pi D_y y} dy \\\\right \\\\ &\\\\le \\\\left\\\\left[ \\\\frac{h(sy)}{h(0)} \\\\right]_{\\\\max} e^{-\\\\pi D_y^2}\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi D_y} \\\\right. \\\\end{align} Therefore, it will tend to zero when D_y gets larger, but don't forget that the upper bound of D_y should be considered during this calculation. About the integration near x=0, we can also use Taylor's Theorem to calculate it. When h'(0) e 0 :\\\\begin{align} (c) &\\\\le \\\\int_{-D_y}^{D_y} e^{-\\\\pi y^2} \\\\left \\\\frac{sh'(\\\\xi)}{h(0)}y \\\\right\\\\, dy \\\\ &< \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi M g(0)}} \\\\left \\\\frac{h'(\\\\xi)}{h(0)} \\\\right_\\\\max \\\\left( 1-e^{-\\\\pi D_y^2} \\\\right) \\\\end{align} and you can find that it is inversely proportional to the square root of M. In fact, (c) will have the same behave when h(x) is a constant. Conclusively, the integral near the stationary point will get smaller as \\\\sqrt{M} gets larger, and the rest parts will tend to zero as long as D_y is large enough; however, we need to remember that D_y has an upper limit which is decided by whether the function m(x) is always larger than g(x)-g(0) in the rest region. However, as long as we can find one m(x) satisfying this condition, the upper bound of D_y can be chosen as directly proportional to \\\\sqrt{M} since m(x) is a tangent across the point of g(x)-g(0) at x=sD_y. So, the bigger M is, the bigger D_y can be. In the multivariate case where \\\\mathbf{x} is a d-dimensional vector and f(\\\\mathbf{x}) is a scalar function of \\\\mathbf{x}, Laplace's approximation is usually written as: :\\\\int h(\\\\mathbf{x})e^{M f(\\\\mathbf{x})}\\\\, d\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\approx \\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{M}\\\\right)^{d/2} \\\\frac{h(\\\\mathbf{x}_0)e^{M f(\\\\mathbf{x}_0)}}{\\\\left-H(f)(\\\\mathbf{x}_0)\\\\right^{1/2}} \\\\text { as } M\\\\to\\\\infty where H(f)(\\\\mathbf{x}_0) is the Hessian matrix of f evaluated at \\\\mathbf{x}_0 and where \\\\cdot denotes matrix determinant. Analogously to the univariate case, the Hessian is required to be negative definite. By the way, although \\\\mathbf{x} denotes a d-dimensional vector, the term d\\\\mathbf{x} denotes an infinitesimal volume here, i.e. d\\\\mathbf{x} := dx_1dx_2\\\\cdots dx_d. Laplace's method extension: Steepest descent In extensions of Laplace's method, complex analysis, and in particular Cauchy's integral formula, is used to find a contour of steepest descent for an (asymptotically with large M) equivalent integral, expressed as a line integral. In particular, if no point x0 where the derivative of f vanishes exists on the real line, it may be necessary to deform the integration contour to an optimal one, where the above analysis will be possible. Again the main idea is to reduce, at least asymptotically, the calculation of the given integral to that of a simpler integral that can be explicitly evaluated. See the book of Erdelyi (1956) for a simple discussion (where the method is termed steepest descents). The appropriate formulation for the complex z-plane is :\\\\int_a^b e^{M f(z)}\\\\, dz \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{-Mf(z_0)}}e^{M f(z_0)} \\\\text{ as } M\\\\to\\\\infty. for a path passing through the saddle point at z0. Note the explicit appearance of a minus sign to indicate the direction of the second derivative: one must not take the modulus. Also note that if the integrand is meromorphic, one may have to add residues corresponding to poles traversed while deforming the contour (see for example section 3 of Okounkov's paper Symmetric functions and random partitions). Further generalizations An extension of the steepest descent method is the so-called nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method. Here, instead of integrals, one needs to evaluate asymptotically solutions of Riemann‚ÄìHilbert factorization problems. Given a contour C in the complex sphere, a function f defined on that contour and a special point, say infinity, one seeks a function M holomorphic away from the contour C, with prescribed jump across C, and with a given normalization at infinity. If f and hence M are matrices rather than scalars this is a problem that in general does not admit an explicit solution. An asymptotic evaluation is then possible along the lines of the linear stationary phase/steepest descent method. The idea is to reduce asymptotically the solution of the given Riemann‚ÄìHilbert problem to that of a simpler, explicitly solvable, Riemann‚ÄìHilbert problem. Cauchy's theorem is used to justify deformations of the jump contour. The nonlinear stationary phase was introduced by Deift and Zhou in 1993, based on earlier work of Its. A (properly speaking) nonlinear steepest descent method was introduced by Kamvissis, K. McLaughlin and P. Miller in 2003, based on previous work of Lax, Levermore, Deift, Venakides and Zhou. As in the linear case, \\"steepest descent contours\\" solve a min-max problem. In the nonlinear case they turn out to be \\"S-curves\\" (defined in a different context back in the 80s by Stahl, Gonchar and Rakhmanov). The nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method has applications to the theory of soliton equations and integrable models, random matrices and combinatorics. Laplace's method generalization: Median-point approximation In the generalization, evaluation of the integral is considered equivalent to finding the norm of the distribution with density :e^{M f(x)}. Denoting the cumulative distribution F(x), if there is a diffeomorphic Gaussian distribution with density :e^{-g -\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2}y^2} the norm is given by :\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\gamma^{-1}}e^{-g} and the corresponding diffeomorphism is :y(x)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma}}\\\\Phi^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{F(x)}{F(\\\\infty)}\\\\right), where \\\\Phi denotes cumulative standard normal distribution function. In general, any distribution diffeomorphic to the Gaussian distribution has density :e^{-g -\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2}y^2(x)}y'(x) and the median-point is mapped to the median of the Gaussian distribution. Matching the logarithm of the density functions and their derivatives at the median point up to a given order yields a system of equations that determine the approximate values of \\\\gamma and g. The approximation was introduced in 2019 by D. Makogon and C. Morais Smith primarily in the context of partition function evaluation for a system of interacting fermions. Complex integrals For complex integrals in the form: :\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{c-i\\\\infty}^{c+i\\\\infty} g(s)e^{st} \\\\,ds with t \\\\gg 1, we make the substitution t = iu and the change of variable s=c+ix to get the bilateral Laplace transform: :\\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty g(c+ix)e^{-ux}e^{icu} \\\\, dx. We then split g(c + ix) in its real and complex part, after which we recover u = t/i. This is useful for inverse Laplace transforms, the Perron formula and complex integration. Example: Stirling's approximation Laplace's method can be used to derive Stirling's approximation :N!\\\\approx \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi N} N^N e^{-N}\\\\, for a large integer N. From the definition of the Gamma function, we have :N! = \\\\Gamma(N+1)=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-x} x^N \\\\, dx. Now we change variables, letting x=Nz so that dx = Ndz. Plug these values back in to obtain :\\\\begin{align} N! &= \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-Nz} (Nz)^N N \\\\, dz \\\\ &= N^{N+1} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-Nz} z^N \\\\, dz \\\\ &= N^{N+1} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-Nz} e^{N\\\\ln z} \\\\, dz \\\\ &= N^{N+1} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{N(\\\\ln z-z)} \\\\, dz. \\\\end{align} This integral has the form necessary for Laplace's method with :f(z) = \\\\ln{z}-z which is twice- differentiable: :f'(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}-1, :f(z) = -\\\\frac{1}{z^2}. The maximum of f(z) lies at z0 = 1, and the second derivative of f(z) has the value ‚àí1 at this point. Therefore, we obtain :N! \\\\approx N^{N+1}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{N}} e^{-N}=\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi N} N^N e^{-N}.

It was split into the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) and Canada Social Transfer (CST) effective April 1, 2004, to provide greater accountability and transparency for federal health funding. Background The CHST was an amalgamation of two federal programs prior to 1996: Established Programs Financing (which paid for health care and post- secondary education and was established in 1977) and the Canada Assistance Plan (which supported social assistance and was established in 1966). Under the Constitution of Canada, health, education and social assistance are all areas of provincial responsibility and authority. The federal government does not directly participate in the administration of government services in these areas, though federal money through the CHST and its successors is used to fund them. But unlike equalization payments, which provinces can spend on anything, money distributed through the CHST is conditional and must be spent on health, post-secondary education or welfare. Legislation such as the Canada Health Act specify standards that the provinces must maintain in order to receive funding. The CHST and its successors consist of both cash transfers and tax transfers. Cash transfers are direct transfers of money from the federal government to the provinces. Tax transfers work because both federal and provincial governments collect personal and corporate income tax. A tax transfer involves the federal government reducing its income tax rates, leaving the provinces room (\\"tax points\\") by which they can increase their own taxes (and thus their revenues) without increasing the total tax burden on their citizens. Criticism The amount of transfer payments from the federal to the provincial governments is always controversial, particularly in the area of health care, which is of particular importance to Canadians. The premiers of Canadian provinces allege that federal funding has decreased markedly since the beginning of publicly funded health care, from fifty to sixteen cents of every dollar. The federal government denies this, saying that the provincial numbers ignore tax transfers and that federal funding never amounted to 50% of the cost of health care. The complexity of the funding formula means that each position depends on one's perspective. Critics of the CHST, CHT and CST note that the programs have allowed the federal government to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction by giving Ottawa a powerful hammer (the threat of withdrawing the transfers to any province that displeases the federal government). With the possible exception of Alberta, any province which lost the CHT and CST would quickly face the collapse of its health care system, fiscal impoverishment or perhaps both. Penalties for violation of conditions for receiving the health and social transfers have so far been restricted to cash deductions, as opposed to what would likely be a far more controversial penalty of actually attempting to charge differential federal tax rates in the offending province.

They developed a creole language, also called Gullah, and a culture with African influence. Historically, the Gullah region extended from the Cape Fear area on North Carolina's coast south to the vicinity of Jacksonville on Florida's coast. Today, the Gullah area is confined to the Georgia and South Carolina Lowcountry. The Gullah people and their language are also called Geechee, which may be derived from the name of the Ogeechee River near Savannah, Georgia. Gullah is a term that was originally used to designate the creole dialect of English spoken by Gullah and Geechee people. Over time, its speakers have used this term to formally refer to their creole language and distinctive ethnic identity as a people. The Georgia communities are distinguished by identifying as either \\"Freshwater Geechee\\" or \\"Saltwater Geechee\\", depending on whether they live on the mainland or the Sea Islands. Because of a period of relative isolation from whites while working on large plantations in rural areas, the Africans, enslaved from a variety of Central and West African ethnic groups, developed a creole culture that has preserved much of their African linguistic and cultural heritage from various peoples; in addition, they absorbed new influences from the region. The Gullah people speak an English-based creole language containing many African loanwords and influenced by African languages in grammar and sentence structure. Sometimes referred to as \\"Sea Island Creole\\" by linguists and scholars, the Gullah language is sometimes likened to Bahamian Creole, Barbadian Creole, Guyanese Creole, Belizean Creole, Jamaican Patois and the Krio language of West Africa. Gullah crafts, farming and fishing traditions, folk beliefs, music, rice-based cuisine and story-telling traditions all exhibit strong influences from Central and West African cultures. Etymology The origin of the word \\"Gullah\\" is unclear. Some scholars suggest that it may be cognate with the word \\"Angola\\", where the ancestors of some of the Gullah people likely originated. They created a new culture synthesized from that of the various African peoples brought into Charleston and other parts of South Carolina. Some scholars have suggested that it may come from the name of the Gola, an ethnic group living in the border area between present-day Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa, another area of enslaved ancestors of the Gullah people. British colonists in the Caribbean and the Southern colonies of North America referred to this area as the \\"Grain Coast\\" or \\"Rice Coast\\"; many of the tribes are of Mand√© or Manding origins. The name \\"Geechee\\", another common name for the Gullah people, may derive from the name of the Kissi people, an ethnic group living in the border area between Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Still another possible linguistic source for \\"Gullah\\" are the Dyula ethnic group of West Africa, from whom the American Gullah might be partially descended. The Dyula civilization had a large territory that stretched from Senegal through Mali to Burkina Faso and the rest of what was French West Africa. These were vast savanna lands with lower population densities. Slave raiding was easier and more common here than in forested areas with natural forms of physical defenses. The word \\"Dyula\\" is pronounced \\"Gwullah\\" among members of the Akan ethnic group in Ghana and Cote D'Ivoire. The primary land route through which captured Dyula people then came into contact with European slavers, was through the \\"Grain Coast\\" and \\"Rice Coast\\" (present-day Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegambia, and Guinea). Some scholars have also suggested indigenous American origins for these words. The Spanish named the South Carolina and Georgia coastal region as Guale, after a Native American tribe. The name of the Ogeechee River, a prominent geographical feature in coastal Georgia and central to Guale territory, may have been derived from a Creek Indian (Muskogee language) word. Sapelo Island, the site of the last Gullah community of Hog Hammock, was also principal place of refuge for Guale people who also fled slavery on the mainland. African roots According to Port of Charleston records, enslaved Africans shipped to the port came from the following areas: Angola (39%), Senegambia (20%), the Windward Coast (17%), the Gold Coast (13%), Sierra Leone (6%), and Madagascar, Mozambique, and the two Bights (viz., Benin and Biafra) (5% combined) (Pollitzer, 1999:43).Low Country Gullah Culture Special Resource Study and Final Environmental Impact Statement, National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office, p. 3 The term \\"Windward Coast\\" often referred to Sierra Leone, so the total figure of slaves from that region is higher than 6%. Particularly along the western coast, the local peoples had cultivated African rice for what is estimated to approach 3,000 years. African rice is a related, yet distinct species from Asian rice. It was originally domesticated in the inland delta of the Upper Niger River. Once British colonial planters in the American South discovered that African rice would grow in that region, they often sought enslaved Africans from rice- growing regions because of their skills and knowledge needed to develop and build irrigation, dams and earthworks. Two British trading companies based in England operated the slave castle at Bunce Island (formerly called Bance Island), located in the Sierra Leone River. Henry Laurens was their agent in Charleston and was a planter and slave trader. His counterpart in England was the Scottish merchant and slave trader Richard Oswald. Many of the enslaved Africans taken in West Africa were processed through Bunce Island. It was a prime export site for slaves to South Carolina and Georgia. Slave castles in Ghana, by contrast, shipped many of the people they handled to ports and markets in the Caribbean islands. After Freetown, Sierra Leone, was founded in the late 18th century by the British as a colony for poor blacks from London and black Loyalists from Nova Scotia, resettled after the American Revolutionary War, they did not allow slaves to be taken from Sierra Leone. They tried to protect the people from kidnappers. In 1808 both Great Britain and the United States prohibited the African slave trade. After that date, the British, whose navy patrolled to intercept slave ships off Africa, sometimes resettled Africans liberated from slave trader ships in Sierra Leone. Similarly, Americans sometimes settled freed slaves at Liberia, a similar colony established in the early 19th century by the American Colonization Society. As it was a place for freed slaves and free blacks from the United States, some free blacks emigrated there voluntarily, for the chance to create their own society. Origin of Gullah culture The Gullah region once extended from SE North Carolina to NE Florida. The Gullah people have been able to preserve much of their African cultural heritage because of climate, geography, cultural pride, and patterns of importation of enslaved Africans. Enslaved persons from the Central Western region of Africa, originating primarily from the Mende populations of what is today Sierra Leone, and transported to some areas of Brazil (including Bahia), the enslaved Gullah- Gheechee people were traded in what was then Charlestowne, South Carolina. According to British historian P.E.H. Hair, Gullah culture developed as a creole culture in the colonies and United States from the peoples of many different African cultures who came together there. These included the Baga, Fula, Kissi, Kpelle, Limba, Mandinka, Mende, Susu, Temne, Vai, and Wolof of the Rice Coast, and many from Angola, Igbo, Calabar, West Congo, and the Gold Coast. By the middle of the 18th century, thousands of acres in the Georgia and South Carolina Lowcountry, and the Sea Islands were developed as African rice fields. African farmers from the \\"Rice Coast\\" brought the skills for cultivation and tidal irrigation that made rice farming one of the most successful industries in early America. The subtropical climate encouraged the spread of malaria and yellow fever, which were both carried and transmitted by mosquitoes. These tropical diseases were endemic in Africa and had been carried by enslaved Africans to the colonies. Mosquitoes in the swamps and inundated rice fields of the Lowcountry picked up and spread the diseases to English and European settlers, as well. Malaria and yellow fever soon became endemic in the region. Because they had acquired some immunity in their homeland, Africans were more resistant to these tropical fevers than were the Europeans. As the rice industry was developed, planters continued to import enslaved Africans. By about 1708, South Carolina had a black majority. Coastal Georgia developed a black majority after rice cultivation expanded there in the mid-18th century. Malaria and yellow fever became endemic. Fearing these diseases, many white planters and their families left the Lowcountry during the rainy spring and summer months when fevers ran rampant. Others lived mostly in cities such as Charleston rather than on the isolated plantations, especially those on the Sea Islands. The planters left their European or African \\"rice drivers\\", or overseers, in charge of the rice plantations. These had hundreds of laborers, with African traditions reinforced by new imports from the same regions. Over time, the Gullah people developed a creole culture in which elements of African languages, cultures, and community life were preserved to a high degree. Their culture developed in a distinct way, different from that of the enslaved African Americans in states such as North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, where the enslaved lived in smaller groups, and had more sustained and frequent interactions with whites and British American culture. Civil War period When the U.S. Civil War began, the Union rushed to blockade Confederate shipping. White planters on the Sea Islands, fearing an invasion by the US naval forces, abandoned their plantations and fled to the mainland. When Union forces arrived on the Sea Islands in 1861, they found the Gullah people eager for their freedom, and eager as well to defend it. Many Gullah served with distinction in the Union Army's First South Carolina Volunteers. The Sea Islands were the first place in the South where slaves were freed. Long before the War ended, Unitarian missionaries from Pennsylvania came to start schools on the islands for the newly freed slaves. Penn Center, now a Gullah community organization on Saint Helena Island, South Carolina, was founded as the first school for freed slaves. After the Civil War ended, the Gullahs' isolation from the outside world increased in some respects. The rice planters on the mainland gradually abandoned their plantations and moved away from the area because of labor issues and hurricane damage to crops. Free blacks were unwilling to work in the dangerous and disease-ridden rice fields. A series of hurricanes devastated the crops in the 1890s. Left alone in remote rural areas of the Lowcountry, the Gullah continued to practice their traditional culture with little influence from the outside world well into the 20th century. Recent history Gullah basket In the 20th century, some plantations were redeveloped as resort or hunting destinations by wealthy whites. Gradually more visitors went to the islands to enjoy their beaches and mild climate. Since the late 20th century, the Gullah people‚Äîled by Penn Center and other determined community groups‚Äîhave been fighting to keep control of their traditional lands. Since the 1960s, resort development on the Sea Islands has greatly increased property values, threatening to push the Gullah off family lands which they have owned since emancipation. They have fought back against uncontrolled development on the islands through community action, the courts, and the political process. Coffin Point Praise House, 57 Coffin Point Rd, St. Helena Island, South Carolina The Gullah have also struggled to preserve their traditional culture in the face of much more contact with modern culture and media. In 1979, a translation of the New Testament into the Gullah language was begun. The American Bible Society published De Nyew Testament in 2005. In November 2011, Healin fa de Soul, a five-CD collection of readings from the Gullah Bible, was released. This collection includes Scipcha Wa De Bring Healing (\\"Scripture That Heals\\") and the Gospel of John (De Good Nyews Bout Jedus Christ Wa John Write). This was also the most extensive collection of Gullah recordings, surpassing those of Lorenzo Dow Turner. The recordings have helped people develop an interest in the culture, because they get to hear the language and learn how to pronounce some words. The Gullah achieved another victory in 2006 when the U.S. Congress passed the \\"Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Act\\"; it provided $10 million over 10 years for the preservation and interpretation of historic sites in the Low Country relating to Gullah culture.Bill Will Provide Millions for Gullah Community, National Public Radio, October 17, 2006 The Heritage Corridor will extend from southern North Carolina to northern Florida. The project will be administered by the US National Park Service, with extensive consultation with the Gullah community. The Gullah have also reached out to West Africa. Gullah groups made three celebrated \\"homecomings\\" to Sierra Leone in 1989, 1997, and 2005. Sierra Leone is at the heart of the traditional rice-growing region of West Africa where many of the Gullahs' ancestors originated. Bunce Island, the British slave castle in Sierra Leone, sent many African captives to Charleston and Savannah during the mid- and late 18th century. These dramatic homecomings were the subject of three documentary films‚ÄîFamily Across the Sea (1990), The Language You Cry In (1998), and Priscilla's Homecoming (in production).  Customs and traditions  A Gullah woman makes a sweetgrass basket in Charleston's City MarketWooden mortar and pestle from the rice loft of a South Carolina lowcountry plantation  African influences  *The Gullah word guber for peanut derives from the Kikongo and Kimbundu word N'guba. *Gullah rice dishes called \\"red rice\\" and \\"okra soup\\" are similar to West African \\"jollof rice\\" and \\"okra soup\\" and hog maws. Jollof rice is a traditional style of rice preparation brought by the Wolof people of West Africa.Slavery in America *The Gullah version of \\"gumbo\\" has its roots in African cooking. \\"Gumbo\\" is derived from a word in the Umbundu language of Angola, meaning okra, one of the dish's main ingredients. *Gullah rice farmers once made and used mortar and pestles and winnowing fanners similar in style to tools used by West African rice farmers. *Gullah beliefs about \\"hags\\" and \\"haunts\\" are similar to African beliefs about malevolent ancestors, witches, and \\"devils\\" (forest spirits). *Gullah \\"root doctors\\" protect their clients against dangerous spiritual forces by using ritual objects similar to those employed by African traditional healers. *Gullah herbal medicines are similar to traditional African remedies. *The Gullah \\"seekin\\" ritual is similar to coming of age ceremonies in West African secret societies, such as the Poro and Sande. *The Gullah ring shout is similar to ecstatic religious rituals performed in West and Central Africa. *Gullah stories about \\"Bruh Rabbit\\" are similar to West and Central African trickster tales about the figures of the clever and conniving rabbit, spider, and tortoise. *Gullah spirituals, shouts, and other musical forms employ the \\"call and response\\" method commonly used in African music. *Gullah \\"sweetgrass baskets\\" are coil straw baskets made by the descendants of slaves in the South Carolina Lowcountry. They are nearly identical to traditional coil baskets made by the Wolof people in Senegal. *Gullah \\"strip quilts\\" mimic the design of cloth woven with the traditional strip loom used throughout West Africa. Kente cloth from the Ashanti and the Ewe peoples, as well as Akwete cloth from the Igbo people are woven on the strip loom. * A non-English song, preserved by a Gullah family in coastal Georgia, was analyzed in the 1940s by linguist Lorenzo Turner and found to be a Mende song from Sierra Leone. It is probably the longest text in an African language to survive the transatlantic crossing of enslaved Africans to the present-day United States. Later, in the 1990s, researchers Joseph Opala, Cynthia Schmidt, and Taziff Koroma located a village in Sierra Leone where the song is still sung, and determined it is a funeral hymn. This research and the resulting reunion between Gullah and Mende families is recounted in the documentary The Language You Cry In (1998). * Some words coming from others African languages such as Yoruba, Fon, Ewe, Twi, Ga, Mende, and Bini are still used by Gullah people.  Cuisine  Rice is a staple food in Gullah communities and continues to be cultivated in abundance in the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. Rice is also an important food in West African cultures. As descendants of enslaved Africans, the Gullah continued the traditional food and food techniques of their ancestors, demonstrating another link to traditional African cultures. Rice is a core commodity of the Gullah food system: a meal was not considered complete without rice. There are strict rituals surrounding the preparation of rice in the Gullah communities. First, individuals would remove the darker grains from the rice, and then hand wash the rice numerous times before it was ready for cooking. The Gullah people would add enough water for the rice to steam on its own, but not so much that one would have to stir or drain it. These traditional techniques were passed down during the period of slavery and are still an important part of rice preparation by Gullah people. Celebrating Gullah culture VOA report about an exhibit about Gullah culture Over the years, the Gullah have attracted study by many historians, linguists, folklorists, and anthropologists interested in their rich cultural heritage. Many academic books on that subject have been published. The Gullah have also become a symbol of cultural pride for blacks throughout the United States and a subject of general interest in the media. Numerous newspaper and magazine articles, documentary films, and children's books on Gullah culture, have been produced, in addition to popular novels set in the Gullah region. In 1991 Julie Dash wrote and directed Daughters of the Dust, the first feature film about the Gullah, set at the turn of the century on St. Helena Island. Born into a Gullah family, she was the first African-American woman director to produce a feature film. Gullah people now organize cultural festivals every year in towns up and down the Lowcountry. Hilton Head Island, for instance, hosts a \\"Gullah Celebration\\" in February. It includes \\"De Aarts ob We People\\" show; the \\"Ol‚Äô Fashioned Gullah Breakfast\\"; \\"National Freedom Day,\\" the \\"Gullah Film Fest\\", \\"A Taste of Gullah\\" food and entertainment, a \\"Celebration of Lowcountry Authors and Books,\\" an \\"Arts, Crafts & Food Expo,\\" and \\"De Gullah Playhouse\\". Beaufort hosts the oldest and the largest celebration, \\"The Original Gullah Festival\\" in May. The nearby Penn Center on St. Helena Island holds \\"Heritage Days\\" in November. Other Gullah festivals are celebrated on James Island, South Carolina and Sapelo Island, Georgia. Gullah culture is also being celebrated elsewhere in the United States. The High Art Museum in Atlanta has presented exhibits about Gullah culture. The Black Cultural Center at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana conducted a research tour, cultural arts festival, and other related events to showcase the Gullah culture. The Black Cultural Center Library maintains a bibliography of Gullah books and materials, as well. Metro State College in Denver, Colorado recently hosted a conference on Gullah culture, called The Water Brought Us: Gullah History and Culture, which featured a panel of Gullah scholars and cultural activists. These events in Indiana and Colorado are typical of the attention Gullah culture regularly receives throughout the United States. Cultural survival Gullah culture has proven to be particularly resilient. Gullah traditions are strong in the rural areas of the Lowcountry mainland and on the Sea Islands, and among their people in urban areas such as Charleston and Savannah. Gullah people who have left the Lowcountry and moved far away have also preserved traditions; for instance, many Gullah in New York, who went North in the Great Migration of the first half of the 20th century, have established their own neighborhood churches in Harlem, Brooklyn, and Queens. Typically they send their children back to rural communities in South Carolina and Georgia during the summer months to live with grandparents, uncles, and aunts. Gullah people living in New York frequently return to the Lowcountry to retire. Second- and third-generation Gullah in New York often maintain many of their traditional customs and sometimes still speak the Gullah language. The Gullah custom of painting porch ceilings haint blue to deter haints, or ghosts, survives in the American South. Having also been adopted by White Southerners, it has lost some of its spiritual significance.

The film is about an upper class Bengali family on vacation in Darjeeling, a popular hill station and resort, near Kanchenjunga. Narrative structure The structure of the film contrasts a primary plot with a secondary plot. The secondary plot involves two characters, largely static, and is played out in scenes involving only them. The primary plot pulls in most of the characters, in various groups coming together and breaking apart, across many different locations, as they all walk the circular path rising and falling over the mountainside. The film happens in linear realtime, i.e. the runtime of the film covers events happening over approximately the same period. However frequent inter-cutting between the different groups fractures this linearity, as does the thematically opposed trajectories of the two plots, one proceeding from family to the individual while the other proceeds from the individual to the family. However there are elements cutting across this chopped up structure. The youngest child of the family, riding in circles and singing a counting rhyme, keeps moving across the background of the scenes like a metronome. The shifting states of weather are a constant backdrop, anchoring everything in time. In the end the climax of all trajectories is capped by the snowy peaks of Kanchenjungha finally appearing out of the clouds, suggesting an underlying unity of everybody's private struggles and their resolutions.  Plot  A wealthy family from Calcutta is on the last day of their vacation in Darjeeling, a hill station at the foot of Mount Kanchenjungha, the second highest peak of the Himalayas. Until now, they have been unable to catch a glimpse of the peak Kanchenjungha. The family members are dominated by the father, Indranath (Chhabi Biswas), an industrialist. He wants his daughter to marry a man of his choice and hopes that the man will propose if they are left together alone for some time. Several long walks and long conversations form the main body of the film. The real-time drama unfolds the daughter's feelings about her father's idea, and the negative reactions to this by her mother and others. By accident, she meets an outsider, Ashoke, a young student who has refused a job offer from Indranath. Though nothing develops between them, his presence coupled with the setting of mountains and the failure of her sister's marriage prompts her to reject the proposed suitor. At the end of his walk, the industrialist arrives at a rendezvous point, expecting to meet his family and the successful suitor. None of them is present to greet him. As the mist clears, the peak of Kanchenjungha is revealed in its full glory. But Indranath is too pre-occupied to admire it. Comments Kanchenjungha was Ray's first original screenplay and for the first time, he was shooting in color. The film shows about 100 minutes (in real time) in the life of a group of rich Bengalis on vacation. Unlike the usual Ray films, it has a linear narrative with no central characters, and no straight narrative in the classical sense. It is a very structured and composed film that uses color and nature to heighten the drama. Ray told his biographer Andrew Robinson: \\"The idea was to have the film starting with sunlight. Then clouds coming, then mist rising, and then mist disappearing, the cloud disappearing, and then the sun shining on the snow- peaks. There is an independent progression to Nature itself, and the story reflects this.\\" As the weather becomes misty - the young daughter and the suitor part at that point, Indranath meets Ashoke, and the elder daughter, Anima and her husband have a bitter moment between them. And then when the sun appears again - Anima's daughter comes back to her parents and they accept her, the misunderstanding is cleared up, and the younger daughter and Ashoke develop a tentative relationship with a hint of future prospects.  Notes  The characters and the Nature are interrelated in mood. In his later film Asani Sanket (Distant Thunder, 1973), Ray attempted quite the opposite. While the Nature is shown in its full glory and lushness, in contrast, the characters starve and do inhuman things. As the characters do not change the clothes during the film (it being depiction of a real time event that happens in 100 odd minutes), the colors of clothes too add a dimension to the characters. About Kanchenjungha, Ray told in an interview to Cineaste magazine, \\"(It was) a very personal film. It was a good ten to fifteen years ahead of its time... Kanchenjungha told the story of several groups of characters and it went back and forth. ... It's a very musical form, but it wasn't liked. The reaction was stupid. Even the reviews were not interesting. But, looking back now, I find that it is a very interesting film.\\" Cast *Chhabi Biswas: Indranath Roy *Karuna Banerjee: Labanya, wife *Anil Chatterjee: Anil, son *Alaknanda Roy: Monisha, unmarried daughter *Anubha Gupta: Anima, elder daughter *Arun Mukherjee: Ashoke, young man from Calcutta *Subrata Sen: Sankar *Sibani Singh: Tuklu *Vidya Singh: Anil's girlfriend *Pahari Sanyal: Jagadish *N.

This bird is endemic to Sri Lanka. This passerine is typically found in forest and cultivation. The Sri Lanka myna builds a nest in a hole. The normal clutch is two eggs. These 25 cm long birds have green-glossed black plumage, purple-tinged on the head and neck. There are large white wing patches, which are obvious in flight. The strong legs are bright yellow, and there are yellow wattles on the nape. The different shape and position of the wattles and the stouter orange-red bill distinguish this species from the Southern hill myna, which also occurs in Sri Lankan forests. The sexes are similar in plumage, but can be distinguished by iris color, which is pale in females and dark in males. Juveniles have a duller bill and smaller wattles, and are less glossy overall. Like most starlings, the Sri Lanka myna is fairly omnivorous, eating fruit, nectar and insects. In culture In Sri Lanka, this bird is known in many names including Sela lihiniya, Mal kawadiya, Kampatiya in the Sinhala language. The name Sela Lihiniya is often mentioned in poems and other similar literature and is quoted for its melodious calls. This bird appears in a 10 rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp.http://www.birdtheme.org/country/srilanka.html It is also the media icon of Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation.

Born in Scotland and raised in Germany, Mackay was the author of Die Anarchisten (The Anarchists, 1891) and Der Freiheitsucher (The Searcher for Freedom, 1921). Mackay was published in the United States in his friend Benjamin Tucker's magazine, Liberty. Life Mackay was born in Greenock on 6 February 1864. His mother came from a prosperous Hamburg family. His father was a Scottish marine insurance broker who died when the child was less than two years old, at which point mother and son returned to Germany, where Mackay grew up.* Mackay lived in Berlin from 1896 onwards, and became a friend of scientist and Gemeinschaft der Eigenen co-founder Benedict Friedlaender. Mackay died in Stahnsdorf on 16 May 1933, ten days after the Nazi book burnings at the Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft. Adolf Hitler had become Reichskanzler on 30 January 1933, and soon all activities of the German homosexual emancipation movement ceased. Allegations that Mackay's death may have been a suicide have been disputed: Writing and influence  Political philosophy  During a one-year stay in London (1887/88) he discovered the works of Max Stirner, whose book The Ego and its Own had merely been forgotten in the second half of the 19th century. Stirner soon became his life's topic. He lifted this 19th century philosopher from obscurity by writing the first and to date only biography Max Stirner ‚Äì sein Leben und sein Werk (1898, 1910, exp. 1914), which, however, was occasionally criticized for lack of source references and its often perceived as hagiographic tone. Because Mackay became Stirner's most famous follower, it fed the impression that his conception of individualistic anarchism, which he presented in his \\"Books of Freedom\\" (The Anarchists, The Searcher for Freedom), was based on Stirner's ideas. There is however also a correspondence with ideas of writers like Thomas Jefferson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and others, like the radical liberalism of his friend Benjamin Tucker.  Sexual orientation and society  Using the pseudonym Sagitta, Mackay wrote a series of works for pederastic emancipation, titled Die B√ºcher der namenlosen Liebe (Books of the Nameless Love). This series was conceived in 1905 and completed in 1913.\\"Richard Strauss and John Henry Mackay\\" by Hubert Kennedy. Thamyris 2. Under his real name he also published fiction, such as Der Schwimmer (1901) and, again as Sagitta, he published a pederastic novel of the Berlin boy-bars, Der Puppenjunge (literally \\"The Boy-Doll\\", but published in English as The Hustler) (1926). In a note to the American publisher of this book, Christopher Isherwood said, \\"It gives a picture of the Berlin sexual underworld early in this century which I know, from my own experience, to be authentic.\\" Richard Strauss's well-known songs from his Vier Lieder (Op. 27), a wedding gift to his wife in 1894, include settings to music of two of Mackay's poems: \\"Morgen!\\" and \\"Heimliche Aufforderung\\". Other uses of Mackay's poems by Strauss include \\"Verf√ºhrung\\" (Op. 33 No. 1) and \\"In der Campagna\\" (Op. 41 No. 2). Arnold Schoenberg set music to his poem \\"Am Wegrand\\".

The first recorded European sighting of the islands now known as the Turks and Caicos occurred in 1512.\\"World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples ‚Äì Turks and Caicos Islands : Overview\\". Minority Rights Group International, 2007. In the subsequent centuries, the islands were claimed by several European powers with the British Empire eventually gaining control. For many years the islands were governed indirectly through Bermuda, the Bahamas, and Jamaica. When the Bahamas gained independence in 1973, the islands received their own governor, and have remained a separate autonomous British Overseas Territory since. In August 2009, the United Kingdom suspended the Turks and Caicos Islands' self-government following allegations of ministerial corruption. Home rule was restored in the islands after the November 2012 elections.  Pre-colonial history  Long before Christopher Columbus first set foot on the capital island of Grand Turk during his discovery voyage of the new world in 1492, the islands of the Turks and Caicos were inhabited by Taino and Lucayan peoples. These original settlers left a rich heritage of seafaring, salt raking and farming, which still lingers on today. Words such as \\"canoe\\", Caribbean and \\"caicos\\" are derived from the Arawak language. Even the name of the country comes from these earliest inhabitants. Turks is a reference to the indigenous Turk's head cactus and Caicos is from the Lucayan term \\"caya hico\\" meaning string of islands, words which entered the natives' language through an early colonist, Bernard Caicos.http://staciesteensland.com/name-origin-of-the-turks-and-caicos/ For almost 700 years, the Taino and Lucayan were the sole residents of the islands, settling mainly in Middle Caicos and Grand Turk. They lived peacefully and were skilled in farming, fishing and gardening. They cultivated almost 50 types of plants, some of which can still be found on undeveloped sections of the islands. Another peculiarity that has been passed down through the generations is a love of shellfish, particularly conch ‚Äì which is actually available in abundance to this day, thanks to the work of the Caicos Conch farm, the only commercial conch farm in the world. Colonial history prior to settlement Caicos islands on a 1727 map by Am√©d√©e-Fran√ßois Frezier Turks and Caicos, north of Hispaniola, on a 1780 map by Rigobert Bonne Shortly after Columbus arrived in 1492, the Lucayan civilization disappeared and the islands remained sparsely populated for about 30 years. During this time, the salt making industry was born. Bermudians came to Turks and Caicos to rake the salt and take it back to Bermuda. Salt was a precious commodity back then as it was used for preserving food. The shallow waters surrounding the islands were ideal for salt raking but treacherous for nautical navigation and more than 1000 ships were wrecked during the journey to and from. The first recorded European sighting of the islands now known as the Turks and Caicos occurred in 1512. During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, the islands passed from Spanish, to French, to English (subsequently British) control, but none of the three powers ever established any settlements. In 1709, an early British colonist, Bernard Caicos, of apocryphal Turkish ancestry, settled on the island. His surname and stories of his alleged Ottoman heritage soon lent the islands their present name among latter colonisers of the islands.http://turksandcaicostourism.com/about-turks-and-caicos/turks-and- caicos-history-culture/ From about 1690 to 1720, pirates hid in the cays of the Turks and Caicos Islands, attacking Spanish treasure galleons en route to Spain from Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Spanish possessions in Central America and Peru. The islands were not fully colonised until 1681, when salt collectors from Bermuda built the first permanent settlement on Grand Turk Island. The salt collectors were drawn by the shallow waters around the islands that made salt mining a much easier process than in Bermuda. They occupied the Turks only seasonally, for six months a year, however, returning to Bermuda when it was no longer viable to rake salt. Their colonization established the British dominance of the archipelago that has lasted into the present day. Huge numbers of trees were felled by the Bermudians to discourage rainfall that would adversely affect the salt mining operation. This deforestation has yet to be repaired. Most of the salt mined in the Turks and Caicos Islands was sold through Bermudian merchant houses on the American seaboard, including in Newfoundland where it was used for preserving cod. The agricultural industry sprung up in the islands in the late 1780s after 40 Loyalists arrived after the end of the American Revolution, primarily from Georgia and South Carolina. Granted large tracts of land by the British government to make up for what they lost in the American colonies, the Loyalists imported well over a thousand slaves and planted vast fields of sisal, harvested for its stiff fibre used in making various products such as rope. Though in the short term highly successful, the cotton industry quickly went into decline, with hurricanes and pests destroying many crops. Though a few of the former cotton magnates changed to salt mining, just about every one of the original Loyalists had left the islands by 1820, leaving their slaves to live a subsistence lifestyle through fishing and hunter-gathering. Bermudian century Raking salt on a 1938 postage stamp of the islands. In 1706, the French and the Spanish briefly captured the Turks and Caicos Islands from the Bermudians. Four years later the British reclaimed the islands for Bermuda but in subsequent years the place became primarily a haven for pirates and British Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution. Ultimately, Britain retained the island country by the end of the century as part of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1766, after being controlled by the Spanish, French and British, Turks and Caicos became part of the Bahamas colony and was placed under the Bahamian government. Attempts to integrate the two distinct communities failed and in 1874 after \\"the Great Bahamas Hurricane\\" devastated much of the chain of islands, the Turks & Caicos Islands became dependencies to the British Crown Colony of Jamaica. Bermuda spent much of the 18th Century in a protracted legal battle with the Bahamas (which had itself been colonised by Bermudian Puritans in 1647) over the Turks Islands. Under British law, no colony could hold colonies of its own. The Turks Islands were not recognised by Britain either as a colony in its own right, or as a part of Bermuda. They were held to be, like rivers in Britain, for the common use. As a result, there was a great deal of political turmoil surrounding the ownership of the Turks (and Caicos). Spanish and French forces seized the Turks in 1706, but Bermudian forces expelled them four years later in what was probably Bermuda's only independent military operation. The Bermudian privateer, the Rose, under the command of Captain Lewis Middleton, attacked a Spanish and a French privateer holding a captive English vessel. Defeating the two enemy vessels, the Rose then cleared out the thirty-man garrison left by the Spanish and French.Maritimes: The Magazine of the Bermuda Maritime Museum. 2002. Vol. 15, No. 2. \\"Foreign Interlopers at Bermuda's Turks Islands\\", by Dr. Bill Cooke. A virtual state-of-war existed between Bermuda and the Bahamas through much of the Eighteenth Century. When the Bermudian sloop Seaflower was seized by the Bahamians in 1701, the response of Bermuda Governor Bennett was to issue letters-of-marque to Bermudians vessels. The legal struggle with the Bahamas began in 1766, when the King's representative in the Bahamas, Andrew Symmer, on his own authority, wrote a constitution which legislated for and taxed the Bermudians on the Turks. The Secretary of State, Lord Hillsborough, for the Crown, issued orders that the Bermudian activities on the Turks should not be obstructed or restrained in any way. As a result of this order, Symmer's constitution was dissolved. The Bermudians on the Turks appointed commissioners to govern themselves, with the assent of the King's local agent. They drew up regulations for good government, but the Bahamian governor Shirley drew up his own regulations for the Turks and ordered that no one might work at salt raking who had not signed assent to his regulations. Following this, a raker was arrested and the salt pans were seized and divided by force. The Bahamas government attempted to appoint judicial authorities for the Turks in 1768, but these were refused by the Bermudians. In 1773 the Bahamian government passed an act attempting to tax the salt produced in the Turks, but the Bermudians refused to pay it. In 1774, the Bahamians passed another, similar act, and this they submitted for the Crown's assent. The Crown passed this act on to the Bermudian government which objected to it, and which rejected Bahamian jurisdiction over the Turks. The Crown, as a consequence, refused assent of the Act as applied to include the Turks, and, in the form in which it finally passed, the Bahamas, but not the Turks, were included. The Bermudians on the Turks continued to be governed under their own regulations, with the assent of the royal agent, until 1780, when a more formal version of those regulations was submitted for the assent of the Crown, which was given. Those regulations, issued as a royal order, stated that all British subjects had the right (\\"free liberty\\") to rake and gather salt on the Turks, providing that they conformed to the regulations, which expressly rejected Bahamian jurisdiction over the Turks. Despite this refutation by a higher authority of their right to impinge upon Bermudian activities on the Turks, the Bahamian government continued to harass the Bermudians (unsurprisingly, given the lucrativeness of the Turks salt trade). Although the salt industry on the Turks had largely been a Bermudian preserve, it had been seen throughout the 17th century as the right of all British subjects to rake there, and small numbers of Bahamians had been involved. In 1783, the French landed a force on Grand Turk which a British force of 100 men, under then-Captain Horatio Nelson, was unable to dislodge. Following this, the Bahamians were slow to return to the Turks, while the Bermudians quickly resumed salt production, sending sixty to seventy-five ships to the Turks each year, during the six months that salt could be raked. Nearly a thousand Bermudians spent part of the year on the Turks engaged in salt production, and the industry became more productive. The Bahamas, meanwhile, was incurring considerable expense in absorbing loyalist refugees from the now-independent American colonies, and returned to the idea of taxing Turks salt for the needed funds. The Bahamian government ordered that all ships bound for the Turk Islands obtain a license at Nassau first. The Bermudians refused to do this. Following this, Bahamian authorities seized the Bermuda sloops Friendship and Fanny in 1786. Shortly after, three Bermudian vessels were seized at Grand Caicos, with $35,000 worth of goods salvaged from a French ship. French privateers were becoming a menace to Bermudian operations in the area, at the time, but the Bahamians were their primary concern. The Bahamian government re-introduced a tax on salt from the Turks, annexed them to the Bahamas, and created a seat in the Bahamian parliament to represent them. The Bermudians refused these efforts also, but the continual pressure from the Bahamians had a degrative effect on the salt industry. In 1806, the Bermudian customs authorities went some way toward acknowledging the Bahamian annexation when it ceased to allow free exchange between the Turks and Bermuda (this affected many enslaved Bermudians, who, like the free ones, had occupied the Turks only seasonally, returning to their homes in Bermuda after the year's raking had finished). That same year, French privateers attacked the Turks, burning ships and absconding with a large sloop. The Bahamians refused to help, and the Admiralty in Jamaica claimed the Turks were beyond his jurisdiction. Two hurricanes, the first in August, 1813, the second in October, 1815, destroyed more than two-hundred buildings, significand salt stores, and sank many vessels. By 1815, the United States, the primary client for Turks salt, had been at war with Britain (and hence Bermuda) for three years, and had established other sources of salt. With the destruction wrought by the storm, and the loss of market, many Bermudians abandoned the Turks, and those remaining were so distraught that they welcomed the visit of the Bahamian governor in 1819. The British government eventually assigned political control to the Bahamas, which the Turks and Caicos remained a part of until the 1840s. One Bermudian salt raker, Mary Prince, however, was to leave a scathing record of Bermuda's activities there in The History of Mary Prince, a book which helped to propel the abolitionist cause to the 1834 emancipation of slaves throughout the Empire. Bahamian and Jamaican jurisdictions 1852 lighthouse on Grand Turk The islands remained part of the Bahamas until 1848, when the inhabitants successfully petitioned to be made a separate colony governed by a council president under the supervision of the governor of Jamaica. This arrangement proved to be a financial burden. In 1873, the islands were annexed to Jamaica with a commissioner and a Legislative Board; in 1894, the chief colonial official was restyled commissioner. In 1917, Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden suggested that the Turks and Caicos join Canada, but this suggestion was rejected by British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The islands remained a dependency of Jamaica. The islands remained a dependency of Jamaica until 1959, when they received their own administration under an administrator, although the governor of Jamaica remained the governor of the islands. When Jamaica was granted independence from Britain in August 1962, the Turks and Caicos Islands became a crown colony. From 1965 the governor of The Bahamas was also governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands and oversaw affairs for the islands. Replica of Friendship 7 at Grand Turk Airport From 1950 to 1981, the United States had a missile tracking station on Grand Turk. In the early days of the American space program, NASA used it. After his three earth orbits in 1962, American astronaut John Glenn successfully landed in the nearby ocean and was brought back ashore to Grand Turk island. The salt industry, along with small sponge and hemp exports, sustained the Turks and Caicos Islands (only barely, however; there was little population growth and the economy stagnated) until in the 1960s American investors arrived on the islands and funded the construction of an airstrip on Provo Island and built the archipelago's first hotel, \\"The Third Turtle\\". A small trickle of tourists began to arrive, supplementing the salt economy. Club Med set up a resort at Grace Bay soon after. In the 1980s, Club Med funded an upgrading of the airstrip to allow for larger aircraft, and since then, tourism has been gradually on the increase. It is common for foreign couples to be married in the Turks and Caicos Islands today. Autonomy When the Bahamas gained independence in 1973, the Turks and Caicos received their own governor (the last administrator was restyled). In 1974, Canadian New Democratic Party MP Max Saltsman tried to use his Private Member's Bill for legislation to annex the islands to Canada, but it did not pass in the House of Commons of Canada. The islands adopted their first constitution on 30 August 1976, which is Constitution Day, the national holiday. Since then, the islands have had their own government headed by a chief minister (now premier). The winning party of Turks and Caicos' first general election in 1976, the People's Democratic Movement (PDM) under \\"Jags\\" McCartney, sought to establish a framework and accompanying infrastructure in the pursuit of an eventual policy of full independence for the islands. However, with the early death of McCartney, confidence in the country's leadership waned. In 1980, the ruling pro-independence party, the People's Democratic Movement (PDM), agreed with the British government that independence would be granted in 1982 if the PDM was reelected in the elections of that year. That election was effectively a referendum on the independence issue. The PDM lost the elections to the Progressive National Party (PNP), which supported continued British rule. The PNP's leader, Norman Saunders, became chief minister, and won again the 1984 elections. With these developments, the independence issue largely faded from the political scene. However, in 1985 Saunders and two associates were convicted in the USA on drug charges. The PNP emerged victorious from the following by-elections, but on 24 July 1986, the governor dissolved the government and replaced it with an advisory council after a report on allegations of arson and fraud found that the chief minister post-Saunders, Nathaniel Francis, along with four other PNP officials were unfit to rule. The constitution was suspended in 1986, but restored and revised 5 March 1988. In the interim two Advisory Councils took over with members from the Progressive National Party (PNP), People's Democratic Movement (PDM) and National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which was a splinter group from the PNP: * 1st Council (1986‚Äì1987) ** Ariel Misick (NDA) ‚Äì also served as minister of development and commerce ** Emmanuel Misick (NDA) ** Clement Howell (PDM) ** Carlos Simons (NDA) ** Elliot Williams (PDM) ‚Äì Indigenous Liaison Officer and former Mayor of Cockburn Town. * 2nd Council (1987‚Äì1988) ** Daniel Malcolm (PNP) ‚Äì former leader of PNP ** Tom Lightbourne (PNP) ‚Äì Chairman of PNP ** Herbie Ingham (NDA) ‚Äì later as Providenciales International Airport Authority Chairman Under the careful guidance of the governor and the advisory council, a new constitution of the Turks and Caicos Islands was created and elections held in 1988, with the PNP winning by a landslide, and Washington Misick becoming the new chief minister. Elections in the Turks and Caicos Islands were held on 24 April 2003 and again on 9 February 2007 with the PNP, led by Michael Misick, winning both. The Progressive National Party, led by Michael Misick, held thirteen seats, and the People's Democratic Movement, led by Floyd Seymour, held two seats. A new constitution came into force on 9 August 2006, but was in parts suspended and amended in 2009. Under the 2006 constitution, the head of government was the premier, filled by the leader of the elected party. The cabinet consisted of three ex officio members and five appointed by the governor from among the members of the House of Assembly. The unicameral House of Assembly consisted of 21 seats, of which 15 were popularly elected; members serve four-year terms. However, in the mid-2000s, the issue of independence for the islands was again raised. In April 2006, PNP Premier Michael Misick reaffirmed that his party saw independence from Britain as the \\"ultimate goal\\" for the islands, but not at the present time.\\"Independence 'ultimate goal' for Turks & Caicos, says Chief Minister.\\" Caribbean Net News. 28 April 2006.

On Monday, 16 March 2009, the UK threatened to suspend self-government in the islands and transfer power to the new governor, Gordon Wetherell, over systemic corruption. On 18 March 2009, on the advice of her UK ministers, Queen Elizabeth II issued an Order in Council giving the Governor the power to suspend those parts of the 2006 Constitution that deal with ministerial government and the House of Assembly, and to exercise the powers of government himself. The order, which would also establish an Advisory Council and Consultative Forum in place of the House of Assembly, would come into force on a date to be announced by the governor, and remain in force for two years unless extended or revoked.The Turks and Caicos Islands Constitution (Interim Amendment) Order 2009 SI 2009/701 On 23 March 2009, after the enquiry found evidence of \\"high probability of systemic corruption or other serious dishonesty\\", Misick resigned as Premier to make way for a new, unified government. Politicians were accused of selling crown land for personal gain and misusing public funds. The following day, Galmo Williams was sworn in as his replacement. Misick denied all charges, and referred to the British government's debate on whether to remove the territory's sovereignty as \\"tantamount to being re-colonised. It is a backwards step completely contrary to the whole movement of history.\\" On 14 August 2009 after Misick's last appeals failed, the Governor, on the instructions of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, imposed direct rule on the Turks and Caicos Islands by authority of the 18 March 2009 Order in Council issued by the Queen. The islands' administration was suspended for up to two years, with possible extensions, and power was transferred to the Governor, with the United Kingdom also stationing a supply vessel in between Turks and Caicos. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Chris Bryant said of the decision to impose rule, \\"This is a serious constitutional step which the UK Government has not taken lightly but these measures are essential in order to restore good governance and sound financial management.\\" The move was met with vehement opposition by the former Turks and Caicos government, with Misick's successor Williams calling it a \\"coup\\", and stating that, \\"Our country is being invaded and re-colonised by the United Kingdom, dismantling a duly elected government and legislature and replacing it with a one-man dictatorship, akin to that of the old Red China, all in the name of good governance.\\" Despite this, the civilian populace was reported to be largely welcoming of the enforced rule. The British government stated that they intended to keep true to their word that the country would regain home rule in two years or less, and Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant said that elections would be held in 2011, \\"or sooner\\". Governor Wetherell stated that he would aim to \\"make a clean break from the mistakes of the past\\" and create \\"a durable path towards good governance, sound financial management and sustainable development\\". Wetherell added: \\"In the meantime we must all learn to foster a quality of public spirit, listen to all those who have the long- term interests of these islands at heart, and safeguard the fundamental assets of the Territory for future generations...

He studied economics and business. During secondary school, he developed a love for literature. He was quite restless, having various types of jobs in cities from Antwerp and Brussels to Rotterdam and Paris. During the First World War, he served as the secretary of a national food relief committee in Antwerp. After the war he started his own advertising agency, which he ran until his death.

While living in Rotterdam he wrote Villa des Roses (1913); his most famous work came in the 1920s and 1930s: Lijmen (1924), Kaas (1933), Tsjip (1934) en Het Been (1938), novels with tragic and comic elements. Central themes in his work are business and family life. His style is characterised by detailed descriptions of surroundings and a mild cynicism. In his first books he works with the same characters, giving the readers a familiarity and a sketch of life in Antwerp during the 1930s. His characters Boorman, an entrepreneur always looking for scams and opportunities, and Frans Laarmans, a clerk, evolve through these books.

Its capital was initially located at Temsaman, and then moved to Nekor. The dynasty was founded in 710 CE by Salih I ibn Mansur through a Caliphate grant.

His dynasty, the Ban≈´ SƒÅlih, thereafter ruled the region until 1019. In 859, the kingdom became subject to a 62 ship-strong group of Vikings who defeated a Moorish force in Nekor that had attempted to interfere with their plunderings in the area.

However, the line was resumed (and the city rebuilt) by: *Abu Ayyub Isma'il ibn 'Abd al Malik ibn Abd ar-Rahman ibn Sa'id I ibn Salih (930?-935), who was defeated and killed by yet another Fatimid general, Sandal the mawla. However, when Sandal departed for Fez, installing a governor called Marmazu of the Kutama tribe, the inhabitants rebelled and installed yet another member of the line: *Musa ibn Rumi ibn Abd as-Sami\` ibn Salih ibn Idris I ibn Salih (936?-940), who defeated Marmazu and sent his head to the Umayyad Caliph in Cordoba. However, he was soon exiled by his relative: *Abd as-Sami' ibn Jurthum ibn Idris ibn Salih I ibn Mansur (940-947). His people rose up and killed him, and then sent for one of his relatives from M√°laga: *Jurthum ibn Ahmad ibn Ziyadat Allah ibn Sa'id I ibn Idris (947-970), who adopted the Maliki school of jurisprudence. Thenceforth, the kingdom remained in his line until the Azd√¢ji emir Ya'la ibn Futuh conquered it in 1019 and expelled the family. All dates are converted from Hijri, and may be up to a year out.

In 1882, an additional platform was constructed, after the line was extended to Camberwell. In 1890, an island platform was constructed, using a canopy from the original Flinders Street station, for the newly opened, and now closed, branch line to Kew. A third track was added between Hawthorn and Burnley in 1972, which allows the centre track to be used as a bi-directional track for express services during peak hour, and completed triplication of the line as far as Box Hill. Bulk briquette handling facilities were abolished at the station in 1973. By the mid 1980s, the station was in a dilapidated state, and had not been maintained for many years. In 1984, the State Government, with the Metropolitan Transit Authority (The Met), approved a $300,000 face- lift of the station.

It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Camberwell, opening on 3 April 1882.Camberwell Vicsig It was the terminus of its own line for a few months, until the railway was extended to Lilydale. When the first section of the Outer Circle line opened in 1891, a new station was built at East Camberwell to provide an interchange. However, the Outer Circle line quickly failed, with a number of sections closing, and by 1898, only the Ashburton line remained (later extended to Alamein), and trains for Ashburton began to depart from Camberwell. The station was demolished, and the current Edwardian style station opened in 1919, when the railway lines were placed in a cutting. This was done partly to remove the steep gradient from Auburn, to the west. This length of track was so steep that steam locomotives could not pull a fully laden train between the two stations, requiring peak hour trains to be separated. The locomotive would bring one set of carriages to Camberwell, then return for the other set, causing significant delays. The signal box at Camberwell was the first one in Victoria to have push-button signalling installed, the new technology being commissioned in November 1964. Immediately east of the station the, Alamein line diverges south, with a flyover carrying the southbound line over the Lilydale and Belgrave lines. It was upgraded to a Premium station on 27 April 1996. In 1997, four stabling sidings were built on the site of the former goods yard. They were built to replace sidings removed at Jolimont Yard. The stabling sidings were first proposed by the Metropolitan Transit Authority (The Met) in the mid 1980s. Redevelopment controversy In 2001, the Victorian State Government launched a new Metropolitan Planning Strategy, Melbourne 2030, which proposed intensification of development around public transport nodes, such as railway stations and tram routes, along with limits on such development in residential neighbourhoods. The precinct around Camberwell railway station was identified as one of a number of 'activity centres' earmarked for redevelopment. In March 2003, VicTrack announced plans to develop the airspace over the site, including decking over the station platforms and the adjacent marshalling yard, with 3‚Äì4 levels of car park, and 3‚Äì4 storeys of commercial space. The original plans, involving the station's demolition, led to protests from the local community, receiving a significant amount of media attention, with actor Geoffrey Rush and comedian Barry Humphries publicly backing the campaign, heading a protest march up Burke Road from Camberwell Junction to the station.Rush, Humphries and Drost march to save Camberwell from the Station development\\" Marvellous Melbourne The comedian performed a poem about planners at the rally, and noted that the railway line was sometimes called 'The Orient Express'. To those supporting development of the station, the actions of the protesters have been taken as an example of NIMBYism. The Boroondara Residents Action Group worked with architects McGauran Giannini Soon to provide alternative ideas for developing the air-space over the railway station and yard, that were more in-keeping with their views of community preferences, including a small public plaza and a new public library, with some small-scale shops. Although the station is historic, it is not protected by any of the state's heritage listings for any architectural or cultural reasons, and failed to gain this protection when nominated to the Victorian Heritage Register by local residents groups.Heritage Council rejects Camberwell Station listing ABC News 11 November 2005 In July 2009, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal approved a nine-storey development on the site, provided 14 design modifications were made within 28 days.

Steps were provided between all platforms, to enable passengers to change between services. Between 1915 and 1922, a signal box at the Melbourne end was provided, to control the junction towards Riversdale (on today's Alamein line), as the three tracks though to Camberwell had been reduced to two, to allow the regrading works at Camberwell to proceed.

His name is the French word for tarragon.  Personality   The impulsive misanthrope  Estragon represents the impulsive, simplistic side of the two main characters, much in contrast to his companion Vladimir's careful intellectualism and verbosity. He cares little for appearances, and is mostly concerned with eating and sleeping (much to Vladimir's chagrin). Due to his pessimistic outlook on life, he has abandoned all hope of any alleviation from their suffering, and regards \\"Godot\\" suspiciously. This is perhaps because Estragon has far more to worry about. Of the two, Estragon suffers the most physically. He is kicked by Lucky, takes numerous pratfalls, and is beaten by a gang of thugs every night. He also has great difficulty with his boots. In the first act, they do not fit and cause him pain. At the end of the act, he leaves them on the side of the road in disgust. In the second act, he finds them in the same place, now mysteriously fitting him. This boot focus (in terms of the character being foot centred) may be interpreted as being representative of his lower status (see Vladimir's hat) and his \\"earthy\\" nature (e.g. his love of carrots, radishes, etc.). Estragon has a misanthropic view of humanity: he considers people to be \\"ignorant apes\\" and seems to want them to leave him alone. However, he is very attached to Vladimir (despite occasionally bickering with him): he needs protection, and Vladimir provides it. Estragon is often seen as the child to Vladimir's adult, and as such looks for parental security in him.  The poet  Estragon should not, however, be written off as merely a childish simpleton. He easily matches Vladimir in verbal melee (he delivers the ultimate insult in calling Vladimir a \\"Critic!\\"). He also shows an artistic side, and even claims to have once been a poet. His brief, but evocative, monologue about the \\"maps of the Holy Land\\" is very poetic in nature. He can even quote Shelley (with a slight alteration): Excerpt from Shelley's poem: \\"Art thou pale for weariness/Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth...\\" Estragon's play on it: \\"Pale for weariness...Of climbing heaven and gazing on the likes of us.\\"  Appearance  Estragon is given perhaps the most minimal description in the play. He is only described as wearing \\"rags\\", walking with a limp (that eventually wears off) and being lighter than Vladimir. Because of his rather gluttonous nature, however, he is often played as being short and slightly fat (in comparison to the often tall and lanky Vladimir). His clothes are usually a bit dirtier than Vladimir's as well, and seem to be in far worse condition. This interpretation is best attributed to his total lack of restraint and inhibitions (diving for food, sleeping in ditches, etc.). Many famous actors have taken on the role (especially those of the aforementioned body type), notably Bert Lahr, Sir Ian McKellen and Robin Williams (with Steve Martin as Vladimir). Beckett is even said to have wanted Marlon Brando in one production (with Buster Keaton as Vladimir).  Relatives  In Tom Stoppard's Godot pastiche, Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, the character Rosencrantz closely resembles Estragon.

It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Surrey Hills opening on 13 August 1883.Surrey Hills Vicsig Two trains ran to Lilydale each day and five only to Box Hill. Engineers were initially unwilling to allow trains to stop at Surrey Hills claiming potential difficulties with the gradient, and also that there was not enough traffic to warrant the stop. In April 1883 a deputation asked for Surrey Hills to be a flag station so that passengers wishing to detrain could inform the guard of this at the previous station, while those wishing to join the train could show a red flag or a red lamp at night. By August 1883 trains would stop on request. On 1 September 1883 Surrey Hills station was brought into regular service. Surrey Hills station first appeared in the Victorian Railways Working Timetable on 15 October 1883. The double line came into use on 9 December 1888 when a second platform was provided on the north side of the line. By the 1930s a small goods yard was provided to the south of the station, in what is now a carpark. The connection to the mainline was at the Box Hill end of the station. The signal box and goods yard was removed in 1966 to allow track amplification works to be carried out. The present station building was provided, and the then citybound platform converted to an island platform. Services on the third track from East Camberwell extended though the station to Box Hill in December 1971. Surrey Hills was upgraded to a Premium station in June 2001.

Early hardstyle was typically written at 140 BPM and consisted of overdriven and hard-sounding kick drums, often accompanied by an offbeat bass, known as a \\"reverse bass\\". As the genre grew, the production techniques and songwriting changed to be suited to a more commercial audience. Modern hardstyle can be recognized by its use of synthesizer melodies and distorted sounds, coupled with hardstyle's signature combination of percussion and bass. The genre is particularly known for its harmonic use of kickdrums. Due to the sustained nature of a hardstyle kick, producers are able to play basslines by using only the kick itself, which becomes a distinct bass tone through a series of distortion, equalization and layering (among other methods). Modern hardstyle is faster, produced around 150 BPM. The genre gained commercial acceptance in the 2010s, with hardstyle artists performing on the biggest stages in EDM worldwide. Hardstyle influenced other styles of electronic dance music such as big room house, which began sharing similarities with hardstyle like structures, rhythms, and later, pitching kicks became popular in big room, too. Hardstyle also played a large influence in frenchcore and happy hardcore music, which both became popular in the late 2010s with the hardstyle audience after producers started applying hardstyle production techniques and melodic styles to the genres. History Origins The exact origin of hardstyle cannot be specifically defined because the evolution and mixture of other genres turned hard trance and hardcore into what is now known as early hardstyle. As it progressed, the genre gathered characteristics from other electronic music genres and refined its own sound and identity. Over time, the BPM of hardstyle music increased, from a range of 135 to 150 to a range of 150 to 160. Some hardcore producers brought hardstyle elements back to the hardcore scene, which made modern hardstyle and hardcore very similar and often indistinguishable in some cases, only differing in BPM. The first event credited as a hardstyle event was Qlubtempo, which took place in the year 2000 in Zaandam. Qlubtempo was the first event produced by Q-dance, a Dutch event company which would later go on to produce hardstyle festivals in other countries in Europe, Australia, North America, South America and Asia. In 2001, Q-dance produced the first edition of Qlimax. Q-dance trademarked the term \\"hardstyle\\" on the 4th of July, 2002, after both Qlimax and Qlubtempo proved to be successful. Since its inception, Q-dance has guided the evolution of hardstyle music with its events and is often involved with hardstyle artists on a creative level. In 2003, Q-dance hosted the first edition of Defqon.1. The first few years of hardstyle were characterized by a tempo of around 140‚Äì150 BPM, a distorted kick drum sound, vocal samples, dissonant synth sounds known as \\"screetches\\" and the use of a \\"reverse bass\\", a hard kick distorted offbeat bass within the same beat. Around 2002, more hardstyle labels emerged. Fusion Records (with artists as DJ Zany and Donkey Rollers) and Scantraxx (founded by Dov Elkabas) were the two largest Dutch labels Hardstyle labels in that period. At this point in time, hardstyle artists were primarily from either The Netherlands or Italy. The end of the 2000s saw hardstyle music change to a more melodic sound, pioneered by Headhunterz' releases on Scantraxx. Headhunterz refined a more harmonic variant of hardstyle using pitched kicks, which led to the rapid growth of the hardstyle scene, and opened doors for new producers to create more musically advanced hardstyle music. This style was known as \\"nu-style\\" at the time, and later became \\"euphoric hardstyle.\\" During this period, Hardstyle gained popularity on the internet and the scene became more international, leading artists from other countries to produce hardstyle. Multiple local scenes developed around the world, and in 2008, Q-dance hosted the first Australian edition of Defqon.1. In 2010, Headhunterz became the first hardstyle DJ to reach a position in the DJ Mag Top 100, landing at position 36. In 2012, he reached the 11th position. Euphoric hardstyle From roughly 2010 onwards, the move towards a more melodic emphasis from early hardstyle evolved into the subgenre \\"euphoric hardstyle\\", characterized by highly emotional melodies and heavy pitch-shifting of kicks. Notable euphoric hardstyle producers include Headhunterz, Coone, Atmozfears, D-Block & S-Te-Fan, and Da Tweekaz. Rawstyle Since around 2011, more terms to identify developments of hardstyle were introduced. Rawstyle, is a type of hardstyle influenced from Dutch hardcore or older hardstyle resulting in darker melodies, more dissonant elements and harder kick drums. Notable rawstyle artists include: Ran-D, Sub Zero Project, Rooler, Malice & Radical Redemption.  Euphoric frenchcore  Popularized by Sefa and Dr. Peacock in the late 2010s, euphoric frenchcore combines both hardstyle and frenchcore. Euphoric frenchcore uses hardstyle production techniques at faster tempos, ranging between 180 to 220 BPM. The genre caught on quickly after Sefa released his first album in 2018, and it became common for hardstyle artists to close their sets with euphoric frenchcore tracks. That same year, Headhunterz invited Sefa to play on his radioshow, HARD with STYLE. The following years saw multiple euphoric frenchcore performances on the mainstage of Defqon.1, as well as a euphoric frenchcore anthem for the festival in 2019.  Trapstyle  The trapstyle is a sub-genre of the hardstyle scene linked to the trap which appeared in the mid-2010s DJ Coone evokes the genre in his remix of the Techno track from Yellow Claw, Diplo and LNY TNZ. Dubstyle In early 2010, a new variation in hardstyle, named dubstyledubstyle.nl, Dutch website on dubstyle was introduced. Dubstyle is the name given to the genre fusion of hardstyle and dubstep. Dubstyle tends to have reversed wobble basslines and take the kick styling of hardstyle tracks, while combining them with the rhythm, groove, and dubstep tempo and effects a fusion of elements of hardstyle with a dubstep rhythm, usually a 2-step or a breakstep rhythm. After its initial appearance, Dubstyle did not evolve or progress beyond the mid 2010s.

Life and career He was the only son of Emmanuel-Armand de Vignerot du Plessis- Richelieu and his wife, Louise-F√©licit√© de Brehan. In 1788, he succeeded his father as Duke of Aiguillon. In 1789, as a member of the National Assembly, he became one of the first to ally himself with the Third Estate and to renounce the privileges of the nobility. He became a general in the Republican Army, but had to flee during the Reign of Terror of 1793‚Äì1794. According to Michael Kelly in his Reminiscences, the Duke of Aiguillon was, in 1796, in London with the revolutionaries Charles Lameth and the orator Dupont. He states that the duke had been 'one of the twelve peers of France, who, in former days, had an immense fortune, was a great patron of the arts, and so theatrical that he had a box in every theatre in Paris. He was particularly fond of music, and had been a pupil of Viotti (then leader of the Opera House orchestra, at which Kelly was stage manager).' Kelly introduced them to Richard Sheridan and other friends, though the Duke of Queensberry refused to meet the Duke of Aiguillon. On learning that the Duke of Aiguillon's fortune was entirely lost or sequestered, Kelly arranged for him to make a little money by copying sheet- music, which he did secretly during the day, continuing to attend the theatre in the evening. Eventually, an order came from the Alien Office of the British Government that he and his friends must leave England in two days. The duke went to Hamburg, and was later condemned to be shot. 'They told me that he died like a hero,' wrote Kelly. The duke left his favourite Danish dog in Kelly's care, shedding many tears on parting from it: the animal outlived its master, but pined and died soon afterwards.M. Kelly, ed.

All privately owned property was taken for or contributed to the communes and people were not allowed to cook their own food and instead ate in communal dining halls. The Great Leap Forward, begun in 1958, was a campaign to rapidly modernize by using China's vast labor resources in agricultural and industrial projects. The Leap instead resulted in economic destruction and tens of millions of famine deaths, and had been mostly abandoned by early 1962. Membership in communes was gradually reduced in the early 1960s, with some private property ownership and enterprise again being allowed. The communes continued until being dismantled in the early 1980s under Deng Xiaoping.

Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A. (also known as Kaminski Brigade and earlier as the Russian National Liberation Army - Russkaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya, RONA), an anti-partisan formation made up of people from the so-called Lokot Autonomy territory in the Nazi Germany occupied areas of Russia, which was later incorporated into the Waffen-SS as the S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A.. Older publications mistakenly give his first name as Mieczyslaw.Janusz Marszalec: Z krzy≈ºem ≈õwiƒôtego Jerzego, \\"Polityka\\" nr 31/2001, ss.66-68Davies, Norman, \\"Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw . (2004) / Birth and early life Bronislav (also transliterated German-style as \\"Bronislaw\\") Kaminski was born in Vitebsk Governorate, in the Russian Empire, now in Polotsk District, Belarus. His father was an ethnic Pole from a mixed Polish-Belarusian family and his mother was an ethnic German (later termed Volksdeutsch in Nazi Germany). According to Polish author Janusz Marszalec, Kaminski considered himself a Russian.Janusz Marszalec: Z krzy≈ºem ≈õwiƒôtego Jerzego, \\"Polityka\\" nr 31/2001, ss.66-68 He studied at the Saint Petersburg Polytechnical University then served in the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. After demobilization he returned to the Institute, and after graduation worked at a chemical plant.Janusz Marszalec: Z krzy≈ºem ≈õwiƒôtego Jerzego, \\"Polityka\\" nr 31/2001, ss.66-68 In 1935 he was expelled from the Soviet Union Communist Party, and in 1937 during the Great Purge he was arrested for criticising Stalin's policy of farm collectivisation, as well as working with Germans and Poles. He was accused of \\"belonging to a counter-revolutionary group\\". In 1941 he was released from prison and settled in Bryansk, where he obtained a position as an engineer in the local distillery.  Lokot Republic leader  By October 1941, the German military advance into the Soviet Union reached the area of Lokot near the city of Bryansk, which was itself captured by German forces on 6 October 1941. In November 1941, Bronislav Kaminski, along with his close friend, a local technical school teacher, Konstantin Voskoboinik, approached the German military administration with a proposal to assist the Germans in establishing a civil administration and local police. Voskoboinik was appointed by the Germans as the Starosta (or Mayor) of the \\"Lokot volost\\" and the head of the German-controlled local militia. Kaminski became Voskoboinik's deputy. Working with Heinz Guderian the two collaborators organized a militia of 10,000 armed hands with the aim of crushing the Russian partisans. After the death in combat of Voskoboinik on 8 January 1942, Kaminski took over as Mayor and leader of the militia. In 1942 the militia was named Russian Liberation National Army (R.O.N.A.) (rus. –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –û—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –ê—Ä–º–∏—è), which reached a force of tens of thousands. During this time Kaminski was leader of the Lokot Republic, which had half a million inhabitants in its territory. In mid March 1942, Kaminski's representative at the German Second Panzer Army at Orel assured the commanders that Kaminski's unit was \\"ready to actively fight the guerrillas\\" as well as to carry on a propaganda campaign against \\"Jewish Bolshevism\\" and Soviet partisans. Soon after the commander of the 2nd Army Generaloberst, Rudolf Schmidt, appointed Kaminski Major of the Army Rear Area 532, centered on Lokot. On 19 July 1942, after approval by the Commander of Army Group Centre, Field Marshal G√ºnther von Kluge, Schmidt and the 532 Area commander, Kaminski received a degree of autonomy and nominal self-governing authority, under the supervision of Major von Veltheim and Colonel R√ºbsam. Kaminski was appointed the Chief Mayor of the republic of Lokot, and brigade commander of the local militia. He administered local government and established his own courts, jails and newspaper. Private enterprise was encouraged and collective farming abolished. From June 1942, Kaminski's militia took part in the major action codenamed \\"Operation Vogelsang\\", as a part of Generalleutnant Werner Freiherr von und zu Gilsa's Kampfgruppe (taskforce) Gilsa II. In autumn 1942, Kaminski ordered a compulsory draft into the militia of able-bodied men in the area. Units were also reinforced with \\"volunteers\\" drafted from Soviet POWs at nearby Nazi concentration camps. Kaminski ordered the collection of abandoned (usually because of minor mechanical failures, or lack of fuel) Soviet tanks and armored cars. By November 1942, his unit was in possession of at least two BT-7 tanks and one 76 mm artillery piece. Owing to a lack of military uniform and boots, the Germans provided Kaminski's brigade with enough used uniforms to outfit four battalions. However, by late 1942, the militia of the Lokot Republic had expanded to the size of a 14-battalions brigade, around 8,000 men under arms. By January 1943 the brigade had 9,828 men, including an armored unit with one heavy KV-II, two medium T-34, three BT-7 and two BT-5 light tanks and three armoured cars (one BA-10, two BA-20). The brigade's structure was reorganized in the spring of 1943. After the reorganization, the brigade consisted of 5 regiments with 3 battalions each, an anti-aircraft battalion (3 AA guns and 4 heavy machine guns) and an armored unit. A separate \\"guard\\" battalion was also created, bringing the total brigade strength up to an estimated 12 thousand men. The brigade took part, alongside other German units, in the May‚ÄìJune 1943 Operation ZigeunerbaronOperation Zigeunerbaron (\\"Gypsy Baron\\"). Following this operation, the brigade was part of Operation Citadel, the massive offensive to destroy the Kursk salient. This operation was followed by similar operations, Freisch√ºtzOperation Freisch√ºtz and Tannh√§user,Operation Tannh√§user where the brigade, together with other units under German command, was involved in action against partisans and also took part in reprisal operations against the civilian population. In the summer of 1943, the brigade began to suffer major desertions, due in part to the recent Soviet victories, but also due in part to the efforts of the partisans to \\"turn\\" as many of Kaminski's troops as possible. As a part of these efforts, there were several attempts on Kaminski's life. Each time, Kaminski narrowly avoided death and any captured conspirators were punished by execution. Several German officers passing through Lokot reported seeing bodies hanging from gallows outside Kaminski's headquarters. Fearing a breakdown in command, a German liaison staff was attached to Kaminski's HQ to restructure the brigade and return stability to the unit. According to post-war Soviet estimates, up to 10,000 civilians were killed during the existence of the Kaminski formation in Lokot. In Belarus operation against Soviet partisans in March 1944 After the failure of the German Operation Citadel, Soviet counter offensives forced the brigade to retreat. On July 29, 1943, Kaminski issued orders for the evacuation of the property and families of the RONA brigade and the Lokot authorities. Up to 30 thousand persons (10-11 thousand of them were brigade members) were transferred by the Germans to the Lepel area of Vitebsk in Belarus by the end of August 1943. The brigade, together with \\"evacuated\\" civilians, finally settled in the Lepel area of Vitebsk. This area had active partisans, and the brigade was involved in heavy combat for the rest of the year. During the retreat, desertions from the brigade increased greatly, and the entire formation seemed close to disintegration. When the commander of the Second Regiment, Major Tarasov, decided to join the Soviet partisans with all his regiment (he was offered amnesty if his entire regiment joined the partisans), Kaminski flew to his headquarters and according to one account, strangled him and eight others in front of his men. Despite this, up to 200 people deserted within the following two days. By the beginning of October 1943, the brigade had lost two thirds of its personnel, while still in possession of 12 tanks (8 of them T-34s), one 122 mm, three 76 mm and eight 45 mm artillery pieces. At the end of 1943, after German withdrawal from Russia to Belarus, local Belarus police, Soviet prisoners of war and convicts freed from prison were incorporated into the brigade. The force became part of the Waffen-SS and was formed as Stormtroopers Brigade \\"Kaminski\\". On 27 January 1944, Himmler rewarded Kaminski's \\"achievements\\" by decorating him with the Iron Cross, 2nd Class, and on the same day with the Iron Cross, 1st Class. Bronislav Kaminski and personnel of the Volksheer- Brigade Kaminski\\" operation\\"Fr√ºhlingsfest\\", Belarus, May 1944 On 15 February 1944, Kaminski issued an order for the brigade and Lokot administration to retreat further west to the Dzyatlava area in western Belarus. At this point, the brigade's ranks were replenished by the addition of police forces from Belarus. In March 1944, the brigade was renamed Volksheer-Brigade Kaminski. From 11 April 1944, it was attached to SS-Kampfgruppe von Gottberg, which also included the notorious Dirlewanger unit, and participated in a mass murder and security operations: Regenschauer (up to 7,000 \\"bandits\\" reported as killed), Fr√ºhlingsfest (7,011 \\"bandits\\" reported as killed and 1,065 weapons captured) and Kormoran (7,697 \\"bandits\\" reported as killed and 325 weapons captured). During these operations, local civilians were murdered as \\"suspected partisans\\" or deported as slave laborers, their villages burnt down. In the SS In June 1944, the brigade was absorbed as a part of the Waffen-SS and renamed Waffen-Sturm-Brigade RONA, with Kaminski being given the rank of Waffen-Brigadef√ºhrer der SS, the only man with such rank. As the result of Operation Bagration, the anti-partisan activities of the brigade were halted and its personnel (6-7,000 people, though some sources state 3-4,000) were collected at the SS training camp Neuhammer. Plans were made for a non-German SS Division, and the structure was laid down for the 29.Waffen-Grenadier- Division der SS (russische Nr.1). On August 1, 1944 Kaminski received a new rank - Waffen-Brigadef√ºhrer and Major-General of the Waffen-SS. Warsaw Uprising In 1944 Kaminsky took part in the crushing of the Warsaw Uprising, in the Ochota area, where R.O.N.A. committed many war crimes (murder, rape and robbery). According to respected views, the soldiers committed almost 700 murders though numbering only 1% of German forces at the time of the Warsaw uprising. Kaminski thought himself to have direct authority from the SS commander Heinrich Himmler and he did not want to accept orders from general SS Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, who was in charge of German forces in Warsaw. The Warsaw Uprising began 1 August 1944. On 4 August 1944, a combat-ready regiment of the brigade was ordered to assist in crushing the rebellion. SS- Gruppenf√ºhrer Heinz Reinefarth was placed in charge of Kampfgruppe Reinefarth, a pacification unit which consisted of the Kaminski along with the Dirlewanger and several other Ordnungspolizei and SS rear area units. Hitler personally requested Kaminski's assistance, and the latter obliged by gathering a task force of 1,700 unmarried men and sending them (some sources mentioned that they had four T-34 tanks, one SU-76 and few artillery pieces) to Warsaw as a mixed regiment under field command of Kaminski's brigade chief-of-staff, SS- Sturmbannf√ºhrer Yuri Frolov. Later in 1945 Frolov stated that the regiment had up to 1,600 men and 7 artillery pieces and 4 mortars. Frolov noted in 1944 that Kaminski gave his men permission to loot and many did. Kaminski's brigade soon lost any combat worthiness and Kaminski himself focused entirely on collecting valuables stolen from civilian homes. Perhaps 10,000 residents of Warsaw were killed in the Ochota massacre, most murdered by Kaminski's men. Death Heinrich Himmler used the misconduct of the Warsaw group as a pretext for having Kaminski and his leadership executed after trial by court martial in Litzmannstadt (≈Å√≥d≈∫). They were tried for stealing the property of the Reich, as the stolen property was to have been delivered to Himmler, but Kaminski and his men had attempted to keep it for themselves. Also executed with Kaminski was brigade chief-of-staff Waffen-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Ilya Shavykin. The men of R.O.N.A. were given the false explanation that Kaminski had been killed by Polish partisans. When Kaminski's men rejected this explanation, the Gestapo took Kaminski's car, pushed it into a ditch, shot it up with a machine gun, and smeared goose blood all over it, as evidence. The demoralized unit was soon moved out of town and stationed to the north, far from any partisan activity. The death of Kaminski and the unreliability of his troops as a combat unit brought the plans to expand the Kaminski Brigade to a division to an end. After Kaminski's death, his unit was placed under the command of SS-Brigadef√ºhrer and Generalmajor der Polizei Christoph Diehm.

Description The primary purpose of greaves is to protect the tibia from attack. The tibia is a bone very close to the skin, and is therefore extremely vulnerable to just about any kind of attack. Furthermore, a successful attack on the shin results in that leg being rendered useless, greatly hampering one's ability to maneuver in any way. Greaves were used to counteract this. Greaves usually consisted of a metal exterior with an inner padding of felt. The felt padding was particularly important because, without it, any blow would transfer directly from the metal plating to the shin. History Ancient Greece and Rome During Greek antiquity, greaves (Œ∫ŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒØŒ¥ŒµœÇ) were mentioned in many texts, including Hesiod's Shield of Heracles, Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid. In the Illiad, the Greek forces are commonly referred to as \\"well-greaved Acheans\\" (euknƒìmidas Achaioi, ·ºêœãŒ∫ŒΩŒÆŒºŒπŒ¥ŒµœÇ ·ºàœáŒ±ŒπŒø·Ω∂). While these are primarily mythological texts, they still dealt with warfare and the fact that greaves were mentioned is evidence that they were indeed in use. There are also non-fictional testimonies of their use among Roman light infantry (or hastati) from Polybius up to Vegetius. These greaves are thought to have been mass-produced by the Romans using presses on sheets of metal and then attaching lining, usually leather or cloth. While it is generally assumed that greaves were always worn in pairs, there is evidence that many wore just a single greave on the left or right leg. Many skeletons have been found buried with only a single greave, including gladiators and soldiers. People may have worn a single greave as a sign of status, as opposed to any practical use. Medieval Europe Italian greaves, 15th century Greaves were common until around the 9th century AD, when they largely disappeared from use. The first evidence of their reappearance is in the 1230s or 1250s, most notably the depiction of Goliath in the Trinity College Apocalypse manuscript (c. 1230). The lack of other evidence suggests that they were uncommon at the time. Almost all greaves used at this time are known as schynbalds, or greaves that only protected the shin. Illustrations showing ‚Äúclosed greaves‚Äù, or greaves that protected the entire leg first appear around 1290 and become popular in the 1320s. Closed greaves are made of two plates joined on the outside by hinges and fastening with buckles and straps on the inside. Feudal Japan Japanese greaves, known as suneate, were first introduced during the eleventh century, during the late Heian period. The earliest form consisted of three plates of metal covering the shin. By the Kamakura period (1186‚Äì1333), greaves became a standard part of Japanese armor. Around the Muromachi period (1334‚Äì1572), these took on the form of a splint mounted on a piece of fabric with mail in between the metal splint and fabric, not unlike European greaves. This is the most common form of suneate, termed shino-suneate, and saw continued use throughout the Momoyama period (1573‚Äì1602). Sometimes, cavalrymen used the older three-plate model, known as tsutsu-suneate. Like their European counterparts, most suneate contain leather padding on the interior to reduce the impact of blows and to reduce chafing.

Investigations by revealed that the divergent part of an asymptotic expansion is latently meaningful, i.e. contains information about the exact value of the expanded function. The most common type of asymptotic expansion is a power series in either positive or negative powers. Methods of generating such expansions include the Euler‚ÄìMaclaurin summation formula and integral transforms such as the Laplace and Mellin transforms. Repeated integration by parts will often lead to an asymptotic expansion. Since a convergent Taylor series fits the definition of asymptotic expansion as well, the phrase \\"asymptotic series\\" usually implies a non-convergent series. Despite non-convergence, the asymptotic expansion is useful when truncated to a finite number of terms. The approximation may provide benefits by being more mathematically tractable than the function being expanded, or by an increase in the speed of computation of the expanded function. Typically, the best approximation is given when the series is truncated at the smallest term. This way of optimally truncating an asymptotic expansion is known as superasymptotics.. The error is then typically of the form where is the expansion parameter. The error is thus beyond all orders in the expansion parameter. It is possible to improve on the superasymptotic error, e.g. by employing resummation methods such as Borel resummation to the divergent tail. Such methods are often referred to as hyperasymptotic approximations. See asymptotic analysis and big O notation for the notation used in this article. Formal definition First we define an asymptotic scale, and then give the formal definition of an asymptotic expansion. If \\\\varphi_n is a sequence of continuous functions on some domain, and if L is a limit point of the domain, then the sequence constitutes an asymptotic scale if for every n, :\\\\varphi_{n+1}(x) = o(\\\\varphi_n(x)) \\\\ (x \\\\to L). (L may be taken to be infinity.) In other words, a sequence of functions is an asymptotic scale if each function in the sequence grows strictly slower (in the limit x \\\\to L) than the preceding function. If f is a continuous function on the domain of the asymptotic scale, then f has an asymptotic expansion of order N with respect to the scale as a formal series :\\\\sum_{n=0}^N a_n \\\\varphi_{n}(x) if :f(x) - \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_n \\\\varphi_{n}(x) = O(\\\\varphi_{N}(x)) \\\\ (x \\\\to L) or :f(x) - \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_n \\\\varphi_{n}(x) = o(\\\\varphi_{N-1}(x)) \\\\ (x \\\\to L). If one or the other holds for all N, then we write : f(x) \\\\sim \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n \\\\varphi_n(x) \\\\ (x \\\\to L). In contrast to a convergent series for f, wherein the series converges for any fixed x in the limit N \\\\to \\\\infty, one can think of the asymptotic series as converging for fixed N in the limit x \\\\to L (with L possibly infinite). Examples Plots of the absolute value of the fractional error in the asymptotic expansion of the Gamma function (left). The horizontal axis is the number of terms in the asymptotic expansion. Blue points are for x=2 and red points are for x=3. It can be seen that the least error is encountered when there are 14 terms for x=2, and 20 terms for x=3, beyond which the error diverges. * Gamma function ::\\\\frac{e^x}{x^x\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi x}} \\\\Gamma(x+1)\\\\sim 1+\\\\frac{1}{12x}+\\\\frac{1}{288x^2}-\\\\frac{139}{51840x^3}-\\\\cdots\\\\ (x \\\\to \\\\infty) * Exponential integral ::xe^xE_1(x) \\\\sim \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^nn!}{x^n} \\\\ (x \\\\to \\\\infty) * Logarithmic integral ::\\\\operatorname{li}(x) \\\\sim \\\\frac{x}{\\\\ln x} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{k!}{(\\\\ln x)^k} * Riemann zeta function ::\\\\zeta(s) \\\\sim \\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}n^{-s} - \\\\frac{N^{1-s}}{s-1} - \\\\frac{N^{-s}}{2} + N^{-s} \\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{B_{2m} s^{\\\\overline{2m-1}}}{(2m)! N^{2m-1}} :where B_{2m} are Bernoulli numbers and s^{\\\\overline{2m-1}} is a rising factorial. This expansion is valid for all complex s and is often used to compute the zeta function by using a large enough value of N, for instance N > s. * Error function :: \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}x e^{x^2}{\\\\rm erfc}(x) \\\\sim 1+\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty (-1)^n \\\\frac{(2n-1)!!}{(2x^2)^n} \\\\ (x \\\\to \\\\infty) :where is the double factorial. Worked example Asymptotic expansions often occur when an ordinary series is used in a formal expression that forces the taking of values outside of its domain of convergence. Thus, for example, one may start with the ordinary series :\\\\frac{1}{1-w}=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty w^n. The expression on the left is valid on the entire complex plane w e 1, while the right hand side converges only for w< 1. Multiplying by e^{-w/t} and integrating both sides yields :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\frac{w}{t}}}{1-w}\\\\, dw = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty t^{n+1} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-u} u^n\\\\, du, after the substitution u=w/t on the right hand side. The integral on the left hand side, understood as a Cauchy principal value, can be expressed in terms of the exponential integral. The integral on the right hand side may be recognized as the gamma function. Evaluating both, one obtains the asymptotic expansion :e^{-\\\\frac{1}{t}} \\\\operatorname{Ei}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty n! t^{n+1}. Here, the right hand side is clearly not convergent for any non-zero value of t. However, by truncating the series on the right to a finite number of terms, one may obtain a fairly good approximation to the value of \\\\operatorname{Ei} \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{t} \\\\right ) for sufficiently small t. Substituting x=-\\\\tfrac{1}{t} and noting that \\\\operatorname{Ei}(x)=-E_1(-x) results in the asymptotic expansion given earlier in this article. Properties Uniqueness for a given asymptotic scale For a given asymptotic scale {\\\\varphi_n(x)} the asymptotic expansion of function f(x) is unique.S.J.A. Malham, \\"An introduction to asymptotic analysis\\", Heriot-Watt University. That is the coefficients {a_n} are uniquely determined in the following way: :\\\\begin{align} a_0 &= \\\\lim_{x \\\\to L} \\\\frac{f(x)}{\\\\varphi_0(x)} \\\\ a_1 &= \\\\lim_{x \\\\to L} \\\\frac{f(x) - a_0 \\\\varphi_0(x)} {\\\\varphi_1(x)} \\\\ & \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\ a_N &= \\\\lim_{x \\\\to L} \\\\frac {f(x) - \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_n \\\\varphi_n(x)} {\\\\varphi_N(x)} \\\\end{align} where L is the limit point of this asymptotic expansion (may be \\\\pm \\\\infty). Non-uniqueness for a given function A given function f(x) may have many asymptotic expansions (each with a different asymptotic scale). Subdominance An asymptotic expansion may be asymptotic expansion to more than one function.

It is famous as the first work of literary Surrealism. The authors used a surrealist automatic writing technique. The book is considered Surrealist, rather than Dadaist, because it attempts to create something new rather than react to an existing work. Les Champs magnetiques is characterised by rich textured language that often seems to border on the nonsensical. This is considered a \\"normal\\" result of automatic writing and is considerably more logical than the output from other Surrealist techniques, such as \\"exquisite corpse\\" (a method whereby each of a group of collaborators, in sequence, adds words or images to a composition). A typical paragraph in (an English-language version of) Les Champs magnetiques is: :It was the end of sorrow lies. The rail stations were dead, flowing like bees stung from honeysuckle. The people hung back and watched the ocean, animals flew in and out of focus. The time had come. Yet king dogs never grow old ‚Äì they stay young and fit, and someday they might come to the beach and have a few drinks, a few laughs, and get on with it. But not now. The time had come; we all knew it. But who would go first? The division between chapters was the point where the writers stopped writing at the end of the day. The next chapter was started the following morning. Breton gave many interviews about the creation of the book.

It can also be defined as an epicycloid having a single cusp. It is also a type of sinusoidal spiral, and an inverse curve of the parabola with the focus as the center of inversion. The name was coined by de Castillon in 1741Lockwood but had been the subject of study decades beforehand.Yates Named for its heart-like form, it is shaped more like the outline of the cross section of a round apple without the stalk. A cardioid microphone exhibits an acoustic pickup pattern that, when graphed in two dimensions, resembles a cardioid (any 2d plane containing the 3d straight line of the microphone body). In three dimensions, the cardioid is shaped like an apple centred around the microphone which is the \\"stalk\\" of the apple.  Equations  Generation of a cardioid and the coordinate system used Let a be the common radius of the two generating circles with midpoints (-a,0), (a,0), \\\\varphi the rolling angle and the origin the starting point (see picture). One gets the * parametric representation: :x(\\\\varphi) = 2a (1 - \\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\cdot\\\\cos\\\\varphi \\\\ , :y(\\\\varphi) = 2a (1 - \\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\cdot\\\\sin\\\\varphi \\\\ , \\\\qquad 0\\\\le \\\\varphi < 2\\\\pi and herefrom the representation in * polar coordinates: :r(\\\\varphi) = 2a (1 - \\\\cos\\\\varphi). Introducing the substitutions \\\\cos \\\\varphi= x/r and r=\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} one gets after removing the square root the implicit representation in * cartesian coordinates: :(x^2 + y^2)^2 + 4 a x (x^2 + y^2) - 4a^2 y^2 \\\\, = \\\\, 0 . Proof for the parametric representation A proof can be established using complex numbers and their common description as the complex plane. The rolling movement of the black circle on the blue one can be split into two rotations. In the complex plane a rotation around point 0 (origin) by an angle \\\\varphi can be performed by the multiplication of a point z (complex number) by e^{i\\\\varphi}. Hence the :rotation \\\\Phi_+ around point a is:\\\\quad z \\\\mapsto \\\\quad a+(z-a)e^{i\\\\varphi}, :rotation \\\\Phi_- around point -a is: z \\\\mapsto -a+(z+a)e^{i\\\\varphi}. A point p(\\\\varphi) of the cardioid is generated by rotating the origin around point a and subsequent rotating around -a by the same angle \\\\varphi: :p(\\\\varphi)=\\\\Phi_-(\\\\Phi_+(0))=\\\\Phi_-(a-ae^{i\\\\varphi})=-a+( a-ae^{i\\\\varphi}+a)e^{i\\\\varphi}=a\\\\;(-e^{i2\\\\varphi}+2e^{i\\\\varphi}-1). From here one gets the parametric representation above: : \\\\begin{array}{cclcccc} x(\\\\varphi)&=&a;\\\\;(-\\\\cos(2\\\\varphi)+2\\\\cos\\\\varphi -1) &=& 2a(1-\\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\cdot\\\\cos\\\\varphi && \\\\ y(\\\\varphi)&=&a;\\\\;(-\\\\sin(2\\\\varphi)+2\\\\sin\\\\varphi)&=& 2a(1-\\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\cdot\\\\sin\\\\varphi &.& \\\\end{array} (The following formulae e^{i\\\\varphi}=\\\\cos\\\\varphi+ i\\\\sin\\\\varphi, \\\\ (\\\\cos\\\\varphi)^2+ (\\\\sin\\\\varphi)^2=1, \\\\ \\\\cos2\\\\varphi=(\\\\cos\\\\varphi)^2- (\\\\sin\\\\varphi)^2,\\\\; \\\\sin 2\\\\varphi=2\\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\cos\\\\varphi were used. See trigonometric functions.)  Metric properties  For the cardioid as defined above the following formulas hold: * area A= 6\\\\pi a^2, * arc length L= 16 a and * radius of curvature \\\\rho(\\\\varphi)=\\\\tfrac{8}{3}a\\\\sin\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2} \\\\ . The proofs of these statement use in both cases the polar representation of the cardioid. For suitable formulas see polar coordinate system (arc length) and polar coordinate system (area) ; proof of the area formula: : A=2\\\\cdot \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\int_0^\\\\pi{(r(\\\\varphi))^2}\\\\; d\\\\varphi=\\\\int_0^\\\\pi{4a^2(1-\\\\cos\\\\varphi)^2}\\\\; d\\\\varphi=\\\\cdots =4a^2\\\\cdot\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\pi=6\\\\pi a^2 . ; proof of the arc length formula: :L=2\\\\int_0^\\\\pi{\\\\sqrt{r(\\\\varphi)^2+(r'(\\\\varphi))^2}} \\\\; d\\\\varphi=\\\\cdots=8a\\\\int_0^\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(1-\\\\cos\\\\varphi)}\\\\; d\\\\varphi= 8a\\\\int_0^\\\\pi\\\\sin(\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2}) d\\\\varphi= 16a . ;proof for the radius of curvature: The radius of curvature \\\\rho of a curve in polar coordinates with equation r=r(\\\\varphi) is (s. curvature) ::\\\\rho(\\\\varphi) = \\\\frac{\\\\left[r(\\\\varphi)^2 + \\\\dot r(\\\\varphi)^2\\\\right]^{3/2}} {r(\\\\varphi)^2 + 2 \\\\dot r(\\\\varphi)^2 - r(\\\\varphi) \\\\ddot r(\\\\varphi)} \\\\ . For the cardioid r(\\\\varphi) = 2a (1 - \\\\cos\\\\varphi)=4a \\\\sin^2\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2} one gets :\\\\rho(\\\\varphi)=\\\\cdots=\\\\frac{[16a^2\\\\sin^2\\\\frac{\\\\varphi}{2}]^\\\\frac{3}{2}} {24a^2 \\\\sin^2\\\\frac{\\\\varphi}{2}} = \\\\frac{8}{3}a\\\\sin\\\\frac{\\\\varphi}{2} \\\\ .  Properties  Chords of a cardioid  Chords through the cusp  * C1: chords through the cusp of the cardioid have the same length 4a . * C2: The midpoints of the chords through the cusp lie on the perimeter of the fixed generator circle (see picture) . ; proof for C1: The points P: p(\\\\varphi),\\\\;Q: p(\\\\varphi+\\\\pi) are on a chord through the cusp (=origin). Hence :PQ= r(\\\\varphi) + r(\\\\varphi+\\\\pi) :::=2a (1 - \\\\cos\\\\varphi) + 2a (1 - \\\\cos(\\\\varphi+\\\\pi))=\\\\cdots = 4a . ; proof for C2: For the proof the representation in the complex plane (see above) is used. For the points :P: \\\\ p(\\\\varphi)=a\\\\;(-e^{i2\\\\varphi}+2e^{i\\\\varphi}-1) :Q:\\\\ p(\\\\varphi+\\\\pi)=a\\\\;(-e^{i2(\\\\varphi+\\\\pi)}+2e^{i(\\\\varphi+\\\\pi)}-1) =a\\\\;(-e^{i2\\\\varphi}-2e^{i\\\\varphi}-1), the midpoint of the chord PQ is : M:\\\\ \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(p(\\\\varphi)+p(\\\\varphi+\\\\pi))=\\\\cdots=-a-ae^{i2\\\\varphi} which lies on the perimeter of the circle with midpoint -a and radius a (see picture).  Cardioid as inverse curve of a parabola  cardioid generated by the inversion of a parabola across the unit circle (dashed) * A cardioid is the inverse curve of a parabola with its focus at the center of inversion (see graph) For the example shown in the graph the generator circles have radius a=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}. Hence the cardioid has the polar representation :r(\\\\varphi) = 1 - \\\\cos\\\\varphi and its inverse curve :r(\\\\varphi) = \\\\frac{1}{1 - \\\\cos\\\\varphi}, which is a parabola (s. parabola in polar coordinates) with the equation x=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(y^2-1) in cartesian coordinates. Remark: Not every inverse curve of a parabola is a cardioid. For example, if a parabola is inverted across a circle whose center lies at the vertex of the parabola, then the result is a cissoid of Diocles.  Cardioid as envelope of a pencil of circles  cardioid as envelope of a pencil of circles In the previous section if one inverts additionally the tangents of the parabola one gets a pencil of circles through the center of inversion (origin). A detailed consideration shows: The midpoints of the circles lie on the perimeter of the fixed generator circle. (The generator circle is the inverse curve of the parabolas's directrix.) This property gives rise to the following simple method to draw a cardioid: : 1) Choose a circle c and a point O on its perimeter, : 2) draw circles containing O with centers on c, and : 3) draw the envelope of these circles. ; proof with envelope condition: The envelope of the pencil of implicitly given curves :F(x,y,t)=0 with parameter t consists of such points (x,y) which are solutions of the non-linear system * F(x,y,t)=0, \\\\quad F_t(x,y,t)=0 \\\\; (envelope condition). (F_t means the partial derivative for parameter t. Let c be the circle with midpoint (-1,0) and radius 1. Then c has parametric representation (-1+\\\\cos t,\\\\sin t). The pencil of circles with centers on c containing point O=(0,0) can be represented implicitly by :F(x,y,t)=(x+1-\\\\cos t)^2+(y-\\\\sin t)^2-(2-2\\\\cos t)=0, which is equivalent to :F(x,y,t)=x^2+y^2+2x\\\\; (1-\\\\cos t)-2 y\\\\; \\\\sin t=0\\\\; . The second envelope condition is :F_t(x,y,t)=2x\\\\; \\\\sin t-2y\\\\; \\\\cos t=0 . One easily checks that the points of the cardioid with the parametric representation :x(t)=2(1 - \\\\cos t)\\\\cos t,\\\\quad y(t)=2(1 - \\\\cos t)\\\\sin t fulfill the non-linear system above. The parameter t is identical to the angle parameter of the cardioid.  Cardioid as envelope of a pencil of lines  Cardioid as envelope of a pencil of lines A similar and simple method to draw a cardioid uses a pencil of lines. It is due to L. Cremona: # Draw a circle, divide its perimeter into equal spaced parts with 2N points (s. picture) and number them consecutively. # Draw the chords: (1,2), (2,4), ...., (n,2n),...., (N,2N), (N+1,2), (N+2,4), ...., . (i.e.: The second point is moved by double velocity.) # The envelope of these chords is a cardioid. Cremona's generation of a cardioid ; proof: The following consideration uses trigonometric formulae for \\\\cos \\\\alpha+\\\\cos\\\\beta,\\\\ \\\\sin \\\\alpha+\\\\sin\\\\beta, \\\\ 1+\\\\cos 2\\\\alpha, \\\\ \\\\cos2\\\\alpha , \\\\sin 2\\\\alpha. In order to keep the calculations simple, the proof is given for the cardioid with polar representation r=2(1{\\\\color{red}+}\\\\cos\\\\varphi) (see section Cardioids in different positions). ; equation of the tangent: of the cardioid with polar representation r=2(1+\\\\cos\\\\varphi): : From the parametric representation :x(\\\\varphi)= 2(1+\\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\cos \\\\varphi, : y(\\\\varphi)=2(1+\\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\sin \\\\varphi one gets the normal vector \\\\vec n=(\\\\dot y , -\\\\dot x)^T . The equation of the tangent \\\\dot y(\\\\varphi)\\\\cdot (x -x(\\\\varphi)) - \\\\dot x(\\\\varphi)\\\\cdot (y-y(\\\\varphi))= 0 is: :(\\\\cos2\\\\varphi+\\\\cos \\\\varphi)\\\\cdot x \\\\ + \\\\ (\\\\sin 2\\\\varphi+\\\\sin \\\\varphi)\\\\cdot y = 2(1+\\\\cos \\\\varphi)^2 \\\\ . With help of trigonometric formulae and subsequent division by \\\\cos\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\varphi, the equation of the tangent can be rewritten as: * \\\\cos(\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\varphi) \\\\cdot x + \\\\sin(\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\varphi) \\\\cdot y = 4 (\\\\cos\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\varphi)^3 \\\\quad 0 < \\\\varphi < 2\\\\pi,\\\\ \\\\varphi e \\\\pi . ; equation of the chord: of the circle with midpoint (1,0) and radius 3: For the equation of the secant line passing the two points (1+3\\\\cos\\\\theta, 3\\\\sin\\\\theta), \\\\ (1+3\\\\cos{\\\\color{red}2}\\\\theta, 3\\\\sin{\\\\color{red}2}\\\\theta)) one gets: :(\\\\sin\\\\theta-\\\\sin 2\\\\theta)\\\\cdot x \\\\ + \\\\ (\\\\cos 2\\\\theta-\\\\sin \\\\theta)\\\\cdot y = -2\\\\cos \\\\theta -\\\\sin2\\\\theta \\\\ . With help of trigonometric formulae and the subsequent division by \\\\sin\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\theta the equation of the secant line can be rewritten by: * \\\\cos(\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\theta) \\\\cdot x + \\\\sin(\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\theta) \\\\cdot y = 4 (\\\\cos\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\theta)^3 \\\\quad 0 < \\\\theta < 2\\\\pi . Despite the two angles \\\\varphi , \\\\theta have different meanings (s. picture) one gets for \\\\varphi=\\\\theta the same line. Hence any secant line of the circle, defined above, is a tangent of the cardioid, too: * The cardioid is the envelope of the chords of a circle. Remark: The proof can be performed with help of the envelope conditions (see previous section) of an implicit pencil of curves: :F(x,y,t)=\\\\cos\\\\tfrac{3}{2}t\\\\cdot x \\\\ + \\\\ \\\\sin \\\\tfrac{3}{2}t\\\\cdot y - 4 (\\\\cos\\\\tfrac{1}{2}t)^3=0\\\\ is the pencil of secant lines of a circle (s. above) and :F_t(x,y,t)=-\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\sin\\\\tfrac{3}{2}t\\\\cdot x \\\\ + \\\\ \\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\cos \\\\tfrac{3}{2}t\\\\cdot y +3\\\\cos\\\\tfrac{1}{2}t \\\\sin t=0\\\\ . For fixed parameter t both the equations represent lines. Their intersection point is :x(t)=2(1 + \\\\cos t)\\\\cos t,\\\\quad y(t)=2(1 + \\\\cos t)\\\\sin t, which is a point of the cardioid with polar equation r=2(1+\\\\cos t). thumbCardioid as caustic: light source Z, light ray \\\\vec s, reflected ray \\\\vec r Cardioid as caustic of a circle with light source (right) on the perimeter  Cardioid as caustic of a circle  The considerations made in the previous section give a proof for the fact, that the caustic of a circle with light source on the perimeter of the circle is a cardioid. * If in the plane there is a light source Z on the perimeter of a circle which is reflecting any ray, then the reflected rays within the circle are tangents of a cardioid. ; proof: As in the previous section the circle may have midpoint (1,0) and radius 3. Its parametric representation is :c(\\\\varphi)=(1+3\\\\cos\\\\varphi,3\\\\sin\\\\varphi) \\\\ . The tangent at circle point C:\\\\ k(\\\\varphi) has normal vector \\\\vec n_t=(\\\\cos\\\\varphi,\\\\sin\\\\varphi)^T. Hence the reflected ray has the normal vector \\\\vec n_r=(\\\\cos{\\\\color{red}\\\\tfrac{3}{2}}\\\\varphi,\\\\sin{\\\\color{red}\\\\tfrac{3}{2}}\\\\varphi)^T (see graph) and contains point C:\\\\ (1+3\\\\cos\\\\varphi,3\\\\sin\\\\varphi) . The reflected ray is part of the line with equation (see previous section) :\\\\cos\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\varphi\\\\cdot x \\\\ + \\\\ \\\\sin \\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\varphi\\\\cdot y = 4 (\\\\cos\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\varphi)^3 \\\\ , which is tangent of the cardioid with polar equation :r=2(1+\\\\cos\\\\varphi) from the previous section. Remark: For such considerations usually multiple reflections at the circle are neglected.  Cardioid as pedal curve of a circle  Point of cardioid is foot of dropped perpendicular on tangent of circle The Cremona generation of a cardioid should not be confused with the following generation: Let be k a circle and O a point on the perimeter of this circle. The following is true: * The foots of perpendiculars from point O on the tangents of circle k are points of a cardioid. Hence a cardioid is a special pedal curve of a circle. ; proof: In a cartesian coordinate system circle k may have midpoint (2a,0) and radius 2a. The tangent at circle point (2a+2a\\\\cos\\\\varphi, 2a\\\\sin \\\\varphi) has the equation :(x-2a)\\\\cdot\\\\cos \\\\varphi + y\\\\cdot\\\\sin\\\\varphi = 2a\\\\ . The foot of the perpendicular from point O on the tangent is point (r\\\\cos \\\\varphi, r\\\\sin \\\\varphi) with the still unknown distance r to the origin O. Inserting the point into the equation of the tangent yields :(r\\\\cos\\\\varphi-2a)\\\\cos\\\\varphi + r\\\\sin^2\\\\varphi =2a \\\\quad \\\\rightarrow \\\\quad r=2a(1+\\\\cos \\\\varphi) which is the polar equation of a cardioid. Remark: If point O is not on the perimeter of the circle k, one gets a lima√ßon of Pascal.  The evolute of a cardioid  thumbevolute of a cardioid magenta: one point P, its centre of curvature M and its osculating circle The evolute of a curve is the locus of centers of curvature. In detail: For a curve \\\\vec x(s)=\\\\vec c(s) with radius of curvature \\\\rho(s) the evolute has the representation :\\\\vec X(s)=\\\\vec c(s) + \\\\rho(s)\\\\vec n(s). with \\\\vec n(s) the suitably oriented unit normal. For a cardioid one gets: * The evolute of a cardioid is another cardioid one third as large (s. picture). ;proof: For the cardioid with parametric representation :x(\\\\varphi) = 2a (1 - \\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\cos\\\\varphi=4a \\\\sin^2\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\cos\\\\varphi\\\\ , :y(\\\\varphi) = 2a (1 - \\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\sin\\\\varphi=4a \\\\sin^2\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\sin\\\\varphi the unit normal is :\\\\vec n(\\\\varphi)=(-\\\\sin\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\varphi, \\\\cos\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\varphi) and the radius of curvature :\\\\rho(\\\\varphi)=\\\\tfrac{8}{3}a\\\\sin\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2} \\\\ . Hence the parametric equations of the evolute are :X(\\\\varphi) = 4a \\\\sin^2\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\cos\\\\varphi-\\\\tfrac{8}{3}a\\\\sin\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\cdot \\\\sin\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\varphi =\\\\cdots= \\\\tfrac{4}{3}a\\\\cos^2\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\cos\\\\varphi-\\\\tfrac{4}{3}a \\\\ , :Y(\\\\varphi) = 4a \\\\sin^2\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\sin\\\\varphi+\\\\tfrac{8}{3}a\\\\sin\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2} \\\\cdot\\\\cos\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\varphi\\\\ =\\\\cdots= \\\\tfrac{4}{3}a\\\\cos^2\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\sin\\\\varphi \\\\ . These equations describe a cardioid a third as large, rotated 180 degrees and shifted along the x-axis by -\\\\tfrac{4}{3}a. (Trigonometric formulae were used: \\\\sin\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\varphi=\\\\sin\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\cos\\\\varphi+\\\\cos\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\varphi=\\\\cdots, \\\\ \\\\sin\\\\varphi=2\\\\sin\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\cos\\\\tfrac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\ , \\\\ \\\\cos\\\\varphi= \\\\cdots \\\\ .)  Orthogonal trajectories  orthogonal cardioids An orthogonal trajectory of a pencil of curves is a curve which intersects any curve of the pencil orthogonally. For cardioids the following is true: * The orthogonal trajectories of the pencil of cardioids with equations ::r=2a(1-\\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\ , \\\\; a>0 \\\\ , \\\\ :are the cardioids with equations ::r=2b(1+\\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\ , \\\\; b>0 \\\\ . (The second pencil can be considered as reflections at the y-axis of the first one. See diagram.) Proof: For a curve given in polar coordinates by a function r(\\\\varphi) the following connection to cartesian coordinates hold: : x(\\\\varphi)=r(\\\\varphi)\\\\cos\\\\varphi\\\\ ,\\\\qquad y(\\\\varphi)=r(\\\\varphi)\\\\sin\\\\varphi \\\\qquad and for the derivatives :\\\\frac{dx}{d\\\\varphi}=r'(\\\\varphi)\\\\cos\\\\varphi-r(\\\\varphi)\\\\sin\\\\varphi \\\\ ,\\\\qquad \\\\frac{dy}{d\\\\varphi}=r'(\\\\varphi)\\\\sin\\\\varphi+r(\\\\varphi)\\\\cos\\\\varphi\\\\ . Dividing the second equation by the first yields the Cartesian slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (r(\\\\varphi),\\\\varphi): :\\\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\\\frac{r'(\\\\varphi)\\\\sin\\\\varphi+r(\\\\varphi)\\\\cos\\\\varphi}{r'(\\\\varphi)\\\\cos\\\\varphi-r(\\\\varphi)\\\\sin\\\\varphi}. For the cardioids with the equations r=2a(1-\\\\cos\\\\varphi) \\\\; and r=2b(1+\\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\ respectively one gets: :\\\\frac{dy_a}{dx}=\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\varphi-\\\\cos2\\\\varphi}{\\\\sin2\\\\varphi-\\\\sin\\\\varphi}\\\\quad and \\\\quad \\\\frac{dy_b}{dx}=-\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\varphi+\\\\cos2\\\\varphi}{\\\\sin2\\\\varphi+\\\\sin\\\\varphi}\\\\ . (The slope of any curve is dependent from \\\\varphi only, and not from the parameters a,b !) Hence :\\\\frac{dy_a}{dx}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{dy_b}{dx}=\\\\cdots=-\\\\frac{\\\\cos^2\\\\varphi-\\\\cos^2 2\\\\varphi}{\\\\sin^2 2\\\\varphi-\\\\sin^2\\\\varphi}= -\\\\frac{-1+\\\\cos^2\\\\varphi+1-\\\\cos^2 2\\\\varphi}{\\\\sin^2 2\\\\varphi-\\\\sin^2\\\\varphi}=-1\\\\ . That means: Any curve of the first pencil intersectcs any curve of the second pencil orthogonally. 4 cardioids in polar representation and their position in the coordinate system  In different positions  Choosing other positions of the cardioid within the coordinate system results in different equations.

On the grounds of the Best Western Hotel are a number of timber A-frame chalets. A timeshare (sometimes called vacation ownership) is a property with a divided form of ownership or use rights. These properties are typically resort condominium units, in which multiple parties hold rights to use the property, and each owner of the same accommodation is allotted their period of time. Units may be sold as a partial ownership, lease, or \\"right to use\\", in which case the latter holds no claim to ownership of the property. The ownership of timeshare programs is varied, and has been changing over the decades.  History  The term \\"timeshare\\" was coined in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s, expanding on a vacation system that became popular after World War II.Hapimag's Halcyon Days Developments (2002-07) Retrieved on 2008-01-18 Vacation home sharing, also known as holiday home sharing, involved four European families that would purchase a vacation cottage jointly, each having exclusive use of the property for one of the four seasons. They rotated seasons each year, so each family enjoyed the prime seasons equally. This concept was mostly used by related families because joint ownership requires trust and no property manager was involved. However, few families vacation for an entire season at a time; so the vacation home sharing properties were often vacant for long periods. Enterprising minds in England decided to go one step further and divide a resort room into 1/50th ownership, have two weeks each year for repairs and upgrades, and charge a maintenance fee to each owner. It took almost a decade for timeshares in Europe to evolve into a smoothly run, successful, business venture. The first timeshare in the United States was started in 1974 by Caribbean International Corporation (CIC), based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It offered what it called a 25-year vacation license rather than ownership. The company owned two other resorts the vacation license holder could alternate their vacation weeks with: one in St. Croix and one in St. Thomas; both in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Virgin Islands properties began their timeshare sales in 1973. The contract was simple and straightforward: The company, CIC, promised to maintain and provide the specified accommodation type (a studio, one bedroom, or two bedroom unit) for use by the \\"license owner\\" for a period of 25 years (from 1974 to 1999, for example) in the specified season and number of weeks agreed upon, with only two extra charges: a $15.00 per diem (per night) rate, frozen at that cost for the life of the contract. The contract had a $25.00 switching fee, should the licensee decide to use their time at one of the other resorts. The contract was based on the fact that the cost of the license, and the small per diem, compared with the projected increase in the cost of hotel rates over 25 years to over $100.00 per night, would save the license owner many vacation dollars over the span of the license agreement. Between 1974 and 1999, in the United States, inflation boosted the current cost of the per diem to $52.00, validating the cost savings assumption. The license owner was allowed to rent, or give their week away as a gift in any particular year. The only stipulation was that the $15.00 per diem must be paid every year whether the unit was occupied or not. This \\"must be paid yearly fee\\" would become the roots of what is known today as \\"maintenance fees\\", once the Florida Department of Real Estate became involved in regulating timeshares. The timeshare concept in the United States caught the eye of many entrepreneurs due to the enormous profits to be made by selling the same room 52 times to 52 different owners at an average price in 1974‚Äì1976 of $3,500.00 per week. Shortly thereafter, the Florida Real Estate Commission stepped in, enacting legislation to regulate Florida timeshares, and make them fee simple ownership transactions. This meant that in addition to the price of the owner's vacation week, a maintenance fee and a homeowners association had to be initiated. This fee simple ownership also spawned timeshare location exchange companies, such as Interval International and RCI, so owners in any given area could exchange their week with owners in other areas. Cancellations, or rescission, of the timeshare contract, remain the industry's biggest problems to date; the difficulty has been the subject of comedy in popular entertainment.  Legislation  The industry is regulated in all countries where resorts are located. In Europe, it is regulated by European and by national legislation. In 1994, the European Communities adopted \\"The European Directive 94/47/EC of the European Parliament and Council on the protection of purchasers in respect of certain aspects of contracts relating to the purchase of the right to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis\\", which was subject to recent review, and resulted in the adoption on the 14th of January 2009 on European Directive 2008/122/EC.http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:033:0010:0030:EN:PDF  Established regulations in Mexico  On May 17, 2010, Mexico‚Äôs Ministry of Economy through the General Directorate of Standards established new regulations and requirements for developers of timeshare services. The new regulations are outlined in the Official Mexican Norm (NOM), which consists of a series of official standards and regulations applicable to diverse activities in Mexico. The following institutions were involved during the new standardization: * Mexican Resort Development Association (AMDETUR) * National Fund for Tourism Development (FONATUR) * Federal Consumer Protection Office (PROFECO) * Ministry of Economy (SE) * Secretary of Tourism (SECTUR) NOM is officially called: ‚ÄúNOM-029-SCFI-2010, Commercial Practices and Information Requirements for the Rendering of Timeshare Service\\". It established the following standards: * Marketing companies are not allowed to offer gifts and solicit for prospective timeshare owners without clearly specifying the real purpose of the offer. * The requirements to cancel a timeshare contract must be more practical and less burdensome. * NOM recognizes the privacy rights of timeshare consumers. It is strictly prohibited for the timeshare provider to dispose of the consumer's personal information without written consent. * Verbal promises must be written and established in the original timeshare contract. * The timeshare provider must comply with all obligations written in the timeshare contract, as well as the internal rules of the timeshare resort. * The charges that are intended to be made to the consumer must be plainly and clearing defined on the timeshare application forms, including the membership cost, and all extra fees (maintenance fees/exchange club fees). To make the new regulations applicable to any person or entity that provides timeshares, the definition of a timeshare service provider was substantially extended and clarified. If the timeshare provider does not follow the rules decreed in NOM, the consequences may be substantial, and may include financial penalties that can range from $50.00 to $200,000.00 Methods of use Owners can: * Use their usage time * Rent out their owned usage * Give it as a gift * Donate it to a charity (should the charity choose to accept the burden of the associated maintenance payments) * Exchange internally within the same resort or resort group * Exchange externally into thousands of other resorts * Sell it either through traditional or online advertising, or by using a licensed broker. Timeshare contracts allow transfer through sale, but it is rarely accomplished. Recently, with most point systems, owners may elect to: * Assign their usage time to the point system to be exchanged for airline tickets, hotels, travel packages, cruises, amusement park tickets * Instead of renting all their actual usage time, rent part of their points without actually getting any usage time and use the rest of the points * Rent more points from either the internal exchange entity or another owner to get a larger unit, more vacation time, or to a better location * Save or move points from one year to another Some developers, however, may limit which of these options are available at their respective properties. Owners can elect to stay at their resort during the prescribed period, which varies depending on the nature of their ownership. In many resorts, they can rent out their week or give it as a gift to friends and family.  Exchanging timeshares  Used as the basis for attracting mass appeal to purchasing a timeshare, is the idea of owners exchanging their week, either independently or through exchange agencies.Dana Dratch Trading spaces: buying a time share for travel Bankrate.com The two largest‚Äîoften mentioned in media‚Äîare RCI and Interval International (II), which combined, have over 7,000 resorts. They have resort affiliate programs, and members can only exchange with affiliated resorts. It is most common for a resort to be affiliated with only one of the larger exchange agencies, although resorts with dual affiliations are not uncommon. The timeshare resort one purchases determines which of the exchange companies can be used to make exchanges. RCI and II charge a yearly membership fee, and additional fees for when they find an exchange for a requesting member, and bar members from renting weeks for which they already have exchanged. Owners can also exchange their weeks or points through independent exchange companies. Owners can exchange without needing the resort to have a formal affiliation agreement with the companies, if the resort of ownership agrees to such arrangements in the original contract. Due to the promise of exchange, timeshares often sell regardless of the location of their deeded resort. What is not often disclosed is the difference in trading power depending on the location, and season of the ownership. If a resort is in a prime vacation region, it will exchange extremely well depending on the season and week that is assigned to the particular unit trying to make an exchange. However, timeshares in highly desirable locations and high season time slots are the most expensive in the world, subject to demand typical of any heavily trafficked vacation area. An individual who owns a timeshare in the American desert community of Palm Springs, California in the middle of July or August will possess a much reduced ability to exchange time, because fewer come to a resort at a time when the temperatures are in excess of .  Varieties  Deeded versus right-to-use contracts A major difference in types of vacation ownership is between deeded and right-to-use contracts. With deeded contracts the use of the resort is usually divided into week-long increments and are sold as real property via fractional ownership. As with any other piece of real estate, the owner may do whatever is desired: use the week, rent it, give it away, leave it to heirs, or sell the week to another prospective buyer. The owner is also liable for an equal portion of the real estate taxes, which usually are collected with condominium maintenance fees. The owner can potentially deduct some property-related expenses, such as real estate taxes from taxable income. Deeded ownership can be as complex as outright property ownership in that the structure of deeds vary according to local property laws. Leasehold deeds are common and offer ownership for a fixed period of time after which the ownership reverts to the freeholder. Occasionally, leasehold deeds are offered in perpetuity, however many deeds do not convey ownership of the land, but merely the apartment or unit (housing) of the accommodation. With right-to-use contracts, a purchaser has the right to use the property in accordance with the contract, but at some point the contract ends and all rights revert to the property owner. Thus, a right-to-use contract grants the right to use the resort for a specific number of years. In many countries there are severe limits on foreign property ownership; thus, this is a common method for developing resorts in countries such as Mexico. Care should be taken with this form of ownership as the right to use often takes the form of a club membership or the right to use the reservation system, where the reservation system is owned by a company not in the control of the owners. The right to use may be lost with the demise of the controlling company, because a right to use purchaser's contract is usually only good with the current owner, and if that owner sells the property, the lease holder could be out of luck depending on the structure of the contract, and/or current laws in foreign venues. Fixed-week ownership The most common unit of sale is a fixed week; the resort will have a calendar enumerating the weeks roughly starting with the first calendar week of the year. An owner may own a deed to use a unit for a single specified week; for example, week 51 typically includes Christmas. An individual who owns Week 26 at a resort can use only that week in each year. Floating-week ownership Sometimes units are sold as floating weeks, in which a contract specifies the number of weeks held by each owner and from which weeks the owner may select for his stay. An example of this may be a floating summer week, in which the owner may choose any single week during the summer. In such a situation, there is likely to be greater competition during weeks featuring holidays, while lesser competition is likely when schools are still in session. Some floating contracts exclude major holidays so they may be sold as fixed weeks. Rotating or flex-week ownership Some are sold as rotating weeks, commonly referred to as flex weeks. In an attempt to give all owners a chance for the best weeks, the weeks are rotated forward or backward through the calendar, so in year 1 the owner may have use of week 25, then week 26 in year 2, and then week 27 in year 3. This method gives each owner a fair opportunity for prime weeks, but unlike its name, it is not flexible. Points programs A variant form of real estate-based timeshare that combines features of deeded timeshare with right-to-use offerings was developed by Disney Vacation Club (DVC) in 1991. Purchasers of DVC timeshare interests, whom DVC calls members receive a deed conveying an undivided real property interest in a timeshare unit. Each DVC member's property interest is accompanied by an annual allotment of vacation points in proportion to the size of the property interest. DVC's vacation points system is marketed as highly flexible and may be used in different increments for vacation stays at DVC resorts in a variety of accommodations from studios to three-bedroom villas. DVC's vacation points can be exchanged for vacations worldwide in non- Disney resorts, or may be banked into or borrowed from future years. DVC's deeded/vacation point structure, which has been used at all of its timeshare resorts, has been adopted by other large timeshare developers including the Hilton Grand Vacations Company, the Marriott Vacation Club, the Hyatt Residence Club and Accor in France. Resort-based points programs are also sold as deeded and as right to use. Points programs annually give the owner a number of points equal to the level of ownership. The owner in a points program can then use these points to make travel arrangements within the resort group. Many points programs are affiliated with large resort groups offering a large selection of options for destination. Many resort point programs provide flexibility from the traditional week stay. Resort point program members, such as WorldMark by Wyndham and Diamond Resorts International, may request from the entire available inventory of the resort group. A points program member may often request fractional weeks as well as full or multiple week stays. The number of points required to stay at the resort in question will vary based on a points chart. The points chart will allow for factors such as: * Popularity of the resort * Size of the accommodations * Number of nights * Desirability of the season Types and sizes of accommodations Timeshare properties tend to be apartment style accommodations ranging in size from studio units (with room for two), to three and four bedroom units. These larger units can usually accommodate large families comfortably. Units normally include fully equipped kitchens with a dining area, dishwasher, televisions, DVD players, etc. It is not uncommon to have washers and dryers in the unit or accessible on the resort property. The kitchen area and amenities will reflect the size of the particular unit in question. Units are usually listed by how many the unit will sleep and how many the unit will sleep privately. Traditionally, but not exclusively: * Sleeps 2/2 would normally be a one bedroom or studio * Sleeps 6/4 would normally be a two bedroom with a sleeper sofa (timeshares are sold worldwide, and every venue has its own unique descriptions) Sleep privately usually refers to the number of guests who will not have to walk through another guest's sleeping area to use a restroom. Timeshare resorts tend to be strict on the number of guests permitted per unit. Unit size affects the cost and demand at any given resort. The same does not hold true comparing resorts in different locations. A one-bedroom unit in a desirable location may still be more expensive and in higher demand than a two-bedroom accommodation in a resort with less demand. An example of this may be a one-bedroom at a desirable beach resort compared to a two-bedroom unit at a resort located inland from the same beach. Sales incentives The timeshare will often provide incentives for the prospective buyer to take a tour of the property: * A stay at a vacation resort at a discounted rate (The vacation resort is a timeshare, and a sale is the objective) * Gifts (that may range from luggage to a toaster to a tablet to partial reimbursement towards the cost of the stay) * Prepaid tickets (to a movie, play, or other forms of entertainment available in the general area of the resort) *Gambling chips (usually at a timeshare resort that has legalized gambling) * Various prepaid activities coupons, usually for use in or near the vacation venue *Giftcards or similar pre-paid cards to reimburse a portion of the cost of staying at the resort/location. The vacationing timeshare prospects are presented these incentives in exchange for the promise to the marketing company that they agree to take a timeshare tour before the completion of their stay. If the vacationing prospects refuse to take the tour, they may find the price of their accommodations significantly increased, perhaps be directed to leave the property, and all incentives withdrawn or voided. The tour The prospective buyers (hereby referred to as prospects) are seated in a hospitality room (a term designated by the land sales industry in the 1960s) with many tables and chairs to accommodate families. The prospects are assigned a tour guide. This individual is usually a licensed real estate agent, but not in all cases. The actual cost of the timeshare can only be quoted by a licensed real estate agent in the United States, unless the purchase is a right to use as opposed to an actual real estate transaction via ownership. Since timeshares are sold internationally, these laws vary from venue to venue. After a warm-up period and some coffee or snack, there will be a podium speaker welcoming the prospects to the resort, followed by a film designed to dazzle them with exotic places they could visit as timeshare owners. The prospects will then be invited to take a tour of the property. Depending on the resort's available inventory, the tour will include an accommodation that the tour guide or agent feels will best fit the prospect's family's needs. After the tour and subsequent return to the hospitality room for the verbal sales presentation, the prospects are given a brief history of timeshare and how it relates to the vacation industry today. During the presentation they will be handed the resort exchange book from RCI, Interval International, or whatever exchange company is associated with that particular resort property. The prospects will be asked to tell the tour guide the places they would like to visit if they were timeshare owners. The rest of the presentation will be designed around the responses the prospective buyers give to that question. If the guide is licensed, the prospect will be quoted the retail price of the particular unit that best seemed to fit the prospective buyer's needs. If the tour guide is not a licensed agent, a licensed agent will now step in to present the price. If the prospect replies with \\"no\\", or \\"I would like to think about it\\", the prospect will then be given a new incentive to buy. This incentive will usually be a discounted price that will only be good today (good today only is an untrue statement, and has been used as a sales closing device since day one of the timeshare industry's inception). If again, the reply is \\"no\\", or \\"I would like to think about it\\", the sales agent will ask the prospect to please talk to one of the managers before the prospect leaves. It is at this moment that the prospect realizes that the tour has actually just begun. A sales manager, assistant manager or project director will now be called to the table. This procedure is called: \\"T.O.\\", or getting the turn over man to find an incentive usually in the form of a smaller less expensive unit or a trade in unit from another owner. This tactic is commonly used as a sales ploy, because the resort is not interested in reselling already deeded property. Similar to the automobile sales industry, the manager and salesman know beforehand exactly what the lowest price is that will be offered to the prospect, well before the prospect has arrived for the tour. If one incentive doesn't move a prospect to purchase, another will follow shortly, until the prospect has either purchased, convinced the usually very polite sales crew that no means no, or has gotten up from the table and exited the building. Cancellation of a timeshare contract Timeshare sales are often high-pressure and fast-moving affairs. Some people get caught up in the excitement of the sales presentation and sign a contract, only to realize later that they may have made a mistake. U.S. Federal Trade Commission mandates a \\"cool off period\\" that allows people to cancel some types of purchases without penalty within three days. Additionally, almost all U.S. states have laws that specifically govern cancellation of timeshare contracts. In Florida, a new timeshare owner can cancel the purchase within ten days.http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search;_String=&URL;=0700-0799/0721/Sections/0721.10.html Florida Statutes 721.10. The law differs by jurisdiction as to whether out-of- state purchasers are subject to the rescission period of their state of residence, or the rescission period of the state where the timeshare purchase was made (e.g., in Florida, the 10-day rescission period applies to all buyers; thus, a Texas buyer who would only have five days in Texas, has the whole 10-day period allotted by Florida Statutes). Another common practice is to have the prospective buyer sign a \\"cancellation waiver\\", using it as an excuse to lower the price of the timeshare in exchange for the buyer waiving cancellation rights (or paying a penalty, such as losing 10% of the purchase price, if the sale is cancelled). However, such a waiver is not legally enforceable anywhere in Mexico or the United States. If a recent timeshare buyer wishes to rescind or cancel the timeshare contract, the intent to cancel must be made within the allotted time period in writing or in person; a telephone call will not suffice. In recent years, a timeshare cancellation industry has formed by companies who provide one simple service: timeshare cancellations. However, some of these companies are suspected of being fraudulent. =Reasons for cancellation= It is more than likely that a new timeshare owner could have purchased the same product from an existing owner on the timeshare resale market for drastically less than what the buyer paid from the resort developer, simply by doing a computer search. In many cases, the exact or similar accommodation purchased, will be happily transferred by an unhappy timeshare owner. The new buyer usually pays only minimum real estate transfer fees and agrees to take over the maintenance fees, because the existing owner can't find a buyer for his/her timeshare without paying a resale company thousands of dollars to absorb it for resale. The reason for this anomaly is that the lion's share of the cost of a new timeshare are sales commissions and marketing overhead, and cannot be retrieved by the timeshare owner. Another reason a new owner might want to cancel is buyer's remorse following the subsidence of excitement produced by a sales presentation. He may have realized that he is uncertain what exactly has been purchased and how it works, or may have realized the unlimited duration of a commitment to pay ownership maintenance fees, or may have observed that he knows too little about the timeshare sales company, due to insufficient time during the sales process.  Criticism  The United States Federal Trade Commission provides consumers with information regarding timeshare pricing and other related information. Also known as Universal Lease Programs (ULPs), timeshares are considered to be securities under the law. Many timeshare owners complain about the annual maintenance fee (which includes property taxes) being too high.Sarah Max, \\"The Timeshare Trap\\": Frustrated with fees, timeshare owners struggle to donate, sell or give away vacation property\\" , CNNMoney, March 21, 2002. Timeshare developers contend that pricing compared to staying at hotels in the long term is projected to be lower to the timeshare owner. However, a hotel guest does not have a monthly vacation mortgage payment, upfront cost, fixed schedule, maintenance fees, and preset vacation locations. Many owners also complain that the increasing cost of timeshares and accompanying maintenance and exchange fees are rising faster than hotel rates in the same areas. The industry's reputation has been severely injured by the comparison of the timeshare salesman to the used car salesman, because of the sales pressure put on the prospective buyer to \\"buy today\\". \\"The discounted price I quoted you is only good if you buy today\\", is the industry standard's pitch to close the sale on the first visit to the resort. Many have left a timeshare tour complaining of being exhausted by the barrage of salespeople they had to deal with before they finally exited the tour. The term \\"TO\\", or \\"turn over\\" man, was coined in the land industry, and quickly evolved to the timeshare industry. Once the original tour guide or salesman gives the prospective buyer the pitch and price, the \\"TO\\" is sent in to drop the price and secure the down payment. However, the biggest complaint is that timeshare reselling by the private owner is almost impossible to do. In most cases, an owner looking to sell literally cannot give the timeshare away. Timeshare resale companies have sprung up that actually charge the owner to assume his/her timeshare ownership‚Äîcontending that the resale company must assume the maintenance fees along with marketing fees‚Äîuntil that burden can be transferred to a new buyer.

He is a former chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles, provost of Harvard University, and dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. In November 1994, while serving as dean and provost, Carnesale was appointed acting president of Harvard while President Neil L. Rudenstine was on leave. He served in that position for three months. He has also been active in international diplomacy on nuclear arms control and nuclear non-proliferation. From 1970-72, he was a member of the U.S. delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) with the Soviet Union‚Äîa major step towards controlling nuclear weapons. Carnesale teaches undergraduate and graduate courses at UCLA on topics relating to U.S. national security. Early years Carnesale was born on July 2, 1936, in the Bronx, New York. His father was a taxi driver; his mother was an office clerk. He graduated from the Bronx High School of Science, where admission is based solely on a competitive written exam. The first person in his family to attend college, he began his university education at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, completing a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 1957. He received a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1961 and a PhD in nuclear engineering at North Carolina State University (NCSU) in 1966. While earning his master's degree, Carnesale also worked as a senior engineer at Martin Marietta Corporation. Career  North Carolina State University  Carnesale served on the nuclear engineering faculty at NCSU from 1962‚Äì69 and as professor and head of the Division of University Studies from 1972-74. Harvard University During a 23-year tenure at Harvard University, Carnesale steadily ascended the ranks. He began as a member of the faculty in 1974, and concentrated on the study of international relations, national security policy, and nuclear arms control. In 1981 he was promoted to academic dean of the Kennedy School of Government. A decade later, Carnesale became dean and was charged with restructuring the school, which faced a budget deficit, and served in that post from 1991-1995. According to a lecturer at the School, Carnesale was appointed \\"because by the force of his personality, his great sense of humor and his capacity for getting to the heart of things quickly, he defused tensions.\\" When the New York Times announced the appointment, Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine described Carnesale as \\"an exceptional human being.\\" At the time of Carnesale's appointment, the Kennedy School faced \\"a debate over its identity,\\" as tension developed between faculty who were professional scholars and those who were practitioners. Carnesale said the solution lay in finding the right balance and respecting each other's contribution. In 1994, Carnesale was tapped to fill the role of university provost, where he served until 1997. In that position he coordinated the university's central administration and oversaw academic programs that extended beyond Harvard's individual schools. He was key to the university's $2.1 billion capital campaign and efforts to apply information technology to academic and administrative operations. He also was part of the campaign to draw together Harvard's nine different faculties. In November 1994, Carnesale was appointed acting president of Harvard while President Rudenstine was on leave. He served in that position for three months. University of California, Los Angeles  On July 1, 1997, Carnesale was appointed chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles, a position he held until June 30, 2006. Some of Carnesale's Harvard colleagues saw his departure as \\"a terrible loss.\\" Some at both Harvard and UCLA were concerned about his ability to understand a large public university system. His response: \\"I have enormous interest in all things public. I spent nine years teaching at a public university. In between I was in government. I spent my academic years at Harvard in the areas of public policy and administration.\\" Carnesale arrived at UCLA when the UC system was facing soaring costs and sharp budget cuts. He said the university must remain affordable for all Californians. While chancellor, he wrote and spoke about the \\"public-private gap in higher education,\\" presenting funding models that could potentially enable public institutions to \\"remain true to the basic values on which they were founded: excellence and access for qualified students, regardless of ability to pay.\\" Throughout his tenure, Carnesale concentrated on attracting research funding and private gifts to sustain UCLA's trajectory toward the top tier of research universities in the face of declining state support. From 1997-2005, UCLA'a annual operating budget grew from $2.2 billion to $3.5 billion, while the state's portion shrank from 20.7 percent to 15 percent. When Carnesale was appointed at UCLA, California's Proposition 209 had just gone into effect, forbidding all state institutions from giving preference in admissions based on race or ethnicity. Carnesale believed diversity was essential in order for UCLA to fulfill its responsibilities as a public university. He cited three reasons: 1) Diversity is essential for providing the best possible education because students learn from each other. 2) Diversity is necessary in order to prepare leaders for all segments of society‚Äîa charge of public universities. 3) Education is key to social and economic mobility. He said affirmative action is just one means of achieving diversity. \\"We can encourage minority students whose records make them eligible to apply, and then encourage those admitted to enroll. . . .We have to get more minorities eligible [so] we have to get more engaged in the high schools. . . . Equal opportunity should be a goal, an aspiration.\\" In May 1998, 88 UCLA students were arrested for refusing to leave a building during a 12-hour non-violent protest, demanding that Carnesale defy Prop 209. He replied that while he supported diversity on campus, he could not ignore Prop 209. \\"I came to this university, knowing that Prop 209 would go into effect on my watch,\\" he said. \\"I made the decision that it was important to do the best we could within the law, rather than stay at Harvard and not try.\\" Following the events of September 11, 2001, Carnesale initiated a seminar program named for the university's motto, Fiat Lux, which means \\"Let there be light.\\" The program of 200 seminars was established to help students understand the events of September 11. The seminars enabled small, interdisciplinary groups of students to explore critical issues with faculty. Carnesale taught a seminar on national security. As chancellor, Carnesale oversaw the completion of a $3.1 billion fundraising campaign‚Äîat the time the most ambitious in the history of higher education. He also launched the California Nanosystems Institute (CNSI), the Broad Stem Cell Research Institute, the Nazarian Center for Israeli Studies, and the Institute for Society and Genetics. Under his leadership, research funding from competitively awarded grants and contracts doubled, and UCLA formed more than 100 partnerships through Carnesale's \\"UCLA in L.A.\\" initiative. During this time, the university took major steps toward transformation from a commuter school to a residential campus. From 1997-2005, UCLA completed or had under construction new housing for more than 4,600 undergraduate and graduate students. Other additions to the campus included the UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center, Broad Art Center and new buildings for health sciences, physics, engineering, and CNSI. In addition, Glorya Kaufman Hall, Haines Hall, and the Humanities Building were renovated. Construction began on the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. UCLA Athletics added 23 NCAA titles. When Carnesale announced that he was stepping down in 2006, he said he had missed teaching and policymaking and that his decision was prompted in part by current events. He said there were relatively few people working in national security who had Ph.D.s in fields like nuclear engineering. \\"If you're worried about nuclear proliferation and weapons of mass destruction and the like, and can bring that technical background as well as the policy background in international affairs and security . . . It's a comparative advantage that I have in an area that's terribly important to the country right now. When he stepped down, he took a year-long sabbatical and then resumed teaching in UCLA's Luskin School of Public Affairs and Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science. In 2013, a new building in the residential portion of the UCLA campus was named Robin and Albert Carnesale Commons in honor of the chancellor emeritus and his wife. The building houses one of the nation's first health-themed dining halls, as well as a fitness hall and multipurpose space.  Government and public policy  From 1969-72 Carnesale served as chief of the Defensive Weapons Systems Division, Science and Technology Bureau of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in Washington, D.C. From 1970-72, he was a member of the U.S. delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) with the Soviet Union -- a major step towards controlling nuclear weapons. Between 1977 and 1980, he led the U.S. delegation to the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE). This 66-nation multilateral meeting was intended to investigate and ultimately make recommendations regarding the relationships between civilian and military uses of nuclear energy and materials. In 1980 Carnesale was nominated by President Carter to be chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. However, Carter's term as president ended before the nomination was brought to a Senate vote. At the time of Carnesale's nomination, one of his Harvard colleagues said, \\"He's really perfect for the job. First, he's got a technical background--he's not a political appointee. At the same time, he can communicate complex technical issues in a way that is understandable to lay audiences.\\" In 1995, President Clinton appointed Carnesale to the Scientific and Policy Advisory Committee of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. In 2009, Carnesale chaired a National Academies committee overseeing efforts to outline \\"America's Climate Choices\\" at the request of Congress. When the committee submitted their report, in 2011, Carnesale said, [Climate change] is an urgent problem to turn to, and what we've done differently is look at this as a risk management problem. We don't know exactly when the tsunami will hit or how high it will be, but we know it is coming, and we should prepare.\\" In 2010 the U.S. Department of Energy appointed Carnesale to a high-level national commission on nuclear waste production, the 15-person Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. Carnesale said the issues before the commission related \\"not only to nuclear power and reduced dependence on fossil fuels but also to climate change and nuclear proliferation.\\" In 2014, he was appointed to the U.S. Secretary of Energy's Advisory Board. He also chaired the National Academies Committees on NASA's Strategic Direction, on Nuclear Forensics and on the U.S. Conventional Prompt Global Strike. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Pacific Council on International Policy.  Honors  Carnesale was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996 and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2008. In 2011 he received the Harvard Medal for service to the university. Also in 2011, he was elected to the Nation Academy of Engineering \\"for bringing engineering excellence and objectivity to international security and arms control, and for leadership in higher education.\\" In 1997, he received an honorary doctor of letters degree from NCSU. He also holds honorary degrees from Harvard University (A.M.), New Jersey Institute of Technology (Sc.D.), Drexel University (LL.D.) and Pardee RAND Graduate School (D.P.P). In 1985, he received the Gano Dunn Award for Outstanding Professional Achievement from the Cooper Union.

For a purely specular seismic event the value of specularity should be equal to unity, as the angle between the surface normal vector and the angle bisector should be zero, according to Snell's Law. For a diffractive seismic event, the specularity can be sub-unitary. During the seismic migration, one can filter each seismic event according to the value of specularity, in order to enhance the contribution of diffractions in the seismic image. Alternatively, the events can be separated in different sub- images according to the value of specularity to produce a specularity gather.

It was in use from 1840 to 1875 as a passenger station and then as a freight terminal until it was destroyed by fire in 1964. Substantial remains lay derelict until they were demolished in the early 2000s to make way for Shoreditch High Street railway station which now stands on the site. History The station was opened with the name Shoreditch (or LondonForgotten Stations of Greater London by J.E.Connor and B.Halford) by the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) on 1 July 1840 to serve as its new permanent terminus when the railway was extended westwards from an earlier temporary terminus at Devonshire Street, near Mile End. The station was renamed Bishopsgate on 27 July 1846 with the intention of drawing more City commuters by naming it after the major thoroughfare in the heart of the financial district. In 1862, the ECR amalgamated with a number of other East Anglian railway companies to form the Great Eastern Railway (GER). For a time the GER also used Fenchurch Street as a terminus but a lack of capacity led the GER to build a new terminus for its services at Liverpool Street which opened in 1874. Bishopsgate station was closed to passenger traffic in November 1875 and then extensively reconstructed between 1878 and 1880 to convert it into a goods station. \\"By May 1880 the old facade and side walls had been completely removed.\\" The new goods station opened in 1881 and became known as Bishopsgate goods yard. A passenger station called Bishopsgate (Low Level) was provided on the new route into Liverpool Street. Platforms of this station are still visible from trains on the approach into Liverpool Street. Map of the Bishopsgate and Liverpool Street area, 1906 As a goods depot, Bishopsgate handled very large volumes of goods from the eastern ports and was arranged over three levels with turntables and hoists allowing railway wagons to be moved individually around the station for loading and unloading. Incoming goods could be stored in the warehouse on site or transferred directly to road vehicles for onward transportation to their destinations. A major fire on 5 December 1964 destroyed the station. Within 40 minutes of the first firefighters arriving on scene, the scale of the blaze was so intense and widespread that the London Fire Brigade had mobilised 40 fire engines. In addition, 12 aerial turntable platforms, two firehose-laying vehicles and two emergency tenders as well as 235 firefighters battled the fire which killed two customs officials and destroyed hundreds of railway wagons, dozens of motor vehicles and millions of pounds worth of goods. The station was subsequently closed and the upper-level structures were largely demolished. Over the next 40 years much of the site became derelict. Following an extended period of planning, the entire site was demolished in 2003-04, with the exception of a number of Grade II listed structures: ornamental gates on Shoreditch High Street and the remaining of the so-called \\"Braithwaite Viaduct\\", one of the oldest railway structures in the world and the second- oldest in London, designed by John Braithwaite. The demolition of the former Bishopsgate station made way for Shoreditch High Street station on the East London line extension in 2010, part of the new London Overground network, replacing Shoreditch Underground station to the east which had closed in June 2006. A mixed-use development on the former goods yard site, named The Goodsyard, has also been proposed. Accidents and incidents *On 21 November 1856, nine people were injured in a low-speed collision at Bishopsgate. The author of a Board of Trade report into the incident stated: \\"I have no doubt that it was occasioned by the carelessness of the driver, and a loose way of conducting the shunting in the yard; and I am of the opinion that proper instructions on the subject of signalling for the shunting of trains should form part of those issued for the guidance of drivers and shunters.\\"http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=3001 *On 22 November 1871, a head-on collision due to a driver's error and inadequate signalling resulted in a derailment. Fourteen people were injured in the incident.http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/eventsummary.php?eventID=3345 *On 19 June 1872, the driver of a service from Enfield on its approach to Bishopsgate crossed the path of a Shenfield-bound train, resulting in a collision that injured eight people.http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=3328 *On 9 August 1872, six people were injured when a train hit the buffers at Bishopsgate.

Karaites maintain that all of the divine commandments handed down to Moses by God were recorded in the written Torah without additional Oral Law or explanation. It is distinct from mainstream Rabbinic Judaism, which considers the Oral Torah, as codified in the Talmud and subsequent works, to be authoritative interpretations of the Torah. As a result, Karaite Jews do not accept as binding the written collections of the oral tradition in the Midrash or Talmud. When interpreting the Torah, Karaites strive to adhere to the plain or most obvious meaning (peshat) of the text; this is not necessarily the literal meaning, but rather the meaning that would have been naturally understood by the ancient Israelites when the books of the Torah were first written. By contrast, Rabbinic Judaism relies on the legal rulings of the Sanhedrin as they are codified in the Midrash, Talmud, and other sources to indicate the authentic meaning of the Torah. Karaite Judaism holds every interpretation of the Torah to the same scrutiny regardless of its source, and teaches that it is the personal responsibility of every individual Jew to study the Torah, and ultimately decide personally its correct meaning. Karaites may consider arguments made in the Talmud and other works without exalting them above other viewpoints. According to Mordecai ben Nissan, the ancestors of the Karaites was a group called Benei ·π¢edeq during the Second Temple period.For instance, see Mordecai ben Nissan's Sefer Dod Mordekhai on the division of the House of Israel into two parts, [1699; first published in Vienna, 1830] republished in Ramle, Israel, 1966 by ·∏§evrat Ha·π£la·∏•ah LiVnei Miqra‚Äô (publishing house of the Karaite Jews of Israel). Historians have argued over whether Karaism has a direct connection to the Sadducees, dating back to the end of the Second Temple period (70 CE), or whether Karaism represents a novel emergence of similar views. Karaites have always maintained that, while there are some similarities to the Sadducees due to the rejection of rabbinical authority and the Oral Law, there are major differences. According to Rabbi Abraham ibn Daud, in his Sefer HaQabbalah, the Karaite movement crystallized in Baghdad in the Gaonic period (circa 7th‚Äì9th centuries) under the Abbasid Caliphate in what is present-day Iraq. This is the view universally accepted among Rabbinic Jews. However, some Arab scholars claim that Karaites were already living in Egypt in the first half of the 7th century, based on a legal document that the Karaite community in Egypt had in its possession until the end of the 19th century, in which the first Islamic governor ordered the leaders of the Rabbinite community against interfering with Karaite practices or the way they celebrate their holidays. It was said to have been stamped by the palm of 'Amr ibn al-'As, the first Islamic governor of Egypt, and was reportedly dated 20 AH (641 CE).Al-Tahdhib, No. 38, 5 Sept. 1902, p. 158.Ash-Shubban Al-Qarra‚Äôin 4, 2 June 1937, p. 8, and Mourad El-Kodsi, The Karaite Jews of Egypt, 1987. Karaites at one time made up a significant proportion of the Jewish population.A. J. Jacobs, The Year of Living Biblically, p. 69. Estimates of the Karaite population are difficult to make because they believe on the basis of Genesis 32 that counting Jews is forbidden. In the 21st century, some 30,000‚Äì50,000 are thought to reside in Israel, with smaller communities in Turkey, Europe and the United States.Isabel Kershner, \\"New Generation of Jewish Sect Takes Up Struggle to Protect Place in Modern Israel\\", The New York Times, 4 September 2013. Another estimate holds that, of the 50,000 worldwide, more than 40,000 descend from those who made aliyah from Egypt and Iraq to Israel. The largest Karaite community today resides in the Israeli city of Ashdod.Community of Ashdod History Origins The Karaite Synagogue in the Old City (Jerusalem) Arguments among Jewish sects regarding the validity of the Oral Law date back to Hellenistic period, the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. Accordingly, some scholars trace the origin of Karaism to those who rejected the Talmudic tradition as an innovation. Judah Halevi, an 11th-century Jewish philosopher and rabbi, wrote a defense for Judaism entitled Kuzari, placing the origins of Karaism in the first and second centuries BCE, during the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (\\"King Jannai\\"), king of Judaea from 103 to 76 BCE: Abraham Geiger, a 19th-century German scholar who founded Reform Judaism, posited a connection between the Karaites and a remnant of the Sadducees, the 1st-century Jewish sect that followed the Hebrew Bible literally and rejected the Pharisees' notion of an Oral Torah even before it was written. Geiger's view is based on comparison between Karaite and Sadducee halakha: for example, a minority in Karaite Judaism do not believe in a resurrection of the dead or afterlife, a position also held by the Sadducees. The British theologian John Gill (1767) noted, Gill also traces the Karaite sect to the split between the schools of Hillel the Elder and Shammai in 30 BCE.Gill, John. A Collection of Sermons and Tracts...: To which are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Life, Writing, and Character of the Author, Volume 3. London: George Keith, 1778. pg= 529 American scholar Bernard Revel rejects many of Geiger's proofs in his 1913 published dissertation, The Karaite Halakah. Revel also points to the many correlations between Karaite halakha and theology and the interpretations of Philo of Alexandria, the 1st-century philosopher and Jewish scholar. He also notes the writings of a 10th-century Karaite who refers to Philo's works, showing that the Karaites made use of Philo's writings in the development of their movement. Later Medieval Karaite commentators did not view Philo in a favorable light. These attitudes show a friction between later Karaite theology and possible connections to Philo's philosophy, which could serve as either a rejection of their origins, rejection of theological positions no longer accepted, or that Philo's philosophy was not entirely used in the founding of the Karaites (although some influences remain possible). Early 20th-century scholars Oesterley and Box suggested that Karaism formed in a reaction to the rise of Islam. Oesterley, W. O. E. & Box, G. H. (1920) A Short Survey of the Literature of Rabbinical and Medi√¶val Judaism, Burt Franklin: New York. The new religion recognized Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith, but claimed that it detracted from its belief by deferring to rabbinical authority. 9th century Anan ben David (, c. 715 ‚Äì 795 or 811?) is widely considered to be a major founder of the Karaite movement. His followers were called Ananites; they did not believe the rabbinical oral law was divinely inspired. According to a 12th-century Rabbanite account, in approximately 760, Shelomoh ben ·∏§isdai II, the Exilarch in Babylon died, and two brothers among his nearest kin, Anan ben David (whose name according to the Rabbanite account was Anan ben Shafa·π≠, but was called \\"ben David\\" due to his Davidic lineage) and ·∏§ananyah were next in order of succession. Eventually ·∏§ananyah was elected by the rabbis of the Babylonian Jewish colleges (the Geonim) and by the notables of the chief Jewish congregations, and the choice was confirmed by the Caliph of Baghdad. A schism may have occurred, with Anan ben David being proclaimed exilarch by his followers.. However, not all scholars agree that this event occurred. Leon Nemoy notes, \\"Natronai, scarcely ninety years after ‚ÄòAnan's secession, tells us nothing about his aristocratic (Davidic) descent or about the contest for the office of exilarch which allegedly served as the immediate cause of his apostasy.\\"See Karaite Anthology; Yale Judaica Series 7 Nemoy later notes that Natronai ‚Äî a devout Rabbanite ‚Äî lived where Anan's activities took place, and that the Karaite sage Jacob Qirqisani never mentioned Anan's purported lineage or candidacy for Exilarch. Anan's allowing his followers to proclaim him as Exilarch was considered treason by the Muslim government. He was sentenced to death, but his life was saved by his fellow prisoner, Abu Hanifa, the founder of the madhhab or school of fiqh (Muslim jurisprudence) known as the Hanafi. Ultimately he and his followers were permitted to migrate to Palestine. They erected a synagogue in Jerusalem that continued to be maintained until the time of the Crusades. From this center, the sect diffused thinly over Syria, spread into Egypt, and ultimately reached Southeast Europe. Ben David challenged the Rabbanite establishment. Some scholars believe that his followers may have absorbed Jewish Babylonian sects such as the Isunians (followers of Abu Isa), Yudghanites, and the remnants of the pre-Talmudic Sadducees and Boethusians. Later, sects such as the Ukbarites emerged separately from the Ananites. However, the Isunians, Yudghanites, ‚ÄòUkabarites, and Mishawites all held views that did not accord with those of either the Ananites or the Karaites. Abu ‚ÄòIsa al-Isfahani, who was an illiterate tailor, claimed to be a prophet, prohibited divorce, claimed that all months should have thirty days, believed in Jesus and Muhammad as prophets, and told his followers that they must study the New Testament and the Qur‚Äôan. Yudghan was a follower of ‚ÄòIsa al-Isfahani and claimed to be a prophet and the Messiah, saying that the observance of Shabbat and Holy Days was no longer obligatory. Isma‚Äòil al-‚ÄòUkbari believed he was the prophet Elijah, and hated Anan. Mishawayh al-‚ÄòUkbari, who was a disciple of Isma‚Äòil al-‚ÄòUkbari and the founder of the Mishawites, taught his followers to use a purely solar calendar of 364 days and 30-day months, insisting that all the Holy Days and fast days should always occur on fixed days in the week, rather than on fixed days of the months. He further said that Shabbat should be kept from sunrise on Saturday to sunrise on Sunday. Most Ananites and Karaites rejected such beliefs. Anan developed his movement's core tenets. His Sefer HaMi·π£wot (\\"The Book of the Commandments\\") was published about 770. He adopted many principles and opinions of other anti-rabbinic forms of Judaism that had previously existed. He took much from the old Sadducees and Essenes, whose remnants still survived, and whose writings‚Äîor at least writings ascribed to them‚Äîwere still in circulation. Thus, for example, these older sects prohibited the burning of any lights and the leaving of one's dwelling on the Sabbath. Unlike the Sadducees, Anan and the Qumran sectaries allowed persons to leave their house, but prohibited leaving one's town or camp. Anan said that one should not leave one's house for frivolous things, but only to go to prayer or to study scripture. The Sadducees required the observation of the new moon to establish the dates of festivals and always held the Shavuot festival on a Sunday. The Golden Age In the \\"Golden Age of Karaism\\" (900‚Äì1100) a large number of Karaite works were produced in all parts of the Muslim world, the most notable being a work penned by Jacob Qirqisani, entitled KitƒÅb al-AnwƒÅr wal-MarƒÅqib (\\"Code of Karaite Law\\"), which provides valuable information concerning the development of Karaism and throws light also on many questions in Rabbinic Judaism. Karaite Jews were able to obtain autonomy from Rabbanite Judaism in the Muslim world and establish their own institutions. Karaites in the Muslim world also obtained high social positions such as tax collectors, doctors, and clerks, and even received special positions in the Egyptian courts. Karaite scholars were among the most conspicuous practitioners in the philosophical school known as Jewish Kalam. According to historian Salo Wittmayer Baron, at one time the number of Jews affiliating with Karaism was as much as 40 percent of world Jewry, and debates between Rabbinist and Karaite leaders were not uncommon. Among the staunchest critics of Karaite thought and practice at this time was Rabbi Saadia Gaon, whose writings brought about a permanent split between some Karaite and Rabbanite communities. Anecdote about Karaites in Egypt during the 13th- century Egypt had long been a bastion for Karaites and their teachings.Ash- Shubban Al-Qarra‚Äôin 4, 2 June 1937, p. 8, and Mourad El-Kodsi, The Karaite Jews of Egypt (2nd edition) 2007, Introduction (). According to Rabbi David ibn Zimra, in one day in Egypt, a great congregation of Karaites returned to the principles of orthodox Jewry as taught by the Rabbanites during the time of the Nagid, Rabbi Abraham ben Maimonides, who, in his words, \\"was not reluctant to receive them.\\", s.v. Part VII, responsum # 9 (first printed in Livorno 1652; reprinted in Israel, n.d.) () Karaites in the Russian Empire Karaim kenesa in Trakai. During the 19th century, Russian authorities began to differentiate Karaite Jews from Rabbanite Jews, freeing them from various oppressive laws that affected Rabbinic Jews. In the 1830s the Tsarist governor of the Taurida Governorate, Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, told the Karaite leaders that, even though the Russian Empire liked the idea that the Karaites did not accept the Talmud, they were still Jews and responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus and thus subject to the laws. The leaders, hearing that, devised a ruse by which they could be freed of the oppressive laws and told him that the Karaites had already settled in the Crimea before the death of Jesus. The Tsarist government then said that, if they could prove it, they would be free of the oppressive laws.Karaites//Jewish Enciclpedia The community leaders charged Abraham Firkovich (1786-1874) with gathering anything that could help show that Karaites were not in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus, and thus not responsible for the crucifixion. Through his work, Firkovich helped establish the idea among the Russian authorities that the Karaites, as descendants of the exiled northern kingdom of Israel, had already gone into exile centuries before the death of Jesus and thus had no responsibility for it. Firkovich referenced tombstones in Crimea (altering the dates) and gathered thousands of Karaite, Rabbinic, and Samaritan manuscripts, including one rabbinic document from Transcaucasia that claims that the Jews there were descendants of the exiles from the northern Kingdom of Israel. ◊ê◊®◊• ◊†◊ú◊ï◊™◊ù ◊ï◊û◊î◊™◊î◊ú◊ö ◊ë◊í◊®◊ï◊™ ◊õ◊®◊ô◊ù ◊î◊û◊ì◊ô◊†◊î ◊ë◊û◊ï◊©◊ë◊ï◊™ ◊ñ◊®◊¢ ◊û◊©◊§◊ó◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊ï◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊î ◊í◊ú◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ù ◊©◊ô◊¶◊ê◊ï ◊ú◊¢◊ñ◊®◊™ ◊ê◊ó◊ô◊î◊ù ◊û◊¢◊®◊ô◊î◊ù ◊ë◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊™ ◊©◊û◊®◊ï◊ü ◊ï◊í◊ì◊ú◊ô◊î ◊ë◊ü ◊î◊û◊ú◊ö ◊ê◊ó◊ñ ◊ë◊®◊ê◊©◊ù ◊ú◊ú◊ê ◊î◊ï◊¢◊ô◊ú ◊õ◊ô ◊û◊ú◊ê◊î ◊°◊ê◊™◊ù. ◊ï◊™◊§◊©◊ù ◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊©◊ú◊û◊†◊ê◊°◊® ◊ß◊ï◊ì◊ù ◊ú◊õ◊ì◊ï ◊ê◊™ ◊©◊û◊®◊ï◊ü ◊ï◊ô◊©◊ú◊ó◊ù ◊ú◊§◊†◊ô◊ù ◊í◊ï◊ú◊î ◊ú◊¢◊®◊ô ◊û◊ì◊ô ◊ú◊î◊®◊ó◊ô◊ß◊ù ◊û◊¢◊ú ◊ê◊ó◊ô◊î◊ù ◊ï◊ô◊î◊ô◊ï ◊©◊ù ◊¢◊ì ◊ô◊û◊ô ◊õ◊û◊ë◊ô◊° ◊ë◊ü ◊õ◊ï◊®◊© ◊î◊û◊ú◊ö ◊¢◊î ◊ï◊î◊ï◊ê ◊î◊ò◊î ◊ú◊î◊ù ◊ó◊°◊ì ◊ë◊î◊ó◊ú◊¶◊ù ◊ú◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊î ◊ó◊ï◊©◊ô◊ù ◊¢◊ù ◊ë◊†◊ô ◊û◊ì◊ô ◊î◊ô◊ï◊™◊ù ◊ß◊®◊ï◊ë◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊ê◊®◊• ◊î◊©◊ô◊ò◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊î◊ú◊ó◊ù ◊¢◊ù ◊™◊ú◊û◊ô◊®◊ê ◊î◊û◊ú◊õ◊î ◊ú◊†◊ß◊ï◊ù ◊ì◊ù ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ï ◊û◊û◊†◊î ◊ï◊ë◊î◊™◊í◊ë◊®◊ù ◊¢◊ú ◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ú◊ï◊™◊ô◊î ◊™◊§◊ï◊©◊î ◊ë◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊ô◊ë◊ô◊ê◊ï◊î ◊ú◊§◊†◊ô ◊õ◊û◊ë◊ô◊° ◊û◊ú◊õ◊ù ◊ï◊ô◊î◊®◊í◊î ◊ë◊ì◊ù ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ï ◊ï◊ô◊õ◊ë◊ï◊© ◊ê◊™ ◊ê◊®◊¶◊î ◊ï◊ô◊ë◊ß◊©◊ï ◊û◊û◊†◊ï ◊ï◊ô◊™◊†◊î ◊ú◊ê◊ó◊ï◊ñ◊î ◊ú◊î◊ù ◊ï◊ô◊©◊ù ◊ë◊î ◊†◊¶◊ô◊ë◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊ô◊©◊ï◊ë◊ï ◊ë◊©◊ú◊ï◊ù ◊ï◊ô◊ß◊ó◊ï ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊ï◊û◊ì◊ô ◊î◊©◊ë◊ô◊ù ◊û◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊î ◊†◊©◊ô◊î◊ù ◊ï◊ò◊§◊ù ◊ï◊®◊õ◊ï◊©◊ù ◊ï◊ô◊™◊ô◊©◊ë◊ï ◊©◊ù ◊ë◊õ◊ï◊®◊©◊ï◊ü ◊©◊î◊¶◊ô◊ë ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ï ◊õ◊ï◊®◊© ◊ú◊ï ◊©◊ù ◊ô◊ì ◊ï◊©◊ù ◊ë◊°◊ï◊ú◊õ◊™ ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ ◊©◊ë◊†◊ï ◊ï◊ë◊ê◊ï◊†◊õ◊™ ◊ô◊ï◊†◊ô◊™ ◊©◊™◊ß◊†◊ï ◊ó◊®◊ë◊ï◊™◊ô◊î ◊ï◊ô◊ß◊®◊ê◊ï◊ù ◊õ◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊ë◊°◊ú◊¢ ◊î◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊ê◊©◊® ◊ë◊¶◊®◊ï ◊ï◊ë◊¢◊ô◊® ◊°◊§◊®◊ì ◊¢◊ú ◊ô◊ù ◊î◊©◊ô◊ò◊ô◊ù ◊©◊©◊ô◊ò◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊û◊©◊ô◊ò◊ô◊ù ◊û◊ß◊†◊ô◊î◊ù ◊ú◊¢◊ô◊® ◊û◊ò◊®◊õ◊î ◊î◊ô◊ï◊†◊ô◊™ ◊¢◊ô◊® ◊û◊í◊ï◊®◊ô ◊ê◊ë◊ô ◊ë◊ô◊ü ◊í◊ú◊ï◊™ ◊ò◊ô◊ò◊ï◊° ◊î◊ù ◊î◊ù ◊ê◊ó◊ô◊†◊ï ◊î◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊°◊í◊ï◊ú◊™ ◊í◊ú◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ù ◊©◊î◊í◊ú◊ù ◊ò◊ô◊ò◊ï◊° ◊®◊ê◊©◊ï◊†◊î ◊ú◊¢◊®◊ô ◊ô◊ï◊ü ◊ú◊§◊ô◊°◊†◊ò◊ô◊ê ◊ï◊ë◊†◊ï◊™◊ô◊î ◊ï◊û◊©◊ù ◊†◊™◊§◊©◊ò◊ï ◊ú◊¢◊ô◊® ◊ò◊ô◊®◊ê◊§◊ô◊ñ ◊ï◊ê◊ó◊ô◊ï◊™◊ô◊î ◊¢◊ì ◊¢◊ô◊® ◊û◊ò◊®◊õ◊î ◊ë◊ô◊û◊ô ◊ô◊ï◊ú◊ê◊†◊ï◊ù ◊ß◊ô◊°◊® ◊§◊ô◊°◊†◊ò◊ô◊ê ◊ê◊ï◊î◊ë ◊î◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊ú◊õ◊ü ◊î◊ù ◊û◊ì◊ë◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊ú◊©◊ï◊ü ◊ô◊ï◊ü ◊¢◊ì ◊î◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊ï◊ë◊ë◊ï◊ê◊ô ◊ú◊¢◊ô◊® ◊û◊ï◊ú◊ì◊™◊ô ◊§◊î ◊©◊ï◊û◊õ◊ô ◊¢◊ô◊® ◊û◊ú◊õ◊ï◊™ ◊ì◊®◊ô◊ï◊© ◊î◊û◊ì◊ô ◊©◊ô◊®◊ï◊ï◊ü ◊ë◊©◊†◊™ ◊ó◊û◊ô◊©◊ô◊™ ◊ú◊û◊ú◊õ◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ê◊ì◊ï◊ü ◊õ◊ï◊°◊ì◊ï◊®◊ô ◊î◊§◊®◊°◊ô ◊ê◊ú◊£ ◊ï◊©◊ú◊© ◊û◊ê◊ï◊™ ◊ú◊í◊ú◊ï◊™◊ô◊†◊ï ◊î◊í◊î◊™◊ô ◊ñ◊î ◊°◊§◊® ◊î◊™◊ï◊®◊î ◊ú◊û◊® ◊û◊®◊ì◊õ◊ô ◊î◊ó◊ë◊® ◊ë◊ü ◊©◊û◊¢◊ï◊ü ◊©◊ß◊ë◊ú ◊ó◊ë◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊¶◊ï ◊®◊¶◊ï◊†◊ï ◊ó◊ë◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊¢◊ú◊ô ◊û◊©◊†◊î ◊ï◊™◊ú◊û◊ï◊ì ◊î◊ë◊ë◊ú◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊ô◊ñ◊ó◊î ◊ú◊î◊í◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ï ◊î◊ï◊ê ◊ï◊ñ◊®◊¢◊ï ◊¢◊ì ◊¢◊ï◊ú◊ù ◊°◊ô◊û◊ü ◊ò◊ï◊ë ◊ê◊û◊ü Abraham Firkovich.¬´Manjalis Document¬ª (¬´◊†◊ï◊°◊ó ◊î◊®◊©◊ô◊û◊î ◊î◊†◊û◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊ë◊û◊†◊í'◊ô◊ú◊ô◊° / ◊¢◊ú ◊ô◊ì◊ô ◊õ◊û◊ï◊®◊î\\"◊® ... ◊ê◊ë◊®◊î◊ù ◊§◊ô◊®◊ß◊ï◊ï◊ô◊• ◊ë◊©◊†◊™ ◊î◊™◊®\\"◊ê ¬ª) Russian Prime Minister order about the differences in the rights of the Karaites and the Jews. These actions convinced the Tsar that Karaite ancestors could not have killed Jesus and that thus their descendants were free of familial guilt. Despite this, within the community ·∏§akhamim still taught that the Karaites were and had always been a part of the Jewish people; prayer was in Hebrew, the lineage of Kohens, Levites, and families of Davidic descent were meticulously preserved, and books printed in Hebrew adamantly identified the Karaites as Jews. In 1897 the Russian census counted 12,894 Karaites in the Russian Empire. Results of the Russian Empire Census of 1897, Table XII (Religions) By the early 20th century, most European Karaites were no longer very knowledgeable about the religion and Seraya Shapshal, a Karaite soldier of fortune who had been the tutor of the last Qajar Shah of Persia, Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar and a Russian spy, managed about 1911 to get himself elected Chief ·∏§akham of the Karaites in the Russian Empire (by that time, due to Russian regulations, the position had become more of a political one than a spiritual one). Influenced by the Pan-Turkic movement in Turkey,See Dan Shapira's work on the subject. Shapshal made his position into that of an Emperor-priest. He changed the title Hakham to \\"·∏§akhan\\" (a cross between the Turkic titles khagan and khan), forbade the use of Hebrew, and in the 1930s introduced pagan elements (such as the veneration of sacred oak trees in the cemetery). He recognized both Jesus and Muhammad as prophets (thus appeasing both the Russian Orthodox Tsarist government and the Muslim Turkic peoples). <\\\\-- is this a reliable source? --> After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, atheism became official state policy in Soviet territories and Karaite religious schools and places of worship were the very first religious institutions closed by the Soviet government. The authorities allowed only the teaching of Shapshalian doctrines about the Karaites, and the official stance according to Soviet law (carried over from Russian Imperial law) erroneously regarded the Karaites as Turkic descendants of the Khazars and not as Jews. Karaites in the Holocaust?, A Case of Mistaken Identity, by Nehemia Gordon Not all European Karaites accepted the Shapshalian doctrines. Some Hachamim and a small part of the general Karaite population still preserved their Jewish heritage, but most dared not oppose Shapshal openly due to his official standing with regard to the Soviet Union.http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/History/Tiro.pdf Six-Day War All Jewish men in Egypt were placed in camps during the Six-Day War, and they were kept there for up to two years; Karaites were among the last to leave; most of Egypt's Karaite Jews settled in Israel. Beliefs Karaite interpretations of the Torah Karaite Jews do not object to the idea of a body of interpretation of the Torah, along with extensions and development of non- rabbinic halakha (Jewish law) that strives to adhere to the Tanakh's straightforward meaning. Several hundred such books have been written by various Karaite ·∏§akhamim (sages) throughout the movement's history, although most are lost today. The disagreement arises over the rabbinic tradition's raising of the Talmud and the other writings of the rabbis above the Torah. The Karaites believe this has led to traditions and customs being kept under rabbinic law that contradict what is written in the Torah. The Karaites also have their own traditions and customs passed down from their ancestors and religious authorities. These are known as Sevel HaYerushah, which means \\"the Yoke [or burden] of Inheritance.\\" Most of these practices are kept primarily by traditional Karaites; theoretically, any tradition thereof is said to be rejected if it contradicts the simple meaning of the Tanakh's text. The vast majority of these traditions are not forced upon any Karaite Jew or convert to Judaism through the Karaite movement, except very few such as donning a head covering in the Karaite synagogues. Those Karaites who are new to the Karaite lifestyle do not have such an inheritance or tradition and tend to rely heavily upon just the Tanakh and those practices mentioned in it, and to adapt Biblical practices to their cultural context. Karaite communities are so small and generally isolated, that their members commonly adopt the customs of their host country. In Israel, too, traditional Karaites tend to be culturally assimilated into mainstream society (both secular and Orthodox). Many modern Karaite Jews have emerged from the Karaite revival of the late 20th century; the World Karaite Movement was founded by Nehemia Gordon and ·∏§akham Meir Rekhavi in the early 1990s. Karaite Jewish University (KJU), approved by the Mo‚Äòe·π£et Ha·∏§akhamim (the Council of Sages) in Israel, was founded to teach an introductory course on Karaite Judaism. It could lead to a student's conversion by a Beit Din (religious Jewish court) authorized by the Mo‚Äòe·π£et Ha·∏§akhamim. KJU teaches various forms of Karaite Judaism and includes Sevel HaYerushah in its course materials. Thus, newly admitted converts to Karaite Judaism can choose to accept or reject Sevel HaYerushah. Shabbat As with other Jews, during Shabbat, Karaites attend synagogues to worship and to offer prayers. Most Karaites refrain from sexual relations on that day since they maintain that engaging in them can cause fatigue and copulation, in particular, results in ritual impurity on this holy day, concerns that Rabbinic Judaism ceased to have long ago; additionally, impregnating one's wife is considered melakha (forbidden work). Their prayer books are composed almost completely of biblical passages. Karaite Jews often practice full prostration during prayers, while most other Jews no longer pray in this fashion. Unlike Rabbinic Jews, Karaites do not practice the ritual of lighting Shabbat candles. They have a differing interpretation of the Torah verse, \\"You shall not [burn] (Hebrew: bi‚Äòer the pi‚Äòel form of ba‚Äòar) a fire in any of your dwellings on the day of Shabbat.\\" In Rabbinic Judaism, the qal verb form ba‚Äòar is understood to mean \\"burn\\", whereas the pi‚Äòel form (present here) is understood to be, not intensive as usual but causative, the rule being that the pi‚Äòel of a stative verb will be causative, instead of the usual hif‚Äòil. Hence bi‚Äòer means \\"kindle\\", which is why Rabbinic Judaism prohibits starting a fire on Shabbat. The vast majority of Karaite Jews hold that, throughout the Tanakh, ba‚Äòar explicitly means \\"to burn\\", while the Hebrew word meaning \\"to ignite\\" or \\"to kindle\\" is hidliq. Accordingly, the mainstream in Karaite Judaism takes the passage to mean that fire should not be left burning in a Jewish home on Shabbat, regardless of whether it was lit prior to, or during the Sabbath. However, the minority of Karaites who view the prohibition to be on kindling a fire often permit a fire to continue burning into the Sabbath. Historically, Karaites refrained from using or deriving benefit from fire until the Sabbath ends, and accordingly their homes were not lit during the night of the Sabbath. Many modern Karaites today use a fluorescent or LED lamp powered by batteries, which is turned on prior to Shabbat. Many observant Karaites either unplug their refrigerators on Shabbat or turn off the circuit breakers. Karaites consider producing electricity to be a violation of Shabbat, no matter who produces it. Additionally, some Karaites view the purchasing of electricity that is charged on an incremental basis during the Shabbat as a commercial transaction that the Tanakh prohibits, no matter when the payment is made; the recording of the electric meter is considered by them to be a commercial transaction. Laws of ritual purity Karaites maintain that in the absence of a Temple, ordinary washing with flowing waters (described in the Torah as \\"living\\"‚Äîflowing‚Äîwater) should be substituted for purification with water that includes ashes obtained through the red heifer burning ritual. Karaites believe that this was the practice before the Tabernacle was built in the Sinai Peninsula following the Exodus.Vayyiqra (Leviticus) 22:6. They follow certain Torah laws for avoiding ·π¨um‚Äôat Met (ritual impurity caused by contact with a dead body, human bones, graves, or being present in a space under any ceiling where a human died) which are no longer considered relevant in Rabbinic Judaism, except for Kohanim (members of the Jewish priestly class). Sephirath Ha‚ÄòOmer and Shavu‚Äòoth The Karaite method of counting the days from the offering of the ‚ÄòOmer is different from the rabbinic method.Counting the Omer ‚Äì ◊°÷∞◊§÷¥◊ô◊®÷∑◊™ ◊î÷∏◊¢÷π◊û÷∂◊® The Karaites understand the term \\"morrow after the Sabbath\\" in Leviticus 23:15‚Äì16 to refer to the weekly Sabbath, whereas Rabbinic Judaism interprets it as referring to the day of rest on the first day of ·∏§agh HaMa·π£·π£ot. So while Rabbinic Judaism begins the count on the 16th of Nisan and celebrates Shavu‚Äòot on the 6th of Sivan, Karaite Jews count from the day after the weekly Sabbath (i.e., the Sunday) that occurs during the seven days of ·∏§agh HaMa·π£·π£ot to the day after the seventh weekly Sabbath. They celebrate Shavu‚Äòot on that Sunday, no matter what the calendar date of that Sunday on which it happens to fall. Tzitzit (·π¢i·π£iyot) A karaite ·π¢i·π£it with blue threads A Tzitzit (alternatively spelled ·π¢i·π£it, plural: Tzitziyot or ·π¢i·π£iyot) is a knotted or braided tassel worn by observant Jews (both Karaite and Rabbinic) on each of the four corners of what is often an outer garment or their Tallit. The Torah commands Israel to make tassels on the corners of their four-cornered garment containing a thread of Tekhelet () and repeats this commandment using the word for \\"twisted cords\\" (\\"Gedilim\\") instead of \\"tassels\\" at . The purpose of the tassels is stated in the Book of Numbers as a visual reminder to the Israelites to remember the commandments given by God. The thread of Tekhelet is a blue- violet or blue thread, which, according to the traditions of Rabbinic Judaism, is to be dyed with a specific kind of dye derived from a mollusc (notably the Hexaplex trunculus sea snail). Due to a number of factors, including Rome outlawing the use of Tekhelet by commoners, the source and practice of using a Tekhelet thread in Tzitzit was lost for most Rabbinic Jews. Their Tzitziyot are usually all white. Karaite Jews believe that the importance of Tekhelet is that the color of thread is blue-violet and it may be produced from any source, including synthetic industrial dyes, except impure (a state mostly overlapping unkosher) marine creatures, rather than insist on a specific dye. Therefore, they believe that the rabbinic tradition of relying on a dye from a mollusc is incorrect. They suggest that the source of the dye was indigo or Isatis tinctoria.Hakham Meir Yosef Rekhavi, \\"They Shall Make for Themselves Sisith (Fringe/Tassel)\\", Kharaite JudasimDr. Curtis D. Ward, \\"What is the True Tekhelet?\\", 5 January 2011, Ward blog Rabbinic Jews have specific traditions on how the tassels are to be knotted. Karaite Jews, for their part, have certain traditions on the manner of braiding the tassels, although they are not binding. Consequently, the way the Tzitziyot are made usually distinguishes Karaite Tzitziyot from rabbinic Tzitziyot. Tefillin Karaite Jews do not wear tefillin in any form. According to Karaites, the Biblical passages cited for this practice are metaphorical, and mean to \\"remember the Torah always and treasure it\\". This is because the commandment in scripture is \\"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart\\"... \\"And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for forehead ornaments between thine eyes\\". (Deuteronomy 6:5,9) Since words cannot be on one's heart, or bound on one's hand, the entire passage is understood metaphorically. Furthermore, the same expressions (\\"And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand\\" as well as \\"and they shall be as frontal ornaments between thine eyes\\") are used in Exodus 13:9 in reference to the commandments of ·∏§agh HaMa·π£·π£ot, in Exodus 13:16 in reference to the ritual of redeeming the first born, in Deuteronomy 6:8 in reference to the ‚ÄòAseret HaDevarim (the Ten Utterances, usually mistranslated as \\"the Ten Commandments\\"), and in Deuteronomy 11:18 in reference to all the words of the Torah, indicating that, from a Karaite perspective, they must be metaphorical in nature (because one could never ritually \\"write\\" and \\"bind\\" upon their hearts themselves). Mezuzot Like Tefillin, Karaites interpret the scripture that mandates inscribing the Law on doorposts and city gates as a metaphorical admonition, specifically, to keep the Law at home and away. This is because the previous commandment in the same passage is the source for Tefillin for Rabbinic Judaism, and is understood metaphorically due to the language. As a result, the entire passage is understood as a metaphor. Therefore, they do not put up mezuzot, although many Karaite Jews do have a small plaque with the Ten Commandments on their doorposts. However, a Christian account in the 19th century tells of a Karaite synagogue in Constantinople that reportedly had a mezuzah. In Israel, in an effort to make Rabbinic Jews comfortable, many Karaite Jews do put up mezuzot, but not out of belief that it is commanded. Mamzerim In both Deuteronomy 23:3, and Zechariah 9:6, the Hebrew word mamzer is referenced alongside the nations of Ammon and Moab (in Deut 23:3), and the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod (in Zech 9:5‚Äì6). From such, Karaites have come to consider the most logical understanding of the Hebrew word mamzer, which modern Rabbinical Jews understand to refer to either children born from adultery or from incest (Talmud Bavli, Masekhet Yevamot), to actually speak of a nation or people. Karaites think that such an understanding fits perfectly into the context of both Deuteronomy 23 and Zechariah 9, (and this was also the understanding of the Rabbinist commentator Yehudah ben Shemu‚Äôel ibn Bil‚Äòam). Several Medieval Rabbinite Jewish sages felt it necessary to debate this topic with Medieval Karaite Jewish sages. Four species Karaite Judaism defines the Four species (Arba\`at haMinim) somewhat differently than Rabbinic Jews, i.e. (1) fruit of splendorous tree (Peri \`E·π£ Hadar), which need not be the Etrog (yellow citrus fruit) demanded by rabbinic law, yet may be either any seasonal fruit tree considered splendorous by an individual Jew, or branches of olive trees featuring the olives, that were considered splendorous by the Judean Israelites in the generation of Nehemiah, as seen in Ne·∏•emyah 8; (2) date palm fronds (Kappoth Temarim) instead of the closed palm frond used by Rabbinic Jews; (3) branches of thickly leaved trees (‚ÄòE·π£ ‚ÄòAvoth) which may be from fig, laurel and eucalyptus rather than myrtle branches only; and (4) willow branches (‚ÄòAravoth Na·∏•al) e.g. maple, oak, yew and butternut, as opposed to the rabbinically dictated willow tree's boughs. Karaite Jews have always understood the Arba\`at haMinim to be used for the purpose of constructing the roof of the Sukkah (pl. Sukkot); they are not made into a lulav and shaken in six directions, as is the rabbinic practice. In the Book of Nehemiah (8:15), the Israelites are instructed to construct their Sukkot out of the four species: olive branches and oil tree branches (fruit of splendorous tree), as well as date palm fronds, myrtle branches and branches of thickly leaved trees are mentioned in the same passage as materials for the Sukkah's construction. Who is a Jew? Karaite Judaism follows patrilineal descent, meaning a Jew is either someone whose father is Jewish (since almost all Jewish descent in the Tanakh is traced patrilineally) or both of whose parents are Jews, or one who has undergone a formal conversion which entails circumcision for uncircumcised males and formally accepting the God of Israel as one's own God and the people of Israel as one's own people. Karaites believe that conversion to the Jewish people should be done after living among Jews (preferably Karaite) in the form of a vow (the dominant position among modern Karaites maintains that this oath should be taken before a Karaite Beit Din whose members act on the behalf of the Israeli Council of Sages); see Exodus 12:43‚Äì49, Ruth 1:16, Esther 8:17, and Isaiah 56:6‚Äì7 and studying the Tanakh. Also Ezekiel the prophet states that Sojourners (\\"resident aliens\\") who have joined themselves to the Children of Israel will be given land inheritance among the tribes of Israel among whom they live during the final Redemption. ◊ï÷∞◊ó÷¥◊ú÷∑÷º◊ß÷∞◊™÷∂÷º◊ù ◊ê÷∂◊™-◊î÷∏◊ê÷∏◊®÷∂◊• ◊î÷∑◊ñ÷π÷º◊ê◊™ ◊ú÷∏◊õ÷∂◊ù‚Äî◊ú÷∞◊©÷¥◊Å◊ë÷∞◊ò÷µ◊ô ◊ô÷¥◊©÷∞◊Ç◊®÷∏◊ê÷µ◊ú. ◊ï÷∞◊î÷∏◊ô÷∏◊î ◊™÷∑÷º◊§÷¥÷º◊ú◊ï÷º ◊ê◊ï÷π◊™÷∏◊î÷º ◊ë÷∞÷º◊†÷∑◊ó÷≤◊ú÷∏◊î ◊ú÷∏◊õ÷∂◊ù ◊ï÷º◊ú÷∞◊î÷∑◊í÷µ÷º◊®÷¥◊ô◊ù ◊î÷∑◊í÷∏÷º◊®÷¥◊ô◊ù ◊ë÷∞÷º◊™◊ï÷π◊õ÷∞◊õ÷∂◊ù ◊ê÷≤◊©÷∂◊Å◊®-◊î◊ï÷π◊ú÷¥◊ì◊ï÷º ◊ë÷∏◊†÷¥◊ô◊ù ◊ë÷∞÷º◊™◊ï÷π◊õ÷∞◊õ÷∂◊ù ◊ï÷∞◊î÷∏◊ô◊ï÷º ◊ú÷∏◊õ÷∂◊ù ◊õ÷∞÷º◊ê÷∂◊ñ÷∞◊®÷∏◊ó ◊ë÷¥÷º◊ë÷∞◊†÷µ◊ô ◊ô÷¥◊©÷∞◊Ç◊®÷∏◊ê÷µ◊ú ◊ê÷¥◊™÷∞÷º◊õ÷∂◊ù ◊ô÷¥◊§÷∞÷º◊ú◊ï÷º ◊ë÷∞◊†÷∑◊ó÷≤◊ú÷∏◊î ◊ë÷∞÷º◊™◊ï÷π◊ö÷∞ ◊©÷¥◊Å◊ë÷∞◊ò÷µ◊ô ◊ô÷¥◊©÷∞◊Ç◊®÷∏◊ê÷µ◊ú. ◊ï÷∞◊î÷∏◊ô÷∏◊î ◊ë÷∑◊©÷µ÷º◊Å◊ë÷∂◊ò ◊ê÷≤◊©÷∂◊Å◊®-◊í÷∏÷º◊® ◊î÷∑◊í÷µ÷º◊® ◊ê÷¥◊™÷º◊ï÷π ◊©÷∏◊Å◊ù ◊™÷¥÷º◊™÷∞÷º◊†◊ï÷º ◊†÷∑◊ó÷≤◊ú÷∏◊™◊ï÷π ◊†÷∞◊ê÷ª◊ù ◊ê÷≤◊ì÷π◊†÷∏◊ô ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î So shall you divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.

Pronouncing the Tetragrammaton Some, such as the Karaites Jews in Khorasan (Persia) viewed it in Medieval times as a Mitzvah to do so because the name appears some 6800 times throughout the Tanakh (the Jewish Bible). Today, publicly uttering the Tetragrammaton (4 letter name) of God in Hebrew is a controversial issue among Karaites and indeed all Jews. Virtually all traditional Karaites view the pronunciation of God's name to be blasphemous, and adhere to the rabbinic tradition of substituting \\"Adonai\\", when coming across YHWH while reading.. Other Karaites and some of those coming from a rabbinic background like Nehemia Gordon and ·∏§akham Meir Rekhavi, as well as some joiners to the people of Israel through Karaite Judaism such as James Walker and Daniel ben Immanuel, do not consider the pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton to be forbidden. There is, however, disagreement among scholars as to the correct pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton. Writings Karaism has produced a vast library of commentaries and polemics, especially during its \\"Golden Age\\". These writings prompted new and complete defenses of the Mishnah and the Talmud, the culmination of these in the writings of Saadia Gaon and his criticisms of Karaism. Though he opposed Karaism, the rabbinic commentator Abraham ibn Ezra regularly quoted Karaite commentators, particularly Yefet ben Ali, to the degree that a legend exists among some Karaites that Ibn Ezra was ben Ali's student. The most well-known Karaite polemic is Yi·π£·∏•aq ben Avraham of Troki's \\"Faith Strengthened\\" (), a comprehensive counter-Christian missionary polemic, which was later translated into Latin by Johann Christoph Wagenseil as part of a larger collection of Jewish anti-Christian polemics entitled Tela Ignea Satan√¶, sive Arcani et Horribiles Jud√¶orum Adversus Christum, Deum, et Christianam Religionem Libri (Altdorf, 1681: \\"The Fiery Darts of Satan, or the Arcane and Horrible Books of the Jews Against Christ, God, and the Christian Religion\\"). Many counter-missionary materials produced today are based upon or cover the same themes as this book. Scholarly studies of Karaite writings are still in their infancy, and owe greatly to the Firkovich collections of Karaite manuscripts in the National Library of Russia that have become accessible after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The cataloguing efforts of scholars at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France and in the United States and England is continuing to yield new insights into Karaite literature and thought. Karaites, Aharon Ben Mosheh Ben Asher, and the Masoretic Text Aaron ben Moses ben Asher was a Jewish scholar from Tiberias, famous as the most authoritative of the Tiberian Masoretes, and a member of a family who had been involved in creating and maintaining the Masoretic Text (authoritative text of the Hebrew scripture), for at least five generations. His Tiberian vocalization of the Bible is still, for all intents and purposes, the text all Jews continue to use, and he was the first systematic Hebrew grammarian. His Sefer Diqduqei HaTe‚Äòamim (\\"Grammar of the Punctuation/Vocalizations\\") was an original collection of grammatical rules and Masoretic information. Grammatical principles were not at that time considered worthy of independent study. The value of this work is that the grammatical rules presented by ben Asher reveal the linguistic background of vocalization for the first time. He had a tremendous influence on the world of Biblical criticism. In the nineteenth century, certain scholars suggested that Aharon Ben Asher might have been a Karaite and not a Rabbinic Jew. Aharon Dothan has examined this issue from many angles, and his conclusion is that Ben Asher was a Rabbinic Jew, but Raphael Zer has raised this issue again and presented new evidence.http://www.aleppocodex.org/links/8.html In 989, an unknown scribe of a former Nevi'im manuscript vouched for the care with which his copy was written by claiming that he had vocalized and added the Masoretic text \\"from the books that were vocalized by Aaron ben Moses Ben-Asher\\". Maimonides, by accepting the views of ben Asher in regard to open and closed sections, helped establish and spread his authority. \\"The book on which we have relied for these matters is the book that is well-known in Egypt, which includes twenty-four books, which was in Jerusalem for many years for the purpose of proofreading books from it. Everybody relied on it since Ben-Asher proofread it and scrutinized it for years, and proofread many times as he copied it. I relied on it when I wrote a Sefer Torah properly\\".Maimonides, Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah, and Sefer Torah, 8:5 Karaites today Karaite Synagogue in Ashdod Estimates of the size of the modern Karaite movement put the number at 1,500 Karaites in the United States,Wilensky, David (2018) \\"The expanding future of America‚Äôs only Karaite synagogue\\" jweekly.com some 80 Constantinopolitan Karaites in Turkey, 30,000 in Israel,Correspondent, J.

In 2007, however, Rabbi David ·∏§ayim Chelouche, the chief rabbi of Netayana was quoted in The Jerusalem Post as saying, \\"A Karaite is a Jew. We accept them as Jews and every one of them who wishes to come back [to mainstream Judaism] we accept back. There was once a question about whether Karaites needed to undergo a token circumcision in order to switch to Rabbinic Judaism, but the rabbinate agrees that today that is not necessary.\\"Freeman, Joshua. \\"Laying down the (Oral) law\\". The Jerusalem Post, May 22, 2007, p. 14. Moshe Marzouk, one of the Egyptian Jews executed in 1954 for planting bombs in Cairo in the service of Israeli Military Intelligence (the Lavon Affair) was a Karaite. Marzouk was considered a hero in Israel; however, his Karaite identity was downplayed in newspapers, which usually just described him as an Egyptian Jew. However, in 2001, the Israeli government, through the Israel Postal Authority, issued a special memorial sheet honoring him and many other Karaite Jews that gave their lives for Israel. In Israel, the Karaite Jewish leadership is directed by a group called Universal Karaite Judaism. Most of the members of its Board of ·∏§akhamim are of Egyptian Jewish descent. The largest Karaite community today resides in Ashdod Karaite Synagogue Congregation B‚Äônai Israel (Daly City, California) There are about 4,000 Karaites living in the United States. The Congregation B'nai Israel is located in Daly City, California, which is a suburb of San Francisco. It is the only Karaite synagogue in the United States with a permanent dedicated facility. The leaders of the congregation are of Egyptian Karaite extraction. One notable congregant, Mark Kheder, the synagogue's treasurer, has described his internment in an Egyptian prisoner-of-war camp during the 1967 Six-Day war. The congregation's acting Rav (·∏§akham), Joe Pessah, was also among those who were arrested by the Egyptian government. Another, much smaller congregation, Karaite Jewish Congregation Ora·∏• ·π¢addiqim, exists in Albany, NY, but they have yet to find a permanent dedicated facility and, in the meantime, continue to use a room in the home of their ·∏§akham, Avraham Ben-Ra·∏•ami√´l Qana√Ø, as their temporary synagogue. On 1 August 2007, some members of the first graduating class of Karaite Jewish University were converts, representing the first new officially authorized members into Karaite Judaism in 542 years. At a ceremony in its Northern California synagogue, ten adults and four minors joined the Jewish people by taking the same oath that Ruth took. The group's course of study lasted over one year. This conversion comes 15 years after the Karaite Council of Sages reversed its centuries-old ban on accepting converts.Karaites hold first conversion in 500 years . 2 August 2007, JTA Breaking News. On 17 February 2009, the second graduating class of converts took the oath. This included 11 adults and 8 minors. There are about 80 Karaites living in Istanbul, Turkey, where the only Karaite synagogue in Turkey, the Kahal haKadosh Bene Mikra, is still functional (on Shabbat and holy days) in the Hask√∂y neighborhood in the European part of the city. In Poland, Karaites are a recognized minority, represented by the Association of Polish Karaites () and the Karaite Religious Association in the Polish Republic (). Karaites live primarily in and around Warsaw, Wroc≈Çaw and Tricity; they are linguistically assimilated. In 2016, the Religious Council of Karaite Jews unanimously reelected their chief rabbi, Rabbi Moshe Piroz, for another four-year term. Piroz has been serving as chief rabbi since 2011. Karaism in Rabbinic Jewish opinion Rabbinic Judaism's scholars, such as Maimonides, write that people who deny the divine authority of the Oral Torah are to be considered among the heretics. However, at the same time, Maimonides holds (Hilkhot Mamrim 3:3) that most of the Karaites and others who claim to deny the \\"oral teachings\\" are not to be held accountable for their errors in the law because they are led into error by their parents and are similar to a tinok shenishba (a captive baby), or to one who was forced.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Judges, Laws of Rebels, 3:3 Rabbinic scholars have traditionally held that, because the Karaites do not observe the rabbinic law on divorce, there is a strong presumption that they are mamzerim (adulterine bastards), so that marriage with them is forbidden even if they return to Rabbinic Judaism. Some recent Ashkenazi ·∏§aredi scholars have held that Karaites should be regarded as Gentiles in all respects, though this is not universally accepted. They hasten to add that this opinion is not intended to insult the Karaites, but only to give individual Karaites the option of integrating into mainstream Judaism by way of conversion. In contrast, in 1971, Ovadia Yosef, who was then the Chief Rabbi of the Sefaradim and ‚ÄòEdot HaMizra·∏• of Israel, proclaimed that Egyptian Karaites are Jews and that it is permissible for Rabbinic Jews to marry with them. In response to the position taken by the Karaites in regards to the authority of the Talmud, Orthodox Judaism counters first that the majority of the Oral Law codified in the Mishnah and Talmud are the legal rulings of the last Sanhedrin, a body of 71 elders that made up the highest court of jurisprudence in ancient Israel, and that not all of the Oral Law are literally \\"Laws given to Moses on Mount Sinai\\". The decisions made by this High Court must be upheld, per se the Law of Moses (Deuteronomy 17), this gives their legal rulings divine authority. Karaites reject the authority of this Sanhedrin that developed during the second Temple period partly because it was an admixture of different people and not just priests and levites as mandated by the Torah. The Sanhedrin also took legal authority away from the descendants of Zadok who served as priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. This is essentially the same view held by the Sadducees and Boethusians during the second Temple period. Secondly Rabbinic Judaism points to the innumerable examples of biblical commandments that are either too ambiguous or documented in such a concise fashion that proper adherence could not be enforced on a national scale without the further legislation provided by the Talmud. Karaites respond that the Torah itself states \\"this law I am commanding you is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. It is not in the heavens, to say, who shall ascend into the heavens and bring it to us, and cause us to understand it, that we do it?\\" indicating the Torah could easily be understood by the average Israelite. Examples cited in Rabbinic Judaism as laws requiring rabbinic explanation include:Rietti, Rabbi Jonathan. The Oral Law: The Heart of The Torah *Tefillin: As indicated in Deuteronomy 6:8 among other places, tefillin are to be placed on the arm and on the head between the eyes. However, there are no details provided regarding what tefillin are or how they are to be constructed. Karaites, however, argue that since other passages in the Tanakh with similar language are read metaphorically, the verses from which the Rabbis derive the law of tefillin should also be read metaphorically. *Kashrut laws: As indicated in Exodus 23:19 among other places, a kid may not be boiled in its mother's milk. In addition to numerous other problems with understanding the ambiguous nature of this law, there are no vowelization characters in the Torah; they are provided by the Masoretic tradition. This is particularly relevant to this commandment, as the Hebrew word for milk is identical to the word for fat when vowels are absent. Without the oral tradition, it is not known whether the violation is in mixing meat with milk or with fat. Karaites maintain the vowels of the text have been preserved by the Masorites who themselves were Karaites. *Shabbat laws: With the severity of Sabbath violation, namely the death penalty, one would assume that direction would be provided as to how exactly such a serious and core commandment should be upheld. However, there is little to no information as to what can and cannot be performed on the Sabbath. Karaites, nonetheless, do keep the Shabbat according to their own traditions and interpretations, as described in the section above. *Mezuzah: Deuteronomy 6:9 is sometimes interpreted to mean that a mezuzah needs to be placed on the doorposts of a house. However, there are no details regarding where on the doorpost, if it is all doorposts or just one, what words go in it, how the words should be written or how the mezuzah should be constructed. As with the passage from which the rabbis derive the tradition of teffilin Karaites state this passage is also intended to be understood metaphorically and not literally. Orthodox Judaism also notes that the Torah was never meant to be observed as a personal covenant between the individual Jew and God, but a national covenant wherein the Torah functions as the constitution of Israel as a whole. Orthodox Jews point out that the Torah could never be enforced as a national law, as it was during the time of Joshua, King David, and Ezra, if every individual Jew had their own opinion on how to observe its commandments. In order for the Torah to properly govern the Jewish people, and for its laws be legally enforced with the punishments and penalties prescribed in the Torah, those laws must be legislated and clearly defined by a ruling Sanhedrin. Karaites counter that the enforcement of the Torah on a national scale can only be legislated by the descendants of Zadok in the Temple in Jerusalem as per the Torah (Deuteronomy 17) and prophets (Ezekiel 44) not by a collection of opinions by various rabbis. For Karaites, in sum, the rabbinic interpretations above, as codified in oral law, are only one form of interpretation. They are not divinely ordained, and they are neither binding halakhah nor practical religious law. Rabbinical classification of a Jew A person whose mother was a Karaite Jew is regarded as halakhically Jewish by the Orthodox Rabbinate. By contrast, somebody who is patrilineally Jewish (one whose father is Jewish) is regarded as a Jew by the Mo‚Ä≤e·π£et Ha·∏§akhamim (the Karaite Council of Sages) on the condition that they were raised Jewish during childhood. Although it is widely accepted that Karaite Jews are halakhically Jewish (apparently with the exception of those who join the Jewish people through the Karaite movement), there is still a question as to whether or not marriage between the Karaite and Rabbinite communities is permitted. Two Sephardi chief rabbis, Eliyahu Bakshi-DoronTehumin 18, 20 and Ovadia YosefYabia Omer EH 8:12 encouraged such marriages, hoping it would help Karaites to assimilate into mainstream Judaism. Maimonides decreed that Jews raised in a Karaite household are considered to be Tinoq she'Nishba, like babies taken captive by non-Jews; they cannot be punished for their supposedly wayward behavior, because it is the result of their parents' influence.Hilkhot Mamrim 3:2‚Äì3 Since the early 2010s, there has been a resurgence in the questioning of the Jewish identity of Karaites by Israel's chief rabbinate. According to the rabbinate's spokesman, \\"Israel is a Jewish state and Jews have superior rights. But the Karaites are not Jewish.\\" This has led to protestations from R. Moshe Firrouz, head of the Karaites' Council of Sages, that \\"the rabbinate is denying us our religious freedom.\\" See also * Criticism of the Talmud * Letter to the Falashas * Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon * Quranism * Rabbinic Judaism ‚Äì the primary branch of Judaism since the Bar Kokhba revolt; the primary contrast to modern Karaite Judaism. * Sola scriptura * List of Karaite Jews ** Aharon ben Mosheh ben Asher ‚Äì refiner of the Tiberian writing system, regarded as having produced the most accurate version of the Masoretic Text ** ‚ÄòAnan ben David ‚Äì founder of the Ananites, a group that became a part of the Karaite movement ** Elijah Bashyazi ** Benjamin al-Nahawandi ‚Äì regarded by some as the proper originator of Karaism ** Mordecai Sultansky \\\\- prominent nineteenth century scholar * Crimean Karaites Notes References Further reading * Astren, Fred (2004).

He also served as an Italian admiral during World War I.Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 5 He created the homonymous village in Italian Somalia during his last years of life. Early years He was born in Madrid, Spain as the third oldest son of Prince Amadeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta and his first wife Donna Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo della Cisterna. Prince Luigi Amedeo was a grandson of King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy. He was born during his father's brief reign as King Amadeo of Spain. His siblings are Prince Emanuele Filiberto, Prince Vittorio Emanuele, and Prince Umberto. Shortly after his birth, his father, who had reigned in Spain since 1870, abdicated and returned to Italy in 1873. Prince Luigi Amedeo was a member of the House of Savoy, well known in Europe since the 12th century. His uncle became King Umberto I of Italy in 1878, and his cousin became King Vittorio Emanuele III in 1900. The title Duke of the Abruzzi (Italian: Duca degli Abruzzi) was created by King Umberto I in 1890 for Luigi Amedeo, who was a son of the abdicating King of Spain Amadeus and initially was given the title of Infante of Spain. His ducal title referred to the central Italian region of Abruzzo. From 1893 to 1896, Luigi Amedeo traveled around the world, including Eritrea, then an Italian possession, and Vancouver. In September 1893, he traveled to Italian Somaliland to quell the unrest and stayed for a month to guard the port of Mogadishu, giving him his first contact with a land to which he would later devote the last years of his life and in which he would choose to die. He had begun to train as a mountaineer in 1892 on Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa (Italian Alps): in 1897 he made the first ascent of Mount Saint Elias (Canada/U.S., 5,489 m). There the expedition searched for a mirage, known as the Silent City of Alaska, that natives and prospectors claimed to see over a glacier. C. W. Thornton, a member of the expedition, wrote: \\"It required no effort of the imagination to liken it to a city, but was so distinct that it required, instead, faith to believe that it was not in reality a city.\\" Another witness wrote in The New York Times: \\"We could plainly see houses, well-defined streets, and trees. Here and there rose tall spires over huge buildings which appeared to be ancient mosques or cathedrals.\\" Arctic expedition In 1898, Prince Luigi Amedeo organized an expedition towards the North Pole and consulted the famous polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen that had sailed the furthest north with the Colin Archer-built polar ship in 1893‚Äì1896. In 1899 Amedeo acquired , a steam whaler of 570 tons. He renamed her Stella Polare and took her to Colin Archer's shipyard in Larvik, Norway. The interior was stripped out and beams, diagonals and knees heavily strengthened the ship. In spring 1899 he arrived in the Norwegian capital Christiania (the present day Oslo) with ten companions and Stella Polare (\\"Pole Star\\") took the expedition through the frozen sea. On 12 June they headed for Archangel (Arkhangelsk). Stella Polare was trapped and threatened to sink. The crew were obliged to land with the utmost haste and to secure materials for building a dwelling. On 30 June Stella Polare dropped anchor in the docks of Arkhangelsk and the duke was solemnly received by governor Engelhardt. The same day, Prince Luigi Amedeo was invited to meet the local authorities and the present foreign diplomats. On 7 July, a local newspaper wrote: :The city theatre arranged an extraordinary spectacle in the presence of the Duke of the Abruzzi. The drama The princess of Baghdad, consisting of three acts, was performed. Before the curtain was raised the orchestra had played the Italian royal anthem‚Ä¶ Later the duke himself wrote about his stay in Arkhangelsk: \\"Our departure was set for July 12. Early in the morning the church was open to us and we, although being Catholic, were allowed to join the mass. In the afternoon all the dogs were brought back on board to their kennels. In the evening the Stella Polare put out and was escorted by two steamers down the Dvina. I still remained on shore, as well as Doctor Cavalli, in order to spend the evening together with our Italian friends. Next evening we left Arkhangel‚Äôsk. During the whole journey we saw flags being hoisted to welcome us‚Ä¶\\" Twenty men took part in the expedition, among them Captain Umberto Cagni, Lieutenant F. Querini and Doctor A. Cavalli Molinelli. They planned to go to Franz Joseph Land, in the Arctic wilderness, to establish a camp in which to stay during wintertime and, afterwards, to reach the North Pole by dogsled across the frozen sea. Prince Luigi Amedeo established the winter camp on Rudolf Island. The expedition was to start at the end of the Arctic night. The duke lost two fingers during winter because of the cold, which made it impossible for him to join the trip by sled. He left the command over the pole expedition to Captain Cagni. On 11 March 1900 Cagni left the camp and reached latitude 86¬∞ 34‚Äô on 25 April, setting a new record by beating Nansen's result of 1895 by . Cagni barely managed to return to the camp on 23 June. On 16 August Stella Polare left Rudolf Island heading south and the expedition returned to Norway. During the expedition the northern coast of Rudolf Island and two other islands were explored and measured. Later years In 1906, inspired by Henry Morton Stanley's last wishes, the Duke led an expedition to the Ruwenzori Range (5,125 m), in Uganda. He scaled sixteen summits in the range, including the six principal peaks. One of them, Mount Luigi di Savoia, bears his name. The highest peak was reached on 18 June 1906. The Duke and his guides climbing an icefall on Chogolisa in 1909. The next great expedition, in 1909, aimed to climb K2 in Karakoram. A team led by Prince Luigi Amedeo reached a height of 6,250 m on the ridge in 1909. The standard route up the mountain (formerly known as K2's East Ridge) climbs today on the Abruzzi Spur. In an attempt on Chogolisa he and his companions again failed to reach the summit, but set a world altitude record.  In the Italian Navy  A vice-admiral in the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina), he was Inspector of Torpedo Craft from 1911 to 1912. During World War I, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Fleet (1914‚Äì1917) based in Taranto, his flagship being the . Under the duke, the Regia Marina was responsible for saving the Army of the Kingdom of Serbia.Time Magazine, Milestones In February 1917, he was replaced by Paolo Thaon di Revel, under pressure of the British and French allies. In February 1918, he was promoted to admiral, but played no role of importance anymore. The Explorers Club in New York elected the duke to its highest category of membership ‚Äî Honorary Member ‚Äî in 1912. The duke assisted Italian dictator Benito Mussolini with the Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928. He traveled to Addis Ababa with gifts.Time Magazine, Fascist New Year One gift, a Fiat 3000 tank, ended up playing a role in crushing the abortive coup d'√©tat of 1928.Time Magazine, Smooth Show In 1932, the duke was briefly the president of the newly merged Italian Line of steamships. In 1931, combining all of Italy's transatlantic carriers into the Italian Line was one of Mussolini's biggest business deals. However, the duke resigned soon after broke down at Gibraltar. According to him, \\"My reason is that I have been unable to achieve harmony among executives who formerly headed competing lines.\\"Time Magazine, Royal Resignation Italian Somaliland In 1918, the Duke returned to Italian Somaliland. In 1920, he founded the \\"Village of the Duke of Abruzzi\\" (Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi or Villabruzzi) some ninety kilometres north of Mogadishu. It was an agricultural settlement experimenting with new cultivation techniques. By 1926, the colony comprised 16 villages, with 3,000 Somali and 200 Italian (Italian Somalis) inhabitants. Abruzzi raised funds for a number of development projects in the town, including roads, dams, schools, hospitals, a church and a mosque. He died in the village on 18 March 1933. In the late 1930s the village area was one of the most socio-economically developed in eastern Africa. The area around the \\"Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi\\" was the most agriculturally developed of Somalia before World War II and had some important food industries. Villabruzzi (in Italian) After Italian Somaliland was officially dissolved in 1947, the town was later renamed to Jowhar.

His brother, Emanuele Filiberto, to whom Luigi was very close, persuaded him to give up the relationship.Aosta very ill His brother later approved of young Antoinette \\"Amber\\" Brizzi, the daughter of Quinto Brizzi, one of the largest vineyard owners in northern Italy.

The closest anchorage to Cockburn Town is Hawk's Nest Anchorage, which, though sheltered, should only be entered in good light because of reefs near the entrance. History The seat of government ever since 1766, Cockburn Town was the first permanent settlement on any of the islands, founded in 1681 by salt collectors who arrived in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The city supposedly lies on the place where Juan Ponce de Le√≥n first landed on the island. Main sights National Museum National Museum on Front Street Cockburn Town is home to the Turks & Caicos National Museum, which is housed in the colonial-era Guinep House, on Front Street. The house is believed to be over 180 years old and much of its structural material came from local shipwrecks, including a ship's mast, which is one of the building's main supports. The site was donated to the Museum in 1990.\\"Guinep House\\". Turks & Caicos National Museum. Retrieved January 29, 2010.

C. (2008). Longman Pronunciation Dictionary, 3rd edn, Harlow, UK: LongmanDaniel Jones, Peter Roach, et al. (2011). Cambridge Pronouncing Dictionary, 18th edn, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press) is a London Underground station on Plaistow Road in the London Borough of Newham in Greater London. It is between West Ham and Upton Park stations on the District and Hammersmith & City lines, and in Travelcard Zone 3. History The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway direct line from Bow to Barking was constructed east to west through the middle of the Parish of West Ham in 1858. Before this, trains took a longer route to the north via Stratford and Forest Gate on the Eastern Counties Railway's line. The new line opened with stations initially at Bromley, Plaistow and East Ham. Upton Park was added as a new station to the east in 1877 and West Ham was added to the west in 1901. From 18 May 1869 the North London Railway ran a daily service to Plaistow via the Bow‚ÄìBromley curve, terminating at the northern bay platform. In 1905 the service switched to a new bay platform on the southern side.The London & Tilbury Railway vol 1 page 41 by Peter Kay The North London Railway service to Plaistow ceased on 1 January 1916. With the completion of the Whitechapel and Bow Railway in 1902 the line was doubled to four tracks and through services of the Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) were able to operate to Upminster. The District Railway converted to electric trains in 1905 and services were cut back to East Ham. The District Railway was incorporated into London Transport in 1933, and became known as the District line. The 1947 timetable shows only a few services a day on the main lines and a frequent service provided by the District line. The remaining Fenchurch Street‚ÄìSouthend services were withdrawn in 1962 when the LT&SR; route was electrified with overhead lines. Ownership of the station passed to the Midland Railway in 1912 and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948 management of the station passed to British Railways. In 1969 ownership was transferred to the London Underground. Design The station has three platforms in use, two through platforms and a third bay platform enabling eastbound trains to terminate and reverse back to central London. Two other platforms used to serve the LTSR line but are now closed and derelict; c2c trains pass through non-stop. Plaistow used to have sidings on the north side of the line, but the site is now occupied by a Dagenham Motors car showroom. The station booking hall, built in 1905, is the subject of a local listing which, while not conferring any additional planning controls on a building under current legislation, encourages the proper consideration of a building's architectural or historic interest(s) in the exercise of normal planning controls. Works and engine sheds Plaistow railway works were built adjacent to the station on the north side of the line to the west of the station in 1879 to 1880. A separate engine shed was opened in 1899 adjoining the western end of the works. The locomotive works closed in 1925, with responsibility being transferred to Bow railway works which were a short distance away. Carriage and wagon work lasted until 1932 when that work was transferred to Wolverton railway works. On 30 September 1911 a new depot‚Äîinitially called \\"West Ham\\"‚Äîopened on the south side of the line and this became a Midland Railway depot in 1912 when the Midland Railway took over the London Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) and then a London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) shed in 1923 following the grouping, when it was allocated the 13a depot code. Following nationalization in 1948 the depot was initially part of British Railways London Midland Region, although on 20 February 1949 it transferred to the Eastern Region. The depot code was changed to 33A which it retained until closure in 1962 following electrification of the LTSR system. In 1950 Plaistow had an allocation of 83 locomotives, the majority (70) of which were tank engines for passenger traffic to and from Fenchurch Street with 6 freight engines and 7 shunting engines making up the balance. Location Although there is no station car park, there is a Newham London Borough Council-run pay and display car park to the immediate south, connected by a set of steps. Buses London Buses routes 69, 241, 262, 325 and 473 serve the station, providing connections to Canning Town, East Beckton, North Woolwich, Prince Regent, Stratford, Stratford City and Walthamstow.

Irons (born August 11, 1940) is an American political activist, civil rights attorney, legal scholar, and professor emeritus of political science. He has written many books on the U.S. Supreme Court and constitutional litigation.  Education  Irons graduated from Antioch College (an early incubator of progressive politics). He embarked on his current path in 1963 when he was sentenced to three years imprisonment at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut for refusing military induction on the ground that the Federal government perpetuated racial discrimination. While serving most of that sentence, he began corresponding with Howard Zinn, who sent him books on civil liberties and American politics. His conviction was ultimately reversed by a federal judge on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct. Later, President Gerald Ford granted him a pardon for refusing induction.  Career  Irons completed a Ph.D. at Boston University in 1973. Afterwards, Zinn helped arrange for him to work at a law firm defending Daniel Ellsberg, who was under federal prosecution at the time for stealing the Pentagon Papers. His work at the law firm would later serve as motivation for him to pursue a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School, which he received in 1978. Upon graduating, he taught at Boston College Law School and the University of Massachusetts before moving to the University of California, San Diego. There in 1982 he established the Earl Warren Bill of Rights Project, of which he is the director. He was chosen in 1988 as the first Raoul Wallenberg Distinguished Visiting Professor of Human Rights at Rutgers University. He has lectured on constitutional law and civil liberties at the law schools of Harvard, Yale, Berkeley, Stanford, and more than 20 other schools. He was also elected to two terms on the national board of the American Civil Liberties Union. In addition to teaching and authoring several books, he has also helped reopen the wartime internment cases of Fred Korematsu, Minoru Yasui, and Gordon Hirabayashi. He is an Emeritus Professor of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego and an author on legal history. He retired from the University in 2004 and now devotes some of his time to causes that interest him. He has undertaken some legal work in issues of the separation of church and state and written some articles for the Montana Law Review. Starting in 1989, Irons represented the plaintiffs in the Mount Soledad case in San Diego, pro bono. He discontinued his involvement in the case in 1998 when threats made him fear for the safety of his two daughters.

Saint Elias from Icy Bay Mount Saint Elias, also designated Boundary Peak 186, is the second highest mountain in both Canada and the United States, being situated on the Yukon and Alaska border. It lies about southwest of Mount Logan, the highest mountain in Canada. The Canadian side is part of Kluane National Park and Reserve, while the U.S. side of the mountain is located within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. Its name in Tlingit is Yas º√©it ºaa Shaa, meaning \\"mountain behind Icy Bay\\", and is occasionally called Shaa Tlein \\"Big Mountain\\" by the Yakutat Tlingit. It is one of the most important crests of the Kwaashk ºi·∏µw√°an clan since they used it as a guide during their journey down the Copper River. Mount Fairweather at the apex of the British Columbia and Alaska borders at the head of the Alaska Panhandle is known as TsalxÃ±aan, it is said this mountain and Yas º√©it ºaa Shaa (Mt. St. Elias) were originally next to each other but had an argument and separated. Their children, the mountains in between the two peaks, are called TsalxÃ±aan Y√°tx ºi (\\"Children of Tsalxaan\\"). The mountain was first sighted by European explorers on July 16, 1741 by Vitus Bering, a Danish explorer in service of Russia. While some historians contend that the mountain was named by Bering, others believe that eighteenth century mapmakers named it after Cape Saint Elias, when it was left unnamed by Bering. Mount Saint Elias is notable for its immense vertical relief. Its summit rises vertically in just horizontal distance from the head of Taan Fjord, off of Icy Bay. In 2007, an Austrian documentary, Mount. St. Elias, was made about a team of skier/mountaineers determined to make \\"the planet's longest skiing descent\\" ‚Äì ascending the mountain and then skiing nearly all 18,000 feet down to the Gulf of Alaska; the movie finished editing and underwent limited release in 2009. The climbers ended up summiting on the second attempt and skiing down to .  Climbing history  Mt. St. Elias was first climbed on July 31, 1897 by an Italian expedition led by famed explorer Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, (who also reconnoitered the current standard route on K2 in 1909) and included noted mountain photographer Vittorio Sella. The second ascent was not until 1946, when a group from the Harvard Mountaineering Club including noted mountain historian Dee Molenaar climbed the Southwest Ridge route. The summit party comprised Molenaar, his brother Cornelius, Andrew and Betty Kauffman, Maynard Miller, William Latady, and Benjamin Ferris. William Putnam was a member of the expedition but did not make the summit. They used eleven camps, eight of which were on the approach from Icy Bay, and three of which were on the mountain. They were supported by multiple air drops of food. The first winter ascent was made on February 13, 1996 by David Briggs, Gardner Heaton and Joe Reichert. After being flown by pilots Steve Ranney and Gary Graham, in to on the Tyndal Glacier, they climbed the southwest ridge and followed the \\"Milk Bowl\\" variation in order to avoid 2,000 feet of loose rock on the normal route. The team had originally planned to begin their ascent from the ocean and cross the Tyndal Glacier but the terrain was in very poor condition. Mount Saint Elias is infrequently climbed today, despite its height, because it has no easy route to the summit and because of its prolonged periods of bad weather (mainly snow and low visibility).

It has an estimated 550 to 850 members. The NLFT seeks to secede from India and establish an independent Tripuri state, and is an active participant in the Insurgency in Northeast India. According to Manik Sarkar, former Chief Minister of Tripura, The NLFT manifesto says that they want to expand what they describe as the Kingdom of God and Jesus Christ in Tripura. The NLFT is currently designated as a terrorist organisation in India.  History  The Baptist Church of Tripura was initially set up by missionaries from New Zealand in the 1940s. Despite their efforts, even until the 1980s, only a few thousand people in Tripura had converted to Christianity. In the aftermath of one of the worst ethnic riots, the NLFT was born in 1989 with the backing of the Baptist Church of Tripura. Since then, the NLFT has been advancing its cause through armed rebellion. In its constitution, the organisation claims to represent the indigenous population which it claims has been marginalised by \\"the subjugation policy of imperialist Hindustani (India)\\"; its constitution makes no mention of any specific religion and claims to extend membership to \\"any person irrespective of caste, sex or creed\\". The NLFT has been described as engaging in terrorist violence motivated by their Christian beliefs. The NLFT is listed as a terrorist organisation in the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002. The state government contends that the Baptist Church of Tripura supplies arms and gives financial support to the NLFT. In April 2000, according to the state government, the secretary of the Noapara Baptist Church in Tripura, Nagmanlal Halam, was arrested with explosives and confessed that for two years he had been buying explosives for the NLFT. In 2000, the NLFT threatened to kill Hindus celebrating the religious festival of Durga Puja. At least 20 Hindus in Tripura have been killed by the NLFT in two years for resisting forced conversion to Christianity. A leader of the Jamatia tribe, Rampada Jamatia, said that armed NLFT militants were forcibly converting tribal villagers to Christianity, which he said was a serious threat to Hinduism. It is believed that as many as 5,000 tribal villagers were forcibly converted from 1999 to 2001. These forcible conversions to Christianity, sometimes including the use of \\"rape as a means of intimidation,\\" were noted by academics outside of India in 2007. In early 2000, 16 Bengali Hindus were killed by the NLFT at Gourangatilla. On 20 May 2000, the NLFT killed 25 Bengali Hindus at the Bagber refugee camp. In August 2000, a tribal Hindu spiritual leader, Shanti Kali, was shot dead by about ten NLFT guerrillas who said it wanted to convert all people in the state to Christianity. In December 2000, Labh Kumar Jamatia, a religious leader of the state's second largest Hindu group, was kidnapped by the NLFT, and found dead in a forest in Dalak village in southern Tripura. According to police, rebels from the NLFT wanted Jamatia to convert to Christianity, but he refused. A local Marxist tribal leader, Kishore Debbarma, was clubbed to death in Tripura's Sadar by militants from the Biswamohan faction of the NLFT in May 2005. In 2001, there were 826 reported terrorist attacks in Tripura, in which 405 people lost their lives and 481 kidnappings were made by the NLFT and related organisations such as the Christian All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTP). Nagmanlal Halam, secretary of the Noapara Baptist Church in Tripura, was arrested for and confessed, under torture from police, to providing munitions and financial aid to the NLFT from 1998 until 2000. The BBC reported in 2005 that independent investigations as well as confessions from surrendered members showed that the NLFT had been making and selling pornography to finance their activities. This includes DVDs of pornographic films made by the group with tribal men and women kidnapped and forced to participate in sex acts while being filmed. The movies are dubbed into various languages and sold illegally throughout the region for a profit. Statements from former members and one report state that the NLFT has a history of sexually abusing tribal women. According to the Institute for Conflict Management, approximately 90% of the NLFT's administration are Christians. Factions The NLFT was originally started by Dhananjoy Reang in March of 1989. Reang was removed from his position by a coup in 1993. After the coup, the group was briefly led by Nayanbasi Jamatiya, and then Biswamohan Debbarma took command, but some continued to follow Nayanbasi. Cited causes of internal conflicts include the reluctance of Biswamohan Debbarma's Central Executive Committee to nominate Joshua Debbarma as the King of ‚ÄòTripura Kingdom‚Äô; misappropriation of funds by senior leaders; lavish lifestyles led by the senior leadership; and forcible conversion of tribal cadres/civilians to Christianity. Other leaders of the original NLFT included ‚ÄòVice President‚Äô Kamini Debbarma, ‚ÄòPublicity Secretary‚Äô Binoy Debbarma, ‚ÄòChief of Army‚Äô Dhanu Koloi, and ‚ÄòFinance Secretary‚Äô Bishnu Prasad Jamatiya. Biswamohan faction The Biswamohan faction (NLFT/BM) is earlier headed by Biswamohan Debbarma. In May 2017 In a meeting at an undisclosed location, selected Subir Debbarma alias Yamorok (45), as the new 'president' of the organization renaming it as the NLFT SD. It later signed a memorandum of Settlement with Government of India to abide by The Constitution of India & join the mainstream on 10 August 2019.. Upon the surrender of Mantu Koloi, second in command, he requested that Biswamohan Debbarma and Ranjit Debbarma engage in talks with the Government of India to resolve the crisis. This was sparked by the Bangladeshi government‚Äôs crackdown on hostile groups. The government there were able to do this by extensively searching the Sacherri jungles where the organization had many of its hideouts. However, both leaders vowed to fight on. Nayanbasi faction The Nayanbasi faction has approximately 50 sophisticated weapons, 50 persons in collaboration with the group, and 150 cadres in active duty.In January of 2004, the Nayanbasi faction group sent a message to the Additional Director of General Police (ADG) with the intention to start peace talks. These meetings ultimately were not successful. Later that year it peacefully entered into a Memorandum of Settlement with India. Location The group has been banned from the Indian government since the Unlawful Activities Act of 1967. Therefore, the group operates from its headquarters in Khagrachari, a district in Bangladesh around 45 km from Simanapur. The National Liberation Front of Tripura has the ability to utilize this 856 km of the border that is unfenced and susceptible to invasion. Attacks The National Liberation Front of Tripura has conducted 81 attacks on various locations in South Asia and specifically in Tripura. Of these 81 attacks, handguns and firearms have been the most common weapon. The attacks that have been carried out by the NLFT have not exceeded 25 deaths. The majority of their attacks have been on citizens rather than the government although the group‚Äôs main opponent is the Indian government. Objectives/Ideologies A common ideology within the NLFT is Tripuri Nationalism. This has two components: a Tripura state that is for only the native citizens, and the Bengalis that inhabit Tripura have no political rights or power. Among the leadership and followers of the NLFT, there are a few common objectives that come to the surface when doing analysis on this group. # To liberate Tripura from the union of India # To deport all foreigners who entered into Tripura after 1956. # To restore alienated tribal lands  Peace Accord  Tripura Peace Accord is the tripartite accord signed- in on 10 August 2019 by the Government of India, Government of Tripura and the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) to end the insurgency. The tripartite memorandum of understanding was signed by Satyendra Garg, Joint Secretary (Northeast) of Ministry of Home Affairs, Kumar Alok, Additional Chief Secretary (Home), Tripura and Sabir Kumar Debbarma and Kajal Debbarma of NLFT. Flag The NLFT has its own flag which consists of three colors: green, white, and red. The green portion of the flag symbolizes sovereignty over Tripura, the land to which they lay claim. The white portion of the flag signifies the peace they desire to. The color red represents the revolution and the blood that has been shed in the name of their revolution. The final part of the flag is the star which acts as the guiding light for the Borok during this struggle.

Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef). Etymology The 1492 indigenous people of the Bahamas were called \\"Lucayan\\", an Anglicization of the Spanish Lucayos, derived in turn from the Ta√≠no Lukku-Cairi (which the people used for themselves), meaning \\"people of the islands\\". The Ta√≠no word for \\"island\\", cairi, became cayo in Spanish and \\"cay\\" in English (spelled \\"key\\" in American English, \\"caye\\" in Belizean English).Albury:5, 13‚Äì14 Craton:17 Keegan:11 Formation and composition Cay sand under an optical microscope A cay forms when ocean currents transport loose sediment across the surface of a reef to a depositional node, where the current slows or converges with another current, releasing its sediment load. Gradually, layers of deposited sediment build up on the reef surface. Such nodes occur in windward or leeward areas of reef where surfaces sometimes occur around an emergent outcrop of old reef or beach rock. The island resulting from sediment accumulation is made up almost entirely of biogenic sediment ‚Äì the skeletal remains of plants and animals ‚Äì from the surrounding reef ecosystems. If the accumulated sediments are predominantly sand, then the island is called a cay; if they are predominantly gravel, the island is called a motu. Cay sediments are largely composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), primarily of aragonite, calcite, and high magnesium calcite. They are produced by myriad plants (e.g., coralline algae, species of the green algae Halimeda) and animals (e.g., coral, molluscs, foraminifera). Small amounts of silicate sediment are also contributed by sponges and other creatures. Over time, soil and vegetation may develop on a cay surface, assisted by the deposition of sea bird guano. Development and stability A range of physical, biological and chemical influences determines the ongoing development or erosion of cay environments. These influences include: the extent of reef surface sand accumulations, changes in ocean waves, currents, tides, sea levels and weather conditions, the shape of the underlying reef, the types and abundance of carbonate producing biota and other organisms such as binders, bioeroders and bioturbators (creatures that bind, erode, and mix sediments) living in surrounding reef ecosystems. Significant changes in cays and their surrounding ecosystems can result from natural phenomena such as severe El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles. Also, tropical cyclones can help build or destroy these islands. There is much debate and concern over the future stability of cays in the face of growing human populations and pressures on reef ecosystems, and predicted climate changes and sea level rise. There is also debate around whether these islands are relict features that effectively stopped expanding two thousand years ago during the late Holocene or, as recent research suggests, they are still growing, with significant new additions of reef sediments. Understanding the potential for change in the sediment sources and supply of cay beaches with environmental change is an important key to predicting their present and future stability. Despite, or perhaps because of all the debate around the future of cays, there is consensus that these island environments are very complex and somewhat fragile. Examples Warraber Island, Torres Strait Examples of cays include: * The Florida Keys are composed primarily of exposed ancient coral reefs and oolite beds formed behind reefs.

He was the grandson of John IV, Duke of Brittany. A recurring theme in Francis' life would be his quest to maintain the quasi-independence of Brittany from France. As such, his reign was characterized by conflicts with King Louis XI of France and with his daughter, Anne of France, who served as regent during the minority of her brother, King Charles VIII. The armed and unarmed conflicts between 1484‚Äì1488 have been called the Mad War (la Guerre Folle) and also the \\"War of the Public Weal\\". Early life Francis II was born on 23 June 1433 to Richard of Brittany, Count of √âtampes (1395‚Äì1438) and his wife, Margaret of Orl√©ans, Countess of Vertus (1406‚Äì1466). Richard of Brittany was the youngest son of Duke John IV of Brittany. Richard's older brothers, John V and Arthur III, both succeeded their father as duke, but upon Arthur's death in 1458 (John V's sons Francis I and Peter II died in 1450 and 1457 respectively, without sons), the only legitimate male heir was his nephew Francis II. Relationship with English royalty Protector of the House of Lancaster Duke Francis II unexpectedly became the protector of England's House of Lancaster in exile from 1471‚Äì1484. During the latter half of the 15th century, civil war existed in England as the House of York and House of Lancaster fought each other for the English throne. In 1471, the Yorkists defeated their rivals in the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury. The Lancastrian king, Henry VI of England and his only son, Edward of Westminster, died in the aftermath of the Battle of Tewkesbury. Their deaths left the House of Lancaster with no direct claimants to the throne. Subsequently, the Yorkist king, Edward IV of England, was in complete control of England. He attainted those who refused to submit to his rule, such as Jasper Tudor and his nephew Henry Tudor (later King Henry VII of England), naming them as traitors and confiscating their lands. The Tudors tried to flee to France but strong winds in the English Channel forced them to land at Le Conquet in Brittany, where they were taken into the custody of Duke Francis II. Henry Tudor, the only remaining Lancastrian noble with a trace of royal bloodline, had a weak claim to the throne, and King Edward IV regarded him as \\"a nobody\\". However, Francis II viewed Henry as a valuable tool to bargain for England's aid, when in conflicts with France, and therefore kept the Tudors under his protection. He housed Jasper Tudor, Henry Tudor, and the core of their group of exiled Lancastrians at the Ch√¢teau de Suscinio in Sarzeau, where they remained for 11 years. There, Francis II generously supported this group of exiled Englishmen against all the Plantagenet demands that he should surrender them. In October 1483, Henry Tudor launched a failed invasion of England from Brittany. Duke Francis II supported this invasion by providing 40,000 gold crowns, 15,000 soldiers, and a fleet of transport ships. Henry's fleet of 15 chartered vessels was scattered by a storm, and his ship reached the coast of England in company with only one other vessel. Henry realized that the soldiers on shore were the men of the new Yorkist king, Richard III of England, and so he decided to abandon the invasion and return to Brittany. As for Henry's main conspirator in England, Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, he was convicted of treason and beheaded on 2 November 1483, way before Henry's ships landed in England. For Henry's conspiracy against King Richard III had been unravelled, and without the Duke of Buckingham or Henry Tudor, the rebellion was easily crushed. Survivors of the failed uprising then fled to Brittany, where they openly supported Henry Tudor's claim to the throne. On Christmas Day in 1483 at the Rennes Cathedral, Henry swore an oath to marry King Edward IV's daughter, Elizabeth of York, and thus unite the warring houses of York and Lancaster. Henry's rising prominence made him a great threat to King Richard III, and the Yorkist king made several overtures to Duke Francis II to surrender the young Lancastrian. Francis II refused, holding out for the possibility of better terms from the King. In mid-1484, Francis was incapacitated by one of his periods of illness, and while recuperating, his treasurer, Pierre Landais, took over the reins of government. Landais reached an agreement with King Richard III to send Henry and his uncle Jasper back to England in exchange for a pledge of 3,000 English archers to defend Brittany against a threatened French attack. John Morton, a bishop of Flanders, learned of the scheme and warned the Tudors in time. The Tudors then managed to separately escape, hours ahead of Landais' soldiers, across the nearby border into France. They were received at the court of King Charles VIII of France, who allowed them to stay and provided them with resources. Shortly afterwards, when Francis II had recovered, he offered the 400 remaining Lancastrians, still at and around the Ch√¢teau de Suscinio, safe- conduct into France and even paid for their expenses. For the French, the Tudors were useful pawns to ensure that King Richard III did not interfere with French plans to acquire Brittany. Thus, the loss of the Lancastrians seriously played against the interests of Francis II. Titular Earl of Richmond Circa 1136, King Stephen of England named Alan of Penthi√®vre of Brittany (also known as Alan the Black) the 1st Earl of Richmond. After Alan, the title and its possessions (the Honour of Richmond) were typically bestowed upon the Dukes of Brittany, with a few interruptions, through the ducal reign of John IV, which ended in 1399. After John IV, the English kings would bestow the title Earl of Richmond on nobles other than the Dukes of Brittany, including Edmund Tudor, Henry Tudor's father. However the dukes of Brittany from John V through Francis II would continue to use the titulary Earl of Richmond. It is possible that Francis willed whatever remained of his claims to the earldom and the Honour of Richmond to Henry Tudor. On successfully gaining the English crown after the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, Henry VII merged the earldom and its possessions into the crown. The Tomb of Francis II Relationship with French royalty =King Louis XI= Louis XI was renowned as a cunning adversary and a master at diplomacy, if not the military arts. His contemporary nickname was \\"The Universal Spider,\\" reflecting his constant political plotting. Francis II became a member of the League of the Public Weal. This was an alliance of feudal nobles organized in 1465 in defiance of the centralized authority of King Louis XI of France, whose declared aim was to enlarge the French royal domain by annexing all of the duchies ‚Äì Burgundy, Berry, Normandy, Orl√©ans, Brittany, etc. It was masterminded by Charles the Bold, Count of Charolais, son of the Duke of Burgundy, with the king's brother Charles, Duke of Berry, as a figurehead. In 1467 Charles the Bold inherited the Duchy of Burgundy, which held fiefs in France that included the counties of Artois and Flanders, and the Imperial lands of Holland, Brabant, and Luxembourg. As Duke of Burgundy, Charles aspired to forge a kingdom of his own between France and Germany, approximating the former domains of the Frankish Emperor Lothair I. In pursuit of this goal, Charles was killed in 1477 at the Battle of Nancy against Ren√© II, Duke of Lorraine and a hired army of Swiss mercenaries, and Louis was saved from his greatest adversary. The great Duchy of Burgundy was then absorbed into the Kingdom of France, and the League of the Public Weal was essentially defeated, although several members would re-ally for the Mad War in 1485. The fortunes of Francis II and Brittany would continue to deteriorate after Louis XI's death in 1483, as his daughter Anne of France would serve as regent for putative successor Charles VIII. =Regency of Anne of France= Francis II was anxious to maintain his duchy's autonomy during the minority of Charles VIII of France. He aligned himself with Louis, the Duke of Orl√©ans (the future Louis XII) and Charles, Count of Angoul√™me, against the regency of Anne of France. She had been pursuing the same underhand politics towards Brittany as her father Louis XI. In focusing on relations with his neighbour France, however, Francis II neglected his own realm. His corrupt and oppressive prime minister, Guillaume Chauvin, was overthrown by treasurer general Pierre Landais in 1477. A large part of the nobility had been bribed by Anne and Charles and supported them in their eagerness to subjugate Brittany. These nobles performed a coup d'√©tat ousting Landais, who was eventually hanged in 1485. In 1486, the Estates of Brittany confirmed Francis' daughter Anne and heir and successor to further assure the Duchy's autonomy from France. The Treaty of Chateaubriant was signed with France in 1487 and reaffirmed Brittany's autonomy. Despite the Treaty of Chateaubriant, however, the French continued to harass the Duchy. Under the leadership of Louis II de la Tr√©moille, the French royal army struck against Vannes and Foug√®res, controlling access to Brittany. La Guerre Folle (The Mad War) Francis II then allied with Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, against France. Alain d'Albret, a rebel lord, believing he would marry Francis' daughter Anne, reinforced the Breton army with 5000 troops supplied by the king of Spain. Maximilian I of Austria also sent 1500 men, and Edward Woodville, Lord Scales, brought over a force of archers from Britain. However Brittany was defeated 28 July 1488 in the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier. This battle also destroyed the power-base of the warring noble leaders as Edward Woodville was killed, and Louis of Orl√©ans and Jean, Prince of Orange were captured. Alain d'Albret and the Mar√©chal de Rieux succeeded in escaping, and played an important part in continuing the conflict. A few days later, on 10 August, Francis was forced to sign the Treaty of Verger. Under the terms of the treaty, the duke was compelled to submit himself and his duchy as a vassal of the king of France, and to expel foreign princes and troops from Brittany. It also restricted his ability to marry his children to suitors of his choosing and required that he cede territory in Saint-Malo, Foug√®res, Dinan, and Saint-Aubin to the king as a guarantee that in the absence of a male successor the king would determine the succession. Francis died a few months later as a result of a fall from his horse during a leisurely ride. He left only a daughter, Anne of Brittany, so the treaty was used to force her, as his successor, to marry Charles VIII, and later Louis XII. Despite the French victory and the signing of the treaty, la Guerre Folle dragged on beyond Francis II's death for three more years until December 1491, when Anne married Charles VIII. Francis II is interred in an elaborate tomb in the Nantes Cathedral. His tomb was commissioned by his daughter Anne, and is an important early example of Renaissance sculpture in France. Family Francis II was married twice. His first wife was Margaret of Brittany, the eldest daughter of Francis I, Duke of Brittany (his first cousin) and Isabella of Scotland. They had one son who died shortly after his birth: * John, Count of Montfort (29 June ‚Äì 25 August 1463) His second wife was Margaret of Foix, Princess of Navarre, daughter of Gaston IV, Count of Foix and Queen Eleanor of Navarre. They had two children: * Anne of Brittany (1477‚Äì1514), his only legitimate heir to reach adulthood. * Isabeau of Brittany (1478‚Äì1490), betrothed to Jean d'Albret in 1481, died young, and was buried at the Rennes Cathedral. Francis II also had five illegitimate children with Antoinette de Maignelais, the former mistress of King Charles VII of France. Legacy Breton nobles acted to safeguard Anne as their Duchess and to protect the Duchy's autonomy for which Francis had fought so hard. In 1489 these nobles signed the Treaty of Redon with Henry VII; that treaty between Brittany and England was intended to prevent the annexation of Brittany by France. However, in 1491 Charles VIII of France invaded Brittany and forced Anne to marry him, thereby gaining control of the duchy. Then in 1492 Henry VII signed the Treaty of Etaples with France, effectively removing England's defense of Breton autonomy in return for promises from the French to no longer support Perkin Warbeck, pretender to the English throne, and to pay a war indemnity. The duchy's autonomy was all but lost as the process of merging it into the French crown began, and Brittany's strongest ally was neutralized. Anne, however, became a formidable queen consort and fought to preserve Brittany's autonomy and Francis II's legacy for herself, the Breton people, and her descendants.

He played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball, from 1991 through 2002, for the Minnesota Twins, New York Yankees, and Kansas City Royals. He played mostly as a second baseman before moving to left field for his final two seasons. Early years Born in Houston, Texas, Knoblauch came from a baseball family, as his uncle Eddie Knoblauch and father Ray Knoblauch played and managed in the minor leagues between the late 1930s and mid-1950s.Johnson, Lloyd (1994). The Minor League Register. Baseball America. Knoblauch played for the Bellaire High School baseball team, which also produced many other former major leaguers, including Chris Young (outfielder) and Jose Cruz, Jr.. Knoblauch missed his senior season (1986) due to a broken leg, but he cheered from the bench as the team won the state championship. Chuck was drafted in the 18th round of the 1986 amateur draft by the Philadelphia Phillies, but did not sign. Knoblauch went on to play college baseball for Texas A&M; University in College Station, where he was a second- team All-American. He later played on the 1989 team that finished the season with 58 wins, the highest total in school history. In 1988, Knoblauch played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), and received the league's Outstanding Pro Prospect award. In 2001, he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame. Major league career Minnesota Twins 1997 Minnesota Twins #11 Chuck Knoblauch home jersey Knoblauch was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the first round of the 1989 MLB draft. Knoblauch won the American League Rookie of the Year award and a World Series ring as a member of the 1991 Minnesota Twins. In game 7 of the World Series, Knoblauch attempted to deceive Lonnie Smith by appearing to start a double play on a Terry Pendleton double (causing Smith to get only to third base when he might have scored for the Atlanta Braves). Smith claimed that he lost track of the ball, and that Knoblauch's decoy was not a factor. During the 1994‚Äì96 seasons, Knoblauch batted .312, .333, and .341, respectively, won the AL Gold Glove Award at second base in 1997, and stole over 40 bases in three consecutive seasons. After the 1997 season, Knoblauch was traded to the Yankees in exchange for four players (including two future All-Stars, Eric Milton and Cristian Guzm√°n) and US$3 million. Once a popular player in Minnesota, his request to be traded from the Twins resulted in being booed on successive trips to the Metrodome. This included throwing hot dogs, bottles, and golf balls at Knoblauch during a visit to the Metrodome in 2001. New York Yankees Knoblauch's arrival in New York was greeted with anticipation. Buster Olney, then with The New York Times, predicted that Knoblauch and Derek Jeter would form the greatest double play combination in history. Though he struggled early on with the team, he hit a career-high 17 home runs as the Yankees won a then-American league-record 114 games. In game 2 of the 1998 American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians, Knoblauch was involved in an infamous defensive play. In the 12th inning with the score tied 1‚Äì1, Indians batter Travis Fryman bunted, and Knoblauch covered first base for a possible putout. Jeff Nelson's throw hit Fryman and rolled away, but instead of retrieving the ball, Knoblauch argued with the first-base umpire that interference should have been called, while the ball was still live. Indians baserunner Enrique Wilson was able to score from first base on the play, giving Cleveland the lead in an eventual 4‚Äì1 victory. A New York newspaper called Knoblauch a \\"Blauch-head\\". Knoblauch recovered and was an important factor in the World Series victory over the San Diego Padres, and the 1999 World Series victory over the Atlanta Braves. In game 3 of the 1999 World Series, Knoblauch scored the game's first run and hit a dramatic two-run home run in the eighth inning to tie the score, with the Yankees eventually winning in the 10th inning. In game 5 of 2001 World Series, Knoblauch scored the winning run, having led off the inning with a single and scoring on a single by his replacement at second base, Alfonso Soriano. The Yankees won the American League pennant every year he was with the team, winning three World Series championships. Kansas City Royals Towards the end of his career, Knoblauch's performance at the plate grew worse, with many observers believing he was preoccupied by his fielding troubles and trying too hard to hit home runs. Knoblauch was benched in the final game of the 2001 World Series (he hit just .056), and left for Kansas City as a free agent in the off season. Knoblauch played in just 80 games in left field for the Royals, batting .210, and the team declined to offer him a new contract the following year. In 2003, having failed to gain a job with an MLB team, Knoblauch announced his retirement. Throwing troubles Once considered one of the game's best fielders (in fact, ESPN personalities nicknamed him \\"Fundamentally Sound\\" Chuck Knoblauch), Knoblauch's play deteriorated shortly into his Yankee career; his errors at second doubled from 13 in 1998 to 26 the following year; all of these were throwing errors. In 2000, he began to have difficulty making accurate throws to first base, a condition sometimes referred to in baseball as the \\"yips\\" or \\"Steve Sax syndrome\\" in more recent years. Knoblauch tried various solutions to his problem, but his throwing did not improve. He made 15 errors in less than half a season in 2000, including 10 throwing miscues. (During one game, an errant throw sailed into the stands and hit sportscaster Keith Olbermann's mother in the head). After making three throwing errors in six innings of the Yankees' 12‚Äì3 loss to the Chicago White Sox, on 15 June 2000, Knoblauch voluntarily left the game. He then left Yankee Stadium in his street clothes while the game was still in progress. He was back at second the next day, but Knoblauch never fully recovered his throwing accuracy, especially after missing most of August with an injury. Knoblauch returned to the Yankees in September, but was often used as a designated hitter in lieu of playing second; he was exclusively a DH in the Yankees' run to a World Series title. Finally, in 2001, he was reassigned to left field by manager Joe Torre, never to return to his old position. Legal troubles On September 25, 2009, an officer from the Memorial Villages Police Department, near Houston, was told by Knoblauch's common-law wife, Stacey Victoria Stelmach, that he hit and choked her. A police officer's affidavit alleged that \\"redness around her neck and swelling near her eye [were] consistent with her statement.\\" On September 29, 2009, the Harris County, Texas District Attorney charged Knoblauch with assaulting a family member by choking, a third-degree felony in Texas. Knoblauch pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault in connection with the case on March 16, 2010. The couple was reportedly going through a divorce. On July 24, 2014, the 46-year-old Knoblauch was charged with assault of a family member, Cheri Knoblauch, whom he divorced in 2012. Due to this incident, the Twins cancelled the planned induction of Knoblauch into the Twins Hall of Fame. Legacy A four-time All-Star, in his career Knoblauch batted .289 with 98 home runs and 615 runs batted in. He stole 25 or more bases in 10 of his 12 seasons, finishing with 407 in his career ‚Äì including 276 with the Twins, the most for the team since its move from Washington in . On August 18, 2018, Knoblauch returned to the new Yankee Stadium to commemorate the 1998 championship team. HGH use In December 2007, Knoblauch was included in the Mitchell report, which provided evidence that he used performance-enhancing drugs during his career. In the Mitchell report, Brian McNamee stated that he procured human growth hormone (HGH) from Kirk Radomski for Knoblauch in 2001 when he served as the New York Yankees assistant strength coach. McNamee stated that during the season, he injected Knoblauch seven to nine times with HGH. McNamee states that Knoblauch paid Radomski for the drugs through him or Jason Grimsley, and also believed that Knoblauch obtained HGH from Grimsley. Knoblauch did not respond to a request to meet with the Mitchell investigators to discuss the allegations. On December 20, 2007, Knoblauch was named in Jason Grimsley's unsealed affidavit as an alleged user of HGH. Knoblauch and Grimsley were teammates on the Yankees from 1999 to 2000. On January 11, 2008, The New York Times published a look at Chuck Knoblauch's post-baseball life. The article painted Knoblauch's outlook on baseball and the Mitchell report as being apathetic. As he has been retired for 5 years, he expressed \\"bewilderment at his inclusion\\" in the report and stated, \\"I have nothing to defend and I have nothing to hide at the same time.\\" In 2008, Knoblauch owned a condominium and house in the Houston area, and was not interested in returning to pro baseball in any capacity. On January 22, 2008, Knoblauch was subpoenaed by the congressional committee investigating steroids in baseball after he failed to respond to an invitation to give a deposition by a January 18, 2008, deadline. On January 23, federal marshals had as yet been unable to find Knoblauch to serve him with the subpoena. On January 28, 2008, the congressional subpoena was withdrawn after Knoblauch agreed to provide a deposition on February 1, 2008. Knoblauch admitted to using HGH: \\"I did HGH. It didn't help me out. It didn't make me any better. I had the worst years of my career from a batting average standpoint. And I got hurt. So there was no good that came out of it for me‚Äîit was not performance-enhancing for me.\\" See also * List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual doubles leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders * List of Major League Baseball players named in the Mitchell Report * List of Texas A&M; University people References External links *Chuck Knoblauch historical stats at MLB.com *Criminal Charges, Texas vs. Edward Charles Knoblauch, September 29, 2009, FindLaw Category:1968 births Category:American Christians Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Minnesota Twins players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Kansas City Royals players Category:American League All-Stars Category:Baseball players from Texas Category:Drugs in sport in the United States Category:Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award winners Category:Gold Glove Award winners Category:Texas A&M; Aggies baseball players Category:Kenosha Twins players Category:Visalia Oaks players Category:Orlando Sun Rays players Category:Tampa Yankees players Category:Wichita Wranglers players Category:Sportspeople from Houston Category:Bellaire High School (Bellaire, Texas) alumni Category:Silver Slugger Award winners Category:Wareham Gatemen players ","title":"Chuck Knoblauch"},{"id":"642214","title":"Anne of Brittany"},{"id":"642216","text":"Don Murray may refer to: * Don Murray (clarinetist) (1904‚Äì1929), American jazz musician * Don Murray (actor) (born 1929), American actor * Don Murray (writer) (1923‚Äì2006), writer for the Boston Herald * Don Murray (drummer) (1945‚Äì1996), of the group The Turtles * Don Murray (footballer) (born 1946), former Cardiff City F.C. defender See also * Donald Murray (disambiguation) * Donald Murphy (disambiguation) ","title":"Don Murray"},{"id":"642218","text":"Firangoji Narsala was a Maratha warrior and military leader in the army of Shivaji, in 17th century India. He is famous for his defence of Sangram Durg, a fort, against a Mughal army led by Shaista Khan in 1660 . Firangoji was a 'Killedar' (fortress commander) of this fort in Chakan (Pune). When Shaista Khan invaded Pune with a lakh of soldiers, he selected Sangram Durga as the first target. He attacked the fort with 20,000 soldiers on 23 June 1660. Firangoji Narasala was prepared for this attack, however, even though he had only 320 soldiers. Just before this attack Shivaji had asked his commander to leave the fort. However, Firangoji decided not to abandon the fort and instead started a fierce guerrilla war against the Mughals and defended the fort in this way for 56 days. War ended on 14 August 1660. The Mughals tried another way of taking the fort. They dug a tunnel up to the fort; which was a challenge because of the water around it. They filled this tunnel with explosives and blew up the wall of the fort. This was a major setback for Firangoji and his soldiers; 75 soldiers died in this attack. The Mughal army rushed into the fort; fierce fighting ensued and many Maratha soldiers were killed. Shaista Khan was astonished by Firangoji's bravery, and offered him Mughal Sardari. But Firangoji refused to accept it; instead Shaista Khan gave him and his soldiers safe passage. Firangoji came to meet Shivaji and apologised for surrendering the fort. But Shivaji was very happy with him as he had defended a small fort for almost 2 months. He said \\"if it took 60 days for Shaista Khan to take a small fort, imagine how many days will be required to capture an entire swarajya (kingdom). Shaista Khan will be here for few days, he is not going to take Sangram Durg with him. Whatever you have done is praiseworthy\\".

One species of Hoodia in particular, Hoodia gordonii, has achieved a degree of fame and controversy, after being investigated for use as a possible appetite suppressant. Description Hoodia officinalis Hoodia macrantha The group was first described as a genus in 1844.Decaisne, Joseph. 1844 in Candolle, Augustin Pyramus de (ed), Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis 8: 664 in Latin Hoodia are stem succulents, described as \\"cactiform\\" because of their remarkable similarity to the unrelated cactus family. They have a branching, shrub-like form, and the largest species (Hoodia parviflora) can grow to the size of a tree ‚Äî over in height. The flowers are extremely variable in size ‚Äî from less than 1 cm, to almost 20 cm in diameter, depending on the species. Flowers appear in large numbers, always near the tops of the stems. Those of larger-flowered species (such as Hoodia gordonii) are often a papery pink-tan colour, plate-shaped, with an unpleasant smell to attract their fly pollinators. The smaller, darker flowers of some species have a far stronger and more unpleasant smell than the larger flowers. Distribution The genus Hoodia is restricted to the arid regions in the western part of southern Africa, ranging from western South Africa to central Namibia and as far north as southern Angola. It is especially common in the Namib desert and in the Orange River valley. Typical habitat is rocky slopes and open stone plains. Plants usually germinate in the shelter of bushes or rocks, but survive in the open as adult plants. ;Species Several of the small-flowered species of Hoodia were formerly in a separate genus, Trichocaulon (\\"ghaap\\"), but have been moved into the genus Hoodia, and the two groups are now synonymous. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus Hoodia to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the stapeliad genus Lavrania. Marginally more distantly related is a sister branch of related genera including Larryleachia, Richtersveldia and Notechidnopsis.P. Bruyns, C. Klak, P.

Uses and horticulture Hoodia gordonii Supplement Hoodia gordonii is traditionally used by the San people (Bushmen) of the Namib desert as an appetite suppressant as part of their indigenous knowledge about survival in the harsh desert conditions. In 2006, the plant became internationally known, after a marketing campaign falsely claimed that its use as a dietary supplement was an appetite suppressant for weight loss.Weight Loss Customers Are Being Hoodia-Winked, Harriet Hall, Science-Based Medicine, 11-8-2011, As of 2018, there is no high-quality clinical research showing that hoodia has actions as an appetite suppressant or is effective for weight loss. In a case of biopiracy, bioprospectors from South Africa‚Äôs Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) realized that the plant was marketable and patented its use as an appetite suppressant without recognizing the Sans' traditional claims to the knowledge of the plant and its uses.http://hdl.handle.net/10204/2539Maharaj, VJ, Senabe, JV, and Horak, RM. 2008.

They are characterised by their multicoloured skin, which can present many different patterns, but their noses are always black-tipped. They are a principal form of Sanga cattle, which originated as hybrids of Zebu and humpless cattle in East Africa. DNA analyses have shown that they are a combination of Zebu (Bos indicus) and Bos taurus, the European and some other breeds of local cattle bred from Zebu.Nguni Cattle at Embryoplus They are characterised by low cervicothoracic humps, in front of the front legs, instead of the high thoracic humps of pure Zebu. Besides the various colour patterns, these animals present a variety of horn shapes. All different combinations were catalogued in the beginning of the century by a South African herdmaster.

Clement played for the San Diego Padres (‚Äì), Florida Marlins (), Chicago Cubs (‚Äì) and Boston Red Sox (‚Äì). While on the Red Sox active roster, he was injured all of the 2007 season. He batted and threw right- handed. Clement had a sinking fastball in the low 90s and a hard slider he mixed with a four-seamer and a changeup. In nine seasons, Clement won 87 games and lost 86, and was 1-2 in post-season play, going 1-1 with the Cubs in 2003 and 0-1 with Boston in 2005. His win in Game 4 of the 2003 National League Championship Series at Florida brought the Cubs within one game of the pennant. He held opposing batters to a .233 batting average from 2002‚Äì05, while posting a 47-42 record and a 3.99 ERA. Baseball career In 2000, Clement led the major leagues in walks (125), and led the National League and wild pitches three times between 2000 and 2003. In June 2004, Clement was 6-2 and a candidate to be named to the All-Star Game. But in his next six starts before the break, Clement went 0-4, despite a 2.15 ERA. His run support in those starts was just 1.19 runs per game. He finished with a 3.68 ERA but went 9-13 for the Cubs, who scored only 79 runs in his 30 starts (which is 2.63 runs of support per game, the sixth-lowest mark in the NL). Against American League teams in interleague play, Clement had a 7-7 record with a 3.60 ERA in 19 starts. As a member of the Boston Red Sox in the 2005 season, Clement was named as an All-Star Game selection for the first time in his big league career, replacing injured Blue Jays pitcher Roy Halladay. Clement's record was 10-2 before the All-Star break, and he finished the season at 13-6 with a 4.57 ERA. On July 26, 2005, Clement was struck in the head by a line drive from Carl Crawford of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Clement made just 12 starts in 2006, posting a 5-5 record with a 6.61 ERA, before having season ending shoulder surgery in September. He was rehabilitated at the Red Sox extended spring training complex in Fort Myers, Florida, but did not make a major league appearance in the 2007 season. On January 3, , Clement was signed to a major league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals' team doctor said that Clement was healthy and would be able to begin the season playing regularly. The Cardinals cited his recent rehabilitation and physical as reasons for adding him to the starting rotation for the 2008 season with no expected limitations upon reporting to Jupiter, Florida for spring training. However, Clement would begin the year on the disabled list after making no appearances in Spring training. On June 3, Clement made a minor-league rehab start at Single-A Palm Beach, allowing only 1 hit over six innings. He was released by the Cardinals on August 2. Clement signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays on December 12, 2008 and was invited to Spring training.

Guido Buffarini Guidi (17 August 1895 - 10 July 1945) was an Italian army officer and politician, executed for war crimes in 1945. Buffarini Guidi was born in Pisa in 1895. When Italy entered World War I, he volunteered in an artillery regiment. He was promoted to rank of captain in 1917, and remained on active duty in the Italian Army until 1923 ‚Äì in the meantime, he earned his bachelor's degree in law from the University of Pisa in March 1920. After leaving the army, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, he became active in Fascist circles, and joined the National Fascist Party (PNF). A mayor of Pisa in April 1923, Buffarini Guidi headed the local Party hierarchy from 1924 (his notoriety being increased by his career as a lawyer). He rose to become honorary Consul of the MVSN Blackshirts - the voluntary militia after the March on Rome. In May 1933 he was appointed to be Undersecretary Minister of Interior, and forged an alliance with Galeazzo Ciano - opposing the Party bureaucracy, creating several secret services, and attempting to lessen the effects of Antisemitic legislation passed by the regime. Nevertheless, (and unlike Ciano), on 25 July 1943, Buffarini Guidi voted in favor of Benito Mussolini during Dino Grandi's attempt to have the latter deposed and get Italy to sign a peace with the Allies. As reward, after Nazi Germany intervened and rescued Mussolini in September, Guido Buffarini Guidi was appointed Minister of the Interior of the new Italian Social Republic (established by Nazis in Northern Italy). Seen as extremely avaricious, he was distrusted even by most of his cabinet colleagues. Near the end of the Republic's life, in February 1945, Mussolini dismissed Buffarini Guidi from office. After a failed attempt to escape to Switzerland, he was arrested by the partisans on 26 April. He was sentenced to death by an Extraordinary Court of Justice in Milan who found him guilty of war crimes, and was shot on 10 July, having tried (like French collaborator Pierre Laval) and failed to commit suicide while in captivity. Whilst in prison, Guidi offered to reveal to the Allies compromising letters exchanged between Churchill and Mussolini during the war in exchange for his release. He was unsuccessful but coincidentally, sharing the same cell with Guidi was the industrialist Guido Donegani.  Appearances in film  In the film Massacre in Rome, Guido Guidi is portrayed by the similarly named Italian actor Guidarino Guidi.

He served as a Supreme Court justice from 2003, and became a permanent member in May 2004. Joubran is of Christian Maronite heritage, which makes him eligible for Aramean ethnic status; however, he was frequently described as affiliated with the Arab Christian community. Joubran is sometimes described as the first Arab to receive a permanent appointment in the Israeli Supreme Court. He is also described as the second Arab judge to hold a Supreme Court appointment, preceded by Abdel Rahman Zuabi, who held a fixed nine-month appointment in 1999. Early life Salim Joubran was born in 1947 in the German Colony neighborhood of Haifa, Mandatory Palestine, to a Christian family of Maronite Lebanese origin. He graduated from the Terra Santa School of the Franciscan Order in Acre. He earned a law degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and entered private practice as a lawyer in 1970. Family and personal life Judge Joubran has four children, three of whom are lawyers. His daughter, Rania, was the first Israeli Arab woman to complete a cadet course in the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and served as a diplomat on behalf of Israel until 2009. Legal career In 1982, Joubran left private practice after 12 years to accept an appointment as a judge on Haifa's Magistrate's Court, where he served for 11 years. In 1993, he was appointed to Haifa's district court, and served in that capacity for another 10 years, following which he was elevated to the Supreme Court first as a temporary and then as a permanent judge. Joubran is an expert on criminal law. He was also the first Arab to chair the Central Elections Committee. In the 2013 Israeli municipal elections, he barred the national ruling party Likud's adverts for being \\"racist and almost certain to hurt the feelings of Arab Israelis and disrupt public order\\". This also overruled the advice of Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein, who suggested the committee had no authority to regulate online adverts and posters.  Supreme Court  Salim Joubran was appointed justice in Supreme Court of Israel in 2004. He was appointed deputy to the Supreme Court chief justice on 12 June 2017. He retired later in 2017, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 70. Academic and public positions Joubran was a lecturer at the Law Faculty at the University of Haifa. He served as governor of Israel Rotary (dist. 2490), and chairman of the Zeltner Fund for legal research sponsored by Rotary Israel and Tel Aviv University.

History  The Reginar count Gilbert of the Maasgau, a vassal of the West Frankish king Charles the Bald, had married a daughter of the Carolingian emperor Lothair I in 846; his son Reginar ruled over the Duchy of Lorraine (Lotharingia) from 910 to 915. His son and successor Gilbert swore fealty to the East Frankish king Henry the Fowler in 925 and three years later married his daughter Gerberga of Saxony. His younger brother Reginar attained the title of a Count of Hainaut. About 990 Lambert the Bearded (d. 1015), grandson of Count Reginar II, married Gerberga, daughter of the Carolingian duke Charles of Lower Lorraine, and in 994 was vested with the title of Count of Louvain. Originally limited by the rivers Demer, Dijle and Velp, that is more or less the region known today as Hageland, his county rapidly increased in size and power. Lambert I incorporated the County of Brussels and in 1013 annexed the Duchy of Bruningrode, located around Tongeren. By Lambert's marriage, the Reginar counts claimed the Lorraine ducal title and over the decades acquired great influence in the Holy Roman Empire, acquiring more comital titles over time. His son Lambert II is also mentioned as a count of Brussels, where he had the St. Michael's Church erected to house the relics of Saint Gudula. When he joined the rebellion of Count Baldwin V of Flanders against Emperor Henry III, he was killed in a 1054 battle at Tournai. His grandson, Count Henry III of Louvain was vested with the title of a Landgrave of Brabant upon the death of the Ezzonid count palatine Hermann II of Lotharingia in 1085. He was succeeded by his brother Godfrey I, who retained the landgravial title and 1106 even was raised to a Duke of Lower Lorraine; nevertheless, he had to cede the ducal title to Count Waleran III of Limburg in 1128. In 1139 Godfrey's son Count Godfrey II was again appointed Duke of Lower Lorraine by King Conrad III of Germany and also received the Margraviate of Antwerp. He prevailed against Waleran's son Duke Henry II of Limburg; both noble houses reconciled with the marriage of Count Godfrey III of Louvain and Henry's daughter Margaret. In 1183, he had his son Henry elevated to the rank of Duke of Brabant by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and the County of Louvain was absorbed into the newly created Duchy of Brabant.

They rose to prominence when one of them was appointed Duke of Lower Lorraine. Though Lorraine was later confiscated, the ducal title was kept within the family, transferred to the county of Limburg, and this was eventually ratified by the Holy Roman Emperor. Thereafter, the dukes of Limburg were one of several claimant lines of heirs to the title of the old duke of Lower Lorraine. Their title was eventually inherited by their competitors the dukes of Brabant, and became part of the large collection of titles of the Burgundian Netherlands, eventually passing to the Hapsburgs. After the occupation in 1794 by the French, the old Austrian Duchy of Limburg was disbanded and the largest part was absorbed into the d√©partement of Ourthe (which became the province of Li√®ge). Only a small northern part belonged to the d√©partement of Meuse-Inf√©rieure and thus to the later province of Limburg. The title \\"Duke of Limburg\\" was nevertheless revived after the foundation of the new Duchy of Limburg as a result of the Treaty of London in 1839. According to this treaty the new duchy (without the cities of Maastricht and Venlo), was joined to the German Confederation.

He was the first Polish representative at the League of Nations. His work as a historian was influential in defining the creation and history of the Polish nation.  Biography  Persuaded by his father, Askenazy studied law at the Imperial University of Warsaw in the 1880s. After graduation, he worked as a lawyer; however, all the spare time he devoted to reading books in various languages. In April 1893, he went to G√∂ttingento study history. He was influenced by the professor of medieval and modern history Max Lehmann under whose supervision he wrote doctoral dissertation Die letzte Polnische Koenigswahl (1894). Commencing in 1902, he served as a professor at the University of Lw√≥w till November 1919. In 1909 he was inducted into the Polish Academy of Learning(Polska Akademia Umiejƒôtno≈õci). One of his main books \\"Gda≈Ñsk a Polska\\" was published in 1919 and translated into English (Danzig & Poland, 1921), French (Dantzig et la Pologne, 1919) and German (Danzig und Polen, 1919). Askenazy planned to join Warsaw University, however on his way there stood Bronis≈Çaw Dembi≈Ñski and Marceli Handelsman, who blocked his nomination to become a professor of this university. Famous Poles supported Askenazy: Stefan ≈ªeromski, Zofia Na≈Çkowska, Karol Szymanowski, Leopold Staff, Andrzej Strug, Jaros≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz, Antoni S≈Çonimski, Wac≈Çaw Sieroszewski who signed an appeal (published in Robotnik, 2 March 1920) for a place for Askenazy at Warsaw University, however in vain. After Poland regained independence, Askenazy was chosen to be the first Polish representative at the League of Nations (1920‚Äì23). His candidacy for this post was supported by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudskiand nomination was signed by the Foreign Minister of Poland, Eustachy Sapiehain May 1920. He cooperated later with other Polish Foreign Ministers: Konstanty Skirmunt, Gabriel Narutowiczand Aleksander Skrzy≈Ñski. In May 1923, Marian Seyda from, the Popular National Union (a Polish political party of the National Democracy political camp) became the Foreign Minister of Poland after Lanckorona Pact agreement was introduced. Askenazy saw this as a sign to step down.Jerzy Jan Lerski (1996) Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945, p.19 He resigned from the post and in July 1923 came back to Poland. Askenazy never joined any political party. In his studies, he focused chiefly on Poland's political and economic history in the 18th and 19th centuries. He thus laid the foundations for the Lw√≥w- Warsaw School of History (also known as the \\"Askenazy school\\"). He was the first historian to emphasize the Partitions period as crucially important to the creation of the modern Polish nation. Askenazy's idea of describing a nation's history through its social and economic development, as well as its international and diplomatic backdrop, remains influential in modern Polish historical studies. William J. Rose, an English translator of Askenazy's book \\"Danzig & Poland\\", wrote in the obituary published in The Slavonic and East European Review that with the death of Professor Askenazy \\"Polish learning lost one of its most distinguished ornaments\\".

The city was first mentioned by Assyrian texts as the capital of a Semitic kingdom. It was then ruled by a succession of nearly every polity that controlled Upper Mesopotamia, including the Arameans, Assyrians, Urartu, Armenians, Achaemenid Persians, Medes, Seleucids, and Parthians.Trevor Bryce, The Kingdom of the Hittites, 1999 p. 137 The Roman Republic gained control of the city in 66 BC, by which stage it was named \\"Amida\\".Theodor Mommsen History of Rome, The Establishment of the Military Monarchy. Italian.classic-literature.co.uk. Retrieved 2012-05-13. In 359, Shapur II of Persia captured Amida after a siege of 73 days which is vividly described by the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus.The Eye of Command, Kimberly Kagan, p. 23  Ecclesiastical history  Syriac Christianity took hold in the region between the 1st and 4th centuries AD, particularly amongst the Assyrians of the city. The earliest documented bishop of Amida was Simeon of the Assyrian Church of the East, who took part in the First Council of Nicaea in 325, on behalf of the Assyrians. In the next century, Saint Acacius of Amida (who died in 425, and is included in the Roman MartyrologyMartyrologium Romanum (Vatican Press 2001 ), under 9 April) was noted for having sold the church's gold and silver vessels to ransom and assist Persian prisoners of war. Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II (408‚Äì450) divided the Roman province of Mesopotamia into two, and made Amida the capital of Mesopotamia Prima, and thereby also the metropolitan see for all the province's bishoprics. A sixth-century Notitia Episcopatuum indicates as suffragans of Amida the sees of Martyropolis, Ingila, Belabitene, Arsamosata, Sophene, Kitharis, Cefa, and Zeugma.Echos d'Orient X, 1907, pp. 96 and 145. The Annuario Pontificio adds Bethzabda and Dadima. The names of several of the successors of Acacius are known, but their orthodoxy is unclear. The last whose orthodoxy is certain is Cyriacus, a participant in the Second Council of Constantinople (553). Many bishops of the Byzantine Empire fled in the face of the Persian invasion of the early 7th century, with a resultant spread of the Jacobite Church. Michael the Syrian gives a list of Jacobite bishops of Amida down to the 13th century.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 989‚Äì996http://www.al- monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/04/turkey-pkk-clashes-armenian-church- collateral-damage.html Why the Turkish government seized this Armenian church Inside the St. Giragos Armenian Church photographed after its restoration, 2012. In March 2016, the Turkish government confiscated this and several other churches in Sur, Diyarbakƒ±r after the Siege of Sur (2016). At some stage, Amida became a see of the Armenian Church. The bishops who held the see in 1650 and 1681 were in full communion with the Holy See, and in 1727 Peter Derboghossian sent his profession of faith to Rome. He was succeeded by two more bishops of the Armenian Catholic Church, Eugenius and Ioannes of Smyrna, the latter of whom died in Constantinople in 1785. After a long vacancy, three more bishops followed. The diocese had some 5,000 Armenian Catholics in 1903,Annuaire Pontifical Catholique, 1903, p. 173. but it lost most of its population in the 1915 Armenian Genocide. The last diocesan bishop of the see, Andreas Elias Celebian, was killed with some 600 of his flock in the summer of 1915.Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 456Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Complementi, Leipzig 1931, p. 93F.

Ignatius Philip I Arkus, who was its first bishop, was elected patriarch in 1866, and kept the governance of the see of Amida, which he exercised through a patriarchal vicar. The eparchy was united to that of Mardin in 1888. Persecution of Christians in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War brought an end to the existence of both these Syrian residential sees.S.

As of 2015, there are two Chaldean churches and three Armenian churches in at least periodic operation.

The city passed under Umayyad and then Abbasid control, but with the progressive fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate from the late 9th century, it periodically came under the rule of autonomous dynasties. Isa ibn al-Shaykh al-Shaybani and his descendants ruled the city and the wider Diyar Bakr from 871 until 899, when Caliph al-Mu'tadid restored Abbasid control, but the area soon passed to another local dynasty, the Hamdanids. The latter were displaced by the Buyids in 978, who were in turn followed by the Marwanids in 983. The Marwanids ruled until 1085, the Seljuks took the city from the Marwanids in 1085, the city came under the rule of the Mardin branch of the Oghuz Turks and then the Anatolian beylik of the Artuqids. The city came under the Ayyubid Sultanate in 1183 and ruled the city until it was taken over by the Mongols in 1260, the city was taken over by the competing Turkic federations of the Kara Koyunlu (the Black Sheep) first and then the Aq Qoyunlu until the rise of the Persian Safavids, who naturally took over the city and the wider region. Safavids and Ottomans The Ottomans charged against the Safavids and during Ottoman rule, the government began to assert its authority in the region in the early 19th century. Concerned with independent-mindedness of the Kurdish principalities, the Ottomans sought to curb their influence and bring them under the control of the central government in Constantinople. However, removal from power of these hereditary principalities led to more instability in the region from the 1840s onwards. In their place, sufi sheiks and religious orders rose to prominence and spread their influence throughout the region. One of the prominent Sufi leaders was Shaikh Ubaidalla Nahri, who began a revolt in the region between Lakes Van and Urmia. The area under his control covered both Ottoman and Qajar territories. Shaikh Ubaidalla is regarded as one of the earliest leaders who pursued modern nationalist ideas among Kurds. In a letter to a British Vice-Consul, he declared: the Kurdish nation is a people apart... we want our affairs to be in our hands'.' The breakup of the Ottoman Empire after its defeat in the First World War led to its dismemberment and establishment of the present-day political boundaries, dividing the Kurdish-inhabited regions between several newly created states. This 17th-century map detail shows Diyarbakƒ±r (west at top). From a 17th- century Ottoman map of the Tigris and Euphrates that may have been created by Evliya √áelebi. Between the early 16th century the city and the much wider Eastern Anatolia region (comprising Eastern Anatolia and Southeastern Anatolia) was being heavily competed between the rivaling Safavids from Persia and the Ottomans, who counted on the support of the Kurdish chieftains around Idris Bitlisi. It was firstly conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1514 by the campaigns of Bƒ±yƒ±klƒ± Mehmet Pa≈üa under the rule of Sultan Selim I. Muhammad Han Ustaclu, the Safavid Governor of Diyarbakir, was evicted from the city and killed in the following Battle of Chaldiran in 1514. Following their victory, the Ottomans established the Diyarbekir Eyalet with its centre in Diyarbakƒ±r. The Ottoman eyelet of Diyarbakƒ±r corresponded to Turkey's southeastern provinces today, a rectangular area between the Lake Urmia to Palu and from the southern shores of Lake Van to Cizre and the beginnings of the Syrian desert, although its borders saw some changes over time. The city was an important military base for controlling this region and at the same time a thriving city noted for its craftsmen, producing glass and metalwork. For example, the doors of JalƒÅl ad-Dƒ´n Muhammad R≈´mƒ´'s tomb in Konya were made in Diyarbakƒ±r, as were the gold and silver decorated doors of the tomb of Imam-i Azam Ebu Hanife in Baghdad. Ottoman rule was confirmed by the Peace of Amasya of 1555 which followed after the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1532‚Äì1555). However, a recapture of the city followed by Safavid Persia, ruled by shah Abbas I, during the Ottoman-Safavid War (1603‚Äì1618). Diyarbakƒ±r was retaken by the Safavids once again in 1623‚Äì1624, during the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1623‚Äì1639). In 1895 an estimated 25,000 Armenians and Assyrians were massacred in Diyarbakƒ±r vilayet, including the city. At the turn of the 19th century, the Christian population of the city was mainly made up of Armenians and Syriac Orthodox Christians. The city was also a site of ethnic cleansing of Armenians and Assyrians in 1915; nearly 150,000 were deported from the city. Republic of Turkey A typical example of Diyarbakƒ±r's historic architectural style, with masonry tiles built of the city's indigenous type of dark basalt stone. Diyarbakƒ±r's city walls, built by Constantius II and extended by Valentinian I between 367 and 375, stretch almost unbroken for about 6 kilometres. Ke√ßi Burcu, the Goat Tower, a section of the city wall of Diyarbakir In January 1928, Diyarbakƒ±r became the center of the First Inspectorate-General, a regional subdivision for an area containing the provinces of Hakkari, Van, ≈ûƒ±rnak, Mardin, Siirt, Bitlis and ≈ûanlƒ±urfa. A Inspectorate-General had wide ranging authorities over all civil, military and educational matters. The post of the Inspectorate-General was abandoned in 1948. But its legal framework was only abandoned in 1952 under the government of the Democrat Party. In a reorganization of the provinces, Diyarbakƒ±r city was made the administrative capital of the Diyarbakƒ±r Province. In 1993 Diyarbakir was established as a Metropolitan Municipality. Its districts are Baƒùlar, Bismil, Ergani, Hazro, Kayapinar, √áermik, √áinar, Eƒüil, Dicle, Kulp, Kocak√∂y, Lice, Silvan, Sur, Yeni≈üehir and Hani. During the 1980s and 1990s, at the peak of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) insurgency, the population of the city grew dramatically as villagers from remote areas where fighting was serious left or were forced to leave for the relative security of the city. After the cessation of hostilities between the PKK and the Turkish army, a large degree of normality returned to the city, with the Turkish government declaring an end to the 15-year period of emergency rule on 30 November 2002. Diyarbakƒ±r grew from a population of 30,000 in the 1930s to 65,000 by 1956, to 140,000 by 1970, to 400,000 by 1990, and eventually swelled to about 1.5 million by 1997. The 41-year-old American-Turkish Pirin√ßlik Air Force Base near Diyarbakƒ±r, known as NATO's frontier post for monitoring the former Soviet Union and the Middle East, closed on 30 September 1997. This closure was the result of the general drawdown of US bases in Europe and the improvement in space surveillance technology. The base housed sensitive electronic intelligence-gathering systems that monitored the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Russia. Diyarbakƒ±r has been the victim of terror attacks in recent years. In 2008, a car bomb exploded in the city, killing five people, a blast for which nobody claimed responsibility. In 2015, a political rally of the People's Democratic Party was targeted, killing three people and injuring over 100. And in 2016, two separate attacks in February and March, each killing six people. In November 2016 ISIL perpetrated an attack that killed 9 people and wounded more than 100. In January 2017 another attack was perpetrated against the police, in which 4 police officers died. Between 8 November 2015 and 15 May 2016 large parts of Sur were destroyed in fighting between the Turkish military and the PKK. A 2018 report by Arkeologlar Derneƒüi ƒ∞stanbul found that, since 2015, 72% of the city's historic Sur district had been destroyed through demolition and redevelopment, and that laws designed to protect historic monuments had been ignored. They found that the city's \\"urban regeneration\\" policy was one of demolition and redevelopment rather than one of repairing cultural assets damaged during the recent civil conflict, and because of that many registered historic buildings had been completely destroyed. The extent of the loss of non-registered historic structures is unknown because any historic building fragments revealed during the demolition of modern structures were also demolished.Diyarbakir Ziyareti: √áati≈üma, Yikim ve Yeniden ƒ∞n≈üa  Sports  The most notable football clubs of the city are Diyarbakƒ±rspor (established 1968) and Amed SK (established 1990). The women's football team Amed SFK were promoted at the end of the 2016‚Äì17 Turkish Women's Second Football League season to the Women's First League. Politics In the 2014 local elections, G√ºltan Kƒ±≈üanak and Fƒ±rat Anlƒ± of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) were elected co-mayors of Diyarbakƒ±r. However, on 25 October 2016, both were detained by Turkish authorities \\"on thinly supported charges of being a member of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)\\". The Turkish government ordered a general internet blackout after the arrest. Nevertheless, on 26 October, several thousand demonstrators at Diyarbakir city hall demanded the mayors' release. Some days later, the Turkish government appointed an unelected state trustee as the mayor. In November, public prosecutors demanded a 230-year prison sentence for Kƒ±≈üanak. In January 2017, the Turkish government appointed unelected state trustee ordered the removal of the Assyrian sculpture of a mythological winged bull from the townhall, which had been erected by the BDP mayors to commemorate the Assyrian history of the town and its still resident Assyrian minority. In the Municipal election 2019 Adnan Sel√ßuk Mƒ±zraklƒ± was elected mayor of Diyarbakir In August 2019 he was dismissed accused of supporting terrorism. Economy Historically, Diyarbakƒ±r produced wheat and sesame. They would preserve the wheat in warehouses, with coverings of straw and twigs from licorice trees. This system would allow the wheat to be preserved for up to ten years. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Diyarbakƒ±r exported raisins, almonds, and apricots to Europe. Angora goats were raised, and wool and mohair was exported from Diyarbakƒ±r. Merchants would also come from Egypt, Istanbul, and Syria, to purchase goats and sheep. Honey was also produced, but not so much exported, but used by locals. Sericulture was observed in the area, too. Prior to World War I, Diyarbakƒ±r had an active copper industry, with six mines. Three were active, with two being owned by locals and the third being owned by the Turkish government. Tenorite was the primary type of copper mined. It was mined by hand by Kurds. A large portion of the ore was exported to England. The region also produced iron, gypsum, coal, chalk, lime, jet, and quartz, but primarily for local use. Demographics Demographic history At the turn of the 19th century, the Christian population of the city was mainly made up of Armenians and Assyrians. The Assyrian and Armenian presence dates to antiquity. There was also a small Jewish community in the city. Konu: Diyarbakƒ±r Tarihi ve Demografik Yapƒ±sƒ± =Present day= According to a November 2006 survey by the S√ªr Municipality, 72% of the inhabitants of the municipality use Kurdish most often in their daily speech due to the overwhelming Kurdish majority in the city with small minorities of Assyrians, Armenians, Turks and Yazidis still resident. After World War II, as the Kurdish population moved to urban centres, Diyarbakir's Kurdish population continued to grow. There are also several Alevi Turkmen villages around Diyarbakƒ±r old city, however there are no specific official data about the population numbers. Diyarbakƒ±r Alevi- T√ºrkmen k√∂yleri Culture Some jewelry making and other craftwork continues today although the fame of the Diyarbakƒ±r's craftsmen has long passed. Folk dancing to the drum and zurna (pipe) are a part of weddings and celebrations in the area. Cuisine Diyarbakƒ±r is known for rich dishes of lamb which use spices such as black pepper, sumac and coriander; rice, bulgur and butter. The most famous specialty dish from Diyarbakƒ±r is Meftune which is made up of lamb meat and vegetable laced with garlic and sumac. Another known dish is Kaburga Dolmasƒ± which is a baked lamb's ribs stuffed with rice, almonds and many spices. Diyarbakƒ±r is also known for its watermelons; one of the events in the city is the annually held Watermelon Festival. Main sights Sheikh Matar Mosque with its Four-legged Minaret The core of Diyarbakƒ±r is surrounded by an almost intact, dramatic set of high walls of black basalt forming a circle around the old city. There are four gates into the old city and 82 watch-towers on the walls, which were built in antiquity, restored and extended by the Roman emperor Constantius II in 349. The area inside the walls is known as the Sur district; before its recent demolition and redevelopment this district had 599 registered historical buildings.  Medieval mosques and medreses  * Great Mosque of Diyarbakƒ±r built by the Seljuk Turkish Sultan Malik Shah in the 11th century. The mosque, one of the oldest in Turkey, is constructed in alternating bands of black basalt and white limestone (The same patterning is used in the 16th century Deliler Han Madrassah, which is now a hotel).

Climate Diyarbakƒ±r has a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa). Summers are very hot and very dry, due to its location on the Mesopotamian plain which is subject to hot winds from the deserts of Syria and Iraq to the south. The highest recorded temperature was 46.2 ¬∞C (112.64 ¬∞F) on 21 July 1937. Winters are cold with moderate precipitation and frosty nights. Snowfall is quite common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two. The lowest recorded temperature was ‚àí24.2 ¬∞C (‚àí10.12 ¬∞F) on 11 January 1933. Highest recorded snow depth was 65 cm (25.6 inches) on 16 January 1971.

In the 19th century, most history studies in Poland were focused mainly on the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The dominant trend among most conservative historians was to argue that the modern history of Poland was nothing but a history of ill-fated uprisings; the history was thus ignored in their studies. The Askenazy school was the first to underline the importance of recent history in the creation of the modern nation in Poland. It also focused on the history of international diplomatic relations and economic development of Poland.

Trucks carry the necessary hoses and pumping equipment, but no fuel. Aviation fuels are petroleum-based fuels, or petroleum and synthetic fuel blends, used to power aircraft. They have more stringent requirements than fuels used for ground use, such as heating and road transport, and contain additives to enhance or maintain properties important to fuel performance or handling. They are kerosene-based (JP-8 and Jet A-1) for gas turbine-powered aircraft. Piston-engined aircraft use gasoline and those with diesel engines may use jet fuel (kerosene).https://www.skybrary.aero/bookshelf/books/2478.pdf By 2012 all aircraft operated by the U.S. Air Force had been certified to use a 50-50 blend of kerosene and synthetic fuel derived from coal or natural gas as a way of stabilizing the cost of fuel.https://www.airforcemag.com/article/0712fuel/ Specific energy is an important criterion in selecting fuel for an aircraft. The much higher energy storage capability of hydrocarbon fuels compared to batteries has so far prevented electric aircraft using electric batteries as the main propulsion energy store becoming viable for even small personal aircraft. Types of aviation fuel  Conventional aviation fuels = Jet fuel = Ground fueling of a MIG-29 from a URAL tanker (2011). Jet fuel is a clear to straw-colored fuel, based on either an unleaded kerosene (Jet A-1), or a naphtha-kerosene blend (Jet B). Similar to diesel fuel, it can be used in either compression ignition engines or turbine engines. Jet-A powers modern commercial airliners and is a mix of extremely refined kerosene and burns at temperatures at or above . Kerosene-based fuel has a much higher flash point than gasoline-based fuel, meaning that it requires significantly higher temperature to ignite. It is a high-quality fuel; if it fails the purity and other quality tests for use on jet aircraft, it is sold to ground- based users with less demanding requirements, such as railroads. = Avgas = Avgas (aviation gasoline) is used by small aircraft, light helicopters and vintage piston-engined aircraft. Its formulation is distinct from the conventional gasoline (petrol U.K.) used in motor vehicles which is commonly called mogas or autogas in aviation context.The development of Piston Aero Engines, Bill Gunston 1999, Patrick Stephens Limited, , p.36 Although it comes in many different grades, its 100 octane rating is higher than that for \\"regular\\" motor gasoline which varies between 91 in the United States and 95 in Europe.  Emerging aviation fuels  = Biofuels = Alternatives to conventional fossil-based aviation fuels, new fuels made via the biomass to liquid method (like sustainable aviation fuel) and certain straight vegetable oils can also be used. Fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel have the advantage that few or no modifications are necessary on the aircraft itself, provided that the fuel characteristics meet specifications for lubricity and density as well as adequately swelling elastomer seals in current aircraft fuel systems. Sustainable aviation fuel and blends of fossil and sustainably- sourced alternative fuels yield lower emissions of particles and GHGs. They are, however, not being used heavily, because they still face political, technological, and economic barriers, such as currently being more expensive than conventionally produced aviation fuels by a wide margin.IATA 2014 Report on Alternative Fuels = Compressed natural gas and liquified natural gas = Compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG) are fuel feedstocks that aircraft may use in the future. Studies have been done on the feasibility of using natural gas and include the \\"SUGAR Freeze\\" aircraft under NASA's N+4 Advanced Concept Development program (made by Boeing's Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research (SUGAR) team). The Tupolev Tu-155 was an alternative fuel testbed which was fuelled on LNG. The low specific energy of natural gas even in liquid form compared to conventional fuels gives it a distinct disadvantage for flight applications. Production of aviation fuel The production of aviation fuel falls into two categories: fuel suitable for turbine engines and fuel suitable for spark-ignition piston engines. There are international specifications for each. Jet fuel is a gas turbine fuel used in propeller and jet aircraft and helicopters. It has a low viscosity at low temperature, has limited ranges of density and calorific value, burns cleanly, and remains chemically stable when heated to high temperature. Aviation gasoline, often referred to as \\"avgas\\" or 100-LL (low-lead), is a highly refined form of gasoline for aircraft, with an emphasis on purity, anti-knock characteristics and minimization of spark plug fouling. Avgas must meet performance guidelines for both the rich mixture condition required for take- off power settings and the leaner mixtures used during cruise to reduce fuel consumption. Aviation fuel can be used as CNG fuel. Avgas is sold in much lower volume than jet fuel, but to many more individual aircraft operators; whereas jet fuel is sold in high volume to large aircraft operators, such as airlines and military. Energy content The net energy content for aviation fuels depends on their composition. Some typical values are:Air BP. BP Products handbook . Retrieved 2008-09-13 *BP Avgas 80, 44.65 MJ/kg, density at 15 ¬∞C is 690 kg/m3 ( MJ/litre). *Kerosene type BP Jet A-1, 43.15 MJ/kg, density at 15 ¬∞C is 804 kg/m3 ( MJ/litre). *Kerosene type BP Jet TS-1 (for lower temperatures), 43.2 MJ/kg, density at 15 ¬∞C is 787 kg/m3 ( MJ/litre). Density In performance calculations, airliner manufacturers use a density of jet fuel around lb/USgal or kg/l. Specific cases are: * Bombardier Aerospace: The Challenger Multi-role Aircraft is a special mission variant of the Bombardier Challenger 650 business jet platform. Bombardier bases performance on the use of fuel with an average lower heating value of 18,550 BTU/lb (43.147 MJ/kg) and a density of . * Embraer: In its airport planning manual for the E195 uses an adopted fuel density of .  Chemical composition  Aviation fuels consist of blends of over two thousand chemicals, primarily hydrocarbons (paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, and aromatics), additives such as antioxidants and metal deactivators, biocides, static reducers, icing inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, and impurities. Principal components include n-heptane and isooctane. Like other fuels, aviation fuel for spark-ignited piston engines are described by their octane rating. Alcohol, alcohol mixtures, and other alternative fuels may be used experimentally, but alcohol is not permitted in any certified aviation fuel specification. In Brazil, the Embraer Ipanema EMB-202A is a version of the Ipanema agricultural aircraft with a modified Lycoming IO-540-K1J5 engine so as to be able to run on ethanol. Other aircraft engines that were modified to run on 100% ethanol were several other types of Lycoming engines (including the Lycoming 235N2C, and Lycoming IO-320) and certain Rotax engines.Rotax engines on ethanol/conventional fuel blend Tax The Convention on International Civil Aviation (ICAO) (Chicago 1944, Article 24) exempts air fuels already loaded onto an aircraft on landing (and which remain on the aircraft) from import taxes. Bi-lateral air services agreements govern the tax exemption of aviation fuels. In the course of an EU initiative, many of these agreements have been modified to allow taxation. Also, the motion for a European parliament resolution on a European Strategy for Low-emission Mobility has stated that \\"the possibilities for harmonised international measures for kerosene taxation for aviation\\" needs to be explored. Australia and the United States oppose a worldwide levy on aviation fuel, but a number of other countries have expressed interest. During a debate in the UK Parliament, the forgone tax income due to the exemption of tax on aviation fuel was estimated at ¬£10 billion annually. Furthermore, the planned inclusion of international aviation into the European Union Emission Trading Scheme in 2014 has been called an 'illegal tax' by countries including the US and China, which cite the Chicago Convention.  Certification  Fuels have to conform to a specification in order to be approved for use in type certificated aircraft. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) developed specifications for automobile gasoline as well as aviation gasoline. These specifications are ASTM D910 and ASTM D6227 for aviation gasoline and ASTM D439 or ASTM D4814 (latest revision) for automobile gasoline.  In use  Aviation fuel storage tanks at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston, Texas Aviation fuel generally arrives at the airport via pipeline systems, such as the CEPS. It is then pumped over and dispensed from a tanker or bowser. The fuel is then driven up to parked aircraft and helicopters. Some airports have pumps similar to filling stations to which aircraft must taxi. Some airports have permanent piping to parking areas for large aircraft. Aviation fuel is transferred to an aircraft via one of two methods: overwing or underwing. Overwing HK36-TTC Super Dimona Overwing fueling is used on smaller planes, helicopters, and all piston-engine aircraft. Overwing fueling is similar to car fueling -- one or more fuel ports are opened and fuel is pumped in with a conventional pump. Underwing Most widebody aircraft use a double single-point Underwing fueling, also called single-point refueling or pressure refueling where not dependent on gravity, is used on larger aircraft and for jet fuel exclusively. For pressure refueling, a high-pressure hose is attached and fuel is pumped in at 275 kPa (40 psi) and a maximum of 310 kPa (45 psi) for most commercial aircraft. Pressure for military aircraft, especially fighters, ranges up to 415 kPa (60 psi). Air being displaced in the tanks is usually vented overboard through a single vent on the aircraft. Because there is only one attachment point, fuel distribution between tanks is either automated or it is controlled from a control panel at the fueling point or in the cockpit. An early use of pressure refueling was on the de Havilland Comet and Sud Aviation Caravelle. Larger aircraft allow for two or more attachment points; however, this is still referred to as single-point refueling, as either attachment point can refuel all of the tanks. Multiple attachments allow for faster fuel flows. Misfueling Because of the danger of confusing the fuel types, precautions are taken to distinguish between avgas and jet fuel beyond clearly marking all containers, vehicles, and piping. The aperture on fuel tanks of aircraft requiring avgas cannot be greater than 60 millimetres in diameter. Avgas is often dyed and is dispensed from nozzles with a diameter of 40 mm (49 mm in the United States). Jet fuel is clear to straw-colored, and is dispensed from a special nozzle called a J spout or duckbill that has a rectangular opening larger than 60 mm diagonally, so as not to fit into avgas ports. However, some jet and turbine aircraft, such as some models of the Astar helicopter, have a fueling port too small for the J spout, and thus require a smaller nozzle.  Safety precautions  British Airways Airbus A321 being refueled Any fueling operation can be very dangerous, and aviation operations have characteristics which must be accommodated. As an aircraft flies through the air, it can accumulate static electricity. If this is not dissipated before fueling, an electric arc could occur and ignite fuel vapors. To prevent this, aircraft are electrically bonded to the fueling apparatus before fueling begins, and are not disconnected until after fueling is complete. Some regions require the aircraft and/or fuel truck to be grounded too. Pressure fueling systems incorporate a dead man's switch to preclude unmonitored operation. Aviation fuel can cause severe environmental damage; all fueling vehicles must carry equipment to control fuel spills. Fire extinguishers must be present at any fueling operation. Airport firefighting forces are specially trained and equipped to handle aviation fuel fires and spills. Aviation fuel must be checked daily and before every flight for contaminants such as water or dirt. Avgas is the only remaining lead-containing transportation fuel. Lead in avgas prevents damaging engine knock, or detonation, that can result in a sudden engine failure. Lead is a toxic substance that can be inhaled or absorbed in the bloodstream, and the FAA and EPA and industry are partnering to remove it from avgas. Many airlines now require safety belts be left unfastened should passengers be aboard during refueling.

He was a personal secretary to two Kings of Poland, Sigismund I the Old and Sigismund II Augustus. Biography Kromer was born in 1512 into a prominent burgher family of German descent in Biecz, in Lesser Poland. He completed his basic education in a local church-run school. In 1528 he transferred to Krak√≥w, where in 1530 he graduated as a bachelor at the Cracow Academy. In 1533‚Äì37 he worked at the Royal Chancellery in Krak√≥w. Thereafter he went to Italy, where he studied law for two years. Returning to Poland in 1540, he became secretary to Archbishop Piotr Gamrat. As the latter's personal advisor, he was also his envoy and representative to Rome, where he spent two years until 1544. He then became a canon in Krak√≥w. In 1545, upon the death of his mentor, Kromer accepted the latter's post as personal secretary to Poland's King Sigismund I the Old. He was also an associate of Samuel Maciejowski, who later became Chancellor of the Crown. A specialist on Royal Prussia and Warmia, in 1551 Kromer became head of the Warmian canonry. However, his church career did not proceed as planned, since he was seen as one of the best Polish diplomats of the age and was frequently required by the court to leave his post to serve as envoy on various diplomatic missions. In 1552, for his services to the King, he was ennobled and granted a coat of arms. From 1558 to 1564 Kromer served as Polish envoy to Emperor Ferdinand I, who in recognition of Kromer's services added his own family coat-of-arms to Kromer's. The latter's tasks included advocacy of King Sigismund's claims to the inheritance of the late Queen-Consort Bona Sforza, which was also claimed by the King of Spain, who, however, based his claims on a forged testament. In 1564 Kromer was recalled to Poland, where he was promoted within the church hierarchy and took the post of coadjutor (de facto bishop) of the Bishopric of Warmia, to succeed on the demise of Prince-Bishop Stanislaus Hosius. After nine years at that post, Kromer was officially promoted to Prince-Bishop. He spent the rest of his days in Warmia, keeping diaries and writing several books on the history of Poland. He died on 23 March 1589 in Heilsberg (Lidzbark Warmi≈Ñski). In his works, Kromer advocated the reform of Poland's scientific and cultural life. One of his notable demands was providing the Cracow Academy with new privileges to restore its position as one of the renowned universities in Central Europe. He also promoted the active defence of the Roman Catholic Church against the growing Reformation. Martin Kromer and Stanislaus Hosius (Stanis≈Çaw Hozjusz) were the two bishops most instrumental in causing Royal Prussia's diocese of Warmia to return to or remain Catholic during a time of major conversions to Protestantism, especially in the neighboring Duchy of Prussia which almost surrounded the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, and had converted to Lutheranism as the first state to do so.

It is on the District line between to the west and to the east. It is along the line from the eastern terminus at and to in central London where the line divides into numerous branches. It is in Travelcard Zone 5. The station was originally opened as Gale Street Halt in 1926 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on the existing route from in London toward Southend. The station was renamed and completely rebuilt in 1932 with an additional pair of platforms to serve the electric District Railway (now the District line) local service. Main-line services ceased to call at the station in the 1960s, leaving only two platforms in operation. Geography The station is located on the west side of Gale Street. It serves the residential area of Becontree, which is to the north of the station. There is a commercial area to the south of the station, while Parsloes Park is to the north. Nearby landmarks include a driving school, the Jo Richardson Community School, Roding Primary School and The James Campbell Primary School. The railway here was crossed by Becontree Estate Railway, a temporary railway constructed as part of the building of the Becontree housing estate which operated between 1921 and 1934. Becontree estate was constructed in the 1920s by C. J. Wills and Sons Ltd., with the remainder completed in 1938. The estate was once to be served by high speed tramways, with services starting from Ilford, branching out into the estate and then rejoining the current line to Barking. This was not supported by Ilford and Barking councils, and was abandoned due to problems with Ilford authorities and the need to electrify the Barking to Upminster line. There was also a deferred plan for a Kearney Monorail tube connecting Becontree to the city. History Becontree in 1961, with the former LT&SR; tracks and platforms in the foreground. In 1858 a line through East Ham was constructed to provide a faster connection between Barking and the city of London, which connects to the London and Blackwall Railway route to Fenchurch Street. Between 1885 and 1888, the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&SR;) constructed a line between Barking and Pitsea via Upminster to provide a more direct route between the two cities. The station was not built at the time. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMSR) took ownership of the LT&SR; in 1923 and the station opened as Gale Street Halt on 28 June 1926 to serve the new Becontree Estate and subsequent residential areas. Initially, there were no roads leading to the station. In 1929, the company proposed quadrupling their line between Barking and Upminster and electrifying one pair of tracks for the District line. The station was rebuilt and new platforms were constructed for the new pair of tracks. Gale Street Halt was renamed as Becontree and the new station building to the designs of the architect William Henry Hamlyn opened on 18 July 1932, with electrified District line services starting operation 2 months after on 12 September. In addition to the start of electrified services, two new adjacent stations on the District line named Upney and Heathway (now Dagenham Heathway) opened. By 1935, there were approximately 18,000 homes in this area, and together with developers, Dagenham Council added more than 5000 homes until 1965. By 1940, the population grew to 116,000. This particular section of the line between Barking and Upminster was popular among commuters getting to West and East Ham which reduced the need for bus services. Other reasons were a shortened travel time to Charing Cross of up to 35 minutes and the good availability of trains servicing this part of the line. The slow tracks on the former LT&SR; line to Upminster were shared with steam locomotive hauled goods and passenger services, until 1961 when the District line took over exclusive use of the DC electrified lines. LT&SR; services ceased to stop at the station on 15 June 1962. The station today Westbound platform looking east, with the fenced off LT&SR; platform visible to the right. The station has four platforms, of which two are used by the District line and another two are disused since the LT&SR; service was withdrawn in 1962. One of the platforms is fenced off from the westbound District line platform. The single-storey brick station buildings are of typical 1930s design which are also constructed at Dagenham East, Hornchurch and Upminster at the time. Station refurbishment works were completed by Metronet in 2006, where heritage features were restored, CCTV equipment replaced and PA system enhanced. New wall tiles and ceilings were clad, and new tactile strips, customer Help Points and better lighting were installed. Whilst these works were done between 2005 and 2006, the station was closed on several weekends whereby replacement buses operated to Dagenham Heathway station. Services and connections Becontree is on the Upminster part of the line between Upney and Dagenham Heathway.

McKinsey, that advises on strategic management to corporations, governments, and other organizations. Under the leadership of Marvin Bower, McKinsey expanded into Europe during the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s, McKinsey's Fred Gluck‚Äîalong with Boston Consulting Group's Bruce Henderson, Bill Bain at Bain & Company, and Harvard Business School's Michael Porter‚Äîtransformed corporate culture. A 1975 publication by McKinsey's John L. Neuman introduced a scheme of \\"overhead value analysis\\" that contributed to a downsizing trend that eliminated many jobs in middle management. McKinsey publishes a business magazine, the McKinsey Quarterly, and its consultants have authored many influential books. Its alumni have held high-level corporate and political positions. The firm has been associated with a number of notable scandals including the collapse of Enron in 2001 and the 2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis. It has also drawn controversy for involvement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and authoritarian regimes. History Early history James O. McKinsey (1889‚Äì1937) founder of the company McKinsey & Company was founded in Chicago under the name James O. McKinsey & Company in 1926 by James O. McKinsey, a professor of accounting at the University of Chicago. He conceived the idea after witnessing inefficiencies in military suppliers while working for the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. The firm called itself an \\"accounting and management firm\\" and started out giving advice on using accounting principles as a management tool. McKinsey's first partners were Tom Kearney, hired in 1929, and Marvin Bower, hired in 1933. Marvin Bower, founder of modern-day McKinsey and its corporate culture Marvin Bower is credited with establishing McKinsey's values and principles in 1937, based on his experience as a lawyer. The firm developed an \\"up or out\\" policy, where consultants who are not promoted are asked to leave. in 1937. Bower established a set of rules: that consultants should put the interests of clients before McKinsey's revenues, not discuss client affairs, tell the truth even if it means challenging the client's opinion, and only perform work that is both necessary and that McKinsey can do well. Bower created the firm's principle of only working with CEOs, which was later expanded to CEOs of subsidiaries and divisions. He also created McKinsey's principle of only working with clients the firm felt would follow its advice. Bower also established the firm's language. In 1932, the company opened its second office in New York City. In 1935, McKinsey left the firm temporarily to serve as the Chairman and CEO of client Marshall Field's. Also in 1935, McKinsey merged with accounting firm Scovell, Wellington & Company, creating the New York-based McKinsey, Wellington & Co. and splitting off the accounting practice into Chicago-based Wellington & Company. A Wellington project that accounted for 55 percent of McKinsey, Wellington & Company's billings was about to expire and Kearney and Bower had disagreements about how to run the firm. Bower wanted to expand nationally and hire young business school graduates, whereas Kearney wanted to stay in Chicago and hire experienced accountants. In 1937, James O. McKinsey died after catching pneumonia. This led to the division of McKinsey, Wellington & Company in 1939. The accounting practice returned to Scovell, Wellington & Company, while the management engineering practice was split into McKinsey & Company and McKinsey, Kearney & Company. Bower had partnered with Guy Crockett from Scovell Wellington, who invested in the new McKinsey & Company and became managing partner, while Marvin Bower is credited with founding the firm's principles and strategy as his deputy. The New York office purchased exclusive rights to the McKinsey name in 1946. Years of growth McKinsey & Company grew quickly in the 1940s and 50s, especially in Europe. It had 88 staff in 1951 and more than 200 by the 1960s, including 37 in London by 1966. In the same year, McKinsey had six offices in major US cities like San Francisco, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., as well as six abroad. These foreign offices were primarily in Europe, such as in London, Paris, Amsterdam, as well as in Melbourne. By this time, one third of the company's revenues originated from its European offices. Guy Crockett stepped down as managing director in 1950, and Marvin Bower was elected in his place. McKinsey's profit-sharing, executive and planning committees were formed in 1951. The organization's client base expanded especially among governments, defense contractors, bluechip companies and military organizations in the post-World War II era. After seven years of consideration, McKinsey became a private corporation with shares owned exclusively by McKinsey employees in 1956. After Bower stepped down in 1967, the firm's revenues declined. New competitors like the Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Company created increased competition for McKinsey by marketing specific branded products, such as the Growth-Share Matrix, and by selling their industry expertise. In 1971, McKinsey created the Commission on Firm Aims and Goals, which found that McKinsey had become too focused on geographic expansion and lacked adequate industry knowledge. The commission advised that McKinsey slow its growth and develop industry specialties. In 1975, John L. Neuman, then a McKinsey consultant, published \\"Make Overhead Cuts That Last\\" in Harvard Business Review, in which he introduced new rules for scientific management such as \\"overhead valuation analysis\\" (OVA) (extra ) OVA guided McKinsey's \\"path to downsizing\\", responding to the \\"mid-century corporation's excessive reliance on middle management\\". Neuman wrote that the \\"process, though swift, is not painless. Since overhead expenses are typically 70% to 85% people-related and most savings come from work-force reductions, cutting overhead does demand some wrenching decisions.\\" In 1976, Ron Daniel was elected managing director, serving until 1988. Daniel and Fred Gluck helped shift the firm away from its generalist approach by developing 15 specialized working groups within McKinsey called Centers of Competence and by developing practice areas called Strategy, Operations and Organization. Daniel also began McKinsey's knowledge management efforts in 1987. This led to the creation of an IT system that tracked McKinsey engagements, a process to centralize knowledge from each practice area and a resource directory of internal experts.\\" By the end of his tenure in 1988 the firm was growing again and had opened new offices in Rome, Helsinki, S√£o Paulo and Minneapolis. Fred Gluck served as McKinsey's managing director from 1988 to 1994. The firm's revenues doubled during his tenure. He organized McKinsey into 72 \\"islands of activity\\" that were organized under seven sectors and seven functional areas. By 1997, McKinsey had grown eightfold over its size in 1977. In 1989 the firm tried to acquire talent in IT services through a $10 million purchase of the Information Consulting Group (ICG), but a culture clash caused 151 out of the 254 ICG staff members to leave by 1993. In 1994, Rajat Gupta became the first non-American-born partner to be elected as the firm's managing director. By the end of his tenure, McKinsey had grown from 2,900 to 7,700 staff and 58 to 84 locations. He opened new international offices in cities such as Moscow, Beijing and Bangkok. Continuing the structure developed by prior directors, Gupta also created 16 industry groups charged with understanding specific markets and instituted a three-term limit for the managing director. McKinsey created practice areas for manufacturing and business technology in the late 1990s. McKinsey set up \\"accelerators\\" in the 1990s, where the firm accepted stock-based reimbursement to help internet startups; the company performed more than 1,000 e-commerce projects from 1998-2000 alone. An October 1, 2000 article in the New York Times described the compulsory mini-courses that McKinsey‚Äîand its two largest rivals Boston Consulting and Bain‚Äîoffered their \\"hyper-educated\\" young new recruits. Once completed, these newly certified management consultants would begin their work of \\"advising the executives of multibillion-dollar companies\\" on \\"projects\\" not related to their academic backgrounds\\"‚Äî\\"[l]awyers would help packaged-foods companies develop new products, and physicists would tell Internet start-ups how to stand out from the crowd.\\" The burst of the dot-com bubble led to a reduction in utilization rates of McKinsey's consultants from 64 to 52 percent. Though McKinsey avoided dismissing any personnel following the decline, the decline in revenues and losses from equity-based payments as stock lost value, together with a recession in 2001, meant the company had to reduce its prices, cut expenses and reduce hiring. In 2001, McKinsey launched several practices that focused on the public and social sector. It took on many public sector or non profit clients on a pro bono basis. By 2002 McKinsey had invested a $35.8 million budget on knowledge management, up from $8.3 million in 1999. Its revenues were 50, 20, and 30 percent from strategy, operations, and technology consulting, respectively. In 2003 Ian Davis, the head of the London, UK office, was elected to the position of managing director. Davis promised a return to the company's core values, after a period in which the firm had expanded rapidly, which some McKinsey consultants felt was a departure from the company's heritage. Also in 2003, the firm established a headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region in Shanghai, China. By 2004, more than 60 percent of McKinsey's revenues were generated outside the U.S. The company started a Social Sector Office (SSO) in 2008, which is divided into three practices: Global Public Health, Economic Development and Opportunity Creation (EDHOC) and Philanthropy. McKinsey does much of its pro- bono work through the SSO, whereas a Business Technology Office (BTO), founded in 1997, provides consulting on technology strategy. By 2009, the firm consisted of 400 directors (senior partners), up from 151 in 1993. Dominic Barton was elected as Managing Director, a role he was re-elected for in 2012 and 2015. Recent history Rajat Gupta and another McKinsey executive, Anil Kumar, were among those convicted in a government investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with Galleon Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam. Though McKinsey was not accused of any wrongdoing, the convictions were embarrassing for the firm, since it prides itself on integrity and client confidentiality. McKinsey no longer maintains a relationship with either senior partner. Senior partner Anil Kumar, described as Gupta's prot√©g√©, left the firm after the allegations in 2009 and pleaded guilty in January 2010. While he and other partners had been pitching McKinsey's consulting services to the Galleon Group, Kumar and Rajaratnam reached a private consulting agreement, violating McKinsey's policies on confidentiality. Gupta was convicted in June 2012 of four counts of conspiracy and securities fraud, and acquitted on two counts. In October 2011, he was arrested by the FBI on criminal charges of sharing insider information from these confidential board meetings with Rajaratnam. At least twice, Gupta used a McKinsey phone to call Rajaratnam and retained other perks ‚Äî an office, assistant, and $6 million retirement salary that year ‚Äî as a senior partner emeritus. After the scandal McKinsey instituted new policies and procedures to discourage future indiscretions from consultants, including investigating other partners' ties to Gupta. In February 2018, Kevin Sneader was elected as Managing Director. He is serving a three-year term that began on July 1, 2018. McKinsey has consulted for multiple cities, states and government organizations during the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. During the first four months of the pandemic, McKinsey obtained in excess of $100 million in consulting work, including no-bid contracts with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and Air Force. The reopening guidelines for Florida's Miami-Dade County, produced with McKinsey's input, were criticized by local media and officials for complexity and lack of clarity. Organization and services Structure McKinsey office in Bucharest, Romania McKinsey & Company was originally organized as a partnership before being legally restructured as a private corporation with shares owned by its partners in 1956. It mimics the structure of a partnership and employees are called \\"partners\\". The company has a flat hierarchy and each member is assigned a mentor. Since the 1960s, McKinsey's Managing Director has been elected by a vote of senior directors to serve up to three, three-year terms or until reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60. The firm is also managed by a series of committees that each has its own area of responsibility. By 2013, McKinsey was described as having a de-centralized structure, whereby different offices operate similarly, but independently. Each office is expected to put the overall organization's best interest before the office's, which McKinsey refers to as the \\"one firm\\" principle. Consultants and engagements are often shared across offices. Revenues from all offices are pooled and an individual office's revenue does not directly affect it financially. The company's budgeting is centralized, but individual consultants are given a large degree of autonomy. Consulting services McKinsey & Company provides strategy and management consulting services, such as providing advice on an acquisition, developing a plan to restructure a sales force, creating a new business strategy or providing advice on downsizing, according to the 2013 book, The Firm. The 1999 book, The McKinsey Way said that McKinsey consultants designed and implemented studies to evaluate management decisions using data and interviews to test hypotheses. which were then presented to senior management, typically in a PowerPoint presentation and a booklet. McKinsey & Company has traditionally charged approximately 25 percent more than competing firms. A typical McKinsey engagement can last between two and twelve months and involves three to six McKinsey consultants. An engagement is usually managed by a generalist that covers the region the client's headquarters are located in and specialists that have either an industry or functional expertise. Unlike some competing consulting firms, McKinsey does not hold a policy against working for multiple competing companies (although individual consultants are barred from doing so). Recruiting McKinsey & Company was the first management consultancy to hire recent graduates instead of experienced business managers, when it started doing so in 1953. By 2009, less than half of the firm's recruits were business majors; by 1999, recruits had advanced degrees in science, medicine, engineering or law. According to a 1997 article in The Observer, McKinsey recruited recent graduates and \\"imbue[d] them with a religious conviction\\" in the firm, then cull[ed] through them with its \\"up-or-out\\" policy. The \\"up or out\\" policy, which was established in 1951, meant that consultants that were not being promoted within the firm were asked to leave. By 1997, about one-fifth of McKinsey's consultants departed under the up or out policy each year. McKinsey's practice of hiring recent graduates and the \\"up-or-out\\" philosophy, were originally based on Marvin Bower's experiences at the law firm Jones Day in the 1930s, as well as the \\"Cravath system\\" used at the law firm Cravath, Swaine and Moore. The work environment is demanding, involving extensive travel and long hours. In 2018, 800,000 candidates applied for 8,000 jobs. McKinsey is often ranked as the company with the hardest job interviews in the world. Culture A November 1, 1993, profile story in Fortune magazine said that McKinsey & Company was \\"the most well-known, most secretive, most high-priced, most prestigious, most consistently successful, most envied, most trusted, most disliked management consulting firm on earth\\". In the article, McKinsey was cited as saying that its consultants were not motivated by money. and that partners talked to each other with \\"a sense of personal affection and admiration\\". The article described a culture clash that occurred in the early 1990s, leading to the departure of 151 out of the 254 ICG staff members. In their 1997 book Dangerous company : management consultants and the businesses they save and ruin, authors James O'Shea and Charles Madigan said that McKinsey's culture had often been compared to religion, because of the influence, loyalty and zeal of its members. The firm has a policy against discussing specific client situations. A September 1997 The News Observer story said that McKinsey's internal culture was \\"collegiate and ruthlessly competitive\\" and has been described as arrogant. Ethan Rasiel's 1999 book entitled The McKinsey Way, described a culture at McKinsey's whereby members were not supposed to \\"sell\\" their services. The Sunday Times wrote that McKinsey was a pioneer in the industry‚Äî the \\"first firm to hire MBA graduates from the top business schools to staff its projects, rather than relying on older industry personnel.\\" They were still trying to keep a \\"very low profile public image\\" in 2005. That year, an article in The Guardian said that McKinsey \\"hours are long, expectations high and failure not acceptable\\". According to an October 2009 Reuters article, the firm had a \\"button-down culture\\" focused on \\"playing by the rules\\". In his 2013 book, The Firm: the Story of McKinsey and its Secret Influence on American Business, Duff McDonald, described how McKinsey's consultants were expected to become a part of the community and recruit clients from church, charitable foundations, board positions and other community involvements. McDonald wrote that McKinsey calls itself \\"The Firm\\" and its employees \\"members\\". BusinessWeek summarized The Firm's description of McKinsey's as a \\"fading empire, where hubris and changing times have diminished the firm's statures.\\" In his February 2020 in-depth article in The Atlantic, Daniel Markovits argues that McKinsey promotes \\"intellect and elite credentials\\" and \\"Meritocrats\\" over \\"directly relevant experience\\". Conflicts of interest between McKinsey and MIO partners In February 2019, The New York Times ran a series of articles about McKinsey and the in- house hedge fund it operates ‚Äì McKinsey Investment Office, or MIO Partners. The articles claimed that there was \\"potential for undisclosed conflicts of interest between the fund's investments and the advice the firm sells to clients\\", since the hedge fund could benefit from the inside knowledge obtained through management consulting services. The firm responded that \\"MIO and McKinsey employ separate staffs. MIO staff have no nonpublic knowledge of McKinsey clients. For the vast majority of assets under management, decisions about specific investments are made by third-party managers\\". The firm has agreed to repay fees it earned in three bankruptcy cases, approximately $15 million worth. Influence Many of McKinsey's alumni become CEOs of major corporations or hold important government positions. In doing so, they influence the other organization with McKinsey's values and culture. McKinsey's alumni have been appointed as CEOs or high-level executives at Google, American Express, Facebook, Boeing, IBM, Westinghouse Electric, Sears, AT&T;, PepsiCo, and Enron. McKinsey alumni have held positions with Tony Blair's office. Citicorp and Merrill Lynch have also hired many McKinsey alumni. As of 2008, McKinsey alumni held CEO positions with 16 corporations that have more than $2 billion in revenue. The firm was ranked by USA Today as the most likely company to work for and become a future CEO of a major corporation, with odds of 1 out of 690. Some say McKinsey's consulting work has had an influence on norms of how governments and corporations are run. An in-depth September 1993 celebratory Bloomberg article, \\"The McKinsey Mystique\\", described how McKinsey provided a valued training ground for future CEOs, including the CEOs of American Express, IBM, and Westinghouse‚Äî\\"three of America's corporate titans.\\" In his 2010 publication, The Lords of Strategy: The Secret Intellectual History of the New Corporate World, business journalist Walter Kiechel traced the roots of a profound change in corporate management to \\"four mavericks\\" in the 1960s‚ÄîFred Gluck at McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group's Bruce Henderson, Bill Bain at Bain & Company's, and Harvard Business School professor, Michael Porter. Kiechel recounted how they \\"revolutionized the way we think about business, changed the very soul of the corporation, and transformed the way we work,\\" according to the Harvard Business Press synopsis. McKinsey has been either directly involved in, or closely associated with, a number of notable scandals, involving Enron in 2001, Galleon in 2009, Valeant in 2015, Saudi Arabia in 2018, China in 2018, ICE in 2019, an internal conflict of interest in 2019 and Purdue Pharma in 2019, among others. By 2019, major news outlets, including The New York Times and ProPublica, had raised concerns about McKinsey's business practices. Research and publishing McKinsey & Company consultants regularly publish books, research and articles about business and management. The firm spends $50‚Äì$100 million a year on research. McKinsey was one of the first organizations to fund management research, when it founded the Foundation for Management Research in 1955. The firm began publishing a business magazine, The McKinsey Quarterly, in 1964. It funds the McKinsey Global Institute, which studies global economic trends and was founded in 1990. Many consultants are contributors to the Harvard Business Review. McKinsey consultants published only two books from 1960-1980, then more than 50 from 1980 to 1996. McKinsey's publications and research give the firm a \\"quasi-academic\\" image. A McKinsey book, In Search of Excellence, was published in 1982. It featured eight characteristics of successful businesses based on an analysis of 43 top performing companies. It marked the beginning of McKinsey's shift from accounting to \\"softer\\" aspects of management, like skills and culture. According to David Guest from King's College, In Search of Excellence became popular among business managers because it was easy to read, well-marketed and some of its core messages were valid. However, it was disliked by academics because of flaws in its methodology. Additionally, a 1984 analysis by BusinessWeek found that many of those companies identified as \\"excellent\\" in the book no longer met the criteria only two years later. A 1997 article and a book it published in 2001 on \\"The War for Talent\\" prompted academics and the business community to start focusing more on talent management. The authors found that the best-performing companies were \\"obsessed\\" with acquiring and managing the best talent. They advocated that companies rank employees by their performance and promote \\"stars\\", while targeting under-performers for improvement or layoffs. After the book was published, Enron, a company which followed many of its principles, was involved in a scandal that led to its bankruptcy. In May 2001, a Stanford professor wrote a paper critical of the \\"War on Talent\\" arguing that it prioritized individuals at the expense of the larger organization. McKinsey consultants published Creative Destruction in 2001. The book suggested that CEOs need to be willing to change or rebuild a company, rather than protect what they have created. It found that out of the first S&P; 500 list from 1957, only 74 were still in business by 1998. The New York Times said it \\"makes a cogent argument that in times of rampant, uncertain change ... established companies are handcuffed by success.\\" In 2009, McKinsey consultants published The Alchemy of Growth, which established three \\"horizons\\" for growth: core enhancements, new growth platforms and options. In February 2011, McKinsey surveyed 1,300 US private-sector employers on their expected response to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Thirty percent of respondents said they anticipated they would probably or definitely stop offering employer sponsored health coverage after the ACA went into effect in 2014. These results, published in June 2011 in the McKinsey e-Quarterly, became \\"a useful tool for critics of the ACA and a deep annoyance for defenders of the law\\" according to an article in TIME Magazine. Supporters of healthcare reform argued the survey far surpassed estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and insisted that McKinsey disclose the survey's methodology. Two weeks after publishing the survey results, McKinsey released the contents of the survey including the questionnaire and 206-pages of survey data. In its accompanying statement, McKinsey said it was intended to capture the attitude of employers at a certain point in time, not make a prediction. Since 1990, McKinsey has been publishing Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies, a textbook on valuation. =Environmental consulting= Marginal abatement cost curves attempt to compare the financial costs of different options for reducing pollution in a region and are used in emissions trading, policy discussions and incentive programs. McKinsey & Company released its first marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve for greenhouse gas emissions in February 2007, which was updated to version two in January 2009. McKinsey & Company's MAC curve has become the most widely used and is the basis for McKinsey's consulting on climate change and sustainability. McKinsey's curve predicts negative cost abatement strategies, which has been controversial among economists. The International Association for Energy Economics said in The Energy Journal that McKinsey's cost-curve was popular among policymakers, because it suggests they can take \\"bold action towards improving energy efficiency without imposing costs on society.\\" In a 2010 report, the Rainforest Foundation UK said McKinsey's cost curve methodology was misleading for policy decisions regarding the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) program. The report argued that McKinsey's calculations exclude certain implementation and governance costs, which makes it favor industrial uses of forests while discouraging subsistence projects. Greenpeace said the curve has allowed Indonesia and Guyana to win financial incentives from the United Nations by creating inflated estimates of current deforestation so they could demonstrate reductions in comparison. McKinsey said they had made it clear in the cost-curve publications that cost curves do not translate \\"mechanically\\" into policy implications and that policymakers should consider \\"many other factors\\" before introducing new laws. Significant consulting projects According to The Firm, McKinsey has been influential in establishing the norms of business, such as working in large- scale office settings. According to a 1993 profile in Fortune magazine, \\"while McKinsey has consulted for many of the current era's great successes ... it has also been a fixture at many of the big losers.\\" In The Firm, author Duff McDonald said McKinsey helped restructure the White House, guided corporations through large-scale re-organizations in post-war Europe and facilitated turn- arounds, but in other cases advised companies to adopt strategies that led to their collapse or was unable to prevent an impending bankruptcy. MacDonald wrote, McKinsey & Company's founder, James O. McKinsey, introduced the concept of budget planning as a management framework in his fifth book Budgetary Control in 1922. The firm's first client was the treasurer of Armour & Company, who, along with other early McKinsey clients, had read Budgetary Control. In 1931 McKinsey created a methodology for analyzing a company called the General Survey Outline (GSO), which was established based on ideas introduced in the 1924 book Business Administration. It was also known as the Banker's Survey, because McKinsey's clients who used it in the 1930s were predominantly banks. After the Wagner Act gave certain rights to employees to organize into unions in 1935, McKinsey started consulting corporations on employee relations. Later in the 1950s, the work of a McKinsey consultant on compensation was influential in \\"skyrocketing executive pay\\". It also helped many companies such as Heinz, IBM and Hoover expand into Europe. In the 1940s, McKinsey helped many corporations convert into wartime production for World War II. It also helped organize NASA into an organization that relies heavily on contractors in 1958. McKinsey created a report in 1953 for Dwight Eisenhower that was used to guide government appointments. In 1973, McKinsey & Company led a project for a consortium of grocery chains represented by the U.S. Supermarket Ad Hoc Committee on a Uniform Grocery Product Code to create the barcode. According to the book \\"Business Research Methods\\", the barcode became commonplace after a study by McKinsey persuaded Kroger to adopt it. In the 1970s and 1980s, McKinsey helped European companies change their organizational structure to M-form (Multidivisional Form), which organizes the company into semi-autonomous divisions that function around a product, industry or customer, rather than a function or expertise. In the 1980s, AT&T; reduced investments in cell towers due to McKinsey's prediction that there would only be 900,000 cell phone subscribers by 2000. According to The Firm this was \\"laughably off the mark\\" from the 109 million cellular subscribers by 2000. At the time cell phones were bulky and expensive. The firm helped the Dutch government facilitate a turnaround for Hoogovens, the world's largest steel company as of 2013, through a $1 billion bankruptcy bailout. It also implemented a turnaround for the city of Glasgow, which had problems with unemployment and crime. McKinsey created the corporate structure for NationsBank, when it was still a small company known as North Carolina National Bank. McKinsey was hired by General Motors to do a large-scale re- organization to help it compete with Japanese auto-makers. The book The Firm said it was an \\"unmitigated disaster\\" because McKinsey focused on corporate structure, whereas GM needed to compete with Japanese automakers through manufacturing process improvement. A McKinsey consultant said GM did not follow their advice. A 2002 article in BusinessWeek said that a series of bankruptcies of McKinsey clients, such as Swissair, Kmart, and Global Crossing, in the 1990s raised questions as to whether McKinsey was responsible or had a lapse in judgement. McKinsey recommended that Swissair avoid high operating costs in its home country by developing partnerships with airlines based in other regions. In order to attract partners, Swissair acquired more than $1 billion in shares of other airlines, many of which were failing. This led to huge losses for Swissair. As part of a lawsuit against Allstate, 13,000 McKinsey documents were released, showing showed that McKinsey recommended that Allstate reduce payouts to insurance claimants by offering low settlements, delaying processing to wear out claimants through attrition, and fighting customers that protest in court. Allstate's profits doubled over ten years after adopting McKinsey's strategy, but it also led to lawsuits alleging they were cheating claimants out of legitimate insurance claims. Enron Enron was the creation of Jeff Skilling, a McKinsey consultant of 21 years, who was jailed after Enron collapsed. McKinsey reportedly \\"fully endorsed the dubious accounting methods that caused the company to implode in 2001.\\" Enron reportedly used McKinsey on 20 different projects, and McKinsey consultants had \\"used Enron as their sandbox.\\" Prior to the Enron scandal, McKinsey helped it shift from an oil and gas production company into an electric commodities trader, which led to significant growth in profits and revenues. According to The Independent, there was \\"no suggestion that McKinsey was complicit in the subsequent scandal, [but] critics say the arrogance of Enron's leaders is emblematic of the McKinsey culture.\\" The government did not investigate McKinsey, who said they did not provide advice on Enron's accounting. The Wall Street Journal questioned McKinsey's \\"liability\\" and its \\"close relationship with Enron\\". and a 2002 BusinessWeek suggested they had ignored warning signs. In his July 2002 in-depth BusinessWeek article on the aftermath of the Enron scandal, John Bryne wrote that, McKinsey had been a \\"key architect of the strategic thinking that made Enron a Wall Street darling. In books, articles, and essays, its partners regularly stamped their imprimatur on many of Enron's strategies and practices, helping to position the energy giant as a corporate innovator worthy of emulation. The firm may not be the subject of any investigations, but its close involvement with Enron raises the question of whether McKinsey, like some other professional firms, ignored warning flags in order to keep an important account.\\" BusinessWeek described how McKinsey's culture had changed, as the \\"number of partners grew from 427 to 891\\" making it a \\"less personal place\\". According to the article, \\"some current and former McKinsey consultants\\" said that McKinsey's had lost their \\"ingrained values\\" that used to guide the firm. Citing the example of the dot-com bubble, McKinsey had begun to have \\"less prestigious companies\\" as clients and had allowed \\"its focus on building agenda-shaping relationships with top management at leading companies to slip.\\" As well, \\"there was a noticeable tilt toward bringing in revenue at the expense of developing knowledge.\\" McKinsey denied this. McKinsey denied giving Enron advice on financing issues or having suspicions that Enron was using improper accounting methods. 2008 financial crisis McKinsey is said to have played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis by promoting the securitization of mortgage assets and encouraged the banks to fund their balance sheets with debt, driving up risk, which \\"poisoned the global financial system and precipitated the 2008 credit meltdown\\". Furthermore, McKinsey advised Allstate Insurance to purposefully give low offers to claimants. The Huffington Post revealed that the strategy was to make claims \\"so expensive and so time-consuming that lawyers would start refusing to help clients.\\" Next to this, 2016 McKinsey partner Navdeep Arora was convicted for illegally depleting State Farm of over $500,000 over a period of 8 years, in collaboration with a State Farm employee. Valeant Valeant, a Canadian pharmaceutical company investigated by the SEC in 2015, has been accused of improper accounting, and that it used predatory price hikes to boost growth. The Financial Times states that \\"Valeant's downfall is not exactly McKinsey's fault but its fingerprints are everywhere.\\" Three out of six senior executives were recent ex-McKinsey employees, as well as the chair of the 'talent and compensation' committee. Role in opioid epidemic McKinsey advised opioid makers on how to ‚Äúturbocharge‚Äù sales of OxyContin, propose strategies \\"to counter the emotional messages from mothers with teenagers that overdosed\\" on OxyContin, and help opioid makers to circumvent regulation.  Rikers Island jail complex  New York City paid McKinsey $27.5 million between 2014 and 2017 to reduce prison assaults in Rikers Island; but the violence grew and the city abandoned many of the firm‚Äôs recommendations. The consultancy's alleged failings included not soliciting the views of inmates or clinic staff; using an encrypted messaging app that deletes messages, allegedly to avoid transparency; initiatives involving the expanded use of Tasers, shotguns and K9 patrol dogs; replacing troublesome inmates with more accommodating ones in the test area, which skewed the data in favor of the project; the use of ineffective data-analytics software; and spreadsheet errors that inflated the baseline rate of violence, against which the project was measured. Controversial clients and association with authoritarian regimes =Role in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)= McKinsey stopped working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after it was disclosed that the firm had done more than $20 million in consulting work for the agency. McKinsey managing partner Kevin Sneader said the contract, not widely known within the company until The New York Times reported it, had \\"rightly raised\\" concerns. In 2019, The New York Times and ProPublica reported on newly uncovered documents which showed that McKinsey, as part of its work with ICE, proposed cuts in spending on food and medical care for migrants. McKinsey also advocated for an acceleration of the deportation process, causing concerns among ICE staff that the due process rights of the migrants would be violated. Previously, McKinsey managing partner, Kevin Sneader, had claimed that McKinsey had done no work for ICE in terms of developing and implementing immigration policy; the uncovered documents showed that to be false. =Role in Saudi clampdown on dissidents= In October 2018, in the wake of the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and journalist, The New York Times reported that McKinsey had identified the most prominent Saudi dissidents on Twitter and that the Saudi government subsequently repressed the dissidents and their families. One of the dissidents was arrested. Another dissident's family members were arrested, and the cell phone of the dissident was hacked. McKinsey issued a statement, saying \\"We are horrified by the possibility, however remote, that [the report] could have been misused. We have seen no evidence to suggest that it was misused, but we are urgently investigating how and with whom the document was shared.\\" In December 2018, The New York Times reported that \\"the kingdom is a such a vital client for the firm ‚Äî the source of nearly 600 projects from 2011 to 2016 alone ‚Äî that McKinsey chose to participate in a major Saudi investment conference in October 2018 even after the killing and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist by Saudi agents.\\" On February 12, 2019, the European Parliament Greens/EFA group presented a motion for a resolution on the situation on women‚Äôs rights defenders in Saudi Arabia denouncing the involvement of foreign public relations companies in representing Saudi Arabia and handling its public image, particularly McKinsey & Company. =Support of authoritarian regimes= McKinsey's business and policy support for authoritarian regimes came under scrutiny in December 2018, in the wake of a lavish company retreat in China held adjacent to Chinese government internment camps where thousands of Uyghurs were being detained without cause. In the preceding few years, McKinsey's clients included Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy, Turkey's autocratic leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ousted former President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych, and several Chinese and Russian companies under sanctions. South African corruption scandal The Gupta family (no relation to Rajat Gupta) had strategically placed corrupted individuals in various South African government, utilities and infrastructure sectors. It is alleged that McKinsey was complicit in this corruption by using the Guptas to obtain consulting contracts from certain state-owned enterprises, including Eskom and Transnet. Working with Trillian Capital Partners (a consultancy which was owned by a Gupta associate), they provided services to the value of R1 billion ($75 million) annually. Trillian was paid a commission for facilitating the business for McKinsey. McKinsey hired law firm Norton Rose Fulbright to carry out an internal investigation over the allegations. McKinsey's then Managing Partner, Dominic Barton, issued a statement following an internal investigation, in which the firm \\"admitted that it found violations of its professional standards but denied any acts of bribery, corruption, and payments to Trillian.\\" Corruption Watch, a South African non-governmental organization, filed a complaint about the controversial contract to the US Department of Justice, alleging that there was a criminal conspiracy between McKinsey, Trillian and Eskom in contravention of US and South African law. It was revealed in January 2018 that criminal complaints were filed against McKinsey & Company by the South African Companies and Intellectual Property Commission. South African prosecutors confirmed that they would enforce the seizing of assets from McKinsey. South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority concluded in early 2018 that the payments to McKinsey and its local business partner, Trillian, were illegal, involving crimes such as fraud, theft, corruption and money laundering. McKinsey had subsequently been in discussion with Eskom and the National Prosecuting Authority's Asset Forfeiture Unit to agree on a transparent, legally appropriate process for returning the R1-billion (US$74m) it had been paid - it was confirmed on 6 July 2018 that this had been concluded. Eskom confirmed it received R99.5 million in interest from McKinsey on July 23, 2018. The interest payment covers the two years since McKinsey was paid almost R1-billion in 2016. Information relating to allegedly corrupt practices by McKinsey at Transnet in 2011 and 2012 came to light in late July 2018. The weekly Mail & Guardian newspaper reported that a \\"...new forensic treasury report shows how controversial former Transnet and Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh enjoyed overseas trips at the expense of international consulting firm McKinsey, which scored multi-billion rand contracts at the state owned entities.\\" The \\"...report reiterates treasury's recommendations that Singh's conduct with regards to McKinsey should be referred to the elite crime-fighting unit, the Hawks, for investigations under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act (Precca). Under Precca, Singh would be investigated for allegations of corruption as payment for the overseas trips alone would constitute a form of gratification, which is illegal.\\" The Sunday City Press reported that the forensic report in turn reported that \\"multinational advisory firm McKinsey paid for Singh to go on lavish international trips to Dubai, Russia, Germany and the UK, after which their contract with Transnet was massively extended.\\" McKinsey issued a statement that the allegations were incorrect. McKinsey stated that \\"based on an extensive review encompassing interviews, email records and expense documents, our understanding is that McKinsey did not pay for Mr. Singh's airfare and hotel lodgings in connection with the CFO Forum and the meetings that took place around the CFO Forum in London and elsewhere in 2012 and 2013.\\" On 11 October 2019 the United States Treasury department announced that it had imposed wide-ranging financial sanctions on three Gupta brothers, Ajay, Atul and Rajesh (aka Tony) and their business associate Salim Essa under the United States Magnitsky Act. The Economist reported in November 2019, that McKinsey's scandals, such as the 2016 South Africa scandal and the allegations of conflict of interest tied to its $12.7bn investment affiliate, McKinsey Investment Office (MIO), are relatively recent in terms of its long history. The article said that McKinsey's legal challenges facing McKinsey's new global managing partner, Kevin Sneader, may be related to the company's fast-paced growth with an increase of 2,200 partners compared to 2009. During that same time period, the number of employees increased to 30,000 worldwide from 17,000.

Mathematical generalizations Typically, the Newtonian dynamics occurs in a three- dimensional Euclidean space, which is flat. However, in mathematics Newton's laws of motion can be generalized to multidimensional and curved spaces. Often the term Newtonian dynamics is narrowed to Newton's second law \\\\displaystyle m\\\\,\\\\mathbf a=\\\\mathbf F. Newton's second law in a multidimensional space Consider \\\\displaystyle N particles with masses \\\\displaystyle m_1,\\\\,\\\\ldots,\\\\,m_N in the regular three-dimensional Euclidean space. Let \\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf r_1,\\\\,\\\\ldots,\\\\,\\\\mathbf r_N be their radius-vectors in some inertial coordinate system. Then the motion of these particles is governed by Newton's second law applied to each of them The three-dimensional radius-vectors \\\\displaystyle\\\\mathbf r_1,\\\\,\\\\ldots,\\\\,\\\\mathbf r_N can be built into a single \\\\displaystyle n=3N-dimensional radius-vector. Similarly, three- dimensional velocity vectors \\\\displaystyle\\\\mathbf v_1,\\\\,\\\\ldots,\\\\,\\\\mathbf v_N can be built into a single \\\\displaystyle n=3N-dimensional velocity vector: In terms of the multidimensional vectors () the equations () are written as i.e. they take the form of Newton's second law applied to a single particle with the unit mass \\\\displaystyle m=1. Definition. The equations () are called the equations of a Newtonian dynamical system in a flat multidimensional Euclidean space, which is called the configuration space of this system. Its points are marked by the radius-vector \\\\displaystyle\\\\mathbf r. The space whose points are marked by the pair of vectors \\\\displaystyle(\\\\mathbf r,\\\\mathbf v) is called the phase space of the dynamical system (). Euclidean structure The configuration space and the phase space of the dynamical system () both are Euclidean spaces, i. e. they are equipped with a Euclidean structure. The Euclidean structure of them is defined so that the kinetic energy of the single multidimensional particle with the unit mass \\\\displaystyle m=1 is equal to the sum of kinetic energies of the three-dimensional particles with the masses \\\\displaystyle m_1,\\\\,\\\\ldots,\\\\,m_N: Constraints and internal coordinates In some cases the motion of the particles with the masses \\\\displaystyle m_1,\\\\,\\\\ldots,\\\\,m_N can be constrained. Typical constraints look like scalar equations of the form Constraints of the form () are called holonomic and scleronomic. In terms of the radius-vector \\\\displaystyle\\\\mathbf r of the Newtonian dynamical system () they are written as Each such constraint reduces by one the number of degrees of freedom of the Newtonian dynamical system (). Therefore, the constrained system has \\\\displaystyle n=3\\\\,N-K degrees of freedom. Definition. The constraint equations () define an \\\\displaystyle n-dimensional manifold \\\\displaystyle M within the configuration space of the Newtonian dynamical system (). This manifold \\\\displaystyle M is called the configuration space of the constrained system. Its tangent bundle \\\\displaystyle TM is called the phase space of the constrained system. Let \\\\displaystyle q^1,\\\\,\\\\ldots,\\\\,q^n be the internal coordinates of a point of \\\\displaystyle M. Their usage is typical for the Lagrangian mechanics. The radius-vector \\\\displaystyle\\\\mathbf r is expressed as some definite function of \\\\displaystyle q^1,\\\\,\\\\ldots,\\\\,q^n: The vector-function () resolves the constraint equations () in the sense that upon substituting () into () the equations () are fulfilled identically in \\\\displaystyle q^1,\\\\,\\\\ldots,\\\\,q^n. Internal presentation of the velocity vector The velocity vector of the constrained Newtonian dynamical system is expressed in terms of the partial derivatives of the vector-function (): The quantities \\\\displaystyle\\\\dot q^1,\\\\,\\\\ldots,\\\\,\\\\dot q^n are called internal components of the velocity vector. Sometimes they are denoted with the use of a separate symbol and then treated as independent variables. The quantities are used as internal coordinates of a point of the phase space \\\\displaystyle TM of the constrained Newtonian dynamical system. Embedding and the induced Riemannian metric Geometrically, the vector-function () implements an embedding of the configuration space \\\\displaystyle M of the constrained Newtonian dynamical system into the \\\\displaystyle 3\\\\,N-dimensional flat configuration space of the unconstrained Newtonian dynamical system (). Due to this embedding the Euclidean structure of the ambient space induces the Riemannian metric onto the manifold \\\\displaystyle M. The components of the metric tensor of this induced metric are given by the formula where \\\\displaystyle(\\\\ ,\\\\ ) is the scalar product associated with the Euclidean structure (). Kinetic energy of a constrained Newtonian dynamical system Since the Euclidean structure of an unconstrained system of \\\\displaystyle N particles is introduced through their kinetic energy, the induced Riemannian structure on the configuration space \\\\displaystyle N of a constrained system preserves this relation to the kinetic energy: The formula () is derived by substituting () into () and taking into account (). Constraint forces For a constrained Newtonian dynamical system the constraints described by the equations () are usually implemented by some mechanical framework. This framework produces some auxiliary forces including the force that maintains the system within its configuration manifold \\\\displaystyle M. Such a maintaining force is perpendicular to \\\\displaystyle M. It is called the normal force. The force \\\\displaystyle\\\\mathbf F from () is subdivided into two components The first component in () is tangent to the configuration manifold \\\\displaystyle M. The second component is perpendicular to \\\\displaystyle M. In coincides with the normal force \\\\displaystyle\\\\mathbf N. Like the velocity vector (), the tangent force \\\\displaystyle\\\\mathbf F_\\\\parallel has its internal presentation The quantities F^1,\\\\,\\\\ldots,\\\\,F^n in () are called the internal components of the force vector. Newton's second law in a curved space The Newtonian dynamical system () constrained to the configuration manifold \\\\displaystyle M by the constraint equations () is described by the differential equations where \\\\Gamma^s_{ij} are Christoffel symbols of the metric connection produced by the Riemannian metric (). Relation to Lagrange equations Mechanical systems with constraints are usually described by Lagrange equations: where T=T(q^1,\\\\ldots,q^n,w^1,\\\\ldots,w^n) is the kinetic energy the constrained dynamical system given by the formula (). The quantities Q_1,\\\\,\\\\ldots,\\\\,Q_n in () are the inner covariant components of the tangent force vector \\\\mathbf F_\\\\parallel (see () and ()).

It is usually seen in pairs or small flocks in open habitats on the plains of the Indian subcontinent. Description A young bird with the base of the mandible grey, Rajasthan This myna is pale buff creamy with a black cap and a loose crest. The bill is yellow with a bluish base. The iris is pale and there is a bluish patch of skin around the eye. The outer tail feathers have white and the black primaries of the wings do not have any white patches. The adult male has a more prominent crest than the female and also has longer neck hackles. Juveniles are duller and the cap is browner. The species name pagodarum is thought to be based on occurrence of the species on buildings and temple pagodas in southern India. Distribution and habitat It is a resident breeder in Nepal and India, a winter visitor to Sri Lanka and a summer visitor in parts of the western and northeastern Himalayas. They are spotted in the plains of Pakistan as well. They have musical call notes that are long, made up of a series of slurred notes that end abruptly. Although mainly seen on the plains, there are a few records from above 3,000m, mainly from Ladakh. This passerine is typically found in dry forest, scrub jungle and cultivation and is often found close to human habitations. They especially favour areas with waterlogged or marshy lands. Behaviour and ecology Like most starlings, the brahminy starling is omnivorous, eating fruit and insects. They have been known to feed on the fruits of Thevetia peruviana which are toxic to many vertebrates. These birds are not as arboreal as the grey-headed mynas and they form small flocks that mix with other mynas on grass covered ground. They sometimes forage beside grazing cattle. They also visit flowers for nectar, particularly Salmalia, Butea monosperma and Erythrina. They roost communally in large numbers in leafy trees, often in the company of parakeets and other mynas. It builds its nest in tree holes or artificial cavities. The breeding season is March to September but varies with location, being earlier in southern India. The season coincides with the fruiting of many plants and the young hatch just as the rains begin. The male selects the nest, sometimes having to compete with other hole-nesters such as barbets and sparrows. The male displays by puffing up feathers, fanning the tail, erecting the crest and raising up its bill. Both sexes take part in nest building. The nest is lined with grass, feathers and rags. The normal clutch is three to four eggs which are pale bluish green. The females do not add replacement eggs when eggs are removed nor do they stop laying if an egg is artificially added. Incubation begins only after laying the second egg with the female brooding at night with the male share limited to brief periods during the day. The eggs hatch in about 12 to 14 days. The young fledge and leave the nest when they are three weeks old. The young are fed with insects in the early stages and grains in the later stages. After feeding the parents wait for the young to eject faecal pellets which they carefully remove and drop about away from the nest. Two or three broods may be raised in succession. Taxonomy and systematics The starling genera were found to be polyphyletic on the basis of molecular phylogeny and this has led to changes in the genus placements. This species has been traditionally placed in the genus Sturnus and Temenuchus, but a 2008 study confidently placed it within the genus Sturnia.

The ten Attic orators were considered the greatest orators and logographers of the classical era (5th‚Äì4th century BC). They are included in the \\"Canon of Ten\\", which probably originated in Alexandria. A.E. Douglas has argued, however, that it was not until the second century AD that the canon took on the form that is recognised today. Alexandrian \\"Canon of Ten\\" * Aeschines * Andocides * Antiphon * Demosthenes * Dinarchus * Hypereides * Isaeus * Isocrates * Lycurgus * Lysias As far as Homer (8th or 9th century BC), the art of effective speaking was of considerable value in Greece. In Homer's epic, the Iliad, the warrior, Achilles, was described as \\"a speaker of words and a doer of deeds\\".Iliad 9.443 Until the 5th century BC, however, oratory was not formally taught. In fact, it is not until the middle of that century that the Sicilian orator, Corax, along with his pupil, Tisias, began a formal study of rhetoric. In 427 BC, another Sicilian named Gorgias of Leontini visited Athens and gave a speech which apparently dazzled the citizens. Gorgias‚Äôs \\"intellectual\\" approach to oratory, which included new ideas, forms of expression, and methods of argument, was continued by Isocrates, a 4th-century BC educator and rhetorician. Oratory eventually became a central subject of study in the formalized Greek education system. The work of the Attic orators inspired the later rhetorical movement of Atticism, an approach to speech composition in a simple rather than ornate style.

IRA volunteers had been lying in wait outside the barracks and, as the officers left, two gunmen stepped out of concealed positions and shot both officers in the head from close range. Another IRA unit then directed heavy machine-gun fire at the front of the barracks, which provided cover for a bomb team to plant a 100 lb (45 kg) bomb inside. The bomb exploded ten minutes later, destroying the barracks. Three other RUC officers who were in the building fled through a back door.

Major Shaw died at the scene. *25 April 1987: an off duty British soldier (William Graham) was shot dead by the IRA at his family's farm, off Gortscraheen Road, near Pomeroy. This was the last action by the Brigade before Loughgall. Lynagh's strategy In the 1980s, the IRA in East Tyrone and other areas close to the border, such as South Armagh, were following a Maoist military theoryEnglish, Richard. Armed Struggle: a History of the IRA, page 254 devised for Ireland by Jim Lynagh, a high-profile member of the IRA in East Tyrone (but a native of County Monaghan). The theory involved creating \\"no-go zones\\" that the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) did not control and gradually expanding them. Lynagh's strategy was to start off with one area which the British military did not control, preferably a republican stronghold such as east Tyrone. The South Armagh area was considered to be a liberated zone already, since British troops and the RUC could not use the roads there for fear of roadside bombs and long-range harassing fire. Thus it was from there that the IRA East Tyrone Brigade attacks were launched, with most of them occurring in east Tyrone in areas close to south Armagh, which offered good escape routes. The first phase of Lynagh's plan to drive out the British security forces from east Tyrone involved destroying isolated rural police stations and then intimidating or killing any building contractors who were employed to rebuild them. Lynagh's plans met strong criticism from senior brigade member Kevin McKenna, who regarded the strategy as \\"too impractical, too ambitious, and not sustainable\\" according to journalist Ed Moloney. The IRA Northern Command, however, approved a scaled-down version of the strategy, aimed at hampering the repair and refurbishment of British security bases.Moloney, pp. 313‚Äì314 Scottish-born journalist Kevin Toolis has written that from 1985 onward, the brigade led a five-year campaign that left 33 security facilities destroyed and nearly 100 seriously damaged.Toolis, Kevin. Rebel Hearts: journeys within the IRA's soul (1995). Picador, p. 53; In July 1983, the East Tyrone Brigade carried out a landmine attack on an Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) mobile patrol near Ballygawley, killing three UDR soldiers (a fourth UDR soldier died later). In 1985 and 1986, the East Tyrone Brigade carried out two attacks on RUC bases in their operational area, described by author Mark Urban as \\"spectaculars\\".Urban, p. 224 The first was an assault on Ballygawley base in December 1985. Two RUC officers were shot dead and the base was raked with gunfire before being destroyed by a bomb.RUC memorial The second was an attack on the part-time base at The Birches, County Armagh, in August 1986. The base was raked with gunfire and a JCB digger with a 200 lb (91 kg) bomb in its bucket was driven through the perimeter fence. The bomb detonated, destroying much of the base and damaging nearby buildings. In April 1987 the brigade shot and killed Harold Henry, one of the main building contractors to the security forces in Northern Ireland.Toolis, Rebel Hearts, p. 65 Loughgall ambush Mural commemorating those killed in the Loughgall Ambush On 8 May 1987, at least eight members of the brigade launched another attack on the unmanned Loughgall RUC base. The IRA unit used the same tactics as it had done in The Birches attack.Urban, p. 227 It destroyed a substantial part of the base with a 200 lb bomb and raked the building with gunfire. However, as their attack was underway, the IRA unit was ambushed by a Special Air Service (SAS) unit. The SAS shot dead eight IRA members and a civilian who had accidentally driven into the ambush. This was the IRA's greatest loss of life in a single incident since the days of the Anglo-Irish War (1919‚Äì1922). Six IRA members from a supporting unit managed to escape. The Volunteers killed at Loughgall were Declan Arthurs (21), Tony Gormley (24), Eugene Kelly (25), P√°draig McKearney (32), Jim Lynagh (31), Gerard O'Callaghan (28), Seamus Donnelly (19) and unit commander Patrick Joseph Kelly (30).Raymond Murray, The SAS in Ireland (1990).

In 2012 a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club in Tyrone distanced itself from a republican commemoration of those killed in the ambush. This was in response to a complaint from Democratic Unionist Party Assemblyman William McCrea accusing the GAA of turning a blind eye to \\"republican terrorist\\" events in the last years. GAA Central Council official reply was that \\"The GAA has strict protocols and rules in place regarding the use of property for Political purposes. (...) The Association is committed to a shared future based on tolerance for the different identities and cultural backgrounds of people who share this Community and this island.\\"\\"GAA distances itself from IRA commemorations\\", midulstermail.co.uk, 19 April 2012. Subsequent brigade activity In the aftermath of the Loughgall ambush The SAS ambush had no noticeable long-term effect on the level of IRA activity in East Tyrone. The level of IRA activity in the area did not show any real decline in the aftermath: in the two years prior to the Loughgall ambush the IRA killed seven people in East Tyrone and North Armagh, and eleven in the two years following the ambush.Urban, p. 242 Additionally, most of the attacks which took place in County Fermanagh during this period of the Troubles were also launched from south Tyrone and Monaghan. However, many of their remaining activists were young and inexperienced and fell into further ambushes, leading to high casualties by the standards of the low intensity guerrilla conflict in Northern Ireland. Ed Moloney, Irish journalist and author of the Secret History of the IRA, states that the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade lost 53 members killed in the Troubles, the highest of any rural Brigade area. Of these, 28 were killed between 1987 and 1992.Moloney, Secret History of the IRA, p. 319 A major IRA attack in County Tyrone took place on 20 August 1988, barely a year after Loughall, which ended in the deaths of eight soldiers when a British Army bus was bombed at Curr Road, near Ballygawley. The soldiers were being transported from RAF Aldergrove to a military base near Omagh after returning from leave in England. This attack forced the British military to ferry their troops to and from East Tyrone by helicopter. On 30 August 1988, an SAS ambush killed IRA members Gerard Harte, Martin Harte and Brian Mullin as they tried to kill an off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment member near Carrickmore.\\"DUP slams GAA club IRA commemoration\\", Nuzhound.com, 27 September 2003.

According to journalist Ed Moloney, Michael \\"Pete\\" Ryan (himself killed with two other PIRA volunteers on 3 June 1991), an alleged top Brigade member, was the commander of the IRA flying column that launched the attack on Derryard checkpoint in Fermanagh on 13 December 1989. British military sources reported that other IRA volunteers from East Tyrone were involved in the assault. The checkpoint was stormed and two British soldiers (James Houston and Michael Patterson) were killed in action.Moloney, p. 333 Journalist Ian Bruce claims that an unidentified Irishman who had served in the Parachute Regiment was the leader of the IRA unit, citing intelligence sources.Bruce, Ian. \\"Ex-Para 'led attack by IRA which killed Scots soldiers'\\", Herald Scotland, 2 January 1990.

Another IRA bomb attack on 12 May 1992, against British troops on patrol near Cappagh, in which a paratrooper lost both legs, triggered a series of clashes on that date between soldiers and local residents in the staunchly republican town of Coalisland, on 12 and 17 May 1992. The 12 May riots ended with the paratroopers' assault on three bars, where they injured seven civilians. Another street fracas five days later, on 17 May, between a King's Own Scottish Borderers platoon and a group of nationalist youths in Coalisland resulted in the theft of an army machine gun and a new confrontation with the paratroopers.See the 12 May and 17 May entries at the 1992 CAIN chronology: *May 1992\\"New Paratroop Controversy\\" , emigrant.ie, 18 May 1992; accessed 6 October 2015.Fortnight, Issues 302‚Äì312, Fortnight Publications, 1992.

Eight were killed and the rest were badly wounded. The bombing was at Teebane Crossroads, near Cookstown. One of the workers killed, Robert Dunseath, was an off-duty Royal Irish Rangers soldier. The IRA said that the men were legitimate targets because they were \\"collaborating\\" with the \\"forces of occupation\\". As the men were all Protestants, many Protestants saw it as a sectarian attack. The UDA retaliated by shooting dead five Catholic male civilians inside a betting shop on the Ormeau Road, Belfast.O'Brien, The Long War, pp. 219‚Äì20. IRA volunteers in Tyrone were the target of an assassination campaign carried out by the loyalist paramilitaries of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).

According to 2007 statistics, 99.81% of deceased Japanese are cremated.Cremation Society of G.B. - International Cremation Statistics 2007 Other practices in Japan include Shinto funerals and sepultural culture in the Ryukyu islands. Modern funerals After death Although Japan has become a more secular society (see Religion in Japan), 91% of funerals are conducted as Buddhist ceremonies. Immediately after a death (or, in earlier days, just before the expected death), relatives moisten the dying or deceased person's lips with water, a practice known as . Most Japanese homes maintain Buddhist altars, or , for use in Buddhist ceremonies; and many also have Shinto shrines, or . When a death occurs, the shrine is closed and covered with white paper to keep out the impure spirits of the dead, a custom called . A small table decorated with flowers, incense, and a candle is placed next to the deceased's bed. The relatives and authorities are informed, and a death certificate is issued. Funeral arrangements typically are made by the eldest son and are begun by contacting a temple to schedule the event. Some days are more auspicious than others, based on an old Chinese six-day lunar cycle; in particular, the second day, called , is superstitiously understood to mean \\"pulling your friends along with you\\" (tomo = friends; hiku = pull, although the original significance was different) and is therefore considered a terrible day for a funeral but a good day for a wedding. The body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. An \\"encoffining\\" ritual (called a n≈çkan) is sometimes performed, in which professional ritually dress and prepare the body and place it in the coffin (this is portrayed in the 2008 film Departures). The ceremony is now rarely performed, and may be limited to rural areas where older traditions are maintained. Whether or not the encoffining ceremony is performed, a deceased female is dressed in a white kimono, and a deceased male is dressed in a suit or a kimono. Makeup may be applied. The body is put on dry ice in a casket. Items‚Äîsuch as a white kimono, a pair of sandals, six coins for crossing the River of Three Crossings, and burnable items of which the deceased was fond (for example, cigarettes and candy) are placed in the casket, which is then put on an altar for the wake. The body is placed with its head toward the north or, as a second choice, toward the west. In Buddhism, the western orientation reflects the western realm of Amida Buddha. During life, both men and women cross the front of a kimono or yukata with the left side over the right. On those occasions in which the corpse is clothed in a traditional kimono, the kimono is crossed right over left. Wake Traditional design of the envelope for condolence money Funeral arrangement, with flower arrangements, a portrait of the deceased, and an ihai, a spirit tablet. For privacy reasons, the name of the dead person, as well as the face on the portrait are censored out via pixellation. Held as soon as possible after death, a Japanese wake is called , lit. \\"passing the night\\". All funeral guests wear black: men wear black suits with white shirts and black ties, and women wear either black dresses or black kimonos. If the deceased was an adherent to Buddhism, a set of prayer beads called may be carried by the guests. People attending the wake or funeral offer condolence money to the host/hostess, in special black-and-silver envelopes ( or ). Depending on the relationship to the deceased and the wealth of the guest, the amount may be equivalent to between 3,000 and 30,000 yen. The guests are seated, with immediate relatives seated closest to the front. The Buddhist priest then chants a section from a sutra. The family members will each offer incense three times to the incense urn in front of the deceased. At the same time, the assembled guests will perform the same ritual at another location behind the family members' seats. The wake ends once the priest has completed the sutra. Each departing guest is given a gift, which has a value of about half or one quarter of the condolence money received from this guest. The closest relatives may stay and keep vigil with the deceased overnight in the same room. Funeral The funeral proper, called , is usually on the day after the wake. The procedure is similar to the wake, and incense is offered while a priest chants a sutra. The ceremony differs slightly as the deceased receives a new Buddhist name (ÊàíÂêç, kaimy≈ç; lit. \\"precept name\\") written in Kanji. This name is said to prevent the return of the deceased if their name is called. The length of the name depends also on either the virtue of the person's lifespan or more commonly, the size of the donation of the relatives to the temple, which may range from a generally common name to the most elaborate names for 1 million yen or more. The high prices charged by the temples are a controversial issue in Japan, especially since some temples put pressure on families to buy a more expensive name. The kanji for these kaimy≈ç are usually very ancient, and sometimes with esoteric meanings. At the end of the funeral ceremony, the guests and family may place flowers in the casket around the deceased's head and shoulders before the casket is sealed and carried to the elaborately decorated hearse and transported to the crematorium. In some regions of Japan, the coffin is nailed shut by the mourners using a stone. Cremation Cremation in Japan, illustration from 1867 Picking the bones from the ashes, illustration from 1867Bone-picking ceremony The coffin is placed on a tray in the crematorium. The family witnesses the sliding of the body into the cremation chamber. A cremation usually takes about two hours, and the family returns at a scheduled time when the cremation has been completed. According to the Yamaguchi Saijo Funeral Parlor and Crematorium in Sapporo, it takes about an hour and a half to cremate an adult body, 45 minutes for a child, 15 minutes for a stillborn child. The relatives pick the bones out of the ashes and transfer them to the urn using large chopsticks or metal chopsticks, two relatives sometimes holding the same bone at the same time with their chopsticks (or, according to some sources, passing the bones from chopsticks to chopsticks). Known as , this is the only time in Japan when it is proper for two people to hold the same item at the same time with chopsticks. At all other times, holding anything with chopsticks by two people at the same time, or passing an item from chopsticks to chopsticks, is considered to be a major social faux pas as this will remind bystanders of the funeral of a close relative. The bones of the feet are picked up first, and the bones of the head are picked up last. This is to ensure that the deceased is not upside down in the urn. The hyoid bone, which is located in the neck, is the most significant bone to be placed in the urn. In some cases, the ashes may be divided among more than one urn. For example, some ashes go to a family grave, and some go to the temple or even to a company grave or to a burial in space. Depending upon the local custom, the urn may stay at the family home for a period or may be directly taken to the graveyard. In the Ryukyu Islands, the traditional burial was somewhat different from that in the mainland Japan. Instead of cremation, the body would be temporarily interred in the family tomb (a large burial vault, often of the turtle-back variety); after a few years, once the flesh had decomposed, the bones would be washed and put into the funerary urn, to be permanently stored elsewhere in the tomb. (pp. 170-171). Grave The name of a living spouse written in red A typical Japanese grave is usually a consisting of a stone monument, with a place for flowers, incense, and water in front of the monument and a chamber or crypt underneath for the ashes. A typical Japanese grave The date of the erection of the grave and the name of the person who purchased it may be engraved on the side of the monument. The names of the deceased are often but not always engraved on the front of the monument. When a married person dies before his or her spouse, the name of the spouse may also be engraved on the stone, with the letters painted red. After the death and the burial of the spouse, the red ink is removed from the stone. This is usually done for financial reasons, as it is cheaper to engrave two names at the same time than to engrave the second name when the second spouse dies. It can also be seen as a sign that they are waiting to follow their spouse into the grave. However, this practice is less frequent nowadays. The names of the deceased may also be engraved on the left side, or on a separate stone in front of the grave. Often, the name is also written on a sot≈çba, a separate wooden board on a stand behind or next to the grave. These sot≈çba may be erected shortly after death, and new ones may be added at certain memorial services. Some graves may also have a box for business cards, where friends and relatives visiting the grave can drop their business card, informing the caretakers of the grave of the respects the visitors have paid to the deceased. The high prices of funeral plots, costing on average 2 million yen, have led to a new service of , where a locker-sized grave can be purchased for about 400,000 yen. Some of these may even include a touch screen showing a picture of the deceased, messages, a family tree, and other information. Due to the cost of land, a graveyard in Tokyo has recently been opened by a temple in floors 3 to 8 of a nine-story building, where the lower floors are for funeral ceremonies. There are a number of cases where the ashes of deceased persons have been stolen from graves. The ashes of famous cartoonist Machiko Hasegawa and of the wife of real estate chairman Takichi Hayasaka were stolen for ransom. The ashes of famous novelist Yukio Mishima (1925‚Äì1970) were stolen in 1971 and the ashes of novelist Naoya Shiga were stolen in 1980. The ashes of the wife of the baseball player Sadaharu Oh went missing in December 2002. Mourning and memorial services Memorial services depend on local customs. Usually, there are a number of memorial services following the death - for example, daily for the first seven days, or a number of services within the first 49 days, or on the 7th, 49th and 100th day, depending on the local custom. Most commonly observed are the Buddhist service on the seventh day after death, , and the 49th day, . In many traditions, the urn containing the ashes is interred in a ceremony called on the 49th day, and the family stays in mourning until this. After that, there is a memorial service on the Obon festival in honor of the dead. The festival may be held in the 1st year, sometimes in the 3rd and 5th, 7th and 13th years, and a number of times afterwards up to either the 39th or the 50th year. One popular sequence follows the days of the Thirteen Buddhas. A picture of the deceased is also placed at or near the family altar in the household. Also, in the first year after death, no traditional New Year's Day Postcard is sent or received. The friends and relatives have to be informed of this beforehand so as not to send a card. Japanese funeral industry The average cost of a Japanese funeral is about 2.31 million yen (USD 25,000) according to a 2008 study by the Japan Consumer's Association. This cost includes services such as 401,000 yen for catering to attendants and 549,000 yen for services of the priest. Overall, the industry has a revenue of about 1.5 trillion yen with about 45,000 funeral homes. In 2004, 1.1 million Japanese died (2003: 1.0 million), a number that is expected to rise in the future due to the increase of the average age in Japan; see demographics of Japan. Funeral Business Monthly estimates that there will be 1.7 million deaths by 2035, and revenue of 2 trillion yen in 2040. Recently there have been some changes in the funeral industry, and some funeral homes offer more competitive and transparent pricing than a standard funeral provider. These offer funerals starting at about 200,000 yen, a fraction of the regular overpriced services, and lists the different options and prices to choose from a la carte. Many of these new funeral homes are started by non-Japanese nationals. Also, recently hotels with a decreasing income due to a decrease in weddings have started to offer funeral services. Overall, the level of competition is increasing. To stay competitive, the prices of regular funeral homes are also decreasing over time. Another recent introduction are services where a person can choose his or her funeral service before death and pays a monthly fee (e.g. 10,000 yen) to cover all costs of the funeral. History The Ishibutai Kofun in Asuka, Nara, a partially uncovered Kofun Throughout Japanese history, famous leaders have often been buried in tombs. The oldest known burial chamber was built between 220 and 230 CE in Sakurai, Nara Prefecture, and called the Hokenoyama tomb. The tomb is 80 m long, and the chamber is 7 m long and 2.7 m wide, and contained a coffin 5 m long and 1 m wide. It is not known exactly who is buried there, but it is presumed to be a powerful local leader. Around 300, the use of burial mounds for important leaders became more frequent. Japan developed its unique keyhole-shaped burial mounds, which are called Kofun (Âè§Â¢≥ - the word is used for burial mounds of all shapes), and the period from 250 to 538 is called the Kofun period. Although 50 years ago it was believed that these mounds had initially been influenced by burial mounds in China via the Korean peninsula, Yayoi-period mounds are generally regarded as their predecessors. It is now believed that burial mounds of Korea built in the 5th and 6th centuries may have been influenced by the kofun of Japan.The Hankyoreh 2001.9.6 (in Korean) \\"ÏùºÎ≥∏Ïãù ÎãÆÏùÄ ÏòÅÏÇ∞Í∞ïÍ∞Ä 5~6ÏÑ∏Í∏∞ Í≥†Î∂Ñ\\" (Yeongsan River (ÏòÅÏÇ∞Í∞ï) kofuns were made in 5th and 6th centuries are similar to the Japanese style Kofun) There are numerous burial mounds within the geographical range of ancient Yamato- culture, most of which have keyhole-shaped outlines and which measure up to 400 m. The largest is the tomb of Emperor Nintoku in Sakai near Osaka, with a length of 486 m. and covering an area of 300,000 square meters. They are usually surrounded by moats, unless they are constructed on hills. The round halves of these burial mounds contain burial chambers. In the 6th century, round and square burial mounds came into use. The use of burial mounds is believed to have gradually stopped either with the introduction of Buddhism in Japan in the sixth century AD or with the establishment of the capital in Nara by Empress Genmei in 710. Instead, family tombs were constructed with passages that allow additional burials of relatives. Traditionally, the handling of deceased was considered unclean business and was usually done by Burakumin. Medieval S≈çt≈ç Zen funerals Japanese Buddhist funerals, which make up the vast majority of Japanese funerals today, are generally performed in what was historically the S≈çt≈ç Zen style, although today the S≈çt≈ç funerary rites have come to define the standard funeral format by most of the other Japanese Buddhist schools. Japanese Zen funeral rites came directly from Chinese Chan funeral rites, which were detailed in the Chanyuan Qinggui (Á¶™Èô¢Ê∏ÖË¶è, ‚Äúthe pure regulations of the Zen monastery‚Äù). The major difference between the earlier Chinese Chan funerals and Japanese S≈çt≈ç Zen funerals was that early Japanese monks made no distinction between a monastic funeral for an abbot and the funeral service for a layperson. The first Japanese laypeople to receive Zen funerals were among the ruling elite who sponsored the activities of Zen institutions.William M. Bodiford, \\"Zen in the Art of Funerals: Ritual Salvation in Japanese Buddhism,\\" History of Religions 32, no. 2 (1992): 152. One early example of this is the Regent H≈çj≈ç Tokimune, who received monastic funeral rites in 1284 at the hands of Chinese monk Wuxue Zuyan.Bodiford, \\"Zen in the Art of Funerals,\\" 152. Zen historian Martin Collcutt asserts that ‚Äúone means by which Zen monks extended their influence in society was by the conduct of funeral services for important patrons.‚ÄùMartin Collcutt, Five Mountains: The Rinzai Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981), 73. By the medieval S≈çt≈ç period, only a small percentage of the funeral sermons recorded were delivered for members of the monastic order.William M Bodiford, S≈çt≈ç Zen in Medieval Japan (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1993), 199. The progressive changes in S≈çt≈ç Zen funeral rites were not enacted by its founder, D≈çgen, but came about years later when Zen master Keizan encouraged Zen monks to go out into the countryside and perform funeral services for the laity. Although D≈çgen was the first to implement many aspects of Chinese Chan monastic codes in Japan, his gogoku doesn‚Äôt contain any funeral sermons.Bodiford, Soto Zen in Medieval Japan, 191. At this point in Japanese history, different schools of Zen were in competition for followers, and they were ‚Äúmore conscious than ever before of the necessity of making available to the laity such rites as funeral services and ancestor worship.‚Äù Keizan‚Äôs inclusive attitudes toward funerals resulted in the building of many temples in rural areas and the gradual expansion of the S≈çt≈ç order throughout Japan.Nara, \\"May the Deceased Get Enlightenment!\\", 25. The funeral service that became popular for the Japanese laity in the medieval period was essentially the Chinese Chan service specified for the ordinary monk. The most important phases of this type of Zen funeral were: posthumous ordination, the sermon at the side of the corpse, the circumambulation of the coffin around the cremation ground, and the lighting of the funeral pyre.Bernard Faure, The Rhetoric of Immediacy: A Cultural Critique of Chan/Zen Buddhism (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1991), 193. For a layperson, the posthumous ordination part of the ritual was the most vital, because without ordaining the deceased as a Zen monk, the other funeral rites could not be performed, since Zen funeral rites did not previously exist for laypeople, but only for monks. Once posthumous ordination of the laity was accepted by the S≈çt≈ç school, lay funeral practices became possible; today, death rituals mark the central practice at S≈çt≈ç Zen parish temples.Duncan Ryuken Williams, The Other Side of Zen: A Social History of Soto Zen Buddhism in Tokugawa Japan (Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2005), 38. This practice was one of the first few elements of S≈çt≈ç Zen that was standardized by the early Tokugawa period.Williams, The Other Side of Zen, 41. Since the popularization of S≈çt≈ç Zen in medieval Japan, S≈çt≈ç Zen funeral practices have been a significant point of contact between the monks and laity, and continue to play an important role in lay religious life today. Today Until the early 20th century most bodies were buried and cremation was limited to the wealthy. Cremation became more common after World War II due to its efficiency and cleanliness; in fiscal 2009, 99.9% of Japanese bodies were cremated, and some local governments ban burials. In a break of tradition from the early Edo period to align with modernity, it has been decided that Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko will be cremated after their death instead of ritual burials.

The island's name literally means \\"sandy surface\\" in Chinese. The territory was divided into two concessions given to France and the United Kingdom by the Qing government in the 19th Century (1859 to 1943). The island is a gazetted historical area that serves as a tranquil reminder of the colonial European period, with quiet pedestrian avenues flanked by trees and lined by historical buildings in various states of upkeep. The island is the location of several hotels, a youth hostel, restaurants and tourist shops selling curios and souvenirs. Geography The island covers an area of 0.3 km¬≤, 900 m from east to west, and 300 m from north to south. It is bordered in the south by the Pearl River, and it is separated from the mainland by a canal. History Shamian Island was an important port for Guangzhou's foreign trade from the Song to the Qing Dynasty. From the 18th to the mid 19th century, the foreigners lived and did business in a row of houses known as the Thirteen Factories, on the banks of the Pearl River to the east the present Shamian, which was then an anchorage for thousands of boat people. In 1859, Great Britain and France dug an artificial river (now called Shajichong) to the north, making it an island. Since then, Shamian became a strategic point for city defense during the First and Second Opium Wars. The British captured the Shamian Fort in the Canton River operations in March 1841 during the First Opium War. In the 1847 expedition to Canton, they seized the Shamian batteries along with the rest of the forts guarding the city. In the first armed conflict of the Second Opium War, the British recaptured the forts in 1856. In 1859, the territory was divided in two concessions given to France and the United Kingdom (of which 3/5 belonged to the British and 2/5 to the French). It was connected to the mainland by two bridges, which were closed at 10pm as a security measure. The British arch bridge, also called the \\"Bridge of England\\" and built in 1861, to the north was guarded by Sikh police officers, and the French bridge to the east was guarded by Vietnamese (Cochinchina) recruits with the Troupes coloniales. Trading companies from Britain, the United States, France, Holland, Italy, Germany, Portugal, and Japan built stone mansions along the waterfront. The construction on the island was characterized by climate- adapted but Western-plan detached houses with hipped roofs and large verandahs.Jonathan A. Farris Insular living and its exceptions (.pdf document) The island was the scene of fighting during the \\"June 23 incident\\" in 1925. After 1949, the mansions of Shamian became government offices or apartment houses and the churches were turned into factories. White Swan Hotel A public garden on Shamian Island Features Religious buildings The French Catholic chapel, Our Lady of Lourdes Chapel (), has been restored and stands on the main boulevard. Located at the French end of the island, it was completed in 1892. The British Protestant church, Christ Church Shameen () was built in 1865. Government The community includes the Shamian Police Station ().

Various bronze statues are scattered around the island which depict life as it was during earlier periods on the island, as well as from more recent times. For example, one statue entitled \\"A gentleman, a lady and a darn woman\\" shows a Western couple watching a Chinese woman darning cloth. Another depicts the changing appearances and stature of Chinese women, with a woman from colonial times in traditional clothing, a slightly taller woman from the early or mid 20th century wearing a cheongsam, and a relatively tall and slender young Chinese woman wearing shorts and talking on a mobile phone. Transportation The three east-west streets of the island, formerly named \\"Canal Street\\", \\"Central Avenue\\" (a tree-lined boulevard), and \\"Front Avenue\\" (originally lined on the riverside by parks) were renamed \\"Shamian North Road\\" (Shamian Beijie), \\"Shamian Main Street\\" (Shamian Dajie), and \\"Shamian South Road\\" (Shamian Nanjie). The five north-south streets are named Shamian 1 Street to Shamian 5 Street. Huangsha Station of Guangzhou Metro is located within a short walk from the island, via an overpass crossing the busy Liu'ersan Road. There is also a ferry running from Huangsha Pier to Fangcun Pier, which runs every 10 minutes carrying foot-passengers and bicycles. Fares are from 0.5 RMB for a foot passenger and 1 RMB for a passenger with a bike. There are no public buses on the island itself, although there are several nearby bus stops.

Honn√™tet√© was a mode of restraint and decorum, so practiced that it had become easy and as if natural, shared by aristocrats and fastidious members of the high bourgeoisie, but which could not readily be taught or learned. In contrast with the court, the H√¥tel de Rambouillet received an elite that chose its own members, or, more precisely, whose members recognized one another's right to belong....

The novel is the first book of Grass's ' (Danzig Trilogy). It was adapted into a 1979 film, which won both the Palme d'Or, in the same year, and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film the following year. Plot summary The story revolves around the life of Oskar Matzerath, as narrated by himself when confined in a mental hospital during the years 1952‚Äì1954. Born in 1924 in the Free City of Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland), with an adult's capacity for thought and perception, he decides never to grow up when he hears his father declare that he would become a grocer. Gifted with a piercing shriek that can shatter glass or be used as a weapon, Oskar declares himself to be one of those \\"clairaudient infants\\", whose \\"spiritual development is complete at birth and only needs to affirm itself\\". He retains the stature of a child while living through the beginning of World War II, several love affairs, and the world of postwar Europe. Through all this, a toy tin drum, the first of which he received as a present on his third birthday, followed by many replacement drums each time he wears one out from over-vigorous drumming, remains his treasured possession; he is willing to commit violence to retain it. Oskar considers himself to have two \\"presumptive fathers\\"‚Äîhis mother's husband Alfred Matzerath, a member of the Nazi Party, and her cousin and lover Jan Bronski, a Danzig Pole who is executed for defending the Polish Post Office in Danzig during the German invasion of Poland. Oskar's mother having died, Alfred marries Maria, a woman who is secretly Oskar's first mistress. After marrying Alfred, Maria gives birth to Kurt, whom Oskar thereafter refers to as his son. But Oskar is disappointed to find that the baby persists in growing up, and will not join him in ceasing to grow at the age of three. During the war, Oskar joins a troupe of performing dwarfs who entertain the German troops at the front line. But when his second love, the diminutive Roswitha, is killed by Allied troops in the invasion of Normandy, Oskar returns to his family in Danzig where he becomes the leader of a criminal youth gang (akin to the Edelweiss Pirates). The Russian army soon captures Danzig, and Alfred is shot by invading troops after he goes into seizures while swallowing his party pin to avoid being revealed as a Nazi. Oskar bears some culpability for both of his presumptive fathers' deaths since he leads Joseph Bronski to the Polish Post Office in an effort to get his drum repaired and since he returns Alfred Matzerath's Nazi party pin while the latter is being interrogated by Soviet soldiers. After the war Oskar, his widowed stepmother, and their son have to leave the now Polish city of Danzig and move to D√ºsseldorf, where he models in the nude and works engraving tombstones. Mounting tensions compel Oskar to live apart from Maria and Kurt; he decides on a flat owned by the Zeidlers. Upon moving in, he falls in love with Sister Dorothea, a neighbor, but he later fails to seduce her. During an encounter with fellow musician Klepp, Klepp asks Oskar how he has an authority over the judgement of music. Oskar, willing to prove himself once and for all, picks up his drum and sticks despite his vow to never play again after Alfred's death, and plays a measure on his drum. The ensuing events lead Klepp, Oskar, and Scholle, a guitarist, to form the Rhine River Three jazz band. They are discovered by Mr. Schmuh, who invites them to play at the Onion Cellar club. After a virtuoso performance, a record company talent seeker discovers Oskar the jazz drummer and offers a contract. Oskar soon achieves fame and riches. One day while walking through a field he finds a severed finger: the ring finger of Sister Dorothea, who has been murdered. He then meets and befriends Vittlar. Oskar allows himself to be falsely convicted of the murder and is confined to an insane asylum, where he writes his memoirs. Main characters The novel is divided into three books. The main characters in each book are: Book One: * Oskar Matzerath: Writes his memoirs from 1952 to 1954, age 28 to 30, appearing as a zeitgeist throughout historic milestones. He is the novel's main protagonist and unreliable narrator. * Bruno Munsterberg: Oskar's keeper, who watches him through a peep hole. He makes knot sculptures inspired by Oskar's stories. * Anna Koljaiczek Bronski: Oskar's grandmother, conceives Oscar's mother in 1899, which is when his memoir begins. * Joseph Koljaiczek (\\"Bang Bang Jop\\" or \\"Joe Colchic\\"): Oskar's grandfather, a \\"firebug\\". * Agnes Koljaiczek: Kashubian Oskar's mother. * Jan Bronski: Agnes's cousin and lover. Oskar's presumptive father. Politically sided with the Poles. * Alfred Matzerath: Agnes's husband. Oskar's other presumptive father. Politically sided with the Nazi Party. * Sigismund Markus: A Jewish businessman in Danzig who owns the toy store where Oskar gets his tin drums. The store is ruined during the Danzig Kristallnacht. Book Two: * Maria Truczinski: Girl hired by Alfred to help run his store after Agnes dies and with whom Oskar has his first sexual experience. She becomes pregnant and marries Alfred, but both Alfred and Oskar believe that they are Maria's child's father. She remains Oskar's family throughout the post-war years. * Bebra: Runs the theatrical troupe of dwarfs which Oskar joins to escape Danzig. He is later the paraplegic owner of Oskar's record company. Oskar's lifelong mentor and role model. He is a musical clown. * Roswitha Raguna: Bebra's mistress, then Oskar's. She is a beautiful Italian lady, bit taller than Oskar, she nevertheless chosen not to grow. She is the most celebrated somanambulist in all the parts of Italy. * \\"The Dusters\\": Danzig street urchins gang, Oskar leads as \\"Jesus\\" after he proves his mettle by smashing all the windows with his voice at the abandoned Baltic Chocolate Factory. Book Three: * (Sister) Dorothea: A nurse from D√ºsseldorf and Oskar's love after Maria rejects him. * Egon M√ºnzer (Klepp): Oskar's friend. Self-proclaimed communist and jazz flautist. * Gottfried Vittlar: Becomes friends with and then testifies against Oskar in the Ring Finger Case at Oskar's bidding. Style Oskar Matzerath is an unreliable narrator, as his sanity, or insanity, never becomes clear. He tells the tale in first person, though he occasionally diverts to third person, sometimes within the same sentence. As an unreliable narrator, he may contradict himself within his autobiography, as with his varying accounts of, but not exclusively, the Defense of the Polish Post Office, his grandfather Koljaiczek's fate, his paternal status over Kurt, Maria's son, and many others. The novel is strongly political in nature, although it goes beyond a political novel in the writing's stylistic plurality. There are elements of allegory, myth and legend, placing it in the genre of magic realism. The Tin Drum has religious overtones, both Jewish and Christian. Oskar holds conversations with both Jesus and Satan throughout the book. His gang members call him \\"Jesus\\", then he refers to himself as \\"Satan\\" later in the book. Critical reception Initial reaction to The Tin Drum was mixed. It was called blasphemous and pornographic by some, and legal action was taken against it and Grass. However, by 1965 sentiment had cemented into public acceptance, and it soon became recognized as a classic of post-World War II literature, both in Germany and around the world.Contemporary Literary Criticism.

An adapter or adaptorBoth spellings are used in both British and American English. is a device that converts attributes of one electrical device or system to those of an otherwise incompatible device or system. Some modify power or signal attributes, while others merely adapt the physical form of one connector to another. Travel adapters Many countries with ties to Europe use 230-volt, 50 Hz AC mains electricity, using a variety of power plugs and sockets. Difficulty arises when moving an electrical device between countries that use different sockets. A passive electric power adapter, sometimes called a travel plug or travel adapter, allows using a plug from one region with a foreign socket. As other countries supply 120-volt, 60 Hz AC, using a travel adapter in a country with a different supply poses a safety hazard if the connected device does not support both input voltages. AC-to-DC adapters A \\"power cube\\"-type AC adapter An AC-to-DC power supply adapts electricity from household mains voltage (either 120 or 230 volts AC) to low-voltage DC suitable for powering consumer electronics. Small, detached power supplies for consumer electronics are called AC adapters, or variously power bricks, wall warts, or chargers. Computer adapters A host controller connects a computer to a peripheral device, such as a storage device, network, or human interface device. As a host controller can also be viewed as bridging the protocols used on the buses between peripheral and computer, and internally to the computer, it is also called a host bus adapter. Likewise, specific types may be called adapters: a network interface controller may be called a network adapter, and a graphics card a display adapter. Adapters for external ports Adapters (sometimes called dongles) allow connecting a peripheral device with one plug to a different jack on the computer. They are often used to connect modern devices to a legacy port on an old system, or legacy devices to a modern port. Such adapters may be entirely passive, or contain active circuitry. A common type is a USB adapter. One kind of serial port adapter enables connections between 25-contact and nine-contact connectors, but does not affect electrical power- and signalling-related attributes.

History In the absence of a police force, the clan was the primary force of security in Norse society, as the clansmen were obliged by honour to avenge one another. The Norse clan was not tied to a certain territory in the same way as a Scottish clan, where the chief owned the territory. The land of the Scandinavian clan was owned by the individuals who had close neighbours from other clans. The name of the clan was derived from that of its ancestor, often with the addition of an -ung or -ing ending. The original meaning of √¶tt/√§tt seems to have simply been \\"those who are related\\".^ \\"√Ñtt\\" i Elof Hellquist, Svensk etymologisk ordbok (f√∂rsta upplagan, 1922). A person could technically belong to several clans, but usually the identification of an individual came with ancestry of most prestige. Therefore, through mostly the exception to the rule, a clan could have matrilineal name if the descent of the ancestral mother was considered more important than the father. Family names were not in use, instead patronyms and matronyms were used, likewise depending on the favoured ancestry. Therefore, the clan names reflected the common descent of family groups.Harrison, Dick (2002). Jarlens sekel. Stockholm: Ordfront f√∂rlag. Sid. 100-101. The heavy dependence on family and kindred in early Scandinavian history was the foundation of the importance clan. The Thing served as a moderating force which could prevent blood feuds between the clans due to the importance of kinship. As central government gradually was established in Scandinavia, the √¶tt lost its relevance for commoners. For royalty and nobility, however, it remained in use as the name for line and dynasty.

Proper treatment and placing of the dead has always been of great concern to people around the world. While choice of burial location and treatment of the corpse usually depend on beliefs and ritual standards within a specific cultural context, they are as well of a strategic nature. Burial decisions are affected by cultural norms regarding the deceased‚Äôs age, gender, vertical or horizontal status and by the relationship of people to places and other people. Ideas concerning proper burial also apply to those who have been defunct for quite some time. Dead bodies have been exhumed, reburied and desecrated in order to redefine ‚Äì elevate or degrade ‚Äì the status of their owners, construct new affiliations, rewrite history and to retrieve or construct social memory.Weiss-Krejci, E. (2004). Mortuary representations of the noble house - a cross-cultural comparison between collective tombs of the ancient maya and dynastic europe. Journal of Social Archaeology, 4(3), 368-404. Following the laying to rest of the deceased, who is often surrounded with grave goods, an earthwork called a kurgan in Russian or barrow in English is raised over the house and the structure left sealed. The term has parallels with Christian sepulchres which contain only one burial. Mortuary houses differ from mortuary enclosures in size, design and in the latter's capacity for multiple burials. Origin According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word mortuary derived in the early 14th century, from the word mortuarie, an Anglo-French word meaning \\"gift to a parish priest from a deceased parishioner\\"; from a Medieval Latin word mortuarium, a noun use of neuterof Late Latin adjective mortuarius \\"pertaining to the dead\\", from Latin mortuus, past participle of mori \\"to die\\". The meaning \\"place where bodies are kept temporarily\\" was first recorded in 1865, a euphemism for earlier deadhouse.mortuary. (n.d.). Online Etymology Dictionary.

The group had fewer than 20 members. According to the Global Terrorism Database, Omega 7 was responsible for at least 55 known anti-Castro attacks over the span of eight years with a majority of them being bombs. The group also took part in multiple high-profile murders and assassination attempts and has committed four known fatalities. Among their assassinations was Felix Garcia Rodriguez, a Cuban delegate who was gunned down on the 6th anniversary of the group. The group had conspired to assassinate Fidel Castro during the Cuban leader's visit to the United Nations in 1979. History Eduardo Arocena was born in Cuba on February 26, 1943, and was in school until the start of Castro's regime in 1959. Arocena was a gifted amateur wrestler who had considered taking part in the Olympics. Arocena had been collaborating with other Cuban expatriates and exiles and taking part in activities against Castro that included the destruction of many crucial industrial and agricultural locations. Arocena eventually left to the United States out of fear of his anti-regime actions being exposed. While in the U.S. Arocena resided in New Jersey where he worked in a warehouse and started a family. Dissatisfied with the political opposition to Fidel Castro at the time, during the 1970s Arocena began to recruit Cuban veterans from the Bay Of Pigs Invasion in 1961. In addition to this Arocena would go on to pull members in other anti-Castro exile groups as well, eventually forming his Omega 7 group on September 11, 1974. The New Jersey branch was made up of 7 members (for which the group was named after) including Arocena himself, Jose Juilio Garcia, Pedro Remon, Andres Garcia, Alberto Perez, Eduardo Ochoa, and Eduardo Losada-Fernandez. As the tactical commander of the group, Arocena has stated that the CIA trained him in 1967 in bomb making and a variety of other warfare skills and tactics, although the CIA has never directly confirmed this. Pedro Remon took part in most of Omega 7's attacks and had the duty of calling local radio stations after each assassination or bombing. Most of the other members typically participated in more minor roles within the group. It is believed that the number of members in Omega 7 has never exceeded 20. The group was primarily funded by Cuban businessmen, but received additional funding in the early 1980s from marijuana drug traffickers. Although the group never took part in selling, buying, of narcotics the group did perform collection tasks as well as other assignments given to them by the drug traffickers. There was one narcotics supplier in particular known as Manuel Fernandez that would offer Arocena and the group large quantities of cash in exchange for their services. One of these tasks included an assassination attempt on Luis Fuentes a rival drug dealer to Fernandez. Fernandez eventually went on to testify against Arocena and Omega 7 claiming that they were paid up to $150,000 for their services despite never receiving his collection money from group, he also stated that he had sold two submachine guns to Omega 7. Eduardo Arocena was arrested in Miami on July 22, 1983, Omega 7 became inactive shortly after his arrest. Indictment of Eduardo Arocena On September 22, 1984 Eduardo Arocena was convicted on 26 charges which included murder and bombings, many of which Arocena confessed to prior to his conviction. Arocena was ruled to serve a mandatory life sentence. During Eduardo Arocena's trial, he claimed to have been taken to the FBI offices in New York City where he accused the Bureau of drugging him to the point of unconsciousness to which he found needle marks in his arms when he awoke. According to Arocena, the FBI had tried to coerce him into speaking about a variety of terrorist groups and operations. This story has never been confirmed by the F.B.I. When Eduardo Arocena was put on trial he initially denied being the leader of Omega 7, claiming that he was simply \\"obsessed with Communism\\" and had worked alongside the C.I.A. in Cuba in order to look into communist activities in Cuba. Arocena also denied ever taking part in terrorist actives in the United States, but did state that he was trained in the use of explosives by the C.I.A. in Florida. Arocena also stated that he once traveled Cuba, and releasing \\"germs\\" in the environment in order to start a chemical war between Cuba and the United States. In 2008 Arocena's wife Miriam led a campaign, which petitioned for the release of her husband. Miriam suggested that the life sentence her husband received was unwarranted given the nature and patriotic reasons of Eduardo Arocena's actions. Known attacks On February 1, 1975 the group bombed the Venezuelan consulate in New York City Arocena confessed to putting a hit out on Eulalio Jose Negrin who had negotiated with Cuba about the release of political prisoners. Arocena did not approve of any diplomatic negotiations with Cuba and therefore ordered Remon to kill Negrin. Remon completed the hit by murdering Negrin with a submachine gun in front of Negrin's teenage son. On September 11, 1980, an attach√© with the Cuban Permanent Mission to the United Nations, Felix Garcia Rodriguez, was fatally shot. He was driving back to the Cuban Mission along the Queens Boulevard service road near 58th Street in Queens, and was killed by a bullet fired from a parked car. Garcia was \\"the first United Nations official to have been assassinated in New York City since the founding of the world organization\\" in 1945. \\"Cuban Attach√© at U.N.

The primary arteries (the aorta and the pulmonary artery) are transposed. It is called a cyanotic congenital heart defect (CHD) because the newborn infant turns blue from lack of oxygen. In segmental analysis, this condition is described as ventriculoarterial discordance with atrioventricular concordance, or just ventriculoarterial discordance. d-TGA is often referred to simply as transposition of the great arteries (TGA); however, TGA is a more general term which may also refer to levo-transposition of the great arteries (l-TGA).Another term commonly used to refer to both d-TGA and l-TGA is transposition of the great vessels (TGV), although this term might have an even broader meaning than TGA. Prenatally, a baby with d-TGA experiences no symptoms as the lungs will not be used until after birth, and oxygen is provided by the mother via the placenta and umbilical cord; in order for the red blood to bypass the lungs in utero, the fetal heart has two shunts that begin to close when the newborn starts breathing; these are the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus. The foramen ovale is a hole in the atrial septum which allows blood from the right atrium to flow into the left atrium; after birth, the left atrium will be filled with blood returning from the lungs and the foramen ovale will close. The ductus arteriosus is a small, artery-like structure which allows blood to flow from the trunk of the pulmonary artery into the aorta; after birth, the blood in the pulmonary artery will flow into the lungs and the ductus arteriosus will close. Sometimes these shunts will fail to close after birth; these defects are called patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus, and either may occur independently, or in combination with one another, or with d-TGA or other heart and/or general defects. Symptoms and signs cyanotic d-TGA + VSD neonate (unpalliated and pre-operative). Due to the low oxygen saturation of the blood, cyanosis will appear in peripheral areas: around the mouth and lips, fingertips, and toes; these areas are furthest from the heart, and since the circulated blood is not fully oxygenated to begin with, very little oxygen reaches the peripheral arteries. A d-TGA baby will exhibit indrawing beneath the ribcage and \\"comfortable tachypnea\\" (rapid breathing); this is likely a homeostatic reflex of the autonomic nervous system in response to hypoxic hypoxia. The infant will be easily fatigued and may experience weakness, particularly during feeding or playing; this interruption to feeding combined with hypoxia can cause failure to thrive. If d-TGA is not diagnosed and corrected early on, the infant may eventually experience syncopic episodes and develop clubbing of the fingers and toes. Diagnosis d-TGA can sometimes be diagnosed in utero with an ultrasound after 18 weeks gestation. However, if it is not diagnosed in utero, cyanosis of the newborn (blue baby) should immediately indicate that there is a problem with the cardiovascular system. Normally, the lungs are examined first, then the heart is examined if there are no apparent problems with the lungs. These examinations are typically performed using ultrasound, known as an echocardiogram when performed on the heart. Chest x-rays and electrocardiograms (EKG) may also be used in reaching or confirming a diagnosis; however, an x-ray may appear normal immediately following birth. If d-TGA is accompanied by both a VSD and pulmonary stenosis, a systolic murmur will be present. On the rare occasion (when there is a large VSD with no significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction), initial symptoms may go unnoticed, resulting in the infant being discharged without treatment in the event of a hospital or birthing center birth, or a delay in bringing the infant for diagnosis in the event of a home birth. On these occasions, a layperson is likely not to recognize symptoms until the infant is experiencing moderate to serious congestive heart failure (CHF) as a result of the heart working harder in a futile attempt to increase oxygen flow to the body; this overworking of the heart muscle eventually leads to hypertrophy and may result in cardiac arrest if left untreated. Normal heart anatomy compared to d-TGA Description In a normal heart, oxygen-depleted (\\"blue\\") blood is pumped from the right side of the heart, through the pulmonary artery, to the lungs where it is oxygenated. The oxygen-rich (\\"red\\") blood then returns to the left heart, via the pulmonary veins, and is pumped through the aorta to the rest of the body, including the heart muscle itself. With d-TGA, deoxygenated blood from the right heart is pumped immediately through the aorta and circulated to the body and the heart itself, bypassing the lungs altogether, while the left heart pumps oxygenated blood continuously back into the lungs through the pulmonary artery. In effect, two separate \\"circular\\" (parallel) circulatory systems are created, rather than the \\"figure 8\\" (in series) circulation of a normal cardio-pulmonary system. Variations and similar defects =Arterial spatial relationships= Differences in the shape of the atrial septum and/or ventricular outflow tracts affect the relative positions of the aorta and pulmonary artery. In the majority of d-TGA cases, the aorta is anterior and to the right of the pulmonary artery, but it can also be directly anterior or anterior and to the left. The aorta and pulmonary artery can also be side by side, with aorta on either side. This is a less common variant, and with this arrangement, an unusual coronary artery pattern is common. There are also some cases with aorta to the right and posterior to the pulmonary artery.Valdes-Cruz LM and Cayre RO: Chapter 24 in Echocardiographic diagnosis of congenital heart disease. Philadelphia 1998. =Simple and complex d-TGA= d-TGA is often accompanied by other heart defects, the most common type being intracardiac shunts such as atrial septal defect (ASD) including patent foramen ovale (PFO), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Stenosis of valves or vessels may also be present. When no other heart defects are present it is called 'simple' d-TGA; when other defects are present it is called 'complex' d-TGA. Although it may seem counterintuitive, complex d-TGA presents better chance of survival and less developmental risks than simple d-TGA, as well as usually requiring fewer invasive palliative procedures. This is because the left-to-right and bidirectional shunting caused by the defects common to complex d-TGA allow a higher amount of oxygen-rich blood to enter the systemic circulation. However, complex d-TGA may cause a very slight increase to length and risk of the corrective surgery, as most or all other heart defects will normally be repaired at the same time, and the heart becomes \\"irritated\\" the more it is manipulated. Treatment If the diagnosis is made in a standard hospital or other clinical facility, the baby will be transferred to a children's hospital, if such facilities are available, for specialized paediatric treatment and equipment. The patient will require constant monitoring and care in an intensive care unit (ICU). Palliative Palliative treatment is normally administered prior to corrective surgery in order to reduce the symptoms of d-TGA (and any other complications), giving the newborn or infant a better chance of surviving the surgery. Treatment may include any combination of: =Surgery= Minor *Cardiac catheterization **Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy **Balloon angioplasty **Endovascular stenting **Angiography Cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure which provides a means of performing a number of other procedures. A balloon atrial septostomy is performed with a balloon catheter, which is inserted into a patent foramen ovale ( PFO ), or atrial septal defect ( ASD ) and inflated to enlarge the opening in the atrial septum; this creates a shunt which allows a larger amount of oxygenated (\\"red\\") blood to enter the systemic circulation. Angioplasty also requires a balloon catheter, which is used to stretch open a stenotic vessel; this relieves restricted blood flow, which could otherwise lead to congestive heart failure (CHF). An endovascular stent is sometimes placed in a stenotic vessel immediately following a balloon angioplasty to maintain the widened passage. Angiography involves using the catheter to release a contrast medium into the chambers and/or vessels of the heart; this process facilitates examining the flow of blood through the chambers during an echocardiogram, or shows the vessels clearly on a chest x-ray, MRI, or CT scan - this is of particular importance, as the coronary arteries must be carefully examined and \\"mapped out\\" prior to the corrective surgery. It is commonplace for any of these palliations to be performed on a d-TGA patient. Moderate *Left anterior thoracotomy **Isolated pulmonary artery banding (PAB) *Left lateral thoracotomy **PAB (when coarctation or aortic arch repair also required) *Right lateral thoracotomy **Blalock-Hanlon atrial septectomy Each of these procedures is performed through an incision between the ribs and visualized by echocardiogram; these are far less common than heart cath procedures. Pulmonary artery banding is used in a small number of cases of d-TGA, usually when the corrective surgery needs to be delayed, to create an artificial stenosis in order to control pulmonary blood pressure; PAB involves placing a band around the pulmonary trunk, this band can then be quickly and easily adjusted when necessary. An atrial septectomy is the surgical removal of the atrial septum; this is performed when a patent foramen ovale ( PFO ), or atrial septal defect ( ASD ) are not present and additional shunting is required to raise the oxygen saturation of the blood flowing eventually into the aorta. Major *Median sternotomy **PAB (when intracardiac procedures also required) **Concomitant atrial septectomy In recent years, it is quite rare for palliative procedures to be done via median sternotomy. However, if a sternotomy is required for a different procedure, in most cases all procedures that are immediately required will be performed at the same time. =Monitoring and maintenance= Palliated pre-operative d-TGA + VSD neonate. *Nasogastric tube (NG tube or simply NG) *Intubation, oxygen mask, or nasal cannula *Intravenous drip (IV) *Arterial line *Central venous catheter *Fingerprick *Sphygmomanometer *Pulse oximeter *EKG An NG tube is used to deliver nourishment, and occasionally medication, to the patient. Since the tube extends right into the stomach, it can also be used to monitor how well the patient is digesting their \\"food\\". Paediatric units normally provide facilities and equipment for mothers of infant patients to pump their breastmilk, which can then be fed to the infant through the NG tube, and/or stored for later use. Oxygen therapy is commonplace for hospitalized d-TGA patients. This may range from an oxygen mask resting on the bed nearby their head to intubation. In some cases, patients are intubated as a precaution; the machine can monitor breathing and supplement the patient as much or as little as they need. IV's are used to deliver medication, blood products, or other fluids to the patient. Arterial lines provide a constant monitor of blood pressure, as well as a method of obtaining samples for blood gas tests; central lines can also monitor blood pressure and provide blood samples, as well as provide a means to deliver medication and nourishment; fingerpricks (or heelpricks on small babies) are used to obtain blood samples for certain tests. A sphygmomanometer may be used for intermittent blood pressure monitoring even if a patient is being otherwise monitored using a central or arterial line. A pulse oximeter is attached to a finger or toe and provides constant or intermittent monitoring of the blood's oxygen saturation level. An EKG creates a visual readout of how well the heart rhythm is functioning. =Medication= *Prostaglandin (PGE) *Antibiotics *Diuretics *Analgesics *Cardiac glycosides *Sedatives When PGE is administered to a newborn, it prevents the ductus arteriosus from closing, therefore providing an additional shunt through which to provide the systemic circulation with a higher level of oxygen. Antibiotics may be administered preventatively. However, due to the physical strain caused by uncorrected d-TGA, as well as the potential for introduction of bacteria via arterial and central lines, infection is not uncommon in pre-operative patients. Diuretics aid in flushing excess fluid from the body, thereby easing strain on the heart. Analgesics normally are not used pre-operatively, but they may be used in certain cases. They are occasionally used partially for their sedative effects. Cardiac glycosides are used to maintain proper heart rhythm while increasing the strength of each contraction. Sedatives may be used palliatively to prevent a young child from thrashing about or pulling out any of their lines. Corrective =Nikaidoh= It was Bex who introduced in 1980 the possibility of aortic translocation. But Nikaidoh has put the procedure in practice in 1984. It results in an anatomical normal heart, even better than with an ASO, because also the cones are switched instead of only the arteries as with an ASO. The procedure is contra-indicated by certain coronary anomalies. In 1984, Nikaidoh introduced a surgical approach for the management of TGA, VSD, and pulmonary stenosis (PS), which he called ‚Äúaortic translocation and biventricular outflow tract reconstruction.‚Äù The repair consisted of harvesting the aortic root from the right ventricle, with or without the coronary arteries attached, and relieving the LVOTO by dividing the outlet septum and pulmonary valve annulus. The LVOT is then restored by posteriorly translocating the aortic root and closing the VSD. Finally, the right ventricular outflow tract is reconstructed with a pericardial patch. This is a technically challenging procedure, but results in a more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù anatomic repair. The main thing is the repositioning of the native aortic root over to the LV cavity, avoiding the creation of a long tortuous intraventricular tunnel. This technique appears to prevent the development of LVOTO, which is a frequent complication of the Rastelli repair. The addition of the Lecompte maneuver may prevent branch pulmonary artery stenosis that may occur secondary to compression of the PA by the posteriorly displaced, translocated aortic root. It creates a direct RV to PA anastomosis and avoiding the use of a conduit, which should decrease the incidence of RVOT reinterventions. =Lecompte= Since 1981 LeCompte has put his LeCompte manoeuvre in use. This is used with the REV (R√©paration √† l'Etage Ventriculaire). This surgery is like the Rastelli procedure, but with the use of the pulmonary artery without a conduit. =Rastelli= When an arterials switch operation (ASO) is not possible e.g. in case of LVOTO an option is the Rastelli procedure. The pulmonal artery is shifted with help of conduit to the right ventricle. It has been used since 1960s. It has a disadvantage that the conduit does not grow, so re-operation is necessary. =Arterial switch= Arterial switch procedure. Immediate post-operative (Jatene procedure) d-TGA + VSD neonate. The Jatene procedure surgery is the preferred, and most frequently used, method of correcting d-TGA; ideally, it is performed on an infant between 8‚Äì14 days old. The heart and vessels are accessed via median sternotomy, and a cardiopulmonary bypass machine is used; as this machine needs its \\"circulation\\" to be filled with blood, a child will require a blood transfusion for this surgery. The procedure involves transecting both the aorta and pulmonary artery; the coronary arteries are then detached from the aorta and reattached to the neo-aorta, before \\"swapping\\" the upper portion of the aorta and pulmonary artery to the opposite arterial root. Including the anaesthesia and immediate post operative recovery, this surgery takes an average of approximately six to eight hours to complete. Some arterial switch recipients may present with post-operative pulmonary stenosis, which would then be repaired with angioplasty, pulmonary stenting via heart cath or median sternotomy, and/or xenograft. One day post- operative (Jatene procedure) d-TGA + VSD neonate. =Atrial switch= In some cases, it is not possible to perform an arterial switch, either because of late diagnosis, sepsis, or a contraindicative coronary artery pattern. In the case of sepsis or late diagnosis, a delayed Arterial Switch can sometimes be made possible by PAB, which may also require a concomitant construction of an aortic-to-pulmonary artery shunt. When an arterial switch is impossible, an atrial switch will be attempted using either the Senning or Mustard procedure. Both methods involve creating a baffle to redirect red and blue blood flow to the appropriate artery. Since the late 1970s the Mustard procedure has been preferred. Post-operative Following corrective surgery but prior to cessation of anaesthesia, two small incisions are made immediately below the sternotomy incision which provide exit points for chest tubes used to drain fluid from the thoracic cavity, with one tube placed at the front and another at the rear of the heart. The patient returns to the ICU post-operatively for recovery, maintenance, and close observation; recovery time may vary, but tends to average approximately two weeks, after which the patient may be transferred to a Transitional Care Unit (TCU), and eventually to a cardiac ward. Post-operative care is very similar to the palliative care received, with the exception that the patient no longer requires PGE or the surgical palliation procedures. Additionally, the patient is kept on a cooling blanket for a period of time to prevent fever, which could cause brain damage. The sternum is not closed immediately which allows extra space in the thoracic cavity, preventing excess pressure on the heart, which swells considerably following the surgery; the sternum and incision are closed after a few days, when swelling is sufficiently reduced. Follow-up The infant will continue to see a cardiologist on a regular basis. Although these appointments are required less frequently as time goes on, they will continue throughout the lifetime of the individual, and may increase in the event of complications or as the individual approaches middle age. The cardiology exam may include an echocardiogram, EKG, and/or cardiac stress test in addition to consultation. Additionally, some individuals may require ongoing medication therapy at home, which may include diuretics (such as furosemide or spironolactone), analgesics (such as paracetamol), cardiac glycosides (such as digoxin), anticoagulants (such as heparin or aspirin), or other medications. If the individual has undergone stenting, an anticoagulant will be a necessity to prevent build-up around the stent(s), as the body will perceive the foreign body as a wound and attempt to heal it. Some patients who had alternate corrective surgery, such as the Mustard or Senning procedure, may have issues with SA and VA nodal transmissions in later life. Typical symptoms include palpitations and problems with low heart rates. This is commonly solved with a Pacemaker unit, providing scar tissue from the original operation does not block its functionality. More recently, ACE inhibitors have been prescribed to patients in the hope of relieving stress on the heart. Prognosis With simple d-TGA, if the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus are allowed to close naturally, the newborn will likely not survive long enough to receive corrective surgery. With complex d-TGA, the infant will fail to thrive and is unlikely to survive longer than a year if corrective surgery is not performed. In most cases, the patient's condition will deteriorate to the point of inoperability if the defect is not corrected in the first year. While the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus are open after birth, some mixing of red and blue blood occurs allowing a small amount of oxygen to be delivered to the body; if ASD, VSD, PFO, and/or PDA are present, this will allow a higher amount of the red and blue blood to be mixed, therefore delivering more oxygen to the body, but can complicate and lengthen the corrective surgery and/or be symptomatic. Modern repair procedures within the ideal timeframe and without additional complications have a very high success rate.

It is the world‚Äòs largest manufacturer of fiberglass composites. https://www.cleverism.com/company/owens-corning/ It was formed in 1935 as a partnership between two major American glassworks, Corning Glass Works and Owens-Illinois. The company employs approximately 19,000 people around the world. Owens Corning has been a Fortune 500 company every year since the list was created in 1955. The Pink Panther appears in most of the company‚Äôs advertisements.  History   1935-1980  Fiberglass production in 1942 Owens-Corning Fiberglass Company was formed in 1935 through the merger of Owens-Illinois and Corning Glass Works. It became a separate company in 1938 with its headquarters established in Toledo, Ohio. In 1938, the company sales reached $2.6 million. The company held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 1952. In 1955, Owens-Corning purchased land for a research and testing facility near Granville, Ohio. Also in 1955, Owens- Corning made the first Fortune 500 company list. The company has been on the Fortune 500 list every year since its creation. In 1965, Owens-Corning Fiberglas Europe was formed. In 1966, Owens-Corning established a partnership with Armstrong Rubber Co. to produce fiberglass-reinforced automobile tires. By 1971, Owens-Corning's annual revenue was over $500 million. In 1974, the company opened a temporary plant to produce insulation for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. In 1977, Owens-Corning acquired Frye Roofing and began production of fiberglass mat to replace traditional paper mat used in roofing. Owens-Corning sales surpassed $1 billion in 1976, and sales were over $2 billion by 1979. In 1978, two shipyard workers filed a class action lawsuit against which alleged that Owens-Corning and 14 other manufacturers had known about asbestos-containing products.  1981-present  Owens Corning Headquarters In 1985, Owens-Corning acquired Aerospace and Strategic Metals Group in Newport Beach, California for $415 million from Armco Inc. The color PINK was trademarked through Owens-Corning in 1986, making it the first company to trademark a color. By 1990, Owens-Corning was the defendant in about 84,500 asbestos-related lawsuits. The company opened an Asia/Pacific division in 1993. In May 1994, Owens-Corning acquired UC Industries, which produced Foamular polystyrene insulation, as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1996, the company changed its name to Owens Corning. In May 1997, Owens Corning acquired Fibreboard Corporation, a vinyl siding and other industrial material manufacturer, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Owens Corning. The company was ordered to pay $5 million to an asbestos victim in 1997, making it the highest jury verdict in the history of the United States for a single non-malignant asbestos case. In 1999, a jury in federal district court in Florida awarded $1.8 million compensatory damages and $31 million punitive damages against the company for asbestos products. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2000. In 2002, Owens Corning removed its shares from the New York Stock Exchange. In 2006, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange again under ticker \\"OC.\\" In 2007, Owens Corning announced a joint venture with Saint-Gobain named OCV Reinforcements. Owens Corning partnered with DuPont in 2011 to create a steel and foam energy reduction (SAFER) barrier around auto racetracks. In July 2015, the company announced it would be moving a manufacturing center for mineral wool insulation into an empty plant west of Joplin, Missouri.  Products  In 1939, the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships made Owens-Corning insulation standard in new warship construction. Warship insulation, called Navy Board, was a permanent form- board insulation covered with woven continuous fiber cloth. Owens-Corning produced a prototype boat hull constructed of fiber glass-reinforced plastic in 1944. In 1945, the company worked with an automaker to produce the first fiberglass-reinforced plastic car body. In 1953, General Motors used this type of body in the Chevrolet Corvette. In 1954, the company invented a process to make centrifugally-spun fiberglass wool, which became the standard process for producing fiberglass insulation. In 1955, Owens-Corning introduced its Perma- Ply roofing material for built-up room insulation covering. The company created its first all fiber (AF) fiberglass wool in 1956. To distinguish its product, the company dyed their insulation pink by adding red dye to the AF wool. However, considering that the coloring made the insulation look pink, the company was concerned that the color would discourage the predominate male-oriented market for the material. As such, they decided to withdraw the coloring from its insulation, only to receive customer requests for the coloring to be restored. The company resumed the coloring in the face of such customer interest to the point of licensing the United Artists cartoon character, the Pink Panther, in 1979 as its mascot for the product. Furthermore, the coloring became an official company trademark in court 1987, which became first time a color was used for that purpose. After the January 27, 1967, Apollo 1 fire which killed three astronauts, NASA worked with Owens- Corning and Du Pont to develop beta cloth, a fireproof cloth of woven fiberglass coated with Teflon, as a replacement for the nylon outer layer of the Apollo/Skylab A7L space suit.Space.com: Everyday Tech From Space: Fiberglass Fibers for Fabric RoofsExtreme Textiles: Designing for High PerformanceCrew Patch reference guide In February 2017, Owens Corning received the Asthma and Allergy Friendly certification for its Pure Safety‚Ñ¢ high- performance insulation. ‚ÄúOwens Corning now joins a select group of manufacturers that are focused on product innovation to address people‚Äôs exposure to allergens and irritants in their homes,‚Äù said Julian Francis, president of insulation, Owens Corning.

(WV23) A chamber tomb is a tomb for burial used in many different cultures. In the case of individual burials, the chamber is thought to signify a higher status for the interree than a simple grave. Built from rock or sometimes wood, the chambers could also serve as places for storage of the dead from one family or social group and were often used over long periods for multiple burials. Most chamber tombs were constructed from large stones or megaliths and covered by cairns, barrows or earth. Some chamber tombs are rock-cut monuments or wooden-chambered tombs covered with earth barrows. Grave goods are a common characteristic of chamber tomb burials. In Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe, stone-built examples of these burials are known by the generic term of megalithic tombs. Chamber tombs are often distinguished by the layout of their chambers and entrances or the shape and material of the structure that covered them, either an earth barrow or stone cairn.

His name and title in full was \\"His majesty Amir al-Mumenin al-Mutawakkil 'Ala Allah Rab ul- Alamin Imam Yahya bin al-Mansur Bi'llah Muhammad Hamidaddin, Imam and Commander of the Faithful\\" (the prince of the believers, he who relies on God, the Lord of the Universe). Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din was born on Friday 18 June 1869 in Sanaa into the Hamidaddin branch of the al-Qasimi dynasty who ruled most of Yemen proper and South Saudi Arabia today for over 900 years. Upon the death of his father in 1904, Yahya became Imam, effectively ruler over the mountainous areas of the future North Yemen. However, the Ottomans who made claim on the area did not recognize the rule of the Imams of Yemen since their entry into Yemen. Impressions Sir Gilbert Clayton, who visited King Yahya in Sana'a in an earnest attempt to win him over in 1925 and during his short stay in the capital, was impressed by this ruler's administration, his military preparedness, and organization. Lt Col. Harold Jacob, C.S.I. describing him said; \\"Imam Yahya is a strong ruler. His sanctity as High Priest of the Zaidi sect and his descent from the Prophet's family adds to the prestige which his benign rule has won. His methods are patriarchal and humane. His one hobby is the Yemen\\" Jewish chronicles lavish praise upon him and depict him as the champion of justice and compassion.Shalom 'Uzayri, Galei-Or, Tel-Aviv 1974 (Hebrew) This is, however, not surprising. Imam Yahia managed to put an end to the state of anarchy, lawlessness and violence which had lacerated the country and inflicted immense suffering upon its inhabitants, including the Jews. During his long reign the Jews enjoyed relatively favorable conditions and were generally in favour of the Imam.Parfitt, Tudor (2000) 'The Jewish Image of the Imam: Paradox or Paradigm?' In: Parfitt, Tudor, (ed.), Israel and Ishmael: Studies in Muslim- Jewish relations. London: Curzon-SOAS Near and Middle East Publications, pp. 207‚Äì225. The residence of Imam Yahya in the Wadi Dhar near Sana'a World War I In 1911 Imam Yahya signed the Treaty of Daan with the Ottomans which recognised his rule over the Zaydi-controlled portions of Yemen.Robert Burrowes, Historical Dictionary of Yemen (Lanham: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1995), xxvi. News of the demise of the Ottoman Empire reached Yemen on Thursday 14 November 1918. Imam Yahya went to Sana'a three days later on Sunday 17 November 1918 to meet with tribal leaders from Hashid, Arhab, Nihm, and Khowlan. He arrived at the residence of the judge and scholar Hussein bin Ali Al Amri and received dignitaries, scholars, Turkish princes, judges, and a flood of subjects who proclaimed him the supreme ruler of all of Yemen. His first order was to forbid entering the capital Sana'a with arms, and appointed sentries at the gates to start a reign of peace and justice unparalleled during the years of his rule. City after city accepted the rule and authority of Imam Yahya; the port of Mocha, and the city of Taiz were among the first most important cities. He took steps to create a modern state, and maintained all Ottoman officials who would stay to support the development of government. He created a regular army in 1919 that enlisted soldiers from the surrounding tribes to Sana'a; from the tribes of Sanhan, Bani Harthi, and Bani Hushaish. He signed many treaties which recognised Yemen as a sovereign state, the first of which was the Italo-Yemeni Treaty in 1926. Due to conflicting tribes in the border areas between Saudi Arabia and Yemen that escalated into a war ensued that was ended in 1934 with the signing of the Taif Treaty between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The treaty was the basis for the final territorial agreement between both countries concluded during the reign of King Fahd bin Abdulaziz and President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Internal policy From 1934 until his assassination in 1948, Yahya redirected his energies toward internal consolidation of his authority and the creation of a viable central government, answerable to him personally. To this end, control of the hinterland was strengthened by the establishment of a standing army and the naming of his sons as governors of key provinces. Tighter control over affairs in San'a, the capital, was assured by expanding the scope of administrative functions and appointing other sons as supervisors of old and new political institutions . The regime sent Yemen's first students abroad : military cadets to Iraq in the 1930s and civilian students, the \\"Famous Forty,\\" to Lebanon in the late 1940s.see An early attempt was made to introduce some direction to the nascent national economy by the establishment of a Yemen trading company.Legitimacy and political change in Yemen and Oman, J. E. Peterson Even with these changes, Yahya's Yemen was a semi-feudal state in which even the most basic measures required his personal approval. Relations with his Jewish subjects Imam Yahya was largely admired by the Jews of Yemen, who saw him as their patron and protector.Bat-Zion Eraqi Korman, \\"Yemeni Jews En Route to Palestine by Way of Aden during the Mandate Period 1920‚Äì1948\\", in: Ascending the Palm Tree ‚Äì An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage, Rachel Yedid & Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 309 Earlier, in 1906, the Jews of Sana'a had come out in full-force to welcome the Imam who returned to the city after the Turks had temporarily left it. However, by 1922, in response to outside pressure, Imam Yahya promulgated an edict that prohibited Yemeni Jewish emigration. Although the ban on emigration remained the official policy of the state until 1949, Jews were able to bypass its policy by secretly going into the British Protectorate of Aden. Throughout the early 1940s, Imam Yahya turned a blind eye to Jewish emigration, neither prohibiting it nor officially permitting it, but rather giving his unspoken consent to the departure of Jews from Sana'a and other central Yemeni settlements.Bat-Zion Eraqi Korman, \\"Yemeni Jews En Route to Palestine by Way of Aden during the Mandate Period 1920‚Äì1948\\", in: Ascending the Palm Tree ‚Äì An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage, Rachel Yedid & Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, pp. 310‚Äì313 During the Imam's reign, he reinforced an old edict prohibiting Jews from building their houses higher than Muslim houses.; as early as 1761, Yemeni Imam el-Mahdi el-Abbas (1748‚Äì1775) ordered that the Jews in Sana'a lower their houses to a maximum height of 14 cubits (nine metres) The Imam appointed Yihya Yitzhak Halevi as one of four representatives of the Jewish community, responsible for conveying matters of state to his community and collecting the annual Poll-tax, a position which he held until his death.Shalom Gamliel, The Jews and the King in the Yemen, vol. 1-2, pp. 19-20, Jerusalem 1986 (Hebrew) After the Imam's assassination in 1948, the king's emigration policy continued under his son Ahmad. Assassination During a short excursion outside of the periphery of Sana'a on 17 February 1948, the Imam's limousine was ambushed by an assassin, during which the Imam Yahya and his grandson were shot and killed, in what became known as the Alwaziri coup. The assassin, known as Al-Qardaei, was from the Bani Murad tribe. Upon the knowledge of the murder of Imam Yahya, Yemeni tribes rallied behind Sayf-ul-Islam Ahmad bin Yahya and accepted him as the new Imam of Yemen. The armies surrounded Sanaa under the leadership of Seif Ul Islam Alhassan and Seif Ul Islam Alabbass, both sons of the late Imam, supported by their brother Seif Ul Islam Yahya from within the city walls. The news shocked both the Arab League, and all Muslim governments. King Abdullah of Jordan compared his death to that of the third Caliph Uthman. Both King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, and himself supported Imam Ahmad, and were first to declare him as the new Head of State. Yemen was a founding member of the Arab League in 1945, and later joined the United Nations in 1947. In 1946 British opposition to Imam Yahya was led from Aden-based political parties.

Cunnington was a self-educated merchant, who developed an interest in the rich archaeological landscape around the Wiltshire village of Heytesbury where he lived and worked. In contrast to the vast majority of antiquarians of the time, Cunnington realised that to fully understand the barrows which fascinated him, they should be excavated and recorded carefully and methodically. Beginning his work around 1798, the initial investigations were self-funded, but increasingly they attracted the interest of a succession of wealthy patrons including H.P. Wyndham MP (whose sister Laetitia lived at Heytesbury House) and culminating in Sir Richard Colt Hoare (1758‚Äì1838) of Stourhead. Hoare's substantial financial investment in Cunnington's work from 1804, and the consequent increase in the number of excavations undertaken, enabled the latter to excavate several hundred barrows across south Wiltshire. By modern standards, Cunnington's excavation methodology ‚Äì predominantly involving a shaft trench dug from the crown of a barrow to ground level in search of \\"novelties\\" ‚Äì was poor, but he was the first archaeologist to undertake such an extensive campaign of work and was a true pioneer. It was not until the work of Thomas Bateman (1821‚Äì61) in Derbyshire in the 1840s, that large scale excavations saw a significant step forward in methodology. Stephen and John Parker, also of Heytesbury, worked on nearly all of Cunnington's excavations up to 1810Everill, P. 2010. The Parkers of Heytesbury: Archaeological pioneers. Antiquaries Journal 90: 441-53 and were held in some esteem as reliable, careful and experienced excavators. John Parker is more frequently discussed in correspondence between Cunnington and Hoare and it is clear that he was often despatched on travels across the Wiltshire Downs in search of new sites. John, born in 1780, is portrayed with some warmth by Cunnington and he comes across as hard-working and enthusiastic, being deeply disappointed by the failure of excavations to produce interesting material. Recent research by Paul Everill has revealed the first reference to the use of a trowel on an archaeological site in a letter from Cunnington to Hoare in 1808, which describes John Parker using one in the excavation of Bush Barrow.Everill, P. 2009. Invisible Pioneers. British Archaeology 108: 40-43 Along with Richard Colt Hoare, Cunnington was the subject of an exhibition at the Wiltshire Museum in 2003. The museum holds the archives made by Cunnington, along with watercolour drawings made by Philip Crocker and the objects that he excavated.

In it, a multitude of alien civilizations that have previously interacted with Earth join forces to prevent humans from interfering further with galactic affairs. To accomplish this, they designate Earth as a penal colony. The miniseries and its crossover in the pages of Avengers were written by Kurt Busiek. Marvel collected half of the story arc in trade paperback on November 24, 2010.Avengers / X-MEN: Maximum Security at Amazon.com, accessed January 11, 2011. Publication history In December 2000, Marvel Comics published Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet, which recapped relevant events and set up the crossover's main plot. All three issues of Maximum Security were published in January 2001. Most other comics from the publisher that month tied into the event, if only marginally. While not carrying the \\"Maximum Security\\" banner, plotlines from the earlier miniseries Avengers Forever (1999) and Avengers Infinity (2000) were concluded in Maximum Security. Writer Kurt Busiek stated that he wrote the story out of 'self-defense', having been told that Marvel was looking for a big crossover story and that he either had to come up with one, or he'd be participating in someone else's. His original synopsis was for a story called 'Y2KANG' where when the clock ticked over at midnight of New Year's Eve 1999, it became 1900 again and all the Marvel characters would be turn-of-the-century versions of themselves. However, by the time Marvel stated this was the story they wanted to do, it couldn't be solicited until April 2000 and wouldn't have made any sense. Busiek's second suggestion was 'Maximum Security', the concept of which was influenced by Australian history and how the British used Australia as a place to dump convicts, too far away from Britain for them to escape and return. Busiek thought it would be fun if the galactic powers that be viewed Earth the same way, dumping their criminals here and not caring about what happened to the natives. Busiek needed someone to play the 'alien cop' and chose U.S. Agent, saying that he hadn't been used much lately and was inspired by the character. He was influenced by Tommy Lee Jones character from the movie The Fugitive because he was 'a tough, no nonsense Federal Agent who didn't care about your sob stories, just that if you broke the law you were going to jail', considering the characters personality to be 'very USAgent-y.'Interview with Kurt Busiek https://www.facebook.com/groups/505247186277499/search/?query=kurt%20busiek Plot Thor, Tigra, Starfox, Quasar, Moondragon, Photon and the Jack of Hearts become the temporary Avengers Infinity squad when they travel into space and encounter a group of cosmic entities called the Infinites. The Infinites planned to rearrange galaxies (destroying all life in those galaxies in the process) in order to improve the flow of their energies. The heroes convinced the Infinites not to destroy the Earth and the other threatened planets. At the end, the unofficial team began to make their way to an intergalactic bar.Avengers Infinity #1-4 (Sept - Dec 2001) Meanwhile, at the Intergalactic Council, the Skrull ambassador files a formal complaint against humans, charging that Professor X and a band of Skrull mutants, known as Cadre K, have been interfering in the extermination of other Skrull mutants. The Council is attacked by Ego the Living Planet, and are rescued by Professor X and Cadre K. A new race, the Ruul, help to miniaturize and imprison Ego. Despite the human assistance, the council sides with the Skrulls and vote to take action against Earth.Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet one-shot (Dec 2000) Earth's solar system is surrounded by a force field, and Earth is turned into a prison for intergalactic criminals, reasoning that the criminals will keep Earth too occupied to do anything about the wider universe. Ronan the Accuser acts as warden from an orbiting space craft. The Avengers learn the miniaturized Ego was among the aliens condemned to Earth, and that he is expanding and becoming one with the Earth. At the rate it grows, it could possibly assimilate the entire planet Earth within a week.Maximum Security #1 (Jan 2001) Iron Man, the Fantastic Four, and the Silver Surfer work to stop Ego from expanding. Meanwhile, Cadre K are trying to convince the Intergalactic Council to reverse its actions, but are resisted by the Skrull Ambassador. On Earth, people are rallying the alien criminals to fight back against Ronan.Maximum Security #2 (Jan 2001) Meanwhile, at a S.H.I.E.L.D. base on the moon, the Ruul release their leader, the Supreme Intelligence.Thunderbolts #45 (Jan 2001) At the same time, Cadre K is imprisoned as a result of their interruption of the council meeting.X-Men #107 (Jan 2001) While the Avengers Infinity group are held by the Shi'ar, the Ruul imprison them under the orders of the Supreme Intelligence.

Career and personal life Hoare was born in Barnes, Surrey, and was descended from Sir Richard Hoare, Lord Mayor of London, the founder of the family banking business, Hoare's Bank. His parents were Sir Richard Hoare, 1st Baronet (1735‚Äì1787) and Anne Hoare (1737‚Äì1759). He was educated at preparatory school at Mr. Devis's school, Wandsworth, and afterwards at Samuel Glasse's school at Greenford, and was taught the Classics by the Rev. Joseph Eyre. In 1783 Hoare married Hester, daughter of William Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton. In 1785 he inherited the large Stourhead estate in Wiltshire from his grandfather, Henry Hoare II,Hutchings, V. p 84 which enabled him to pursue his interests including the archaeological studies for which he had already shown an inclination. His inheritance came with the condition that he left the family's banking business, since Henry Hoare II wished to ensure the survival of the estate if the family's other business suffered eventual hardships. In 1785, Hoare's wife died following the birth of their second child, who also died. Having lost his wife and previous career, he embarked on a continental tour to France, Italy and Switzerland.Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Recollections Abroad, During the Years 1785, 1786, 1787 (Bath: Richard Cruttwell, 1815), text online In 1786 he purchased Glastonbury Tor and funded the restoration of the church tower on it. He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1787, and in 1788 made a second continental tour,Hutchings, p. 85 the record of his travels appearing in 1815 and 1819 under the titles Recollections Abroad and A Classical Tour through Italy and Sicily.Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Recollectionds Abroad, During the Years 1790: Sicily and Malta (Bath: Richard Cruttwell, 1817), text online He took numerous views during his travels in the form of sketches from which he later produced mainly sepia wash drawings, along with a smaller number of watercolours. His tutor John 'Warwick' Smith, and the painter Francis Nicholson, were also commissioned to produce coloured reductions from some of his continental sketches. Bound in volumes, many of these were dispersed in the Stourhead sales of the 1880s. Monument to Sir Richard Colt Hoare in Salisbury Cathedral A journey through Wales was followed by a translation of the Itinerarium Cambriae and of the Descriptio Cambriae of Gerald of Wales, with Hoare adding notes and a life of Gerald to his translation. This work was first published in 1804, and was subsequently revised by Thomas Wright (1810‚Äì1877) in 1863. Hoare's further Tour in Ireland was published in 1807.Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Journal of a Tour in Ireland, A.D. 1806 (London: William Miller, 1807), text online Hoare was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1792 and was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was appointed High Sheriff of Wiltshire for 1805. In 1825, Hoare donated his collection of Italian works on topography and history to the British Museum.  Death  He died at Stourhead in 1838. His mausoleum in the churchyard of St Peter's in Stourton, the estate village, is under a pinnacled Gothic canopy designed by John Pinch the Elder.  Contributions to archaeology  The first recorded excavations at Stonehenge were made by William Cunnington and Richard Colt Hoare in 1798 and again in 1810. They dug around a fallen trilithon and a fallen slaughter stone, and discovered that they had once stood up. Colt Hoare excavated 379 barrows on Salisbury Plain as well as identifying many other sites in the area, publishing and classifying his findings. However, as the three-age system had not yet been introduced he was unable to date his finds and was therefore at a disadvantage when trying to interpret them. His two- volume book The Ancient History of Wiltshire outlined his findings; this work was first published in five parts from 1810 to 1821, for binding in two volumes. Hoare's most important work was his Ancient History of North and South Wiltshire (1812‚Äì1819); he also sponsored and contributed significantly to the 11 volumes of the History of Modern Wiltshire (1822‚Äì1844).

It lies on the banks of the River Avon on the lower slopes of Bredon Hill, at \\"the beginning of the Cotswolds\\".Stanley Baldwin, former Prime Minister. As \\"Brensham Village\\", it has been made famous by the writer John Moore, whose descriptions of village life between the wars are widely celebrated.Moore, J. (1946). Brensham Village. Location and geography Bredon is located 3 miles (5 km) north of the Gloucestershire town of Tewkesbury on the B4080 road. The River Avon forms the western boundary of the parish, and two of its tributaries, the Carrant Brook and Squitter Brook form the southern boundary. The parish extends from the Avon valley floor at an elevation of 32 feet (10 m) in the south-west to the upper slopes of Bredon Hill at an elevation of 820 feet (250 m) in the north-east. The northern third of the parish falls within the Cotswolds AONB. At its greatest extent the parish measures approximately 4.8 miles (7.7 km) long by 2.2 miles (3.5 km) wide, and covers around 4,119 acres (16.7 km2). Population Bredon parish includes the hamlets of Bredon's Hardwick, Kinsham and Westmancote. At the 2011 census the parish had a population of 2,542. History Bredon's history of farming and settlement goes back at least four thousand years. Archaeological remains establish that parts of the parish were settled early in the Bronze Age (2500‚Äì800 BC).Bredon Village Design Statement, retrieved 23 November 2011. There are numerous Iron Age (800 BC‚Äì100 AD) remains, some of which would have related to Kemerton Camp, a large univallate hillfort at the summit of Bredon Hill. The parish is also rich in remains from the Roman Period (43‚Äì410 AD), revealing a continuing history of settlement and farming. Modern Bredon has its roots in the Anglo-Saxon period (c.500‚Äì1066), when c.716 √Üthelbald, King of Mercia, gave land to his kinsman Eanwulf the grandfather of Offa to found a monastery. For some time, the manor of Bredon continued under an abbot of its own, but by 844, it had become the property of the Bishop of Worcester. It remained part of the Worcester Monastic Estate until the Reformation. Bredon's name evolved during the Saxon period, deriving from bree (Celtic for hill) and don (Old English for hill). From the Norman Conquest (1066) to the end of the Late Medieval Period (1500), the parish was governed under the feudal system. The manor was held by the Bishop of Worcester, who maintained a summer residence, park and fisheries on the site of the first monastery, and the medieval village developed around these church buildings. Following the Reformation in the 16th century, the manor passed to the Crown. In 1718, wealthy resident William Hancock founded Bredon Hancock's Endowed Church of England First School. Bredon's Act of Inclosure was passed in 1811, and among those gaining large consolidated holdings were the lord of the manor, Rev. Richard Darke, and the rector, Rev. John Keysall.Victoria County History, A History of the County of Worcester: volume 3, 1913. The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, one of the world's oldest main line railways, was constructed during the 1830s and 1840s through the village, with Bredon railway station opening in 1841. This remained in operation until 1965, when it was closed under the Beeching Axe. The station is currently closed on the Cross Country Route. In February 1971, a new section of the M5 motorway was opened, cutting through the parish to the west of the village. In the 1960s, a housing estate of some 600 dwellings was developed on land formerly belonging to Mitton Manor in the extreme south of the parish, which was then transferred to neighbouring Tewkesbury parish. The 1970s and 1980s saw a very rapid growth in the residential population of the village, with the addition of approximately 600 new homes located on former orchards, allotments and farmland. Much of this growth was poorly planned, resulting in a dormitory settlement, reliant on nearby towns for employment and services.Bredon Village Design Statement. Buildings There are 43 listed buildings in the village, including St Giles's Church and Bredon Barn (both Grade I), and the Old Rectory (Grade II*); the remainder are Grade II. A further 41 buildings were formerly listed prior to the abolition of the Grade III category in 1970. As is the case in most Cotswold villages, a variety of architectural styles and materials are in evidence, but almost all historic buildings are at least partly built from Cotswold limestone, quarried on Bredon Hill. Timber frame construction was used as a secondary material up until the mid-17th century (often not painted black and white until the 20th century). The earliest surviving building in the village, the parish church of St Giles, is one of England's most admired churches.Jenkins, S. (1999). England's Thousand Best Churches. It is built largely in the Norman, Early English and Decorated styles. A substantial part of the nave, the north porch and the western tower arch date from the 12th century, with significant additions in the 13th and 14th centuries ‚Äì the most visible being a tall, octagonal spire, dating from 1300‚Äì1350, made famous by the poet, John Masefield. A number of 14th century heraldic tiles are set in the sanctuary steps, showing the arms of England, France, Beauchamp of Powick, Beauchamp of Warwick, Mortimer, Berkeley and others. The church contains many interesting monuments, including several to members of the interrelated Reed, Copley and Parsons families. To the west of the church is Bredon Barn,Bredon Barn , National Trust, retrieved 27 June 2009. a late 14th century threshing barn (often incorrectly referred to as a tithe barn) measuring approximately 40 metres by 12 metres. It has an enormous steep pitched roof covered in Cotswold limestone tiles. Walls are of limestone rubble masonry, divided into 9 bays by oak posts on stone plinths forming aisles, and carrying the open timber roof. The barn was badly damaged by fire in 1980. Now restored, it is in the care of the National Trust. Natural history Bredon and its surroundings are exceptionally rich in wildlife, boasting sites of international importance for their rare fauna.Natural England, Bredon Hill SSSI citation. The parish contains parts of the Bredon Hill Special Area of Conservation; parts of three Sites of Special Scientific Interest; and parts of twelve Local Wildlife Sites (the best sites in Worcestershire not covered by national designations). Bredon Hill has been recognised as the third most important site in the UK for dead-wood beetles and other invertebrates,Whitehead P & J. (1991‚Äì96).

The north of the parish is the richest area in Worcestershire for rare arable plants.The 1 km square (SO9438) is ranked by Plantlife as the richest in Worcestershire for arable flora. Kemerton Lake Nature Reserve (half in the parish), managed by the Kemerton Conservation Trust, is the West Midlands Region's most important site for dragonflies, with 22 species recorded.Kemerton Conservation Trust, retrieved 23 November 2011. It is also Worcestershire's most important site for jack snipe, and more than 170 other bird species have been recorded here. Purple milk-vetch, violet click beetle, barbastelle bat, lesser horseshoe bat, otter, polecat and great- crested newt are some of the other interesting species found in and around the village.

Discovery and naming In 2000 Oliver Walter Mischa Rauhut reported the find of tyrannosauroid material in the lignite coal mine of Guimarota near Leiria, which he referred to Stokesosaurus.Rauhut, O.W.M., 2000, \\"The dinosaur fauna from the Guimarota mine\\", pp 75-82 In: Martin and Krebs (eds.). Guimarota - A Jurassic Ecosystem Verlag Dr. Friedrich Pfeil, M√ºnchen Later concluding the distinctiveness of the material justified a separate genus, Rauhut in 2003 named and described it as the type species Aviatyrannis jurassica. The species name was by Rauhut given the intended meaning of \\"tyrant's grandmother from the Jurassic\\". The generic name is derived from Latin avia, \\"grandmother\\", and tyrannus, \\"tyrant\\", on the presumption tyrannis would be its genitive. The specific name means \\"Jurassic\\". The holotype, IPFUB Gui Th 1, was found in a layer of the Alcoba√ßa Formation dating from the early Kimmeridgian, about 155 million years old. It consists of a right ilium. Rauhut in 2003 referred two other bones to Aviatyrannis: IPFUB Gui Th 2, a partial right ilium, and IPFUB Gui Th 3, a right ischium. The referred elements represent slightly larger individuals. Additionally sixteen isolated teeth were referred: IPFUB GUI D 89-91: three teeth of the premaxilla, and IPFUB GUI D 174-186: thirteen teeth of the maxilla and dentary. These had in 1998 been described by Jens Zinke.Zinke, J., 1998, \\"Small theropod teeth from the Upper Jurassic coal mine of Guimarota (Portugal)\\", Pal√§ontologische Zeitschrift 72(1/2): 179-189 Rauhut also hypothesised that a number of specimens referred to Stokesosaurus might actually belong to Aviatyrannis. Description Estimated size of Aviatyrannis. Like other early tyrannosauroids, Aviatyrannis was a rather small bipedal predator. The holotype specimen IPFUB Gui Th 1, for example, is an ilium only ninety millimeters long. It may have belonged to a juvenile.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 100 In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at one metre, its weight at five kilogrammes. The ilium is elongated and low with the typical tyrannosauroid vertical ridge on the outer blade surface above the hip joint. The teeth of the praemaxilla have a D-shaped cross-section. The maxillary and dentary teeth are elongated, only recurving near the top, with perpendicular denticles on both edges. Their bases are circular in cross- section; the top of the tooth crown is more flattened. Classification Aviatyrannis was in 2003 by Rauhut placed in the Tyrannosauroidea, in a basal position. Aviatyrannis is one of the oldest tyrannosauroids ever found, the oldest being Proceratosaurus (or, possibly, Iliosuchus).

The Egerton Gospel (British Library Egerton Papyrus 2) refers to a collection of three papyrus fragments of a codex of a previously unknown gospel, found in Egypt and sold to the British Museum in 1934; the physical fragments are now dated to the very end of the 2nd century CE. Together they comprise one of the oldest surviving witnesses to any gospel, or any codex. The British Museum lost no time in publishing the text: acquired in the summer of 1934, it was in print in 1935. It is also called the Unknown Gospel, as no ancient source makes reference to it, in addition to being entirely unknown before its publication. Provenance Three fragments of the manuscript form part of the Egerton Collection in the British Library. A fourth fragment of the same manuscript has since been identified in the papyrus collection of the University of Cologne. The provenance of the four fragments is a matter of some dispute. Throughout the 20th century the provenance of the Egerton fragments was kept anonymous, with the initial editors suggesting without proof that they came from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri. In 2019 it was established that they were purchased in 1934 from Maurice Nahman, an antiquities dealer in Cairo. Nahman purchased the manuscript sometime between the 1920s and 1934, without recording its origin. Nahman bragged that he had many origins for his manuscripts. The Oxyrynchus identification is thus in question. The Cologne fragment was deposited without any provenance whatsoever. Circumstantial evidence suggests that this was purchased from Nahman's estate at the time of his death in 1954. Colin Henderson Roberts reported seeing an account of the Passion of Jesus in Nahman's collection. Other Biblical scholars urgently pursued this missing fragment, but Nahman's collection was sold off indiscriminately to many different European universities and private collectors. The names of buyers were not recorded and the final whereabouts of this fragment, if it exists, are unknown. Contents The surviving fragments include four stories: 1) a controversy similar to John 5:39-47 and 10:31-39; 2) curing a leper similar to Matt 8:1-4, Mark 1:40-45, Luke 5:12-16 and Luke 17:11-14; 3) a controversy about paying tribute to Caesar analogous to Matt 22:15-22, Mark 12:13-17, Luke 20:20-26; and 4) an incomplete account of a miracle on the Jordan River bank, perhaps carried out to illustrate the parable about seeds growing miraculously. The latter story has no equivalent in canonical Gospels: > Jesus walked and stood on the bank of the Jordan river; he reached out his > right hand, and filled it.... And he sowed it on the... And > then...water...and...before their eyes; and it brought forth > fruit...many...for joy... Dating the manuscript Papyrus K√∂ln 255, University of Cologne. The date of the manuscript is established through paleography alone. When the Egerton fragments were first published its date was estimated at around 150 CE;Bell & Skeat implying that, of early Christian papyri it would be rivalled in age only by , the John Rylands Library fragment of the Gospel of John. Later, when an additional papyrus fragment of the Egerton Gospel text was identified in the University of Cologne collection (Papyrus K√∂ln 255) and published in 1987, it was found to fit on the bottom of one of the British Library papyrus pages. In this additional fragment a single use of a hooked apostrophe in between two consonants was observed, a practice that became standard in Greek punctuation at the beginning of the 3rd century; and this sufficed to revise the date of the Egerton manuscript. This study placed the manuscript to around the time of Bodmer Papyri , c. 200; noting that Eric Turner had confirmed the paleographic dating of as around 200 CE, citing use of the hooked apostrophe in that papyrus in support of this date. The revised dating for the Egerton Papyrus continues to carry wide support. However, Stanley Porter has reviewed the dating of the Egerton Papryus alongside that of ; noting that the scholarly consensus dating the former to the turn of the third century and the latter to the first half of the second century was contra-indicated by close paleographic similarities of the two manuscripts.Porter, p. 83. The 1987 redating of the Egerton Papyrus had rested on a comment made by Eric Turner in 1971 \\"in the first decade of III AD this practice (of using an apostrophe between two consonants, such as double mutes or double liquids) suddenly becomes extremely common, and then persists.\\".Eric G Turner, Greek Manuscripts of the Ancient World, Oxford, OUP, 1971, p11 n50 Porter notes that Turner had then nevertheless advanced several earlier dated examples of the practice from the later second century, and one (BGU III 715.5) dated to 101 CE. Porter proposes that, notwithstanding the discovery of the hooked apostrophe in P. K√∂ln 255, the original editors' proposal of a mid second century date for the Egerton Papyrus accords better with the paleographic evidence of dated comparator documentary and literary hands for both and this papyrus \\"the middle of the second century, perhaps tending towards the early part of it\\".Porter, p. 84. Date of composition Jon B. Daniels writes the following in his introduction in The Complete Gospels: > On the one hand, some scholars have maintained that Egerton's unknown author > composed by borrowing from the canonical gospels. This solution has not > proved satisfactory for several reasons: The Egerton Gospel's parallels to > the synoptic gospels lack editorial language peculiar to the synoptic > authors, Matthew, Mark, and Luke. They also lack features that are common to > the synoptic gospels, a difficult fact to explain if those gospels were > Egerton's source. > On the other hand, suggestions that the Egerton Gospel served as a source > for the authors of Mark and/or John also lack conclusive evidence. The most > likely explanation for the Egerton Gospel's similarities and differences > from the canonical gospels is that Egerton's author made independent use of > traditional sayings and stories of Jesus that also were used by the other > gospel writers. Such traditional sayings are posited for the hypothetical Q Document. Ronald Cameron states: \\"Since Papyrus Egerton 2 displays no dependence upon the gospels of the New Testament, its earliest possible date of composition would be sometime in the middle of the first century, when the sayings and stories which underlie the New Testament first began to be produced in written form. The latest possible date would be early in the second century, shortly before the copy of the extant papyrus fragment was made. Because this papyrus presents traditions in a less developed form than John does, it was probably composed in the second half of the first century, in Syria, shortly before the Gospel of John was written.\\" Fran√ßois Bovon observes that the Egerton fragments \\"sound very Johannine\\" but also includes a number of terms characteristic of the Gospel of Luke, and is especially similar to and . Helmut Koester and J. D. Crossan have argued that despite its apparent historical importance, the text is not well known. It is a mere fragment, and does not bear a clear relationship to any of the four canonical gospels. The Egerton Gospel has been largely ignored outside a small circle of scholars. The work cannot be dismissed as \\"apocrypha\\" or \\"heretical\\" without compromising the orthodoxy of the Gospel of John. Nor can it be classed as \\"gnostic\\" and dismissed as marginal. It seems to be almost independent of the synoptic gospels and to represent a tradition similar to the canonical John, but independent of it. Additionally it tells us an otherwise unknown miracle, in the Johannine manner. Conservative scholar Craig Evans supports a date for the Egerton Gospel later than the canonical Gospels in a variety of ways. He finds many parallels between the Egerton Gospel and the canonical Gospels that include editorial language particular to Matthew and Luke. While Koester argues that these show a tradition before the other gospels, Craig Evans sees these as drawing from the other Gospels just as Justin Martyr did. He also finds words such as the plural \\"priests\\" that show lack of knowledge of Jewish customs.Evans, Craig A. Jesus: How Modern Scholars Distort the Gospels. Downers Grove, IL: Ivp Books, 2008.

The Nationalist forces involved in the Battle of Guadalajara were primarily the Italian Corps of Volunteer Troops (Corpo Truppe Volontarie, or CTV). The battle opened with an Italian offensive on 8 March. This offensive was halted by 11 March. Between 12 March and 14 March, renewed Italian attacks were supported by Spanish Nationalist units. These were halted too. On 15 March, a Republican counter-offensive was prepared. The Republicans successfully launched their counter-offensive from 18 March to 23 March. Background After the collapse of the third offensive on Madrid, Spanish Nationalist General Francisco Franco decided to continue with a fourth offensive aimed at closing the pincer around the capital. The Nationalist forces, although victorious at the Battle of the Jarama River, were exhausted and could not create the necessary momentum to carry the operation through. However, the Italians were optimistic after the capture of M√°laga, and it was thought that the Italian forces could score an easy victory owing to the heavy losses sustained by the People's Republican Army at Jarama. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini endorsed the operation and committed Italian units to it. The Italian commander, General Mario Roatta, planned to surround the defences of Madrid from the north-east. After joining the Spanish Nationalist corps \\"Madrid\\" on the Jarama River, they would begin the assault on Madrid. The Italian forces would execute the main attack. The Spanish division \\"Soria\\" was present to secure the operation, but played no part in the first five days of fighting. The main attack began in the 25 km- wide pass at Guadalajara-Alcal√° de Henares. This region was well suited for an advance, as there were five roads of high quality running through it. Three other roads in the area led to Guadalajara, allowing for the possibility of capturing this town as well. The Nationalist forces had 35,000 soldiers, 222 artillery pieces, 108 L3/33 tankettes and L3/35 tankettes, 32 armoured cars, 3,685 motor vehicles, and 60 Fiat CR.32 fighter planes. The Italian tankettes and armoured cars were organized as the \\"Tank and Armoured Cars Group\\" (Agrupaci√≥n de carros de asalto y autos blindados). The Italian aircraft were organized into the \\"Legionary Air Force\\" (Aviazione Legionaria). The Republican presence in the Guadalajara region consisted only of the 12th Division of the People's Republican Army under Colonel Lacalle. He had under his command 10,000 soldiers with only 5,900 rifles, 85 machine guns, and 15 artillery pieces. One company of T-26 light tanks were also sent to the area. No defensive works had been constructed in the Guadalajara region, because it was regarded as a peaceful part of the front. The People's Republican Army staff was sure that the next Fascist offensive would come from the south. Italian offensive March 8 After 30 minutes' artillery fire and air raids on the Republican positions, the Italians began advancing towards the 50th Republican brigade. Led by tankettes, they broke through the Republican line. Their assault then slowed, mainly because fog and sleet had reduced visibility down to in places. The Italians captured 10 to 12 km of terrain, including the towns of Mirabueno, Alaminos and Castejon. Falling back, the Republican commander requested infantry reinforcements and the company of tanks. March 9 Italian tankettes advancing with a flame thrower tank in the lead at Guadalajara. The Nationalists continued their assault on Republican positions. The main attack was carried out with tanks, but was again bogged down by poor performance and low visibility. The Republican 50th Brigade escaped without a fight. At about noon, the Italian advance was suddenly turned back by battalions of the XI International Brigade (battalions involved were initially the Edgar Andr√© Battalion, Th√§lmann Battalion and Commune de Paris Battalion ‚Äì with soldiers mainly from Germany, France, and the Balkan countries). The Italians on the Nationalist side had taken another 15 to 18 km of terrain and the towns of Almadrones, Cogollor, and Masegoso. In the evening, the first formations of Italian troops reached the suburb of Brihuega, where they settled down to await a widened breach in the Republican lines. This break in momentum, though incompatible with the blitzkrieg tactics they were nominally following, was under the circumstances necessary to allow the soldiers to rest. The Republican forces on this day consisted of the XI International Brigade, two artillery batteries and two companies of infantry from the 49th Brigade, 12th Division. They had 1,850 soldiers with 1,600 rifles, 34 machine guns, 6 artillery pieces, and 5 tanks. By the end of the day, more reinforcements started to arrive as Colonel Enrique Jurado Barrio was ordered to form IV Corps with L√≠ster's 11 Division in the centre at the Madrid‚ÄìZaragoza road at Torija, 12th Division on the left flank and 14th Division on the right. March 10 The Republican forces received new reinforcements: Italians and Poles from the XII International Brigade (two battalions; Jaros≈Çaw Dabrowski Battalion and Giuseppe Garibaldi Battalion), three artillery batteries, and an understrength battalion of tanks. The Republican forces now had 4,350 soldiers, 8 mortars, 16 artillery pieces and 26 light tanks. In the morning Italian forces on the Nationalist side launched heavy artillery and air bombardments and began the assault on the XI International Brigade without success. At that point they had 26,000 soldiers, 900 machine guns, 130 light tanks and a large number of artillery pieces committed to battle. The Nationalists captured the towns Miralrio and Brihuega. The latter town was taken almost unopposed. Nationalist attacks on XI and XII International Brigades continued throughout the afternoon, still without success. At Torija, they met the Italian Garibaldi Battalion. During the skirmish the Italians from the Garibaldi Battalion took the opportunity to encourage the Fascist soldiers to join the Republicans. The attacks were halted towards evening, and the Italian Nationalist units built defensive positions. At the end of the day, Lacalle resigned his command, officially for health reasons, but probably because of his resentment over being passed over by Jurado. Command over 12th Division was given to the Italian communist Nino Nanetti. March 11 The Italians began a successful advance on the positions of XI and XII International Brigades, who were forced to retreat down the main road. The Italian vanguard was stopped some 3 km before the town of Torija. The Spanish Nationalist division \\"Soria\\" captured the towns of Hita and Torre del Burgo. Republican counterattacks March 12 The Republican forces under L√≠ster's command redeployed in the morning and launched a counterattack at noon. Close to one-hundred \\"Chato\\" and \\"Rata\\" fighter planes and two squadrons of Katiuska bombers of the Spanish Republican Air Force had been made available at the Albacete airfield. While the aircraft of the Italian Legionary Air Force were grounded on water-logged airports, the Republicans did not have this problem since the Albacete airfield had a concrete strip. After an air bombardment of the Italian positions, the Republican infantry supported by T-26 and BT-5 light tanks attacked the Italian lines. Several Italian tankettes were lost when General Roatta attempted to change the position of his motorized units in the muddy terrain; many got stuck and were easy target for strafing fighters. The advance reached Trijueque. An Italian counterattack did not regain lost terrain. March 13 The Republican counterattack on Trijueque and Casa del Cabo, Palacio de Ibarra was launched with some success. The plan was to concentrate 11th Division under L√≠ster and all armoured units on the Zaragoza road, while 14th Division under Mera crossed the Taju√±a River to attack Brihuega. The Italians were warned that this might happen, but ignored advice from the Spanish chief of operations, Colonel Barroso. Mera nearly failed to cross the river, but local CNT members advised him where to place a pontoon bridge. March 14‚Äì17 On March 14, most Republican infantry formations rested while their air forces executed successful attacks. The International Brigade captured the Palacio de Ibarra. In the subsequent days the Republicans redeployed and concentrated their forces. The Republican forces now consisted of some 20,000 soldiers, 17 mortars, 28 artillery pieces, 60 light tanks and 70 planes. The Italian and Spanish Nationalist forces consisted of some 45,000 soldiers, 70 mortars, 200 artillery pieces, 80 light tanks (L3 tankettes), and 50 planes. Destruction in aftermath of the battle March 18 At dawn, Mera led 14th Division across the pontoon bridge over the Taju√±a River. They had cover from heavy sleet, but the weather also delayed the assault. After midday, the weather had improved enough to allow the Republican air force to operate. At around 13:30, Jurado gave the order to attack. L√≠ster was slowed by the Italian Littorio Division, arguably the best of the Italian units. 14th Division nearly managed to surround Brihuega, and the Italians retreated in panic. Remaining Italian soldiers were cleared out by the XI International Brigade. An Italian counterattack on Republican positions failed. The Littorio Division saved the Italians from a complete disaster when they conducted a well-organized retreat. March 19‚Äì23 The Republican forces recaptured the cities of Gajanejos and Villaviciosa de Taju√±a. Their counter-offensive was ultimately halted on the Valdearenas‚ÄìLedanca‚ÄìHontanares line, because Franco had sent reserve formations to settle the line of defence between Ledanca and Hontanares. Aftermath Nationalist forces at Guadalajara. The Battle of Guadalajara was an important strategic victory of the Republican Army and did much to lift morale. Herbert Matthews claimed in The New York Times that Guadalajara was \\"to Fascism what the defeat at Bail√©n had been to Napoleon.\\"Beevor, Battle, p. 246 The British press heaped scorn on this \\"new Caporetto\\"--alluding to a great Italian defeat in the First World War--while former British prime minister David Lloyd George wrote mockingly of the \\"Italian skedaddle,\\" infuriating Mussolini.Knox (1986), p. 6Preston (1986), p. 83 The Italian CTV lost some 3,000 men (Spanish Nationalist losses were marginal) and a considerable number of light tanks. In addition, the Republican army captured sizeable quantities of badly-needed mat√©riel and equipment, including 35 artillery pieces, 85 machine guns, and 67 vehicles. Strategically, the Republican victory prevented the encirclement of Madrid, ending Franco's hopes of crushing the Republic with a decisive strike at its capital. Franco decided to adopt a new strategy of chipping away at the Republican territories, starting in the north. Above all, Guadalajara was a setback to Italian morale and a loss of prestige for Italy's fascist regime, whose Duce had orchestrated the deployment of the Italian army in the hopes of stunning the world with a show of Italy's \\"iron military strength.\\"Thomas, p. 501 In response, Franco (who feared CTV strategic independence, especially after the Italian victory at Malaga) announced his intention to dismantle the Italian field army in Spain, seeking to disperse it among Spanish Nationalist units. This threat was not ultimately carried out and Guadalajara in a sense guaranteed and continued Italian aid as Mussolini sought final victory to efface his humiliation at Guadalajara. But, after all, Guadalajara remained the first and the only setback for the Italian army in Spain. After Guadalajara, the CTV achieved repeatedly effective performance and decisive successes. Nationalist circles, which had come to resent the Italian expeditionary force for its early victories, brimmed with Schadenfreude over their allies' humiliation.Payne (1987), p. 131 Officers in General Moscard√≥'s HQ raised a toast to \\"Spanish heroism, of whatever colour\\"--probably the only time Nationalist forces toasted a Republican triumph of arms.Preston, Paul. Franco. Fontana, 1993, p. 233. Franco's soldiers began singing popular Italian tunes with lyrical changes mocking the defeated CTV. The following chorus, originating with Moscard√≥'s Navarrese, humorously takes the Italians to task for their earlier complaints about the lack of motorized transport in Nationalist ranks:Colodny (2009), p. 141 { cellpadding=6 - style=\\"vertical- align:top; white-space:nowrap;\\"  :Guadalajara no es Abisinia, :Los espa√±oles, aunque rojos, son valientes, :Menos camiones y m√°s cojones  :Guadalajara is not Abyssinia, :Spaniards, even the red ones, are brave, :[You need] fewer trucks and more balls } The CTV most likely lost the battle because Franco did not start a side offensive, from Jarama toward Alcal√† de Henares, as agreed on March 1 with General Roatta. After seeing that the Nationalists were not attacking, the Republicans were able to redeploy the troops facing Jarama to meet the Italian offensive. Later, when faced by General Roatta, Franco tried to excuse himself saying that his Generals ignored his orders to advance. It is possible he used the Italian troops as cannon fodder to gain time to regroup his troops, exhausted after Jarama. This is explained by the Franco's fear towards the Italians and their attitude to win the war \\"alone\\", forcing the Caudillo's war leadership. This also explains the ungrateful songs against the Italians which despite all were decisively contributing with personnel and equipment to the nationalist cause. Analysis British historian Paul Preston identified several factors contributing to the Italian debacle:Preston, Paul. Franco. Fontana, 1993, pp. 229-31. *The tenacity of Republican resistance. Deceived by the easy triumph of their mechanized columns over underarmed and panick-stricken Republican militias at M√°laga, the Italians underestimated the qualitative level achieved by well-organized Republican forces defending Madrid *Inadequate preparation of the Italians-- many wearing colonial uniforms--to conditions of heavy snow and sleet *Lack of permanent runways for Italian aviation, which left CTV craft sunken in muddy airfields and prey to Republican aviation *Overall inaction of Nationalist forces on the Jarama front (a modest attack was launched on March 9), allowing the Republicans to concentrate additional forces along the Guadalajara *The superiority of Russian T-26 tanks, equipped with rotating turret guns, over Italian tankettes *Roatta's failure--which Preston describes as grossly negligent--to entrench the Italian corps along its new positions in anticipation of a Republican counterattack The minimal success of the Italian offensive demonstrated the vulnerability of massed armoured advances in unfavourable terrain and against a coherent infantry defence. The French General Staff, in harmony with existing beliefs in the French Army, concluded that mechanized troops were not the decisive element of modern warfare and continued to shape their military doctrine accordingly. A notable exception to this view was Charles de Gaulle. The Germans escaped this conclusion by incorrectly dismissing the Guadalajara failure being the product of leadership and planning. The German attach√® in service at the CTV command during the battle, anyway, had words of praise for the combat attitude of the Italian troops. In truth, both views had some merit: armoured forces were largely ineffective against prepared defences organized in depth; in adverse weather, and without proper air support, the result was disaster (Italian strategists failed to consider these variables).Thomas, p. 501. Thomas notes that \\"the Italians had not maintained fighting contact with their enemies and had not taken the weather into account at all. But the German assessment incorrectly noted the deficiencies in Italian weaponry, planning, and organization that contributed to their defeat at Guadalajara. In particular, their vehicles and tanks had lacked the technical quality and their leaders the determination necessary to effect the violent breakthroughs characteristic of later German blitzkrieg tactics.

Biography  Oscar Montelius refined the concept of typology, a relative chronological dating method. Typology is the procedure of working out a chronology by arranging material remains of a cultural tradition in the order that produces the most consistent patterning of their cultural traits. Typologies are the basis for seriation, a technique developed by English Egyptologist Flinders Petrie (1853‚Äì1942) based on his excavations in Egypt. Montelius' impetus was at first to provide relative dates for artifacts in museum collections that often lacked rigorous records, by making comparisons with other artifacts within a comparable geographical area. Montelius' method created a timeline specific to the location, based on material remains. Later, when combined with written historical references, objects could be provided absolute dates. He took the three-age system (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age), originally devised by Danish antiquarian Christian J√ºrgensen Thomsen (1788‚Äì1865) to organize Danish museum collections of archaeological materials, and sub-divided it further. He divided the Neolithic in Scandinavia into four numbered periods, I-IV, and the Nordic Bronze Age into six I-VI. He was the first to establish that the numerous Swedish petroglyphs were from the Nordic Bronze Age, by comparing axes portrayed in the petroglyphs with archaeological finds. Further he supported Thomsen's typology of gold bracteates from the migration period. By taking calendrical dates from the recently deciphered hieroglyphics of Ancient Egypt, Montelius employed a complex system of cross-dating through typologies and associated finds to apply absolute dates to archaeological finds and features all over Europe. His diffusionist theories were eventually displaced by more complex views of cultural interaction but following refinement his system of sub-divisions is still effectively in use. Montelius was made a member of the Swedish Academy in 1917. Personal life Oscar Montelius was married to Swedish philanthropist and feminist Agda Montelius n√©e Reuterski√∂ld (1850‚Äì1920). He and Agda Montelius are buried in a dolmen grave (a type of grave that was common in Sweden during the Nordic Bronze Age) in Norra begravningsplatsen in Solna, Sweden.

Cook was one of the founding members of the children's band the Wiggles from 1991 to 2012. Cook provided guitar, vocals, and songwriting in the group, and remained involved with its creative and production aspects after his retirement. In 2013, Cook served as the Wiggles' tour manager. He also remained active in many music projects, including, after 2015, writing and performing with the Sydney soul- rock band the Soul Movers. In July 2020, Cook brought the original members of the Wiggles back together to create a disco-infused workout track for the Soul Movers \\"Circles Baby\\" (ABC Music) designed to lift the spirits of a nation. Career Early musical projects Cook played the guitar in the late 1980s bands the Transistors and Finger Guns before joining the Sydney-based band Bang Shang a Lang. (He continued to play for Bang Shang a Lang in Sydney, when not on tour with the Wiggles.) The Wiggles After \\"a career as a struggling musician in Sydney\\",Field, p. 28 Cook returned to university and studied early childhood education at Macquarie University, where he met Anthony Field and Greg Page and formed the Wiggles in 1991.Field, pp. 27‚Äì28 Cook worked as a preschool teacher for two years before the success of the Wiggles forced him to quit. According to Field, Cook would have been content to \\"continue teaching and perhaps move into an academic role in the field. He knows his stuff and is simply great with children\\".Field, p. 45 Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see, and said, \\"I always think that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on that would be great. I think it would be really nice if in 15 years I read that somebody got into guitar playing because of [The] Wiggles\\". Guitar Magazine speculated that since Cook was one of the first guitarists children were exposed to, he might be the most influential guitarist in the world. Cook's major musical influences were the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, and Eric Clapton. In 2007, Cook owned a collection of thirty vintage guitars. As a member of the Wiggles, Cook wore a red skivvy and served as an instrumentalist and vocalist. He came up with the Wiggles' signature index finger-wagging move after watching professional ten pin bowlers do the move on television. He was considered the intellectual and analytical member of the group (something referred to in several episodes of their TV show), so he acted as mediator for their group decisions. When the Wiggles received honorary degrees from the Australian Catholic University in 2006, Cook gave the commencement speech to the graduates. On 17 May 2012, it was announced that Cook, along with Greg Page and Jeff Fatt, would be retiring from the Wiggles at the end of the year. He was replaced by Wiggles cast member Simon Pryce. Cook and the others expected to remain involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. In 2013, Cook served as the group's tour manager. After the Wiggles Cook told the Newcastle Herald, about his music career after his retirement from the Wiggles, \\"I was kind of feeling my way for a few years, I guess\\". In addition to continuing to play with Bang Shang A Lang, he \\"began to explore other adult musical projects\\". He played keyboard on his \\"long time friend and associate\\", jazz musician Marlene Cummins' 2014 album Koori Woman Blues and wrote a track for the album, \\"The Blues It Knows Your Name\\", which was inspired by and written for Cummins. He performed lead guitar for the Proposition, \\"a Sydney-based guitar pop band fronted by singer-songwriter Luke Russell\\" on their 2015 album, Edge of the Dancefloor. Also in 2015, Cook was involved in the production of the play Sons of Sun, which was about American music producer Sam Phillips. In October 2017, Cook played guitar for the tribute show \\"The Nancy Sinatra/Lee Hazlewood Experience\\" with Zoe Carides and Scott Holmes in Newcastle, New South Wales. While exploring other projects, Cook met Lizzie Mack, a member of the Sydney soul-rock band the Soul Movers, who along with Radio Birdman guitarist Deniz Tek and founder of The Soul Movers, were relaunching the group.https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/move-on-over-wigglers-it-s- soul-time-20190312-p513ie.html In 2015, Cook began writing songs with Mack and decided to focus on the band and use it as his \\"main creative outlet\\" In 2017, the group recorded Testify, \\"an album of energetic blues, soul and rock\\". The album was recorded at the Wiggles' studio in northwest Sydney and Jeff Fatt performed keyboards for the group. In 2019, the group recorded Bona Fide, which the Sydney Morning Herald called \\"a stunning album\\". The album, which as Cook stated, included \\"more roots-oriented songs to try to reflect a wide range of American music styles\\", and was recorded in the U.S.' \\"premier soul studios\\" such as Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, and FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. In early 2018, Cook gave an \\"energetic performance\\" in the music video for the DZ Deathrays song, \\"Like People\\", which went viral online. He appeared with the group at the rock festival Splendour in the Grass in July 2018. The Soul Movers album \\"Bona Fide\\" was recorded across legendary studios in North America including Royal and Sun Studios in Memphis and Fame and Muscle Shoals Sound in Alabama (ABC Music 2019) has been nominated for best Soul/ R&B; album of 2019 in the AIR Awards. The Soul Movers play rescheduled music festival Splendour in the Grass in 2021. (Previous albums \\"Testify!\\" and \\"Evolution\\" due October 2020 (ABC Music). Personal life Cook's nickname is \\"Muzz\\". He is married to Meg Munro and has two children, a son and a daughter, wheelchair basketball player Georgia Munro-Cook. In 2018, he told the New Castle Herald, \\"I'm a big fan of music in general and go to see lots of bands\\". Cook, along with the other three original members of the Wiggles, was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2010 \\"for service to the arts, particularly children's entertainment, and to the community as benefactors and supporters of a range of charities\\". In 2015, he was one of the members of the Australian jury for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest.

He is best known as the original lead singer and a founding member of the children's band the Wiggles from 1991 to 2006 and then again from 2012 to 2013. Page has also recorded several solo albums. Career  1991‚Äì2006: Music and the Wiggles  While still a teenager, Page was a roadie for and sang with the Australian band the Cockroaches during their final years. On bandmate Anthony Field's recommendation, he enrolled in Macquarie University to study Early Childhood Education. While students, Page, Field, and guitarist Murray Cook, along with former Cockroaches member and keyboardist Jeff Fatt, combined their music backgrounds and teaching skills to form the Wiggles. The youngest member of the group, Page was 19 years old when he began touring with the group. Field described him as \\"the perfect straight man\\", with a \\"big friendly smile and easy stage manner\\" which made him engrossing for both children and adults. Also according to Field, Page \\"has an authoritative, though not overbearing, tone when he speaks to children and is a relaxed and clever emcee\\". When performing with the Wiggles, Page wore a yellow shirt. Like the other Wiggles, Page had a shtick, which was doing magic tricks. The Wiggles' high point was in 2000 when they partnered with Lyrick Studios for American distribution of their films and songs. After HIT Entertainment purchased Lyrick in 2001, the Wiggles were partnered with HiT for 6 years before moving their distribution to Warner Home Video in 2007. His 2005 solo album, Taking Care of Country, reflects Page's interest in Elvis Presley's music. It was recorded with the TCB Band, Elvis' back-up band. In spring 2003, Page performed in Las Vegas with the TCB Band. In 2002, Page sang back-up with Australian Elvis impersonator Mick Gerace. His second album with the TCB Band, Let It Be Me, was released in 2012. Production of the album began in 2004, but was interrupted due to Page's medical issues. 2006‚Äì2012: Illness and retirement On 29 November 2006, the Wiggles announced that Greg Page would leave the group due to poor health. Page had experienced health difficulties since December 2005, when he underwent a double hernia operation and withdrew from his group's U.S. tour after suffering repeated fainting spells, slurred speech, fatigue, and trembling. Although Page was missing for virtually all of the late 2006 U.S. tour, audiences were informed of Page's absence at concerts moments before the curtain went up. At first, Page was told that he had seven years to live, but he was diagnosed with a non-life- threatening form of dysautonomia, a difficult-to-diagnose chronic illness. Page experienced symptoms such as orthostatic intolerance, fatigue and loss of balance. Specialists believed that Page had mild episodes of the illness going back twelve years, and that his symptoms worsened after his hernias. It was decided that Page would retire from performing with the Wiggles to better manage his health. As part owner of the Wiggles, Page received a payout of about $20 million for his share in the business. Page was succeeded by Sam Moran as a full member of the entertainment side of the group (although still an employee, rather than a partner, in its business side). By late 2009, Page had recovered enough from his illness to begin touring with another country rock band, but with a more limited schedule than the Wiggles. He had also started his own foundation, the Greg Page Fund, to raise funds and educate the public about orthostatic intolerance. While in retirement, Page was a presenter on Sydney Weekender. 2012: Reunion with the Wiggles In January 2012, and amidst a great deal of controversy, the Wiggles announced that Page had regained his health and was returning to his role as the Yellow Wiggle. It was reported that he would return to touring with the group in March of that year. However, on 17 May 2012, it was announced that Page, along with Murray Cook and Jeff Fatt, would again be retiring from the Wiggles at the end of the year. He was to be replaced by Wiggles cast member Emma Watkins, the first female member of the Wiggles. Page eventually revealed that he was only asked to return to the group until August 2012, \\"to help transition from Sam [Moran] to a new Yellow Wiggle,\\" but once Cook and Fatt decided to retire at the end of the year, they asked Page if he would extend his stay with the group until then so he would leave alongside them, to which he agreed. Page and the others expected to remain involved with the creative and production aspects of the group, though Page no longer would have a share in the company, having forfeited it in 2006 when he left. 2012‚Äìpresent: Post-Wiggles Shortly after leaving the Wiggles, Page joined the cast of the children's educational television program Butterscotch's Playground. Page helped develop the show with its creators. From time to time, beginning in 2016, Page performed with the Wiggles for reunion shows and charity fundraisers. In July 2020, six months after suffering a heart attack, he and the classic Wiggles appeared in The Soul Movers music video \\"Circles Baby\\".https://au.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-soul-movers-live- original-wiggles-lineup-13187/ Personal life Page was born in Sydney, Australia. He owned the fourth-largest collection of Elvis Presley memorabilia in the world, including clothing, marriage certificate, guitar, piano, the last Cadillac owned by Elvis, and original TCB Band necklaces. In 2008 he donated the collection, reportedly worth $1.5 million, to a new Elvis museum in Parkes, New South Wales. Page has been married twice. His first marriage broke up during his retirement from the Wiggles; by 2011, he had remarried. He has four children. Page was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia on 26 January 2010: \\"For service to the arts, particularly children's entertainment, and to the community as a benefactor and supporter of a range of charities\\". On 17 January 2020, Page suffered cardiac arrest at a Wiggles reunion show that was raising funds for bushfire relief efforts. He collapsed on stage and stopped breathing; off-duty nurse Grace Jones, who was in the audience, performed CPR with Wiggles drummer Steve Pace and band staff member Kimmy Antonelli, and used a defibrillator three times before Page was transported to the hospital. The cardiac arrest was caused by a blocked artery, which was treated, and Page made a recovery. He later posted a video explaining the situation and expressing his gratitude to those who saved him, including Dr. Therese Wales, registered nurse Grace Jones, drummer Steve Pace, Wiggles staff member Kim Antonelli, and other members of the Wiggles‚Äô crew.

It is located in the present-day Department of Pet√©n, Guatemala. The site flourished from about the 6th century BC through the 1st century, during the Maya Pre-Classic Period (see: Mesoamerican chronology). It may have had a peak population of some 10,000 people. The site is about 25 miles (40 km) east of Tikal, on a ridge over the left bank of the Holmul river. The site has temples on step pyramids and plazas arranged to point to astronomical events such as the equinox sunrise, and is surrounded by a defensive wall. The site's largest step-pyramid is 27 metres high and 70 x 40 metres wide. Some buildings were decorated with stucco sculptures depicting Mesoamerican deities. The site was long lost in the jungle, and was discovered and partly plundered by looters around 1980. It was first mapped by explorer Ian Graham in 1984, who gave it the name Cival after a local word for \\"lagoon\\". The ancient name of the site is currently unknown. Archaeological excavations of the site began in 2001 and are ongoing , led by Dr. Francisco Estrada-Belli. The project there originally began as part of investigations at the nearby Classic Maya site of Holmul, but attention was shifted to Cival as Cival's age and importance became apparent. The excavations are sponsored by Vanderbilt University and the National Geographic Society, the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, the Ahau Foundation, ARB, Interco Tire, PIAA and Warn Industries. Investigations at Cival have added to knowledge of the Pre-Classic Maya, including revealing the earliest inscriptions with Maya calendar dates and showing dynastic succession of monarchs. Some news reports have incorrectly stated that Pre-Classic Maya cities were previously unknown. Pre-Classic buildings in the Peten have been excavated by archaeologists since the work at Uaxactun in the 1920s, and the major breakthrough which revealed that the Pre-Classic Maya were more highly developed and urbanized in this era than had long been thought was the archaeological project at El Mirador starting in the late 1970s.

Its purpose is to bring together musicians, fans of music, and grassroots progressivism to fight for social justice together. Formation In a 2007 interview, Tom Morello remarked that he formed Axis of Justice with Serj Tankian after witnessing some members of the audience at Ozzfest 2002 promoting racist symbols and imagery. In an effort to promote an adamant anti- racist and anti-fascist message, Axis of Justice allied with Anti-Racist Action shortly after its formation. Axis of Justice tents appeared at music festivals where either Audioslave (now defunct) or System of a Down were playing, as it did at Lollapalooza 2003. The Axis of Justice also puts out a monthly radio show that can be heard on Pacifica Radio station KPFK (90.7 FM) in Los Angeles, California, and on XM Satellite Radio. The shows are archived in MP3 format on the AOJ website and are available as free downloads. They also have a number of books on their website that they recommend to support their views. In 2004, they released a live album/DVD entitled Axis of Justice: Concert Series Volume 1. It contains performances by Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers, Brad Wilk from Rage Against the Machine and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave, Serj Tankian from System of a Down, Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour, Pete Yorn, Tim Walker, Maynard James Keenan of Tool, A Perfect Circle and Puscifer, and Wayne Kramer among others. It was recorded during a concert at the Avalon in Los Angeles. The concert was a benefit to raise money for the Axis of Justice and a variety of causes.

He was a member of the children's group the Wiggles from its founding in 1991 to 2012, and was also in the 1980s and 1990s pop band the Cockroaches. He was the oldest member of the original Wiggles line up. Early life and education The son of Chinese parents who owned a large retail store in Casino, New South Wales, Fatt had aspirations to become an architect, and earned a Bachelor of Arts in industrial design. Anthony Field described him as a \\"bush kid\\" who \\"first learned to let his keyboard do most of the talking\\". He opened a public address equipment business with his brother in Sydney when he began playing keyboard for the rockabilly band the Roadmasters, and was recruited by Anthony and Paul Field to join the Cockroaches. The Wiggles After the Cockroaches disbanded in the early 1990s, Anthony Field asked Fatt, who was renovating his house at the time, to help them record the Wiggles' first album in 1991. Fatt reported, \\"I got this call from Anthony: 'Hello, Anthony. Go away, go away. I'm not interested,' you know. He's always got these ideas for things. He said, 'I've got this idea, come down to the studio.'\\" Fatt's response to Field's request was, \\"Sure but how long will it take?\\" Field reported that as Fatt had done for the Cockroaches, he was \\"a musical backbone for the Wiggles\\". As a Wiggle, Fatt wore a purple skivvy. He originated the Wiggles character Henry the Octopus and has occasionally voiced Wags the Dog, and performed those voices when other actors took over the roles. Fatt reported that it took twelve months to \\"learn the language of preschool\\", including addressing children using the inclusive \\"everybody\\", instead of \\"boys and girls\\", and that the Wiggles' first performances were traumatic for him because he was not used to being around children. Fatt's schtick was sleeping at odd times, which led to a Wiggles catchphrase and the title of one of their songs, \\"Wake Up, Jeff!\\" Fatt was the oldest Wiggle and was well known for his \\"laid-back personality\\", which according to Field, made him \\"invaluable company on the road\\".Field, p. 48 As Sam Moran has said, when referring to the development of the Wiggles' shticks, \\"Jeff really does fall asleep\\", and Fatt reported, \\"The irony is I'm a very light sleeper in the nighttime. I will invariably have a snooze before the show\\". Fatt was the only member of the Wiggles without a background in early childhood education; he stated that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his shtick, \\"because it was a way of getting me involved in the shows without actually having to do anything\\". Field claimed Fatt's shtick endeared Fatt to their audiences and called it \\"a simple audience participation and interaction gag we've done since the start of the group\\". Kathleen Warren, the group's former professor at Macquarie University and their consultant for their shows and DVDs, believed that the shtick empowered children, and Paul Field reported that children in the Wiggles' audience felt \\"great excitement\\" and were disappointed if not given the opportunity to help Jeff in this way. Anthony Field reported that although in the early days of the group, they took turns falling asleep, it became Fatt's shtick because \\"it was a perfect fit\\".Field, p. 49 Since 1990, Fatt (whose nickname is \\"Fatty\\")Field, p. 14 has taken a photo a day documenting the most eventful thing that has happened to him. He was \\"a keen surfer\\". On 17 May 2012 it was announced that Fatt along with Greg Page and Murray Cook, would be retiring at the end of the year. Wiggles cast member Lachlan Gillespie replaced him as the purple Wiggle. Fatt and the others are expected to remain involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. He continues to perform in reunion shows. In July 2020, he appeared with the other classic Wiggles in The Soul Movers music video \\"Circles Baby\\".https://au.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-soul-movers-live- original-wiggles-lineup-13187/ In September 2020, following the announcement of the birth of Gillespie's daughters, Lulu and Lottie, it was announced Gillespie would take some time away from the group in order to spend time with them. As a result, Fatt decided to temporarily replace Gillespie to film The Wiggly World Of Dance Classes, a four-part series. Awards In what Paul Field called \\"one of the highlights of their 15 years of being together\\", Fatt, along with the original members of the Wiggles, was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Australian Catholic University in 2006. All five members of the band were awarded another honorary doctoral degree in 2009 from Macquarie University. Fatt, along with the other three original Wiggles, was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in January 2010 \\"for service to the arts, particularly children's entertainment, and to the community as a benefactor and supporter of a range of charities.\\" Fatt also received an ARIA Hall of Fame Award with the Wiggles in 2011. Health In early July 2011, Fatt underwent heart surgery after feeling unwell for several weeks and having a blackout. He was diagnosed as having a heart arrhythmia and was fitted with a defibrillator at Sydney's Mater Hospital. His surgery was \\"urgent but routine\\" and Fatt was expected to recover completely. He missed the summer US tour as a result, after not missing a show in 20 years. References Bibliography * Field, Anthony and Greg Truman. (2012). How I Got My Wiggle Back: A Memoir of Healing.

It is located in the eastern part of the Suwa≈Çki Lake Area (), on the Marycha river (Seina in Lithuanian for which the town was named), being a tributary of the Czarna Ha≈Ñcza. As of 1999 it had almost 6,500 permanent inhabitants, with a strong seasonal increase during the tourist season.  Etymology  According to a legend, the town of Sejny was started by three of the old knights of King of Poland Jogaila, who after the Battle of Grunwald granted them a land parcel in what is now Sejny. The three were very old and named the settlement Seni, which is a Lithuanian word for Old Men. The name was purportedly given to the city of Sejny. However, no archaeological findings or documents support this legend. The name is Yotvingian in origin. The linguist Jerzy Nalepa has proposed that the nearby river name Sejna (now Marycha) and the city name are Yotvingian. This conclusion is based on two features: # the presence of West Baltic \\"s\\" (vs. modern Lith. \\"≈°\\") # retention of the diphthong \\"ei\\". Cognates include Pol. siano and Lith. ≈°ienas, both meaning \\"hay\\".  History   Early history  In the early Middle Ages the area comprising modern Sejny was inhabited by the Yotvingians, one of the Baltic tribes closely related to Lithuanians that had arrived in the area in the first millennium.  Late Middle Ages  There was ongoing strife for the area since the 13th century between the Teutonic Order and Lithuania. This resulted in the area being almost completely depopulated, with only a few of the indigenous Yotvingians surviving. The first written record of the area where the town now lies dates to 1385, noting an armed raid of the German knights from Castrum Leicze () to Merkinƒó.  In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  After the Treaty of Melno in 1422, Teutonic-Lithuanian border was determined, people began to return to the forests in the area. New roads were paved, with one of them, the road leading from Ber≈æininkai through Seinai to Merkinƒó, becoming a notable trade route. = 16th century = In 1510 Micha≈Ç Pac became the governor of the area, founding the settlement of Ber≈æininkai (). This started a period of the rapid development of the former Yotvingian lands. On December 22, 1522, Sigismund I the Old ordered the voivode of Podlaskie Janusz Kostewicz to grant half of a square mile of land at the shores of the river Sejna (now called Marycha) to hetman Iwan Wi≈õniowiecki. On May 21 of the following year, Kostewicz described the parcel in a letter to the king and soon afterwards Wi≈õniowiecki became the owner of the area. A new wooden manor was built in the place where the Sejna river reached Sejny lake and soon settlement started. Wi≈õniowiecki, a mighty magnate from Volhynia, never came there personally and instead appointed his governor to rule the hamlet. In 1593 the town was sold by his great-granddaughter Anna, wife of voivode of Witebsk Miko≈Çaj Sapieha, to a local noble Jerzy Grodzi≈Ñski for sixty times the amount of 10.000 grosz in silver. Until 1602 he transferred the unnamed village (sometimes referred to as Sejna) into a town called Juriewo, after its founder. However, the name did not stick and instead it was named Sejny. The town's market was located on a small hill overlooking the right bank of the river, near the original wooden manor. It was located right on the earlier trade route. South of the town, a new road leading to Grodno was created and the new settlement received significant income from trading. The founder of the town financed a Catholic St George's church and established a new parochy. =17th century= Baroque Church of the Visitation Jerzy Grodzi≈Ñski died without heirs. On May 16, 1602, he had bequeathed all of his properties to the Dominican monastery in Vilnius. He died on 12 January 1603 and on 4 June 1603 king Sigismund III Vasa accepted the testament. In 1610 the monks started the construction of a large monastery there. The construction of the monastery was finished in 1619 and by 1632 a new church was built nearby, devoted to Holy Mary, Saint George and Saint Hyacinth. The town developed slowly, mostly due to low traffic on the old trade routes to Grodno. In the 17th century, another church was built, consecrated to the Holy Spirit. A printing press was started and most probably a hospital. The monastery was being constantly expanded, becoming one of the most notable examples of a fortified monastery in Central Europe. War with Swedish Empire, known as The Deluge, was disastrous for the town. In 1656, after a major battle took place nearby, the town was captured by the Swedes, looted and burnt to the ground. The monastery survived and after the war ended, the monks returned to the town and started its reconstruction. On November 8, 1670, the king Michael I granted the town the privilege of organizing a market and fair once a week. This helped the monks to repopulate the town with new settlers, mostly from over-populated Masovia. = 18th century = In the early 18th century the Great Northern War put an end to the prosperity, as the town was pillaged by several armies in a row. The soldiers also carried two consecutive plagues to the town. Sejny town hall At the same time, the area was being populated, and numerous settlements were founded not far from Sejny. In 1715 the Camedulian monks founded a village and a monastery, which developed into what is now the town of Suwa≈Çki. Other towns founded in that period were Pu≈Ñsk, August√≥w, Jeleniewo and Krasnopol. With increased prosperity in the town, the Dominicans started the reconstruction of Sejny, leading to the construction of notable examples of baroque architecture. The church received a new fa√ßade, in 1770 a new town hall was built, and in 1778 a new marketplace and a new Wooden synagogue were opened.  Prussian rule 1794-1807  Under the Partitions of Poland, Sejny became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1794 and was made part of the New East Prussia.  Duchy of Warsaw  Initially neglected, in 1807 the town became part of the Duchy of Warsaw and a major administrative centre.  In the Russian Empire  After the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815, the town was transferred to Congress Poland, retaining its status as a seat of a powiat. In 1818 the bishopric was moved to Sejny from Wigry and Sejny Priest Seminary was established in 1826. The town continued to prosper, despite a major fire that had struck the city earlier that year. The population also grew rapidly.Sejny Synagogue, known as the White synagogue Prosperity declined in the latter part of the 19th century. During the November Uprising and the January Uprising the town's inhabitants took part in the struggles against Imperial Russia. After the massacres of Polish protesters committed by the Russians in Warsaw in 1861, Polish processions and clashes with Russian soldiers took place in Sejny.Katalog miejsc pamiƒôci powstania styczniowego w wojew√≥dztwie podlaskim, Towarzystwo Opieki nad Zabytkami Oddzia≈Ç Bia≈Çystok, Bia≈Çystok, 2013, p. 9 (in Polish) The Sejny County was one of the counties in which the insurgent unit of operated during the January Uprising in 1863.Katalog miejsc pamiƒôci powstania styczniowego w wojew√≥dztwie podlaskim, p. 12 Sejny was one of the sites of Russian executions of Polish insurgents during the January Uprising.Katalog miejsc pamiƒôci powstania styczniowego w wojew√≥dztwie podlaskim, p. 15 There is a memorial at the place of the executions.Katalog miejsc pamiƒôci powstania styczniowego w wojew√≥dztwie podlaskim, p. 59 After the uprisings the town was deprived of its privileges and neglected by Russia. The lack of railway development by the Russian Empire prevented the town from developing industry. Sejny continued as a small provincial town and a local centre of trade and commerce. Nonetheless, the Neo-baroque Sejny Synagogue was built in the 1860s, now used as a cultural center after the deportation and murder of the Jews in the Holocaust during World War II. 20th century = World War I = During World War I, in 1915 the town was captured by Germany. Initially their forces made it part of the Ober Ost military administration, but Germany planned this area to be one of the puppet states in Central Europe in accordance with their Mitteleuropa plan. Following Germany's defeat in the war, the German garrisons started to withdraw from the area. = Polish-Lithuanian War = On May 8, 1919 the administration over the town was passed to the Lithuania which recently declared its independence. This led to tensions between Lithuania and Poland (which also declared independence around the same time), as both claimed the area. Under pressure from the Conference of Ambassadors (later to become the League of Nations), Poland initially backed down on the issue, but, on August 22, 1919, on the day German troops withdrew from the area, Polish Military Organization organized a military action against the Lithuanian rule in what became known as the Sejny Uprising (or \\"Seinai Revolt\\"). Sejny changed hands several times. During these battles, both sides used repressive measures - the Lithuanians had deported a few families, while the Polish had closed all Lithuanian schools.Krzysztof Buchowski, Polish-Lithuanian Relations in Seinai Region at the Turn of the nineteenth and twentieth Centuries . LCAS Annuals, vol. XXIII On August 28, the uprising ended with a Polish success, and the town became a part of Poland. After Poles acquired the town and its surroundings, the Lithuanian population of the region was subject to various repressions, which included evictions; banning the use of Lithuanian language in public; closures of Lithuanian organizations, schools and press; and confiscation of property.Poles Attacked By Lithuanians. Walter Duranty, New York Times, September 6, 1920. Accessed on October 26, 2007. The Polish historian Piotr ≈Åossowski has suggested that both sides exaggerated repressions they suffered during the uprising and its aftermath in order to elicit internal and external support. Piotr ≈Åossowski, Konflikt polsko- litewski 1918‚Äì1920, KsiƒÖ≈ºka i Wiedza, 1995, , p.68 Sejny town at the time had approximately 2500 inhabitants. Bronius Kviklys, M≈´s≈≥ Lietuva Vol.3,1991 in p. 457 Polish cavalry parade in Sejny in the interbellum Only a year later, the town was captured by the Bolshevik Russia in the course of the Polish- Bolshevik War. To ensure the right of passage through Lithuanian territory, on 12 July 1920 the Soviet authorities signed the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920, in which it ceded the area to Lithuania. On July 19 the Lithuanians recaptured the town. After the Battle of Warsaw the Bolshevik forces were defeated and the Polish Army attacked the Lithuanian forces. As the Paris Peace Conference established the Polish-Lithuanian border roughly correspondent to the status quo ante bellum, the Lithuanian forces were forced to withdraw from the town and on 31 August 1920 the town once again passed to Polish hands. However, the Lithuanian authorities still claimed the area and Lithuanian successfully counterattacked on September 2. However, the Polish Army recaptured the town on September 9. The following day the last of the Lithuanian units retreated to the other side of the border and on October 7 a cease fire agreement was signed, leaving Sejny on the Polish side of the border. = Interbellum = During the interbellum, the town continued to be claimed by Lithuania. In 1925 the bishopric and the powiat status were removed, but the town remained a notable centre of not only trade and commerce but also wood and furniture production, gaining profits from the nearby forests. = World War 2 = Mass grave of Poles murdered by the Germans on April 24, 1940 During the invasion of Poland, which started World War II, in 1939 the town was first captured by the Soviet Union on September 24, 1939. Sejny was severely pillaged and then on 13 October 1939 transferred to Nazi Germany. It remained occupied by the Germans until August 1944. Poles were subjected to mass arrests and executions, and the local Jewish community was almost completely destroyed. The Germans carried out a massacre of 10 Poles at the local cemetery in 1939.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion, IPN, Warszawa, 2009, p. 234 (in Polish) In April 1940 the Germans carried out mass arrests of 150 Poles, 10 of whom were publicly executed at the market square on April 24, 1940, and the w√≥jt of Gmina Sejny was murdered in Prudziszki on April 26, 1940.Wardzy≈Ñska, p. 235 On 31 August 1944 the town was captured by the Red Army and soon afterwards it was delivered to the new Soviet-controlled communist authorities of Poland. = Cold War = After the war, the local population, largely depleted during the war, started to recuperate. A notable influx of Poles resettled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union allowed for fast reconstruction of the town. In 1956, after the administrative reform of that year, Sejny once again became a seat of a powiat. Although it was cancelled in 1975, the new administrative division of Poland passed in 1999 reinstituted it. Depopulation may ultimately again threaten the present local and regional administrative organisation. Modern Sejny Currently, Sejny is a notable centre of trade, production and tourism, with thousands of tourists visiting the town every year. A dairy and a cheese factory are located in the town, as well as numerous hotels. Sejny is also a notable centre of the cultural life of the Lithuanian minority in Poland. It is the main seat of the Lithuanian Society of Poland and the Au≈°ra bi-weekly. Lithuanians constituted 7.9% (474) of the city's inhabitants in 2002 and 20.2% (4,271) of the population in the Sejny County (powiat) in 2011. Due to that, there is a Lithuanian consulate there, as well as a Lithuanian schooling complex (kindergarten, elementary school, gymnasium). Owing to a lost dispute about payment for the town's sewage treatment works, the town is financially crippled by debt. Mayor Arkadiusz Nowalski is fighting to rescue the town, which lacks sufficient collateral for necessary investment or to seek European development funding. Although mayor, with his 2014 shock win against the incumbent, he does not have the majority support of the council.

He was ordained by Saint Mark the Evangelist, and was also the first convert Mark won to Christianity in the region.Atiya, Aziz S.. The Coptic Encyclopedia. New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1991. . Connection with Saint Mark The Healing of Anianus by Cima da Conegliano As Mark was entering Rakotis, a suburb of Alexandria, after his trip from Cyrene to the Pentapolis, the strap of his sandal fell off. He found a cobbler, Anianus, to repair it. While he was working on the sandal, the awl slipped in Anianus' hand, piercing it. Anianus cried '\\"Heis ho Theos\\" (\\"God is one\\") in response to the pain. Mark took the opportunity to preach the Gospel of Christianity to him, at the same time reportedly miraculously healing Anianus of his wound. How it was that Anianus was a monotheist in Alexandria is a matter of conjecture. Some have suggested that he was himself a Jew, or perhaps a pagan native who had come under the influence of the wealthy Jewish community, and learned his monotheistic beliefs there. Others have held that Anianus was a noble, although this does seem to be contrary to the documents available. In any event, Mark was invited to Anianus's house, where he taught Anianus' family the Gospel and baptized them all. A large number of natives of the area were quickly converted by Mark and his followers, causing those citizens who did not convert to feel obliged to defend their local gods against the new faith. Ordination of Anianus Mark, the outsider, decided it might be best if he were to leave the area for a while. He ordained Anianus to be bishop in his absence. He also ordained three presbyters and seven deacons at the same time, charging the group of them with watching over the church of the area in his absence. Mark was gone for a period of two years, during which time he is said to have gone to Rome, Aquileia, and the Pentapolis, preaching, performing miracles, and winning converts to Christianity at each location. On Mark's return, he found that the church in Alexandria had grown significantly, and that they were able to build a church for themselves at Bucolia on the shore of the eastern harbor of Alexandria, also known as the Portus Magnus of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Following the martyrdom of Mark on the 30th day of Baramudah, Anianus became the patriarch of the church in Alexandria. He would remain in that capacity for over seventeen and one-half years. During that time, the number of Christians in the area grew significantly, and Anianus ordained new priests and deacons for the growing church. The extent of the evangelization they performed is unknown, although it has been thought by some that it was done at least somewhat covertly, given the hostility the pagan population demonstrated to the new faith. Anianus died in bed, and was buried next to Mark at the church in Baucalis. Controversy It is a matter of some dispute whether Anianus was the first or second Patriarch of Alexandria. The Catholic Church and some others hold that Anianus was the first patriarch. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria holds that Mark was the first patriarch of Alexandria, making Anianus second. Veneration He is regarded as a saint, with a feast day of 25 April in the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church.

Format The format of the program is composed of stories of interest from throughout the entertainment industry, exclusive set visits, first looks at upcoming film and television projects, and one-on-one interviews with actors, musicians and other entertainment personalities and newsmakers. Logo used until 2014; all on-air logos used since 1994 are based on the lead \\"E\\" and end \\"T\\" in \\"Entertainment\\" seen in the original 1981 logo, but have solely used the abbreviated \\"ET\\" name. A one-hour weekend edition, ET Weekend (known as Entertainment This Week until September 1991), originally offered a recap of the week's entertainment news, with most or all episodes later transitioning to center (either primarily or exclusively) around some sort of special theme; though the weekend edition now utilizes either format depending on the episode, most commonly, the format of those broadcasts consists of replays of stories that were shown during the previous week's editions. ET Radio Minute, a daily radio feature, is syndicated by Westwood One. As of 2018, the program's weekday broadcasts are anchored by Kevin Frazier, while the weekend editions are anchored by Cameron Mathison and Nischelle Turner. In November 2018, CBS launched a free, 24-hour over-the-top streaming service known as ET Live; it features the correspondents from the linear show with expanded coverage of entertainment news. It is available via web browsers, apps, and most recently, the free streaming service Pluto TV (which added ET Live to its channel lineup in November 2019). History In its early years from its 1981 inception, Entertainment Tonight ‚Äì following a local newscast-style format ‚Äì consisted primarily of coverage of the latest movies, music and television releases and projects. They signed an exclusive agreement to cover the wedding of convicted child molester Mary Kay Letourneau, who married the student she had an affair with, Vili Fualaau; and attorney Howard K. Stern, who represented Daniel Birkhead in the paternity case of the late Anna Nicole Smith's daughter Dannielynn. ET has also aired exclusive stories related to Anna Nicole Smith, including coverage of her funeral, and her surviving daughter. In 1996, actor George Clooney decided to boycott Entertainment Tonight to protest the presence of intrusive paparazzi after Hard Copy did an expos√© about his love life, violating an agreement that he had with Paramount, which produced and syndicated both shows. In a letter he sent to Paramount, Clooney stated that he would encourage his friends to do the same. On September 8, 2008, Entertainment Tonight began broadcasting in high definition; concurrently, the program moved its production and studio operations from its longtime home at Stage 28 on the Paramount Pictures studio lot to Stage 4 at CBS Studio Center, one of the final steps involving the incorporation of Paramount's former syndication arm, Paramount Domestic Television, into CBS' distribution arms and the adoption of the then-new CBS Television Distribution name, which all took place following the breakup of CBS and the original Viacom into separate companies in December 2005. After pressure via a social media campaign by actors Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, ET announced in February 2014 that it would no longer accept footage or pictures of the children of celebrities from paparazzi photographers. This show is the longest-running syndicated show, surpassing Soul Train, which had a 37-year run.

History The concept of the IDSA/ESA arose from the controversies that the violence depicted in the video game Mortal Kombat drew. This led to a United States Congress hearing in late 1993 where the video game industry was put under scrutiny for the level of violence in games like Mortal Kombat and Night Trap. During these hearings, Sega and Nintendo blamed the other for the situation, citing differences in how they would rate the content of games for players. Following the hearings, Congressman Joe Lieberman proposed the Video Game Ratings Act of 1994, which would have set a government-overseen commission to establish a ratings system for video games, and threatened to push it through legislation if the video game industry did not voluntarily come up with one of its own. Recognizing the threat of government oversight, the companies decided to establish the IDSA to be a unified front and represent all video game companies at this level, and subsequently developed the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) to create a voluntary but standardized rating approach to video games. In July 1994, IDSA representatives returned to Congress to present the ESRB, which Congress accepted and became the standard for the American industry. The IDSA formally renamed itself to the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) on July 21, 2003. The renaming was made to reflect that the associated companies were primarily in the realm of creating entertainment software across ranges of devices, and the new name was selected to more clearly define the industry.

In the end ESA opted to elect Pierre-Louis as the permanent president and CEO in May 2019. Activities In addition to overseeing the ESRB, the ESA organizes the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). After the IDSA's formation, the video game industry had become concerned over the treatment they had received at recent Consumer Electronic Shows and were seeking another trade show venue. The IDSA partnered with International Data Group (IDG) to organize the first E3, held in May 1995 in Los Angeles. The first E3 proved more successful than originally expected, and the IDSA negotiated with the IDG to take ownership of E3 and its intellectual property, with the IDG serving to help handle execution of the event. In a 1997 interview, IDSA president Doug Lowenstein said E3 is also the primary source of income for the IDSA. The ESA leads in confronting legislation that would be harmful to the video game industry, particularly related to video game rating controversies under the ESRB, and encouraging legislation that would be beneficial to the industry. Of note, the ESA was one plaintiff in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n, a Supreme Court case that judged that video games were protected works under the First Amendment in 2012, and was instrumental in getting entertainment software included in the Information Technology Agreement of 1996. The ESA also engages in government lobbying at the state and federal level.

This is typically done through sending takedown or cease and desist notices to sites hosting infringing work, and working with search engines like Google to delist sites that host infringing files. They also work with law enforcement agencies to train agents how to handle copyright infringement. ESA has spoken in favor of the loot box mechanics, arguing that it does not constitute gambling. On August 3, 2019, it had been found that an unsecured list of personal attendee data was publicly accessible from the ESA's site. The list contained the information of over 2000 people, most of them being the press and social media influencers that had attended E3 2019. ESA removed the list after its public visible was found, and apologized for allowing the information to become public. However, using similar techniques to access the 2019 data, users found similar dates for over 6000 attendees of past E3 events still available on user-authenticated portions of their website; these too were subsequently pulled by ESA once notified.  List of ESA members  , the following companies are members of the ESA Not-renewed membership known cases Several companies opted not to renew their membership in the ESA in May 2008, including Activision, Vivendi Games, LucasArts and id Software. This followed from the ESA's option to change in the E3 format in 2007, which significantly reduced the size and venue due to complaints from the 2006 event, but ultimately led to much lower visibility and impact on the industry. The move cost the ESA $5 million and required them raising dues for members in the following year. Crave Entertainment left the ESA in June 2008 due to its pending acquisition by Fillpoint LLC.

They constitute the centre piece of TCM's general concept of how the human body works. The term z√†ng () refers to the organs considered to be yin in nature ‚Äì Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung, Kidney ‚Äì while f«î () refers to the yang organs ‚Äì Small Intestine, Large Intestine, Gall Bladder, Urinary Bladder, Stomach and SƒÅnjia≈ç. Each z√†ng is paired with a f«î, and each pair is assigned to one of the W«î X√≠ng. The z√†ng-f«î are also connected to the twelve standard meridians ‚Äì each yang meridian is attached to a f«î organ and each yin meridian is attached to a z√†ng. They are five systems of Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung, Kidney. To highlight the fact that the z√†ng-f«î are not equivalent to the anatomical organs, their names are often capitalized. Anatomical organs To understand the z√†ng-f«î it is important to realize that their concept did not primarily develop out of anatomical considerations. The need to describe and systematize the bodily functions was more significant to ancient Chinese physicians than opening up a dead body and seeing what morphological structures there actually were. Thus, the z√†ng-f«î are functional entities first and foremost, and only loosely tied to (rudimentary) anatomical assumptions. Yin/yang and the Five Elements Each z√†ng-f«î organ has a yin and a yang aspect, but overall, the z√†ng organs are considered to be yin, and the f«î organs yang.by citation from the Huangdi Neijing's Suwen: ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äò‚Äô[Within the human body's zang-fu, there's yin and yang; the zang are yin, the fu are yang]. As seen at: Since the concept of the z√†ng-f«î was developed on the basis of W«î X√≠ng philosophy, they are incorporated into a system of allocation to one of five elemental qualities (i.e., the Five Elements or Five Phases). The z√†ng-f«î share their respective element's allocations (e.g., regarding colour, taste, season, emotion etc.) and interact with each other cyclically in the same way the Five Elements do: each z√†ng organ has one corresponding z√†ng organ that it enfeebles, and one that it reinforces. The correspondence between z√†ng-f«î and Five Elements are stipulated as: * Fire () = Heart () and Small Intestine () (and, secondarily, SƒÅnjia≈ç [, ‚Äò‚ÄôTriple Burner‚Äò‚Äô] and Pericardium []) * Earth () = Spleen () and Stomach () * Metal () = Lung () and Large Intestine () * Water () = Kidney () and Bladder () * Wood () = Liver () and Gall Bladder () Details The z√†ng organs' essential functions consist in manufacturing and storing q√¨ and blood (and, in the case of the Kidney, essence). The f«î organs' main purpose is to transmit and digest (‰º†Âåñ, ) substances (like waste, food, etc.). Zang Each z√†ng has a corresponding \\"orifice\\" it \\"opens\\" into. This means the functional entity of a given z√†ng includes the corresponding orifice's functions (e.g. blurry vision is primarily seen as a dysfunction of the Liver z√†ng as the Liver \\"opens\\" into the eyes). In listing the functions of the z√†ng organs, TCM regularly uses the term \\"governing\\" (, ) ‚Äì indicating that the main responsibility of regulating something (e.g. blood, q√¨, water metabolism etc.) lies with a certain z√†ng. Although the z√†ng are functional entities in the first place, TCM gives vague locations for them ‚Äì namely, the general area where the anatomical organ of the same name would be found. One could argue that this (or any) positioning of the z√†ng is irrelevant for the TCM system; there is some relevance, however, in whether a certain z√†ng would be attributed to the upper, middle or lower jia≈ç. =Heart= The Heart: *\\"Stores\\" (, ) 2006, chapter 1.2.2. the sh√©n (, \\"Aggregate Soul\\", usually translated as mind), paired with small intestines *Governs xuƒõ (blood) and vessels/meridians *Opens into the tongue *Reflects in facial complexion Pericardium Since there are only five z√†ng organs but six yin channels, the remaining meridian is assigned to the Pericardium.

This organ contains a waxy liquid called spermaceti and is involved in the generation of sound.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559404/spermaceti-organ Spermaceti Organ from Britannica In the modern sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), the spermaceti organ is far larger in proportion to the animal‚Äôs body than what would be explained by simple allometry, and the evolution of the organ has caused changes in basal skull morphology, which may implicate tradeoffs were made that compromised the functionality of other nearby features. The high investment in this organ suggests that the organ must have adaptively advantageous functionality. However, the nature of its function hasn‚Äôt been clearly understood historically. The two prevailing hypotheses proposed regarding the spermaceti organ‚Äôs function are that 1) it assists in controlling buoyancy via manipulation of the contained spermaceti oil's temperature and, in consequence, its density, facilitating deep diving by cooling and surfacing by warming, as well as allowing the animal to remain motionless at great depth and 2) it essentially functions as sonar, aiding the whale in echolocation. The hypotheses that the spermaceti organ is involved in buoyancy manipulation has been challenged by many authors, with the following points raised as problematic: the change in density that could be achieved by manipulation of spermaceti oil temperature would likely have a negligible impact on the animal‚Äôs overall buoyancy; the anatomical features that would be needed for heat exchange with the spermaceti organ don‚Äôt appear to be present; a mechanism of temperature regulation would necessitate high physical exertion while at great depth, which deep-diving animals tend to avoid; sperm whales appear to be highly active during dives, countering the suggestion that buoyancy manipulation would be advantageous because of its benefit in remaining motionless while diving; and the evolution of the spermaceti organ with buoyancy as a selective pressure would be very difficult and is unlikely due to the fact that the organ wouldn‚Äôt have any impact on buoyancy until it became extremely large in proportion to the body. Thus, the hypothesis that the spermaceti organ is an adaptation aiding in echolocation is generally the best accepted one. Under this hypothesis, the spermaceti organ assists in echolocation for the purpose of foraging activity during deep dives, allowing the whale to manipulate the directionality and power of output sound waves for improved sensory perception of its surroundings and increased ability to actively capture prey. While nasal complex morphology is believed to be homologous in all of the echolocating Odontoceti (toothed whales), the hypertrophied quality of the sperm whale's nose, which contains the greatly enlarged spermaceti organ can be interpreted as an adaptation for deep diving activity uniquely evolved in the Physeteroidea. The spermaceti organ in sperm whales is shaped like an elongated barrel and sits on top of the whale's melon. Historically, the spermaceti oil found within it was used in a variety of products ‚Äì including lamp oils, candles, and lubricants ‚Äì providing the economic basis for the sperm whaling industry. A sperm whale may contain as much as 1,900 litres of this oil.https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19720017437.pdf  References  Category:Cetacean anatomy ","title":"Spermaceti organ"},{"id":"642604","text":"Blantyre () is Malawi's centre of finance and commerce, and its second largest city, with an enumerated 800,264 inhabitants . It is sometimes referred to as the commercial and industrial capital of Malawi as opposed to the political capital, Lilongwe. It is the capital of the country's Southern Region as well as the Blantyre District.  History  Blantyre government offices in 1904. Mandala House, Blantyre's oldest building Blantyre was founded in 1876 through the missionary work of the Church of Scotland. It was named after Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, birthplace of the explorer David Livingstone. Blantyre's historical importance is rivaled by no other Malawian city. It has many historic and cultural heritage resources, which constitute a vital part of the city and are crucial to its identity, cultural and social well-being and attractiveness to business and tourism. It became a British consular in 1883 and attained municipality status by 1895, making it Malawi's oldest municipality. By the time of World War I, Blantyre was diverse with Africans from neighbouring districts as well as South Asian traders. The city's status as Malawi's centre of commerce and industry began through its role as a centre for colonial trade in ivory. Thus, Blantyre quickly established itself as a crossroads for trade in Southern Africa. Today the city is Malawi's main manufacturing core including \\"shoe manufacturing, corn (maize) milling, brewing, soft drink production, baking, printing, and tobacco manufacturing\\". From 1876 to 1905, urban development in Blantyre was confined to three distinct areas within 2 km of each other: Blantyre Mission at HHI, Mandala (European commercial venture), and the government zone and commercial centre triangle marked by Haile Selassie Road, Glyn Jones Road and Hannover Street. In Limbe development started in 1906 following the establishment of the Shire Highlands Railways Company headquarters and repair and servicing facilities and Imperial Tobacco Group (ITG) packaging and tobacco grading factory nearby. As a result of the establishment of these large operations, easy accessibility and flat topography, Limbe experienced a development boom of Indian wholesale and retail shops. By 1910 Limbe town surpassed Blantyre town. Low- and medium- density housing for the European and Asian staff was in Mpingwe, ITG and Mudi in Limbe and in Mount Pleasant, Sunnyside, Namiwawa, Kabula and Mandala in Blantyre. The Indian shops included accommodation at the rear or on the top floor. High-density housing for the African workforce was far away except the Chiwembe compound in Limbe. The development history of Blantyre was principally dictated by piecemeal un-co-ordinated development as a result of individual and interest group decisions relating to evangelism, commerce, farming, industry and administration. Blantyre is named after the town in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, where the explorer David Livingstone was born. Livingstone's missionary endeavours saw the establishment of the St Michael and All Angels church. The church dates from 1891 and was famously built by a team of local workmen with no knowledge of European architecture or building techniques.Bsac Travel Club ‚Äì Malawi Urban development was further stimulated by the construction of the railway. In 1956 it was merged with its sister city, Limbe (7 miles (11 km) to the East, founded in 1909), to form one city. Here, it became the \\"headquarter of Malawi (then Nyasaland) Railways.\\" Blantyre City has a total of eight gazetted National Monuments, mostly buildings of historic importance. The City Assembly has nominated two sites for designation as National Monuments and another 23 sites for investigation with regard to their eligibility for designation as national and local monuments. Demographics Population Growth Ethnic Groups According to the 2018 census, the Lomwe are the largest ethnic group in the city with 39.59% of the population. The largest ethnic minority are the Ngoni with 19.12% of the population. Other minor ethnic groups include the Yao with 14.32%, Chewa with 9.34%, Sena with 5.74%, Mang'anja with 4.26%, Tumbuka with 4.01%, Tonga with 1.24%, Nyanja with 0.87%, Nkhonde with 0.34%, Lambya with 0.2%, Sukwa with only 0.02%, and other ethnic groups with 0.93% of the city's population. Religion The largest religious denomination in Blantyre City is Catholicism with 17.94% of the city. The largest religious minority is Church of Central Africa Presbyterian with 17.61%. Other minority religions include Seventh-day Adventist, Baptist, and Apostolic with 15.44% combined, Pentecostal with 9.75%, Anglican with 1.7%, other Christian with 24.33%, Islam with 10.11%, Traditional with only 0.08%, other religions with 2.41%, and no religion with 0.63% of the city.  Geography  Blantyre City, the largest commercial and industrial capital of Malawi, is in the Shire Highlands and geographical centre of the Southern Region of the country and lies 35¬∞ east of Greenwich Meridian and 15¬∞ 42\\" south of the Equator. It is a transport communications node with road, rail and air links to all parts of the country and neighbouring countries of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania. It covers an area of 228 km2. The city is classified as a 'National Urban Centre' within the designated six hierarchical levels system of urban centres of the country and is the regional administrative headquarters of the Southern Region. The geology of the city consists of two principal types of rocks of an ancient Basement Complex, a result of a process that took place during the late Pre-Cambrian period about 500 million years ago. The most extensive rock formation consists of pyroxene granulite gneiss that covers more than 50% of the city area, from the northwest to the east and extends in two small bands southward in the western part of the city. Syenitic gneiss accounts for about 40% covering the southern, western and north-eastern corner of the city and also in form of scattered small intrusions into the pyroxene granulite gneiss. In their unweathered state, both rock types are impervious hence poor aquifers, but they provide a valuable resource for road and building construction. Blantyre City is on the eastern edge of the southern branch of the Eastern African Rift, and thus some prominent faults occur within and in the vicinity of the city rendering it prone to earthquakes. The main faults and associated zones of deeply fractured bedrock run from the north of the city in a southwesterly direction and are potential aquifers for groundwater. Blantyre City lies in a hilly area; it has varied topography ranging from an elevation of about 780 to 1,612 metres above sea level. There are three main types of topographical features, which have major implications for the development of the city: the hills, plateau and ridge, and the natural drainage system. The most conspicuous and dominant physical features are the numerous hills found in all parts of the city. The main hills are the headwaters of several rivers and streams that originate and radiate from the city, forming a natural drainage system with nine distinct catchment areas: Likhubula, Lunzu, Mombezi and Khombwi, which drain the northern part of the city, and Mudi, Chisombezi, Limbe, Luchenza and Mwampanzi draining the middle and southern parts. Because of the hilly topography, these natural drainage channels are narrow and have steep sides and gradients. The plateau and ridge comprises all the land that is suitable for urban development including extensive relatively flat land, the mountain piedmonts and plains, and long narrow watersheds and strips of land that separate the rivers and streams. Its rather unconventional location has meant that Blantyre is surrounded by Mount Soche, Ndirande mountain, Chiradzulu mountain and Michiru Mountain, which constitute the Michiru Mountain Conservation Area.  Climate  The climate of Blantyre is classified by K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system as a Tropical climate, more specifically a tropical savanna climate (Aw) and is greatly influenced by its location in the tropical zone and altitude. The city experiences the tropical continental climate with two distinct seasons in the year (three proper seasons). The rainy season is from November to April, with continuing light cold showers locally known as chiperoni from the end of May to July. The dry season is from May to October. The mean annual rainfall is , of which about 80% falls within 3¬Ω months between November and March. The city is generally cool with mean monthly temperatures ranging from during the cool season (May to July) to during the hot season (September to November). There are two particularly uncomfortable spells of weather; the hottest season associated with high humidity soon before the onset of the first rains (end October to November), and the frost along rivers, mist and chilly showers and winds characteristic of the cold season in June and July.  Economy  Busy road in Blantyre City Blantyre City is the commercial and industrial capital. It is by far the major employment generator in the country and has the greatest multiplier effect on the urban economy. The city is Malawi's industrial centre with many manufacturing plants. There are eight designated industrial areas: Makata, Ginnery Corner, Maselema, Limbe, Chirimba, South Lunzu, Maone and Chitawira. Of these Makata, Ginnery Corner, Maselema, Limbe, Chirimba and Maone are actively hosting industries whilst South Lunzu is yet to be developed. The existing industrial sites are further categorised into heavy and light sites. Makata and Limbe, for example, are the sole heavy industrial sites hosting more than 30 companies. While Chirimba industrial area is designated a heavy industrial area, it is the least developed in terms of number of industries. Apart from Makata, Ginnery corner industrial site is another active site followed by Limbe and Maselema. The least are Chirimba and Maone industrial sites. Chitawira and Maselema are classic examples of light industrial areas.Blantyre City Assembly, 1999. All the industrial areas are located along the banks of the main rivers or streams of Blantyre city. Makata industrial area lies between Mudi and Nasolo streams whilst Ginnery Corner industrial area is along Mudi River. Maselema industrial area exists along the Naperi river and Chirimba stream hosts Chirimba industrial area. There are several rules for treatment of wastes in the industries,Local Government Act, 1982; Blantyre City Assembly, 1999 but disposal of untreated wastewater into drains and, subsequently, into the city's major streams is very common, thus posing a potential health and environmental risk to the people in Blantyre and downstream. Other sources of water pollution in the city such as run-offs from domestic and agricultural activities and vehicle emissionsLakudzala et al., 1999; Masamba and Chimbalanga, 2001, Sajidu et al, 2007 have been identified. Previous studies have indicated substantial heavy metal pollution in the city's water bodies including streams.Lakudzala et al., 1999; Sajidu et al., 2007; Kaonga et al., (2008) Major changes in industrial activities have occurred in the city including a decrease in volumes of wastewater generated by the David Whitehead company, which used to be a major contributor of wastewater effluent in Makata industrial area; change of ownership and wastewater management of Cold Storage Company; closure of the Shire Bus Line; doubling of wastewater generation from both Carlsberg and Chibuku Products due to increase in production and installation of some industrial pre-treatment plants such as at Chibuku, Plascon and Dulux. Manufacturing contributes approximately 14% to GDP. In the period 1996‚Äì1999 the sector showed 0% growth, partly due to the rapid liberalisation of markets exposing Malawi's manufacturers to competition from South Africa and Zimbabwe. The sector is still hampered by monopolistic behaviour (cotton), trade barriers, lack of access to capital, illegal imports, and unpredictable implementation or lack of implementation of existing bilateral trade agreements. The modern Multi- purpose hall at the Blantyre Mission The employment structure includes formal and informal sectors, together offering employment that is estimated to be between 50,000 and 55,000 jobs and absorbing 62% of the labour force. The formal sector employment consists of primary, secondary and tertiary industry sub-sectors, and the informal sector is principally small-scale business operations. The tertiary or services industry sub-sector is leading in terms of employment creation and importance to the economy of the city; it employs 26,074 people accounting for 56.5% of total formal employment. The secondary industry sub-sector employs 18,824 people principally in manufacturing and accounts for about 41% of the total employment. Information on informal sector activities is scanty or non-existent. But a recent study by Africon and field investigation under the Blantyre City Environmental City Profile, leads to the conclusion that it is a substantial and vibrant economy, offering employment to about 4,500 people who would otherwise be unemployed. Blantyre is home to the Malawi Stock Exchange located on Victoria Avenue, the heart of the city. It opened its doors in November 1996 and operates under the Capital Market Development Act 1990 and the Companies Act 1984. Before the listing of the first company, the major activities that were being undertaken were the provision of a facility for secondary market trading in Government of Malawi bonds, namely Treasury Bills and Local Registered Stocks. As Malawi's main economic and financial hub, the city plays host to an annual international trade fair each May. The event seeks to showcase the best of Malawian commerce, industry, agriculture and information technology and opened under a theme of \\"Building Productivity Capacity to Achieve Export Competitiveness\\" in 2007. According to the Mercer 2017 Cost of Living Rankings, Blantyre is the city with the fifth-lowest cost of living for expatriates in the world.\\"Mercer 2017 Cost of Living Rankings\\". Mercer. 2017. Sport facilities Malawi's largest stadium (Bingu International Stadium) is in the capital city of Lilongwe. Construction finished in 2016 and it is estimated to hold 70,000 people. The stadium is home to the Malawi Flames, the country's national football team. It is also used for track and field events as well as the majority of the important functions of the nation. Malawi's second-largest stadium, Kamuzu Stadium, which holds an estimated 60,000, is in Chichiri, Blantyre. Due to the age of the structure, however, it has been downsized to seat an estimated 25,000. International football games are played here as well as major Malawian events such as presidential inaugurations and Independence Day celebrations. Other sports centres are College of medicine sports complex, Blantyre Youth centre and the Chiwembe Sports complex.  Transport  Chileka International Airport Blantyre City is served by a road network totalling about consisting of six categories of roads: designated, collector, distributor, residential, industrial and access (in descending order of importance or traffic volumes). Private cars and minibuses have completely replaced buses as a means of public transport in the city. The taxis mainly found outside the city's top hotels, Mount Soche and Ryalls, provide an alternative mode of transport to the residents of Blantyre. Railway services contribute enormously to the city's status as Malawi's main commercial and industrial hub. The Central East African Railway, formerly Malawi Railways, has its headquarters in Limbe. The city has an important railway station on the Sena railway, which connects it by operating a connection between Blantyre to Nsanje, near the southern border with Mozambique, and connects Malawi with the Mozambican ports of Beira and Nacala; Mchinji, near the border with Zamibia; Salima and Lilongwe; and between Nkaya and Nayuchi on the eastern border with Mozambique, covering a total of . There is a rail-lake interchange station at Chipoka on Lake Malawi, from where Malawi Railways vessels operate services to other lake ports in Malawi. In September 2007, President Bingu wa Mutharika commissioned locomotives donated by the Taiwanese government that will provide passenger train services from Blantyre to other parts of the country. Prior to this, a government subsidised passenger rail service operated three times weekly from Blantyre to Makhanga and the border with Mozambique at Nayuchi. Chileka International Airport, located approximately nine miles from Blantyre city centre, has two runways and serves Blantyre with flights to South Africa, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Kenya, and domestic points. The airport is the second base for the country's flagship airline, Malawian Airlines. Chileka airport also houses important weather stations. In 2007, the Government of Malawi proposed expansion plans that are yet to be realised. In 2009 it was announced that the Government of Malawi was seeking partners for a $1 billion rehabilitation of the airport, which will include the construction of a new terminal building and the widening of the current runway. The city has coach services that run from the city centre and Wenela bus station to Lilongwe, Mzuzu and other African cities including Johannesburg and Harare.  Culture  The Mandala House is a historic building in Blantyre that was built in 1882 as a place of relaxation for the managers of the Mandala Trading Company. Inside there is a cafe, as well as the Society of Malawi Library and Archive. The Chichiri Museum is located in the city. Carlsberg Brewery is a location where visitors can try the country's favourite drink, the \\"Green\\". This drink was created by a Danish foreign minister who visited Malawi during the independence celebration in 1966.  Places of worship  St Michael and All Angels Church, Church of Central Africa Presbyterian Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Lutheran Church of Central Africa (Lutheran World Federation), Church of Central Africa Presbyterian (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Baptist Convention of Malawi (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Blantyre (Catholic Church).Britannica, Malawi, britannica.com, USA, accessed on 7 July 2019 There are also Muslim mosques.  Education  Malawi Polytechnic Blantyre City has a wide range of educational facilities comprising primary school, secondary school and tertiary education as well as pre-school. These are provided by the government, City Assembly, missionary institutions and the private sector. Tertiary education includes technical and higher learning institutions mostly in the Chichiri-Ginnery Corner area, Malawi Polytechnic, University of Malawi College of Medicine, Kamuzu College of Nursing, Blantyre School of Health Sciences and Malawi College of Accountancy, Telecommunications National and SADCC Multi-Country Training Schools, Technical School, Police Training School and Blantyre Teachers' College. Schools include Saint Andrews International Primary and Saint Andrews International High School, Central High School, Nyasa Junior Academy, St Patrick's Primary School, St Patrick's Academy, South End Secondary School, Phoenix Primary School, Hillview International Primary School in Limbe and Kalibu Academy.  Health  The health care delivery system in the city has both curative and preventative health care services, and this is provided through a network of hospitals and health centres/clinics that are distributed throughout different parts of the city. The government runs Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), the biggest referral hospital in the country, which has a total of 1,000 hospital beds, and the three private hospitals that have a total of 122 hospital beds. The 18 public clinics are run by the District Health Office in partnership with the Blantyre City Assembly and service Bangwe, Chigumula, Chilomoni, Chirimba, Limbe, Ndirande, Manyowe, Masala, Mapanga, Misesa, Mzedi, Nancholi, Nkolokoti, Ntenje, Ntonda, South Lunzu, Zingwangwa and Civic Centre. There are several clinics run by religious organisations where people receive paying health care services, and there are also clinics owned by statutory corporations/companies (serving their staff) such as ADMARC, Malawi Railways, Portland Cement, Lever Brothers, Tobacco Processors, and National Seed Company of Malawi. Following the liberalisation policy, the city has witnessed the establishment of many private clinics and hospitals (including Blantyre Adventist Hospital and Mwaiwathu PVT Hospital) that complement the few limited old facilities. The majority of these offer outpatient services while the few well-established ones offer both. Besides the city-based health services, many city residents make regular use of mission hospitals that are outside the city to the extent that these form part of the city's health delivery system (Mlambe Hospital and Nguludi). In addition, traditional healers (herbalists) and traditional birth attendants play an important role in providing health care to the city residents. The health delivery system of the city is grossly inadequate. The public hospital wards are very congested and long queues are characteristic of outpatient services. Mwaiwathu Private Hospital and Blantyre Adventist Hospital provide the best medical services in the city, with many residents of Lilongwe travelling to Blantyre to receive treatment from them. There is also the Beit CURE International Hospital, one of the very few hospitals where hip and knee replacement surgery can be done in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Every diagnosis is a \\"Pattern of disharmony\\" that affects one or more organs, such as \\"Spleen Qi Deficiency\\" or \\"Liver Fire Blazing\\" or \\"Invasion of the Stomach by Cold\\", and every treatment is centered on correcting the disharmony. The traditional Chinese model is concerned with function. Thus, the TCM Spleen is not a specific piece of flesh, but an aspect of function related to transformation and transportation within the body, and of the mental functions of thinking and studying. Indeed, the San Jiao or Triple Burner has no anatomical correspondent at all, and is said to be completely a functional entity. Chinese medicine and the model of the body is founded on the balance of the five elements: Earth, Metal, Water, Wood, and Fire. The elements are infinitely linked, consuming and influencing each other. Each element corresponds to different organs in the body. The organs act as representatives of the qualities of different elements, which impact the physical and mental body in respective ways. Each organ is categorized as either Yin or Yang. The energies of Yin and Yang are conflicting yet inter-reliant. When the two (Yin+Yang) forces are united they create a divine energy, which supports the flow of all life. Yin organs represent: femininity, coldness, compression, darkness, and submission. Yang organs represent: masculinity, expansion, heat, motion, and action. This duality (yin+yang) must be in balance or else disease of the mind and body will occur. Each organ governs energy channels, which distribute qi and connect all parts of the body to one another. These channels are called meridians.Dale, Cyndi, and Richard Wehrman. The Subtle Body: an Encyclopedia of Your Energetic Anatomy. Boulder, CO: Sounds True, 2009. Print  Wood  Wood is an element of growth, originality, creativity, and evolution. The Liver (1) and the Gallbladder (2) are the two wood-governed organs in the body. (1) The Liver, a Yin organ, influences emotional flexibility and the flow of energy on a cellular level. The organ has a strong impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the immune system along with storing the body's blood, a physical manifestation of one's true self. The Liver rules one's direction, vision, sense of self-purpose and opens into the eyes. Lastly, the Liver absorbs what is not digested and regulates blood sugar. Imbalance in the Liver can lead to great problems. Moodiness, anger, pain, poor self-esteem, lack of direction, addiction, and indecision are all associated with the Liver organ. Muscle spasms, numbness, tremors, eye diseases, hypertension, allergies, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis are also a result of Liver imbalances. The Liver Meridian begins on the big toe, runs along the inner leg through the genitals and ends on the chest. (2) The Gallbladder, a wood controlled Yang organ, governs decisiveness. The Gallbladder also stores bile. Imbalance of the Gallbladder can lead to indecisiveness along with obesity. The Gallbladder meridian begins at the outer edge of the eye, moves to the side of the head and trunk, and ends on the outside of the fourth toe.Reichstein, Gail. Wood Becomes Water: Chinese Medicine in Everyday Life. New York: Kodansha International, 1998. Print  Fire  Fire is an element of transformation, demolition, primal power, and divinity. (1)The Heart, (2) Small Intestine are the organs that fire controls. (3) Heart Protector, (4) Triple Heater are organs that secondary (ministerial) fire controls. (1) The Heart, a Yin organ, regulates the pulse, manifests in the face and tongue, and bridges the connection between the human and the celestial. Dysfunction of the Heart leads to insomnia, disturbance of the spirit, and an irregular pulse. The Heart Meridian begins in the chest moves to the inner aspect of the arm down to the palm of the hand and ends on the pinky. (2)The Small Intestine, a Yang organ, separates pure food and fluid essences from the polluted. The pure essences are distributed to the spleen while the polluted are sent to the bladder and the large intestine. Dysfunction of the Small Intestine can lead to bowel problems and a sense of distrust of one's self. The Small Intestine Meridian begins on the pinky, moves to the underside of the arm, up to the top of the shoulder blade, the neck, and ends on the front of the ear. (3) The Heart Protector, a Yin organ, shields the heart. It filters psychic inclinations and stabilizes emotions. A problem with the Heart Protector can lead to anxiety and heart palpitations. The Heart Protector Meridian begins on the chest, travels through the armpit to the arm and ends on the top of the middle finger. (4) The Triple Heater, a Yang organ, disperses fluids throughout the body and regulates the relationship between all organs. The Triple Heater Meridian begins on the ring finger, moves up the back of the arm to the side of the neck, goes around the ear and ends of the eyebrow.  Earth  Earth is an element of fertility, cultivation, femininity, and wrath. Earth governs the Spleen (1) and the Stomach (2). (1) The Spleen, a Yin organ, regulates digestion and the metabolism. It also holds the flesh and organs in their proper place while directing the movement of ascending fluids and essences. Mentally, the Spleen aids in concentration. Imbalance of the Spleen leads to chi deficiencies, diarrhea, organ prolapses, and headaches. The Spleen Meridian begins at the big toe, moves to the inner aspect of the leg, up to the front of the torso, and ends on the side of the trunk. (2) The Stomach, the most active yang organ, breaks down food and controls the descending movement of chi. Imbalance of the stomach leads to vomiting and belching. The Stomach Meridian begins below the eye, moves down the front of the face, torso, to the outer part of the leg, and ends on the third toe.  Metal  Metal is an element of purity, treasure, and masculinity. Metal controls the Lungs (1) and the Large Intestine (2). (1) The Lungs, a Yin organ, draws in pure chi by inhalation and eliminates impurities by exhalation. The lungs also disperse bodily fluids, defend the body from a cold or flu, govern the sense of smell, and open in the nose. Dysfunction of the Lungs leads to colds, the flu, phlegm, and asthma. The Lung Meridian begins at the chest moves to the inner arm, palm, and ends on the thumb. (2) The Large Intestine, a Yang organ, controls the removal of waste and feces. Imbalance in the Large Intestine leads to constipation, diarrhea and the inability to emotionally detach and let go. The Large Intestine Meridian begins on the forefinger, moves to the back of the arm, shoulder, side of the neck, cheek, and ends beside the opposite nostril.  Water  Water is an element of life and death. Water governs the Kidneys (1) and the Bladder (2). (1) The Kidneys, a Yin organ, are the source of all the Yin and Yang energy in the body. The Kidneys also govern the endocrine system, receive air from the lungs, govern bones, govern teeth, control water in the body, and store essence. Dysfunction of the Kidneys leads to deficiencies of Yin or Yang. It also leads to imbalanced hormones, weak bones, an impaired sex drive, and dizziness. Water in excess leads to bipolar disorder. Depressive episodes are characterized by Kidney Yin excess while manic episodes are characterized by Kidney Yang excess. The Kidney Meridian begins on the sole, moves up the inner leg to the groin, up the trunk, and ends under the collarbone. (2) The Bladder, a Yang organ, stores and removes fluid from the body by receiving Kidney chi. Imbalance of the Bladder leads to frequent or uncontrolled urination. The Bladder Meridian begins in the corner of the eye, moves down the back, and ends on the back of the knee. The Bladder also has another line, which starts alongside the previous line, moves down to the outer edge of the foot and ends on the small toe.

The region is home to many of Singapore's national monuments as it was historically the site where the city was first founded and the country's only UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Singapore Botanic Gardens, a tropical garden is also located in the region. Although the Central Area is by nature chiefly commercial especially the area in the Downtown Core, it also includes 335,400 residential housing units of various types, ranging from the HDB flats to more exclusive forms of private housing, such as bungalows. There are also 1000 hectares of green spaces, including parks, gardens and other recreational spaces linked by 19 km of park connectors. History Planning strategies URA Gallery. Planning considerations for the URA Master Plan 2003 involving the Central Region took into consideration its existing strengths. Besides being the core area for business and entertainment in the city, it contains districts steeped in history, various housing types, and numerous institutions for education and community life. Despite the highly built-up character, it still boasts a rich variety of parks, open spaces, and other recreational areas. It is also well connected to the rest of the city through extensive road and rail connections, plus an international gateway to the world via the Maritime ports. The Urban Redevelopment Authority envisaged the introduction of more homes of various types to the area, particularly in the Downtown Core which has been overwhelmingly commercial for the past decades. Supporting institutions and transport networks were upgraded or introduced to cater to the rising resident population in the area. In terms of business, the New Downtown@Marina Bay was developed into an extension of the existing central business district. To encourage greater land-use flexibility, new business zones and white zones were also introduced. Business and research activities were promoted at the new one-north and medical park within the grounds of the Singapore General Hospital at Outram Park. For recreation, plans were made to further extend the park connectors to new and existing parks in the region. New sporting facilities were also introduced, such as the redevelopment of the Kallang Sports Hub.

In the case of articles reprinted from wire services, the distributing organization is also included (though the originating one is not). Datelines are traditionally placed on the first line of the text of the article, before the first sentence. Format The location appears first, usually starting with the city in which the reporter has written or dispatched the report. City names are usually printed in uppercase, though this can vary from one publication to another. The political division and/or nation the city is in may follow, but they may be dropped if the city name is widely recognizable due to its size or political importance (a national capital, for instance). The date of the report comes after, followed by an em dash surrounded by spaces, and then the article. A typical newspaper dateline might read: :\`BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2 ‚Äî The outlook was uncertain today as ...\` The same story if pulled from the Associated Press (AP) wire might appear as: :\`BEIRUT (AP) ‚Äî The outlook was uncertain today as ...\` Datelines can take on some unusual forms. When reporters collaborate on a story, two different locations might be listed. The Associated Press omits a dateline \\"when a story has been assembled from sources in widely separate areas\\". In other cases, the exact location may be unknown or intentionally imprecise, such as when covering military operations while on a ship at sea or following an invasion force, or when covering a press conference aboard an airplane. Other media The concept of a dateline has been adapted to television. Reporters on news programs might have their location mentioned in an introduction from the news anchor: :\`\\"Here now from Albuquerque, New Mexico, is reporter Nigel Culpepper\\"\` A field reporter might also end his stories by combining the location from where he filed the report with a \\"lockout\\" (the last thing a reporter says in the report, and includes his name and station ID, in addition to a news branding such as Eyewitness News); especially if the segment is recorded and not live.

It originally served as the township office headquarters for Darlington Township until 1974 when it was annexed by The Town of Newcastle (now Clarington).http://www.villageofhampton.ca/history.php Hampton was founded by Henry Elliot in 1840, who opened the first mill here in the former Darlington Township. At first it was called \\"Elliot's Mill\\" and then by 1848 just \\"Millsville\\". Other former names have included: \\"Hog's Hollow\\" and \\"Shantytown\\". With the opening of the post office the name \\"Hampton\\" was chosen, as it was an abbreviation of Henry Elliot's birthplace, Kirkhampton in Cornwall, England. Hampton has two schools: Hampton Junior Public School which goes from junior kindergarten to grade 3, and M. J. Hobbs Senior Public School which covers grades 4-8. It has two convenience stores, one of which has an LCBO and The Beer Store located inside, two auto garages, one local pizza store, two coffee shops, and Paddy's Market (a new and used appliances store). Hampton is also home to the Darlington sports arena, and local hero, Jay Buckley. Cedar Park Resort Hampton is home to a popular waterpark known as \\"Cedar Park Resort\\". It opened in 1955. It features mini golf, a playground, camping, baseball diamonds, waterslides, a pool with a diving board, a splash pad, aqua playground, tennis court, etc.http://www.cedarparkresort.ca/ Post office history The first post office in Hampton was opened in 1851. At that time, the name of the village was Millsville, but the name was changed with the opening of the post office. Henry Elliott served as its first Postmaster. His son, Henry Jr., took over the position until 1915, when Mr. W. Horn was appointed. During this period, the post office was located on the east side of town at Horn's store (later destroyed by fire in 1983). In 1937, the post office was moved to Barron's store across the street. Finally, in 1971 the post office was moved to the federal building at its present location on Millville Ave, with Pete Barron as Postmaster. Mrs. Nancy Pella became Postmistress in 1982. Mrs. Pella retired in 2011. Mrs. Heather Garvock is the current Postmaster. Today, it services the village with lock boxes and two rural routes. One of these rural routes came into being with the closure of the Enniskillen post office in 1986.

Following the introduction of archaeology into the planning process in most western nations, the importance of gathering as much information as possible on a site without digging it up has grown. Such information can be used to inform the decisions made by planners, developers and archaeologists about the necessity for, and nature of, any archaeological work in advance of new building. A deposit model uses the results of previous excavations and other intrusive archaeological investigations to estimate the nature of the archaeology over a wider area. Productive excavations in one area would suggest that land nearby would also be productive. Since the buried archaeological record is essentially a volume of earth trapped between the two archaeological horizons defined by the underlying natural geology and the horizon of modern intrusions projecting down into the record, the detailed mapping of the underlying geology of an area has become important in deposit modeling and has resulted in a growth of work for geoarchaeologists. The results of surveying can be extrapolated between known geographical points and used to estimate the impact of certain types of development. By taking into account known disturbances to the ground certain areas can be presumed to have limited archaeological potential. A survey of buildings identifying which have basements in them for example may suggest that certain streets have had all their archaeology removed (or truncated) in the past. Where buildings stand on top of probable or known archaeology the effect that their foundations and floors have on ground water levels may also be important in the degree of preservation that can be expected. All this information can be stored on a computer GIS database and analysed and augmented as time goes by and further information is revealed. An early deposit model of the city of York was produced in the early 1990s and has been used to inform archaeological decisions in the city since.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants, Seattle Mariners, Colorado Rockies, San Diego Padres, Texas Rangers, Toronto Blue Jays and Milwaukee Brewers. He bats and throws right-handed. Professional career San Francisco Giants Torrealba signed with the San Francisco Giants as a minor league free agent on September 14, 1994. He made his major league debut with the Giants on September 5, 2001 as a September call up. Torrealba became the Giants back up catcher for the 2002 season after a strong spring training. During Torrealba's early career, his defensive abilities were his key strength, particularly his ability to throw out baserunners. He had 136 at-bats in 2001 and 200 in 2002. During the 2002 postseason, Torrealba would still serve as the backup catcher although he made no appearances as the Giants lost the 2002 World Series to the Anaheim Angels. Yorvit showed some potential, but when Benito Santiago left via free agency in 2003, the Giants opted to trade for A. J. Pierzynski rather than test Torrealba as a full-time player. He continued to serve as the backup catcher when the Giants signed Mike Matheny prior to the 2005 season; in fact, he played less than when Pierzynski was the starter. Torrealba expressed frustration over his lack of playing time to the media more than once, saying he believed he was capable of playing every day. Manager Felipe Alou publicly discussed the possibility of converting Torrealba into a utility player to get him more playing time, but that never came to pass. Seattle Mariners Torrealba was traded, along with pitcher Jesse Foppert, to the Seattle Mariners for outfielder Randy Winn at the trading deadline of the 2005 season. The Mariners were in the midst of a 93-loss season and were rebuilding, and Torrealba competed for the opportunity to be Seattle's starting catcher. Colorado Rockies After the 2005 season, the Seattle Mariners traded Torrealba to the Colorado Rockies for Marcos Carvajal after signing Kenji Johjima to be their starting catcher.https://www.baseball- reference.com/t/torreyo01.html With the Rockies, Torrealba had a chance to be the starting catcher, but lost the job after he was injured prior to the 2006 season, establishing Danny Ardoin as the Rockies starting catcher. Torrealba's injury was a lingering shoulder injury that was caused by overtraining. Colorado Rockies in 2007 During November 2007, rumors that Torrealba would sign with the Mets intensified. Torrealba and the Mets agreed on a deal for $14.4 million over three years. The deal had seemed to be done, but with the failing of Yorvit's physical he was never sent to New York. Torrealba would later file a grievance against the Mets. On November 29, 2007, he re-signed with the Rockies. Torrealba began the 2007 season for the Rockies platooning with rookie catcher Chris Iannetta. When Iannetta struggled, Torrealba won the starting job. On May 29, 2007, against the St. Louis Cardinals, Torrealba hit a grand slam, the 3rd of his career. He finished the season with a .255 average and 47 RBIs in 396 at-bats and he threw out only 17 percent of potential base-stealers, down from his success in previous seasons. Torrealba had some big hits for the Rockies during late 2007, when the Rockies won 12 of their last 13 to force a one-game playoff against the San Diego Padres, which the Rockies won. Torrealba homered off Jake Peavy in that game. Torrealba also hit a 3-run home run off of former teammate Liv√°n Hern√°ndez in Game 3 of the 2007 National League Championship Series. Torrealba led the Rockies to the World Series for the first time ever but lost the series to the Boston Red Sox in a 4-game sweep. Through the 2007 season, Torrealba posted a career .251 batting average with 30 home runs and 173 RBIs in 440 games. As a catcher, he compiled a .997 fielding average with only seventeen errors in 2587 chances; Torrealba's defense has been above average throughout his career. He has thrown out over 32% of all baserunners attempting to steal. His ability to throw out runners was a career low 19.7% in 2007. Due to his impressive postseason play, Torrealba has recently been dubbed \\"Mr. Rocktober.\\" Torrealba has an unusual throwing motion, as he brings his hand to and then snaps his arm in a quick motion, although it seems to work for him, given his success at throwing out baserunners. On November 6, 2009, the Rockies decided to go with youngster Chris Iannetta as their primary catcher and declined their 2010 contract option with Torrealba, making him a free agent. San Diego Padres On February 9, 2010, Torrealba and the San Diego Padres signed a one-year contract with a mutual option for a second year. In 2010, he batted .271, and led the league's catchers in fielding percentage, at .996. Following the season, Torrealba declined the option, but was later offered arbitration by the Padres. Texas Rangers Texas Rangers in 2011 Torrealba agreed to a two-year contract with the Texas Rangers for $6.25 million. Torrealba homered in his second game with his new team. In 2011, he batted .273 with 7 home runs. On defense, he was third in the league in errors by a catcher, totalling 9 errors. Torrealba led the Rangers into the postseason until the team lost the 2011 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. On July 30, 2012, Torrealba was designated for assignment by the Texas Rangers He was released on August 8, 2012. Toronto Blue Jays Torrealba signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays on August 14, 2012 and reported to the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. Torrealba was added to the 40 man roster and called up to the Blue Jays on August 21. On August 22, Torrealba played first base for the first time in his career. Milwaukee Brewers On September 21, 2012, Torrealba was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for cash considerations or a player to be named later. He ended up appearing in six games for the Brewers, going 0-for-5 at the plate with one walk. Second stint with the Colorado Rockies He signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies on January 24, 2013.Rockies Agree To Sign Yorvit Torrealba In 61 games, Torrealba batted .240 and had 8 doubles and 16 RBIs for the Rockies. Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Torrealba signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on January 31, 2014. He got released and became a free agent on March 23. Chicago Cubs Torrealba signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs on June 12, 2014. He was released a month later. Personal life Torrealba's parents gave him his name when they could not decide between Yorman and Victor. They decided to combine the two into \\"Yorvit\\". Torrealba's parents still reside in Venezuela. Torrealba has two sons named Yorvis Eduardo Torrealba (1997) and Julian Xavier Houston- Torrealba (2000). In June 2009, Yorvit Torrealba was unexpectedly placed on the Rockies' restricted list. On June 4, 2009, it was announced that the reason for his absence was that his 11-year-old son and \\"his two uncles\\" had been kidnapped. The abductors set Yorvis and the other family members free without picking up the $50,000 that had been agreed upon. He then moved his son out of Venezuela to Miami. https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=4258424 Yorvis Eduardo tossed the first pitch in the third game of the 2009 National League Division Series against the Phillies , and he was drafted by the Rockies in the 20th round of the 2019 MLB draft. https://www.si.com/mlb/rockies/all-things-rockies/the-story-behind-yorvis- torrealba-son-of-yorvit-rockies-draft-choice Controversy On December 23, 2011, while playing for the Leones del Caracas in the Venezuelan Winter League regular season, Torrealba argued heatedly following a strikeout. He then was ejected by umpire Dario Rivero, Jr. Before leaving, he delivered a shot to Rivero in the head. Torrealba claimed that his attack on the umpire was because of a disputed strike call prior to striking out. As a result, the league suspended Torrealba for 66 games, which did not carry over to Major League Baseball or any other baseball circuit.YouTube.com ‚Äì Yorvit Torrealba agrede al umpire principal en juego Leones-Caribes (Spanish) See also *List of players from Venezuela in Major League Baseball Notes External links * *Venezuelan Professional Baseball League career statistics Category:1978 births Category:Bakersfield Blaze players Category:Bellingham Giants players Category:Bravos de Margarita players Category:Burlington Bees players Category:Colorado Rockies players Category:Colorado Springs Sky Sox players Category:Fresno Grizzlies players Category:Leones del Caracas players Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:Major League Baseball players from Venezuela Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:New Hampshire Fisher Cats players Category:Pastora de los Llanos players Category:Pastora de Occidente players Category:People from Caracas Category:San Diego Padres players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:San Jose Giants players Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:Shreveport Captains players Category:Texas Rangers players Category:Toronto Blue Jays players Category:Venezuelan expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Venezuelan expatriate baseball players in the United States ","title":"Yorvit Torrealba"},{"id":"642669","text":"√Ångel Remigio Hermoso (October 1, 1947 ‚Äì August 21, 2020), commonly known as Remy Hermoso (er-mo'-so), was a Venezuelan Major League Baseball shortstop and right-handed batter who played for the Atlanta Braves (1967), Montreal Expos (1969‚Äì70) and Cleveland Indians (1974).

Known commonly in North America as andromedas or fetterbushes, they are broad-leaved evergreen shrubs growing to tall and wide. The leaves are spirally arranged, often appearing to be in whorls at the end of each shoot with bare stretches of shoot below; they are lanceolate-ovate, long and broad, leathery textured, and with an entire or serrated margin. The young leaves in spring are typically brightly coloured. The flowers are bell-shaped, long, white or pink, and arranged in racemes long. The fruit is a woody capsule which splits into five sections to release the numerous small seeds.

Numerous cultivars have been selected for different spring foliage colour. They grow best in a shady spot, sheltered from drying, winter winds. They prefer acid soil, and should be mulched once per year, using a two-inch covering of either peat or composted pine needles. The flowers give the plant one of its alternative names, 'Lily of the valley shrub' (though Pieris is not closely related to Convallaria).

They are native to North America (mainly in the eastern half of the continent) and Cuba. They grow in acidic soils, with different species in wet acid bog habitats (K. angustifolia, K. polifolia) and dry, sandy soils (K. ericoides, K. latifolia). Kalmia was named by Linnaeus to honour his friend the botanist Pehr Kalm, who collected it in eastern North America during the mid-18th century. Earlier Mark Catesby saw it during his travels in Carolina, and after his return to England in 1726, imported seeds. He described it, a costly rarity, in his Natural History of Carolina, as Chamaedaphne foliis tini, that is to say \\"with leaves like the Laurustinus\\"; the botanist and plant-collector Peter Collinson, who had begged some of the shrub from his correspondent John Custis in Virginia, wrote, when his plants flowered, that \\"I Really Think it exceeds the Laurus Tinus.\\"Alice M.

The fruit is a five- lobed capsule, which splits to release the numerous small seeds. The foliage is toxic if eaten, with sheep being particularly prone to poisoning, hence the name lambkill used for some of the species.

It is native to eastern North America, from southern Pennsylvania south to northwest Florida and west to southern Illinois; it is most common in the lower chain of the Appalachian Mountains. The tree is frequently seen as a component of oak-heath forests. Foliage Growth Sourwood is a small tree or large shrub, growing to tall with a trunk up to diameter. Occasionally on extremely productive sites, this species can reach heights in excess of 30 meters and 60 cm diameter. The leaves are alternately arranged, deciduous, long and broad, with a finely serrated margin; they are dark green in summer, but turn vivid red in fall. The flowers are white, bell-shaped, 6‚Äì9 mm ( 1/4 to 1/3 inch) long, produced on long panicles. The fruit is a small woody capsule. The roots are shallow, and the tree grows best when there is little root competition; it also requires acidic soils for successful growth. The leaves can be chewed (but should not be swallowed) to help alleviate a dry-feeling mouth. Description Raceme of flowers The bark is gray with a reddish tinge, deeply furrowed and scaly. Branchlets at first are light yellow green, but later turn reddish brown. The wood is reddish brown, with paler sapwood; it is heavy, hard, and close-grained, and will take a high polish. Its specific gravity is 0.7458, with a density of 46.48 lb/cu ft. The winter buds are axillary, minute, dark red, and partly immersed in the bark. Inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins. Leaves are alternate, four to seven inches long, 1.5 to 2.5 inches wide, oblong to oblanceolate, wedge-shaped at the base, serrate, and acute or acuminate. Leaf veins are feather-veined, the midrib is conspicuous. They emerge from the bud revolute, bronze green and shining, and smooth; when full grown, they are dark green, shining above, and pale and glaucous below. In autumn, they turn bright scarlet. Petioles are long and slender, with stipules wanting. They are heavily laden with acid. In June and July, cream-white flowers are borne in terminal panicles of secund racemes seven to eight inches long; rachis and short pedicels are downy. The calyx is five-parted and persistent; lobes are valvate in bud. The corolla is ovoid-cylindric, narrowed at the throat, cream-white, and five-toothed. The 10 stamens are inserted on the corolla; filaments are wider than the anthers; anthers are two-celled. The pistil is ovary superior, ovoid, and five-celled; the style is columnar; the stigma is simple; the disk is ten-toothed, and ovules are many. The fruit is a capsule, downy, five-valved, five-angled, and tipped by the persistent style; the pedicels are curving. Cultivation and uses The sourwood is perfectly hardy in the north and a worthy ornamental tree in lawns and parks.

Also known for co-hosting the No Agenda show, in the 2000s, he first became involved in podcasting, and has been called the 'Podfather' because of his efforts. Early broadcast career Adam Curry in 1984. Curry was born in Arlington, Virginia, but lived in Amstelveen, Netherlands, from 1972 to 1987. After a time working in Dutch pirate radio at Radio Picasso in Amstelveen and in Amsterdam in the early eighties under the pseudonym \\"John Holden\\", he got a break in broadcasting as the host of the Dutch weekly pop-music television program Countdown, and the English version of the same show, which was broadcast on pan-European music channel Music Box. He also hosted several other radio and television programs for the Dutch broadcast station Veronica. Aside Countdown, in the Netherlands Adam Curry is mostly known for his part in the Curry and Van Inkel radioshow (together with Dutch DJ Jeroen van Inkel), broadcast on Radio 3 for Veronica between 19:00 and 22:00 on Friday. In 1987, Curry became a VJ for MTV. Besides making spot appearances between music videos, he was also host of the programs Headbangers Ball and MTV Top 20 Video Countdown in which he interviewed stars like Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney. While working for MTV, he also did radio work, including drive-time host for the New York City radio station WHTZ, and host of the national program HitLine USA. Curry hosted the radio countdown show \\"Adam Curry's Top 30 Hitlist\\" for Entertainment Radio Networks from November 1991 to June 1994. Web and MTV.com Curry registered the then-unclaimed domain name \\"mtv.com\\" in 1993 with the idea of being MTV's unofficial new voice on the Internet. Although this move was sanctioned by his superiors at MTV Networks at the time, when Curry left to start his own web-portal design and hosting company, OnRamp Inc, MTV subsequently sued him for the domain name. OnRamp eventually grew to 4,000 employees and was sold to Think New Ideas Inc., another company that he co-founded, becoming Chief Technology Officer of Think. In 1996, as the Internet was undergoing its \\"bubble\\", the company made an initial public offering on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol THNK. It subsequently grew to employ over 7400 people and with offices in seven countries, and was absorbed into Answerthink Inc., in a later merger. In 2005, Curry founded a video sharing site called PodShow, which later changed its name to Mevio, with Ron Bloom. In May 2008, Mevio claimed to have reached 9 million unique visitors. It offers advertisers \\"brand safe\\" content on a large scale. It raised a US$15 million third round in July 2008, bringing the total amount it has raised since its launch to over US$38 million. Mevio later rebranded as Bitesize Entertainment and ultimately BiteSizeTV, located in Los Angeles, CA. Enterprises in the U.S. and Europe After selling his business in the U.S., Curry and his family moved to the Netherlands in 1999, where Curry hosted a morning talk/music show for Radio Veronica. He also landed various television assignments and his family briefly starred in the reality show Adam's Family. Curry and two business partners founded the multimedia company United Resources of Jamby in 1999. It was to act as an incubator and cultivator for new Internet-related businesses. The business was ultimately unsuccessful. Curry's participation in Kennisnet, another venture to introduce the Internet to Dutch schools, ended in a bitter argument and lawsuits. Sportus.nl, an online webshop in collaboration with Dutch athletes like Marcel Wouda, Jacco Eltingh, Ron Zwerver and Dani√´lle Overgaag, started in 1999, went bankrupt in 2001. Another content exchange project, Freedom Controller, was cancelled in 2002. In 2000 he and business partner Simon Cavendish, a participant in his earlier ventures, founded the RotorJet company to offer helicopter services. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2005. In the subsequent dispute, Cavendish seized the assets of the company, and in April 2005, Curry was ordered by a Dutch court to repay approximately US$3 million that he had withdrawn from RotorJet. In 2002 he produced and starred in the reality soap Adam's Family: een kijkje in het leven van de familie Curry which was aired by the Dutch SBS6 network. Podcasting Curry founded PodShow, now Mevio, with his business partner Ron Bloom, in January 2005. PodShow is a podcast promotions and advertising company that encompasses the Podshow Podcast Network, the Podcast Delivery Network, and the Podsafe Music Network. Some of Podshow's top podcasts are Curry's own Daily Source Code, The Dawn and Drew Show, and GeekBrief.TV. From June 2005 to May 2007, Curry hosted a weekday evening show on Sirius Satellite Radio called 'Adam Curry's PodShow'. In late 2005 Curry was caught making anonymous edits to the Podcast Wikipedia page, deleting several sections concerning contributions made by fellow podcasting pioneers, Kevin Marks and Stephen Downes, while adding material that emphasized his own involvement with the development of the medium. Curry went on to evoke ignorance as his primary defense stating, \\"I edited out the Marks part previously because I never saw a full front-to-back solution that he was credited for...Once I saw the video of the session where he does demo it, after saying he had spoken to me and I had 'challenged' him to create it, I realized I was in error.\\" He also claimed to have difficulty with the Wikipedia interface, claiming he had originally planned to revise the paragraphs to include his recollections of events but instead became \\"exasperated\\" with the process and decided to give up. Since October 2007, he has hosted the twice-weekly podcast the No Agenda Show with John C. Dvorak, discussing recent news whilst deconstructing mainstream news media. The podcast does not accept any advertising and is solely supported by the listeners. Curry has heavily promoted his podcasting endeavors. He promoted his podcast Daily Source Code in Second Life under the name 'Adam Neumann', along with a Second Life island called Podshow Island. Curry used podcasting to endorse 2008 Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul. He also uses his show to discuss alternative takes on topics in the daily news, as well as offering up topics of discussion that are \\"off the beaten path\\", such as Free energy suppressionDaily Source Code Episode 781, \\"Confessions of a multimedia hitman\\" and the 9/11 Truth Movement. Curry is widely credited for popularizing the podcast medium. As Annalee Newitz noted in Wired, \\"Every new medium needs a celebrity, and Curry is happy to fill that role.\\" On March 4, 2020 Curry appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast The Joe Rogan Experience and later re-appeared on September 8, 2020. During the September show, he discussed having Tourette syndrome. Creative Commons licensing In February 2006, Curry sued the Dutch tabloid Weekend for reprinting photos from his Flickr page and publishing details about his daughter. The photos were released under a version of the Creative Commons license that forbids commercial use and requires acknowledgement, but the tabloid printed a few of them without contacting Curry. The verdict did not award Curry any damages, but forbade the tabloid from reprinting the photos in the future, setting a fine of ‚Ç¨1,000 for each subsequent violation. It was one of the first times the license was tested in court. In May 2009, Curry posted on his blog that another Dutch tabloid had published another Creative Commons-licensed photo from Curry's Flickr account. After Curry asserted Creative Commons license requirements, the publisher settled on Curry's terms. Personal life Since 1999, Curry has, at one time or another, lived in Belgium, Guildford, London, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin. Curry was married to Dutch television/radio personality Patricia Paay from 1989 to 2009. They have a daughter, Christina. In July 2012, Curry married Micky Hoogendijk. On January 29, 2015, Curry announced on the No Agenda show that he and Hoogendijk had separated. Hoogendijk and Curry divorced in 2015. Curry married his girlfriend of four years, Tina Snider (dubbed \\"The Keeper\\" by John C. Dvorak on the No Agenda Show), on May 19, 2019 in Austin, Texas. Curry is the nephew of former CIA official and United States Ambassador to Korea, Donald Gregg, whom he calls \\"Uncle Don\\" in his podcast.

Initially, no sequel was planned, but it was produced after the unexpected financial success of the first film. It is the last entry in the franchise to be released theatrically, as well as the last to feature the original cast. Plot In the Newton family home, George, Alice, Ryce, Ted, Emily, and Beethoven are all well adjusted to living together. Beethoven sneaks out and meets Missy, a female St. Bernard, and her owner Brillo. Regina, Brillo's future ex-wife, arrives with her boyfriend Floyd, takes Missy, and is seeking $50,000 in the settlement as alimony. She has retained full custody of Missy and only plans to transfer her to Brillo once the divorce is finalized. With Beethoven's help, Missy escapes from Regina's condominium, and they fall in love. Meanwhile, Ryce develops strong feelings for her classmate, Taylor Devereaux, after he kisses her. Ted and Emily become aware of Beethoven constantly sneaking out of the house and follow him, where they discover he and Missy had four puppies in the basement of the building. The janitor also finds them and informs Regina. She reclaims Missy and plans to get rid of the puppies, even if it means killing them, but the janitor talks her out of it by pointing out that purebred puppies are worth a lot of money and suggests that she could sell them at a pet store and make a fortune. Thinking Regina plans to drown the puppies, Ted and Emily sneak out of the building with the puppies and take them home. They keep them in the basement so their father will not see them. Realizing they took them, Regina plans revenge. Ryce, Ted, and Emily take it upon themselves to feed and care for them. Eventually, George discovers the puppies and reluctantly agrees to keep them until they are mature. The Newtons are offered a free stay in a lakefront house at the mountains owned by one of George's business associates. There, Taylor invites Ryce to a party with friends where she is exposed to teenage drinking. Beethoven destroys the house's patio deck, removing her from potential danger. Regina and Floyd, are staying in a location unknown to Brillo, coincidentally near the Newtons' vacation house. They go to a county fair with the dogs, and the children persuade George to enter a burger eating contest with Beethoven, which they win. Regina and Floyd were also at the fair but left Missy in their car. Missy escapes from the car with Beethoven's help while Regina snatches the puppies' leashes from Ted and Emily. Beethoven and Missy run into the mountains, followed by Regina and Floyd. The Newtons follow and catch up. After a confrontation between George and Floyd, Floyd threatens to drop the puppies in the river below and pokes George in the stomach with a large stick. Beethoven charges into the stick and rams it into Floyd's groin, causing him to lose his balance and fall over the cliff, pulling Regina down with him. They fall into a pool of mud and are swept away by the river. Five months later, Brillo visits the Newtons with Missy, revealing that the judge in the divorce had granted him full custody of her and denied Regina's claim. The puppies, much older, run downstairs to see Missy.

Production The film is set in California, but the park scenes were filmed in Montana at Glacier National Park. The house used as the Newton family home is located on Milan Avenue in South Pasadena. Production required more than a hundred smooth- and rough-coated St. Bernard puppies of various ages starting at seven weeks, who were then returned to the breeders. Missy was played by three adult short-haired dogs, and Beethoven was played by two long-haired ones, although only the dog who created the role in the first film is credited; a mechanical dog, a dog's head for specific facial expressions, and a man in a dog suit were also used. Song The theme song, \\"The Day I Fall in Love\\", performed by James Ingram and Dolly Parton, was nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy Award. Reception The film grossed more than $118 million at the box office worldwide. Critical response Brian Lowry of Variety wrote that the film \\"[amounted] to a live- action cartoon\\" and was \\"certainly a more pleasing tale\\" than the first. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it two stars, calling it \\"no masterpiece\\" but praising Grodin's work and noting that the dogs carried the film. Kevin Thomas in the Los Angeles Times rated it \\"just as funny and appealing as 'Beethoven' the first\\" and also praised Mazar as Regina. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 23%, based on reviews from 13 critics, with an average rating of 4.55/10. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave it a grade A.

It is the third sequel to the 1992 film, Beethoven and is the fourth installment in the Beethoven film series. It was released on December 4, 2001. It is the last film to feature Judge Reinhold as Richard Newton, Julia Sweeney as Beth Newton, Joe Pichler as Brennan Newton, and Michaela Gallo as Sara Newton.  Plot  Richard Newton checks in with his two children, Sara and Brennan, before school. The children love their St. Bernard dog, Beethoven, who they are keeping for a relative family, but their parents do not, and want to get rid of him. So the children begin taking the dog to Obedience Training led by a former army sergeant. Brennan falls in love with a girl named Hayley, while Beethoven literally destroys the obstacle course in one day. To top it all off, Beethoven hits the army sergeant in the groin with a leash causing him to kneel over in pain. Meanwhile, the rich Sedgewick family owns a pampered and well-behaved St. Bernard that looks exactly like Beethoven, named Michelangelo. Michelangelo and young Madison Sedgewick are friends, but her busy parents, Reginald and Martha, are always neglecting her. In fact, Reginald is the only one who seems to try to play with her. Beethoven, meanwhile, runs after a loose hot dog cart, and ends up on a merry-go-round. Michelangelo has gotten loose, as weel, and is now on the same merry-go-round. Brennan and Sara mistake him for Beethoven and take him home. The real Beethoven is mistaken for Michelangelo, and grabbed by Jonathan Simmons, the Sedgewick family's butler and taken to their mansion. Sara is surprised when Michelangelo wipes his feet on the welcome mat and folds the napkins with his teeth at dinner. The Sedgewicks notice the change in \\"their dog\\" too, when he bolts Simmons to the ground to get a piece of turkey. That night, Beethoven hears Madison whimpering because of a bad dream, and comforts her. At the next obedience class, Michelangelo leaves everyone in astonishment, by finishing the entire new obstacle course, while the sergeant is announcing about the course. Meanwhile, Beethoven ruins a dinner party, when a man named Nigel tries to kidnap him. A therapist points out to Martha that the reason \\"Michelangelo\\" is acting this way is because he is the first one exhibiting \\"symptoms\\". The therapist suggests that it may be because Martha does not care about anyone but herself. Richard is concerned about \\"Beethoven\\", and starts acting out to get \\"Beethoven\\" to misbehave again too. Richard drinks toilet water, chases the mailman, etc. Michelangelo ends up catching on, and starts behaving like Beethoven. The Sedgewick family start playing fetch and swimming with Beethoven. But as the Sedgewicks and Beethoven are hiking, Nigel (who turns out to be Simmons' sidekick) kidnaps Beethoven and locks him in a warehouse, for a ransom of $250,000. But Beethoven breaks out and secretly switches places with Michelangelo at the obedience graduation. The real Michelangelo is found by the Sedgewicks, and Simmons and Nigel are arrested by two FBI agents. The real Beethoven is found by the Newtons, and he graduates. The Sedgewicks and Newtons then meet up at a fork on the road, though, they never find out about the switching of Beethoven and Michelangelo.

It was created in 1824 by a dam built during the construction of what is now the A56 road, when local inhabitants objected to initial plans for a route through the village centre. It may have been used to supply power to local industry, and the surrounding area. Warrington Borough Council began managing the Lymm Dam and its park in the early 1980s. At that time there were considerable erosion problems and the Ranger Service began to upgrade the existing path network and take over the park maintenance. It is now a popular visitor attraction, which has won several Green Flag Awards for its improvements to the infrastructure and ecology of the dam.

Vaf√ær√∫√∞nism√°l (Old Norse: \\"The Lay of Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir\\") is the third poem in the Poetic Edda. It is a conversation in verse form conducted initially between the √Üsir Odin and Frigg, and subsequently between Odin and the giant Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir. The poem goes into detail about the Norse cosmogony and was evidently used extensively as a source document by Snorri Sturluson in the construction of the Prose Edda who quotes it. The poem is preserved in Codex Regius and partially in AM 748 I 4to. There are preservation problems relating to stanzas 40-41. Synopsis A depiction of Frigg asking Odin not to go to Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir (1895) by Lorenz Fr√∏lich. The lay commences with Odin asking advice and directions of Frigg as to whether it would be wise to seek out the hall of Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir. Frigg counsels against this course of action, saying that Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir is an extremely powerful giant, the most powerful one she knows. Nevertheless Odin continues with his quest. On arriving at Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir's hall, Odin seeks to obtain Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir's wisdom through the classic mechanism of a wisdom contest. Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir's response is to accept the wanderer in his hall and only allow him to leave alive if Odin proves to be wiser. Odin, a master of dissimulation, attempts to pass himself off as Gagnr√°√∞r (trans. \\"victory\\"), and beseeches the traditional hospitality which should be afforded to wayfarers. Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir, wrong-footed, invites him in and to seat himself. A game of riddling then ensues between the pair. During the course of stanza 19, Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir was unwise enough to wager his head in the case of defeat: victory for Odin will result in his death. In stanza 55, at the conclusion of the contest, Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir is obliged to capitulate to Odin's cunning when Odin asks him what Odin whispered in Baldr's ear prior to Baldr's body being placed on the funerary ship, a question to which only Odin knows the answer; it is a rule of the wisdom contest that questions could only be asked to which the questioner knew the answer and so it is at this point that Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir recognizes his guest for who he is: :You alone know that, what long ago :You said in the ears of your son. :I doomed myself when I dared to tell :What fate will befall the gods, :And staked my wit against the wit of Odin, :Ever the wisest of all. ::Vaf√ær√∫√∞nism√°l 55, translated by Auden and Taylor  References   Bibliography  * Further reading * *Vaf√ær√∫√∞nism√°l, T.

The pastry is usually shortcrust pastry; the filling may be sweet or savoury, though modern tarts are usually fruit-based, sometimes with custard. Tartlet refers to a miniature tart; an example would be egg tarts. The categories of \\"tart\\", \\"flan\\", \\"quiche\\", and \\"pie\\" overlap, with no sharp distinctions.  History  alt= The French word tarte can be translated to mean either pie or tart, as both are mainly the same with the exception of a pie usually covering the filling in pastry, while flans and tarts leave it open.Davidson: s.v. 'tart' Tarts are thought to have either come from a tradition of layering food, or to be a product of Medieval pie making. Enriched dough (i.e. short crust) is thought to have been first commonly used in 1550, approximately 200 years after pies. In this period, they were viewed as high-cuisine, popular with nobility, in contrast to the view of a commoners pie. While originally savoury, with meat fillings, culinary tastes led to sweet tarts to prevail, filling tarts instead with fruit and custard. Early medieval tarts generally had meat fillings, but later ones were often based on fruit and custard.Davidson: s.v. 'tart' An early tart was the Italian crostata, dating to at least the mid-15th century. It has been described as a \\"rustic free-form version of an open fruit tart\\".Corley: 2011. Page 129.  Description  Lemon Meringue Tartsalt= Tarts are typically free-standing with firm pastry base consisting of dough, itself made of flour, thick filling, and perpendicular sides while pies may have softer pastry, looser filling, and sloped sides, necessitating service from the pie plate.  Varieties  There are many types of tarts, with popular varieties including Treacle tart, meringue tart, tarte tatin and Bakewell tart. A jam tart uses jam in place of fresh fruit. Tarte Tatin is an upside-down tart, of apples, other fruit, or onions. Savoury tarts include quiche, a family of savoury tarts with a mostly custard filling; German Zwiebelkuchen 'onion tart', and Swiss cheese tart made from Gruyere.

Candler founded The Coca- Cola Company in 1892 and developed it as a major company. Prominent among civic leaders of Atlanta, Candler was elected and served as the 41st Mayor of the city, from 1916 to 1919. Candler Field, the site of the present-day Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, was named after him, as is Candler Park in Atlanta. As head of Coca-Cola, he built the Candler Building in Atlanta, as well as one in Kansas City (which became known as the Western Auto Building), a Candler Building (New York City), and one at what is now known as the Inner Harbor area of Baltimore, Maryland.  Family  Asa Griggs Candler was born on December 30, 1851 in Villa Rica, Georgia. His parents were Martha and Samuel Charles Candler, a merchant and property owner. His parents raised eleven children, including Asa and his brother Warren Akin Candler. Samuel Charles Candler was a member of the legislature of South Carolina, and fought in the Creek War of 1836. ;Children of Asa Griggs Candler: * Asa's eldest son, Charles Howard Candler (1878‚Äì1957), was chairman of the board of trustees of Emory University. His family estate was Callanwolde on Briarcliff Road in Druid Hills; it has been adapted for use as a fine arts center. * The second son, Asa G. Candler, Jr. (1880‚Äì1953), eccentric, alcoholic, and depressed, became a real-estate developer, opening the Briarcliff Hotel. His Briarcliff mansion and estate‚Äîalso on Briarcliff Road in Druid Hills‚Äîwas adapted for use as an alcoholism rehab center, then a psychiatric hospital. It is now owned by Emory University and used as its Briarcliff campus. Asa Jr.'s menagerie of animals enabled a major expansion of Zoo Atlanta in the 1930s. * Only daughter Lucy (1882‚Äì1962) married Henry Heinz, a banker and Kiwanis president. He was shot by a burglar in their mansion, Rainbow Terrace, in 1943.\\"Husband of Coca Cola Heiress is Slain by Burglar\\", Paineseville Telegraph, September 29, 1943 Rumours persisted that a relative murdered him.Mark Pendergrast, For God, Country and Coca-Cola, p.133 The widowed Lucy Candler Heinz later married cellist and conductor Enrico Leide. He founded a forerunner of the present Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. * Third son Walter T. Candler (1885‚Äì1967) was a businessman, philanthropist, and horse sportsman. His Lullwater House and estate has been adapted for use as the residence of the Emory University President. Another portion is a park, and other land is the site of a Veterans Administration complex in Druid Hills. Walter T. Candler had one daughter. * Youngest son William Candler (1890‚Äì1936), was the local financier of the Atlanta Biltmore Hotel and Biltmore Apartments. He was elected president of the Biltmore Corporation in February 1930, and was manager of the Biltmore Hotel. His mansion, named Rest Haven, is located on Springdale Road in Druid Hills.  Biography   Founder of Coca-Cola  A druggist in 1888, Asa Griggs Candler met John Stith Pemberton and was intrigued by a sweet, carbonated drink he had developed. Candler bought the Coca-Cola recipe from Pemberton, for an amount rumored to be $2,300. The drink was derived from brewed coca leaves, as well as caffeine, carbonated water, and sugar. In 1892, he founded the Coca-Cola Company. The following year, he trademarked the brand and distributed the first dividends to the company's shareholders. By 1895, the company was distributing Coca-Cola nationwide in the United States. It first started exporting in 1899, to Cuba. Exports to Europe started two years later. He also developed the famous \\"$1 contract\\" where he sold the rights to bottle Coca-Cola in the US for only one dollar. At first, the company advertised Coca-Cola as a drink that relieved mental and physical fatigue, and cured headaches. In 1903, Candler decided to remove the cocaine component from the coca leaves before mixing them with the drink, and to sell the extracted cocaine to pharmaceutical companies. In 1911, the company reached an annual advertising budget of $1 million. In 1915, the bottling company Root Glass Co. created the iconic Coca-Cola bottle. In 1916, after Candler was elected mayor of Atlanta, he ended his day-to-day management of the Coca-Cola Company. In 1917, the Coca-Cola company agreed to reduce by 50% the amount of caffeine in the drink. In 1919 Candler gave most of the stock in The Coca-Cola Company to his children. They sold their shares to a consortium of investors led by Ernest Woodruff.  Atlanta builder and mayor  In 1906 Candler completed what was then Atlanta's tallest building, the Candler Building. It had intricately carved decorations and was 17 stories tall. It still stands at Peachtree and Auburn streets and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, significant for its architectural detail and role as a company symbol.Candler Building--Atlanta: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary In 1912 the Candler Building in New York opened. In 1916, Candler was elected mayor of Atlanta (taking office in 1917). As mayor he balanced the city budget and coordinated rebuilding efforts after the Great Atlanta fire of 1917 destroyed 1,500 homes. He also made large personal loans in order to develop the water and sewage facilities of the city of Atlanta, in order to provide the infrastructure necessary to a modern city. Candler was also a philanthropist, endowing numerous schools and universities (he gave a total of $7 million to Emory University,) and the Candler Hospital in Savannah, Georgia. Candler had paid to relocate Emory University from Oxford, Georgia to Atlanta. Asa Candler suffered a stroke in 1926 and never recovered. He died on March 12, 1929 at Wesley Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. He is buried at Westview Cemetery on the west side of Atlanta.  Legacy   Atlanta  The Candler Field Museum in Williamson, Georgia, has been established to commemorate the original Candler Field, the first Atlanta airport. Callan Castle, the Candler home in Inman Park, built from 1902 to 1904, still stands as a private home. Candler's later mansion, built in 1916 at 1500 Ponce de Leon Avenue, Druid Hills, was later adapted for use as the John Chrysostom Melkite Greek Catholic Church. In 1922, he donated over of his Druid Hills holdings to the City of Atlanta for what became Candler Park. That year he also sold the Central Bank and Trust.

Several Candler buildings were constructed as the Coca-Cola Company expanded in the early 20th century: *Baltimore, Maryland - The Candler Building, located on the northeast corner of East Pratt Street and Market Place in eastern downtown, at the Inner Harbor, still bears his name. The brick industrial style building faces the waterfront of the basin of Baltimore Harbor, on the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River. Used as a regional headquarters for the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, the structure was known for having brass door knobs engraved with \\"CC\\" for the company. Between the late 1930s and 1960, the building served as the national headquarters of the new Social Security Administration. This agency was authorized under the Social Security Act of 1935, one of the New Deal programs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. By the 2000s, as the old waterfront area and municipal piers area were being redeveloped from commercial and industrial uses, the Candler Building was renovated for offices and some apartments/condos. *In Kansas City, the Western Auto Building was known as the Coca-Cola Building or Candler Building when constructed for the Coca-Cola Company in 1914, and during its occupancy. It has been converted to loft condominiums. *In New York City, the Candler Building is still in use.

Description Generally, a gumball machine consists of a clear sphere (originally glass, now most often plastic) which is filled with gumballs, sitting on top of a metal base. It has a metal top on top of it with a keyhole in top of it so that the top can be removed and gumballs can be put in. The coin is inserted into the base and a handle is turned around clockwise 360 degrees, depositing the coin in the base of the machine and allowing a gumball or trinket to be dispensed into a chute at the bottom of the machine that is closed off by a little metal hanging flap. Most gumball machines have a simple mechanism for dispensing the gumball, to the point of the actual dispensation being largely invisible (after turning the handle the gumball is deposited behind the door). However, some gumball machines have more elaborate methods. Most of them utilize the potential energy of the gumball's location above the base, by, for instance, causing it to roll down a spiral ramp, or a set of diagonal disks (each one is tilted in the opposite direction than the preceding one) with holes in lowest point. The most elaborate mechanisms also use electricity to power various forms of transit (e.g. lifts and pulleys) as well as ramps and drops for the gumball upon its way to dispensation.

Hydrogenolysis Of Oxygenated Organic Compounds. J. Am. Chem. Soc.; 1932; 54(12); 4678‚Äì4690. The heteroatom may vary, but it usually is oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. A related reaction is hydrogenation, where hydrogen is added to the molecule, without cleaving bonds. Usually hydrogenolysis is conducted catalytically using hydrogen gas. History The term \\"hydrogenolysis\\" was coined by Carleton Ellis in reference to hydrogenolysis of carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds.Carleton Ellis. Hydrogenation of Organic Substances, 3rd ed., Van Nostrand Company, New York, 1930, p. 564 (as referred by Connor and Adkins). Earlier, Sabatier had already observed the hydrogenolysis of benzyl alcohol to toluene,Sabatier and Murat. Ann. Chim. [9] 4, 258, (1915), according to Connor and Adkins. and as early as 1906, Padoa and Ponti had observed the hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol.Furfuryl alcohol hydrogenation is accompanied by hydrogenolysis into 2-methylfuran, which gives 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and further hydrogenolysis opens the ring to give 2-pentanol. Original: Padoa and Ponti. Atti. R. accad. Lincei, 15, [5] 610 (1906); Gazz. chim. ital. 37, [2] 105 (1907), according to Kaufmann: W. E. Kaufmann, Roger Adams.

Homer Burton Adkins and Ralph Connor were the first to call the carbon‚Äìoxygen bond cleavage \\"hydrogenolysis\\". In the petrochemical industry In petroleum refineries, catalytic hydrogenolysis of feedstocks is conducted on a large scale to remove sulfur from feedstocks, releasing gaseous hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The hydrogen sulfide is subsequently recovered in an amine treater and finally converted to elemental sulfur in a Claus process unit. In those industries, desulfurization process units are often referred to as hydrodesulfurizers (HDS) or hydrotreaters (HDT). Catalysts are based on molybdenum sulfide containing smaller amounts of cobalt or nickel. Hydrogenolysis is accompanied by hydrogenation.Tops√∏e, H.; Clausen, B. S.; Massoth, F. E., Hydrotreating Catalysis, Science and Technology, Springer-Verlag: Berlin, 1996. Another hydrogenolysis reaction of commercial importance is the hydrogenolysis of esters into alcohols by catalysts such as copper chromite. The hydrodeoxygenation reaction used in the Neste Renewable Diesel process, the vegetable oil refining process of largest production capacity, is a hydrogenolysis of triglycerides into alkanes. In the laboratory In the laboratory, hydrogenolysis is used in organic synthesis. Debenzylation is most common and involves the cleavage of benzyl ethers:For example, Organic Syntheses, Coll.

Laboratory hydrogenolysis is operationally similar to hydrogenation, and may be accomplished at atmospheric pressure by stirring the reaction mixture under a slight positive pressure of hydrogen gas, having flushed the apparatus with more of this gas. The hydrogen may be provided by attaching a balloon to a needle, filling it from a bottle, and inserting the needle into the reaction flask via a rubber septum. At high pressure, a hydrogenation autoclave (i.e., a Buchi or Parr hydrogenator) or similar piece of equipment is required.

Effects This law put fugitive slaves at risk for recapture the rest of their lives, but some slave-owners did not think that it was strong enough. It also classified children born to fugitive slave mothers as slaves and the property of their mother's master for the rest of their lives. Oney Judge, sometimes spelled Ona, was one of Martha Washington's slaves and chambermaids. She served the Washingtons in Virginia and at the President's House in Philadelphia when Washington was President (the city was the temporary capital from 1790 to 1800). She escaped on May 21, 1796.Stephan Salisbury, \\"A slave's defiance\\" , Philadelphia Inquirer, July 2008, at Philly Archeology Forum, accessed 18 February 2012 Washington made two attempts to seize her shortly afterwards, even enlisting the help of the Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott Jr. in a letter written on September 1, 1796.Letter to Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott, Jr, September 1, 1796 , Writings of Washington, Vol. 35 Later, his nephew visited her and asked for her to return. Neither attempt was successful. Washington acted discreetly to avoid controversy in Philadelphia, which had a strong Quaker abolitionist community. Having settled in New Hampshire, married and had a child, Oney Judge was interviewed by Rev. Benjamin Chase in the 1840s. He published the account in a \\"letter to the editor\\" in the abolitionist newspaper The Liberator on January 1, 1847. He described how under the law, she and her child were still at risk for being seized as a fugitive slave at any time, even 50 years after her escape, if Martha Washington's descendants decided to make a legal claim. Legally, they had inherited the pair as part of their mother's estate: > \\"This woman is yet a slave. If Washington could have got her and her child, > they were constitutionally his; and if Mrs. Washington's heirs were now to > claim her, and take her before Judge Woodbury, and prove their title, he > would be bound, upon his oath, to deliver her up to them.\\"\\"Oney Judge > Interview\\", President's House in Philadelphia, US History.org Many northern states enacted legislation to protect free black Americans (who could otherwise be abducted, brought before court without the ability to produce a defense, and then lawfully enslaved) as well as runaway slaves. Those laws came to be known as personal liberty laws and required slave owners and fugitive hunters to produce evidence that their captures were truly fugitive slaves, \\"just as southern states demanded the right to retrieve runaway slaves, northern states demanded the right to protect their free black residents from being kidnapped and sold into servitude in the south\\" (Finkelman 399). One controversy was the case of Prigg v. Pennsylvania. Edward Prigg, a citizen of Maryland, was indicted by a Pennsylvania court for attempting to kidnap a black woman in York County to return her to Maryland as a fugitive slave. He was tried and convicted by a local court in Pennsylvania, but the case was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Prigg had originally shown his legal warrant to the Pennsylvania court, but it had been unlawfully ignored, which demonstrated that the Fugitive Slave Act really depended on state judges, not federal law. The slave-catching industry expanded as a result of the law with men who were effectively bounty hunters, capturing and returning many slaves to their \\"owners\\". In addition, the high demand for slaves in the Deep South and hunt for fugitives caused free blacks to be at risk of being kidnapped and sold into slavery, even if they had their \\"free\\" papers. There were numerous instances of people who were legally free and had never been slaves being captured and brought south to be sold into slavery. The historian Carol Wilson documented 300 such cases in Freedom at Risk (1994) and estimated there were likely thousands of others.Carol Wilson, Freedom at Risk: The Kidnapping of Free Blacks in America, 1780‚Äì1865, University Press of Kentucky, 1994 A prominent example was Solomon Northup, born free around 1808 to Mintus Northup and his wife in Essex County, New York state. (In his memoir, Solomon did not name his mother but described her as of mixed race and a quadroon.)Solomon Northrup, David Wilson, Twelve Years a Slave, Auburn, NY: Orton & Mulligan, 1853, Documenting the American South, University of North Carolina In 1841, Northup was tricked into going to Washington, DC, where slavery was legal. He was drugged, kidnapped, and sold into slavery, and he was held as a slave in Louisiana for 12 years. One of the very few to regain freedom under such circumstances, he later sued the slave traders involved in Washington, DC. Its law prohibited Northrup from testifying against the white men because he was black and so he lost the case. The New York Times published an article on the trial on January 20, 1853.\\"THE KIDNAPPING CASE. Narrative of the Seizure and Recovery of Solomon Northrup. INTERESTING DISCLOSURES\\", New York Times, 20 January 1853, carried at Documents of the American South, University of North Carolina Northup published his memoir, Twelve Years a Slave (1853), a slave narrative of plantation life on the Red River in Louisiana, and a description of Washington, D.C.'s slave trade.Solomon Northrup, Twelve Years a Slave, ed. David Wilson, Buffalo, NY: Miller, Orton & Mulligan, 1853 The memoir was adapted as a feature film by Steve McQueen in 2013, winning three Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

According to the church website and other sources it is \\"the oldest church in the City of London\\" and was founded in or before AD 675. These claims are not supported by recent research. The church survived the Great Fire of London in 1666, but was badly damaged during the Blitz in World War II. Following extensive reconstruction, it was rededicated in 1957. From 1922 until 1962 the vicar was the Reverend Philip T. B. \\"Tubby\\" Clayton, and the church is still the guild church of Toc H, the international Christian organisation that he founded.  History  Reconstruction during 1955, after extensive damage in the Blitz. The origin and early history of All Hallows-by- the-Tower church are obscure. At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 the church belonged to Barking Abbey, a wealthy Benedictine nunnery in Barking, Essex, originally established in the 7th century. The association with Barking was a long one, and All Hallows church was already known as \\"Berkyncherche\\" in the 12th century. According to Domesday Book in 1086, Barking Abbey possessed \\"28 houses and half a church\\" in London: although the church is not named, it is usually identified with All Hallows. The original Anglo-Saxon abbey of Barking was founded by Earconwald or Erkenwald before he became Bishop of London in about 675, and it has been claimed that the land on which All Hallows stands was granted to the abbey, and the first church established, at that time. Although this is a tempting assumption, it is doubtful. A charter dated to 687, listing properties belonging to Barking Abbey at that time, includes two pieces of land in or near London. One of these was simply described as \\"iuxta Lundoniam\\", near/next to London, the other as \\"supra vicum Lundoniae\\", that is, in \\"Lunden-wic\\", the Anglo-Saxon town that had grown up in the area of the Strand, a mile to the west of the old Roman city of Londinium; neither description matches the location of All Hallows church, inside the wall of the Roman city on the eastern side. In 1940, during World War II, the clearance after destruction caused by bombing revealed an archway built of reused Roman tiles and stonework, set in a surviving wall of the medieval church. The reuse of Roman building materials, and comparison with arches in the early Anglo-Saxon church at Brixworth, Northamptonshire, suggested that the All Hallows arch was very early in date, and that the original church could have been built in the 7th century. This seemed to confirm the belief that the church had been founded as a daughter church of Barking Abbey at about the same time as the abbey itself was established. However, more recent research, and archaeological evidence that Roman tiles and stone were being used in the construction of other London churches as late as the 11th century, suggest that the arch belongs to this later period. Fragments of three 11th-century stone crosses also found during clearance works after the bombing, now displayed in the crypt, are consistent with an 11th-century date for the first church. The church was expanded and rebuilt several times between the 11th and 15th centuries. Its proximity to the Tower of London meant that it acquired royal connections, with Edward IV making one of its chapels a royal chantry and the beheaded victims of Tower executions being sent for temporary burial at All Hallows. The interior The church was badly damaged by an explosion in 1650\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert,C;Weinreb,D;Keay,J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008) caused when some barrels of gunpowder being stored in the churchyard exploded; its west tower and some 50 nearby houses were destroyed, and there were many fatalities.\\"The City Churches\\" Tabor, M. p23:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 The tower was rebuilt in 1658, the only example of work carried out on a church during the Commonwealth era of 1649‚Äì1660. It only narrowly survived the Great Fire of London in 1666 and owes its survival to Admiral William Penn, father of William Penn of Pennsylvania fame, who had his men from a nearby naval yard demolish the surrounding buildings to create firebreaks. During the Great Fire, Samuel Pepys climbed the church's spire to watch the progress of the blaze and what he described as \\"the saddest sight of desolation\\". Restored in the late 19th century, All Hallows was gutted by German bombers during the Blitz in World War II and required extensive reconstruction, only being rededicated in 1957. The main-altar mural, a post-war work by Brian Thomas Many portions of the old church survived the War and have been sympathetically restored.\\"The City of London Churches\\" Betjeman,J Andover, Pitkin, 1967 Its outer walls are 15th-century, with the Saxon arch doorway surviving from the original church. Many brasses remain in the interior. (The brass rubbing centre which used to be located at All Hallows is now closed). Three outstanding wooden statues of saints dating from the 15th and 16th centuries can also be found in the church, as too an exquisite Baptismal font cover which was carved in 1682 by Grinling Gibbons for ¬£12, and which is regarded as one of the finest pieces of carving in London. The main-altar's reredos mural is a post-war work by Brian Thomas. In 1999 the AOC Archaeology Group excavated the cemetery and made many significant discoveries. The church has a museum called the Undercroft Museum, containing portions of a Roman pavement which together with many artefacts was discovered many feet below the church in 1926. The exhibits focus on the history of the church and the City of London, and include Saxon and religious artefacts. Also on display are the church's registers dating back to the 16th century, and notable entries include the baptism of William Penn, the marriage of John Quincy Adams (which is the only marriage of a U.S. president that occurred on foreign soil), and the burial of Archbishop William Laud. Laud remained buried in a vault in the chapel for over 20 years; his body was moved during the Restoration to St John's College, Oxford. The altar in the crypt is of plain stone from the castle of Richard I at Athlit in The Holy Land.Ralls, Karen, Knights Templar Encyclopedia: The Essential Guide to the People, Places, events and symbols of the Order of the Temple, Career Press, 2007, p.22 All Hallows-by-the-Tower has been the guild church of Toc H since 1922. The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

In the context of the series, Omega is known as one of the founders of the Time Lords of the planet Gallifrey, and is a revered figure in Time Lord history together with the equally legendary Rassilon; the Third Doctor refers to him as the Time Lords' \\"greatest hero\\". Omega first appeared in the 10th anniversary story, The Three Doctors. The character was portrayed in The Three Doctors by actor Stephen Thorne and in Arc of Infinity by both Ian Collier and Peter Davison. Character history Omega was a stellar engineer and a member of the High Council on Gallifrey who developed the Hand of Omega, a remote stellar manipulator which could be used to control the reactions within a star. Using the Hand, Omega performed adjustments on a star near Gallifrey's in an attempt to provide a power source for the time travel experiments he conducted with Rassilon. However, Omega was thought to have been killed in the resulting supernova, which then collapsed into a black hole. Rassilon subsequently captured the nucleus of the black hole and used its power to perfect time travel technology. Rassilon then took control of Gallifrey as Lord President. The nucleus eventually became known as the Eye of Harmony, and Omega's name passed into heroic legend. Millennia later, during the events of the Doctor Who serial The Three Doctors, it was revealed that Omega had not died, but had rather been sent through the event horizon into an antimatter universe and had been trapped there since then; although he was able to shape that universe according to his will, it meant that he could not leave that universe. His exile and solitude turned him quite insane, and he sought revenge on the Time Lords for \\"abandoning\\" him. Despite the Third Doctor's assurances that he was revered among the Time Lords and still remembered fondly, Omega still sought retribution. He made two attempts in the television series to re-enter the positive matter universe: in The Three Doctors where he attempted to force the Doctor to take his place in the antimatter universe so that he could depart it, and in the serial Arc of Infinity where he attempted to create a new body for himself using the Doctor's biological data. Both attempts were thwarted by the Doctor, with his universe being destroyed in The Three Doctors when he was tricked into touching the Second Doctor's recorder‚Äîwhich had remained matter when the others were converted into antimatter‚Äîand his new body was seemingly destroyed in Arc of Infinity before it could convert back to antimatter and destroy Earth. Other appearances Omega appears as a nemesis to the Sixth Doctor in the 1986 book Search for the Doctor (written by his co-creator Dave Martin), which was part of the Make your own adventure with Doctor Who book series (Find Your Fate in the United States) . In this book, the reader must make the right choices in order to rescue the Sixth Doctor from Omega. Dave Martin's 1982 juvenile novel K9 and the Time Trap featured a character called Omegon, whose back story and role in Time Lord history is very similar to that of Omega and who also claims to have previously met the Doctor. In the New Adventures tie-in Doctor Who novels published in the 1990s, the partnership of Rassilon and Omega in Time Lord history is rounded off by the shadowy figure of the Other, in accordance with the storyline set up in the final years of the TV series by Andrew Cartmel. Some accounts suggest that Rassilon misled Omega into believing that he would survive the stellar experiment. The Doctor Who Monthly comic strip Star Death by Alan Moore (DWM #47) attributed the supernova to an attack by the Order of the Black Sun, an enemy of the Time Lords from 30,000 years in their future, the first strike (from the Time Lords' point of view) of a time war. The same story also identified the star as Qqaba. Omega also appears in the 1998 BBC Books Doctor Who novel The Infinity Doctors by Lance Parkin (which also mentioned Qqaba), although as it is never quite specified if the novel takes place in the actual Doctor Who universe or an alternate reality, whether this was the \\"real\\" Omega or an alternative version is unclear. The novel reprises various events from both television appearances, although it creates an original story from them. In this story Omega exists behind a locked door inside the light year long spacestation, the Needle, which sticks out of a black hole at the end of the universe. The Needle was formed from the remains of a TARDIS originally owned by the Time Lord Savar, who had been trying to rescue Omega from the anti- matter universe. However, once Savar arrived, Omega offered him his heart's desire. Savar panicked and tried to leave, but his TARDIS couldn't escape. Savar abandoned it in an escape unit. From the Needle, Omega learns how to create and control \\"the effect\\" a space/time anomaly that allows him to rewrite history. The novel also established the existence of Omega's wife, who after his accident became the Doctor's wife and the mother of his thirteen children. After she was shot in the matter universe (in Parkin's Virgin Missing Adventures novel Cold Fusion), Omega rescued her and brought her to his universe. The 2003 audio play Omega featured Omega as a central character and revealed that Omega's real name was Peylix, \\"Omega\\" being the grade he received at the Time Lord Academy for writing a theory about time in his exam paper that his examiner didn't agree with -- the lowest possible grade -- which stuck to him as a cruel nickname. This story also gives one of many accounts of Omega's entrapment in the antimatter universe; he uses the amputated hand of Vandekirian, a colleague opposed to Omega's plans as the system he is targeting for destruction contains sentient life, to launch his stellar manipulator. The result is an impurity in the fusion reactor which causes Omega's ship to explode, consigning him to his anti-matter prison.Parkin, Lance & Pearson, Lars (2012). A History: An Unauthorised History of the Doctor Who Universe (3rd Edition), p. 694. Mad Norwegian Press, Des Moines. . However, in addition to issues concerning the canonicity of the spin-off media and the fact that in most media, Time Lord society was founded after the supposed death of Omega, the story is largely told from the point of view of an insane Omega with confused memories. This makes the accuracy of this information uncertain. Omega in Arc of Infinity, played by Ian Collier. In Chris Roberson's short story \\"Annus Mirabilis\\" from the second volume of Tales of the Shadowmen in 2005, it is strongly indicated that the French science fiction character Doctor Omega is the First Doctor, with him assuming the name Omega as a reference to Omega the Time Lord. In the 50th Anniversary Special, the location of \\"The Moment\\", a powerful weapon, is stored on Gallifrey in the Omega Arsenal which was created by Omega himself. On 24 October 2015, Bob Baker and Paul Tams announced the film K9: TimeQuake; this was planned for release in cinemas in 2017 to feature K-9 facing off against Omega in deep space. However, as of 2020 this movie remains in development.

Its name refers to its location, inside and adjacent to London Wall, the former city wall. History The present church was constructed by George Dance the Younger in 1767,‚ÄúThe Old Churches of London‚Äù Cobb, G: London, Batsford, 1942 replacing an earlier church built some time in the early 12th century on a bastion of the old Roman wall.\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert, C;Weinreb, D;Keay, J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008) It became renowned for its hermits, who lived in cells in the church. All Hallows escaped destruction in the Great Fire of London in 1666 due to its position under the wall, but subsequently fell into dereliction. Dance rebuilt the church when he was only 24 years old.His brother Nathaniel painted the portrait above the altar \\"The City of London Churches\\" Betjeman, J Andover, Pikin, 1967 He had recently returned from Italy where he had conducted detailed studies of Classical buildings. The new All Hallows took its inspiration from the Classical world and was remarkably simple in form, with no aisles;The Visitors Guide to the City of London Churches\\" Tucker, T: London, Friends of the City Churches, 2006 its interior consists solely of a barrel-vaulted nave with a half-dome apse at the far end, with decoration deriving from the ancient Temple of Venus and Rome in the city of Rome. Attached Ionic columns support a frieze, rather than the usual entablature. The exterior is plain and of brick, except for the stone-faced tower above the porch at the west end. The Church was noted for its work in offering its services to the poor; many workers, including women in domestic service, would take the early trains into the City to avoid peak fares. A demand for services and refreshment in the Parish led to the Vicar of the Church, the Reverend Sir Montague Fowler, 4th Baronet, third son of Sir John Fowler, to operate services for their benefit. This was a popular initiative (which also had tents constructed in the Churchyard to provide refreshments) which led to the construction of the buildings behind the Church which were to be used as an educational institute. This led to the Church to having one of the largest congregations in the City at a time when many City Churches were beginning to seem redundant. All Hallows was damaged during the Second World War but was restored in the early 1960s.\\"London: the City Churches\\" Pevsner, N/Bradley, S : New Haven, Yale, 1998 It is a guild church associated with the Worshipful Company of Carpenters, which has held its annual elections in the church for over 600 years. Until 1994, it was the headquarters of the Council for the Care of Churches. On 14 December 1994 the Council for the Care of Churches and the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England moved out of All Hallows, leaving the church empty for two and a half years. Then in April 1997 the London and South East Team of Christian Aid were given use of the building and Garth Hewitt, the Team Leader, was appointed Guild Vicar and licensed by the Bishop of London on 18 June 1997. All Hallows went on to become the centre of a thriving community for Christian Aid and its supporters, becoming a centre for issues of Justice, Development and Peace. Under the wing of Christian Aid other organisations have been based at All Hallows, including the Community Fundraising Unit of Christian Aid, the Amos Trust (a small charity with a commitment to justice issues), The Time of Our Lives (the archbishop of Canterbury's Millennium youth event organised from the crypt of All Hallows), and Greenbelt festivals (an arts festival with a Christian viewpoint and a partner of Christian Aid). The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. As of 2017 the church is the headquarters of the urban youth charity XLP. The charity is focused on creating positive futures for young people in impoverished urban background areas, combating such issues as bullying and intimidation, weapons, boredom due to a lack of organised activities, absence of parents, gangs, and living in areas with high crime rate. The church is often used to host XLP events and receives an annual visit from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. City Gates Church, a congregation with roots in the British New Church Movement, currently holds their Sunday services in All Hallows. It is the first group to hold their Sunday services there since 1941 and builds on All Hallows‚Äô previous traditions. City Gates Church continues the musical traditions of the Church by hosting a choir during the week and other musical events such as carols and music nights.

It follows the story of a poor father searching post-World War II Rome for his stolen bicycle, without which he will lose the job which was to be the salvation of his young family. Adapted for the screen by Cesare Zavattini from the 1946 novel by Luigi Bartolini, and starring Lamberto Maggiorani as the desperate father and Enzo Staiola as his plucky young son, Bicycle Thieves received an Academy Honorary Award (most outstanding foreign language film) in 1950 and, in 1952 was deemed the greatest film of all time by Sight & Sound magazine's poll of filmmakers and critics; fifty years later another poll organized by the same magazine ranked it sixth among the greatest-ever films.Sight and Sound Top Ten Poll , director's list 2002. Last accessed: 2014-01-19. The film was also cited by Turner Classic Movies as one of the most influential films in cinema history, and it is considered part of the canon of classic cinema. Plot In the post-World War II Val Melaina neighbourhood of Rome, Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) is desperate for work to support his wife Maria (Lianella Carell), his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) and his small baby. He is offered a job of pasting advertising bills but tells Maria that he cannot accept because the job requires a bicycle. Maria resolutely strips the bed of her dowry bedsheetsprized possessions for a poor familyand takes them to the pawn shop, where they bring enough to redeem Antonio's pawned bicycle. On his first day of work, Antonio is atop a ladder when a young man (Vittorio Antonucci) snatches the bicycle. Antonio gives chase but is thrown off the trail by the thief's confederates. The police warn that there is little they can do. Advised that stolen goods often surface at the Piazza Vittorio market, Antonio goes there with several friends and Bruno. They find a bicycle that might be Antonio's, but the serial numbers do not match. At the Porta Portese market, Antonio and Bruno spot the thief with an old man. The thief eludes them and the old man feigns ignorance. They follow him into a church where he too slips away from them. In a subsequent encounter with the thief, Antonio pursues him into a brothel, whose denizens eject them. In the street, hostile neighbours gather as Antonio accuses the thief, who conveniently falls into a fit for which the crowd blames Antonio. Bruno fetches a policeman, who searches the thief's apartment without result. The policeman tells Antonio the case is weakAntonio has no witnesses and the neighbors are certain to provide the thief with an alibi. Antonio and Bruno leave in despair amid jeers and threats from the crowd. On their way home, they are walking near Stadio Nazionale PNF football stadium. Antonio sees an unattended bicycle near a doorway and after much anguished soul-searching, instructs Bruno to take the tram to a stop nearby and wait. Antonio circles the unattended bicycle and jumps on it. Instantly the hue and cry is raised and Brunowho has missed the tramis stunned to see his father pursued, surrounded and pulled from the bicycle. As Antonio is being muscled toward the police station, the bicycle's owner notices Bruno and in a moment of compassion tells the others to release Antonio. Antonio and Bruno then walk off slowly amid a buffeting crowd. Antonio fights back tears and Bruno takes his hand. The camera watches from behind as they disappear into the crowd.

Following the precepts of neorealism, De Sica shot only on location (that is, no studio sets) and cast only untrained nonactors. (Lamberto Maggiorani, for example, was a factory worker.) That some actors' roles paralleled their lives off screen added realism to the film.Associated Press. Published in The New York Times. Lamberto Maggiorani Obituary. April 24, 1983. Last accessed: December 30, 2007. De Sica cast Maggiorani when he had brought his young son to an audition for the film. He later cast the 8-year-old Enzo Staiola when he noticed the young boy watching the film's production on a street while helping his father sell flowers. The film's final shot of Antonio and Bruno walking away from the camera into the distance is an homage to many Charlie Chaplin films, who was De Sica's favourite filmmaker.Wakeman. pp. 232. Translated title The original Italian title is Ladri di biciclette. It literally translates into English as Bicycle Thieves, as there is no definite article and ladri is plural. The film was released as Bicycle Thieves in the United States and the United Kingdom. The poster titles were The Bicycle Thief in the US and The Bicycle Thieves in the UK. Bosley Crowther used The Bicycle Thief in his 1949 review in The New York Times, and as a result this came to be the title by which the film was known in the United States, and some people became attached to it. When the film was re-released in the late-1990s, Bob Graham, staff film critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, was quoted as saying that he preferred the title The Bicycle Thief, stating, \\"Purists have criticized the English title of the film as a poor translation of the Italian ladri, which is plural. What blindness! The Bicycle Thief is one of those wonderful titles whose power does not sink in until the film is over\\". According to critic Philip French of The Observer, the alternative title The Bicycle Thief is misleading, \\"because the desperate hero eventually becomes himself a bicycle thief\\".French, Philip. The Guardian, DVD review, February 19, 2006. Last accessed: December 30, 2007. The 2007 Criterion Collection release in North America uses the plural title.DVD Talk review of the Criterion Collection DVD, 17 Feb, 2007. De Sica changed many aspects of Bartolini's novel, but retained the title, which used the plural form and referred, in the book, to a post-war culture of rampant thievery and disrespect for civil order countered only by an inept police force and indifferent allied occupiers. Critical reception When Bicycle Thieves was released in Italy, it was viewed with hostility and as portraying Italians in a negative way. Italian critic Guido Aristarco praised it, but also complained that \\"sentimentality might at times take the place of artistic emotion.\\" Fellow Italian neorealist film director Luchino Visconti criticized the film, saying that it was a mistake to use a professional actor to dub over Lamberto Maggiorani's dialogue. Luigi Bartolini, the author of the novel from which de Sica drew his title, was highly critical of the film, feeling that the spirit of his book had been thoroughly betrayed because his protagonist was a middle- class intellectual and his theme was the breakdown of civil order. Bicycle Thieves has continued to gain very high praise from critics, with the film- review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reporting 98% positive reviews from 54 reviews, with an average 9.1 out of 10 rating. The picture is also in the Vatican's Best Films List for portraying humanistic values.United States Conference of Catholic Bishops website, 2008. Last accessed: May 20, 2008. Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, lauded the film and its message in his review. He wrote, \\"Again the Italians have sent us a brilliant and devastating film in Vittorio De Sica's rueful drama of modern city life, The Bicycle Thief. Widely and fervently heralded by those who had seen it abroad (where it already has won several prizes at various film festivals), this heart-tearing picture of frustration, which came to [the World Theater] yesterday, bids fair to fulfill all the forecasts of its absolute triumph over here. For once more the talented De Sica, who gave us the shattering Shoeshine, that desperately tragic demonstration of juvenile corruption in post-war Rome, has laid hold upon and sharply imaged in simple and realistic terms a majorindeed, a fundamental and universaldramatic theme. It is the isolation and loneliness of the little man in this complex social world that is ironically blessed with institutions to comfort and protect mankind\\".Crowther, Bosley.

They bring a grave dignity to De Sica's unblinking view of post-war Italy. The wheel of life turns and grinds people down; the man who was riding high in the morning is brought low by nightfall. It is impossible to imagine this story in any other form than De Sica's. The new black-and-white print has an extraordinary range of grey tones that get darker as life closes in\\".Graham, Bob.

The garden front, begun 1874, but later extended. The house was designed to appear as though it had evolved over centuries George Devey (1820, London ‚Äì 1886, Hastings, Sussex) was an English architect notable for his work on country houses and their estates, especially those belonging to the Rothschild family. The second son of Frederick and Ann Devey, he was born and educated in London. After leaving school he studied art, under John Sell Cotman and James Duffield HardingDavey 1995, p.22 with an ambition to become a professional artist, but later trained as an architect. Career During his professional career Devey had a London office in Great Marlborough Street, where he specialised in country houses and estate cottages and lodges. His first important work, in 1850, was on a group of cottages at the entrance gate of Penshurst Place in Kent, where he modified and added to existing buildings, to create a picturesque composition, with the intention of creating an illusion of genuine antiquity. He worked extensively for the Duke of Sutherland at Cliveden in Buckinghamshire where he designed lodges and cottages in the vernacular style of the Sussex Weald. He often used tiles and timbers on external walls, in a way evocative or earlier periods, but always in a slightly differing way to the original. This style he adapted and personalised until it had his own distinctive stamp. Devey's style was later developed by other architects such as R. N. Shaw and Charles Voysey, both of whom studied under him, and were to become be founder members of the Arts and Crafts movement a generation later. He often tried to create an artificial impression of a building's age, and of its development over time, by combining the styles and materials of different eras. For instance at St Alban's Court at Nonington in Kent he built a brick upper level over a ragstone ground floor, the irregular join giving that gives the impression the stone part was from an earlier, ruined, structure.  Commissions for the Rothschild Family Despite having been in practice since the 1850s, business was slow until he was discovered by the Rothschild family. This international dynasty of bankers would provide Devey with numerous commissions and ensure a steady stream of work. Devey first appears in Rothschild account books as the architect for a new school at Hulcott, and the rebuilding of the parsonage there. In 1863 he came to attention of Sir Anthony de Rothschild when he designed Buckland School for the vicar Edward Bonus on a site donated by the Rothschilds. He succeeded Joseph Paxton's son-in-law George H. Stokes as Baron Mayer de Rothschild's architect for the estate village at Mentmore, designing the stables and riding school there between 1869 and 1870. After the Baron's death in 1877, Devey continued in the employ of his daughter Hannah de Rothschild building cottages at Wingrave and Mentmore. His most notable works on the Mentmore Estate are: Rosebery Arms at Cheddington, the School House at Cheddington, and the Thatched Lodge, which stands at the end of a long avenue approach to Mentmore Towers. Two cottages at Mentmore designed to appear as one house, typical of thoses designed by George Devey for Hannah de Rothschild. The tall chimneys were to be a feature employed by Lutyens thirty years later Photographed circa 1968. Devey was replaced by John Aspell, the Mentmore Clerk of Works who had worked under him. Aspell continued building at Mentmore, but in a prettified version of Devey's style. Devey was largely responsible for Ascott House, a neo-Tudor extravaganza developed from a small half timbered farmhouse. He began work there in 1874 for Leopold de Rothschild. This house, conceived as a small hunting box, expanded, the intention was to make the house seem as though it had grown and developed over centuries. Devey designed numerous half timbered extensions. He was still working on the house at his death in 1886, when his partner James Williams took over the project. Ascott House is probably Devey's greatest monument, although further half timbered extensions continued to be added to this house as late as the 1930s. Devey was also responsible for the large cottages on the Green, near the entrance of Ascott House, (now the Ascott Estate Office); these are very similar to those he designed at St. Albans's Court, Kent, in the late 1880s. A further Rothschild house by Devey was Aston Clinton, where he worked with George Stokes. The Italianate house with its huge porte-cochere is now demolished, a casualty of the huge country house demolitions of the 1950s. However, the Lodge and stables by Devey still stand, as does his West Lodge at Aston Clinton. Although the records were destroyed in World War II, he is also believed to have worked on the \\"improvements\\" at Tring Park between 1874 and 1878, which involved turning a house designed by Sir Christopher Wren into a dix-huitieme French chateau complete with mansard roof. Devey later built a house very similar to the transformed Tring in Lennox Gardens, London, for a Mrs. Hunloke. Devey was capable of working on more than one project at a time. In 1876, Alice de Rothschild commissioned him to build her a house at Eythrope in the Vale of Aylesbury. After the plans were drawn up, his patroness decided water at night was bad for her health Since the house was in a bend of the River Thame, rather than abandon the site, she decided Devey must design a house without bedrooms, and she would decamp every evening to her brother's home, Waddesdon Manor. The result was the Eythrope Water Pavilion, one of the smaller of the Rothschild houses of Buckinghamshire, its design is an unostentatious complement to the great faux-chateau four miles away of Waddesdon Manor. Today (with a bedroom wing added in the 1920s) it is the only Rothschild mansion still in private hands in the Vale of Aylesbury. The Rothschilds also commissioned him to undertake work at their newly acquired property The King's Head in Aylesbury itself. His work mainly consisted of creating what was considered a typical Tudor experience in the 14th Century coaching inn, but actually followed Victorian conventions of the time. Much of his work here was not corrected until after the property was given to the National Trust, when a more authentic Tudor appearance was restored, though elements of his design can still be seen. He designedhttp://www.longwoodhants.info Longwood House in Hampshire for George Carnegie, 9th Earl of Northesk Devey had an interest in garden design and played an important role in not only the houses he designed, but also in garden buildings and follies. At Ascott this included the thatched half timbered summer house, or skating hut overlooking the circular lily pool. He has also been credited with the design of the neo-Grecian temple terminating the avenue of mirror herbaceous borders, but the style is to very different that he normally employed. Other patrons In about 1875, Richard Henry Ainsworth employed Devey to extend and modernise Smithills Hall, his home near Bolton. Personal life Devey's father was a London solicitor whose family originated from Worfield, Shropshire and Pattingham, Staffordshire. His mother, Ann, was the daughter of Durs Egg, a London gunmaker born in Switzerland and the artist Augustus Leopold Egg was a second cousin. Little is known of Devey's personal life. He never married; on the 1881 Census he is recorded living with an elderly aunt, cousin and elder brother at 12 Pelham Crescent, Hastings. He died there in November 1886. While never a household name, in the world of architecture he does have considerable standing. There is no doubt that his style was the forerunner of the arts and crafts school of design.

The directories were originally printed on yellow paper, as opposed to white pages for non-commercial listings. The traditional term \\"yellow pages\\" is now also applied to online directories of businesses. In many countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere, \\"Yellow Pages\\" (or any applicable local translations), as well as the \\"Walking Fingers\\" logo first introduced in the 1970s by the Bell System-era AT&T;, are registered trademarks, though the owner varies from country to country, usually being held by the main national telephone company (or a subsidiary or spinoff thereof). (Yell Limited is a subsidiary of Hibu, which was spun off from British Telecom.) (Yellow Pages Group is a spin-off of Bell Canada.) However, in the United States, neither the name nor the logo was registered as trademarks by AT&T;, and are freely used by several publishers. This can sometimes be very confusing as YP (AT&T;) and yellow pages are similar in nature.  History  The name and concept of \\"yellow pages\\" came about in 1883, when a printer in Cheyenne, Wyoming, working on a regular telephone directory ran out of white paper and used yellow paper instead. In 1886, Reuben H. Donnelley created the first official Yellow Pages directory. Today, the expression yellow pages is used globally, in both English-speaking and non-English speaking countries. In the United States, it refers to the category, while in some other countries it is a registered name and therefore a proper noun. The term Yellow Pages is not a registered name within the United States and is freely used by many companies. Telephone directories using the official Internet address \\"yellowpages.xx\\" (where xx is the country's top-level domain) exist in 75 different countries. They are edited by many different phone companies and directory publishers, mostly independent from each other. A particular yellow pages is a print directory which provides an alphabetical listing of businesses within a specific geographical area (e.g. the Tampa Bay area, which are segregated under headings for similar types of businesses, such as plumbers). Traditionally these directories have been published by the local phone company, but there are numerous independent directory publishers. Some yellow pages publishers focus on a particular demographic (e.g. Christian yellow pages or business pages). Yellow pages directories are usually published annually, and distributed for free to all residences and businesses within a given coverage area. The majority of listings are plain and in small black text. The yellow pages publishers generate profit by selling advertising space or listings under each heading. Advertising may be sold by a direct sales force or by approved agencies (CMR's). Available advertising space varies among publishers and ranges from bold names up to four color twin page ads (\\"double trucks\\"). In the United States, the predominant yellow pages are DEX One's DEX, the AT&T; Real Yellow Pages, Yellowbook, and the Verizon Superpages. Yellowbook Logo used in the United States Business listings used for publication are obtained by several methods. Local phone companies that publish yellow pages directories rely on their own customer lists and include business listings that are provided by incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs). Business owners that utilize phone services other than the local phone company (typically a Bell Company) should make certain that their information has been sent to the publisher for printing in upcoming directories. Advertising in yellow pages directories requires payment in full prior to printing or may be billed monthly over the life of the contract, which is usually 12 months. Typically, a sales representative will assist the customer in creating their ad design and provides a Proof Copy for review and approval. Advertisers should be aware that many contracts have automatic renewal clauses and require action on the part of the advertiser to end future billing. Yellow pages print usage is reported to be declining with both advertisers and shoppers increasingly turning to Internet search engines and online directories. According to a study by Knowledge Networks/SRI, in 2007, print yellow pages were referenced 13.4 billion times, while Internet yellow pages references increased to 3.8 billion, up from 2006's 3.3 billion online searches.New Research Shows Overall Yellow Pages Usage Growing ‚Äì 17.2 Billion Searches in 2007 As a result, most yellow pages publishers have attempted to create online versions of their print directories. These online versions are referred to as IYP or Internet yellow pages. Independent ad agencies or Internet marketing consultants can assist business owners in determining sound opportunities for yellow pages advertising and provide objective information on usage, possession and preferences. Archived yellow pages and telephone directories are important tools in local historical research and trademark litigation.  Logo  Canadian yellow pages logo The \\"Walking Fingers\\" logo was created by Henry Alexander, a well known New England artist. Upon graduation from the Swain School of Design in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Mr. Alexander began a freelance career as an illustrator and commercial designer. He formed a long association with the New England Telephone Company lasting thirty-one years. In 1962, he designed the \\"walking fingers\\" logo and within a year it became the national trademark for their yellow pages. AT&T;, the creator and owner of the most famous three-fingered version of the \\"Walking Fingers\\" logo, never applied for a trademark on the logo. While they eventually received a trademark on a different version of the logo, the version with the three fingers was not considered by AT&T; to be proprietary and they in fact allowed any telephone directory to use it. Throughout the 1970s, many cities ran television ads showing a disembodied hand \\"walking\\" across an open copy of the Yellow Pages, with the slogan \\"Let Your Fingers Do the Walking.\\" The Bell System later applied for a trademark on the logo but had their trademark denied on the grounds that it \\"had become a generic indicator of the yellow pages without regard to any particular source.\\" Shortly thereafter, Bell began using a trademarkable logo with a lightbulb instead of the walking fingers, but returned to the walking fingers two years later. In some countries, the familiar \\"walking fingers\\" logo is not protected as a trademark and may be used by anyone. This logo is used in varying forms by almost every yellow pages publisher; however, there are companies that use it to imitate mainstream publishers. In Belgium, the Republic of Ireland, Israel and the Netherlands the directory, although using the yellow pages logo, is called \\"Golden Pages\\".http://www.goldenpages.ie/displayhome.ds  Internet yellow pages  Online business directories are branded as IYP or Internet yellow pages. On a broader scale, they can be classified as vertical directories. There are consumer oriented and business oriented varieties. Providers of IYP offer online advertising. According to several reports the search term \\"yellow pages\\" was in the top 5 highest revenue generator of all search terms in Google's AdWords program in 2010. Experian/Hitwise reported in January 2011 that the search term \\"yellow pages\\" was one of the top 50 search terms across all search engines and all search terms(millions of search terms). This made \\"yellow pages\\" one of the most searched for things on the Internet in 2011. The Yellow Pages Association said in February 2011 that 75 percent of adults in the United States still used print yellow pages and that for every $1 in investment, businesses returned $15. IYP offers listings differently from standard search engines. Where search engines return results based on relevancy to the true search term, IYP returns results based on a geographic area. IYP is classified as a local search directory which provides content with the added ability to refine the search to find the needed service. The search engine prioritizes local businesses in its results rather than the results being dominated by regional or national companies. All services offer paid advertising options which typically offer preferred placement on search results pages.  Environmental concerns  In later years, the yellow pages industry faced scrutiny from environmentalist groups who claim printed yellow pages are a wasteful resource, citing statistics that by 2011 nearly 70% of all Americans rarely or never used printed phone directories. Other studies have found that a majority of consumers continue to use Yellow Pages. Approximately 58% of working U.S. adults said they use phone books at home, work or both, according to a 2013 survey by RingCentral that appeared in USA Today. The Product Stewardship Institute claims local governments spend $54 million a year to dispose of unwanted phone books and $9 million to recycle them. Phone books use low grade glues and are therefore difficult to recycle, and they often clog recycling machinery. Conversely, publishers note that phone book directories are 100% recyclable and are made using soy-based and non-toxic inks, glues and dyes. In 2011, San Francisco became the first city in the United States to restrict yellow page distribution to people who opt in, but was being sued in federal court by the Local Search Association on freedom of speech grounds. According to the Sierra Club, 1.6 million phone books were distributed annually in San Francisco, producing 3600 tons of waste, $1 million in disposal costs, and 6180 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. In 2013, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed, and the Mayor signed, an ordinance that repealed the Yellow Pages Distribution Pilot Program (Ordinance 130186). Also in 2011, Yellow Pages Association and the Association of Directory Publishers started the yellowpagesoptout.com Web site allowing anyone in the United States to choose not to receive directories. The site remains active in 2018. The 2009 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Municipal Solid Waste report classified directories as the smallest contributor of paper and paperboard products to the solid waste stream, representing only 0.3% ‚Äì significantly less than all other paper product categories such as newspapers, magazines and books. In 2010, the EPA stopped measuring directories separately from newspapers, indicating the minor impact of directories on municipal waste. Yellow Pages publishers' paper usage declined by nearly 60% between 2007‚Äì2012, and were projected to continue declining through 2013, according to the Pulp and Paper Products Council. The EPA's 2011 Municipal Waste report showed that approximately 73% of phone directory, newspaper and mechanical papers were recycled.  Decline of print directories  In September 2017, Yell, the publisher of Yellow Pages in the United Kingdom, announced that the business would be fully digitized from January 2019, ending the publication's 51-year run. The last UK copies were posted out on 18 January 2019.https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/fife/808752/sign-of-the-times- as-final-yellow-pages-are-rolled-out/ The Irish publisher of the Golden Pages moved to an online-only model in 2017 after exiting Examinership.https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/business/court-agrees- scheme-which-will-allow-golden-pages-publishers-to-exit- examinership-813432.html The equivalent \\"Independent Directory\\" (similar to the UK's Thomson Local directories) produced by Independent News & Media ceased publication in 2009.https://www.ilevel.ie/print/independent-directory- closure/  See also  * Blue pages ‚Äì government-related counterpart * Electronic Yellow Pages * List of yellow pages * Telecommunications service * Telephone directory (white pages) ‚Äì residential, non-commercial counterpart of the yellow pages * Yellowikis  References   External links   ","title":"Yellow pages"},{"id":"642751","text":"Li Yu (, given name: ‰ªô‰æ£ XiƒÅnl«ö; courtesy name: Á¨†ÁøÅ L√¨wƒìng; 1610‚Äì1680 AD), also known as Li Liweng, was a Chinese playwright, novelist and publisher.

Briefly, he also was a paramilitary leader, known for organizing the Polish Silesian Uprisings in Upper Silesia, which after World War I was contested by Germany and Poland. Korfanty fought to protect Poles from discrimination and the policies of Germanisation in Upper Silesia before the war and sought to join Silesia to Poland after Poland regained its independence. Early life He was born the son of a coal miner in Sadzawka, part of Siemianowice (at the time Laurah√ºtte), in Prussian Silesia, then German Empire. From 1895 until 1901, he studied philosophy, law, and economics, first at the Technical University in Charlottenburg (Berlin) (1895) and then at the University of Breslau, where the Marxist Werner Sombart was among his teachers. Korfanty and Sombart remained friends for many years. University of Wroc≈Çaw to celebrate the 130th anniversary of Korfanty's birth in 2003. The text reads: Student of philosophy, law, and economics at Wroc≈Çaw University; journalist, defender of Polishness, leader of the Silesian Uprisings; member of parliament and senator of the Polish Republic. In 1901, Korfanty became editor-in-chief of the Polish language paper G√≥rnoslƒÖzak (The Upper Silesian), in which he appealed to the national consciousness of the region's Polish-speaking population. In 1903, Korfanty was elected to the German Reichstag and in 1904 also to the Prussian Landtag, where he represented the independent \\"Polish circle\\" (Polskie ko≈Ço). That was a significant departure from tradition, as the Polish minority in Germany had so far predominantly supported the conservative Centre Party, which represented the large Catholic community in Germany, which felt inferior in the Protestant-dominated Reich. However, when it refused to advocate Polish minority rights (beyond the Poles' rights as Catholics), the Poles distanced themselves from it, seeking protection elsewhere. In a paper entitled Precz z Centrum (\\"Away with the Centre Party\\", 1901), Korfanty urged the Catholic Polish-speaking minority in Germany to overcome their national indifference and shift their political allegiance from supra-national Catholicism to the cause of the Polish nation. However, Korfanty retained his Christian Democratic convictions and later returned to them in domestic Polish politics. Polish restoration During World War I, in 1916, a Kingdom of Poland was proclaimed by the German and the Austro-Hungarian Empires, which was then replaced by an independent Polish state in 1918. In a Reichstag speech on 25 October 1918, Korfanty demanded that the provinces of West Prussia (including Ermeland (Warmia)) and the city of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), the Province of Posen, and parts of the provinces of East Prussia (Masuria) and Silesia (Upper Silesia) to be included in the Polish state. After the war, during the Great Poland Uprising, Korfanty became a member of the Naczelna Rada Ludowa (Supreme People's Council) in Pozna≈Ñ and a member of the Polish provisional parliament, the Constituanta-Sejm. He was also the head of the Polish plebiscite committee in Upper Silesia. He was one of the leaders of the Second Silesian Uprising in 1920 and the Third Silesian Uprising in 1921, which were Polish insurrections against German rule in Upper Silesia. The German authorities were forced to leave their positions by the League of Nations. Poland was allotted by the League of Nations roughly half of the population and valuable mining districts, which were eventually attached to Poland. Korfanty was accused by Germans of organizing terrorism against German civilians of Upper Silesia. German propaganda newspapers also \\"smeared\\" him with ordering the murder of Silesian politician Theofil Kupka.T. Hunt Tooley, \\"National identity and Weimar Germany: Upper Silesia and the eastern border, 1918-1922\\", U of Nebraska Press, 1997, p. 227, \\"But the most vicious attacks were reserved for Korfanty, who was caricatured, smeared and lampooned in every issue. The Polish leader always appeared with money and drink in hand. He appeared cavorting with prostitutes, paying the assassins of Kupka, arriving in hell\\" Polish politics Korfanty was a member of the national Sejm from 1922 to 1930 and in the Silesian Sejm (1922‚Äì1935), where he represented a Christian Democratic viewpoint. He opposed the autonomy of the Silesian Voivodship, which he saw as an obstacle against its reintegration into Poland. However, he defended the rights of the German minority in Upper Silesia because he believed that the prosperity of minorities enriched the whole society of a region. He briefly acted as vice-premier in the government of Wincenty Witos (October‚ÄìDecember 1923). From 1924, he resumed his journalist activities as editor-in-chief of the papers Rzeczpospolita (\\"The Republic\\", not to be confused with the modern newspaper of the same name) and Polonia. He opposed the May Coup of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and the subsequent establishment of Sanacja. In 1930, Korfanty was arrested and imprisoned in the Brest-Litovsk fortress, together with other leaders of the Centrolew, an alliance of left-wing and centrist parties in opposition to the ruling government. Exile In 1935, he was forced to leave Poland and emigrated to Czechoslovakia, from where he participated in the centre-right Morges Front group, founded by √©migr√©s Ignacy Paderewski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski. After the German invasion of Czechoslovakia, Korfanty moved on to France. He returned to Poland in the April 1939, after Nazi Germany had cancelled the Polish-German non-aggression pact of 1934, hoping that the renewed threat to Polish independence would help overcome the domestic political cleavage. He was arrested immediately upon arrival. In August, he was released as unfit for prison because of his bad health and died shortly afterwards, two weeks before World War II began with the German invasion of Poland. Although the cause of death remains unclear, it has been claimed that the treatment he received in prison may have caused his health to deteriorate. Legacy After 1945, when the Polish communists sought legitimisation as the champions and guarantors of Polish independence, Korfanty was finally rehabilitated as a national hero for his fight to protect the Polish population in Upper Silesia from discrimination and for his efforts to join the Polish population in Silesia to Poland. Today, many streets, places and institutions are named after him.

Among the Hemiptera and together with the Nabidae almost all species are terrestrial ambush predators: most other predatory Hemiptera are aquatic. The main examples of nonpredatory Reduviidae are some blood-sucking ectoparasites in the subfamily Triatominae. Though spectacular exceptions are known, most members of the family are fairly easily recognizable; they have a relatively narrow neck, sturdy build, and formidable curved proboscis (sometimes called a rostrum). Large specimens should be handled with caution, if at all, because they sometimes defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis. Taxonomy The Reduviidae are members of the suborder Heteroptera of the order Hemiptera. The family members are almost all predatory, except for a few blood-sucking species, some of which are important as disease vectors. About 7000 species have been described, in more than 20 recognized subfamilies, making it one of the largest families in the Hemiptera. The name Reduviidae is derived from the type genus, Reduvius. That name, in turn, comes from the Latin reduvia, meaning \\"hangnail\\" or \\"remnant\\". Possibly this name was inspired by the lateral flanges on the abdomen of many species. Common genera include: *Lopodytes *Melanolestes *Platymeris *Pselliopus *Psytalla *Rasahus *Reduvius *Rhiginia *Sinea *Zelus While members of most subfamilies have no common names other than assassin bugs, among the many subfamilies are a few with their own common names that are reasonably widely recognized, such as: *Ambush bugs - subfamily Phymatinae *Thread-legged bugs - subfamily Emesinae, including the genus Emesaya *Kissing bugs (or cone- headed bugs) - subfamily Triatominae, unusual in that most species are blood- suckers and several are important disease vectors *the species known as the \\"Wheel bug\\" - Arilus cristatus Morphology A Zelus nymph from the Southeastern United States Adult insects range from about 4.0 to 40 mm, depending on the species. They most commonly have an elongated head with a distinct narrowed 'neck', long legs, and prominent, segmented, tubular mouthparts, most commonly called the proboscis, but some authors use the term \\"rostrum\\". Most species are bright in colour with hues of brown, black, red, or orange. Nymph, found in Nepal The most distinctive feature of the family is that the tip of the proboscis fits into a ridged groove in the prosternum, where it can be used to produce sound by stridulation. Sound is made by rasping the proboscis against ridges in this groove stridulitrum (stridulatory organ). These sounds are often used to discourage predators. When harassed, many species can deliver a painful stab with the proboscis, injecting venom or digestive juices. The effects can be intensely painful and the injection from some species may be medically significant. Feeding Orange assassin bug (Gminatus australis) feeding on a beetle A reduviid camouflaged with debris, Australia Rhynocoris ‚Äì predatory flower assassin bug from South Africa, may bite when carelessly handled, painful after effects often persist for months Predatory Reduviidae use the long rostrum to inject a lethal saliva that liquefies the insides of the prey, which are then sucked out. The saliva contains enzymes that digest the tissues they swallow. This process is generally referred to as extraoral digestion. The saliva is commonly effective at killing prey substantially larger than the bug itself. The legs of some Reduviidae have areas covered in tiny hairs that aid in holding onto their prey while they feed. Others, members of the subfamily Phymatinae in particular, have forelegs that resemble those of the praying mantis, and they catch and hold their prey in a similar way to mantises. As nymphs, some species cover and camouflage themselves effectively with debris or the remains of dead prey insects. The nymphal instars of the species Acanthaspis pedestris present one good example of this behaviour where they occur in Tamil Nadu in India. Another well-known species is Reduvius personatus, known as the masked hunter because of its habit of camouflaging itself with dust. Some species tend to feed on pests such as cockroaches or bedbugs and are accordingly popular in regions where people regard their hunting as beneficial. Reduvius personatus is an example, and some people breed them as pets and for pest control. Some assassin bug subfamilies are adapted to hunting certain types of prey. For example, the Ectrichodiinae eat millipedes, and feather-legged bugs eat ants. A spectacular example of the latter is Ptilocnemus lemur, an Australian species in which the adult attacks and eats ants, but the nymph waits until the ant bites the feathery tufts on its hind legs, upon which it whips around and pierces the ant's head with its proboscis, and proceeds to feed. Some research on the nature of the venom from certain Reduviidae is under way. The saliva of Rhynocoris marginatus showed some insecticidal activity in vitro, in tests on lepidopteran pests. The effects included reduction of food consumption, assimilation, and use. Its antiaggregation factors also affected the aggregation and mobility of haemocytes. The saliva of the species Rhynocoris marginatus (Fab.) and Catamirus brevipennis (Servile) have been studied because of their activity against human pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria (including strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium) and the Gram- positive (Streptococcus pyogenes). Some species are bloodsuckers rather than predators, and they are accordingly far less welcome to humans. Triatoma species and other members of the subfamily Triatominae, such as Rhodnius species, Panstrongylus megistus, and Paratriatoma hirsuta, are known as kissing bugs, because they tend to bite sleeping humans in the soft tissue around the lips and eyes. A more serious problem than their bites is the fact that several of these haematophagous Central and South American species transmit the potentially fatal trypanosomal Chagas disease, sometimes called American trypanosomiasis. This results in the death of 12,000 people a year.https://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view;=article&id;=10&Itemid;=40743‚ü®=en Phylogeny and evolutionary history reduviid egg mass Current taxonomy is based on morphological characteristics. The first cladistic analysis based on molecular data (mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal DNA) was published in 2009 and called into question the monophyly of some current groups, such as the Emesinae. The oldest fossils of the family are from the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) aged Burmese amber, represented by nymphs and the genus Paleotriatoma, belonging to the subfamily Triatominae.

The cemetery is the burial site of a number of famous Concordians, including some of the United States' greatest authors and thinkers, especially on a hill known as \\"Authors' Ridge.\\" History A sign by the cemetery Sleepy Hollow was designed in 1855 by noted landscape architects Cleveland and Copeland, and has been in use ever since. It was dedicated on September 29, 1855; Ralph Waldo Emerson gave a dedication speech and would be buried there decades later.McAleer, John. Ralph Waldo Emerson: Days of Encounter. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984: 664. . Both designers of the cemetery had decades-long friendships with many leaders of the Transcendentalism movement and is reflected in their design. \\"Sleepy Hollow was an early natural garden designed in keeping with Emerson's aesthetic principles,\\" writes Joachim Wolschke-Bulmahn in his Nature and Ideology. In 1855, landscape designer Robert Morris Copeland delivered an address he entitled The Usefull [sic] and The Beautiful, tying his principles of naturalistic, organic garden design to Emerson's Transcendentalist principles. Shortly afterward, Copeland and his partner were retained by the Concord Cemetery Committee, of which Emerson was an active member, to design a cemetery for the growing community. On September 29, 1855, Emerson delivered the opening address of the cemetery's consecration.Emerson's address, entitled An Address to the Inhabitants of Concord at the Consecration of Sleepy Hollow, is written in Emerson's own hand and is part of the Emerson Papers at Houghton Library, Harvard University. The address contains crossed-out revisions in the text, as edited by the author. In it he lauded the designers' work. \\"The garden of the living,\\" said Emerson, was as much for the benefit for the living, to communicate their relationship to the natural world, as it was to honor the dead. By situating the monuments to the dead within a natural landscape, the architects conveyed their message, said Emerson. A cemetery could not \\"jealously guard a few atoms under immense marbles, selfishly and impossibly sequestering [them] from the vast circulations of nature [which] recompenses for new life [each decomposing] particle.\\"Nature and Ideology: Natural Garden Design in the Twentieth Century, Joachim Wolschke-Bulmahn, Published by Dumbarton Oaks, 1997 Known as Sleepy Hollow for some 20 years prior to its use as a cemetery, Emerson told his audience at the consecration ceremony that September day in Concord, \\"When these acorns, that are falling at our feet, are oaks overshadowing our children in a remote century, this mute green bank will be full of history: the good, the wise, and the great will have left their names and virtues on the trees... will have made the air tuneable and articulate.\\" To realize their vision, Emerson noted that the cemetery's designers had fitted the walks and drives into the site's natural amphitheater. They also left much of the original natural vegetation in place, instead of removing it and replanting with ornamental shrubs, as was often the case. Several years after Emerson's address, a visitor to the new cemetery noted the abundance of wild plants such as woodbine, raspberry, and goldenrod, as well as the natural moss and roots of pine trees which were left in situ by the designers.Nature and Ideology: Natural Garden Design in the Twentieth Century, Joachim Wolschke-Bulmahn, Published by Dumbarton Oaks, 1997 The Melvin Memorial, also known as Mourning Victory, sculpted by Daniel Chester French marks the grave of three brothers killed in the Civil War.
