In the 1934 Tour de France, Vietto, a relative unknown, got wings on the mountains. This was not a surprise, because he had won the Grand Prix Wolber. He was prepared for the Alps and won easily on the steepest terrain. After he won the two major Alpine stages, journalists reported that this 'boy' could be the purest mountain climber that France knew. During the 1934 Tour, he was poised to be race leader after his team leader Antonin Magne crashed during stage 16. Vietto was unaware of Magne's situation; his advantage gave him the virtual race lead. A marshal on a motorcycle caught Vietto to inform him his captain was on the side of the road, with team-mate Lap√©bie ahead, and the other team-mates behind the yellow jersey. Vietto turned and rode back up the mountain into the descending riders (at the time, reversing course was legal, but is no longer so), to give Magne his bike. Magne mounted Vietto's bike and with Lap√©bie closed the gap to preserve his overall lead and win the Tour. A photograph shows Vietto sitting on a stone wall as the race passes. This made him a star in France. The image of a 20-year-old who sacrificed his chance of winning the Tour doubled his popularity. Vietto was nevertheless named the Tour's best climber; he finished 5th overall, almost 1 hour behind Magne. Vietto never won the Tour. He was closest in 1939, when he gained the yellow jersey in Lorient in one of the first stages, but in the mountains, once his favorite place, he was left by Sylv√®re Maes. After that Tour, war broke out and the race wasn't held until 1947. Vietto, still loved, attacked from the second stage. As a result, he took the yellow jersey in Brussels, to lose it two days before the finish, in a time trial of 139 km. Despite failing to hold the lead, Vietto wore the yellow jersey for 15 stages during the 1938 Tour de France and during the 1947 Tour de France for 14 stages. He finished second in 1939, fifth in 1934 and 1947 and eighth in 1935. Until Fabian Cancellara broke his record in the 2012 Tour de France, Vietto had the highest career yellow jersey statistics of anyone to never win the Tour de France overall. Vietto lost a toe to sepsis in 1947. Legend has it\\"Lance Armstrong's War, p. 101, and Les Woodland's \\"The Yellow Jersey Companion to the Tour de France\\" that Vietto insisted his domestique, Apo Lazarides, cut off one of his own toes to match. According to legend, Vietto's toe is in formaldehyde in a bar in Marseilles.

The game follows Naija, an aquatic humanoid woman, as she explores the underwater world of Aquaria. Along her journey, she learns about the history of the world she inhabits as well as her own past. The gameplay focuses on a combination of swimming, singing, and combat, through which Naija can interact with the world. Her songs can move items, affect plants and animals, and change her physical appearance into other forms that have different abilities, like firing projectiles at hostile creatures, or passing through barriers inaccessible to her in her natural form. After more than two years of development, the game was released in late 2007 for Windows. A port of the game to Mac OS X was released in 2008 by Ambrosia Software, and an updated version of the game was released on the Steam service that same year. A Linux version of the game was released as part of the first Humble Indie Bundle collection in 2010, a version for the iPad was released in 2011, and an Android version debuted in 2013 alongside another Humble Bundle collection. In 2009, an album with the Aquaria soundtrack was released. It includes all of the music in the game, as well as a new nine-minute vocal track and a few remixes. Reviews of the game were generally positive. Critics focused primarily on the visuals, music, and atmosphere as being particularly praiseworthy. The controls and gameplay were also lauded, while negative critiques more often centered on the map system and limited variety of objectives. The game won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Festival in March 2007. Gameplay alt=An aquatic humanoid woman swims to the left of the screen. A large seahorse floats behind her, while a larger green seahorse floats to the right. Plants and rock formations are seen around her and in the background in a faded green. Aquaria is a 2D side-scrolling action-adventure game, heavily focused on exploration and puzzle-solving, with non-linear gameplay. The player controls Naija, a lone underwater dweller; although similar to a human woman, Naija also has several fish-like qualities, such as the ability to breathe underwater and propel herself quickly with webbed feet. The game, originally only available for personal computers, was designed to be primarily controlled solely through the mouse, though it can also be controlled with a keyboard or Xbox 360 controller. The player directs Naija through an underwater world composed of several distinct regions, ranging from caves to underwater ruins to sunlit oases. These areas are filled with plant and animal life, which can be hostile, friendly, or neutral towards her. Hostile plants and animals can hurt Naija, reducing her health meter, by touching her or firing projectiles at her. In general, Naija cannot interact directly with objects in the world. Instead, the majority of actions are accomplished through singing short tunes. The player does this by selecting a series of notes displayed in a circle of eight choices in the correct order. Each note corresponds with a different color. Singing notes affects plants and objects of the same color as the note, while singing the tunes, once learned through the plot, can lift objects, create a shield around Naija, or change Naija into different \\"forms\\" which have different appearances and unique abilities critical to overcoming the various challenges and obstacles found in the game. The specific tones that are played when the player selects a note can subtly change in different regions, matching the background music. The default form, or \\"normal form\\", is the only one in which Naija can sing, and is the only one where her appearance is modifiable by the player by having Naija wear costumes found throughout the game. Other forms, which can only be used once found in-game, are the \\"energy form\\", in which Naija can shoot projectiles to attack enemy creatures, \\"beast form\\", which allows Naija to swim faster through the water and eat small fish to restore health, and \\"nature form\\", in which Naija can shoot seeds that produce flowers and spiky plants that can harm other creatures. In this form, Naija is not harmed by thorns on any plants. The player can also learn the \\"sun form\\", which allows Naija to give off light in dark regions, \\"spirit form\\", which allows the player to move to specific locations marked by blue crystals without time passing, \\"fish form\\", where Naija turns into a small, fast fish, and \\"dual form\\", found at the end of the game, which allows Naija and another character named Li who is met late in the game's plot to merge, with actions taken by one affecting the other. While exploring the world, Naija can collect various ingredients from interaction with plants and animals, mainly by combating her foes. These ingredients can be used to cook dishes, which have varying effects on Naija. The most common effects are healing and enhancing various characteristics such as speed and defense, but there are some more exotic dishes which grant her new abilities. The player can learn new recipes by collecting new dishes directly, but can also learn them by combining ingredients without first knowing the recipe. Plot alt=An aquatic humanoid woman surrounded by a light flare. Energy projectiles stream from her towards several small red creatures. Plants and rock formations are seen around her and in the background. As the game opens, Naija has lost almost all of her memories, and is unaware of the world outside of her home as she \\"lives as a simple creature\\". The player is told this in voice-over narrations in the form of a story told by a future Naija. These narrations serve as the primary source of information about Naija throughout the game, though there are occasional cutscenes. After being confronted by a shadowy figure and being shown a series of flashbacks she does not understand, Naija awakens. Feeling loneliness as the only member of her species, Naija decides to explore the world around her. As the player explores, Naija discovers more and more about the history of the world, \\"Aquaria\\", and about her own past. The player is not forced to go through the plotline in a set sequence. The only limiting factor is physical barriers such as areas that can be accessed only by using a specific form. Combinations of these physical limitations place some plot elements later in the game. The narrative for the majority of the game is centered on Naija's exploration of a series of ruined civilizations that she finds, each with a large monster in them. These civilizations make up the different regions of the game. Towards the end of the game, Naija discovers that all of the ruined civilizations she has found throughout the game were destroyed by a god, \\"the Creator\\", who was jealous of the rising power of that civilization or of their gods. The powerful monsters she has found and defeated in each region were once the gods of that civilization. Each of these civilizations had a unique power, symbolized by the form that Naija learns after defeating their former gods. Along with Li, a human diver from the land she meets at the top of the ocean, Naija then descends to the bottom of the sea to confront the god. There she discovers that the Creator fell into the ocean as a child, and bonded with an ancient spirit to gain god-like powers. He then created Aquaria, threading a verse of a lullaby his mother had sung to him throughout, the only part of the song he remembers. The melody of this song, the \\"verse\\", is what allows Naija to sing songs that affect the world around her; parts of the melody can be heard in different forms in the songs within the game's soundtrack. The Creator, after creating Aquaria, created a series of civilizations, making a new one in turn when each one was destroyed. The Creator kidnaps Li, with whom Naija has fallen in love, and she attacks the Creator to get him back. The player defeats the god as the final boss of the game, and returns home with Li. In the epilogue, Naija is shown with Li and their child. If the player has found all of Naija's memories by discovering places she remembers, they reveal that the shadowy figure at the beginning of the game was her mother, Mia. Mia was made by the Creator and had the ability, like Naija, to use the different powers of all of the civilizations. She fled the Creator, and hid herself and Naija among several communities in succession; after the destruction of the last one she erased Naija's memory so that she would find out the history of Aquaria on her own and defeat the Creator. In the extended epilogue shown if the player has found all of the memories, Mia appears, telling Naija that the two of them can conquer the civilisations above the water. After Naija refuses, Mia kidnaps her, and vanishes; the extended epilogue ends with Lucien‚ÄîNaija and Li's son‚Äîleaving to find her. If the player has not found all of the memories, the epilogue instead ends with Naija asking the player to find out about her past, and revealing that the narration of the game was intended to be heard by her son. Development alt=An aquatic humanoid woman with green skin, large ears, and white hair. She is wearing a metal swimsuit, bracers and shin guards, and is raising her left hand to the viewer. Aquaria was developed by Derek Yu and Alec Holowka over the course of two years, off of a concept that Holowka had thought of a year prior. Yu was the lead artist, and Holowka handled the programming and audio components. Both designers had previously worked in video games; Yu had made several freeware games, including I'm O.K with Holowka and others, while Holowka had worked for several video game start-ups, none of which had ever gotten a game published. Some additional work on the game, including some level design and scripting for some enemies, was done by Brandon McCartin. Holowka and Yu officially formed the studio Bit Blot to back the game a week before submitting it to the 2007 Independent Games Festival. Aquaria was the studio's only game. Both members of the team continued to make video games, but not as a partnership; Holowka went on to form a separate team called Infinite Ammo, and Yu went on to work on Spelunky. The initial prototype of the game had styling similar to a text-based role- playing game, with a large open world and many sub-quests. After moving towards \\"multiple-choice text answers\\" and a complicated gameplay system, the team decided to simplify the game and set the 2007 Independent Games Festival as a deadline to complete everything. With this time pressure, they forced themselves to cut out a lot of what they felt was unneeded complexity, bringing the game to its core. After removing many of what they decided were extraneous elements they then added back in the cooking system, which they felt fit well with the rest of the game, as well as a map system. They then developed the game world and story in a roughly linear manner, creating basic designs of each region and then coming back to fill in details. They felt that this allowed them to create interesting ideas at the beginning of the game and then fill them out and resolve them at the end. One of these ideas was that of the \\"verse\\"; Holowka realized partway through development that he had been using the same twelve-note sequence transposed into different keys throughout the music, and realized that the idea of a pervasive musical theme to the world fit with the story. The game also includes a level and animation editor; several mods have been made for the game. The game was developed to be able to be controlled by the player with only the mouse, after it was suggested by Yu's father. The developers felt that this control scheme forced them to make the gameplay fluid and easy to grasp, though they also added the option to control the game with a keyboard or Xbox 360 controller. Yu and Holowka considered the \\"hallmark\\" of exploratory games to be a sense of loneliness, which they made a part of the narrative, but also wanted the player to get a sense of Naija's character. To that end, they used voice-overs to demonstrate to the player what Naija was feeling during key points of the game. The voice of Naija was performed by Jenna Sharpe, who was chosen after auditioning several other voice actresses. She additionally sang the vocals for one song on the soundtrack, \\"Lost to the Waves\\". She also sang a nine-minute vocal piece, \\"Fear the Dark\\", for the release of the Aquaria soundtrack album, which was published by Bit Blot on November 14, 2009. The album features 50 tracks on two discs, including all of the music in the game as well as the new vocal track and a few remixes. The game was released for Windows computers on December 7, 2007. A patch was later released which added new functionality to the in-game map, added widescreen support, and tweaked several game settings. A Macintosh port was released November 13, 2008, courtesy of Ambrosia Software. The game was released on Steam on December 15, 2008; it included the addition of 27 Steam Achievements. A Linux version of the game was developed by Ryan C. Gordon in 2009; an open beta ran until February 6, 2010, and the Linux version of the game was released as part of the first Humble Indie Bundle. The source code for the game's engine was released under the GNU General Public License on June 3, 2010. A modified version was released on the iPad on November 2, 2011. This version, which includes touchscreen support and changes to the way the map works, was created by Andrew Church, who was approached to do the port by Holowka after he did an unofficial PlayStation Portable source port. The Humble Bundle with Android 6 collection, which was launched on June 18, 2013, debuted an Android version of Aquaria. Reception Aquaria was the Seumas McNally Grand Prize winner of the 2007 Independent Games Festival, and was also a finalist in the categories of Design Innovation, Excellence in Visual Art, and Excellence in Audio. The festival praised the game's \\"fluid controls, unique, non-linear gameplay, and vibrant hand-drawn storybook-style graphics\\". The game received praise from many different reviewers; Cam Shea of IGN called it \\"a stunning effort from such a small team\\", Richard Naik of GameCritics called it \\"an extremely high- quality product\\" and a fine example of the side-scroller genre, while Chris Dahlen of The A.V. Club termed it \\"not so much a retro adventure as a fresh take on everything that made the old 2D adventures great\\". Praise for the game was centered primarily on its visuals and atmosphere. Hypers Tim Henderson commended the game for \\"a rare and genuine sense of exploration, wonder and discovery\\". A review by Scott Colbourne from The Globe and Mail termed Aquaria \\"drop-dead beautiful\\" with a \\"deep and affecting story\\" and summarized it as \\"a game you can get comfortably lost in\\". alt=Two men stand behind a podium marked Independent Games Festival, while a woman in a blue dress stands to the left. Other reviewers, such as Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer and Chris Holt of Macworld echoed the praises for the graphics and atmosphere, while Craig Pearson of PC Gamer UK added praises for the music and voiceovers and Suzie Ochs of MacLife praised the music and story. Other praises for the game came for its control scheme and for the gameplay mechanics, with Holt calling out the cooking system as worthy of praise. Though noting that the visuals and presentation of the game would be the first thing players noticed, Nathan Cocks of PC PowerPlay claimed that \\"from a design standpoint, Aquaria is a triumph,\\" with the right amount of complexity and level design that is \\"spot on\\". Several reviewers, such as Bramwell and Holt, criticized the map system present in the initial version of the game as being confusing and difficult. Other reviewers had different concerns, such as Henderson, who critiqued the initial release version for \\"lack of widescreen support and being occasionally fiddly\\", or Naik, who felt that the control scheme was not as intuitive when using an Xbox 360 controller. Shea and Pearson felt that the game could have used more puzzles or a wider variety of quests and objectives to balance out the exploration and combat. They did not feel, though, that these downsides compared to the game's positives, with Pearson saying that \\"the good far outweighs what are, essentially, niggles.\\"  References  External links  * Category:2007 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Ambrosia Software games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Art games Category:Commercial video games with freely available source code Category:Fantasy video games Category:Indie video games Category:IOS games Category:Linux games Category:Lua (programming language)-scripted video games Category:MacOS games Category:Metroidvania games Category:Seumas McNally Grand Prize winners Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Windows games ","title":"Aquaria (video game)"},{"id":"10067653","title":"Wan Yai District"},{"id":"10067654","text":"The Old Parliament House (, Pale√° Voul√≠) at Stadiou Street in Athens, housed the Greek Parliament between 1875 and 1935. It now houses the country's National Historical Museum. History Interior The site was occupied originally by the house of the Athenian magnate and politician, Alexandros Kontostavlos. After Athens became the capital of Greece in 1833, King Otto selected it as temporary residence, pending the construction of the Royal Palace (which houses Parliament currently). In 1835, a large dance and banquet hall was added to the house, and after the 1843 Revolution, which forced King Otto to grant a constitution, the National Assembly convened here. In October 1854, however, the house burned down in a fire. Construction of a new building then began in August 1858, with the foundation laid by Queen Amalia, on plans by French architect Fran√ßois Boulanger. Construction was halted the next year due to lack of funds, and not restarted until after Otto was deposed in 1863; the plans were then modified by the Greek architect Panagiotis Kalkos, and construction was complete by 1871. During the interim, Parliament had been housed on the back of the square in a brick building, hastily erected in 1863, which became colloquially known as \\"the Shanty\\" (Œ∑ Œ†Œ±œÅŒ¨Œ≥Œ∫Œ±). Bronze statue of Theodoros Kolokotronis, by sculptor Lazaros Sochos, in front of the Parliament House The old Greek land flag flying over the Parliament The Hellenic Parliament would remain in the building from 1875 until its move to its current location in the Old Palace in 1935. As such, it witnessed some of the most turbulent and important events in modern Greek history, including the assassination of Prime Minister Theodoros Deligiannis on the Parliament steps on 13 June 1905, and the declaration of the Republic on 25 March 1924. After the parliament was moved, the building housed the Ministry of Justice. In 1961 the building underwent extensive restoration and became the seat of the National History Museum, administered by the Historical and Ethnological Society of Greece. Kolokotronis statue In front of the building stands a large bronze equestrian statue of General Theodoros Kolokotronis. The bronze statue of the commander in chief of the Revolution of 1821 is a work of sculptor Lazaros Sochos (1862-1911), and was originally placed (1904) at the beginning of Kolokotronis street. It was transferred to its current location in 1954, during the restoration of the Old Parliament Building, in order to signal the link of the museum with the city. Its pedestal features bronze reliefs of the Battle of Dervenakia, and of a session of the Peloponnesian Senate during the Greek Revolution. The statue faces Stadiou Street; Kolokotronis turns his head towards the Parliament House and his hand is pointing the opposite way where, during the 19th century, the Royal Mews were located. According to a popular joke, the hero of the Revolution was showing parliamentarians that, because of their subservience to the King, the stables were their rightful place.  The National Historical Museum  The museum houses the collection of the Historical and Ethnological Society of Greece (IEEE), founded in 1882. It is the oldest collection of its kind in Greece, and prior to its transfer to the Old Parliament, was housed in the main building of the National Technical University. The collection contains historical items concerning the period from the capture of Constantinopolis by the Ottomans in 1453 to the Second World War, emphasizing especially the period of the Greek Revolution and the subsequent establishment of the modern Greek state. Among the items displayed are weapons, personal belongings and memorabilia from historical personalities, historical paintings by Greek and foreign artists, manuscripts, as well as a large collection of traditional costumes from the various regions of Greece. The collection is displayed in the corridors and rooms of the building, while the great central hall of the National Assembly is used for conferences.

The brother serves as a stand in to the bride, and any resulting children are considered children of the deceased spouse. This unusual type of marriage is nearly exclusive to the Dinka (Jieng), Nuer, and Atuot people of South Sudan although instances of such marriages have also occurred in France. These tribes overlap in cultural practices, potentially due to the fact that all of these tribes are cattle-herding pastoralists.  Nuer People  Nuer women do not marry deceased men only to continue the man's bloodline. In accordance to Nuer tradition, any wealth owned by the woman becomes property of the man after the marriage. This wealth that is transferred is in the form of cattle, being exchanged from the father's lineage to the mother's lineage. Once this exchange is completed, the male children of that woman who received the cattle can now marry. Thus, a wealthy woman may marry a deceased man to retain her wealth, instead of giving it up after marrying. Among the Nuer, a ghost marriage is nearly as common as a marriage to a live man.  Atuot People  There was a decline in ghost marriage among the Atuot people in the 1970s, and some sources attributed it to a connection with the cattle trade.

After high school he enrolled at Eastman to study trombone with Emory Remington and composition with Louis Mennini and Bernard Rogers. Soon after graduating in 1956, he travelled to England for composition study with Peter Racine Fricker, intending to stay a few months. He began freelancing on trombone and bass trumpet, becoming a regular in the London jazz scene with groups like the Kenny Baker Dozen. In 1958, he won the bass trombone position in the Philharmonia Orchestra, where he performed for the next 30 years. In 1958 he married Susan Talbot, with whom had two daughters. As a session musician, he worked with Frank Sinatra, Oscar Peterson, Ella Fitzgerald, the Rolling Stones, and the Beatles (on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band). In 1964 he joined the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble, for which he wrote several pieces; he remained a member until Jones's retirement in 1987. He co-directed and composed for the Bobby Lamb/Ray Premru Big Band. After a term as a sabbatical replacement at Eastman, he decided in 1988 to retire from the Philharmonia and return to the U.S. to accept a professorship at Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio. He continued to perform occasionally and to compose. In 1990 he married Janet Jacobs. In 1997 he was awarded the Cleveland Arts Prize for music. During the same year he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, and he died at the Cleveland Clinic the following May at the age of 63. Music Premru‚Äôs compositional output runs from jazz arrangements to choral works, and includes pieces commissioned by numerous leading orchestras, festivals and organizations. In 1962, he did work on the feature film Reach for Glory in the capacity as music conductor.The LIBRARY of CONGRESS Jazz on the Screen, A jazz and blues filmography by David Meeker REACH FOR GLORY / Philip Leacock [motion picture] In a 1981 interview with Capital Radio, he cited as influences the music of Berg, Prokofiev, Bart√≥k and Ives, in addition to jazz and early Bach studies. Throughout his career his language remained one of relatively conservative mid-century modernism, with a bent toward gentle lyricism; though he wrote some works in a lighter vein, and jazz idioms and techniques pop up in even his most ‚Äúserious‚Äù scores. His large-scale works include concertos for Trombone (1956), Trumpet (1983), and Tuba (1992); Music for Three Trombones, Tuba and Orchestra (1985); a Concerto for Orchestra (1976); and two symphonies (1981 and 1988). Most were commissioned and premiered by major ensembles (the symphonies by the Philharmonia and Cleveland orchestras, with conductors Lorin Maazel and Vladimir Ashkenazy, respectively); however none have been commercially recorded as of 2007 and only the Trumpet and Tuba concertos remain in print (also as of 2007). Perhaps his most lasting legacy is in his chamber works for brass, several of which remain available in print and on recordings, including: the Concertino for trombone and woodwind quartet (1954); Music from Harter Fell (1973) and the nine-movement Divertimento (1976), both for the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble; the Brass Quartet of 1960; Two Pieces for three trombones (1951); and In Memoriam (1956) and the Tissington Variations (1970), both for trombone quartet.

In his capacity as the eleventh Susuhunan, Pakubuwono XI was an officer √† la suite of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL). He was made a Major General of the KNIL on April 15, 1939.  Heir apparent  Born as Raden Mas Ontoseno, he was the son of Pakubuwono X and his concubine Kanjeng Raden Ayu Mandojoretno. Upon reaching adulthood, he was styled Kanjeng Gusti Pangeran Haryo Hangabehi. He was crowned as Susuhunan Pakubuwana XI on April 26, 1939. The appointment of KGPH. Hangabehi as Pakubuwono XI wasn't without conflict, due to Pakubuwono X's preference to KGPH. Koesoemojoedo (Gusti Raden Mas Abimanjoe), KGPH. Hangabehi's younger brother, to succeed him. Moreover, from the Dutch colonial government's point of view, KGPH. Koesoemojoedo was a strong-personality Javanese nobleman who interested in the court's financial and administration affairs. In another side, KGPH. Hangabehi's position was also strong, mainly from majority of anti-Dutch court's elites. Pakubuwono X himself had more than 60 children. A wedging problem was that Pakubuwono X had no son from his two queen consorts. The eldest sons, KGPH. Hangabehi and KGPH. Koesoemojoedo, were born from concubines. In 1898, Pakubuwono X had actually intended to appoint KGPH. Koesoemojoedo as a crown prince although he was born 40 days after KGPH. Hangabehi's birth. However, Pakubuwono X abandoned his plan, and he chose KGPH. Hangabehi as the heir. KGPH. Hangabehi was given many important positions, such as wedana tengen (chancellor) and Vice-Chairman of Raad Nagari, a royal advisory council. He was also tasked by his father to attend 40th jubilee of Queen Wilhelmina's coronation in the Netherlands. Reign In the late November 1938, Pakubuwono X was severely ill, and died 3 months later. On the advice of Parliament of the Netherlands, Governor-General Alidius Warmoldus Lambertus Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer chose KGPH. Hangabehi to succeed his father as Pakubuwono XI. Pakubuwono XI's coronation was accompanied by political contract which reduced susuhunan's suzerainity, which mentioned that Pakubuwono XI would be deposed if he couldn't fulfill his obligation as determined in political contract, plus the withholding of royal expenditure budget dramatically. Pakubuwono XI's reign was marked by difficult era, coincided with World War II. He also experienced the transfer of colonial government, from the Netherlands to Japan since 1942. The Japanese dubbed Surakarta Sunanate as Solo Koo. In Japanese colonial era, there was inflation which severed royal and nobility's finances. The Japanese also confiscated most of court's assets, which caused Pakubuwono XI fell ill. After his death on June 1, 1939, he was succeeded by his very young son, styled Pakubuwono XII.

It was located between Whitecross Street and the modern Golden Lane, just outside the City of London. It was founded about 1600, and suppressed by the Puritan Parliament in 1642. History=Origins Enlarge The Fortune Theatre was contemporary with Shakespeare's Globe, The Swan and others; it stood in the parish of St Giles- without-Cripplegate, to the west of the Shoreditch locations of The Theatre and the Curtain Theatre, between Whitecross Street and Golden Lane in what is today named Fortune Street, just outside the City of London. Between 1600 and 1642, it was among the chief venues for drama in London. The site is said to have originally been occupied by a nursery for the children of Henry VIII.William Pulleyn, The Etymological Compendium (London: Thomas Tegg, 1828), p. 67Priscilla Wakefield, Perambulations in London (London: Darton, Harvey and Darton, 1814), Letter XXIV, p. 345 The Fortune was erected as the second half of a substantial realignment of London's chief acting companies. In 1597, the Lord Chamberlain's Men had left, or rather been ejected, from The Theatre; they abandoned Shoreditch and in 1599 constructed a new theatre, the Globe, in Southwark. The Admiral's Men, then playing in the nearby and aging Rose Theatre, suddenly faced stiff competition for Bankside audiences. At this point, the Admiral's manager Philip Henslowe and his stepson-in-law, the leading actor Edward Alleyn, made plans to move to Shoreditch; Alleyn appears to have funded the new theatre, later selling half-interest to his father-in- law. They paid ¬£240 for a thirty-year lease on a plot of land between tenements on Golding and Whitecross Lane. They hired Peter Street, who had just finished building the Globe, to make them a playhouse. Street was paid ¬£440 for the construction job; with another ¬£80 spent for painting and incidental expenses, the cost of the physical building was ¬£520. The total expenses for the project, including the securing of property rights and clearances of previous leases, came to ¬£1,320.Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 435-6. Maintaining the theatre cost about ¬£120 per year in the first decade of its existence.Gurr, p. 139. Because the contract for the construction was preserved among Alleyn's papers, a good deal more is known about the Fortune than about the other outdoor theatres. The document also casts some light on the features of the Globe, since Henslowe and Alleyn planned their theatre with an eye on their rival's venue; many of the details in the contract are for sizes equal to or bigger than the Globe's equivalent. Design A depiction of the Fortune in a stained glass memorial to Edward Alleyn The plot of land on which the theatre sat was approximately square, across and deep. The theatre was built on a foundation of lime and brick; square-shaped (uniquely among the period's amphitheatres), each wall measured eighty feet outside and fifty-five within. The building was three stories tall; the first- floor galleries were twelve feet high, those on the second floor eleven; those on the third, nine. Each row of galleries was twelve feet deep. Henslowe and Alleyn specified that the Fortune outdo the Globe \\"in every point for scantlings\\"; they also provided, in accordance with common practice, for two- penny rooms and gentlemen's rooms. The building was constructed of lath and plaster, with wood floors in the galleries. The stage, and tiring-house, were thrust forward into the middle of the square. The tiring-house had glazed windows; the manner of its attachment to the stage is unknown but presumably similar to that of the Swan. The stage was forty-three feet across; it was covered with tile. First theatre Plaque in Fortune Street, London Henslowe and Alleyn's plans met with considerable opposition from the neighbourhood and city officials. With the aid of their patron, Charles Howard, the Lord Admiral, they secured permission from the Privy Council for the venture. Henslowe seems also to have soothed his neighbors' worries by pledging substantial amounts to charity in the parish. The theatre housed the Admiral's Men by late 1600, as revealed by correspondence of the Venetian ambassador in London. This troupe remained as tenants for more than two decades, surviving the deaths of both Henslowe and Alleyn, and remaining fairly stable under the successive patronage of Prince Henry and Lord Palsgrave. Upon Henslowe's death, Alleyn assumed full control of the property. Originally described as the \\"fairest play-house in the town,\\" the Fortune suffered a slow decline in reputation over the decades. In 1605, notorious roisterer Mary Frith may have appeared on the boards, singing and playing a lute; it is not clear from the consistory court records in which this event is described if the players were a party to her antics. In 1612, the theatre was mentioned by name in a city order suppressing the post-performance jigs, which authorities believed led to fist-fights and thefts. That this belief had some merit is suggested by a case the next year, in which a country farmer stabbed a city gentleman. In 1614, Thomas Tomkiss's academic play Albumazar linked the Fortune and the Red Bull Theatre as raucous places to see old-fashioned fare such as The Spanish Tragedy. The aspersion stuck, as did the conjunction of north-side theatres. Yet the conventional view should not be exaggerated; on one and perhaps two occasions, ambassadors visited the theatre. On the first and less certain occasion, a member of the Venetian delegation, Orazio Busino, describes a visit in December 1617 to a theatre that may have been the Fortune. On the second, the notorious Gondomar certainly visited Alleyn and the others there in 1621; after the performance the players held a banquet in his honour. Second theatre On 9 December 1621, the Fortune burned to the ground, taking with it the company's stock of plays and properties. To meet the ¬£1000 cost of rebuilding, Alleyn formed a partnership of twelve sharers, each paying an initial amount of ¬£83 6s. 8d. By then aged and busy with Dulwich College, he took only one share for himself, and leased the property to the company's sharers for ¬£128 per year. (The shareholders paid Alleyn ¬£10 13s. 10d. each annually, and in return split the profits of the theatre, and the expenses of running it, twelve ways.)Kinney, p. 160. The theatre re-opened in March 1623. When Alleyn died in 1626, the College assumed control of the lease; the actor Richard Gunnell became its manager. Yet this change does not appear to have changed operations at the theatre. The new theatre appears to have been made of brick, with a lead and tile roof as fire-proofing measure. It also seems to have been round, abandoning its unconventional square shape. The reputation of the theatre did not improve after its reconstruction. In 1626, it was the scene of a riot involving sailors, in the course of which a constable was assaulted. In 1628, a prot√©g√© of Buckingham was assaulted by a mob after leaving a performance there. In 1631, Palsgrave's Men moved to the playhouse at Salisbury Court; they were replaced at the Fortune by the actors of the King's Revels. The only play definitely associated with this period is a comedy, now lost, by William Heminges, son of John Heminges. In 1635, a company that had been at the Red Bull Theatre occupied the theatre, only to meet a notable run of bad fortune: plague closed the theatres for more than a year, from May 1636 to October 1637. Since they had no income from the theatre, the twelve shareholders in the theatre fell seriously arrears in their payments to Dulwich College, by more than ¬£165.Adams, p. 288. In 1639, the actors were fined ¬£1000 for depicting a religious ceremony on stage - this depiction was taken as anti-Catholic, but in the late 1630s, almost any reference to religion was risky. This group returned to the Red Bull at Easter 1640, and the remnants of Palsgrave's company, now under the patronage of the young Prince Charles and therefore called Prince Charles's Men, returned to the Fortune. When Parliament ordered all theatres closed in 1642, the Fortune entered a slow but irreversible decline. The actors at least occasionally violated the order, for they were raided and their property seized during a performance almost a year after the closure; between the expiration of the original order and the enactment of new, more stringent orders in 1649, the players returned to the theatre. In 1649, soldiers pulled down the stage and the gallery seats. By the Restoration, it had partially collapsed, and the masters of Dulwich sold what remained as scrap. Replica theatres The Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum in Tokyo, based on the Fortune. The 1599 contract for building the Fortune Theatre was found in the papers of theatrical manager Philip Henslowe at Dulwich College. The contract gives some overall dimensions of the Fortune but there are no plans or elevations. *The New Fortune Theatre at the University of Western Australia in Perth, opened in 1964, was the first known replica of the original building. *The Allen Elizabethan Theatre at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon, designed by Richard L. Hay, uses the dimensions from the contract but the stage's appearance and arrangements are speculation, as the original plans have never been found. *The Waseda University Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum in Tokyo, Japan, is also modelled after the playhouse. *The Gda≈Ñsk Shakespeare Theatre in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland, is built on the site of a 17th-century theatre, known as the Gda≈Ñsk Fencing School, which is believed to have been modelled on the first Fortune Theatre. Though not an exact reproduction, the modern theatre incorporates elements from the designs of the earlier theatres.

It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2015, as the total effective population probably consists of fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, with a decreasing population trend. On both Sunda islands, it is threatened by deforestation. In 2006, it was classified as a species, distinct from the clouded leopard in mainland Southeast Asia. Its fur is darker with a smaller cloud pattern. It is also known as the Indonesian clouded leopard, Sundaland clouded leopard, Enkuli clouded leopard, Diard's clouded leopard, and Diard's cat.  Characteristics  The Sunda clouded leopard is overall grayish yellow or gray hue. It has a double midline on the back and is marked with small irregular cloud-like patterns on shoulders. These cloud markings have frequent spots inside and form two or more rows that are arranged vertically from the back on the flanks. It can purr as its hyoid bone is ossified. Its pupils contract to vertical slits. It has a stocky build and weighs around . Its canine teeth are long, which, in proportion to the skull length, are longer than those of any other living cat. Its tail can grow to be as long as its body, aiding balance.  Distribution and habitat  The Sunda clouded leopard is restricted to the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. In Borneo, it occurs in lowland rainforest, and at lower density in logged forest below . In Sumatra, it appears to be more abundant in hilly, montane areas. It is unknown if it still occurs on the Batu Islands close to Sumatra. Between March and August 2005, tracks of clouded leopards were recorded during field research in the Tabin Wildlife Reserve in Sabah. The population size in the research area was estimated to be five individuals, based on a capture- recapture analysis of four confirmed animals differentiated by their tracks. The density was estimated at eight to 17 individuals per . The population in Sabah is roughly estimated at 1,500‚Äì3,200 individuals, with only 275‚Äì585 of them living in totally protected reserves that are large enough to hold a long-term viable population of more than 50 individuals. Density outside protected areas in Sabah is probably much lower, estimated at one individual per . In Sumatra, it was recorded in Kerinci Seblat, Gunung Leuser and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Parks. It occurs most probably in much lower densities than on Borneo. One explanation for this lower density of about 1.29 individuals per might be that on Sumatra it is sympatric with the Sumatran tiger, whereas on Borneo it is the largest carnivore. Clouded leopard fossils were excavated on Java, where it perhaps became extinct in the Holocene.  Ecology and behaviour  The habits of the Sunda clouded leopard are largely unknown because of the animal's secretive nature. It is assumed that it is generally solitary. It hunts mainly on the ground and uses its climbing skills to hide from dangers.  Taxonomy and evolution  William Jardine's The Natural History of The Feline Felis diardi was the scientific name proposed by Georges Cuvier in 1823 in honour of Pierre-M√©dard Diard, who sent a skin and a drawing from Java to National Museum of Natural History, France. It was subordinated as a clouded leopard subspecies by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1917. Results of molecular genetic analysis of hair samples from mainland and Sunda clouded leopards showed differences in mtDNA, nuclear DNA sequences, and microsatellite and cytogenetic variation. This indicates that they diverged between 2 and 0.9 million years ago; their last common ancestor probably crossed a now submerged land bridge to reach Borneo and Sumatra. Results of a morphometric analysis of the pelages of 57 clouded leopards sampled throughout the genus' wide geographical range indicated that the two morphological groups differ primarily in the size of their cloud markings. The genus Neofelis was therefore reclassified as comprising two distinct species: * N. nebulosa in mainland Asia and * N. diardi in the Malay archipelago, except Peninsular Malaysia. Molecular, craniomandibular and dental analysis indicates distinction of the Sunda clouded leopard in two subspecies with separate evolutionary histories: * Bornean clouded leopard (N. d. borneensis) and * Sumatran clouded leopard (N. d. diardi). Both populations are estimated to have diverged during the Middle to Late Pleistocene. This split corresponds roughly with the catastrophic super-eruption of the Toba Volcano in Sumatra 69,000‚Äì77,000 years ago. A probable scenario is that Sunda clouded leopards from Borneo recolonized Sumatra during periods of low sea levels in the Pleistocene, and were later separated from their source population by rising sea levels.  Threats  Deforestation in Sumatra Sunda clouded leopards being strongly arboreal are forest-dependent, and are increasingly threatened by habitat destruction following deforestation in Indonesia as well as in Malaysia. Since the early 1970s, much of the forest cover has been cleared in southern Sumatra, in particular lowland tropical evergreen forest. Fragmentation of forest stands and agricultural encroachments have rendered wildlife particularly vulnerable to human pressure. Borneo has one of the world's highest deforestation rates. While in the mid-1980s forests still covered nearly three quarters of the island, by 2005 only 52% of Borneo was still forested. Both forests and land make way for human settlement. Illegal trade in wildlife is a widely spread practice. The population status of Sunda clouded leopards in Sumatra and Borneo has been estimated to decrease due to forest loss, forest conversion, illegal logging, encroachment, and possibly hunting. In Borneo, forest fires pose an additional threat, particularly in Kaltim and in the Sebangau National Park. There have been reports of poaching of Sunda clouded leopards in Brunei's Belait District where locals are selling their pelts at a lucrative price.Shahminan, F., Begawan, B. S. (2010). Poaching threatens clouded leopards The Brunei Times, 19 December 2010.  Conservation  Neofelis diardi is listed on CITES Appendix I, and is fully protected in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei. Sunda clouded leopards occur in most protected areas along the Sumatran mountain spine and in most protected areas on Borneo. Since November 2006, the Bornean Wild Cat and Clouded Leopard Project based in the Danum Valley Conservation Area and the Tabin Wildlife Reserve aims to study the behaviour and ecology of the five species of Bornean wild cat ‚Äî bay cat, flat-headed cat, marbled cat, leopard cat, and Sunda clouded leopard ‚Äî and their prey, with a focus on the clouded leopard; investigate the effects of habitat alteration; increase awareness of the Bornean wild cats and their conservation needs, using the clouded leopard as a flagship species; and investigate threats to the Bornean wild cats from hunting and trade in Sabah. The Sunda clouded leopard is one of the focal cats of the project Conservation of Carnivores in Sabah based in northeastern Borneo since July 2008. The project team evaluates the consequences of different forms of forest exploitation for the abundance and density of felids in three commercially used forest reserves. They intend to assess the conservation needs of these felids and develop species specific conservation action plans together with other researchers and all local stakeholders.  Names  The scientific name of the genus Neofelis is a composite of the Greek word ŒΩŒµŒø- meaning \\"new, fresh, strange\\", and the Latin word feles meaning \\"cat\\", so it literally means \\"new cat.\\" The Indonesian name for the clouded leopard rimau-dahan means \\"tree tiger\\" or \\"branch tiger\\". In Sarawak, it is known as entulu.

An Alid dynasty, they were descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah and his grandson Al-Hasan, and at least one contemporary travelerSee Nasir Khusraw's Safarnameh. describes them as having been Shi'ites of the Zaydi persuasion. Their capital was known as al-Khidhrimah, which lay near the present-day city of Al-Kharj in Saudi Arabia. History Al-Yamamah in the early Islamic period The founder of the dynasty was Muhammad ibn Yusuf al- Ukhaidhir ibn Ibrahim ibn Musa al-Djawn ibn Abd Allah al-KƒÅmil ibn Al-Hasan al-Mu'thannƒÅ bin Al-Hassan al-mujtaba bin Ali al Murtaza bin Abi Talib. Muhammad's brother Isma'il had launched a rebellion in the Tihamah in 865 against the Abbasid government and temporarily occupied the city of Mecca.Tabari, v. 35: pp. 108-9; Mas'udi, p. 395 After Isma'il's death the following year, Muhammad began stirring up trouble along the road running between the Hejaz and Iraq, but was defeated by the road's governor Abu 'l-Saj Dewdad.Madelung, \\"Banu Saj\\" Fleeing from the government forces, he made his way in al-Yamamah and established himself there in 867.Madelung, \\"Al- Ukhaydir,\\" p. 792; Mas'udi, pp. 402-3 Al-Yamamah at the time was nominally part of the Abbasid Caliphate, but the central government had largely neglected the area for years due to its remoteness. With the exception of the occasional raid by government forces,For one such incident, see Tabari, v. 34: pp. 46-51 the tribes there were largely self-governing. When Muhammad arrived in al-Yamamah, he likely gained the support of the Banu Hanifa, the largest tribe in the area, and created an independent amirate.Askar, p. 139 It is not known how much of al-Yamamah was ruled by Muhammad and his descendants. Descriptions of the extent of the amirate by medieval Muslim historians vary; one source states that it controlled only al-Khidhrimah and its outskirts, while another claims that it ruled over a territory that extended as far north as Qurran.Juhany, pp. 45-6 The early rule of the Banu 'l-Ukhaidhir was characterized by a sustained economic depression. Thousands of people are recorded as having emigrated from al-Yamamah to various provinces of the caliphate in order to escape the turmoil. Muhammad has been blamed for this period of hardship due to his oppressive rule,Askar, pp. 139-40 although it has been noted that reports of mass emigration from al-Yamamah began years before his arrival.Madelung, \\"Al-Ukhaydir,\\" p. 792 Muhammad was succeeded as amir by his son Yusuf, who was himself succeeded by his son Isma'il. Isma'il established an alliance with the powerful Qarmatians of neighboring Al-Hasa. He participated in the capture of Kufa in 925 and was given command of the town by the Qarmatian leader Abu Tahir. Relations between the two sides, however, subsequently soured, and in 928 Isma'il and several members of his family were killed in a battle with the Qarmatians. Isma'il was succeeded by his son al-Hasan, and at this point the amirate likely subordinate to the Qarmatians.Askar, p. 140 After the rule of al-Hasan's son Ahmad, the history of the Banu 'l-Ukhaidhir becomes obscure. When the traveler Nasir-i Khusraw arrived in al-Yamamah in 1051, the Banu 'l-Ukhaidhir were still ruling there, but at some point after this the Banu Kilab took over the country. Rulers * Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Ukhaidhir (from 866) * Yusuf ibn Muhammad * Isma'il ibn Yusuf (to 928) * Al-Hasan ibn Yusuf * Ahmad ibn al-Hasan * Abu 'l-Muqallid Ja'far * Descendants of Abu 'l-Muqallid Ja'far After Ahmad, the list of rulers becomes uncertain, but later amirs were descendants of his son Abu 'l-Muqallid Ja'far.

As an advocate of people's cultural movement, he drew heavily from different genres of classical and folk cultural traditions. Considered a doyen of the Culture of Assam, the Assamese people affectionately call him Kalaguru (meaning: \\"the master of the arts\\"). He is also called by Marxists as Sainik Silpi (sainik \\"soldier\\", silpi \\"artist\\") for his active participation in the armed struggle, led by the Revolutionary Communist Party of India (RCPI). Early life Statue of Kalaguru, Rupkonwar and Natasurjya at Guwahati (Side view) Bishnu Prasad Rabha was born in Dacca, Bengal Presidency, British India on 31 January 1909. His father Sardar Bahadur Gopal Chandra Rabha was born to a Bodo family, but since he was raised by Rabha family he accepted the title Rabha. Gopal Chandra Rabha was an officer in the Colonial Police Department. Bishnu Rabha attended Tezpur Government High School and later went to Calcutta for higher education. He completed his ISC exam from St. Paul's Cathedral Mission College and joined the prestigious Ripon College (now Surendranath College) at the University of Calcutta for a BSc degree. From an early stage, he played an active role in the struggle for Indian Independence. He came to be influenced by left wing ideas and came closer to the Communist Party of India. However, when Germany attacked Soviet Union during second world war and the Indian communists decided to work with the British government, a section of the party favoured a different approach ‚Äì to oppose British imperialism and Fascism simultaneously. So a split happened in the communist party and in 1945 he finally joined the Revolutionary Communist Party of India (RCPI). In 1951, after the death of Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, he became the president of the Assam branch of Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). His work Bano Kobang portrays the life worlds of various indigenous Assamese communities of Assam. His other works include Missing Coneng, Sonpahi, Axomiya Kristir Hamuh Abhakh, and Atit Axom. His interest for the upliftment and liberation of the weaker sections of society is visible in his works. Rabha was an eminent freedom fighter. His meaning of freedom however is not simply freedom from British rule. But it meant freedom from capitalism, freedom from wage-slavery, freedom from poverty and all social evils. In his own words, \\"I am fighting for a revolution from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom\\". He dedicated his entire life for this freedom movement. He donated an ancestral estate of 2500 bigha land received from the British government in favour of the peasants. His slogan was \\"Haal Jaar Maati Taar\\" means \\"those who cultivate should own the land\\". The present day Tezpur University stands upon the land donated by him. His entire life was characterised by a restlessness to work for the people and he kept on moving around like a nomad. He was also an excellent mass mobiliser. His speeches and lectures could touch the heart of the masses. However, his political struggle was never ended with individual power and seeking motive. It was only to give power at the hands of the masses. He even said that the independence achieved in 1947 was simply a farce. It is because in spite of the freedom the poor and weaker sections of the society that remained the same and Assam did not get independence from colonial India as sovereign Assam was not established. According to him, the real struggle begins after 1947. Apart from being a revolutionary he was also a brilliant Academician and Researcher. This was despite the fact that due to participation in freedom struggle he was forced by the colonial British regime to leave Ripon College at Calcutta and he transferred to Victoria College (now Acharya Brojendra Nath Seal College) at Cooch Bihar. He was not able to continue with his formal studies even there, due to frequent raid of British forces in his hostel and was compelled to give up his formal educational career for ever. Cultural influence Srimanta Sankaradeva, which was drawn by Bishnu Prasad Rabha The level of influence exerted by the Kala Guru can be observed through the fact that most cultural music competitions of Assam feature a segment called Bishnu Rava Sangeet related to his compositions, lyrics and verse. Bishnu Prasad was an established singer. He had learnt Borgeet of Shrimanta Shankar Deva and gave the genre a new significance for the modern times. There are more than hundred songs composed by him. His songs are collectively called as Bishnu Rava Sangeet. This was a new genre of Assamese. In his songs one can see diverse themes like tributes to the Mother Nature, the exploitation of the peasant masses by the colonial rulers, the revolts of the workers at tea industries etc. His songs also reflects his revolutionary ideal and the country's struggle for real freedom. Some of his songs are popular among children even today and will be, for all times to come. Some leading numbers include Xurore Deulore, Bilote Halise, etc. He advocated the need to be aware of other people's cultures, views, religions, etc., and advocated for a world community. His compositions includes song like Para jonomor khubho logonor, logon ukali gol, roi roi keteki, tilai tilai, kurua botah and many more to mention. He was a great actor. He used to perform dramas at Baan theatre of Tezpur which is regarded to be one of the oldest cultural activity centres of Assam. He also translated the famous song of revolution \\"Internationale\\" by Eug√®ne Pottier into Assamese. His paintings are still preserved in his residence at Tezpur. Theatre There have been many live performances at the Baan theatre in Tezpur which is famously connected to Bishnu Rava. This theatre (Ban Stage) where many of Bishnu Rabha's plays have been staged is designed by renowned architect Upendra Kumar Baruah Films He was also recognised as a film director, music composer (Siraj) and actor (Era Bator Sur). He was an actor par excellence. His acting expertise was witnessed by Ban Theatre of Tezpur. But, he never used this talent for commercial purpose. In spite of having very good rapport with the art world of Kolkata and Bombay, he never left Assam to achieve commercial success in the field of acting. Rather he used his talent to educate the masses. This talent also helped him to move around in disguise during his days of struggle. He also assisted in making of the first Assamese film Joymoti, by Jyoti Prasad Agarwala. He was also a recognised film director. Recognition and awards There is an award given in his honour for achievements in the cultural/music world of Assam by the state government. Kalaguru Bishnu Rabha Award 2016 Hon'ble Chief Minister of Assam, along with Ustad Amjad Ali Khan (Right), presenting the Bishnu Rabha Award 2016 to Veteran Artist Girish Chandra Borah The relevance of the ideals of Kalaguru Bishnu Prasad Rabha, the musical and artistic genius who transcended man-made barriers to unite diverse communities was remembered on the occasion of his death anniversary by Assam. The Bishnu Rabha Award for 2016 were also presented on Monday to well known artist Girish Chandra Bora and prominent Kathak exponent Bipul Das at a function organised at Rabindra Bhawan in Guwahati by the Directorate of Cultural Affairs. The award carrying Rs 100,000 each, a citation and other gifts was presented to the distinguished personalities by Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal. Acknowledging the role of the cultural brigade in nation building, Sonowal announced that in the coming days the government would come up with a special policy for the welfare of the artistes. He also assured that Rabindra Bhawan would be developed and within a few months the auditorium will provide a new experience to performers and viewers alike. Stressing the need to promote the ideals of the Kalaguru among the young generation, Sonowal said that by imbibing the humanistic values that Bishnu Prasad Rabha stood for, Assam can be propelled on the road towards real development. Sonowal also laid importance on holistic development of the youth so that they can bring the desired changes with their work culture and commitment. In his acceptance speech, Girish Chandra Bora said that the honour conferred on him will motivate him to continue with his work with greater zeal. He said that an artist never works with the intention of bagging an award or a favour but creates for the satisfaction of his heart. He also added that the literary and cultural contributions of the revolutionary Bishnu Prasad Rabha have always been an inspiration for him. On the other hand, speaking on the occasion, sarod maestro Amjad Ali Khan recalled the multifaceted personality of the Kalaguru, particularly his patriotism and cultural leanings, and said that music is an important aspect of life and it does not belong to any religion. Memorial Park Memorial inside Bishnu Rabha Smriti Udyan The Bishnu Rabha Smriti Udyan has been set up as a memorial park in his honour. It is located on the banks of the Brahmaputra near Tezpur in a plot adjacent to the Bhairabi Temple. The park is a result of the hard work of his middle son Hemraj Rabha who took the initiative to pay tribute to his father and started the construction. The project was later on taken by the government of Assam. It contains the cremation spot of the maestro. Apart from it, many of his unforgettable works are sculpted into the walls. The cremation spot lies on the bank of the Brahmaputra as a result of which it was suffering from soil erosion. But now it has been provided with embankments to prevent it and preserve it. Nowadays it has become a major site of attraction for his devotees. People often visit this place to offer homage.

He began the 1974‚Äì75 season well with 41 not out and 66 against South Australia and 62 against the touring English side. Towards the end of the 1974‚Äì75 season, he scored his maiden first class century, 150 against Victoria, then made 72 against NSW. Some journalists said he was a possibility of the 1975 Ashes but he was not picked. In 1975-76 Langer scored 111 and 64 against NSW but was outshone by Kim Hughes' century in the latter's first class debut. He made 91 and 76 against the touring West Indians. There was instability in the Australian team that summer; Langer was discussed as a test prospect but the selectors eventually went with Graham Yallop and Gary Cosier. Langer performed well during the 1976‚Äì77 season, including 55 and 76 against New South Wales, 77 against Victoria, 87 against Pakistan, 52 against Victoria, 71 vs NSW and 83 against the touring English. In January 1977 Ian Chappell picked Langer for his hypothetical squad to tour England in 1977, stating that: > Langer impresses me because he has proven himself as a consistent batsmen > over the past few years. I've always believed that it takes 3‚Äì4 years to > prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that.

World Series Cricket In October 1977 Langer signed to play with World Series Cricket for three years at a total of $75,000. Langer considered the offer for almost three weeks. Langer played two supertests during the 1977‚Äì78 season, making 45 and 8 against the West Indies and 39 and 12 against the World XI.

He also played Minor Counties cricket for Cumberland and Cornwall. An adaptable cricketer, he appeared for Cumberland and Warwickshire as a wicket-keeper, but when he moved to Somerset he developed into an aggressive batsman who bowled at medium-pace when needed. Burns started his cricket career with Cumberland in 1988, but moved to Warwickshire in late 1990. He struggled to break into the first team with his new county, and spent most of his time with the club playing in the second team. As a wicket-keeper, his opportunities were limited by the presence of Keith Piper, and he failed to make an impact as a batsman when he was given chances in the first team. He only started to play regularly for the county in 1996, but opted to move to Somerset the following year. For Somerset, Burns passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season twice, and was part of the team which won the 2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. He provided Somerset with a batting all-rounder, particularly in one-day cricket in which he averaged 27 with the bat and 30 with the ball for the county. He took over as Somerset captain in 2003, primarily due to the lack of other suitable candidates. He continued in the role in the following year, though he was criticised throughout due to poor results, which at one stage resulted in a number of Somerset's players being threatened with being sacked. He was replaced as captain in 2005 by Graeme Smith, and retired from first-class cricket at the end of that year. He subsequently trained as an umpire, and was promoted to the England and Wales Cricket Board's (ECB) reserve list in 2012. In January 2016 Burns was promoted to the full list of the ECB's umpiring list. Career=Early life and minor counties cricket Burns was born on 6 February 1969 in Barrow-in- Furness, Lancashire. He attended Walney Comprehensive in Barrow, and after completing his studies, joined the engineering firm Vickers. Burns began his county career playing Minor Counties cricket with Cumberland. He made his debut for the side in a two-day Championship match against Norfolk in July 1988. Playing as wicket-keeper, he claimed one catch and one stumping. He did not appear for the county's first team again for another year; in 1989, he played three times for Cumberland, appearing on each occasion as a specialist lower-order batsman. Early during the 1990 season, Burns played one match, without excelling, for Glamorgan's second team. He was a regular for Cumberland during 1990, and in his seven appearances in the Championship, he scored 180 runs at an average of 22.50, and took eleven catches and three stumpings. Limited opportunities at Warwickshire Burns made his first- class debut at Fenner's cricket ground in Cambridge. After initially playing club cricket for Vickerstown, Burns moved to Netherfield Cricket Club, where he played alongside Dermot Reeve, the club's professional player. Reeve was impressed by an innings in which Burns scored a half-century, and arranged for Warwickshire to offer him a trial. Burns scored 83 runs in his trial match, and signed a contract shortly thereafter. At the end of that 1990 season, Burns played a second-team match for Warwickshire; the following season he made his debut in professional cricket for the county, playing a Benson & Hedges Cup match against Essex. He batted at number eight and kept wicket in a narrow loss for Warwickshire. He spent the remainder of the season playing for the county's second team, for whom he scored a number of half-centuries, with a top score of 93, scored against Worcestershire's seconds in a one-day match. He got his first opportunities in first-class cricket near the start of the 1992 season, making his debut in the format against Cambridge University in May. During his only batting innings, he scored 78 runs, and he also claimed two catches and a stumping. He was selected to play in the County Championship match a week later against Glamorgan, but in a match dominated by the spin of Robert Croft he was dismissed for scores of three and four. He returned to play in the second team for most of the season, though he played one further first-team match in August; appearing as a specialist batsman, Burns scored one run against Durham. In a late season second team match against Lancashire seconds, Burns scored 165 runs in the first innings of a drawn match. Burns had more first team opportunities during the 1993 season, due to a series of hand injuries to the first-choice wicket-keeper, Keith Piper. Burns' chances came particularly in one-day cricket; he appeared in eleven List A matches during the year. He scored 151 runs across nine batting innings at an average of 25.16, and reached his highest score of the season, 48 not out, against the touring Zimbabweans in September. Despite making another large century for the second team, scoring 172 against Yorkshire seconds, he struggled in first- class cricket; in six appearances he averaged just 9.60 for his 96 runs. The following year, his only first-class match was against Oxford University, with Piper ever-present in the County Championship. Burns continued to be selected as a wicket-keeper batsman in one-day cricket, though he was less successful than the previous year, scoring 86 runs at 10.75. In 1995, Burns was given a prolonged run in the Warwickshire team, playing both first-class and one-day cricket throughout April and May; he failed to impress during these matches, recording a highest score of 35 and averaging well under twenty in both forms of the game. He spent the rest of the season playing for the second team. Some strong performances for the seconds at the start of the 1996 season, including scores of 77 and 81 not out in a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club Young Cricketers, and a finger injury suffered by Piper, saw him regain a place in the Warwickshire first team in June. He remained in the first team for the rest of the season, playing as a specialist batsman when Piper returned to the side, and scored three half-centuries in first-class cricket, including his highest first-class score to that point, 81 runs scored against Nottinghamshire, during a match in which he also remained 65 not out in the second innings. Move to Somerset Towards the end of the 1996 season, Warwickshire's captain Dermot Reeve was forced to retire with a chronic hip injury. He moved to Somerset in 1997, where he took on the role of team coach; Burns followed him soon after. Somerset did not have a vacancy for a wicket- keeper; in 1997, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described Robert Turner as top- class. As a result, Burns focussed on his batting, particularly in one-day cricket, and also developed as an occasional medium-pace bowler. He played significantly more cricket in 1997 than in any year previously; in first-class cricket he maintained his average from the previous year, scoring 510 runs at 25.50, and in one-day cricket he scored his maiden century in top-level cricket. Having never scored more than 48 runs in a List A match prior to 1997, Burns scored five half-centuries in addition to the 115 not out that he hit against Middlesex in September. His average of 31.35 in List A cricket that year was the highest of any season during his career, and Wisden judged that he had \\"made a good impression\\" in the season. As a bowler, Burns took almost a third of his List A wickets during 1997, claiming 18 at a bowling average of 24.77, while in the first-class game he was used more sparingly, and took 5 wickets at 53.20. During the 1998 season, Burns recorded similar batting averages to the previous season, but was rarely used as a bowler. Wisden noted that he played some good first-class innings, but needed to be more consistent; an improvement he made in 1999. That following year, Burns achieved a batting average in excess of thirty for the first time, and scored the maiden century of his first-class career. Facing Leicestershire, who had not lost in the County Championship for 21 months, Burns scored 109, and shared a 244-run partnership with Peter Bowler to help Somerset to victory by 9 wickets. His second century that season came in a defeat to Worcestershire; chasing 316 runs to win in the fourth innings, Somerset were reduced to 56 for three. Burns played an attacking innings, hitting 105 runs from 103 deliveries to give his side a chance of victory, but Worcestershire eventually won by 26 runs. Recreation Ground in Bath. His batting continued to flourish at Somerset in first-class cricket; between 1999 and 2004, he consistently averaged over 35. His highest batting average came in 2000, when he scored 775 runs at 40.78. He was boosted that season by an early-season tally of 160 against Oxford Universities, as part of a 305-run partnership with Peter Bowler for the fourth wicket. The partnership was only five runs less than Somerset's record for the fourth wicket, made in 1980 by Peter Denning and Ian Botham. His performances in the County Championship were less impressive than his overall first-class record in 2000; he averaged below thirty in the competition, and only reached a century once, against Lancashire. In 2001, Burns reached his highest first-class score, and only double-century, scoring 221 against Yorkshire at the Recreation Ground in Bath. The total, made on what Wisden described as the \\"benignest of pitches\\", included 28 fours and 1 six, and took seven and three-quarter hours. The match finished as a high- scoring draw, with over 1,000 runs being scored. Burns' score is the highest by a Somerset batsman at the Recreation Ground during a first-class match, although three players have scored more playing against Somerset at the ground; Reggie Spooner scored 240 runs in 1906, Mike Gatting got 258 in 1984 and Warwick Armstrong scored an unbeaten 303 for Australia in 1905. Burns also scored his second century in List A cricket during 2001, striking 101 not out against Northamptonshire from 112 balls. When Somerset captain Jamie Cox broke his thumb, Burns took charge of the team for six matches in June and July 2001, a role he reprised for eight matches the following season. In 2001, Somerset recorded one of the best seasons in their history: they finished second in the County Championship, their highest ever position, and won the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. In 2002, Burns scored 1,000 first-class runs for the first time in his career, though he did not score a century during the year. He passed 50 on nine occasions, and narrowly missed out on tons against both Surrey, when he was dismissed on 99 by Rikki Clarke, and Sussex, when he was caught off the bowling of Mark Davis for 98. Despite Burns' run-tally, and in stark contrast to the previous year, Somerset's season was described in Wisden as \\"a sorry story\\". No other Somerset batsman passed 1,000 runs in the year, and the county were relegated in both the County Championship and the Norwich Union League, though they did reach the final of the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy for the second consecutive year. In the semi-final of that competition, Burns scored 72 runs, and \\"admirably set the foundations\\" for Somerset's victory. Somerset captaincy Burns took over the Somerset captaincy from Australian Jamie Cox. Cox resigned the club captaincy at the end of the 2002 season, and Burns was named as his replacement; Wisden described him as a \\"dedicated, down-to-earth cricketer who hopes to lead by example from high in the order.\\" In a preview of the 2003 season for the BBC, Simon Mann wrote that Somerset had the talent to improve and he predicted that an immediate promotion back to the first division of the County Championship was \\"a strong possibility.\\" The season began in positive fashion for Burns; in a first-class match against Loughborough University he scored 83 runs in the first innings and was 118 not out in the second. He continued to score runs regularly, if not spectacularly, throughout the season, and passed 1,000 first-class runs for the second consecutive year. Ian Blackwell and Cox both reached the milestone as well for Somerset, but despite these individual achievements, the county struggled. Eight losses were suffered on the way to finishing third from bottom of the second division of the County Championship, and after one such result, a two-day loss against Northamptonshire in July, the club's chief executive sent a letter to ten members of the team warning them that they could be sacked. A few days later, against Durham, a second- innings total of 56 was the county's lowest score in a first-class match since 1970. Although Burns had a relatively successful season statistically‚Äîhis 1,133 first-class runs were the most he scored in any season of his career, and his first-class average was just under 40‚Äîhe offered to step down as Somerset captain, but when a suitable alternative could not be found, he continued in the position for 2004. The following season was another difficult one for both Burns and Somerset. Burns scored 733 first-class runs, but only passed 50 on five occasions, including a top score of 124 not out against Essex. Four wins late in the season pushed Somerset up to fourth in the second division of the County Championship, but the county were knocked out of the 2004 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy in the third round, and they finished eighth of ten in the second division of the totesport League. Their elimination from the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy came at the hands of Worcestershire; after Somerset had won the toss and Burns had chosen to bat, his side were bowled out for 95 runs, the tenth lowest List A total for the county. Burns was dismissed for a first-ball duck in the match, which Wisden reported was dominated by the \\"muscular hostility\\" of Andy Bichel, who took four wickets for Worcestershire. Both Burns and Somerset's first-team coach, Kevin Shine were criticised for the team's failures; Shine was reassigned as the county's academy director, while a committee of former captains was set up to assess the captaincy. On the recommendations of the group, composed of Roy Kerslake, Vic Marks and Brian Rose, Somerset signed the captain of the South Africa national cricket team, Graeme Smith, to lead them in 2005. Later career The signing of Smith, along with the youth policy adopted by Somerset's new first-team coach, Mark Garaway, meant that Burns had limited opportunities in 2005; he played nine first-class and eight List A matches during the season, and did not appear for the first team after July. He scored an early-season century, hitting eleven boundaries on his way to 107 runs against Warwickshire in the totesport League, but only scored 63 runs across his remaining seven one-day matches. As a result of his lack of first-team action, he opted to retire from first-class cricket at the end of the 2005 season. In all, he scored 7,648 first-class runs at an average of 32.68, and 4,802 List A runs at 25.81. He also took 68 first-class wickets and 58 in List A cricket. Burns continued to play club cricket in Somerset for Taunton St Andrews Cricket Club until 2009, helping them to become West of England Premier League champions in his final season with the club. He made minor counties appearances for Cumberland throughout 2006, before switching to Cornwall in 2008. He also toured with the Marylebone Cricket Club, travelling to Brazil and Chile in March 2007, and to Saint Kitts and Nevis in March 2008. He has subsequently stood as an umpire, and after standing in second-eleven matches in 2011, he was added to the ECB's reserve list of umpires for 2012. He made his debut as an umpire in first-class matches in March 2012, officiating in the match between Somerset and the Cardiff MCC University side.

The Gordon River Road from New Norfolk to Strathgordon passes through it. It is in the Federal electorate Division of Lyons and is in the Derwent Valley Council local government area. At the , Westerway and the surrounding area had a population of 156. History Westerway was originally known as Russell or Russelldale and was named after Surgeon J J Russell, one of the party who discovered a set of waterfalls 3 km from Fenton Forest (these are not the present day Russell Falls). The Derwent Valley Railway line reached the town in 1909. Russell Post Office opened on 1 October 1910 and was renamed Westerway in 1919. Due to confusion between the town of Russell and Russell Falls further up the road, the town's name was changed in 1919 to Westerway. It was named by, and after, W H Westerway (1851‚Äì1930), the main resident of the town who was responsible for many developments in the area. He built an accommodation house and store where Coniston siding is now, owned the Coffee Palace at Glenora and started a livery business driving tourists to Russell Falls. Westerway School opened in 1920 with thirty six students. From 1920 to 1960 there was a bakery and, from 1947 to 1970, a police station. At the time of the 1934 bushfires, the original Westerway Hall became a temporary hospital and in 1939 a recruitment office for enlistees. That hall was pulled down and rebuilt in 1940. The present hall replaced the 1940 hall after it burnt down. Westerway railway station was important as it was the starting point for the pack horse journey to the long abandoned Adamsfield osmiridium mine. As the timber industry became more important to the area, a sawmill was built and the number of timber mills in the area increased and the train line was used to transport logs to Boyer and Hobart.

It ran from 1960 to 1964 and is credited with establishing the credibility of magic as a television entertainment. History The origins of the series were in a locally broadcast show that Wilson arranged in Dallas, Texas, in 1955. That grew into other shows in Houston and San Antonio. With the introduction of videotape and the help of Alan Wakeling, Wilson created The Magic World of Allakazam as the first magic show to be videotaped and nationally syndicated. It debuted on 1 October 1960 on CBS and aired every Saturday morning on that network for two years. Wilson's wife, Nani Darnell, and their young son, Greg Wilson, assisted him and they were joined by Bev Bergeron who played the character Rebo the Clown. Other cameo appearances by Bob Towner, Robert Fenton and Chuck Burns played occasional characters on the show. The shows were in black and white and were sponsored by Kellogg's Cereals. They followed a formula that Wilson devised and which he believed was essential for the success of magic on television. This was that there should be a live audience, that there should not be a cut from one view to another during a trick and that viewers should know they were seeing exactly what the studio audience saw. Puppet stories set in the Land of Allakazam involved the King (played by Bob Towner) and his subject Perriwinkle (Chuck Barnes), opposed by the wicked magician Evilo (also Towner). In 1962, the show moved to ABC without missing a week on air. In 1965, the series left ABC and was internationally syndicated. The series was one of the top shows in the Nielsen ratings for Saturday mornings. It has been cited by a number of famous magicians as an early inspiration. Videos Wilson is currently marketing the first 24 shows on DVD in six volumes, as well as the 1970s Magic Circus episodes.

Unknown Master, Last Supper (detail); wood statues, ca. 1500-1505. The Sacred Mountain of Varallo () is a Sacro Monte (\\"sacred mountain\\", a type of mountainside Christian devotional complex) overlooking the town of Varallo Sesia in the province of Vercelli, Piedmont, northern Italy. It is the oldest Sacro Monte, founded in 1491 by Franciscan friar Bernardino Caimi. It is built on a natural terrace on the rocky slopes of Monte Tre Croci (\\"three crosses mountain\\"), on the left bank of the Sesia river where it leaves Val Mastallone. It is 600 m above sea level, 150 m above the historic centre of Varallo. Structures The Sacro Monte at Varallo comprises the minor basilica and 45 chapels, either isolated or inserted into the large monumental complexes Nazareth, Bethlehem, Pilate‚Äôs house, Calvary, Sepulchre and Parella‚Äôs house ‚Äì populated by more than 800 life size painted statues, in wood and terracotta, that dramatically illustrate the life, passion, death and resurrection of Christ. These interiors are vividly decorated with fresco paintings. The Sacro Monte area is divided into two distinct zones. The first, surrounded by plants, is set out like a sloping garden; here the chapels are positioned at strategic points along the path. Beginning with Adam and Eve or Original Sin, they narrate the story of Christ, from the Annunciation until his arrival in Bethlehem. The second zone, preceded by the Porta Aurea, is located on the summit, and is built up of palazzi and elaborate porticos, built around the two squares; piazza dei Tribunali (piazza civica) and piazza del Tempio (piazza religiosa). The aim here, was to represent the city of Jerusalem; it does indeed have a city feel about it. The chapels narrate the events of Christ's life inside and around the walls of Jerusalem; here are The Last Supper, The Burial, The Resurrection of Christ and The Assumption of the Madonna, to which the basilica is also dedicated. The urban character of this Sacro Monte clearly distinguishes it from the others. History The present layout of the Sacro Monte is the result of a series of interventions carried out from the very end of the 15th century up until the middle of the 19th century. Father Bernardino Caimi, an eminent political and religious man, was the promoter of the Sacro Monte, with the help of rich local families. He had been rector of the Palestinian Holy Places, and an Ambassador to the Spanish court. A plaque tells us that Caimi tried to recreate the ‚ÄúHoly sites, so that who could not go on a pilgrimage might see Jerusalem‚Äù. After his death in 1499, father Candido Ranzo and father Francesco da Marignano, continued his work. Helped by Gaudenzio Ferrari from Valduggia (a key figure until 1529 ‚Äì painter, sculptor and architect), creator of some of the most enthralling of the sacred dramas: The Three Kings and The Crucifixion. The Lanino brothers Giulio Cesare Luini and Fermo Stella da Caravaggio were the executors of his work. From the middle of the sixteenth- century work began on a total renovation of the site. At the height of the Counter-Reformation, all the events of Jesus‚Äôs life were to be represented, the passion and his death. The area was organized into two zones, the predominantly natural lower portion and the summit, destined to represent the City of Jerusalem. From 1570 to 1590 a substantial number of the chapels in the garden area were constructed, the frescoes were finished and the statues added. From 1593 until 1640, organization of the urbanistic, architectural and figurative elements was carried out in the elevated zone. The configuration of the Sacro Monte was taking place; the cardinal points of the first scenes - Nazareth, Bethlehem, Crucifixion and The Burial - were established in the new layout. From 1565 until 1569 the architect Galeazzo Alessi played a decisive role in the renovation work, as did the Perugian architect Domenico Alfiano, and Valsesians Giovanni d‚ÄôEnrico and Bartolomeo Ravelli. The sculptors, Tabacchetti, Giovanni D‚ÄôEnrico, and painters like il Morazzone, Tanzio, Rocca, the Gherardini brothers, and the Gianoli brothers worked in the same artistic vein established by Gaudenzio Ferrari. However, Morazzone and the d‚ÄôEnrico brothers, Giovanni and Tanzio, helped concretize the gran teatro montano. References Bibliography  * Samuel Butler, Ex Voto.

It operates on a pointer variable, and returns an \`l-value\` equivalent to the value at the pointer address. This is called \\"dereferencing\\" the pointer. For example, the C code int x; int *p; // * is used in the declaration: // p is a pointer to an integer, since (after dereferencing), // *p is an integer x = 0; // now x  0 p = &x; // & takes the address of x // now *p  0, since p  &x; and therefore *p  x *p = 1; // equivalent to x = 1, since p  &x; // now *p  1 and x  1 assigned 1 to variable \`x\` by using the dereference operator and a pointer to the variable \`x\`.  Composition  The unary * operator, as defined in C and C++, can be used in compositions in cases of multiple indirection, where multiple acts of dereferencing are required. Pointers can of course reference other pointers, and in such cases, multiple applications of the dereference operator are needed. Similarly, the Java dot operator can be used in compositions forming quite sophisticated statements that require substantial dereferencing of pointers behind the scenes during evaluation. A basic example of multiple pointer indirection is the argv argument to the main function in C (and C++), which is given in the prototype as \`char **argv\`. The name of the invoked program executable, as well as all command line arguments that followed, are stored as independent character strings. An array of pointers to \`char\` contains pointers to the first character of each of these strings, and this array of pointers is passed to the \`main\` function as the \`argv\` argument. The passed array itself \\"decays\\" to a pointer, thus \`argv\` is actually a pointer to a pointer to \`char\`, even though it stands for an array of pointers to \`char\` (similarly, the pointers in the array, while each formally pointing to a single \`char\`, actually point to what are strings of characters). The accompanying \`main\` argument, \`argc\`, provides the size of the array (i.e. the number of strings pointed to by the elements of the array), as the size of an (outmost) array is otherwise lost when it is passed to a function and converted to a pointer. Thus, \`argv\` is a pointer to the 0th element of an array of pointers to \`char\`, \`*argv\`, which in turn is a pointer to \`**argv\`, a character (precisely, the 0th character of the first argument string, which by convention is the name of the program).  Other syntax  In BCPL, an ancestor of C, the equivalent operator was represented using an exclamation mark. In C, the address of a structure (or union) \`s\` is denoted by \`&s;\`. The address of operator \`&\` is the inverse of the dereferencing operator \`*\`, so \`*&s;\` is equivalent to \`s\`. The address of a structure (or union) \`s\` may be assigned to a pointer \`p\`: p = &s; // the address of s has been assigned to p; p  &s; // *p is equivalent to s The value of a member \`a\` of a structure \`s\` is denoted by \`s.a\`. Given a pointer \`p\` to \`s\` (i.e. \`p  &s;\`), \`s.a\` is equivalently to \`(*p).a\`, and also to the shorthand \`p->a\` which is syntactic sugar for accessing members of a structure (or union) through a pointer: p = &s; // the address of s has been assigned to p; p  &s; // s.a is equivalent to (*p).a // s.a is equivalent to p->a // (*p).a is equivalent to p->a The \`->\` operator can be chained; for example, in a linked list, one may refer to \`n->next->next\` for the second following node (assuming that \`n->next\` is not null). In Unix shell scripting and in utilities such as Makefiles, the dollar sign \\"\`$\`\\" is the dereference operator, used to translate the name of a variable into its contents, and is notably absent when assigning to a variable. In various languages, prefixes are used in identifiers, known as sigils. These are not unary operators ‚Äì syntactically they are lexically part of the identifier, and have different semantics, such as indicating the data type of the identifier ‚Äì but are syntactically similar to the dereference operator and can be confused with it. For example, in a shell script \`$FOO\` is the dereference operator \`$\` applied to the variable \`FOO\`, while in Perl \`$foo\` is a scalar variable called \`foo\`. In PHP, FOO is a constant (user defined or built-in), $FOO is a variable named FOO and $$FOO is a variable, whose name is stored in variable named FOO.

Incorporated in 1992, it is located at the Northern end of Bonavista Bay just south of Cape Freels. New-Wes-Valley takes its name from the towns of Newtown, Wesleyville, and Valleyfield. The municipality was formed by the combination of eight original villages; Newtown, Templeman, Pound Cove, Wesleyville, Brookfield, Badger's Quay, Pool's Island and Valleyfield, which all adjoin each other along a 15 km stretch of coastline containing many harbours, coves and islands. The terrain of the area is barren, rocky and relatively flat in comparison with much of the province. Today, the eight villages retain much of their own identity, with the municipality still containing as many as twelve churches. The history of fishery in the area goes back to the 18th century, and it was settled by English fishermen permanently in the early to mid-19th century. Many of the early fishermen originally lived in island settlements such as Swains Island, Pinchards Island, and Flower's Island just offshore and close to the rich inshore fishing grounds, but resettled to the mainland during the 19th century, with further island resettlement occurring within the area as late as 1953. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, this area was home to famous Newfoundland sealing families including the Keans, Winsors and Barbours. Today the area still contains beautiful homes, churches and mercantile premises dating from the 19th century. The economy of the town has been mainly supported by the fish plant in Valleyfield, owned by Beothic Fisheries since the 1960s. Like many other Newfoundland fishing communities, the town has suffered from out-migration and declining population in recent years. A peak population of over 3,000 occurred during the 1950s through to the 1990s. Today, tourism is an important industry, with several heritage buildings and sites to visit, including the Barbour Living Heritage Village, at Newtown. The area was connected by highways to the rest of the province in the 1950s. Prior to that transportation was by boat, with passenger services linking to the railroad at Gambo, about 70 km away. One of the most famous living persons from Wesleyville, New-Wes-Valley is David Blackwood, an internationally known Canadian artist whose work is inspired by his childhood memories of the area.

The paper was started with a $500 investment by Cowan, who was a silent partner in the paper until 1977 when the Braithwaites became the only owners.

He is best known as a founding member of Scottish indie rock band Idlewild, with whom he has co-written and recorded six studio albums. Jones has released two solo albums and also currently fronts rock band The Birthday Suit. He is also a co-creator of the ongoing musical project, The Fruit Tree Foundation. Early life Jones was born in Durban, South Africa and grew up in London and Leeds, England. His parents are classical musicians, English soprano Alison Jack and Welsh conductor John Pryce-Jones. Jones began playing music at four years of age and initially resisted the musical influence of his parents. Jones' first job was working as a kitchen porter at a Harry Ramsden's restaurant. The first piece of recorded music he purchased was the \\"Do they know it's Christmas?\\" single, by the Band Aid project. Musical career=Idlewild Idlewild formed in Edinburgh, with the original line-up consisting of Jones, Roddy Woomble, Phil Scanlon and Colin Newton. Jones first met Newton and Woomble at an Edinburgh university, and the band proceeded to release seven albums and three compilations‚Äîtwo albums debuted in the UK \\"Top 10\\" chart, while twelve of Idlewild's singles ranked in the UK \\"Top 40\\" chart. Together with the band, Jones toured extensively, both in the UK and internationally, in headline and supporting roles; Idlewild toured with popular bands such as REM, U2, the Rolling Stones, Pearl Jam and Coldplay. Following Idlewild's commitments for the band's seventh album, Post Electric Blues (released in October 2009), an \\"indefinite hiatus\\" was announced. Solo Jones released his debut solo album, A Sentimental Education, in 2009. In a 2010 interview with The List website, Jones briefly explained the history of his inaugural solo effort: \\"This album only started out as a hobby initially,‚Äô he says. ‚ÄòI recorded the songs on my own and worked on them for about a year, until it got to the point that I thought what I was doing was actually OK.\\" Music journalist, Chris Buckle, writing for the UK \\"independent cultural\\" media outlet, The Skinny, awarded the album two \\"stars\\" out of a possible total of five, stating that \\"his [Jones] voice is passable but leaves little impression, which wouldn't be a problem if the songs imposed themselves more strongly.\\" Jones released his second solo album, A Generation Innocence, in August 2012; however, while writing for the second album, Jones encountered a hurdle at the halfway mark, as he discovered that he was not satisfied with any of the material that he had written thus far. In 2011, Jones explained, \\"I was a bit fed up with the whole folk music thing ‚Äì I mean every man and his dog was doing the faux folk thing\\"‚ÄîJones then proceeded to learn the drums and eventually formed the band, The Birthday Suit, to record the material that he had created in the period following the drumming diversion. The Fruit Tree Foundation In 2010, Jones founded The Fruit Tree Foundation \\"mental health arts group\\", alongside former Delgados guitarist and vocalist, Emma Pollock, and musician, Jill O'Sullivan, in order to raise awareness of mental health issues. In an article promoting Jones' participation in the Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival (SMHAFF), the musician revealed that he had previously suffered depression and explained the importance of music as a support mechanism: \\"It is such a universal art form. A positive force. It can really change your mood, both watching and playing ... There‚Äôs such a loneliness and stigma associated with mental illness but music can really bring people together.\\" Jones was a member of a music initiative, entitled \\"Music Like A Vitamin\\", that has appeared twice at the SMHAFF. As of October 2012, Jones was running community-based music therapy workshops in Edinburgh, Scotland. The Birthday Suit In late 2011, Jones formed The Birthday Suit and described the band as \\"essentially a solo project ... It‚Äôs an ever-changing bistro of musicians.\\" The band released its debut album, The Eleventh Hour, in October 2011. Writing for the PopMatters website, David Bloom, critiqued the album in the following manner (Bloom rated the album \\"6\\" out of a possible 10): > ... The Eleventh Hour plows along with a familiar intensity and melodic > flavor, which should please most Idlewild fans, but also makes it suffer by > comparison. Jones‚Äô known strengths as a writer and guitarist work against > him as a lead vocalist, as his limitations are put into sharpest relief > against those songs that most resemble his work with Idlewild; it‚Äôs hard to > not hear Woomble‚Äôs iconic delivery doing them greater justice. The Birthday Suit's second studio album, A Conversation Well Rehearsed was released on 3 December 2012. The album was listed in 19th place in the Clean Slate Music website's \\"Top 21 Albums of 2012\\" list, although the website write that the second album \\"doesn't carry the punch\\" of the band's debut album. Collaborations In 2000, Jones played second guitar for Graham Coxon on a UK solo tour that occurred in 2000. Jones collaborated with Woomble on his solo album, My Secret is My Silence, released in 2006. In 2006, Jones recorded a self-titled album with singer, Inara George, called George is Jones. The album was due for release in the autumn of 2006; however, the project has not been revived after a period of hiatus and has yet to be released. Jones notes that a release of the album is \\"doubtful\\", a situation that is due to \\"too many problems surrounding it.\\" Personal life Jones is married and the song, \\"Me and Mrs Jones\\", by Billy Paul, was played at his wedding.

Station  The iconic watertower of Gobabeb The Station is located 120 km south-east of Walvis Bay in Namibia's largest nature reserve Namib Naukluft Park. Gobabeb lies at the meeting point of three different ecosystems: the ephemeral Kuiseb River, the Sand Dunes Sea to the south and the gravel plains to the north. This offers an excellent diversity of environments in which to conduct research.  Climate  As the station is located in the Namib desert, the climate is hyperarid with an average annual precipitation of 23.8 mm, about 65% during the summer months (December to May). In 2010/2011 an extreme rainfall of about 165 millimetres was measured during rainy season. With each average monthly temperature above 18 ¬∞C, in K√∂ppen climate classification, the climate is considered as tropical. With an average annual temperature of 21.4 ¬∞C, the climate is nearly 6 ¬∞C warmer than the temperate coast (15.5 ¬∞C at Walvis Bay) though at about 400 m above sea level : given that Gobabeb is at about 60 km from the coast it is much less under the influence of the cold coastal ocean Benguela current than coastal areas such as Walvis Bay. A cold coastal ocean current cools the above oceanic air. The latter being cooled, water vapour in that air may become liquid water. Therefore, clouds and particularly fogs may appear, hugely diminishing insolation and thus temperature. Thus cold ocean currents along western coast of continents doubly cool these coasts : by their own cold and by the nebulosity (due to clouds including fogs and mists) they bring. For instance Walvis Bay has 140 days of fog per year while Gobabeb has \\"only\\" 94 days.http://www.raison.com.na/Pages%2020%20to%2045.pdf page 27 Gobabeb's remoteness from the Atlantic explains why it is significantly warmer than the Namibian coast (Walvis Bay average temperature is only 15.4 ¬∞C) despite being at a greater altitude. The Station consists of the Community Research ‚Äì Center, a library, laboratories, an office block, a meeting hall, the iconic water tower, staff houses and accommodations for visitors.  History  Dr. Charles Koch, Gobabeb's first director (at right), on a field trip in the gravel plains The plaque on the wall pays tribute to Dr. Charles Koch Gobabeb was formerly a Topnaar community called !Nomabeb, which means place of the figtree. In 1958 the Austrian entomologist Dr. Charles Koch did an expedition in the Namib Desert, focused on the large diversity of beetles found in the area. One year later the South African Transvaal Museum decided to found a research station in, what was at the time known as, South West Africa (today called Namibia). In 1962 the Namib Desert Research Station (NDSR) was founded, with Dr. Charles Koch appointed as the first director of the station. The government of South Africa, which controlled South West Africa, supported Gobabeb by giving the ground on leasehold for 50 years and financial support of R2,000 per year. In 1963 the construction of the staff houses, laboratory, office block, garages and a small water tower was completed. In 1965 a partnership between Gobabeb and the South African Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) led to the foundation of the Desert Ecological Research Unit (DERU). The partnership provided R25,000 for the station which was invested in additional buildings. Five years later, in 1970, the director Dr. Charles Koch died and the biologist Dr. Mary Seely took over the directorship. In 1983, the first Open Weekend was held at Gobabeb, beginning a tradition that continues to this day. In 1989 the first course for Namibian university students in Ecology Methods was held at Gobabeb. With the Independence of Namibia in 1990 the DERU became the Desert Research Foundation of Namibia (DRFN). The main seat of the DRFN moved to Windhoek, but the research station remained in Gobabeb. In March 1998 Gobabeb Training and Research Center (GTRC) was founded as a joint venture agreement between the DRFN and the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET). Additionally, the German Ministerium f√ºr wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development) has been a great supporter of GTRC. Since the formation of the joint venture, Gobabeb has operated as a research, training and education centre. Researchers from all over the world study subjects including desertification, water procurement, and the adaption of animals and plants to the desert environment. In 2002, after 32 years directorship at Gobabeb, Dr. Mary Seely passed the position on to Dr. Joh Henschel. The new director arranged the building of several new accommodations for visitors as well as the building of the Community Resource ‚Äì Center at Gobabeb. From 2002 to 2004 Gobabeb's energy system was overhauled as a part of the Demonstration Project at Gobabeb of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (DeGREEE). In May 2005 Prime Minister Angula officially inaugurated the Gobabeb Training and Research Center. In March 2011 Joh Henschel resigned his position as director, ushering in a period of transition at Gobabeb lasting from March to August 2011, when the station's affairs were handled by a management committee and an overseer. In January 2013 Gillian Maggs-K√∂lling was appointed Executive Director of GTRC. In 2017, the name of the station was changed to Gobabeb Namib Research Institute, to reflect Maggs-K√∂lling's emphasis on restoring research as Gobabeb's primary mission. Research The overall goal of research at Gobabeb is to improve the understanding of arid land ecosystems, particularly their variability, with a focus on supporting well-trained specialists and decision-makers in southern Africa and the world. Gobabeb has been the locus of much of the basic research on Namib desert organisms and, more broadly, into the ecology of southern African deserts and arid land. Every year over 100 scientists visit Gobabeb to undertake research and in the past 50 years, over 1900 publications has been produced at Gobabeb. As a result of such research, the worldwide knowledge about animals and plants coping with the extreme conditions of the desert has vastly improved. One of Gobabebs greatest discoveries: The beetle Onymacris unguicularis The fields of research at Gobabeb include: *Desert organisms and their biodiversity *Arid land ecosystems and geo-processes *Preventing desertification *Climate and climate change *Restoration ecology of degraded lands *Appropriate technology *Alternative livelihoods within the limits of arid environments The results of this research contribute to many other projects. In particular, long term ecological monitoring of climate and biodiversity, which in some cases has been collected continuously for almost 50 years, represents a valuable contribution to global scientific knowledge. Additionally, research results from Gobabeb support the Kuiseb Basin Management Committee to undertake its integrated land and water management program. In 2010, the Namib Ecological Restoration and Monitoring Unit (NERMU) was established at Gobabeb to address the issue of expanding uranium mining and prospecting within the Namib desert. To date, NERMU has researched or is researching the impact of mining and prospecting on the Hartmann's Mountain Zebra, the Husab Sand Lizard, hypolithic cyanobacteria and other organisms.  Training  Training is a primary function of the Gobabeb Namib Research Institute. Over 1.000 learners come to Gobabeb each year, receiving training in various fields. Most of the participants are students from primary, secondary and tertiary school. However, farmers, private persons, community representatives and interested groups are also trained. The training is broad-based and concentrates on using participatory methods and hands-on approaches. The Programs are provided by Gobabeb staff, visiting trainers and local, regional and international expert. Training is offered in the fields of community based natural resource management, arid land management, desertification, ecology and appropriate technology. In addition to short training courses, Gobabeb has offered long- term tertiary training to over 180 students at the centre. The Summer Desertification Programme (SDP) ran from 1993 to 2005. Participants were presented with a real-life research problem concerning land degradation, and involving bio-physical and socio-economic factors. Following the end of funding of SDP, the Gobabeb In-Service Training Programme (GIST)began in 2005 as a partnership between the Polytechnic of Namibia and Gobabeb. GIST research projects included one term of study (approximately 3-month) and covered a wide variety of topics related to the ecology of the Namib Desert. In 2009, the GIST Program transformed into the Gobabeb Training and Research Internship Program (GTRIP), opening the course to all Namibian university students and recent graduates. Since 2010, research in the GTRIP course has focused on restoration ecology in the Namib Desert, contributing to the goals of NERMU. Gobabeb hosts also national and international interns and volunteers.  Appropriate technology  The Gobabeb Namib Research Institute has been built as an example of appropriate technology, which shows how appropriate technology and sustainable development can be used in daily life. It demonstrates techniques that are applicable at community and commercial/industrial levels. A part of the \\"Demonstration Project at Gobabeb of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency\\" (DeGREEE) Project: The solar panels Following systems at Gobabeb are installed under the heading of Appropriate Technology: *A solar-diesel hybrid energy system, consisting of 370 solar panels, 60 lead acid batteries and two diesel generators. Through this system, more than 90% of all energy used at Gobabeb, mainly for electricity and water heating, is provided by the sun. *A water recycling system. All sewage water from the station goes into a trickling filter system and gets used again. *Fog harvesting. With the help of different kinds of nets, fog water is harvested at Gobabeb. One net can gather up to 3.3 litres of water per square meter on a foggy night. This method might have practical application in the Topnaar settlements along the Kuiseb River. *Appropriate buildings. New buildings are made of clay bricks which are made from silt of the Kuiseb River. The thick walls of these bricks are thermally ideal for the desert, being warm in winter and cool in summer. *Waste management. All organic waste is fed to goats belonging to the Topnaar community. Recyclable waste like glass, metals, plastics and paper are taken to Walvis Bay where they are handed to recycling agencies linked to the Walvis Bay Municipality. *Solar cooking. Gobabeb uses two different kind of solar cookers, box cookers and a parabolic cooker, all of which do not require any electricity. Library The Gobabeb Centre Library The Gobabeb Centre Library is built for researchers, students and staff, working in and around Gobabeb, as well being open to interested visitors. The library provides access to information and works done in and around Gobabeb and in the Namib Desert. The Library started in 1963 with its first in-house publications Scientific Papers of the Namib Desert Research Station by Gobabeb's first Director Dr. Charles Koch. Since then the library has grown to house the most extensive collection on arid zone research in ecology and biology in sub-Saharan Africa. It is certainly the leading information centre on the Namib Desert and also includes information on deserts of the world. This information is stored in books (1780), journal offprint publications (18790) and in 30 journal holdings. To offer easier access to library for our users, Gobabeb is in the process of digitising information stored in the library. With the help of D-LIB it soon will be possible to get information from the Gobabeb Centre Library via Internet.

POGL provides support for most OpenGL 2.0 extensions, abstracts operating system specific proc handlers, and supports OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT), a simple cross-platform windowing interface. POGL provides additional Perl-friendly application programming interfaces (API) for passing and returning strings and arrays. The primary maintainer of Perl OpenGL is Chris Marshall.Chris Marshall As of July 3, 2011, the Perl OpenGL Project on SourceForge.net was started and all development and module support going forward has moved there.  Platform support  * Microsoft Windows: NT-XP-Vista-7 * OS X: version Mac OS X v10.x only * Linux: Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo * FreeBSD * Solaris Confirmed with: * nVidia (Quadro-110M,6600,6800,7300,7800,7950,8800) * ATI (Radeon 9000/9200, FireGL) * Cygwin/X Window System (Mesa)  Interoperability = Perl Data Language  POGL is used as the OpenGL binding for the 3D graphics in the Perl Data Language (PDL).  ImageMagick: image loading, modifying, saving  The POGL team has collaborated with the ImageMagick team to add PerlMagick APIs that allow GPUs and ImageMagick to share cache buffers via C pointers - optimizing performance for FBOs and VBOs - for use with loading and saving textures and GPGPU data transfer. These APIs have been added to ImageMagick 6.3.5: * Get('Scene') - returns the number of scenes in an IM image. * Get('Quantum') - returns IM's cache depth. * GetImagePixels() - returns a C pointer to IM's image cache. * SyncImagePixels() - sync's IM's image cache after a write (for large/paged images).  FFmpeg: video frame textures  CPAN's FFmpeg module may be used with POGL and the above File::Magick APIs to map video to OpenGL textures.  Performance = Perl vs C  General Purpose graphics processing unit (GPU, GPGPU) processing is one area in which Perl can be compared with compiled languages in performance. Based on their own benchmarks, Perl OpenGL developers claim that there are no significant performance differences between C and Perl (via POGL), when rendering a realtime 3D animated object with dynamically generated texturemaps. They analyze their results by remarking that GPGPU vertex shaders can execute complex C-like code on large arrays of data, rarely touching the CPU.  Perl vs Python  Perl OpenGL developers claim that POGL performs over 20% faster than Python.  OpenGL objects  POGL provides specialized objects that enhance Perl performance. POGL objects store data as typed C arrays, and pass data between APIs using C pointers - eliminating the need to copy/convert/cast when passing data between interfaces.  OpenGL::Array (OGA)  OGAs store OpenGL data as typed C arrays. OGAs may be populated by C pointer, Perl packed arrays (strings) or Perl arrays. OGAs may be bound/mapped to VBOs to share data between the GPU and Perl. Accessor methods provide a means to get/set array elements by C pointer, packed arrays or Perl arrays.  OpenGL::Image (OGI)  POGL is a compiled module, and may be used in conjunction with compiled imaging modules (such as ImageMagick) for loading/saving data arrays (textures). OGIs use OGAs to wrap image buffers from various imaging libraries. OGI simplifies loading/modifying/saving OpenGL textures, FBOs and VBOs. OGI provides an extensible plug-in architecture to support new imaging libraries: OGI supports ImageMagick (v6.3.5 or newer), and by default Targa (uncompressed RGBA files). OGI provides direct C pointer access to ImageMagick's image cache, resulting in performance improvement in transferring images/data between the GPU and IM.  OpenGL::Shader (OGS)  The OSG module abstracts OpenGL APIs for ARB (assembly), Cg and GLSL shading languages. \` $shdr = new OpenGL::Shader(); my $ext = lc($shdr->GetType()); my $stat = $shdr->LoadFiles(\\"fragment.$ext\\",\\"vertex.$ext\\"); $shdr->Enable(); $Shader->SetVector('surfacecolor',1.0,0.5,0.0,1.0); $Shader->SetMatrix('xform',$xform); # Draw here $shdr->Disable(); \`  Sample renderings  File:Pogl blacklight.jpgSnap shot of a realtime animated blacklight shader.  Status  The latest CPAN release of the following POGL modules are * OpenGL v0.66 * OpenGL-Image v1.03 * OpenGL-Shader v1.01 POGL provides access to most of the OpenGL APIs up to 1.2, and OpenGL extensions, such as Framebuffer Objects (FBO) and Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO).

Serge Doubrovsky coined the term in 1977 with reference to his novel Fils. Philippe Vilain distinguishes autofiction from autobiographical novels in that autofiction requires a first-person narrative by a protagonist who has the same name as the author. Autofiction combines two mutually inconsistent narrative forms, namely autobiography and fiction. An author may decide to recount his/her life in the third person, to modify significant details or 'characters', using fiction in the service of a search for self. It has parallels with faction, a genre devised by Truman Capote to describe his novel In Cold Blood. Autofiction is principally a genre associated with contemporary French authors, among them Vassilis Alexakis, Christine Angot, Emmanuel Carr√®re, Marguerite Duras, Guillaume Dustan, Annie Ernaux, Alice Ferney, Herv√© Guibert, √âdouard Louis, Am√©lie Nothomb, Olivia Rosenthal, and Anne Wiazemsky. Catherine Millet's 2002 memoir The Sexual Life of Catherine M. famously used autofiction to explore the author's sexual experiences.

Besides Rowland Hill and James Chalmers, he is said to be the inventor of the postage stamp. Idea of adhesive tax postmarks In 1835, five years before the introduction of the worldwide first stamps in Great Britain, he suggested the introduction of adhesive tax postmarks (aufklebbare Brieftaxstempel) to the Department of Commerce in Vienna, which was responsible for the postal system. These postmarks were to be used for the pre-payment of postage. He called them gepresste Papieroblate (pressed paper wafers), which are known today as stamps. His suggestion was looked at in detail, but rejected for the time being. Lovrenc Ko≈°ir conceived that the stamps would be modelled on the official sealing stamps that were already used in Austria. However, because he had contact with England, it is presumed that he got the idea from James Chalmers, who had already made stamp designs one year earlier than Ko≈°ir. However, Chalmers did not submit his designs until three years after Lovrenc Ko≈°ir's suggestion. Ko≈°ir was immortalised on several commemorative stamps in Austria, Slovenia and Yugoslavia. Both Austria and Yugoslavia very much supported Lovrenc Ko≈°ir being recognised as the one and only inventor of the postage stamp. On 21 August 1948, a commemorative stamp set was issued, which consisted of four stamps and showed his portrait. In the same year, the Yugoslav postal system issued an airmail stamp depicting Lovrenc Ko≈°ir, his birth house in Spodnja Lu≈°a, and an aeroplane. What is special about these stamps is the allonge attached to each stamp. It has an inscription in Serbo- Croatian and in French giving information about Lovrenc Ko≈°ir's contribution regarding the invention of stamps. On the centenary of his death 1979, Ko≈°ir was depicted on an Austrian commemorative stamp (as Laurenz Koschier), with the inscription \\"pioneer of the postage stamp.\\" In 2004, the Slovenian Post issued a commemorative stamp celebrating Ko≈°ir's 200 years of birth.

She saw service during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. After her U.S. Navy career, she was in commission in the United States Revenue Cutter Service from 1907 to 1915 as the revenue cutter USRC Itasca, and in the Revenue Cutter Service‚Ä≤s successor service, the United States Coast Guard, as the cutter USCGC Itasca from 1915 to 1922. During her Coast Guard career, she saw service during World War I. Construction and commissioning Bancroft was laid down in 1891 at Elizabethport, New Jersey, by Samuel L. Moore & Sons Shipyard and launched on 30 April 1892. She was commissioned on 3 March 1893 at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, with Miss Mary Frances Moore as sponsor. U.S. Navy history=Naval Academy training ship Bancroft was designated as a training ship for the United States Naval Academy midshipmen and stationed at Annapolis, Maryland. Similar in shape to a small gunboat, the ship had a steel hull and a relatively heavy armament, ranging from 4-inch rapid-fire guns to a Gatling gun and a torpedo tube, to give midshipmen experience on the Navy's latest weaponry. Between 1893 and 1896, she cruised along the United States East Coast, visiting various shipyards with groups of midshipmen embarked. Naval expansion brought a corresponding increase on the Naval Academy's enrollment, and Bancroft quickly proved to be too small. After the practice cruise of 1896, she was converted into a conventional gunboat with a reduced armament and the original three-masted barkentine rig cut down to the two masts of a brigantine. Patrol On 15 September 1896, Bancroft sailed to join the European Squadron and for the next 15 months protected American interests in the eastern Mediterranean. Called home as relations between the United States and Spain deteriorated early in 1898, Bancroft reached Boston, Massachusetts, on 4 April 1898. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began on 25 April 1898 when the United States Congress declared war on Spain, retroactive to 21 April, and Bancroft served with the North Atlantic Squadron from 9 May to 9 August 1898. She convoyed troop transports to Cuba and was on blockade duty at Havana and the Isle of Pines. On 28 July 1898, Bancroft seized the small Spanish schooner Ensenada de Cortez but returned the boat to her owner the next day because it was essentially valueless. The war ended on 13 August 1898, and Bancroft returned to Boston on 2 September 1898 and was decommissioned on 30 September 1898. Recommissioned on 6 October 1902, Bancroft served until 1905 as a station ship at San Juan, Puerto Rico, cruising in the West Indies. She operated along the coast of Panama in 1903 during the separation of Panama from Colombia. During 1904 she returned to patrol duties in the West Indies. On 29 January 1905 she departed San Juan and steamed to the New York Navy Yard, where she spent a month. On 24 February 1905 she arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, where she subsequently was decommissioned on 2 March 1905. Bancroft was transferred to the United States Revenue Cutter Service on 30 June 1906. U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and Coast Guard history=Revenue Cutter Service The Revenue Cutter Service renamed the ship USRC Itasca. Itasca was refitted as a training vessel for the Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction at Curtis Bay in Baltimore, Maryland. The Revenue Cutter Service commissioned her as a revenue cutter on 17 July 1907 and used her for summer training cruises for the School of Instruction Corps of Cadets. Initially home-ported at Curtis Bay, she made her first summer training cruise to Europe and the Mediterranean in 1907, also visiting Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.King, p 176 In 1909 the summer cruise included ports-of-call in Spain and Italy.King, p 179 In 1910, the United States Department of War vacated Fort Trumbull near the mouth of the Thames River on Long Island Sound in New London, Connecticut, and it became the new home of the Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction. Itasca‚Ä≤s crew and embarked students placed as much of the school‚Ä≤s property as could be brought on board Itasca at Curtis Bay for transportation to the new School of Instruction location in New London.Johnson, p 15King, pp 179-180 When she was not being used as a training ship, Itasca was assigned relief duties for other revenue cutters on the U.S. East Coast requiring yard availability for repairs.King, p 183 After World War I broke out in Europe in late July 1914, cruises to Europe were suspended and the usual training cruises were interspersed with cruises that enforced the Neutrality Act of 1794 in seaports along the U.S. East Coast and in Puerto Rico.Johnson, pp 42-43 Coast Guard By Act of Congress on 28 January 1915 the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service merged with the United States Life-Saving Service to form the United States Coast Guard. After 28 January 1915 all cutter names prefixed with \\"USRC\\" were changed to \\"USCGC;\\" thus, USRC Itasca became USCGC Itasca.When was the Coast Guard established? Coast Guard Historian's Office FAQ http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/when.asp On 6 April 1917, the day the United States entered World War I when the U.S. Congress declared war on Germany, Itasca was in the harbor at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and prevented the interned Imperial German Navy tender KD-III from being scuttled by her crew. Heroic efforts by Itasca‚Ä≤s engineer division managed to block the sabotaged sea valves in KD-III‚Ä≤s engine room even though the valves were under several feet of seawater. After the flooding finally was brought under control, there was of water in the after hold and in the forward hold. United States Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels commended the Itasca salvage team and gave the leader of the team, First Lieutenant (Eng.) Carl M. Green a special letter of commendation.Larzelere, pp 187-190 With the declaration of war, Itasca was reassigned to the Fourth Naval District headquartered at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was refitted for anti- submarine service with the addition of 3-inch rapid-fire guns and a Y-gun for launching depth charges. Based at Cold Spring, New Jersey, she was assigned patrol duties from the southern New Jersey coast to the entrance of Delaware Bay.Larzelere, p 87 After the armistice of 11 November 1918 brought World War I to an end, Itasca returned to the United States Coast Guard Academy ‚Äì as the Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction had been renamed after the 1915 creation of the Coast Guard ‚Äì at New London as a training vessel, but a shortage of personnel prevented her from being manned. Her last training cruise was completed during the summer of 1920, arriving in New London on 3 October 1920. The Coast Guard acquired a replacement training vessel, the former barkentine-rigged gunboat , from the U.S. Navy on 1 July 1921 and renamed her USCGC Alexander Hamilton on 18 August 1922.Canney, p 80Johnson, p 64 Itasca was decommissioned and sold in Baltimore, Maryland, on 11 May 1922 for US$8,250.00 to Mr. Charles A.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The cartoon was released on November 20, 1943, and stars Daffy Duck.  Plot  Early one morning, somewhere in World War II-era Germany, Commander Von Vultur is tempestuously pacing back and forth inside his bunker while fuming and spluttering furiously about how so many American commandos have managed to slip behind German enemy lines undetected and how it would happen if he had sent more troops to guard the country's boundary, while a snippet from Wagner's Das Rheingold plays on the soundtrack. He gets a telegram from the \\"Gestinko Gestapo\\", threatening him with his ‚Äòka-rear‚Äô if he lets ‚Äòvun‚Äô more ‚Äòkommando‚Äô through (the letter is signed \\"The Apes Of Wrath\\" and shows three apes' heads; the apes are caricatures of Hitler, Hirohito and Mussolini, the last of whom is crossed out - reflecting the fact of Italy being knocked out of the war by then). The settings recalls World War I trenches more than any actual scene of World War II. Hearing an American warplane overhead, he calls in his batman ‚Äì Schultz ‚Äì whom he abuses by knocking him regularly over his helmet with a mallet. They run outside and use a searchlight to search for any more landing commandos and eventually spot one, who just happens to be Daffy floating down on a parachute, whilst singing Billy Bennett's \\"She Was Poor But She Was Honest\\" in a fake Cockney accent. After a quick shout of \\"Put out those lights!\\" gets the searchlight turned off temporarily and allows him to land unseen, Daffy uses his fingers on the searchlight's lens to make shadows of animated puppets and dancing chorus girls on the clouds to distract the Germans before hiding behind a curtain that says \\"asbestos\\". When Von Vultur opens the curtain, Daffy makes an ugly face similar to the stereotypical Japanese faces used in cartoons at the time (see, for example, Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips), causing Von Vultur to run off frightened. Back at Von Vultur's bunker, Daffy tricks him into telling him the time (6:45 and one quarter) and presents him with a ticking time bomb \\"as a little token of our esteem\\". Just realizing its imminent danger, Von Vultur hands the bomb off to Schultz, who is literally blown through the roof. When Schultz falls back, Daffy (who was hiding underneath Schultz's helmet) stops Von Vultur from hitting Schultz over the head with a mallet, and instead hits him. Von Vultur (pausing briefly to salute a skunk with \\"Heil Hitler!\\") chases Daffy to a telephone booth, where Daffy continues to make fun of him, such as nicknaming him \\"Von Limburger\\" (after the infamously foul-smelling cheese). The much abused Schultz character, an underling in the German Army who always gets the blame when things go wrong, is probably based on a similar character in the popular 1942 Jack Benny film \\"To Be or Not to Be\\". Daffy then jumps in a plane, narrowly avoiding being shot by \\"a whole mess of Messerschmitts\\". When Daffy is shot down by Von Vultur, his plane is literally blown to pieces (its entire body progressively disintegrating and disappearing from back to front, eventually leaving just the engine and propeller), with Daffy still clinging to the controls. Daffy then runs into what he believes is a tunnel where he can hide, but it turns out to be the barrel of a huge howitzer cannon, and he's then shot out by Von Vultur (\\"Now try and duck this one, you duck!\\"). However, Daffy flies unharmed (as a ‚Äòhuman cannonball‚Äô) into Berlin, where (a largely rotoscoped) Adolf Hitler is making one of his infamous emotionally-inflamed furiously-ranting public speeches (although his speech is humorously nonsensical as it goes as follows: \\"Haben sie nicht liebe?! (mock German) Ach, du lieber! Mein herr! Mein Pupkin! Mein milch! Mein Heineken!\\"). Daffy jumps up and whacks Hitler on the head with a mallet, causing Hitler to yell for Schultz, similar to Von Vultur.  Telephone booth scene  A scene where Daffy is on a pay phone as Von Vultur is trying to get into the booth has Daffy speaking to him in semi-correct German, while holding cue card-like signs with the dialogue translated for the audience (a classic example of \\"breaking the fourth wall\\"). In many public domain prints, the signs are illegible, but read as follows: Daffy 1: \\"Kannst du nicht sehen, diese Telefon ist busy? Bleiben Sie ruhig!\\" (\\"Can you not see this telephone is busy? Stay calm!\\") Sign 1: ENGLISH TRANSLATION: \\"Can't you see this telephone is busy? Wait your turn!\\" Daffy 2: \\"Bitte, mein Herr, haben Sie ein F√ºnf-Pfennig-St√ºck?\\" (\\"Please, sir, have you a five pfennig coin?\\") \\"Danke sch√∂n.\\" (\\"Thank you very much.\\") Sign 2: \\"Got a nickel, bud?\\" Daffy 3: \\"It's all yours, Von Limburger!\\" Sign 3: GERMAN TRANSLATION: \\"Ich bin fertig mit der Telefon, Herr Von Limburger.\\" (\\"I'm done with the telephone, Mr. Von Limburger.\\") When Von Vultur enters the phone booth, he attempts to contact Schultz, but instead gets an operator, replying: \\"Ist dat you, Myrt?\\" This is a reference to the American radio comedy series Fibber McGee and Molly, which was popular at the time. Myrtle was the never-heard switchboard operator in the show (\\"Is that you, Myrt?\\" was a popular catchphrase in it that referred to her).  Poster in the background A still from the short where Schultz is in his helmet, e a poster of a woman with stars on her nipples and only wearing underwear is visible. The poster is also visible when Schultz is kicking Von.

A European ambiance of chic cafes, boutiques, and restaurants along the street propelled Bandung to attain the Dutch nickname Parijs van Java (\\"Paris of Java\\"). Braga Street begins on a T-junction with Asia-Afrika Street (formerly De Groote Postweg), running north until the city council (balaikota). Early history The first grocery store in the city, De Vries, opposite Braga Street. The first name of the street was Karreweg. The city residents dubbed it Pedatiweg, from the Indonesian language of horse- drawn carriages (pedati), because it was a narrow street (about 10 m or 30 feet wide) that only carriages could pass through. The street was built only to connect the major Great Post Road with a coffee warehouse, owned by a Dutch coffee plantation owner Andries de Wilde (the warehouse is now the seat of the city administration or balaikota). In 1856, when Bandung was the capital of Priangan Regency, some colonial houses were built along the dirt road of Braga Street with their houses thatched with reeds, alang-alang grass or other straw materials. The Toneel Braga musical drama group In 1882, a theater group established itself at the south part of the street and the Toneel Braga, the name of the drama group, became famous. Residents flocked into the street to watch the group's performance every night and therefore the road was improved by stone pavements, and oil lamps were installed. The street was at that time popularly known as the Braga street. In 1884, a railroad connecting Batavia to Bandoeng was laid down and the city core grew rapidly. New buildings filled the southern end of the street while the northern end was still a rubber tree forest. The street became more famous with a grocery store named De Vries which sold daily needs for plantation owners. Hotels, banks, cafes and restaurants were opened and the street transformed into a major shopping street. In the early twentieth century, the street was the most important European shopping street in the Dutch Indies. Several well-known Western companies opened their stores in the street, including Chrysler, Plymouth and Renault car distributors. Colonial bookstores, watches and jewellery retailers and boutique shops were common in the street for the high society. Buildings Aerial view of Braga Street in 1947 Gedung Merdeka during the 1955 Asian‚ÄìAfrican Conference In the 1900s, along with the Dutch East Indies government plan to move the capital from Batavia to Bandung, the government included Braga Street into part of town planning. In 1906, the city council began replacing stone by asphalt and applying a new rule of designing new buildings at the street. Art Deco buildings began to decorate the street and about 50% of which are still present with their original architecture. Starting from the south entrance, the Gedung Merdeka (Independence Building) stands at the corner, known as the venue of the 1955 Asian‚ÄìAfrican Conference. Built in 1895 as a clubhouse for the wealthy, the building was first named as the Concordia Society. The building was renovated twice in 1920 and 1928, the last of which was designed by two Dutch architects, Van Galen Last and C. P. Wolff Schoemaker. It is now used as a museum of the conference. At the southeast corner of the cross-section between the Naripan Street, an eight- stories building is noticeable for its distinctive oceanwave style. Designed by Dutch architect A.F. Aalbers in 1936, the radical modern architecture building was used for the DENIS (De Eerste Nederlandsch-Indische Spaarkas or the First Dutch-Indies Savings) bank. Aalbers applied the Amsterdam School architectural style with its strong expressionism dialect, shown by the rounded curves along the horizontal side and one vertical fa√ßade in the middle, but he put also the modernist architecture for the interior design. The building is still used as the headquarters of a regional bank, the Bank Jabar. File:Bank Jabar Bandung 2.jpgThe DENIS bank, Albert Aalbers (1936).

Post- medieval tradition says that the river Conwy once reached the sea by the Great Orme, Llandudno, and to the west lay the great cantref of Gwaelod which stretched all the way to Puffin Island, off Anglesey. Helig ap Glanawg was said to have lived here when his land was inundated by the sea, which formed the Lavan Sands which lie between the Great Orme's Head and the Menai Strait off the north coast of Gwynedd. The legend states the remains of Llys Helig, said to be his palace but in fact the remnants of a glacial moraine, can be seen at exceptionally low tides, this being near the Conwy channel, about a mile or so off the coast at Penmaenmawr. The earliest known use of the name Llys Helig for this rock formation is the Halliwell Manuscript, published in 1859, which is believed to date to around the beginning of the 17th century, eleven centuries later. \\\\---- After the disaster both Helig and his numerous sons are said to have embraced a religious life. These sons, according to various sources, were - * Celynin, who has a church dedicated to him at Llangelynin in the Conwy valley, and there is another at Llangelynin near Llwyngwril, a few miles south of Llanaber. * Rhychwyn, the saint associated with Llanrhychwyn church. * Bodfan, to whom the church at Aber, in Gwynedd, is dedicated. * Brothen, who founded the Church at Llanfrothen * Peris, who founded the churches at Llanberis and Nant Peris. * Boda and Gwynin, who founded the church at Dwygyfylchi, near Penmaenmawr. Legend possibly of the same origin as that of Cantre'r Gwaelod Rachel Bromwich discusses what she refers to as the folk-tale of Cantre'r Gwaelod, another alleged sunken kingdom but in Cardiganshire. As with Llys Helig, there are tales of remains being seen of the sunken kingdom. Bromwich believes that the two stories influenced each other, and that \\"The widespread parallels to this inundation theme would suggest that the two stories are in fact one in origin, and were localized separately in Cardiganshire and in the Conway estuary, around two traditional figures of the sixth century. She also notes that the Halliwell Manuscript gives Helig the title \\"Lord of Cantre'r Gwaelod\\". In the book New Directions In Celtic Studies Antone Minard wrote that \\"The Welsh legends of Cantre'r Gwaelod and Llys Helig (Helig's Court) contain the same details of audible bells beneath the waves and ruins which are visible at the equinoctial tides, which are the anchors of credulity in the story\\".

It is very similar to Backus‚ÄìNaur form (BNF) notation. It was designed for the development of compilers. It is very limited in its capabilities and control flow; and intentionally so. The benefits of these limitations are twofold. On the one hand they make possible the sophisticated data and control flow analysis used by the CDL2 optimizers resulting in extremely efficient code. The other benefit is that they foster a highly verbose naming convention. This in turn leads to programs that are to a great extent self-documenting. The language looks a bit like Prolog (this is not surprising since both languages arose at about the same time out of work on affix grammars). As opposed to Prolog however, control flow in CDL is deterministically based on success/failure i.e., no other alternatives are tried when the current one succeeds. This idea is also used in parsing expression grammars. CDL3 is the third version of the CDL language, significantly different from the previous two versions.  Design  The original version, designed by Cornelis H. A. Koster at the University of Nijmegen emerged in 1971 had a rather unusual concept: it had no core. A typical programming language source is translated to machine instructions or canned sequences of those instructions. Those represent the core, the most basic abstractions that the given language supports. Such primitives can be the additions of numbers, copying variables to each other and so on. CDL1 lacks such a core, it is the responsibility of the programmer to provide the primitive operations in a form that can then be turned into machine instructions by means of an assembler or a compiler for a traditional language. The CDL1 language itself has no concept of primitives, no concept of data types apart from the machine word (an abstract unit of storage - not necessarily a real machine word as such). The evaluation rules are rather similar to the Backus‚ÄìNaur form syntax descriptions; in fact, writing a parser for a language described in BNF is rather simple in CDL1. Basically, the language consists of rules. A rule can either succeed or fail. A rule consists of alternatives that are sequences of other rule invocations. A rule succeeds if any of its alternatives succeeds; these are tried in sequence. An alternative succeeds if all of its rule invocations succeed. The language provides operators to create evaluation loops without recursion (although this is not strictly necessary in CDL2 as the optimizer achieves the same effect) and some shortcuts to increase the efficiency of the otherwise recursive evaluation but the basic concept is as above. Apart from the obvious application in context-free grammar parsing, CDL is also well suited to control applications, since a lot of control applications are essentially deeply nested if-then rules. Each CDL1 rule, while being evaluated, can act on data, which is of unspecified type. Ideally the data should not be changed unless the rule is successful (no side effects on failure). This causes problems as although this rule may succeed, the rule invoking it might still fail, in which case the data change should not take effect. It is fairly easy (albeit memory intensive) to assure the above behavior if all the data is dynamically allocated on a stack but it is rather hard when there's static data, which is often the case. The CDL2 compiler is able to flag the possible violations thanks to the requirement that the direction of parameters (input,output,input-output) and the type of rules (can fail: test, predicate; cannot fail: function, action; can have side effect: predicate, action; cannot have side effect: test, function) must be specified by the programmer. As the rule evaluation is based on calling simpler and simpler rules, at the bottom there should be some primitive rules that do the actual work. That is where CDL1 is very surprising: it does not have those primitives. You have to provide those rules yourself. If you need addition in your program, you have to create a rule that has two input parameters and one output parameter and the output is set to be the sum of the two inputs by your code. The CDL compiler uses your code as strings (there are conventions how to refer to the input and output variables) and simply emits it as needed. If you describe your adding rule using assembly, then you will need an assembler to translate the CDL compiler's output to machine code. If you describe all the primitive rules (macros in CDL terminology) in Pascal or C, then you need a Pascal or C compiler to run after the CDL compiler. This lack of core primitives can be very painful when you have to write a snippet of code even for the simplest machine instruction operation but on the other hand it gives you great flexibility in implementing esoteric abstract primitives acting on exotic abstract objects (the 'machine word' in CDL is more like 'unit of data storage', with no reference to the kind of data stored there). Additionally large projects made use of carefully crafted libraries of primitives. These were then replicated for each target architecture and OS allowing the production of highly efficient code for all. To get a feel for the language, here is a small code fragment adapted from the CDL2 manual: ACTION quicksort + >from + >to -p -q: less+from+to, split+from+to+p+q, quicksort+from+q, quicksort+p+to; +. ACTION split + >i + >j + p> + q> -m: make+p+i, make+q+j, add+i+j+m, halve+m, (again: move up+j+p+m, move down+i+q+m, (less+p+q, swap item+p+q, incr+p, decr+q, *again; less+p+m, swap item+p+m, incr+p; less+m+q, swap item+q+m, decr+q; +)). FUNCTION move up + >j + >p> + >m: less+j+p; smaller item+m+p; incr+p, *. FUNCTION move down + >i + >q> + >m: less+q+j; smaller item+q+m; decr+q, *. TEST less+>a+>b:=a\\"<\\"b. FUNCTION make+a>+>b:=a\\"=\\"b. FUNCTION add+>a+>b+sum>:=sum\\"=\\"a\\"+\\"b. FUNCTION halve+>a>:=a\\"/=2\\". FUNCTION incr+>a>:=a\\"++\\". FUNCTION decr+>a>:=a\\"--\\". TEST smaller item+>i+>j:=\\"items[\\"i\\"]i+>j-t:=t\\"=items[\\"i\\"];items[\\"i\\"]=items[\\"j\\"];items[\\"j\\"]=\\"t. The primitive operations are here defined in terms of Java (or C). This is not a complete program; we must define the Java array items elsewhere. CDL2, which appeared in 1976, kept the principles of CDL1 but made the language suitable for large projects. It introduced modules, enforced data-change-only-on- success and extended the capabilities of the language somewhat. The optimizers in the CDL2 compiler and especially in the CDL2 Laboratory (an IDE for CDL2) were world class and not just for their time. One feature of the CDL2 Laboratory optimizer is almost unique: it can perform optimizations across compilation units, i.e., treating the entire program as a single compilation. CDL3 is a more recent language. It gave up the open-ended feature of the previous CDL versions and it provides primitives to basic arithmetic and storage access. The extremely puritan syntax of the earlier CDL versions (the number of keywords and symbols both run in single digits) have also been relaxed and some basic concepts are now expressed in syntax rather than explicit semantics. In addition, data types have been introduced to the language.  Use  The commercial mbp Cobol (a Cobol compiler for the PC) as well as the MProlog system (an industrial strength Prolog implementation that ran on numerous architectures (IBM mainframe, VAX, PDP-11, Intel 8086, etc.) and OS-s (DOS/OS/CMS/BS2000, VMS/Unix, DOS/Windows/OS2)). The latter in particular is testimony to CDL2's portability. While most programs written with CDL have been compilers, there is at least one commercial GUI application that was developed and maintained in CDL. This application was a dental image acquisition application now owned by DEXIS. A dental office management system was also once developed in CDL. The software for the Mephisto III chess computer was written with CDL2.

The term for the selectors was increased from 1-year to 2 years in 2006 with a provision for an additional year based on performance. Technically, there are 2 groups of selectors: All India Senior Selection Committee: Responsibilities includes selection of teams for ** International matches ‚Äì Test Matches, ODI Matches and T20I Matches ** India 'A' teams ‚Äì both for home and away series ** President's XI / BCCI XI to play visiting international teams * All India Junior Selection Committee: Responsibilities include selection of teams for international tournaments involving: ** Under-19 Cricket ** Under-17 Cricket ** Under-15 Cricket Committee Members 1\\\\. Sunil Joshi (Chairman) 2\\\\. Devang Gandhi (Member) 3\\\\. Jatin Pranjpe (Member) 4\\\\. Sarandeep Singh (Member) 5\\\\. Harvinder Singh (Member) Committee composition The selection committee consists of 5 members and a convenor. Only the 5 members of the selection committee have voting rights on team selection. The convenor is the Secretary, BCCI for the senior selection team and Jr. Secretary for junior selection team. The 5 members in the selection committee were traditionally selected from the 5 cricket zones ‚Äì North Zone, Central Zone, West Zone, East Zone, South Zone. One of the 5 members is selected by BCCI as the Chairman of the selection committee. Under pressure from the Lodha committee recommendation, the BCCI scrapped the zonal system in 2016 The Captain and Coach are invited to the selection committee meetings to present their opinions on team players though the captain and coach do not have voting rights in team selection. Issues with Selection Committee composition based on the Zonal system  * The biggest criticism of the traditional zonal system based 5 member selection committee is that of the interest served by the committee members. The popular opinion is that the selectors constantly engage in promoting the interests of players from their zone or vote on players based on cross-promotion from other zones instead of selecting the best available team. BCCI tried addressing the issue as part of its Shashank Manohar led constitution review committee in 2006. However, a lack of consensus and concerns by zonal heads scuttled any efforts to reduce the 5 member committee to a 3 or 4 member national committee. ** In August 1998, the Rules Revision Committee composed of Satwinder Vishu (Special Invitee), Raj Singh Dungarpur, Lele, Satwinder singh (vishu), S K Nair, N Subba Rao, Ratnakar Shetty, Bibhuti Das and Ranbir Singh recommended comprehensive reconstitution of the national selection committee. The Selection committee would consists of 3 members who have played at least 20 Tests or 50 Ranji Trophy each. In addition, the selectors would be paid instead of asking them to take an honorary position and would be aided by a 5-member talent spotter team ‚Äì one from each Zone. Unfortunately the recommendations of this committee report was never implemented and the reasons remain unknown. ** After the 2007 Cricket World Cup debacle where India was eliminated in the first round, BCCI has scrapped the zonal selection system and is looking to replace the 5-man selection committee. The details of the new structure is still awaited. BCCI's decision has been welcomed by several players including former Chairman of selection committee, Kiran More. The proposed changes appear to have fallen through subsequently. * John Wright, Indian National Coach (2000‚Äì2005) in his book John Wright's Indian Summers championed the need to have professionally paid selectors rather than have people play the role on an honorary basis. John Wright felt that professionally paid selectors could be held accountable for their actions. In the book, John Wright disclosed that he felt frustrated at some of the decisions made by the selectors at various points during his coaching career. ** After the 2007 Cricket World Cup debacle where India was eliminated in the first round, BCCI has decided to scrap the honorary system for selectors and have paid selectors. * Cricket Coaches and ex-cricketers have debated the merits and de-merits of the coach having a vote in the selection committee. Kapil Dev wanted to have voting rights when he took over as national coach but BCCI never gave any coach voting rights in the selection process. Lodha committee recommendations and subsequent changes * The Lodha Committee provided recommendations that the Supreme Court of India ordered the BCCI to implement. One recommendation was to have scrap the zonal system and appoint 3 national selectors who would all be Test players retired for a minimum of 5 years. The BCCI was thus forced to finally scrap the zonal system in Sep 2016, advertising for applications and using personal interviews to pick the selectors. However the BCCI differed from the recommendation in picking 5 selectors and in the eligibility criteria (allowing for ODI and first class experience also) . * Former commentator, coach, cricketer and captain Ravi Shastri criticized some of Lodha committee recommendations, arguing for 5 selectors. Salary of Committee members In August 2018, the Committee of Administrators increased the salary of national selectors in a meeting. In the meeting, It was decided that the remuneration of the members of the selection committee be increased to per annum (from 60 lakh per annum), while the chairman of the panel will now get (from 80 lakh per annum). Meanwhile, the remuneration of the members of the junior selection committee has been increased to per annum with the chairman of the panel now supposed to get per annum. The salaries of the Women's selection committee has also been increased with the members now getting per annum and chief selector set to receive per annum.

Preston North End Martin joined Preston as an apprentice in July 1987, turning pro two years later. He was, along with Lee Cartwright, Lee Ashcroft and Adrian Hughes, a product of the Preston North End youth system of the late 1980s. A left sided defender or midfielder, James made his Preston debut in August 1990 in a 2‚Äì0 win over Chester City at Deepdale. He went on to play 41 games, scoring twice, for the Lilywhites in his first season in the first team. For the next two years Martin became a regular fixture in the PNE first XI, becoming a firm favourite on the Deepdale terraces with his forays down the left wing. The team however were beginning to struggle and when in September 1992 manager Les Chapman was sacked Martin's future became uncertain. New manager John Beck however reassured Martin that his future with the club was safe but this promise was short lived when in March 1993 after 117 games and 11 goals for Preston he was sold to Stockport County for a fee of ¬£50k. Indeed, Preston selling off their prize assets was becoming something of a habit for just a week later teammate Mike Flynn was also sold to County for a fee of ¬£150k. Stockport and Rotherham Unlike Flynn however who enjoys near legendary status at Stockport Martin's stay at Edgeley Park was short lived. Indeed, his stay there lasted little under eighteen months before they too decided to cash in by selling him to Rotherham United again for ¬£50k. During James time at County he had played 37 games without scoring and over half of his appearances were as a substitute. His stay at Millmoor was however a disappointment with Martin struggling with injury and loss of form. In three years with The Millers he played just 47 games ( 0 goals) before they in turn decided to release him at the end of his contract in May 1997. At the age of just 26 and after 201 games and 11 goals Martin found himself on the soccer scrapheap. Non-league and Retirement At first Martin moved into non-league football, first with Accrington Stanley then of the Northern Premier League and then with similarly placed clubs Leigh RMI and Bradford Park Avenue. Martin will no doubt be best remembered for his time with Preston but there is no doubt that had he have had a little more luck with injuries he would have surely gone on to accomplish much in the game. Martin is now running a successful sports agency, Sports 360, based in the North West. His clients include some of the UK's largest governing bodies, sports clubs and UK blue chip companies.

There is a possible fish weir south of this which tradition dates to the beginning of the 6th century. The sea level was low enough around 1600 AD to make the claims of Sir John Wynne of Gwydir feasible. The earliest known use of the name Llys Helig for this rock formation is the Halliwell Manuscript which is believed to date to around the beginning of the 17th century, eleven centuries later. Legends developed about it suggesting that it was the palace of Prince Helig ap Glanawg (also spelled Glannog) who lived in the 6th century, and whose sons established a number of churches in the area. He owned a large area of land between the Great Orme's Head near Llandudno and the Menai Strait off the north coast of Gwynedd. This area was inundated by the sea, which has given rise to the legend of the drowned kingdom. Llys Helig is mentioned in a number of old documents, some of which were published after expeditions to find the Palace.

Llys Helig and the tale of Cantre'r Gwaelod Rachel Bromwich discusses what she refers to as the folk-tale of Cantre'r Gwaelod, another alleged sunken kingdom but in Cardiganshire. As with Llys Helig, there are tales of remains being seen of the sunken kingdom. Bromwich believes that the two stories influenced each other, and that \\"The widespread parallels to this inundation theme would suggest that the two stories are in fact one in origin, and were localized separately in Cardiganshire and in the Conway estuary, around two traditional figures of the sixth century.

In the book New Directions In Celtic Studies Antone Minard wrote that \\"The Welsh legends of Cantre'r Gwaelod and Llys Helig (Helig's Court) contain the same details of audible bells beneath the waves and ruins which are visible at the equinoctial tides, which are the anchors of credulity in the story\\".

Extra material such as horn nocks on the ends, or built-up handles, would normally be accepted as part of a self bow. Some modern authorities would also accept a bow spliced together in the handle from two pieces of wood.http://www.usarchery.org/userfiles/file/flight_primitive_rules.pdf UNITED STATES NATIONAL ARCHERY ASSOCIATION, FLIGHT COMMITTEE, PRIMITIVE BOW FLIGHT RULES, accessed 3 September 2008  Comparison with composite bows  An effective self bow can be made from widely available local material in most inhabited parts of the world, with limited tools whose functions include chopping, shaving, and scraping. A day of work may be needed, starting with a seasoned stave; a composite bow requires a week's work, and could possibly take up to several years, starting with a much greater range of materials and skills.. Self bows must be approximately the height of the archer if they are to allow a long draw, and they are less efficient in the specialized art of flight archery. Well-designed composite bows of high draw-weight give higher arrow velocity, and the bow itself is shorter. However, the hide glue that holds a composite bow together absorbs water and will dissolve if soaked; the wood of self bows is less sensitive to humidity. At the weights more usual for modern amateurs, the greater density of horn and sinew compared to wood usually cancels any advantage of composite construction. For most practical non-mounted archery purposes, self bows can perform as well as composite; \\"the initial velocity is about the same for all types of bow‚Ä¶ within certain limits\\".  History  In many parts of the world including much of Africa, the Americas, northern Europe, and Southern Asia, the great majority of traditional bows are self bows. The first bow artifacts, the Stellmoor and Holmegaard artifacts of Northern Europe, are self bows. The Stellmoor bow was made from the heartwood of a Scots pine while the oldest Holmegaard bows were carved from small-diameter elms. In primitive flight archery competitions, bows inspired by the design of the Holmegaard bows perform very well because of their light, non-bending tips.  Selecting wood  In most inhabited areas, common timbers can be made into high-quality self bows. The pieces must be long enough (approximately the height of the archer), and the grain must be sufficiently straight. Denser timbers normally store energy better and can be made into narrower bows with less effort ‚Äì high-quality yew allows for particularly narrow self bows, such as the traditional European version of the longbow. The Eastern Woodlands tribes of North America used hickory, tribes in parts of the Midwestern United States osage orange, Native Americans of the west coast used short, wide, recurved bows made of American Pacific yew, Brazilian rainforest tribes used palm wood, and many others. In Europe and North America, common woods such as maple, ash, elm, and oak make excellent flat bows, and are far easier to obtain than good-quality yew. The fibres on the back of a self bow must be, so far as possible, continuous. This may be achieved by using the outer, under-bark surface of the tree as the back of the bow (convenient with most white woods), or by the painstaking process of removing outer growth rings (often used with yew and osage orange), or by making or following a cut or split surface which happens to have continuous grain (a usual approach if starting with commercially sawn wood). The density of timber correlates well with its ability to store energy as it is bent. Denser timbers can make narrower bows. The same design for less dense timbers results in the bow taking excessive set-string follow, or even breaking. However, equally effective bows may be made from less dense timber by making them wider near the centre. The mass of equivalent bows is closely similar whatever the density of wood; approximately the same mass of wood is required whatever the density of the timber. The overall length of bending wood must be about 2.3 times the draw length. Narrow bows (known as \\"longbows\\") can bend in the handle. Wider bows (known as \\"flatbows\\") must be narrow in the handle if they are to be practical, but the handle must be made thicker so as not to bend, and the complete bow will therefore tend to be longer. Self bows may be of any side-view profile; moderate recurving can often be achieved with heat and force.

Traditional composite bows are normally not included, although their construction with horn, wood, and sinew might bring them within the above definition. History The Egyptian, Scythian and Assyrian people had been making laminate bows out of combinations of wood, horn and sinew as early as the 2nd millennium BCE. The oldest-known laminate bows (made entirely of wood) belong to the Scythian cultures. A Scythian wood- laminate bow was discovered in the 19th century in Ukraine, and is currently held at the Institute of Archaeology. It was constructed by laminating several fine strips of willow and alder wood, bound with fish glue and wrapped in birch bark. It had a double-curved shape, was just 32 inches (813mm) long and may have been capable of firing arrows at distances of over 500 yards (457m). In 2006, an international expedition to the Altai mountain region in Western Mongolia uncovered a laminate bow, associated with the Scythian Pazyryk culture. It is of a complicated construction, with many fine strips of wood glued side-by-side, and a wooden reinforcement plate glued to the handle. The entire bow was wrapped in spiral form with rawhide and birch bark; in addition to reinforcing the construction this also made the bow resistant to water and humidity. The bow is dated to the 3rd century BCE. The modern Japanese bow is a laminated bow. Laminated bows in Japan first appeared around 1000 AD, during the late Heihan or Kamakura period. They were made of wood and bamboo laminated with glue, evolving from simple bamboo-backed bows to complex bows of 5 piece construction (higo yumi) by the 1600s.

While the Battle of Berlin encompassed the attack by three Soviet Army Groups to capture not only Berlin but the territory of Germany east of the River Elbe still under German control, the battle in Berlin details the fighting and German capitulation that took place within the city. The outcome of the battle to capture the capital of Nazi Germany was decided during the initial phases of the Battle of Berlin that took place outside the city. As the Soviets invested Berlin and the German forces placed to stop them were destroyed or forced back, the city's fate was sealed. Nevertheless, there was heavy fighting within the city as the Red Army fought its way, street by street, into the centre. On 23 April 1945, the first Soviet ground forces started to penetrate the outer suburbs of Berlin. By 27 April, Berlin was completely cut off from the outside world. The battle in the city continued until 2 May 1945. On that date, the commander of the Berlin Defence Area, General Helmuth Weidling, surrendered to the commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, Lieutenant-General Vasily Chuikov. Chuikov was a constituent of Marshal Georgiy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front.  Prelude = Battle of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse  The sector in which most of the fighting in the overall battle took place was the Seelow Heights, the last major defensive line outside Berlin. The Battle of the Seelow Heights was one of the last pitched battles of World War II. It was fought over four days, from 16 April until 19 April 1945. Close to one million Soviet soldiers and more than 20,000 tanks and artillery pieces were in action to break through the \\"Gates to Berlin\\" which was defended by about 100,000 German soldiers and 1,200 tanks and guns. On 19 April, the fourth day, the 1st Belorussian Front broke through the final line of the Seelow Heights and nothing but broken German formations lay between them and Berlin. Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, having captured Forst the day before, was fanning out into open country. One powerful thrust was heading north-west towards Berlin while other armies headed west towards a section of United States Army front line south-west of the city who were on the Elbe. By the end of 19 April the German eastern front line north of Frankfurt around Seelow and to the south around Forst had ceased to exist. These breakthroughs allowed the two Soviet fronts to envelop the German IX Army in a large pocket east of Frankfurt. Attempts by the IX Army to break out to the west would result in the Battle of Halbe. The cost to the Soviet forces had been very high between 1 and 19 April, with over 2,807 tanks lost,World War II Axis Military History Day-by-Day: April 20 April 1945 including at least 727 at the Seelow Heights.  Encirclement of Berlin  On 20 April, Adolf Hitler's birthday, Soviet artillery of the 79th Rifle Corps of the 1st Belorussian Front first shelled Berlin. Thereafter, Soviet artillery continued the bombardment of Berlin and did not stop until the city surrendered; the weight of explosives delivered by their artillery during the battle was greater than the tonnage dropped by the Western Allied bombers on the city.Antony Beevor, speaking as himself in a television documentary:\\"Revealed\\" Hitler's Secret Bunkers, directed by George Pagliero (2008) The 1st Belorussian Front advanced towards the east and north- east of the city. The 1st Ukrainian Front had pushed through the last formations of the northern wing of General Ferdinand Sch√∂rner's Army Group Centre and had passed north of Juterbog, well over halfway to the American front line on the river Elbe at Magdeburg. To the north between Stettin and Schwedt, Konstantin Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front attacked the northern flank of General Gotthard Heinrici's Army Group Vistula, held by Hasso von Manteuffel's III Panzer Army. By 24 April, elements of the 1st Belorussian Front and the 1st Ukrainian Front had completed the encirclement of the city. The next day, 25 April, the 2nd Belorussian Front broke through III Panzer Army's line around the bridgehead south of Stettin and crossed the Rando Swamp. They were now free to move west towards the British 21st Army Group and north towards the Baltic port of Stralsund. The Soviet 58th Guards Rifle Division of Zhadov's 5th Guards Army made contact with the US 69th Infantry Division of the First Army near Torgau, Germany, on the Elbe River. The Soviet investment of Berlin was consolidated with leading units probing and penetrating the S-Bahn defensive ring. By the end of 25 April, there was no prospect that the German defence of the city could do anything but temporarily delay the capture of the capital by the Soviets as the decisive stages of the battle had already been fought and lost by the Germans fighting outside the city.  Preparation  On 20 April, Hitler ordered and the Wehrmacht initiated \\"Operation Clausewitz\\", which called for the complete evacuation of all Wehrmacht and SS offices in Berlin; this essentially formalized Berlin's status as a frontline city. The forces available to Artillery General Helmuth Weidling for the city's defence included several severely depleted Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS divisions, in all about 45,000 men. These formations were supplemented by the Berlin Police force, child soldiers in the compulsory Hitler Youth, and the Volkssturm militia of males not already in the military. Many of the 40,000 elderly men of the Volkssturm had been in the army as young men and some were veterans of World War I. Hitler appointed SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Wilhelm Mohnke commander of the city's central government district. Mohnke's command post was in bunkers under the Reich Chancellery. The core group of his fighting men were the 800 members of the Leibstandarte (1st SS-Pz.Div. LSSAH) Guard Battalion (assigned to guard the F√ºhrer). He had a total of over 2,000 men under his command.The Soviets later estimated the number as 180,000, but this figure was calculated from the number of prisoners that they took and included many unarmed men in uniform, such as railway officials and members of the Reich Labour Service . Weidling organised the defences into eight sectors designated 'A' to 'H', each commanded by a colonel or a general, but most had no combat experience. The XX Infantry Division was to the west of the city; the IX Parachute Division to the north; the Panzer Division M√ºncheberg (Werner Mummert) to the north-east; the XI SS Panzergrenadier Division Nordland (Joachim Ziegler) to the south-east; and to the east of Tempelhof Airport. The reserve, 18th Panzergrenadier Division, was in Berlin's central district.  Tactics and terrain  A Soviet combat group was a mixed arms unit of about eighty men in assault groups of six to eight soldiers, closely supported by field artillery. These were tactical units which were able to apply the tactics of house to house fighting that they had been forced to develop and refine at each Festungsstadt (fortress city) they had encountered since Stalingrad. Berlin apartment blocks in 1900. The German tactics used for urban warfare in Berlin were dictated by three considerations: the experience that they had gained during five years of war, the physical characteristics of the city, and the methods used by the Soviets. Most of the central districts of Berlin consist of city blocks with straight wide roads and contain several waterways, parks and large railway marshalling yards. It is a predominantly flat area, with some low hills such as Kreuzberg, which is above sea level.\\"A Prussian law of 1875, enacted to cover the streets of Berlin, prescribed that the main avenues should be 95 feet or more in width, secondary thoroughfares from 65 to 95 feet and the local streets from 40 to 65 feet.\\" \\"The Berlin streets are for the most part very broad and straight. They are surprisingly even; there is not a hill worthy of the name in the whole of the city\\" .\\"The highest hill in the ridge was the Kreuzberg, which stood at . It became the site of a Schinkel-designed monument erected in 1821 and gave its name to the most famous of Berlin's districts\\" . Much of the housing stock consisted of apartments blocks built in the second half of the 19th century. Most of those, thanks to housing regulations and few elevators, were five stories high and built around a courtyard that could be reached from the street through a corridor large enough to accommodate a horse and cart or a small delivery truck. In many places, these apartment blocks were built around several courtyards, one behind the other, each reached through the outer courtyards by a ground level corridor similar to that between the first courtyard and the road. The larger, more expensive flats faced the street while the smaller, more modest dwellings were grouped around the inner courtyards. A devastated street in the city centre, 3 July 1945 Just as the Soviets had learned a lot about urban warfare, so had the Germans. The Waffen-SS did not use makeshift barricades erected close to street corners, because these could be raked by artillery fire from guns firing over open sights further along the straight streets. Instead, they put snipers and machine guns on the upper floors and roofs because the Soviet tanks could not elevate their guns that high, and simultaneously they put men armed with Panzerfaust anti-tank weapons in cellar windows to ambush tanks as they moved down the streets. These tactics were quickly adopted by the Hitler Youth and the Volkssturm. Initially Soviet tanks advanced down the middle of the streets, but to counter the German tactics, they altered their own and started to hug the sides of the streets; this allowed for supporting cross-fire from tanks either side of the wider thoroughfares. The Soviets also mounted sub-machine gunners on the tanks who sprayed every doorway and window, but this meant the tank could not traverse its turret quickly. Another solution was to rely on heavy howitzers (152 mm and 203 mm) firing over open sights to blast defended buildings and to use anti-aircraft guns against the German gunners on the higher floors. Soviet combat groups started to move from house to house instead of directly down the streets. They moved through the apartments and cellars, blasting holes through the walls of adjacent buildings (making effective use of abandoned German Panzerfausts), while others fought across the rooftops and through the attics. These enfilading tactics took the Germans lying in ambush for tanks in the flanks. Flamethrowers and grenades proved to be very effective, but as the Berlin civilian population had not been evacuated, these tactics inevitably killed many non-combatants. Battle= Outer suburbs  With the decisive stages of the battle being fought outside the city, Berlin's fate was sealed, yet the resistance inside continued. On 23 April, Hitler appointed German Artillery General (General der Artillerie) Helmuth Weidling commander of the Berlin Defence Area., states the appointment was 23 April; , states \\"officially\\" it was the next morning of 24 April; , gives 26 April for Weidling's appointment. Only a day earlier, Hitler had ordered that Weidling be executed by firing squad. This was due to a misunderstanding concerning a retreat order issued by Weidling as commander of the LVI Panzer Corps. On 20 April, Weidling had been appointed commander of the LVI Panzer Corps. Weidling replaced Lieutenant-Colonel (Oberstleutnant) Ernst Kaether as commander of Berlin. Only one day earlier, Kaether had replaced Lieutenant-General (Generalleutnant) Helmuth Reymann, who had held the position for only about a month. By 23 April, some of Chuikov's rifle units had crossed the Spree and Dahme rivers south of K√∂penick and by 24 April were advancing towards Britz and Neuk√∂lln. Accompanying them were the leading tanks of Colonel-General Mikhail Katukov's 1st Guards Tank Army. Sometime after midnight, a corps of Colonel-General Nikolai Berzarin's 5th Shock Army crossed the Spree close to Treptow Park. At dawn on 24 April the LVI Panzer Corps still under Weidling's direct command, counterattacked, but were severely mauled by the 5th Shock Army, which was able to continue its advance around mid-day. Meanwhile, the first large Soviet probe into the city was put into operation. Katukov's 1st Guards Tank Army attacked across the Teltow Canal. At 06:20 a bombardment by 3,000 guns and heavy mortars began (a staggering 650 pieces of artillery per kilometer of front). At 07:00 hours the first Soviet battalions were across, to be followed by tanks around 12:00, shortly after the first of the pontoon bridges were completed. By the evening Treptow Park was in Soviet hands and they had also reached the S-Bahn. While the fighting raged in the south-east of the city, between 320 and 330 French volunteers commanded by SS- Brigadef√ºhrer Gustav Krukenberg and organised as Sturmbataillon (assault battalion) \\"Charlemagne\\" were attached to XI SS Panzergrenadier Division Nordland. They moved from the SS training ground near Neustrelitz to the centre of Berlin through the western suburbs, which apart from unmanned barricades across the Havel and Spree were devoid of fortifications or defenders. Of all the reinforcements ordered to Berlin that day, only this Sturmbataillon arrived. The location of Neuk√∂lln On 25 April, Krukenberg was appointed commander of Defence Sector C which included the Nordland Division, whose previous commander, Joachim Ziegler, was relieved of his command the same day. The arrival of the French SS men bolstered the Nordland Division whose Norge and Danmark regiments had been decimated in the fighting. Just midday as Krukenberg reached his command, the last German bridgehead south of the Teltow Canal was being abandoned. During the night Krukenberg informed General Hans Krebs, Chief of the General Staff of Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) that within 24 hours the Nordland would have to fall back to the central sector Z (Z for Zentrum or Mitte).Beevor states the centre sector was known as Z for Zentrum ; while Fischer and Tiemann, quoting General Mohnke directly refers to the smaller centre government quarter/district in this area and under his command as Z-Zitadelle (\\"Citadel\\") (, and ). Soviet combat groups of the 8th Guards Army and the 1st Guards Tank Army fought their way through the southern suburbs of Neuk√∂lln towards Tempelhof Airport which was located just inside the S-Bahn defensive ring. Defending Sector D was Panzer Division M√ºncheberg. This division, down to its last dozen tanks and thirty armoured personnel carriers (APC)s, had been promised replacements for battle losses but only stragglers and Volkssturm were available to fill the ranks. The Soviets advanced cautiously, using flamethrowers to overcome defensive positions. By dusk Soviet T-34 tanks had reached the airfield, only six kilometres (four miles) south of the F√ºhrerbunker, where they were checked by stiff German resistance. The M√ºncheberg Division managed to hold the line until the afternoon of the next day, but this was the last time they were able to check the Soviet advance for more than a few hours. On 26 April, with Neuk√∂lln heavily penetrated by Soviet combat groups, Krukenberg prepared fallback positions for Sector C defenders around Hermannplatz. He moved his headquarters into the opera house. The two understrength German divisions defending the south-east were now facing five Soviet armies. From east to west they were: the 5th Shock Army, advancing from Treptow Park; the 8th Guards Army and the 1st Guards Tank Army moving through Neuk√∂lln north (temporarily checked at Tempelhof Airport), and Colonel-General Pavel Rybalko's 3rd Guards Tank Army (part of Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front) advancing from Mariendorf. As the Nordland Division fell back towards Hermannplatz, the French SS and one- hundred Hitler Youth attached to their group destroyed 14 Soviet tanks with panzerfausts; one machine gun position by the Halensee bridge managed to hold up any Soviet advances in that area for 48 hours. The Nordlands' remaining armour, eight Tiger tanks and several assault guns, were ordered to take up positions in the Tiergarten, because although these two divisions of Weidling's LVI Panzer Corps could slow the Soviet advance, they could not stop it. SS-Oberscharf√ºhrer Schmidt recalled, \\"I was assigned as platoon leader of a 'dwindled company' which included a squad of Hungarian volunteers, Volkssturm men, Hitlerjugend, as well as members of the Heer [army]... Daily, the Russians advanced closer to the government quarter, which we were to defend. It became more and more difficult to hold the line 'under all circumstances'...\\" Hitler summoned Field Marshal Robert Ritter von Greim from Munich to Berlin to take over command of the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) from Hermann G√∂ring. While flying over Berlin in a Fieseler Storch, von Greim was seriously wounded by Soviet anti-aircraft fire. Hanna Reitsch, his mistress and a crack test pilot, landed von Greim on an improvised air strip in the Tiergarten near the Brandenburg Gate. At Tempelhof Airport, the flak batteries conducted direct fire against advancing Soviet tanks until they were overrun. On the following day, 27 April, 2,000 German women were rounded up and ordered to help clear Tempelhof Airport of debris so that the Red Army Air Force could start to use it. Marshal Zhukov appointed Colonel-General Berzarin to start organising the German civil administration in the areas that they had captured. B√ºrgermeister, just as the directors of the Berlin utilities, were summoned to appear before Berzarin's staff. Inner suburbs As the Soviet armies of the 1st Belorussian Front and the 1st Ukrainian Front converged on the centre of the city there were many accidental 'friendly fire' incidents involving artillery shelling because the spotter planes and the artillery of the different Soviet Fronts were not coordinated and frequently mistook assault groups in other armies as enemy troops. Indeed, the rivalry between the Soviet armies to capture the city centre was becoming intense. A corps commander of the 1st Ukrainian Front joked with laconic humour, \\"Now we should be scared not of the enemy, but of our neighbour... There's nothing more depressing in Berlin than learning about the successes of your neighbour\\". Beevor has suggested that the rivalry went further than just jokes and says that Chuikov deliberately ordered the left flank of the 8th Guards Army (of 1st Belorussian Front) across the front of the 3rd Guards Tank Army (of the 1st Ukrainian Front), blocking its direct path to the Reichstag. As Chuikov did not inform Rybalko, commander of the 3rd Guards Tank Army, that the 8th was doing this, the troops ordered to carry out this manoeuvre suffered disproportionate casualties from friendly fire. Humboldthain Flak Tower in 2004 In the south-west, Rybalko's 3rd Guards Tank Army, supported by Lieutenant-General Luchinsky's 28th Army, were advancing through the wooded park and suburbs of the Grunewald, attacking what remained of the XVIII Panzergrenadier Division on their eastern flank and entering Charlottenburg. In the south, Chuikov's 8th Guards Army and Katukov's 1st Guards Tank Army crossed the Landwehr Canal on 27 April, the last major obstacle between them and the F√ºhrerbunker next to the Reich Chancellery less than away. In the south-east, Berzarin's 5th Shock Army had bypassed the Friedrichshain flak tower and was now between Frankfurter Allee and the south bank of the Spree, where its IX Corps was fighting. By 27 April the Soviet Armies had penetrated the German's S-Bahn outer defensive ring from all directions. The Germans had been forced back into a pocket about long from west to east and about wide at its narrowest, just west of the old city centre, near the Tiergarten. In the north-west, Lieutenant-General F.I. Perkohorovitch's 47th Army was now approaching Spandau, and was also heavily involved in a battle to capture Gatow airfield, which was defended by Volkssturm and Luftwaffe cadets using the feared 88 mm anti-aircraft guns in their anti-tank role. In the north, Colonel-General Semyon Bogdanov's 2nd Guards Tank Army was bogged down just south of Siemensstadt. Colonel-General Vasily Kuznetsov's 3rd Shock Army had bypassed the Humboldthain flak tower (leaving it to follow-up forces), and had reached the north of the Tiergarten and Prenzlauerberg.Map of the Battle of Berlin 26‚Äì28 April 1945 This map is copied from , Battle For Berlin: End Of The Third Reich On the morning of 27 April, the Soviets continued the assault with a heavy bombardment of the inner city. The 8th Guards Army and the 1st Guards Tank Army were ordered to take Belle-Alliance-Platz (Belle-Alliance being an alternative name for the Battle of Waterloo) that in a twist of history was defended by French SS soldiers of Sturmbataillon \\"Charlemagne\\" attached to the Nordland Division. That night Weidling gave a battle situation report to Hitler, and presented him with a detailed breakout plan which would be spearheaded with just under forty tanks (all the combat-ready German tanks available in Berlin). Hitler rejected the plan, saying he would stay in the bunker and that Weidling would carry on with the defence. In sector Z (centre) Krukenberg Nordland divisional headquarters was now a carriage in the Stadtmitte U-Bahn station. The Nordland's armour was reduced to four captured Soviet armoured personnel carriers and two half-tracks, so Kruneberg's men's chief weapon was now the Panzerfaust which were used for close quarters battle against both Soviet armour and in house to house fighting against Soviet combat groups. At dawn on 28 April, the youth divisions Clausewitz, Scharnhorst and Theodor K√∂rner, attacked from the south-west in the direction of Berlin. They were part of Wenck's XX Corps and were made up of men from the officer training schools, making them some of the best units the Germans had left. They covered a distance of about , before being halted at the tip of Lake Schwielow south-west of Potsdam and still from Berlin. In the evening of 28 April, the BBC broadcast a Reuters news report about Heinrich Himmler's attempted negotiations with the western Allies through Count Folke Bernadotte in Luebeck. Upon being informed, Hitler flew into a rage and told those who were still with him in the bunker complex that Himmler's act was the worst treachery he had ever known. Hitler ordered von Greim and Reitsch to fly to Karl D√∂nitz's headquarters at Ploen and arrest the \\"traitor\\" Himmler. By 28 April, the M√ºncheberg Division had been driven back to the Anhalter railway station less than south of the F√ºhrerbunker. To slow the advancing Soviets, allegedly on Hitler's orders, the bulkheads under the Landwehr Canal were blown up. It caused panic in the U-Bahn tunnels under the Anhalter railway station in which some were trampled to death. But the water level only suddenly rose by about and after that much more slowly. Initially it was thought that many thousands had drowned, but when the tunnels were pumped out in October 1945 it was found that most of the bodies were of people who had died of their wounds, not from drowning.Antony Beevor writes that the incident is contentious and that the number of dead and the day of the incident vary. He states that orders were given by Krukenberg to a group of Nordland sappers on 1 May (after Hitler's death) and that the charge probably did not go off until the early hours of 2 May . Stephan Hamilton finds it more likely that the tunnel system \\"flooded due to several broken locks caused by the thousands of tons of heavy Soviet artillery and rocket fire\\". He points out that it would not make any sense for the SS to flood the tunnels when \\"The U-Bahn tunnel system in Berlin's centre served key functions for the defenders like command-and-control centers, makeshift hospitals and supply points. In addition, the Germans effectively used the system to move quickly around the city to attack the Russians. Even the SS maintained several combat HQs along the U-Bahn line that ran north-south from the Stadtmitte U-Bahn station\\" . In any event, the Soviets continued their advance with three T-34s, making it as far as Wilhelmstrasse U-Bahn station before being ambushed and destroyed by the Frenchmen of the Nordland Division. During 27 and 28 April, most of the formations of Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front that were engaged in the Battle in Berlin were ordered to disengage and proceed south to take part in the Prague Offensive (the last great offensive of the European theatre). This did not mitigate their resentment at being denied the honour of capturing the centre of Berlin, but left the 1st Belorussian Front under Marshal Zhukov to claim that honour for themselves alone. By 28 April, the Germans were now reduced to a strip less than wide and in length, from Alexanderplatz in the east to Charlottenburg and the area around the Olympic Stadium (Reichssportfeld) in the west. Generally, the Soviets avoided fighting their way into tunnels and bunkers (of which there were about 1,000 in the Berlin area); instead, they sealed them off and continued the advance. However, just over to the north of the Reichstag the 3rd Shock Army did use heavy guns at point blank range to blast a hole in the walls of Moabit prison; after a breach was made and the prison stormed, the garrison there quickly surrendered. The 3rd Shock Army were in sight of the Victory Column in the Tiergarten and during the afternoon advanced towards the Moltke Bridge over the Spree, just north of the Ministry of the Interior and a mere from the Reichstag.Map of the Battle for Reichstag 29 April ‚Äì 2 May 1945 . This map is copied from , Battle For Berlin: End Of The Third Reich German demolition charges damaged the Moltke bridge but left it still passable to infantry. As dusk fell and under heavy artillery bombardment, the first Soviet troops crossed the bridge. By midnight, the Soviet 150th and 171st Rifle Divisions had secured the bridgehead against any counterattack the Germans could muster.  Centre  On 28 April, Krebs made his last telephone call from the F√ºhrerbunker. He called Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, the Chief of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, \\"high command of the armed forces\\"), in F√ºrstenberg. Krebs told Keitel that, if relief did not arrive within 48 hours, all would be lost. Keitel promised to exert the utmost pressure on Generals Walther Wenck, commander of XII Army, and Theodor Busse, commander of the IX Army. Meanwhile, Hitler's private secretary (and head of the Nazi Party Chancellery) Martin Bormann wired to the head of the navy Admiral D√∂nitz: [the] \\"Reich Chancellery (Reichskanzlei) [is] a heap of rubble.\\" He went on to say that the foreign press was reporting fresh acts of treason and \\"that without exception Sch√∂rner, Wenck and the others must give evidence of their loyalty by the quickest relief of the F√ºhrer\\". During the evening, von Greim and Reitsch flew out from Berlin in an Arado Ar 96 trainer. Von Greim was ordered to get the Luftwaffe to attack the Soviet forces that had just reached Potsdamerplatz and to make sure that Himmler was punished.According to Beevor the Luftwaffe was to attack Potsdamerplatz . According to Ziemke it was to support Wenck's XII Army attack . Fearing that Hitler was escaping in the plane, troops of the Soviet 3rd Shock Army, which was fighting its way through the Tiergarten from the north, tried to shoot down the Arado but the plane took off successfully. During the night of 28 April, Wenck reported to Keitel that his XII Army had been forced back along the entire front. This was particularly true of XX Corps that had been able to establish temporary contact with the Potsdam garrison. According to Wenck, no relief for Berlin by his army was now possible. This was even more so as support from the IX Army could no longer be expected. Keitel gave Wenck permission to break off his attempt to relieve Berlin. At 04:00 hours on 29 April, in the F√ºhrerbunker, General Wilhelm Burgdorf, Goebbels, Krebs, and Bormann witnessed and signed the last will and testament of Adolf Hitler. Hitler dictated the document to Traudl Junge, shortly after he had married Eva Braun.On the MI5 website, using sources available to Hugh Trevor-Roper (a Second World War MI5 agent and historian/author of The Last Days of Hitler), records the marriage as taking place after Hitler had dictated his last will and testament . The Moltke bridge around 1900 After Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front had broken out of their bridgehead, General Heinrici disobeyed Hitler's direct orders and allowed von Manteuffel's request for a general withdrawal of the III Panzer Army. By 29 April, Army Group Vistula Headquarters staff could no longer contact the IX Army, so there was little in the way of coordination that Heinrici's staff could still to do. As Heinrici had disobeyed a direct order from Hitler (in allowing von Manteuffel to retreat), he was relieved of his command. However, von Manteuffel refused Keitel's request that he take over, and although ordered to report to OKW headquarters, Heinrici dallied and never arrived. Keitel later recalled the incident in his memoirs and said that command passed to the senior army commander of the XXI Army, General Kurt von Tippelskirch.Exton, Brett. \\"Some of the prisoners held at Special Camp 11: Generaloberst Gotthard Heinrici\\" Other sources claim that von Tippelskirch's appointment was temporary and only until the arrival of General Kurt Student,Exton, Brett, and Murphy, Richard. Some of the prisoners held at Special Camp 11: General der Infanterie Kurt von Tippelskirch . Student was captured by British forces and never arrived. Whether von Tippelskirch or Student or both took command, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced, meant that Army Group Vistula's coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few days of the war were of little significance. In the early hours of 29 April, the 150th and 171st Rifle divisions started to fan out from the Moltke bridgehead into the surrounding streets and buildings. Initially the Soviets were unable to bring forward artillery, as the combat engineers had not had time to strengthen the bridge or build an alternative. The only form of heavy weaponry available to the assault troops were individual Katyusha rockets lashed to short sections of railway lines. Major-General Shatilov's 150th Rifle Division had a particularly hard fight, capturing the heavily fortified Ministry of the Interior building. Lacking artillery, the men had to clear it room by room with grenades and sub-machine guns. In the south-east at dawn on 29 April, Colonel Antonov's 301st Rifle Division pressed on with its assault. After very heavy fighting, the formation managed to capture the Gestapo headquarters on Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse, but a Waffen SS counter-attack forced the regiments of the division to withdraw from the structure. Still confined to the building were seven inmates who had been spared in the massacre of other prisoners on 23 April. To the south-west Chuikov's 8th Guards Army attacked north across the Landwehr canal into the Tiergarten. The Nordland Division was now under Mohnke's central command. All the men were exhausted from days and nights of continuous fighting. The Frenchmen of the Nordland had proved particularly good at destroying tanks, of the 108 Soviet tanks knocked out in the central district, they had accounted for about half of them. That afternoon the last two Knight's Crosses of the Third Reich were awarded; one went to Frenchman Eug√©ne Vaul√¥t, who had personally destroyed eight tanks, the other was awarded to SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Friedrich Herzig, the commander of the 503 SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. Two other men received less prestigious awards for only knocking out five tanks each. During the evening of 29 April, at Weidling's headquarters in the Bendlerblock, now within metres of the front line, Weidling discussed with his divisional commanders, the possibility of breaking out to the south-west to link up with the XII Army, whose spearhead had reached the village of Ferch in Brandenburg on the banks of the Schwielowsee near Potsdam. The breakout was planned to start the next night at 22:00. Late in the evening, Krebs contacted General Alfred Jodl (Supreme Army Command) by radio: \\"Request immediate report. Firstly of the whereabouts of Wenck's spearheads. Secondly of time intended to attack. Thirdly of the location of the IX Army. Fourthly of the precise place in which the IX Army will break through. Fifthly of the whereabouts of General Rudolf Holste's spearhead.\\" In the early morning of 30 April, Jodl replied to Krebs: \\"Firstly, Wenck's spearhead bogged down south of Schwielow Lake. Secondly, XII Army therefore unable to continue attack on Berlin. Thirdly, bulk of IX Army surrounded. Fourthly, Holste's Corps on the defensive.\\" last paragraph, says Jodl replied, but , and , say it was Keitel Battle for the Reichstag By this time, several smaller Polish units had already taken part in the battle in Berlin (such as the 1st Polish Motorized Mortar Brigade, the 6th Polish Motorised Pontoon Battalion, and the 2nd Polish Howitzer Brigade). Soviet forces were lacking infantry support, and armored units, without infantry support, were taking heavy casualties. As of 30 April, the Soviet forces were joined by the Polish 1st Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko Infantry Division after a request from the Soviet command for infantry reinforcements. Originally, one infantry regiment was to support the 1st Mechanised Corps, and two, the 12th Guards Tank Corps; contrary to the original plan, two regiments (1st and 2nd) ended up supporting the 1st Corps, and only one (3rd) the 12th Corps. The 3rd Polish Infantry Regiment was operating with the 66th Guards Tank Brigade of the 12th Guards Tank Corps. The 1st Polish Infantry Regiment was split up into \\"combat teams\\" supporting the 19th and 35th Mechanized Brigades, with the 2nd Polish Infantry Regiment supporting the 219th Tank Brigade; all units of the Soviet 1st Mechanized Corps. Upon arrival, the Polish forces found that the Soviet units had suffered tremendous losses; the 19th and 35th Mechanized Brigades had sustained over 90% casualties, and thus the Polish 1st Infantry Regiment originally assigned to support them had to, in effect, take over their tasks. The 66th Guards Tank Brigade of the 12th Corps that received the 3rd Polish Infantry Regiment for support had similarly taken heavy losses, having already lost 82 tanks due to insufficient infantry cover. = Battle for the Reichstag = At 06:00 on 30 April the 150th Rifle Division had still not captured the upper floors of the Ministry of the Interior, but while the fighting was still going on, the 150th launched an attack from there across the 400 metres of K√∂nigsplatz towards the Reichstag. For the Soviets, the Reichstag was the symbol of the Third Reich; it was of such significant value that the Soviets wanted to capture it before the May Day parade in Moscow (ironically, it was never restored by the Nazis after the fire). The assault was not an easy one. The Germans had dug a complicated network of trenches around the building and a collapsed tunnel had filled with water from the Spree forming a moat across K√∂nigsplatz. The initial infantry assault was decimated by cross fire from the Reichstag and the Kroll Opera House on the western side of K√∂nigsplatz. By now the Spree had been bridged and the Soviets were able to bring up tanks and artillery to support fresh assaults by the infantry, some of which were tasked with out-flanking the Opera House and attacking it from the north-west. By 10:00 the soldiers of the 150th had reached the moat, but accurate fire from 12.8 cm FlaK 40 anti-aircraft guns, two kilometres away high on the flak tower close by the Berlin Zoo, prevented any further successful advance across the moat during daylight. Throughout the rest of the day, as ninety artillery pieces, some as large as the 203 mm howitzer, as well as Katyusha rocket launchers, bombarded the Reichstag and its defensive trenches. Colonel Negoda's 171st Rifle Division, on the left flank of the 150th, continued to capture the buildings of the diplomatic quarter to the north of K√∂nigsplatz., for the size of the AAA As the perimeter shrank and the surviving defenders fell back on the centre, they became concentrated. By now, there were about 10,000 soldiers in the city centre, who were being assaulted from all sides. One of the other main thrusts was along Wilhelmstrasse on which the Air Ministry building, which was built of reinforced concrete, was situated. It was pounded by large concentrations of Soviet artillery. The remaining German Tiger tanks of the Hermann von Salza battalion took up positions in the east of the Tiergarten to defend the centre against the 3rd Shock Army (which, although heavily engaged around the Reichstag, was also flanking the area by advancing through the northern Tiergarten) and the 8th Guards Army advancing through the south of the Tiergarten. These Soviet forces had effectively cut the sausage-shaped area held by the Germans in half and made an escape to the west for those German troops in the centre much more difficult. During the morning, Mohnke informed Hitler the centre would be able to hold for less than two days. Later that morning, Weidling informed Hitler in person that the defenders would probably exhaust their ammunition that night and again asked Hitler permission to break out. At about 13:00, Weidling, who was back in his headquarters in the Bendlerblock, finally received Hitler's permission to attempt a breakout. During the afternoon, Hitler shot himself and Braun took cyanide. In accordance with Hitler's instructions, the bodies were burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery. In accordance with Hitler's last will and testament, Joseph Goebbels, the Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, became the new \\"Head of Government\\" and Chancellor of Germany (Reichskanzler). At 3:15 am, Reichskanzler Goebbels and Bormann sent a radio message to Admiral D√∂nitz informing him of Hitler's death. Per Hitler's last wishes, D√∂nitz was appointed as the new \\"President of Germany\\" (Reichspr√§sident). Starting from 16:00 on 30 April, the 1st Battalion of the Polish 1st Regiment (assigned to the region of 35th Mechanized Brigade) begun an assault on a barricade on Pestalozzistrasse, a major obstacle which made previous tank attacks in that direction suicidal. The Polish 2nd and 3rd Regiments cleared the path through the barricades on Goethestrasse and Schillerstrasse for the tanks of the Soviet 19th Brigade. Polish flag raised on the top of Berlin Victory Column on 2 May 1945 Because of the smoke, dusk came early to the centre of Berlin. At 18:00 hours, while Weidling and his staff finalized their breakout plans in the Bendlerblock, three regiments of the Soviet 150th Rifle Division, under cover of a heavy artillery barrage and closely supported by tanks, assaulted the Reichstag. All the windows were bricked up, but the soldiers managed to force the main doors and entered the main hall. The German garrison, of about 1,000 defenders (a mixture of sailors, SS and Hitler Youth) fired down on the Soviets from above, turning the main hall into a medieval style killing field. Suffering many casualties, the Soviets got beyond the main hall and started to work their way up through the building. The fire and subsequent wartime damage had turned the building's interior into a maze of rubble and debris amongst which the German defenders were strongly dug in. The Soviet infantry were forced to clear them out. Fierce room-to-room fighting ensued. As May Day approached Soviet troops reached the roof, but fighting continued inside. Moscow claimed that they hoisted the Red Flag on the top of the Reichstag at 22:50, however Beevor points out that this may have been an exaggeration as \\"Soviet propaganda was fixated with the idea of the Reichstag being captured by 1 May\\". Whatever the truth, the fighting continued as there was still a large contingent of German soldiers down in the basement. The Germans were well stocked with food and ammunition and launched counter-attacks against the Red Army, leading to close fighting in and around the Reichstag. Close combat raged throughout the night and the coming day of 1 May, until the evening when some German troops pulled out of the building and crossed the Friedrichstra√üe S-Bahn Station, where they moved into the ruins hours before the main breakout across the Spree. About 300 of the last German combatants surrendered. A further 200 defenders were dead and another 500 were already hors de combat, lying wounded in the basement, many before the final assault had started. Capture of Charlottenburg  The barricade at Pestalozzistrasse was taken on the morning of 1 May, allowing Soviet tanks of the 34th Brigade to advance and to reestablish contact with the 19th Mechanized Brigade supported by the 2nd and 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment, which pushed through the barricades at Goethestrasse and Schillerstrasse. Further, heavily fortified German positions in and around the church at the Karl August-Platz were taken, allowing the Polish and Soviet units to advance along the Goethestrasse and Schillerstrasse. In the meantime, the Polish 2nd Regiment, with its own artillery support, took the heavily fortified Berlin Institute of Technology that was situated in the triangle between Charlottenburgerstrasse, Hardenbergstrasse and Jebenstrasse. With support by the Polish 3rd Infantry Regiment, the Soviet 66th Guards Tank Brigade (which had only 15 tanks) broke through Franklinstrasse and advanced towards the Berlin-Tiergarten station. The stronghold of the Tiergarten (S-Bahn) station was then secured by the 3rd Infantry Regiment. Thereafter, Polish and Soviet units took control of the Zoologischer Garten station and the railway line between them. By these actions, the Red Army had broken through the central Berlin west line of defence.  End of the battle  At about 04:00 on 1 May, Krebs talked to Chuikov, commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army., states 3am, and , 4am, for Krebs meeting with Chuikov Krebs returned empty-handed after refusing to agree to an unconditional surrender. Only Reichskanzler Goebbels now had the authority to agree to an unconditional surrender. In the late afternoon, Goebbels had his children poisoned. At about 20:00, Goebbels and his wife, Magda, left the bunker and close to the entrance bit on a cyanide ampoule, and either shot themselves at the same time or were given a coup de gr√¢ce immediately afterwards by the SS guard detailed to dispose of their bodies. As promised by the Soviets, at 10:45 on 1 May they unleashed a \\"hurricane of fire\\" on the German pocket in the centre to force the Germans to surrender unconditionally. For a brief period after Hitler's suicide, Goebbels was Germany's Reichskanzler. On 1 May, after Goebbels' own suicide, for an equally brief period, Reichspr√§sident Admiral Karl D√∂nitz appointed Ludwig von Krosigk as Reichskanzler. The headquarters of the D√∂nitz government were located around Flensburg, along with M√ºrwik, near the Danish border. Accordingly, the D√∂nitz administration was referred to as the Flensburg government. The commanders of two formidable Berlin fortresses agreed to surrender to the Soviets, so sparing both sides the losses involved in further bombardment and assault. The commander of the Zoo flak tower (that had proved impervious to direct hits from 203 mm howitzer shells) was asked to surrender on 30 April; after a long delay a message was sent back to the Soviets on 1 May informing them that the garrison would surrender to the Soviets at midnight that night. The reason for the delay was because the garrison intended to join in the attempt at a breakout. The other fortress was the Spandau Citadel of Trace italienne design which although several hundred years old presented a difficult structure to storm. After negotiations, the citadel's commander surrendered to Lieutenant-General F. I. Perkhorovitch's 47th Army just after 15:00 on 1 May. = Breakout = Weidendammer bridge in 2006 Weidling had given the order for the survivors to break out to the north-west starting at around 21:00 hours on 1 May., says that Weidling gave no orders for a breakout. The breakout started later than planned at around 23:00 hours. The first group from the Reich Chancellery was led by Mohnke. Bormann, Werner Naumann, and remaining F√ºhrerbunker personnel followed. Burgdorf, who played a key role in the death of Erwin Rommel, along with Krebs, committed suicide. Mohnke's group avoided the Weidendammer Bridge (over which the mass breakout took place) and crossed by a footbridge, but his group became split. A Tiger tank that spearheaded the first attempt to storm the Weidendammer Bridge was destroyed.Weidendammer Br√ºcke de.wikipedia.org There followed two more attempts and on the third attempt, made around 1:00, Bormann and SS doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger in another group from the Reich Chancellery managed to cross the Spree. They were reported to have died a short distance from the bridge, their bodies seen and identified by Arthur Axmann who followed the same route. Charlotten bridge. Rebuilt in 1926, it survived World War II. Krukenberg and many of the survivors of the remnants of the Nordland Division crossed the Spree shortly before dawn but could not break through and were forced back into the centre. There they split up; some discarded their uniforms and tried to pass themselves off as civilians, but most were either killed or, like Krukenberg, captured. An attempt to break out northward along the Sch√∂nhauser Allee by German troops on the north-eastern side of the central defence area failed because the Soviets were now aware that breakout attempts were being made and were hurriedly putting cordons in place to stop them. The remnants of the M√ºnchenberg Division (five tanks, four artillery pieces, and a handful of troops) and the remnants of the 18th Panzer Grenadier and 9th Parachute divisions broke out of the centre westward through the Tiergarten. They were followed by thousands of stragglers and civilians. Spandau was still in the hands of a Hitler Youth detachment, so an attempt was made to force a passage across the Charlottenbr√ºcke (Charlotten bridge) over the Havel. Despite heavy shelling which killed many, German weight of numbers meant that they were able to drive the Soviet infantry back and many thousands crossed into Spandau. The armoured vehicles that crossed the bridge made for Staaken. Mohnke (and what was left of his group) could not break through the Soviet rings. Most were taken prisoner and some committed suicide. General Mohnke and the others who had been in the F√ºhrerbunker were interrogated by SMERSH. Only a handful of survivors reached the Elbe and surrendered to the Western Allies. The majority were killed or captured by the Soviets. The number of German soldiers and civilians killed attempting the breakout is unknown. = Capitulation = On the morning of 2 May, the Soviets stormed the Reich Chancellery. In the official Soviet version, the battle was similar to that of the battle for the Reichstag. There was an assault over Wilhelmplatz and into the building with a howitzer to blast open the front doors and several battles within the building. Major Anna Nikulina, a political officer with Lieutenant-General I. P. Rossly's 9th Rifle Corps of the 5th Shock Army carried and unfurled the red flag on the roof. However, Beevor suggests that the official Soviet description is probably an exaggeration, as most of the German combat troops had left in the breakouts the night before, and resistance must have been far less than that inside the Reichstag. At 01:00 hours, the Soviets picked up radio message from the German LVI Corps requesting a cease-fire and stating that emissaries would come under a white flag to Potsdamer bridge. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 06:00 hours. He was taken to see Lieutenant-General Chuikov at 8:23 am. Chuikov, who had commanded the successful defence of Stalingrad, asked: \\"You are the commander of the Berlin garrison?\\" Weidling replied: \\"Yes, I am the commander of the LVI Panzer Corps.\\" Chuikov then asked: \\"Where is Krebs? What did he say?\\" Weidling replied: \\"I saw him yesterday in the Reich Chancellery.\\" Weidling then added: \\"I thought he would commit suicide.\\" In the discussions that followed, Weidling agreed to an unconditional surrender of the city of Berlin. He agreed to order the city's defenders to surrender to the Soviets. Under the direction of Chuikov and Soviet General Vasily Sokolovsky (Chief of staff of the 1st Ukrainian Front), Weidling put his order to surrender in writing. The 350-strong garrison of the Zoo flak tower finally left the building. There was sporadic fighting in a few isolated buildings where some SS still refused to surrender. The Soviets simply blasted any such building to rubble. Most Germans, soldiers and civilians, were grateful to receive food issued at Red Army soup kitchens. The Soviets went house to house and rounded up anyone in a uniform including firemen and railwaymen, a total of 180,000 and marched them eastwards as prisoners of war.  Aftermath  The Red Army made a major effort to feed the residents of the city which began on Colonel- General Nikolai Berzarin's orders. However, in many areas, vengeful Soviet troops (usually rear echelon units) looted, raped (an estimated 100,000) and murdered civilians for several weeks.Beevor, Antony; \\"They raped every German female from eight to 80\\" 1 May, The Guardian, 2002  See also  * End of World War II in Europe * German Instrument of Surrender * Race to Berlin  Notes References  * *  Further reading  *, Appendix 1: Soviet Order of Battle for the Battle for Berlin and Appendix 2: German Order of Battle for Operation Berlin), cites * * .

Background In June 1987, Willy Goltz was charged and convicted under s. 88(1) of the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act. He had been driving with a suspended licence. At the BC provincial court, Goltz was convicted. It was argued that the provision violated the right against cruel and unusual punishment, but was rejected.

Background Bred by Gardiner Farms in Caledon, Ontario, Runaway Groom was sired by the prominent Nearco descendant Blushing Groom out of the mare Yonnie Girl. He was purchased as a yearling at the Fasig-Tipton sale in Kentucky by New Yorker Albert J. Coppola,http://www.ntra.com/stats_bios.aspx?id=3478 who only realized later that the colt's birthplace meant he qualified for the Canadian Triple Crown series. Racing career Runaway Groom did not race at age two. Trained by New Yorker John DiMario, he began his career in the spring of 1982 at age three. Racing in Kentucky, he won two of his first four races, then was sent to Toronto's Woodbine Racetrack for the Queen's Plate, the most prestigious race in Canada and the first leg of the Canadian Triple Crown series. Under jockey Robin Platts, the lightly regarded Runaway Groom surprised fans and bettors as he finished a solid second behind Son of Briartic. In the ensuing Prince of Wales Stakes, Runaway Groom turned the tables on the Plate winner, winning it as well as the third leg of the Triple Crown, the Breeders' Stakes. Brought to New York to compete, Runaway Groom won an allowance race at Belmont Park before competing in Saratoga Race Course's premier event, the Grade I Travers Stakes. In a very strong field, bettors sent the colt off at 13-1 odds but under Canadian jockey Jeffrey Fell, Runaway Groom won the race, marking the second time in American racing history that a horse has beaten the Kentucky Derby winner (Gato Del Sol), the Preakness Stakes winner (Aloma's Ruler), and the Belmont Stakes winner (Conquistador Cielo) in the same race. The first took place when Sun Briar defeated Kentucky Derby winner (Exterminator), Preakness Stakes winner (War Cloud), and Belmont Stakes winner (Johren) in the 1918 Travers. For his 1982 performances, Runaway Groom earned Canadian Champion 3-Yr-Old- Colt honors. When he raced at age four in California, his conditioning was taken over by Charles Whittingham. His best graded stakes race result before he retired to stud duty was a third in the 1983 San Diego Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack. Stud record Sent to the Vinery breeding farm in Lexington, Kentucky, Runaway Groom had a long and successful stud career. He sired a number of Graded stakes race winners, including Cherokee Run (who won the 1994 Breeders' Cup Sprint), 2006 Sunshine Millions Oaks and 2007 Sunshine Millions Distaff winner Joint Effort, Japanese runner Machikane Hokushin, and multiple-stakes-winning millionaires Down The Aisle and Wekiva Springs. In 2001, Runaway Groom was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.http://www.canadianhorseracinghalloffame.com/thoroughbred/2001/Runaway_Groom.asp Runaway Groom at the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame In February 2007, the 28-year-old horse was pensioned from stud duty, having sired sixty stakes race winners and twenty-seven graded stakes winners. On June 8, 2007, Runaway Groom was humanely euthanized due to the infirmities of old age.

He was the proteg√© of Wolfram von Soden, and served out his life as Professor Ordenarius in the Seminar f√ºr Keilschriftforschung (Seminar for Cuneiform Studies) at the University of G√∂ttingen, Germany. Most famous for his cuneiform sign lists, Borger also published the important work Handbuch der Keilschriftliteratur, a detailed overview of all the published books and articles related to Assyriology that were available at the time. Up until his death, Borger was working on an updated version. His self-study method for Akkadian script and language, Babylonisch-Assyrische Lesest√ºcke is, despite its age (1963), still being used and reprinted.https://www.eisenbrauns.com/assets/catalogs/Eisenbrauns_ANE_2007.pdf Rykle Borger had been the assistant to Wolfram von Soden during the latter's work on Das Akkadische Handw√∂rterbuch (AHW), one of the foundational works of modern Assyriological philology. This experience led Borger to think of himself as a foundational philologist, and his lifelong commitment was to creating detailed and accurate reference works to support and advance the discipline of Assyriology. At G√∂ttingen, Borger trained a number of notable students, Professors Stefan Maul (University of Heidelberg),http://www.uni- heidelberg.de/fakultaeten/philosophie/ori/assyriologie/mitarbeiter/maul.html and Andreas Fuchs (University of T√ºbingen),http://www.uni- tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/philosophische-fakultaet/fachbereiche/altertums-und- kunstwissenschaften/ianes/mitarbeiterinnen/altorientalische-philologie/fuchs- andreas-apl-prof-dr.html among them. An American student, Dr. Donald G. Schley, contributed to Prof. M.E.J. Richardson's (University of Manchester) production of the English edition of the Koehler-Baumgartner Hebrew-Aramaic Lexikon of the Old Testament (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1994). At Borger's behest, Schley also translated Wolfram von Soden's Einf√ºhrung in die Altorientalistik into English (The Ancient Orient: An Introduction to the Study of the Ancient Near East; Eerdmans, 1994)--the only contribution of Borger's mentor available in English. Thus, Borger sought to further foundational philological work among his students and to support the distribution of the work of his mentor, von Soden. Wilfred Lambert of the University of Birmingham, author of the notable anthology, Babylonian Wisdom Literature (1960), and one of the leading cuneiform experts in the world, was a close associate and collaborator of Borger's. Rykle Borger was never able to complete his one great ambition‚Äîthe creation of a Sumero-Akkadian Lexikon based solely on the ancient Mesopotamian bilingual texts. Yet he was an indefatigable scholar of ancient Mesopotamian and Semitic languages, and did produce foundational works necessary for the advance of Assyriology as a discipline.

The UTZ label is featured on more than 10,000 product packages in over 116 countries. From 2014, UTZ is the largest program for sustainable farming of coffee and cocoa in the world. The UTZ program comprises a reasonable handling of agricultural practices, social and living conditions, farm management, and the environment. In January 2018, UTZ officially merged with the Rainforest Alliance in response to the increasing challenges of deforestation, climate change, systemic poverty, and social inequity. History UTZ was launched in 2002 as Utz Kapeh, meaning 'Good Coffee' in the Mayan language Quich√©. It was founded by Nick Bocklandt, a Belgian- Guatemalan coffee grower, and Ward de Groote, a Dutch coffee roaster, with the goal of implementing sustainability on a large scale in the worldwide market. The Solidaridad Network was another co-initiator of UTZ and assisted UTZ in becoming a global standard through financial support and field implementation. On 7 March 2007, the Utz Kapeh Foundation officially changed its name and logo to UTZ Certified and, on 1 January 2016, shortened their name to UTZ. In June 2017, the Rainforest Alliance and UTZ announced the intention to merge, and in January 2018, the merger was legally closed and completed. The merged organization goes by the name Rainforest Alliance. The new Rainforest Alliance plans to release a new certification standard in 2019; until then the two organizations' programs run in parallel. Products=Coffee UTZ is the largest sustainability program in the world for coffee. In 2012, 9% of the coffee produced in the world was UTZ certified (716,000 T (Metric Ton= 1000 kg), out of global production of 8,200,000 TSSI Review, p 176.). Cocoa A Swiss chocolate bar with the \\"UTZ Certified\\" label On 10 October 2007, the Cocoa Program was launched. UTZ cooperated with Ahold, Cargill, Heinz Benelux, Mars, Nestl√©, and ECOM Agroindustrial to set up a new certification and traceability system for sustainable cocoa. Solidaridad and Oxfam Novib also supported the initiative from the beginning. In 2009 the first UTZ cocoa products reached the market. As of 2014, UTZ became the largest sustainability program for cocoa in the world, and over 336,300 cocoa farmers from 16 countries were affiliated with UTZ. In 2012, 13% of the cocoa produced in the world was UTZ (535,000 T, out of global production of 2,889,000 TSSI Review, p 146.). By 2017, Utz was certifying \\"1.5 million tons of cocoa, or about two- thirds of the world's supply of certified cocoa.\\" In 2019, \\"significant problems\\" had emerged with respect to with four of the auditing organizations working in the Ivory Coast. Tea The UTZ program for tea and rooibos was launched in 2007. Hazelnuts UTZ launched its hazelnut program in 2014 to explore the possibilities for sustainability in this sector as well. The program was originally piloted in Turkey, but since then it has gone global and expanded to Georgia, Azerbaijan, Italy, Spain, and other countries. Code of Conduct=Summary The UTZ certification program is based on the UTZ Code of Conduct: a set of social and environmental criteria for responsible growing practices and efficient farm management. Coffee, cocoa and tea producers who are UTZ certified comply with this code. The Code of Conduct version 2014 is based on the international ILO Conventions and the expertise of many stakeholders, including the farmers who use it. The Code has been developed in a broad stakeholder process and therefore widely accepted. A core code is applicable to all farmers, and there are also additional requirements in product specific modules for coffee, cocoa and tea. The certification system is based on a model of continuous improvement. Producers have to comply with core safety and quality standards from year one. Additional control points are added in the following years. Categories The criteria of the UTZ Code of Conduct fall into four categories: =Farm management= *Measures to optimize the yield *Internal Management System for groups, with responsibilities including: **Arranging annual internal inspections *Record keeping *Risk assessments *Training and awareness raising *Recording of volumes in the UTZ traceability system =Farming practices= *Choice of suitable planting variety *Farm maintenance *Soil fertility management *Diversification of production, to support ecological diversity and economic resilience *Integrated pest management *Responsible and appropriate choice and use of agro-chemicals and fertilizers, and records of application *Irrigation *Product handling during and after the harvest =Social and living conditions= *Application of national laws and ILO conventions regarding wages and working hours, including the living wage concept for individual farms *No forced labor or child labour *Freedom of association and collective bargaining *Safe and healthy working conditions, including: **Protective clothing for work with chemicals **Safety training of workers in their own language *Gender equality *No discrimination *Freedom of cultural expression *Access to education for children *Access to decent housing, clean drinking water, and health care for workers and their families =Environment= *Efficient use of water and energy *Waste management *Promotion of ecological diversity *Protection of nature *No deforestation of primary forests *Respect for protected areas *Protection of endangered species *Reduction and prevention of soil erosion *Measures to adapt to climate change Product- Specific modulesCoffee= *Correct fermentation and handling of coffee after harvest *Treatment of waste water from processing =Cocoa= *Use of shade trees *Correct drying and fermentation =Tea= *Harvest carried out at the appropriate time *Correct handling of harvested leaves *Quality control *Energy and waste water management =Rooibos= *Crop rotation *Harvest carried out at the appropriate time *Correct post-harvest handling *Bush fire prevention *Identification and protection of wild rooibos areas Chain of custody To enhance the guarantee that a consumer product with an UTZ logo does indeed credibly link to an UTZ certified producer, the UTZ program contains chain of custody requirements. This is a set of chain- wide administrative, logistical and technical requirements for traceability. These requirements include criteria for separation of UTZ-certified products and conventional non-UTZ-certified products, and keeping records of direct suppliers and buyers. Traceability UTZ certified coffee, cocoa and tea is traceable through the supply chain, as UTZ uses a web-based traceability system. When an UTZ certified producer sells their products (e.g. coffee, cocoa, tea) to a registered UTZ buyer, the product is announced in the UTZ web-based system. By doing so the seller announces when they are shipping what amount to whom. The buyer then gets notified and needs to confirm this in the traceability system. UTZ assigns a unique tracking number to this lot. At the end of the supply chain, the end product manufacturer uses the unique tracking number to know their product credibly links to a certified source. Some brands use this unique tracking system to make the product traceable for their consumers. =Traceability Services= Traceability services UTZ has developed, implemented and is currently managing the traceability system for the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. This system was launched in December 2008. Certification Independent, third party auditors make annual inspections to ensure coffee producers comply with the Code of Conduct. =Certification body= A certification body (CB) is an independent, third- party certifier. When approved by UTZ Certified, these organizations conduct annual certification inspections of coffee, cocoa and tea producers to determine whether they comply with the UTZ Certified Code of Conduct and Chain of Custody requirements. =Trained agronomists= An UTZ-trained agronomist is a technical consultant specifically trained in assisting producers to comply with the UTZ Code of Conduct. Trained agronomists can advise on practical implementation of elements of the Code and give directions on improvement of efficiency in farm management. Impact In 2014, UTZ published its first impact report. This brought together 24 external studies and data collected by UTZ. It stated that UTZ cocoa, coffee and tea farms generate higher yields and better quality crops than conventional farms, and being trained in the UTZ Code of Conduct helps farmers to improve their knowledge and adopt sustainable farming practices. There are no independent scientific studies that prove positive effects of UTZ. Pricing Coffee, cocoa and tea with an UTZ certification has added value in the sense that it assures buyers that it has been produced according to an internationally recognized standard for responsible production, i.e. according to the UTZ Code of Conduct. The price for UTZ certified coffee is determined in the negotiation process between buyer and seller. UTZ does not interfere in price negotiations. In contrast to fair trade, no minimum purchase price is set. Instead, the focus on good agricultural practices in the UTZ program is intended to enable farmers to increase the quantity and quality of their yield, and thus to increase their income. Criticism UTZ certification, like the Rainforest Alliance coffee certification program, has been criticized because it offers producers no minimum or guaranteed price for their crop. Some consider UTZ certified producer organizations to be vulnerable to the volatility of the coffee market. Michael Conroy, an independent consultant on certification for sustainable development, criticized UTZ in his 2007 book Branded!: \\"the environmental standards of UTZ Certified are far weaker than those of either Fairtrade or Rainforest Alliance\\". UTZ's standards for example, explicitly announces that genetically modified coffee plants, though not at present available, would be allowable so long as farmers obey local regulations on their use. Any kind of chemical fertilizer may be used as long as an external, technically qualified advisor has determined the quantity of fertilizer to be used. No chemical pesticides or fungicides banned in the European Union, the U.S., or Japan may be used, but any that are acceptable in those three markets are acceptable on coffee farms if they are applied \\"according to the label\\".Conroy, Branded!, p 252. In July 2012, German magazine \\"√ñkotest\\" published an article labeling UTZ, among others, as unfair, due to a lack of pre-financing and guaranteed minimum purchase prices. In response UTZ stated that the foundation does not consider its standards fair trade, nor that it claims that they are, while maintaining that its standards contribute positively to sustainable development of tropical farming communities. In October 2019, the Washington Post reported that UTZ certified cocoa farms were actually more likely to employ child labor than farms without the certification. Additionally, a spokesperson confirmed reports that more than 4,900 UTZ-certified farms were illegally located within national forests. UTZ identified four independent auditing firms it contracts with as the source of most of the flawed certifications.

The museum houses exhibits containing assortments of telegraphs, radios, radars and satellites. Located near the Baltimore Washington International Airport and rail station, the museum displays hands-on electronics. The library serves as a research center open to the public. In addition, an amateur radio station is broadcast live from the museum each week. K3NEM/W3GR includes both antique and updated communication equipment.  History  The National Electronics Museum was created by Westinghouse employees. Robert L. Dwight, who worked for the Westinghouse Defense and Electronics Systems Center located in Baltimore, MD, jump-started the current collection in 1973 by conducting a \\"Family Day\\" to display his colleagues' work while involving their families. Titled \\"Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow\\", the exhibit showed examples of past and present Westinghouse work to represent the company's progress through the eras. Dwight then decided to pursue more radar systems and other electronics for viewing. His first mission, taken on with the help of Jack Sun, a former U.S. Air Force officer and Westinghouse employee, was to acquire the BOMARC missile radar from the Department of Defense. This missile housed the first airborne pulse-doppler radar, AN/DPN-53. However, in order to gain access to the radar they had to be classified as a non-profit museum. After gaining advice and paperwork from Westinghouse lawyer, Butch Gregory, they founded the National Electronics Museum in 1980. Finances and storage space were handled by Westinghouse, and in 1983 a (2,000 sq-ft) portion of space was devoted to the museum at the Airport Square III. Then, in 1986 the space was extended to (4,000 sq-ft). Formerly run by volunteers, the museum hired its first professional employee in 1989 and subsequently relocated to Friendship square in 1992. In 1996, Northrop Grumman bought Westinghouse and continued support for museum efforts. The museum closed its doors temporarily when it underwent construction in 1999 and reopened with over (22,000 sq-ft) of space. This space included a conference room, event hall, gallery, and a climate- controlled warehouse. The museum offers education programs such as YESS (Young Engineers and Scientists) and the annual Robot Fest (held annually on the last weekend of April), as well as the Robert L. Dwight scholarship. Donations and grants are accepted from foundations and engineering societies. Board members include former Westinghouse employees and Northrop Grumman associates. Other public foundations such as Anne Arundel County Public Schools, Camegie Institute, American Alliance of Museums, the University of Maryland ‚Äì Baltimore County, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, Allied Signal, and Hertzbach & Company support the museum. Over 30 volunteers donate over 5,000 hours of their time each year.  Galleries  The National Electronics Museum is organized into twelve related exhibit galleries: : *Fundamentals Gallery- Focuses on the basics of electricity and electronics as well as early electronics *Communications Gallery- From the telegraph to modern computers, this gallery focuses on a wide range of communication devices, including Ham Radio and the Enigma Machine. *Early Radar Gallery- Radar from World War II, to the include the actual SCR-270 unit used at the Opana Radar Site on December 7, 1941. *Cold War Radar Gallery- The Cold War advanced technology in many areas, including radar. *Modern Radar Gallery- Radar has continued to develop, as is shown in this gallery *Countermeasures Gallery- As Radar has developed, so have ways to hide from it, including jammers, receivers, and transmitters. *Under Seas Gallery ‚Äì Focuses on SONAR as well as other underwater technology *Electro-optical Gallery ‚Äì Focuses on the basics of infrared versus visual and the applications of infrared and Electro-optical technology *Space Sensor Gallery ‚Äì From satellites to the cameras used on the moon, this gallery looks at the technologies that have been used outside our planet *Temporary Gallery ‚Äì The museum has gallery space that changes regularly.

Assisted suicide/assisted death is legal in Washington, D.C. and the states of California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont, Maine, New Jersey, Hawaii, and Washington; its status is disputed in Montana, though currently authorized per the Montana Supreme Court's ruling in Baxter v. Montana that \\"nothing in Montana Supreme Court precedent or Montana statutes [indicates] that physician aid in dying is against public policy.\\" The key difference between euthanasia and assisted suicide is that in cases of assisted suicide, the individual receives assistance, but ultimately voluntarily causes their own death. In euthanasia the individual does not directly end their life, but another person acts to cause the individual's death. Early history Debates about the ethics of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide date from ancient Greece and Rome. After the development of ether, physicians began advocating the use of anesthetics to relieve the pain of death. In 1870, Samuel Williams first proposed using anesthetics and morphine to intentionally end a patient's life. Over the next 35 years, debates about euthanasia raged in the United States which resulted in an Ohio bill to legalize euthanasia in 1906, a bill that was ultimately defeated. Euthanasia advocacy in the U.S. peaked again during the 1930s and diminished significantly during and after World War II. Euthanasia efforts were revived during the 1960s and 1970s, under the right-to-die rubric, physician assisted death in liberal bioethics, and through advance directives and do not resuscitate orders. Several major court cases advanced the legal rights of patients, or their guardians, to practice at least voluntary passive euthanasia (physician assisted death). These include the Karen Ann Quinlan case (1976), Brophy and Nancy Cruzan cases. More recent years have seen policies fine-tuned and re-stated, as with Washington v. Glucksberg (1997) and the Terri Schiavo case. The numerous legislative rulings and legal precedents that were brought about in the wake of the Quinlan case had their ethical foundation in the famous 1983 report completed by the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine, under the title \\"Deciding to Forgo Life-Sustaining Treatment.\\"Angell, Marcia. \\"How to Die in Massachusetts.\\" The New York Review of Books. 21 February 2013: 60.3. Web. 14 Jul. 2014. The Commission sustained in its findings that it was morally acceptable to give up a life-supporting therapy and that withholding or withdrawing such a therapy is the same thing from an ethical stand-point, while artificial feeding and other life-supporting therapy are of the same importance for the patients and doctors. Before this report, to withdraw a medical therapy was regarded as much more serious decision than not to start a therapy at all, while artificial feeding was viewed as a special treatment. By 1990, barely a decade and a half after the New Jersey Supreme Court‚Äôs historic decision, patients were well aware that they could decline any form of medical therapy if they simply choose to do that either directly or by expressing their wish via appointed representative. In a 2004 article in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine, Brown University historian Jacob M. Appel documented extensive political debate over legislation to legalize physician-assisted suicide in both Iowa and Ohio in 1906. The driving force behind this movement was social activist Anna S. Hall. Canadian historian Ian Dowbiggen's 2003 book, A Merciful End, revealed the role that leading public figures, including Clarence Darrow and Jack London, played in advocating for the legalization of euthanasia. Legislation and political movements=California In the 1983 case of Barber v. Superior Court, two physicians had honored a family's request to withdraw both respirator and intravenous feeding and hydration tubes from a comatose patient. The physicians were charged with murder, despite the fact that they were doing what the family wanted. The court held that all charges should be dropped because the treatments had all been ineffective and burdensome. Withdrawal of treatment, even if life-ending, is morally and legally permitted. Competent patients or their surrogates can decide to withdraw treatments, usually after the treatments are found ineffective, painful, or burdensome. Maine From 1 January 2020 - Maine becomes the 8th US state to legalize assisted dying. In June 2019, the Maine Legislature by a very close vote passed a bill to legalize assisted dying. The Governor of Maine signed the bill into law within the same month. New Jersey In the United States legal and ethical debates about euthanasia became more prominent in the Karen Ann Quinlan case who went into a coma after allegedly mixing tranquilizers with alcohol, surviving biologically for 9 years in a \\"persistent vegetative state\\" even after the New Jersey Supreme Court approval to remove her from a respirator. This case caused a widespread public concern about \\"lives not worth living\\" and the possibility of at least voluntary euthanasia if it could be ascertained that the patient would not have wanted to live in this condition. In April 2019, New Jersey became the 7th US state to allow assisted dying after the Governor of New Jersey signed the bill into law and went into effect since August 1, 2019. Texas In 1999, the state of Texas passed the Advance Directives Act. Under the law, in some situations, Texas hospitals and physicians have the right to withdraw life support measures, such as mechanical respiration, from terminally ill patients when such treatment is considered to be both futile and inappropriate. This is sometimes referred to as \\"passive euthanasia\\". In 2005, a six-month-old infant, Sun Hudson, with a uniformly fatal disease thanatophoric dysplasia, was the first patient in which \\"a United States court has allowed life-sustaining treatment to be withdrawn from a pediatric patient over the objections of the child's parent\\".  Massachusetts  Currently, euthanasia is illegal in Massachusetts. According to Ch. 201D ¬ß12 Massachusetts states that \\"Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to constitute, condone, authorize, or approve suicide or mercy killing or to permit any affirmative or deliberate act to end one's own life other than to permit the natural process of dying\\". Even though euthanasia as well as physician assisted suicide is not legal in Massachusetts, the Supreme court ruled in 1997 to not allow euthanasia or physician assisted suicide, but to give the freedom to the patient to refuse life supporting medical care by making these two laws different from one another. So now although there is no euthanasia in Massachusetts, one is allowed to refuse artificial life support measures. Unsuccessful initiatives Attempts to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide resulted in ballot initiatives and legislation bills within the United States in the last 20 years. For example, Washington voters saw Ballot Initiative 119 in 1991, California placed Proposition 161 on the ballot in 1992, Oregon passed the Death with Dignity Act in 1994, and Michigan included Proposal B in their ballot in 1998. U.S. public opinion on euthanasia Reflecting the religious and cultural diversity of the United States, there is a wide range of public opinion about euthanasia and the right-to-die movement in the United States. During the past 30 years, public research shows that views on euthanasia tend to correlate with religious affiliation and culture, though not gender. Opinion by religious affiliation In one recent study dealing primarily with Christian denominations such as Southern Baptists, Pentecostals, and Evangelicals and Catholics tended to be opposed to euthanasia. Moderate Protestants, (e.g., Lutherans and Methodists) showed mixed views concerning end of life decisions in general. Both of these groups showed less support than non-affiliates, but were less opposed to it than conservative Protestants. Respondents that did not affiliate with a religion were found to support euthanasia more than those who did. The liberal Protestants (including some Presbyterians and Episcopalians) were the most supportive. In general, liberal Protestants affiliate more loosely with religious institutions and their views were not similar to those of non-affiliates. Within all groups, religiosity (i.e., self-evaluation and frequency of church attendance) also correlated to opinions on euthanasia. Individuals who attended church regularly and more frequently and considered themselves more religious were found to be more opposed to euthanasia than to those who had a lower level of religiosity.Burdette, Amy M; Hill, Terrence D; Moulton, Benjamin E. Religion and Attitudes toward Physician-Assisted Suicide and Terminal Palliative Care\\" Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 2005, 44, 1, Mar, 79‚Äì93. Opinion by race and gender Recent studies have shown white Americans to be more accepting of euthanasia than black Americans. They are also more likely to have advance directives and to use other end-of-life measures.Werth Jr., James L.; Blevins, Dean; Toussaint, Karine L.; Durham, Martha R. \\"The influence of cultural diversity on end-of-life care and decisions.\\" The American Behavioral Scientist; Oct 2002; 46, 2; pp. 204‚Äì219. African Americans are almost 3 times more likely to oppose euthanasia than white Americans. Some speculate that this discrepancy is due to the lower levels of trust in the medical establishment.Jennings, Patricia K., Talley, Clarence R. \\"A Good Death?: White Privilege and Public Opinion.\\" Race, Gender, & Class. New Orleans: Jul 31, 2003. Vol. 10, Iss. 3; p. 42. Select researchers believe that historical medical abuses towards minorities (such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study) have made minority groups less trustful of the level of care they receive. One study also found that there are significant disparities in the medical treatment and pain management that white Americans and other Americans receive.Werth Jr., James L.; Blevins, Dean; Toussaint, Karine L.; Durham, Martha R. \\"The influence of cultural diversity on end-of-life care and decisions.\\" The American Behavioral Scientist; Oct 2002; 46, 2; pp. 204‚Äì219 Among African Americans, education correlates to support for euthanasia. Black Americans without a four-year degree are twice as likely to oppose euthanasia than those with at least that much education. Level of education, however, does not significantly influence other racial groups in the US. Some researchers suggest that African Americans tend to be more religious, a claim that is difficult to substantiate and define. Only black and white Americans have been studied in extensive detail. Although it has been found that minority groups are less supportive of euthanasia than white Americans, there is still some ambiguity as to what degree this is true. A 2005 Gallup Poll found that 84% of males supported euthanasia compared to 64% of females.Moore, D. (2005 May 17). \\"Three in Four Americans Support Euthanasia.\\" The Gallup Organization. Some cite the prior studies showing that women have a higher level of religiosity and moral conservatism as an explanation for major opposition to euthanasia. Within both sexes, there are differences in attitudes towards euthanasia due to other influences. For example, one study found that black American women are 2.37 times more likely to oppose euthanasia than white American women. African American men are 3.61 times more likely to oppose euthanasia than white American men.Jennings, Patricia K., Talley, Clarence R. \\"A Good Death?: White Privilege and Public Opinion.\\" Race, Gender, & Class. New Orleans: Jul 31, 2003. Vol. 10, Iss. 3; p. 42. the public opinion In \\"Gender, Feminism, and Death: Physician-Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia\\" Susan M. Wolf warns of the gender disparities if euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide were legal. Wolf highlights four possible gender effects: higher incidence of women than men dying by physician-assisted suicide; more women seeking physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia for different reasons than men; physicians granting or refusing requests for assisted suicide or euthanasia because of the gender of the patient; gender affecting the broad public debate by envisioning a woman patient when considering the debate.

Description The company produces a variety of hi-fi products, such as amplifiers, receivers, car audio equipment and LCD TVs, but is best known for its Loudspeakers. History Rogers was founded by Jim Rogers in 1947. An early example was the Rogers Theatrical Horn Loudspeaker. In the early 1970s, Rogers was commissioned by the BBC to produce the LS3/5A. Some 50,000 pairs have been built worldwide to date. Meanwhile, LS 5/8 and LS 5/9 studio monitors were manufactured under licence from the BBC, and have been used in recording studios worldwide. In 1975 Michael O'Brien as chairman and Brian Pook as M.D. buy Rogers from the receiver. To do this Michael O'Brien bought an off the shelf trading company called Swisstone. Swisstone, trading as Rogers, with 6 former employees retain the BBC licence for the LS3/5A and start manufacturing. Later in 1978 Rogers (actually Swisstone because Rogers now wasn't a company but a trading name) under Michael O'Brien and Brian Pook buy Chartwell from the official receiver. In 1993 the brand was sold off to its new Chinese owners Wo Kee Hong Holdings, who had since developed the Rogers brand to include surround sound speakers, car audio equipment, Dolby Digital receivers and plasma and LCD TV screens. Although Wo Kee Hong owns the rights to the name, it had retained Swisstone as the sole researcher and designers of the Rogers speakers, therefore preserving the brand's British origins for a while. In 1998 as a result of a dramatic downturn in its Asian exports, the company closed the last of its UK manufacturing sites, and moved all production to Asia, where it has resided since.in 2018 Rogers back to UK.

Products Versions of the Rogers LS3/5A on display in a second-hand shop LS3/5A In the early 1970s, the BBC was in need of a small monitor speaker for use in restricted areas outside broadcast vans during location recording. To that end, they commissioned their Research Department to develop such a compact speaker, and an experimental loudspeaker developed during preliminary work on acoustic scaling provided the basis for the LS3/5A. The outcome was then licensed to commercial speaker companies for production. Aside from Rogers, other manufacturers licensed by the BBC to produce the LS3/5a included Chartwell, Audiomaster, Spendor, and Harbeth. The LS3/5A was Rogers' most successful loudspeaker, and to date 50,000 pairs have been built worldwide. Other hi-fi products During the 1980s, Rogers made the A75 and A100 amplifiers and the T100 FM tuner. Rogers also produced a pair of active subwoofers, called LS3/5B, which were designed specifically for the LS3/5As. The subwoofers were sold complete with their own electronic crossover, which used the same chassis as the A75/A100 amplifiers. LS 5/8 and 5/9 These studio speakers were manufactured by Rogers under licenses granted by the BBC, and have been installed in many recording studios. \\"JR149\\" Jim Rogers, who set up J R Loudspeakers Ltd after the collapse of Rogers Audio, released the JR149 in 1977 using the same drive units as the LS3/5A in a cylindrical aluminium cabinet.

This triggered a trap set by some politicians, drug dealers, and journalists who were threatened by the explosive growth of Lara in government and especially in the fight against drug trafficking. Jairo Ortega, Escobar's ally in Congress, presented a check (eventually shown to have been falsified) to the chamber, supposedly drawn by known drug trafficker Evaristo Porras. This, in addition to a recorded conversation between Lara and Porras, caused many to question Lara's legitimacy. President Betancur, however, dismissed the allegations and retained Lara in office. After the alleged link between Lara and the drug cartels was discredited, the government began uncovering the shadowy dealings of the Medell√≠n Cartel, specifically Escobar. Escobar was expelled from the Congress and his U.S. visa cancelled. The Minister went further, reviving criminal charges against Escobar and other drug lords, such as Carlos Lehder. Lara also ordered the seizure of hundreds of planes and properties that were allegedly used for the production and distribution of illegal substances. While Congress debated approving an extradition treaty with the United States, Escobar and his allies sought to solve their problems by physically eliminating Lara.  Murder  Assassination of Lara Only eight months after taking the Ministry of Justice post, Lara was gunned down in his white 1976 Mercedes-Benz W123 on the night of April 30, 1984, on 127th Street in Bogota, which later was named \\"Avenida Rodrigo Lara Bonilla\\" in his honor. The murder occurred at the hands of an assassin sent by Escobar, named Ivan Dario Guisado, who rode on a Yamaha DT175 motorcycle driven by Byron Velasquez, aka \\"Quesito\\". Guisado was killed by the minister's bodyguards, while Velasquez was captured by the police and spent more than 10 years in prison.  Consequences  After Lara's death, the Betancur government immediately approved the extradition law and began a war against organized crime. In turn, Enrique Parejo Gonz√°lez was appointed Minister of Justice. He directed a harsh attack against drug trafficking, leading to the extradition of three members of the Medell√≠n Cartel to the United States. In 2009, Rodrigo Lara Restrepo and the sons of the late Luis Carlos Gal√°n announced to the media their forgiveness of Sebastian Marroquin (formerly Juan Pablo Escobar), son of the late Pablo Escobar, who apologized for the damage done to the country in his two decades of narco-terrorism, as told in the documentary film Sins of My Father (2009).

Put simply, hot cognition is cognition coloured by emotion. Hot cognition contrasts with cold cognition, which implies cognitive processing of information that is independent of emotional involvement. Hot cognition is proposed to be associated with cognitive and physiological arousal, in which a person is more responsive to environmental factors. As it is automatic, rapid and led by emotion, hot cognition may consequently cause biased and low-quality decision making. Hot cognition may arise, with varying degrees of strength, in politics, religion, and other sociopolitical contexts because of moral issues, which are inevitably tied to emotion. Hot cognition was initially proposed in 1963 by Robert P. Abelson. This idea became popular in the 1960s and the 1970s. An example of a biased decision caused by hot cognition would be a juror disregarding evidence because of an attraction to the defendant. Decision making with cold cognition is more likely to involve logic and critical analysis. Therefore, when an individual engages in a task when displaying cold cognition, the stimulus is likely to be emotionally neutral and the \\"outcome of the test is not motivationally relevant\\" to the individual. An example of a critical decision using cold cognition would be concentrating on the evidence before drawing a conclusion. Hot and cold cognition form a dichotomy within executive functioning. Executive functioning has long been considered as a domain general cognitive function, but there has been support for separation into \\"hot\\" affective aspects and \\"cold\\" cognitive aspects. It is recognized that executive functioning spans across a number of cognitive tasks including working memory, cognitive flexibility and reasoning in active goal pursuit. The distinction between hot and cool cognition implies that executive function may operate differently in different contexts. The distinction has been applied to research in cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, clinical psychology, social psychology, neuropsychology, and other areas of study in psychology. Development and neuroanatomy Performance on hot and cold tasks improves most rapidly during the preschool years, but continues into adolescence. This co-occurs with both structural and functional development associated with the prefrontal cortex. Specific areas within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are thought to be associated with both hot and cold cognition. Hot cognition is likely to be utilized during tasks that require the regulation of emotion or motivation, as well as the re-evaluation of the motivational significance of a stimulus. The ventral and medial areas of the prefrontal cortex (VM-PFC) are implicated during these tasks. Cold cognition is thought to be associated with executive functions elicited by abstract, deconceptualized tasks, such as card sorting. The area of the brain that is utilized for these tasks is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC). It is between the ages of 3 years and 5 years that the most significant change in task completion is seen. Age-related trends have been observed in tasks used to measure hot cognition, as well as cold cognition. However, the age at which children reach adult-like functioning varies. It appears as though children take longer to fully develop hot executive functioning than cold. This lends support to the idea that hot cognition may follow a separate, and perhaps delayed, developmental trajectory as opposed to cold cognition. Further research done on these neurological areas suggests there may be some plasticity during the development of both hot and cold cognition. While the preschool years are ones of extreme sensitivity to the development of prefrontal cortex, a similar period is found in the transition into adolescence. This gives rise to the idea that there may be a time window for intervention training, which would improve cognitive abilities and executive functioning in children and adolescents. Assessment This section explains the most common tasks that are used to measure hot and cold cognitive functioning. The cool tasks are neutrally affective and measure executive function abilities such as cognitive flexibility and working memory. In other words, there is nothing to be gained or lost by performing these tasks. The hot tasks also measure executive function, but these tasks result in emotionally significant consequences. Hot function tasksIowa gambling task= In the Iowa gambling task participants are initially given $2,000 facsimile dollars and asked to win as much money as possible. They are presented with four decks of cards that represent either a gain or loss in money. One card from each deck is drawn at a time. Consistently choosing a card from the advantageous decks results in a net gain, whereas choosing from a disadvantageous deck results in a net loss. Each card from the disadvantageous deck offers a higher reward than the advantageous deck, but also a higher and more variable loss. =Delay of gratification= Studies have been conducted on the concept of delay of gratification to test whether or not people are capable of waiting to receive a reward in order to increase the value of the reward. In these experiments, participants can choose to either take the reward they are immediately presented with or can choose to wait a period of time to then receive a higher valued reward. Hot cognition would motivate people to immediately satisfy their craving for the present reward rather than waiting for a better reward. =Neutral versus negative syllogisms tasks= The influence that beliefs can have on logical reasoning may vary as a result of emotions during cognitive processes. When presented with neutral content, this will typically lead to the exhibition of the belief-bias effect. In contrast, content that is emotionally charged will result in a diminished likelihood of beliefs having an influence. The impact of negative emotions demonstrates the capability they have for altering the process underlying logical reasoning. There is an interaction that occurs between emotions and beliefs that interferes with the ability that an individual has to reason. Cold function tasks The cool tasks are neutrally affective and measure executive function abilities such as cognitive flexibility and working memory. In other words, there is nothing to be gained or lost by performing these tasks. The hot tasks also measure executive function, but these tasks result in emotionally significant consequences. =Self Ordered Pointing= In this task an array of items is presented to participants. The position of these items then randomly changes from trial to trial. Participants are instructed to point to one of these items, but then asked to not point to that same item again. In order to perform well on this task, participants must remember what item they pointed to and use this information to decide on subsequent responses. =Wisconsin Card Sort Task (WCST)= The Wisconsin Card Sort Task requires participants to sort stimulus cards that differ in dimensions (shape, colour, or number). However, they are not told how to sort them. The only feedback they receive is whether or not a match is correct. Participants must discover the rule according to dimension. Once the participant matches a certain number of correct cards, the dimension changes and they must rediscover the new rule. This requires participants to remember the rule they were using and cognitively change the rule by which they use to sort. =Dimensional Change Card Sort Task (DCCS)= Participants are required to sort stimulus cards based on either shape or colour. They are first instructed to sort based on one dimension (colour) in a trial, and then it switches to the other (shape) in the following trial. \\"Switch\\" trials are also used where the participant must change back and forth between rules within a single trial. Unlike the WCST, the rule is explicitly stated and does not have to be inferred. The task measures how flexible participants are to changing rules. This requires participants to shift between dimensions of sorting. Recent evidence Research has demonstrated emotional manipulations on decision making processes. Participants who are induced with enthusiasm, anger or distress (different specific emotions) responded in different ways to the risky-choice problems, demonstrating that hot cognition, as an automatic process, affects decision making differently. Another example of hot cognition is a better predictor of negative emotional arousal as compared to cold cognition when they have a personal investment, such as wanting your team to win. In addition, hot cognition changes the way people use decision-making strategies, depending on the type of mood they are in, positive or negative. When people are in a positive mood, they tend to use compensatory, holistic strategies. This leads to a shallow and broad processing of information. In a negative mood people employ non-compensatory, narrow strategies which leads to a more detail-oriented and thorough processing of information. In the study participants were shown movie clips in order to induce a mood of happiness, anger or sadness and asked to complete a decision-making task. Researchers found that participants in the negative mood condition used more non-compensatory, specific decision-making techniques by focusing on the details of the situation. Participants in the positive mood condition used more compensatory, broad decision making techniques by focusing on the bigger picture of the situation. Also, hot cognition has been implicated in automatic processing and autobiographical memory. Furthermore, hot cognition extends outside the laboratory as exhibited in political process and criminal judgments. When police officers were induced with sadness they were more likely to think the suspect was guilty. However, if police officers were induced with anger there was no difference in judgments. There are also clinical implications for understanding certain disorders. Patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa went through intervention training, which included hot cognition as a part of emotional processing development, did not show any improvement after this training. In another clinical population, those diagnosed with bipolar disorder exaggerated their perception of negative feedback and were less likely to adjust their decision making process in the face of risky-choices (gambling tasks).

MacDonald and starring Billie Piper, Michelle Ryan, and Blake Ritson. Adapted from Jane Austen's classic 1814 novel of the same name, the film is about a young girl who is sent by her poor mother to live with wealthy relatives at their Mansfield estate. By the age of eighteen, the young woman falls in love with her sensitive cousin who is studying to be a clergyman. Her feelings for him and her moral sense prevent her from accepting a marriage proposal from a much wealthier suitor. Mansfield Park premiered on 18 March 2007 on the United Kingdom network ITV at 9:00 p.m., as part of The Jane Austen Season. It was filmed at Newby Hall, North Yorkshire, England. It made its TV debut in Canada on 23 December 2007 and in the United States on 27 January 2008. The drama ran for two hours (including advertisement breaks) in the United Kingdom, 90 minutes without the breaks.

In Fanny Price, Austen dared to portray a diffident, anxious heroine who nevertheless displays an iron will. Byrne argues that \\"In this regard, Fanny Price is the most interesting of Austen‚Äôs heroines and the one whom the conventions of modern cinema and television are least well qualified to serve\\".

Portillo and written by John R. Stevenson. It stars Jessica Morris, Crystalle Ford, Peter Guillemette, and Patrick Cavanaugh. The plot follows a group of counselors working at a summer camp, where a masked assailant begins a murder spree. The film was released direct-to-video. Bloody Murder is often criticized for being too similar to the Friday the 13th and Scream franchises. It was followed by a sequel, Bloody Murder 2: Closing Camp (2003), and a spin-off, The Graveyard (2006).  Plot  Teenage friends Julie, Jason, Dean, Whitney and Tobe are working as summer camp counselors at Camp Placid Pines. Their boss Patrick introduces them to the other counselors Drew, Brad, Jamie and Doug. The groundskeeper, Henry, warns Julie that there is something dangerous in the woods, but Patrick dismisses him as crazy. Later that night, the counselors play a game called \\"Bloody Murder\\", a combination of hide and seek and tag. After Jason and Whitney have sex, Jason is confronted by an unknown person. The next morning, Julie is concerned about Jason's whereabouts and is told he was taking a few days off. The following night, the counselors gather to watch a movie and Whitney is killed in the kitchen by someone wearing a hockey mask. The next day, the counselors inform the local sheriff that Jason and Whitney have gone missing, and Dean is taken in for questioning. At the archery range, Brad is killed and Dean is released from custody at the sheriff station. Julie is attacked by the killer in the woods before Dean is also killed by having his throat slit. Julie finds a photo of her dad at the camp with someone named Nelson Hammond, and discovers that Nelson was almost killed in an accident involving the game Bloody Murder. Years later, he returned to the camp and killed one of the counselors involved. That night, Julie is attacked again but realizes her attacker is Jason and locks him in the freezer. Jason is taken in by the police. The killer murders Doug before Julie's father arrives and walks with Drew to the lake. Julie gathers her things from her cabin and discovers that Drew's father was Bill Anderson, the man that Nelson killed for revenge, and concludes that Drew is the killer. Julie's father is knocked into the lake. Moments later, Julie confronts Drew before the killer arrives and attacks them, proving her wrong. Drew is knocked out and Julie flees. She runs into Patrick, who reveals he is actually the killer and Nelson Hammond. He chases Julie through the woods before she arrives at the main camp, where Patrick says that Julie hit her head and is delusional. He then takes a swing at her with an axe, but Drew appears and shoots him in the arm before he is arrested for his crimes. At the station, Patrick denies killing Doug and says someone named Trevor Moorehouse must have been responsible. Julie's father and Drew are taken to the hospital as the remaining counselors depart the camp. As Jason is walking home alone, another hockey-masked assailant, wielding a chainsaw, suddenly comes out of the bushes. Jason screams in terror and the film ends.  Cast Production Filming took place in California at three different camps, which were edited to appear as one location. Release Bloody Murder was released on VHS on August 21, 2000, and on DVD on September 12, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. Reception Buzz McClain of AllMovie condemned the film as \\"infuriatingly boring\\" and gave it 1/5. A 1 was also awarded by John Fallon of Arrow in the Head, who wrote, \\"Movies like this make you realize just how good Friday the 13th and Scream are. It tries to blend both together but fails for three reasons: It has no heart, it has no brain and it has no balls. This flick is not even fun in a bad way\\", and Devon Bertsch of Digital Retribution, who wrote, \\"The plotting can get so bad it's almost gibberish. The acting is atrocious. There are BAD fade-outs and just general fades, and poor editing for continuity and the things that need a quick pace. Too many theories as to what happened are presented visually, like some bizarre homage to the ending of Clue, or even Wayne's World. It's all bad, and the great tragedy is that it's not even funny, dammit!\\" The film garnered further 1's from G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk, who referred to Bloody Murder as \\"less a horror movie, but more an inane whodunit with the production values of an after school special with a couple dirty words mixed in\\", and Robert Pardi of TV Guide, who dismissed Bloody Murder as a \\"generic Friday the 13th rip-off\\" that \\"is the very model of anonymous filmmaking\\". In a review for DVD Verdict, Patrick Naugle lambasted the film, writing, \\"I don't even know where to begin to talk about this movie. It's terrible. It goes beyond terrible. At least cheesy, cruddy films such as the ones Roger Corman made were enjoyable to watch for their high camp value. Bloody Murder doesn't even have that going for it\\".

The state has about twenty five percent of the national potential. About 27,436 MW of hydroelectric power can be generated in the state by the construction of various hydroelectric projects on the five perennial river basins. Out of total hydroelectric potential of the state, 10,519 MW is harnessed so far, out of which only 7.6% is under the control of Himachal Pradesh Government while the rest is exploited by the Central Government. The state government has been giving the highest priority for its development, since hydroelectric generation can meet the growing need of power for industry, agriculture and rural electrification. It is also the biggest source of income to the state as it provides electricity to other states. Himachal has enough resources to generate surplus power but in winter less flow of water in rivers and increases in lighting and heating load can result in power shortages that overshoot ten lakh units per day. Due to increased industrialization and rural electrification this figure is expected to rise even further.  Completed projects = Girinagar Hydel Project  Situated on the river Giri of the Sirmour District, Girinagar Hydel project has an installed capacity of 60 MW, with 2 units of 30 MW each.

Prelude By the early June 1947, the communists had successfully isolated Siping (city) in their Summer Offensive of 1947 in Northeast China, the communists decided to take the city despite the fact that they had totally lacked the experience of taking strongly defended cities that are heavily fortified, and it was obvious to both sides that the isolated city would be the next battlefield. Siping (city) was defended by three divisions belong to two separate armies and the commander of the nationalist 71st Army, Chen Mingren (ÈôàÊòé‰ªÅ) was named as the nationalist commander-in-chief of the urban defense. All three nationalist divisions suffered greatly in earlier battles and none of them was fully manned. However, the communists had eradicated nationalists in the region from Tieling in the south and Changchun in the north, and most of these nationalist forces had retreated to Siping (city). Chen Mingren (ÈôàÊòé‰ªÅ) successfully recruited and incorporated these forces into his force, and every able bodied- man who had a governmental job was also recruited into the local garrison. Construction for additional fortifications and strengthening the current ones was also completed in very short span of time, and in a devoted effort, many bunkers were built by sacks full of wheat and starch of American aid. On June 3, 1947, Chiang Kai-shek flew to Shenyang and personally wrote to Chen Mingren (ÈôàÊòé‰ªÅ) stating that Siping (city) was a very important location in Northeast China and if lost, the nationalists would not only lose Northeast China, but also endangering the rest of China, so the city must be defended at all cost, and Chen Mingren (ÈôàÊòé‰ªÅ) was determined to hold the city, and the nationalist reporters claimed the city as Chen Mingren (ÈôàÊòé‰ªÅ)'s fortress after witnessing the extensive defensive complex built. On June 9, 1947, the enemy had completed its regroup outside the city for the upcoming attack. However, the communist made a serious intelligence blunder in underestimating the defenders' strength by only assessing the total nationalist strength as 18,000, and even Lin Biao had erroneously believed that there were only four fully combat capable nationalist regiments with full strength in the city. The enemy had missed the significant intelligence including the defenders receiving airdrop of 400 tons of supplies and weaponry in more than 200 sorties from Shenyang, and the rapid new construction of the fortifications. The defenders' recruitment of previously defeated nationalist forces into the local garrison was completely undetected by the enemy, and enemy did not expect the nationalist air force would actively participate in the first stage in support of the ground troops defending the city either. This serious intelligence blunder would have to be paid with an extremely heavy price later in the first stage of the campaign. Order of battle Defenders: nationalist order of battle: *First stage (more than 35,000 troops total): **The 87th Division of the 71st Army **The 88th Division of the 71st Army **The 54th Division of the 13th Army *Second stage: nationalist units with more than 19,000 troops Attackers: communist order of battle: *The 1st Column *The 7th Column *The 6th Column (First stage) *The 3rd Column (Second Stage) First stage On June 11, 1947, the communists begun their assault on the nationalist positions outside the city, and on the same night, the airport at the western suburb of the city was taken by the communist 7th Column. On June 13, 1947, the communist 1st Column took Xinlitun, and the nationalist air force begun to attack enemy ground positions at a rate of near twenty sorties per day in order to support the defenders of the city. On June 14, 1947, Lin Biao ordered the 11th Division and the 12th Division of the communist 4th Column to strike south toward Shenyang and Fushun to distract nationalist forces stationed in those cities from reinforcing Siping (city), and to take Fushun if possible. At 8:00 PM on June 14, 1947, the assault on the city itself had begun with five communist artillery battalions with near a hundred large caliber artillery pieces starting to bombard the city, even the 12 anti- aircraft artilleries in the communist inventory were deployed to shell the city. The shelling shocked the nationalist defenders since merely a year ago, artillery was still an extremely rare commodity for the communists, yet a year later the communist artillery firepower was greater than that of Japanese during World War II. Under the cover of intense artillery shelling, the communist 1st Column and 7th Column attacked the defenders from multiple directions. Forty minutes after the assault begun, the 2nd Division of the communist 1st Column breached the defense in the southwest, and by 2:00 AM on June 15, 1947, the 1st Division of the communist 1st Column also penetrated into the city from Haifeng Village (Haifeng Tun, Êµ∑‰∏∞Â±Ø). However, the communist 7th Column and the 3rd Division of the communist 1st Column failed to breach the defense, and nationalist reserve launched multiple counterattacks on the enemy under the air cover, which had increased into more than twenty sorties per day. By June 16, 1947, the communists 1st Division and the 2nd Division inside the city had beaten back defenders' counterattacks for more than a dozen times, but in doing so, each suffered more than 1,500 casualties. The regions inside the city taken by the enemy was relatively small and only a thousand or so defenders were captured alive by the enemy, but situation for the defenders worsened on June 18, 1947 when the communist 7th Column breached the defense in northwest. The nationalists had underestimated the enemy's resolution to take the city, and defenders' stubborn resistance was equally out of expectation of the attacking communists as battle raged on with heavy casualties on both sides. By June 19, 1947, Lin Biao was forced to send the 17th Division and the 18th Division of the communist 6th Column to reinforce the communists fighting inside the city. With the newly arrived help, the enemy was able to take nationalist strongholds at the Telecommunication Building, the Municipal Building, and the Central Bank Building, and the nationalist headquarters of the 71st Army that was also the headquarters of the urban defense was besieged. There were many brick buildings in Siping (city) and bricks made from black earth were extremely tough that when hit by 60 mm mortar rounds, there was only a dent left. The defenders capitalized on these strong buildings and turned them into formidable fortifications, and the nationalist 71st Army headquarters was located in one of such bunkers, with the entrance sealed by a jeep. In addition to wide field of view, there were also dozens bunkers and pillboxes protected by minefields around the buildings to strengthen the defense. On June 20, 1947, the 17th Division of the communist 6th Column unleashed its assault on the nationalist headquarters, and by the evening, the enemy was dangerously close. Chen Mingren (ÈôàÊòé‰ªÅ), the nationalist commander-in-chief inside the headquarters was forced to evacuate into another alternate headquarters in a different bunker in the eastern half of the city, while his brother, Chen Mingxin (ÈôàÊòé‰ø°), the regimental commander of the Specialized Duties Regiment of the nationalist 71st Army, was left to defend the original headquarters. After three hours of fierce fighting, the headquarters fell and its defenders were annihilated. Chen Mingxin (ÈôàÊòé‰ø°), the regimental commander of the Specialized Duties Regiment of the nationalist 71st Army, was captured alive by the enemy, and the stronghold that the nationalists claimed to withstand enemy attack for more than a month fell in just three short hours. The fall of the nationalist 71st Army headquarters had signaled the fall of the western half of the city into the enemy hands, but the enemy had paid a very heavy price: the 1st Division and the 2nd Division of the communist 1st Column, and the Independent 1st Division and the Independent 2nd Division of communist 7th Column suffered heavy casualties that they were forced out of action, and Ma Renxing (È©¨‰ªÅÂÖ¥), the divisional commander of the 1st Independent Division of the communist 7th Column, became the highest ranked communist officer killed in the campaign. After more than a week of fierce fighting, the enemy finally took western half of the city with heavy loss. Only then did the enemy realize the serious blunder of the underestimation of the defenders: the nationalists defending the city was not 18,000 like previously thought, but almost twice, totaling more than 35,000. On June 21, 1947, the enemy was forced to send their reserves to join the fight: the 16th Division of the communist 6th Column and the Independent 3rd Division of the communist 7th Column join the assault on the eastern half of city, and Hong Xuezhi, (Ê¥™Â≠¶Êô∫), the commander-in-chief of the communist 6th Column succeeded Li Tianyou (ÊùéÂ§©‰Ωë), the commander-in-chief of the communist 1st Column in the last part of the fighting as the communist commander in charge of taking the city. Chen Mingren (ÈôàÊòé‰ªÅ), the nationalist commander-in-chief of the urban defense, concentrated his remaining 20,000 strong force in the eastern half of the city, and by the evening of June 21, 1947, had successfully beaten back all enemy attacks. For the communists, it was impossible to achieve numerical superiority after sending in two divisions following the withdraw of four divisions, and the Independent 1st Division of the communist 7th Column withdrawn earlier was forced to be back in action again. The highest point in the Siping (city) was a water tower, and the nationalists turned it into a formidable bunker manned by tough veterans of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in Burma and India during World War II, and these sharpshooters armed with light machine guns had successfully beaten back attacks by an entire enemy regiment for four times. After concentrating over a dozen machine guns suppressing the nationalist fire from the loopholes of the bunker to cover sappers setting up the explosives, the enemy finally neutralized the bunker in its fifth attempt. At the railroad crossing bridge, the defenders used an ingenious tactic by deploying beans: as three attacks by the communist 8th Regiment of the 1st Column were beaten back, the enemy launched their fourth attack personally led by the regimental political commissar Jin Ke (ÈáëÂèØ), and it appeared that the fourth attack might be successful. However, the defenders unleashed their secret weapon by opening two large sacks of beans which suddenly filled the ground. Everyone in the unsuspecting enemy assault team slid down and had very difficult time of getting up, and with beans on the ground, it was impossible to advance, retreat or reinforce, thus the enemy assault team was completely wiped out. Jin Ke (ÈáëÂèØ), the regimental political commissar of the communist 8th Regiment of the 1st Column leading the fourth charge, was cut in half at the chest by a string of defenders' machine gun fire in front of the regimental commander of the communist 8th Regiment of the 1st Column, Guan Shanlin (ÂÖ≥Â±±Êûó), and thus became the second highest ranked communist officer killed in action during the campaign. The streets of Siping (city) was covered with blood and soldiers of both sides frequently slid down, and the situation became desperate for the defenders that Chen Mingren (ÈôàÊòé‰ªÅ), the nationalist commander-in-chief of the urban defense, was preparing to commit suicide and had his Browning pistol ready. Chen Mingren (ÈôàÊòé‰ªÅ) also ordered the defenders to burn every building after it was abandoned so that the attacking enemy would not be able to use it. After fierce battles, the last counterattack of the nationalist 71st Army was beaten back with heavy loss in the morning of June 23, 1947, but the communist 1st Independent Division of the 7th Column suffered equally and was forced out of action once again for the second time. Although the defenders could no longer launch anymore counterattacks to the smallest scale, they were still able to put up a good defensive fight in their fortifications, but as time dragged on, even the defenders themselves begun to have serious doubts how long before the city would fall into the enemy hands. The communists were overconfident that the city would fall for sure, and their New China News Agency had already issued a press release at the time, claiming that \\"‚Ä¶After 12 days of fierce fighting, the enemy (nationalists) had suffered over 16,000 casualties and remaining survivors had nowhere to flee. The majority of the Siping had been under our (communist) control, and Chiang's army had been annihilated, and our troops (communists) were expanding the military success‚Ä¶\\". On June 28, 1947, the communist commander Chen Yi (communist) even sent a telegraph congratulating Lin Biao for taking the city. Nothing could be further from the truth as the situation suddenly turned drastically in nationalist favor: on June 29, 1947, the nationalist reinforcement rapidly approached the city thanks to their mechanization, the nationalist 93rd Army approached the city on the same day Lin Biao received the telegraph from Chen Yi (communist), while on June 29, 1947, the nationalist New 6th Army took Benxi and from there pushed toward Siping (city), while the nationalist 53rd Army on the left of the New 6th Army also pushed toward Siping (city) in unison. The highly mechanized nationalist armies was able to bypass the enemy and thus not only the nationalist reinforcement had avoided been ambushed by the enemy, now the enemy force attacking the city was threatened. The table had turned for the enemy. Lin Biao's choice was clear, on June 30, 1947, he ordered a general withdraw that concluded the first stage of Siping Campaign. The exhausted defenders had no strength left to give any chase and the nationalist reinforcement did not pursuit the enemy either after reaching the city, and thus did not see any action, just like the five enemy armies to the south of the city originally planned to ambush them. The nationalists suffered over 19,000 casualties while the communist suffered over 13,000 casualties. The nationalists had successfully beaten back the enemy and held the city. In addition to the enemy's grave underestimation of the defenders' strength, the associating indecisiveness of Lin Biao also contributed to the nationalist success at the first stage of the campaign: Lin Biao was trying to increase the gain of the communist Summer Offensive of 1947 in Northeast China by deploying seventeen divisions to the south of Siping (city) in the hope of ambush nationalist reinforcement, but this had not materialized. The seven remaining communist divisions were simply not enough to take on the five technically superior nationalist Divisions defending the city. Furthermore, only after suffering heavy losses, did the two more divisions were redeployed to join the fight, but by then the communists were unable to achieve any numerical superiority at all, following the withdraw of four divisions and earlier heavy losses. However, the communists would not forget their goal and they would be back with vengeance, as well as the valuable experience learned from this first attempt. For the nationalists, the city was still in their hands, but the nationalist original plan to fight a decisive battle to annihilate the enemy at the gate of Siping (city) was equally spoiled by Lin Biao's wise and timely retreat, and thus the first stage of the campaign ended in a stalemate. Second stage After their victory of the Autumn Offensive of 1947 in Northeast China, the communists set their sights on the Siping (city) again in their Winter Offensive of 1947 in Northeast China, and this time they were ready and much better prepared. By this time, the nationalists in Northeast China had suffered greatly and Siping (city) was only garrisoned by a mere 19,000 troops, without any hope of reinforcement. The first sign of trouble appeared when a transportation battalion of the nationalist 88th Division was ambushed on January 26, 1948 at Guo Family's Hotel (Guo Jia Dian, ÈÉ≠ÂÆ∂Â∫ó) as the 500-men strong battalion attempted to transport grains to the city. Though the enemy attack was considered unlikely, the nationalists nonetheless doubled the strength of the battalion and assigned over a dozen trucks and over 100 horse-drawn carts to ensure the safe completion of the job. Learning the news, Luo Jie (ÁΩóÊù∞), the deputy commander-in-chief of the communist base at the border area of Liaoning and Jilin, personally lead the units of the communist 18th Regiment and the Mongolian Cavalry Regiment launched a long distance surprise attack before dawn on the unsuspecting nationalist transportation battalion. In a short period of 40 minutes, over 70 nationalist soldiers were killed and more than 200 were captured alive by the enemy. The rest of the nationalists were able to successfully escape by trucks, but a truck and all of the 100+ horse-drawn carts full of grains had to be abandoned and left intact for the enemy in the hasty retreat. On February 27, 1948, the order was formally given to take the city and the commander-in-chief of the communist 1st Column, Li Tianyou (ÊùéÂ§©‰Ωë), the communist commander in charge of last assault on the city nearly nine months ago, was put in charge again for the second time. Similarly, two communist columns participated in the assault on the city nearly nine months ago, the 1st Column and the 7th Column, were tasked to take the city, with the help of the communist 3rd Column, while the communist 2nd Column, 6th Column, 8th Column, and 10th Column were deployed to stop any possible nationalist reinforcement that never came, because the nationalist strength was greatly reduced by this time. On March 4, 1948, the enemy assault on the nationalist positions outside the city begun, and the communist 1st Division of the 1st Column took Haifeng Village (Hai Feng Tun, Êµ∑‰∏∞Â±Ø) and Xu Family's Yaodong (Xu Jia Yao, ÂæêÂÆ∂Á™ë), while the 3rd Division of the communist 1st Column took Xinlitun. The enemy had made significant gains on March 8, 1948 when most of the nationalist positions outside the city wall fell in a domino effect: the 7th Division of the communist 3rd Column took the bunkers outside the eastern gate, while the 8th Division of the communist 3rd Column took the region of Red Mouth (Hong Zui Zi, Á∫¢Âò¥Â≠ê). Meanwhile, the 19th Division of the communist 7th Column took the Third Line of Grove (San Dao Lin Zi, ‰∏âÈÅìÊûóÂ≠ê). In order to find better positions for the artilleries to shell the defenders, the enemy took Shidao (Â∏àÈÅì) School, the airport and the Liu Family's Village (Liu Jia Tun, ÂàòÂÆ∂Â±Ø). At 7:40 PM on March 12, 1948, the final assault on the city begun. The nationalist defense was soon breached in five fronts in the north, the east, and the west, and defenders had to resort to street fights for their last stand. By the next day, the nationalist defeat was complete when the entire nationalist garrison of more than 19,000 was totally annihilated by the attacking enemy, who declared the victory on 7:00 PM on March 13, 1948, after the mopping up operation was completed. Outcome The important strategic stronghold had fallen into the enemy hands with the nationalist defeat, and the defenders lost over 35,000 troops, with more than 16,000 in the first major battle, and over 19,000 in the second battle. In addition to capturing the city, the enemy also captured enormous supplies from the nationalists, including 491 machine guns, over 9,000 repeating rifles, over 779,000 rounds of ammunition, over 200 artillery pieces, and over 11,000 rounds of artillery ammunition.

Martell (October 18, 1916 in Natick, Massachusetts ‚Äì October 15, 2003 in College Station, Texas) was a Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Texas A&M; University and award-winning researcher in the field of inorganic chemistry. His research centered on metal chelate compounds, macrocyclic complexes and cryptates. Education Arthur E. Martell was born October 18, 1916 in Natick, Massachusetts. He earned his undergraduate degree in chemistry in 1938 from Worcester Polytechnic Institute before receiving his Ph.D. from New York University. Career After completing his doctorate, Martell returned his alma mater WPI as an instructor in the Department of Chemistry. He later served as chair of the chemistry departments at Clark University and the Illinois Institute of Technology. In 1966, Martell joined the faculty of Texas A&M; University, serving as the Head of the Department of Chemistry until 1980. He was hired specifically to transform the A&M; Chemistry Department into one of national prominence. By the end of his term as Department Head, he had expanded the faculty by thirty to fifty-five tenure- track professionals and attracted many well-known researchers, including F. Albert Cotton to the department. The number of undergraduate chemistry majors tripled, and the number of graduate students quadrupled. While leading the Department of Chemistry, Martell also led a highly productive research group. The group designed new ligands for complexation of iron and aluminium, technology that was used to treat patients suffering from iron or aluminum overload. He cowrote a book on his pioneering research in the chemistry of metal chelate compounds with Nobel Laureate Melvin Calvin, and wrote or edited fourteen other textbooks that are in use by hundreds of chemists and biologists, including works on Critical Stability Constants (six volumes, with R.M. Smith), The Determination and Use of Stability Constants (with R.J. Motekaitis) and Metal COmplexes in Aqueous Solutions (with R.D. Hancock). Martell also authored over 550 articles that were published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, most of which dealt with equilibria, kinetics, and the physical properties of metal chelates, macrocyclic complexes and cryptates. In 1993, he, Motekaitis and Smith developed the first computer database to track the reaction rates of ligands and how they react with ions to form complex chemical compounds. After stepping down as department head in 1980, Martell served as a Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Texas A&M; and continued his research. Although he officially retired from Texas A&M; in 2001, he continued to conduct research with his former group until his death. Suffering from kidney trouble, he was forced to undergo dialysis several days per week, but could be found in his lab on days that he was not scheduled for treatment. Recognition Martell was honored with awards including the Southwest Regional Award of the American Chemical Society, the ACS Award for Distinguished Service to Inorganic Chemistry, and the Patterson-Crane Award. He was elected an honorary lifetime fellow of the New York Academy of Science and to honorary membership in the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry. He was a 1953 Guggenheim Fellow, an NIH Special Fellow, and a National Science Foundation Senior Postdoctoral Fellow. Family life Martell was married twice. His first marriage, to Norma Saunders, resulted in six children, Jon, Elaine, Stuart, Ed, Janet, and Judy, while his second, to Mary Austin , produced two additional children, Helen and Kathryn. Martell highly enjoyed the outdoors, spending much of his free time hiking, skiing, and fishing. One of his biggest personal accomplishments was successfully climbing the Matterhorn.

His titles included Hakham Bashi and Gaon. He is likely a descendant of Samuel Pallache of 16th-century Fez and early 17th-century merchant, diplomat and pirate. He was also father of grand rabbis Abraham Palacci and Isaac Palacci (Rahamim Nissim Palacci) and rabbi Joseph Palacci. He was a member of the Pallache family. (Alternative spellings include: Hayim Palachi, Hayyim Pallache, Hayyim Palache, Haim Palacci, Hayim Palacci, Hayyim Palaggi (and Falaji), Chaim Palagi, and Haim Palatchi, died the 17 Shevat 5628, according to the jewish calendar, his mother's name was Kaden. )  Background  Pallache was born in ƒ∞zmir, Turkey, then known internationally as Smyrna, part of the Ottoman Empire. His parents were Jacob Pallache (a rabbi and kabbalist) and Kali Kaden Hazan. His maternal grandfather was Joseph Raphael ben Hayyim Hazzan (1741-1820), chief rabbi of ƒ∞zmir. He studied under his grandfather and also Isaac ben Elyakim Gatigno. Career=Early years By 1813, aged 25, Palacci was already a rabbi. In 1828, aged 40, he became head of the Bet Yaakov rabbinical seminary. In 1837 or 1838, he became head of a religious court and then became dayan (jurist), marbi≈° torah (teacher of Torah), and rav korel (head rabbi). By 1854 or 1856, he had become Hakham Bashi or Chief Rabbi of Smyrna, appointed by Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I during the Tanzimat period. He served as chief rabbi until his death in 1868. In 1864, he received the award of Mecidiye Order, third class. In 1867, he received a Greek Orthodox delegation: > SMYRNA.‚ÄîInterchange of Visits.‚ÄîWe are happy to learn that a most friendly > feeling prevails at Smyrna among the ecclesiastical heads of the several > religious bodies. The Greek Archbishop, accompanied by his clergy, lately > went to pay a visit to the Chief Rabbi, Haim Palacci. He was received with > all the honors due to his rank. The Archbishop told the rabbi that a similar > visit would be paid by the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople to the Chief > Rabbi of the capital. This friendly understanding was brought about by the > generous act of the Jews who bought six bells carried away by the Turks from > Candia and presented them to the clergy of Smyrna, with the request to > restore them to the churches whence they had been carried away. Murder (1859) Following a murder on March 17, 1859, local police apprehended a Greek meat butcher and Jewish broker as suspects. Rav Hayim Pala√ßi (as his name appears in modern Turkish) wrote to Baron Lionel de Rothschild for support and protection. He also write a liturgy, in which he stated \\"M√ºsl√ºman T√ºrkler Yahudilere inanƒ±p g√ºveniyorlar.\\" (\\"Muslim Turks believe and rely on Jews.\\"). \\"Haim Palacci Dispute\\" By 1865, attempts by secular leaders of Izmir's Jewish community to exploit Palachi's declining health led to communal conflict. Historian D. Gershon Lewental describes the conflict as follows. In November 1865, an administrative committee forced Pallache to accept its oversight, after which a group of lay leaders purchased at reduced cost the concession for the gabelle tax on kosher food and alcohol. The concessionaires refused audit; Pallache repealed the tax completely. The concessionaires went over Pallache as Izmir's hakham bashi to the regional head (hakham bashi kayakami), whose representative conducted an investigation that recommended Pallache's removal in favor of himself (the representative). The Ottoman government accepted the recommendation. Widespread opposition to the Ottoman decision led to delay, repeal, and finally reinstitution of Pallache by October 1867. Pallache agreed to some reforms but died before they took effect. Historian Stanford J. Shaw describes the conflict in his book The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic (1991). He recounts that Palacci was more conservative than other religious leaders during the Tanzimat period. However, the dispute started in November 1865, when other members of the Jewish religious council speculated on the gabelle (food tax) on wine, alcohol, and salt; Palacci annulled the tax. In December 1866, Yakir Geron, grand rabbi of Adrianople, intervened by sending an emissary, rabbi Samuel Danon to resolve the matter; he recommended that Geron dismiss Palacci (and appoint himself, Danon, instead). Jewish members of the Izmir community asked their vali (governor) to hold off, while they sent a mission to Istanbul. The decision that came back was to appoint Palacci as chief rabbi for life. (A longer description appeared in the French L'Histoire des Israelites de l'Empire Ottoman by Mo√Øse Franco in 1897. ) Personal and death Palachi had three sons: Abraham, Isaac, and Joseph, all three of whom were rabbis and the first two succeeded him as grand rabbi. He was conservative in his views and opposed innovations, e.g., adoption of European dress. He died on February 10, 1868. \\"His funeral hearse was attended by all of the city's dignitaries\\", escorted by a battalion of troops, an honor given by the Turkish authorities to only two or three chief rabbis. Legacy=\\"Haim Palacci Dispute\\" The Pallache dispute (above) led to a fifty-year delay in implementation of the Organic Statute of 1865 [sic ‚Äì (1856?)] in Izmir, according to Shaw. Succession Some dispute arose over Palachi's succession. A minority in the local community championed Rabbi Joseph Hakim of Manissa to succeed. A majority wanted his son Abraham to succeed him, including Jews with foreign citizenship. Abraham succeeded his father on October 7, 1869. The second son Isaac (Rahamim Nissim) succeeded his brother Abraham. The third son Joseph was unable to succeed his brothers because he was too young (in this case, under the age of seventy-five). Personal reputation Journey into Jewish Heritage states: > Rabbi Haim Palaggi... was the 'Haham Bashi' of Izmir in the middle of the > 19th century, and founder of the 'Beit Hillel' Synagogue and beit madras > (study hall). He was very knowledgeable, and received letters from all over > the world with questions about Halacha. He wrote 82 books addressing > important issues in Jewish life. The community today is very proud of his > legacy, and speak of him with great respect. In the synagogue, when his name > is mentioned or cited, the congregation stands up and bows with respect. Turkish Jews still refer to his writings and opinions in their ceremonies and writings, particularly :tr:Rav ƒ∞zak Alaluf in ≈ûalom newspaper: 2015, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008. Opinions His rabbinical opinions continue to receive attention worldwide today, e.g., his 1869 opinion \\"On the Possibilities of Synagogue Reform: An Ottoman Rabbi's Answer to a Query in Paris,\\" reprinted in 2014. He has been called a Gaon in memory of the Geonim, e.g., \\"And the Lion of the gaonim, the elderly Gaon Chaim Palaji of Izmir...\\" and a \\"19th century living Gaon.\\" Pilgrimage gravesite A main attraction of Gurcesme is \\"the grave of Rabbi Palaggi, which was moved to this cemetery from its original burial place, in the 1920s... and people from all over the world come to pray at his grave\\" as \\"pilgrimage to Rabbi Palaggi's grave.\\" Journey into Jewish Heritage (Zalman Shazar Center) recommends that \\"Rabbi Haim Palaggi's grave should be marked as a landmark for orientation, and the building of a pergola should be considered for the visitors‚Äô comfort.\\" Palacci's grave lies in Plot B.4. It is one of the graves \\"brought over from the old cemetery and put in between the existing graves. This is the reason why the grave is at right angles to all the rest.\\" Synagogue A synagogue in Izmir is named after him (Beth Hillel Synagogue according to Shaw, Beyt Hillel Pallache according to Lewental) or his son Abraham. According to Jewish Izmir Heritage, \\"In the 19th century, Rabbi Avraham Palache founded in his home a synagogue named Beit Hillel, after the philanthropist from Bucharest who supported the publication of Rabbi Palache's books. However, the name 'Avraham Palache Synagogue' was also used by the community.\\" This synagogue forms a cluster of eight extant (from a recorded peak of 34 in the 19th century), all adjacent or in the Kemeraltƒ± √áar≈°isi (Kemeraltƒ± marketplace) in Izmir. The heritage organization states, \\"Izmir is the only city in the world in which an unusual cluster of synagogues bearing a typical medieval Spanish architectural style is preserved ...[and] creating an historical architectural complex unique in the world.\\" In its record, Journey into Jewish Heritage calls the Beit Hillel synagogue \\"Avraham Palaggi's synagogue\\" but then states that \\"the synagogue was founded by [the] Palaggi Family in 1840\\" and that Rav Avraham Palaggi \\"used\\" it. \\"The building had been used as a synagogue and a Beit Midrash. The synagogue has not been used since the 1960s.\\" It concludes, \\"The synagogue was founded by the Palaggi family and is therefore very important.\\" Beit Hillel Yeshiva Journey into Jewish Heritage states that Palacci founded the Beit Hillel Yeshiva in the middle of the 19th century. Current sources are unclear, but it is likely the same as the Beit Midrash mentioned above. Bnei Brak yeshiva A seminary was named in Palachi's honor in Bnei Brak, Israel. Family members An index for Abraham Galante's Histoire des Juifs de Torque (Jews of Turkey) includes the following details about Palacci family members: : Samuel Palacci, died 1732, \\"among the most ancient graves in Ku≈üadasƒ± cemetery\\" [...] : Isaac Palacci, brother of Haim : Haim Palacci (1788‚Äì1869) (\\"Effendi\\"), chief rabbi, member of Communal Council in Istanbul, died February 9, 1869 :: Abraham Palacci (1809‚Äì1899), funded for Beit Hilel yeshiva 1840, chief rabbi 1869, died 1899 ::: Salomon Palacci, eldest son of Abraham, whose candidacy for grand rabbi failed ::: Nissim Palacci, son of Abraham, who supported his brother Salomon for grand rabbi :: Isaac Palacci, son of Haim a.k.a.

Specifically, it names Nissim ben Abraham ben Haim and Nissim ben Isaac (ben Jacob and brother of Haim), but the other two mentions of \\"Nissim\\" have no patronymic or clear reference to other family members. The Nissim of 1928-1931 and 1935‚Äì1939 must be a third person, as the previous must have died by then. Unassigned are the details for a Nissim who was \\"ca. 1895: Member of First Instance Court in Izmir.\\") Works Palacci began writing at the age of sixteen and wrote more than 70 or 80 religious works, published in Salonica, Istanbul, Jerusalem, and Izmir. Of these, he wrote: 7 works on the Bible, nine essays on the Talmud, 15 books of Midrash and homiletics, moral books, and 24 connected to law, acceptance, Q&A;, and other subjects.

History The castle, probably built at the end of the 13th century, is on a rocky crest at an altitude of 380 m. It was certainly built at the instigation of the Hohenstaufens for hunting brigands taking refuge in the area. Destroyed around 1280, it was rebuilt in 1286 and is mentioned in 1287 as the property of the Bishop of Strasbourg, ally of the Habsburgs. He entrusted the upkeep to the Lichtenbergs and pledged its allegiance to Sch≈ìneck. The castle was restored between 1335 and 1390 to adapt it to the progress of artillery. It was modernised between 1545 and 1547 by the Exkbrechts of Durckheim, who had held the fiefdom since 1517. The castle was finally destroyed in 1680 by French troops, on the order of Louis XIV and, after the French Revolution, the ruins were bought by the Dietrich family. The castle has been listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1984. Ch√¢teau fort dit Ch√¢teau Schoeneck  Description  A small vaulted door and a larger entrance flanked by two 16th century bastions with cannon holes are still visible. The remains of the manor buildings appear as a Lombard frieze, notably because of the bay windows on the upper level outside the western curtain wall, with their narrow semi-circular arches. To the west, a rectilinear curtain wall closes the lower courtyard while, in the east, a long wall is flanked by two towers.

Details: The design combines a nanoscale crossbar switch structure with conventional CMOS to create a hybrid chip that is simpler to fabricate and offers greater flexibility in the choice of nanoscale devices. The FPNI improves on a field- programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture by lifting the configuration bit and associated components out of the semiconductor plane and replacing them in the interconnect with nonvolatile switches, which decreases both the area and power consumption of the circuit -- while providing up to eight times the density at less cost. This is an example of a more comprehensive strategy for improving the efficiency of existing semiconductor technology: placing a level of intelligence and configurability in the interconnect can have a profound effect on integrated circuit performance, and can be used to significantly extend Moore's Law without having to shrink the transistors.

It followed up on earlier research by Nakajima and the Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters into boosting a large radial engine with an exhaust-driven turbo-supercharger, which had begun in 1942, well before the B-29 raids began.

Nakajima started in July 1943 with the construction of three prototypes, to be completed between November 1944 and January 1945, and seven pre-production aircraft, to be delivered by April 1945. The Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters made itself felt during the development of the Ki-87 prototype when they insisted upon placing the turbo-supercharger in the rear-fuselage, and from the sixth prototype the Nakajima fighter was to have that arrangement. The Ki-87 had a rearward folding undercarriage to accommodate the storage of ammunition for the cannons, which were mounted in the wing. Construction was delayed due to problems with the electrical undercarriage and the turbo-supercharger, and the first prototype was not completed until February 1945; it first flew in April, but only five test flights were completed, all with the undercarriage in the extended position. A further variant, the Ki-87-II, powered by a 3,000 hp Nakajima Ha217 (Ha-46) engine and with the turbo-supercharger in the same position as the P-47 Thunderbolt, never went further than the drawing board. Operational history Production of 500 aircraft was planned, but the war ended before any more than the single prototype were built. Aircraft markings The sole completed prototype was in natural metal finish; some paintings show a black anti-glare area in front of the cockpit, but this is not seen on any of the known photographs of the plane. However, James P. Gallagher took a photo of the Ki-87 at the abandoned Japanese Army fighter base at Chofu after Japan's surrender. The photo clearly shows a black anti- glare area from the cockpit forward to the tip of the nose. James P.

He was adopted by Matsudaira Katamori in March 1867 as successor to Aizu Domain and received the courtesy title of Wakasa-no-kami and Jij≈´, and Court rank was Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade. In February 1868, Katamori officially retired making Nobunori daimy≈ç. Following the defeat of Aizu forces at the Battle of Aizu in the Boshin War, the new Meiji government ordered Katamori and Nobunori to Tokyo, where in January 1869 they were stripped of their titles and offices and were placed under \\"permanent\\" house arrest. In November 1869, the chieftainship of the Aizu-Matsudaira clan was transferred to Katamori's infant son, Kataharu Matsudaira. In March 1870, Katamori and Nobunori were ordered to accompany the Aizu samurai to their new home of Tanami Domain in far northern Aomori Prefecture. They returned in August 1870 to Tokyo. In August 1873, Matsudaira Moriyuki, the 22nd son of Tokugawa Nariaki, former daimy≈ç of Moriyama Domain and imperial governor of Matsukawa, died. Nobuyuki dissolved his adoption tie to Katamori, which allowed him to posthumously be adopted by Moriyuki, becoming the 9th chieftain of the Moriyama-Matsudaira clan. On October 12, 1876 he departed Yokohama for France, where he studied until June 1879. On July 8, 1884, he was ennobled with the title of viscount (shishaku) under the new kazoku peerage system.

It was founded in 1945 to manufacture monitor speakers for NHK (Japanese Broadcasting Corporation) and was closed down in 1999. The Diatone brand currently sees limited use on aftermarket car stereos and speakers manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric exclusively for the Japanese domestic market. History In the 1940s Mitsubishi Electric successfully developed a hard-ferrite (permanent-magnet) OP magnet and began to prepare for the commercial production of ferrite. The Diatone speaker was developed in the fall of 1945 at Mitsubishi Electric's Ofuna Factory. It began life from the recycling of old stocks of magnets into magnetic speakers. At the time, speaker technology was not very advanced in Japan, and sales were limited to speaker products made by subcontracted manufacturers. However, since goods were in short supply after World War II, and because of strong demand and a promising future market, the company decided to go ahead with full-scale speaker development. At the time, the company benefited from cutting-edge technical help from NHK Science & Technical Research Laboratories -- a relationship that would continue for many years. In 1947 Mitsubishi produced an adjustable resonance cone, and combined it with the OP magnet to produce the 16 cm P-62 F-type dynamic speaker (the antecedent of the P-610). In the 1940s, practically all speaker diaphragms were constructed from plain paper pasted together into a cone shape. Mitsubishi Electric's speaker used a special single-cone paper made from a sheet of Japanese washi paper formed into a conical shape, and delivered groundbreaking performance. Though it was launched in the fall of 1947 to high acclaim, it was in 1950 that the speaker was formally accepted as a speaker for broadcast use. It was the first step into a market dominated by foreign products. The Diatone brand trademark was registered in September 1946, and from 1947 the product came to be known as the Mitsubishi Diatone Speaker.

He was a Pisan of noble family. In 1352 he was a student at Bologna and later filled the office of Lector there as well as at Padua, Pisa, Sienna, and Florence. He also preached for many years with great succession different Italian cities. He died about 1401, renowned no less for sanctity than for learning, and is commemorated in the Franciscan Martyrology on 4 November. Bartholomew's chief title to fame rests upon his remarkable book, \\"De Conformitate Vitae B. P. Francisco ad Vitam Domini Nostri Jesu Christi\\", begun in 1385 and formally approved by the general chapter held at Assisi in 1399. Enthusiastically received on its appearance and long held in high esteem, this work became the object of bitter attacks on the part of Lutherans and Jansenists. Against it Erasmus Alber wrote the \\"Alcoranus Franciscanus\\" (Der Barfusser Monche Eulenspiegel und Alcoran mit einer Vorrede D. M. Luthers, 1531) in reply to which Henry Sedulius, OFM, published his \\"Apologeticus adversus Alcoranum Franciscanorum pro libro Conformitatum\\" (Antwerp, 1607). Subsequent writers on Franciscan history ignored the work; more recently it has been over-praised. Between these extreme views, the \\"Conformities\\" is a book of very uneven value. The parallels between the lives of Our Lord and St. Francis which form its basis are sometimes forced, but nowhere does it make St. Francis the equal of Christ. Side by side with fantastic legends, ridiculous visions, and other absurdities, it contains historical information. It is considered a source of great importance for Franciscan history. It was first printed at Milan in 1510 and in 1513. The new edition published at Bologna in 1590 is mutilated and corrupted, especially in the historical parts, at almost every page. A critical edition of the text was published in tom. IV of the \\"Analecta Franciscana\\" (Quaracchi, 1906). In addition to the \\"Conformities\\", Bartholomew left some thirty other works, including an exposition of the Rule of the Friars Minor found in the \\"Speculum\\" Morin (Rouen, 1509) and a book \\"De Vita B. Mariae Virginis\\", published at Venice in 1596; his Lenten sermons were printed at Milan in 1498, Venice, 1503, and Lyons, 1519. Sbaralea and others have attributed to him the \\"Summa Casuum Conscientiae\\", which is really the work of Bartholomew a S. Concordio of Pisa, O. P., and the \\"Vita B. Gerardi\\", which was written by Bartholomew Albisi.

This was decided by the Finance Ministry in its draft concept on the future of the federal financial administration on 6 November 2006 and the Law on federal financial administration Finanzverwaltungsgesetz was changed accordingly on 1 January 2008. The Bundesfinanzdirektionen were the supreme authority for the main customs offices. On 1 January 2016 the Bundesfinanzdirektionen, the Zollkriminalamt and the Bildungs- und Wissenschaftszentrum der Bundesfinanzverwaltung were transformed into one Generalzolldirektion (General Directorate).e.zoll-info 9/2014 and e.zoll-info 4/2015 Structure The Bundesfinanzdirektionen were located in: :Hamburg (North) ::main customs offices: Hamburg-Hafen, Hamburg- Jonas, Hamburg-Stadt, Itzehoe, Kiel, Stralsund, Oldenburg and Bremen :Cologne (West) ::main customs offices: M√ºnster, Aachen, Dortmund, Duisburg, D√ºsseldorf, Cologne, Krefeld, Frankfurt International Airport and Giessen :Neustadt an der Weinstrasse (Southwest) ::main customs offices: Koblenz, Heilbronn, Karlsruhe, L√∂rrach, Singen, Stuttgart, Ulm, Saarbr√ºcken and Darmstadt :Nuremberg (Southeast) ::main customs offices: Erfurt, Landshut, Munich, Nuremberg, Regensburg, Rosenheim, Schweinfurt and Augsburg :Potsdam (Center) ::main customs offices:Berlin, Frankfurt an der Oder, Potsdam, Dresden, Hanover, Magdeburg, Braunschweig, Bielefeld and Osnabr√ºck. The customs and consumption tax directorates of the Oberfinanzdirektionen Chemnitz (located in Dresden), Karlsruhe (located in Freiburg im Breisgau), Koblenz (located in Neustadt an der Weinstrasse), Cottbus (located in Potsdam), Hamburg, Cologne and Nuremberg are closed. The subordinate main customs offices are divided between the new Bundesfinanzdirektionen and some main customs offices have been attached to other Bundesfinanzdirektionen to make the BFD districts more even. This organisational change in the federal financial administration aims to evenly allocate the workload between the Bundesfinanzdirektionen. This is why the economically weak east of Germany has only one Bundesfinanzdirektion and the strong south and west have three BFDs in Cologne, Nuremberg and Neustadt an der Weinstrasse.

Ondiep was constructed starting 1915. From the 1930, the district was used to house \\"abnormals\\", under the supervision of police, social work and medical workers. While it was intended to have an educational function, training its resident to integrate into society and eventually move out of Ondiep, this seldom happened, adding to the district's reputation as a ghetto within Utrecht. The population has traditionally been highly sedentary with a high percentage of people being born there continuing to live in the district after marriage. However, recent years has seen in increase in young workers and students in the district. 2007 Riots On 11 March 2007, police shot and killed 54-year- old Rinie Mulder, a resident wielding a knife, which touched off two nights of rioting. Reports of the details conflict, but most say Mulder had called the police to come to his aid after he witnessed youths attacking a pregnant woman. The situation was calmed by the imposition of a lockdown on the district, preventing non-residents from entering the district, and the arrest of 135 rioters on 13 March 2007. The police officer involved stated that the resident had threatened the officer.

The worm is round in shape, approximately 10 to 20 millimeters in length (roughly the size of a hazelnut), and bears a strong resemblance to a disembodied pair of buttocks. Because of this, it was given a Latin species name that roughly translates to \\"resembling a pig's rear.\\" The worm has been observed residing just below the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) between 875 and 1,200 meters (2,800 to 4,000 feet) deep ‚Äî even when the sea floor is significantly deeper. The worms are neutrally buoyant, and have been observed floating along with their mouth parts facing downward, and their hind parts towards the ocean surface. As these worms have shown no ability to swim or otherwise propel themselves through the water, and have no long, protruding appendages to catch prey with, they must rely on filter feeding to survive. Current theories suggest that they reside in the oxygen minimum zone because of its cornucopia of detritus and marine snow, and that the worms produce clouds of mucous to capture particles of food and \\"snow,\\" which they later draw into their mouths and ingest. C. pugaporcinus has been found to feed mainly on pelagic phytoplankton, as well as pelagic foraminiferans, silicoflagellates, dinoflagellates, and marine protists. The worm has a segmented body, but the middle segments are highly inflated, giving the animal a round shape. These morphological characteristics are unique among chaetopterids. It is unknown whether the specimens found to date were adult or larval forms. As chaetopterid worms do not spend a predetermined amount of time as planktonic larva, it is possible that the specimens found were actually larva that had simply been unable to settle in an appropriate benthic habitat for their species. Their unusual size (five to ten times larger than any known chaetopterid larvae) might indicate they were adults, but all currently known species of chaetopterid adults prefer to live in the benthic environment, and live in parchment-like tubes on the sea floor. Comparison to larval morphology has indicated that the specimens have a close relationship to either genus Chaetopterus or genus Mesochaetopterus, and a phylogenetic tree constructed from mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA sequences from twelve different Chaetopteridae worms found them to be most closely related to other worms of the genus Chaetopterus. In laboratory settings, C. pugaporcinus has been found to produce bioluminescence when physically stimulated. This bioluminescence is produced as a bright blue light that endures for 3 to 6 seconds. Additionally, the worm will produce very small bioluminescent green particles that are dispersed into its mucous cloud, and glow for 1 to 2 seconds before fading.

There are many types of loan agreements, including \\"facilities agreements,\\" \\"revolvers,\\" \\"term loans,\\" \\"working capital loans.\\" Loan agreements are documented via a compilation of the various mutual promises made by the involved parties. Prior to entering into a commercial loan agreement, the \\"borrower\\" first makes representations about his affairs surrounding his character, creditworthiness, cashflow, and any collateral that he may have available to pledge as security for a loan. These representations are taken into consideration and the lender then determines under what conditions (terms), if any, they are prepared to advance the money. Loan agreements, like any contract, reflect an \\"offer,\\" the \\"acceptance of the offer,\\" \\"consideration,\\" and can only involve situations that are \\"legal\\" (a term loan agreement involving heroin drug sales is not \\"legal\\"). Loan agreements are documented via their commitment letters, agreements that reflect the understandings reached between the involved parties, a promissory note, and a collateral agreement (such as a mortgage or a personal guarantee). Loan agreements offered by regulated banks are different from those that are offered by finance companies in that banks receive a \\"banking charter\\" granted as a privilege and involving the \\"public trust.\\" Loan agreements are usually in written form, but there is no legal reason why a loan agreement cannot be a purely oral contract (although oral agreements are more difficult to enforce). Types For commercial banks and large finance companies, \\"loan agreements\\" are usually not categorized although \\"loan portfolios\\" are often broadly characterized into \\"personal\\" and \\"commercial\\" loans while the \\"commercial\\" category is then subdivided into \\"industrial\\" and \\"commercial real estate\\" loans. \\"Industrial\\" loans are those that depend on the cashflow and creditworthiness of the company and the widgets or service that it sells. \\"Commercial real estate\\" loans are those that repay loans but that depends on the rental revenues paid by tenants who lease space, usually for extended times. More granular categorizations of loan portfolios exist but these are always variations around the larger themes. The loan agreements originated by commercial banks, savings banks, finance companies, insurance organizations, and investment banks are very different from each other and all feed a different purpose. \\"Commercial banks\\" and \\"Savings banks,\\" because they accept deposits and benefit from FDIC insurance, generate loans that incorporate the concepts of the \\"public trust.\\" Prior to interstate banking, that \\"public trust\\" was easily measured by State bank regulators who could see how local deposits were used to fund the working capital needs of local industry and businesses, and the benefits associated with those organization's employment. \\"Insurance\\" organizations, who collect premiums for providing either life or property/casualty coverage, created their own types of loan agreements. \\"Banks\\" and \\"Insurance\\" organizations' loan agreements and documentation standards evolved from their individual cultures and were governed by policies that somehow addressed each organizations liabilities (In the case of \\"banks,\\" the liquidity needs of their depositors; in the case of insurance organizations, the liquidity needs to be associated with their expected \\"claims\\" payments). \\"Investment banks\\" create loan agreements that cater to the needs of the investors whose funds they attempt to attract; \\"investors\\" are always sophisticated and accredited organizations not subject to bank regulatory supervision and the need to cater to the public trust. Investment banking activities are supervised by the SEC and their main focus is on whether the correct or proper disclosures are made to the parties who provide the funds. Types of Loans: * bilateral loans * syndicated loans Categorizing loan agreements by type of facility usually results in two primary categories: * term loans, which are repaid in set installments over the term, or * revolving loans (or overdrafts) where up to a maximum amount can be withdrawn at any time, and interest is paid from month to month on the drawn amount. Within these two categories though, there are various subdivisions such as interest-only loans, and balloon payment loans. It is also possible to subcategorize on whether the loan is a secured loan or an unsecured loan, and whether the rate of interest is fixed or floating. Contents of Loan agreement Forms of loan agreements vary tremendously from industry to industry, country to country, but characteristically a professionally drafted commercial loan agreement will incorporate the following terms: # Parties to contracts with their addresses # Definitions or interpretation provisions # Facility and purposePurpose provisions serve a variety of purposes in different jurisdictions, but they are often used to seek to impose a Quistclose trust on the loan proceeds if the stated purpose of the loan becomes impossible. # Conditions precedent to utilization # Repayment provisions # Prepayment and cancellation provisions # Interest and interest periods # Provisions dealing with gross-up in relation to any withholding imposed # Payments provisions # Representations of the borrower # Representations of the lender # Covenants of the borrowerSuch as a negative pledge. # Events of default # Remedies in the event of default # Provisions for penalties and liquidated damages # For syndicated loans, provisions relating to the facility agent and security agent and voting of the lenders # Formulae for calculations # Provisions for fees of the lenders # Provisions for expenses # Securitization provisions # Amendments and waivers provisions # Covenants relating to changes in parties # Set-off clause # Severability clause # Counterparts clause # Addresses for notices # Language provisions # Choice of law clause # Forum selection clause # Appointment of a process agent See also * Debt * Cleanup clause * Cov-lite * Gross-up_clause Footnotes Category:Contract law Category:Credit Category:Loans ","title":"Loan agreement"},{"id":"10070185","text":"Matsudaira Kataharu Viscount was a Japanese man who served as the daimy≈ç of Tonami han (the former Aizu han) in the early Meiji Era.

Themes 1\\\\. People have good intentions to live by the rules they are given, but no matter how dedicated they are, some rules might be broken for reasons good or bad.Rules by Cynthia Lord 2\\\\. There are flaws in all of us ‚Äì not just those with special needs. 3\\\\. We all try to do the best we can to fit in, but things don't always end up the way we intend.Rules by Cynthia Lord 4\\\\. Always stick with family no matter what. 5\\\\. Even the best of us can't stick to their own rules. Inspiration Lord has two children, a son, and a daughter, and was inspired by them while writing Rules. She states that the character of David is loosely based on her autistic son, while the character of Catherine is a mixture of herself and her daughter, who loves to draw. Most of the characters and incidents come from a very personal place in Lord's life, including the character of Jason, who was very loosely inspired by an experience she had as a kid while watching a child in a wheelchair communicating with his mother. The Q&A; following the end of the book welcomes the reader with these words when asked where the idea for Rules came from: \\"I have two children, a daughter, and a son, and my son has autism. One day when my daughter was about ten years old, she asked me, \\"Mom, how come I never see families like mine in books and on TV?\\" I didn't know how to answer her, so I went looking for children's books that included characters with severe special needs. I did find some, but most of the books I read seemed very sad to me. Sadness is part of living with someone with a severe disability, but it's only one part. It can also be funny, inspiring, heartwarming, disappointing, frustrating‚Äîeverything that it is to love anyone and to live in any family.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Cynthia Lord's website Category:2006 American novels Category:American children's novels Category:Newbery Honor-winning works Category:Books about autism Category:2006 children's books Category:2006 debut novels ","title":"Rules (novel)"},{"id":"10070435","text":"Sebastian is the 2006 debut album from Swedish Pop/Rock singer Sebastian Karlsson, led by the first single and four weeks No. 1 hit \\"Do What You're Told\\".

It is named after the mineralogist Herbert Smith (1872‚Äì1953) and was first found in 1972 in Chile. It is polymorphous with kapellasite and closely related to paratacamite. Herbertsmithite is generally found in and around Anarak, Iran, hence its other name, anarakite. Herbertsmithite is associated with copper mineralizations in syenitic porphyries and granites in Chile and in Triassic dolomite formations in Iran. It has also been reported from the Osborn District in the Big Horn Mountains of Maricopa County, Arizona and the Lavrion District Mines of Attica, Greece. Herbertsmithite has a vitreous luster and is fairly transparent with a light-green to blue green color. Herbertsmithite has a Mohs hardness of between 3 and 3.5 and is known to have a brittle tenacity. The crystal's density has been calculated at 3.76 g/cm3. Herbertsmithite, in a pure synthetic form, was discovered in 2012 to be able to exhibit the properties of a quantum spin liquid, a generalized form of strongly correlated quantum spin liquid due to its Kagome lattice structure. Herbertsmithite is the first mineral known to exhibit this unique state of magnetism: it is neither a ferromagnet with mostly aligned magnetic particles, nor is it an antiferromagnet with mostly opposed adjacent magnetic particles; rather its magnetic particles have constantly fluctuating scattered orientations. Optical conductivity observations suggest the magnetic state in herbertsmithite is a type of emergent gauge field of a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid. Other experiments and some numerical calculations suggest instead that it is a \\\\mathbb{Z}_2 spin liquid (or in other words, has a \\\\mathbb{Z}_2 topological order).

Life Alexander Lindsay was the son of David Lindsay, 3rd Earl of Crawford and Marjory Ogilvie, the daughter of Sir Alexander Ogilvie of Auchterhouse. Paul, James Balfour, \\"The Scots peerage : founded on Wood's ed. of Sir Robert Douglas's Peerage of Scotland; containing an historical and genealogical account of the nobility of that kingdom\\", 9Edinburgh, David Douglas, 1906), Vol. III, pp. 18-21 Known as the Tiger Earl or Earl Beardie, Crawford was one of the most powerful of the Scottish nobles. For some time he was in arms against King James II as part of the Douglas rebellion. In February 1452, William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas was personally killed at Stirling Castle by James II for refusing to dissolve his league with Alexander. The Tiger Earl was defeated at the Battle of Brechin on 18 May, and he submitted to James II in 1452. J. B. Burke imagined the colorful scene of the earl's submission, thus: > The decree of forfeiture, both as to life and lands, which had been passed > before, was now renewed and, after having gallantly struggled for a long > time against all odds‚Äîeven after the total defeat and submission of his ally > Douglas‚Äîhe found himself compelled, for the sake of his house and followers, > to sue for mercy. In this last extremity it is that all the better parts of > his character stand out in full relief; there is neither fear, nor meanness, > nor self seeking in his frank and manly prayers for mercy: but, mingled with > the courage that we might reasonably look for, is a tenderness for others > that we certainly did not expect to find in such a character. For himself, > as he boldly tells the king, he was willing to underlie any fate, ‚Äúeither to > be hangit [hanged], to be riven with wild beasts, to be drowned, or cassen > [cast] over ane craig;‚Äù it was not even the sufferings of his dear wife, nor > the weeping of his bairns [children], nor the lamentable sobbings of his > friends that moved him, so much ‚Äúas the decay and falling of our House, and > lamentable chance and fortune of the noblemen of Angus, with the rest of my > adherents, whose lives, lands, and guids [goods] stands in danger for my > cause and surname of Lindsay. Have compassion on the noblemen, men that > concordit to my faction, that they, at the least, be not spoilzied (spoiled) > of their lives and heritages for my offence.‚Äù The king granted Lindsay clemency, but when he had been angry with the earl, he had sworn he would make the highest stone on Finavon Castle become the lowest. Therefore, to keep his oath while yet remaining true to his grant of clemency, the king climbed to the top of the castle and threw one of the loose stones on the battlements down to the ground below. J. B. Burke recorded that two hundred years later it could still be seen where it had fallen ‚Äúsecured to the spot with a strong chain of iron.‚Äù Legend has it that he is the infamous \\"Earl Beardie\\" featured in one of the myths of Glamis Castle.

It satirizes right extremist parties, especially the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD). In the style of former and existing right extremist organisational structures it is subdivided into numerous sub-groups like the youth organisation Nationales Frischobst Deutschland (NFD; National Fresh Fruit of Germany), the women's organisation Bund weicher Birnen (B.W.B.; League of Soft Pears, compare League of German Girls; Birne, pear, is a German colloquial term for head, \\"eine weiche Birne haben\\" (\\"to have a soft pear\\"), is synonymous to \\"being very stupid\\") and many further local Gaue.  Platform  Apple Front activists in typical uniform with satirized right extremist symbols and bearing The Apple Front argues in favour of political requirements for purification of the German fruit crop. The organisation describes itself as \\"Nationale Initiative gegen die √úberfremdung des deutschen Obstbestandes und gegen faul herumlungerndes Fallobst\\" - translated \\"National initiative against the overforeignization of German fruit crop and against lazy/rotten mooching fallen fruit\\" (faul means both lazy and rotten). The key demands of the organisation are: # Termination of the overforeignisation of German fruit by engrafting of foreign species. # Closing the borders against tropical fruits (\\"Grenzen dicht f√ºr Fremdobst!\\" - English \\"Close the borders against foreign fruit!\\"). # Elimination of lazy/rotten (compare faul above) windfall (\\"Macht Fallobst zu Mus!\\" - English \\"Make windfall to mush!\\"). The Apfelfront tries to use overly Germanized terminology in press releases and statements, at public demonstrations and on their website just like original right and extreme right internet services, and mimics the public appearance of the NSDAP and modern right extremist organisations. Therefore \\"homepage\\" is called \\"Heimseite\\", \\"webpage\\" is named \\"Weltnetzseite\\"' and \\"bulletin board/forum\\" is turned into \\"Brett\\" (all three English terms are common in current German usage; the translated/transformed German terms are commonly perceived as xenophobic or at least ridiculous in context of information technology). Particular terms, slogans and rhetorical devices used by the NPD and especially by Holger Apfel, their chairperson in the Landtag of Saxony, such as \\"Grenzen dicht!\\" (\\"Close the borders!\\") are picked up by the Apple Front and get used overly explicitly but are changed in their political message to orcharding and fruit utilization in order to make the original political statements and their representatives appear ridiculous.  History and activities  The Front Deutscher √Ñpfel was founded shortly after the Saxon election of 19 September 2004. The group, and Alf Thum, its founder, considers itself not as leftist but as non-right. They consider themselves to be artists who are trying to break away from the demonstration- counterdemonstration ritual. The Front's youth organisation (most German political parties have active youth organisations) is called Nationales Frischobst Deutschlands (National Fresh Fruit of Germany). The Bund weicher Birnen (League of Soft Pears/Heads) is affiliated with them in their national struggle. Since its founding, the Apfelfront has attended all larger NPD and neo-nazi marches/parades, especially in Eastern Germany. They have also got involved with Berlin 05, a youth politics festival sponsored by the German federal government. The Apfelfront has also been represented in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern since August 2006. Commentary Disruptions occasionally arise after an appearance by the Apfelfront, especially as the flags and symbols are not always immediately recognised as a parody. Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk published an article about the NPD on 25 July 2006, in which it portrayed a photo of the Apfelfront, with a subtitle, \\"The NPD wants to distance itself from its image of violence\\". The mistake was soon noticed, and the picture was removed.

Arnowitt was a Distinguished Professor (Emeritus) at Texas A&M; University, where he was a member of the Department of Physics. His research interests were centered on supersymmetry and supergravity, from phenomenology (namely how to find evidence for supersymmetry at current and planned particle accelerators or in the guise of dark matter) to more theoretical questions of string and M theory.Arnowitt's homepage at Texas A&M; In the context of general relativity, he was best known for his development (with Stanley Deser and Charles Misner) of the ADM formalism, roughly speaking a way of describing spacetime as space evolving in time, which allows a recasting of Einstein's theory in terms of a more general formalism used in physics to describe dynamical systems, namely the Hamiltonian formalism. In the framework of that formalism, there is also a straightforward way to globally define quantities like energy or, equivalently, mass (so-called ADM mass/energy) which, in general relativity, is not trivial at all. Arnowitt was also known for his work (with Ali Chamseddine and Pran Nath) which developed the theory of supergravity grand unification (with gravity mediated breaking). This work allowed for the unification of the three forces of microscopic physics at a very high mass scale (a result subsequently indirectly verified at the CERN LEP accelerator). The simplest version, called mSUGRA, is now commonly used to search for new physics at high energy accelerators. In addition, Arnowitt's work (with Marvin Girardeau) on many body theory of liquid Helium has stimulated many applications in that field.

Established in 1984 by K.V. Stanley and M.L. Parashuram and registered officially in 1993, their rescue operations cover South India. The rehabilitation center is set up in Mysore in Karnataka. Stanly and Parashu, as they are known popularly, were government officials and district coordinators of the Total Literacy Project, who, while interacting with villagers in the Mysore district, came across women who were ignored and shunned because they were sex workers. This led them to give up their jobs and start the Odanadi Seva Samasthe. Activities Since its establishment, Odanadi Seva Samasthe has organised and undertaken over a dozen rescue- operations, propelled by the active involvement of sex workers. More than 400 girls in and around the state of Karnataka have been rescued, and the perpetrators of this traffic have been brought to book. The Trust currently houses 75 rescued children, with the intention of protecting them from the clutches of the sex-trade. They have also been successful in having (over 22) women, that were once part of the trade, marry and settle. The goals of the program include providing shelter, food, education, vocational training, health care and counseling for its residents and creating awareness and influencing policy making related to anti-trafficking. The founders and their team also have awareness programs designed solely to eradicate the stigma associated with women of the flesh trade. The trust conducts several activities oriented towards shoring up its residents ‚Äòmoral‚Äô infrastructure including cultural capsules, meditation, recreation, group activities and training. The activities of Odanadi Seva Samasthe have been recognised by the state and the central governments. The Government of Karnataka has allotted two plots of land in Mysore for the rehabilitation of women and children in prostitution. Other state governments (Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal) have been sending rescued girls to Odanadi, to facilitate their rehabilitation. Odanadi has consistently received support from NGO's and not-for-profit organisations like AID (Association for India's Development), Asha for Education and Pratham. Asha for Education runs a program titled 'Support a Child' where donors choose to support a child, get to track the progress of that child and interact via letters. The program has received ample support for the children of Odanadi and continues to have the residents participation. The trust has participated in promoting rural education and social awareness in Kodagu District on tie up with sandeepany vidya peeta, somwarpet.

The Sacro Monte di Crea (literally \\"Sacred Mountain of Crea\\", although it is built on a hill rather than a mountain) is a Roman Catholic sanctuary in the comune of Serralunga di Crea, Piedmont, northern Italy. It is reached via a steeply ascending route which winds through a wooded natural park, whose flora where catalogued by the Casalese photographer and polymath Francesco Negri.  History  Construction began in 1589, around an existing sanctuary dedicated to the Virgin Mary whose creation is traditionally attributed to Saint Eusebius of Vercelli, around 350 AD. Eusebius is also said to have installed the statue of the Madonna which is still venerated in the sanctuary. The chapels dedicated to the Mysteries of the Rosary were positioned around the one-thousand-year-old Marian sanctuary on the highest of the hills of Basso Monferrato . As time passed the initial scheme of the monumental layout was altered on a number of occasions and in 1820 significant restoration work began after its partial destruction. The park Since 1980, woods and a few agricultural land surrounding the Sacro Monte have been preserved as the Parco naturale del Sacro Monte di Crea, whose area is where visitors can admire some plant species no longer widely found elsewhere.Ministero dell'Ambiente e della Tutela del Territorio e del Mare, Elenco ufficiale delle aree protette (EUAP) - 5¬∫ Aggiornamento approvato con Delibera della Conferenza Stato Regioni del 24 luglio 2003; published on the Supplemento ordinario n. 144 of the Gazzetta Ufficiale n. 205 of September 4th 2003.

It existed from 1998 to 2003 and released recordings by MF Doom, Blackalicious and KMD, among others. History The label was dedicated to underground, conscious hip-hop and was started by Bigg Jus, one of the founders of the underground NYC group Company Flow of Rawkus Records, Peter Lupoff, an entertainment investor, and Fiona Bloom, hip-hop publicist and then label manager of the hip-hop label 3-2-1 Records. Sub Verse was launched in 1998 and released artists such as Blackalicious, Rubberroom, Scienz of Life, KMD, MF Doom, Micranots, C-Rayz Walz and Bigg Jus. Their records were distributed worldwide through EMI and received critical acclaim.[] Though Sub Verse came very close to getting bought or invested in by MCA, with the industry in decline the label eventually ran out of money and could not put out records that would at least make the cost back. The events of 9/11 also took their toll on the morale and the financial fortunes of the NY company. These factors occurred just as Sub Verse's music started to become more broadly accessible, with releases by MF DOOM, the important release of KMD's Bl ck B st rds, and LPs and singles by some up and coming artists such as C-Rayz Walz, BukueOne, Tariq L and DMS. Sub Verse put out its last release, a compilation called \\"Seditious Jewels\\", in 2003. Sub Verse Music supported the underground hip-hop scene in NYC and to a degree, the larger cities in the US with shows in New York, regularly at The Knitting Factory for instance. The label had a separate entity, called \\"Subversive Skool\\", run by Fiona Bloom with Peter Lupoff, that brought underground artists from outside NYC to New York. Shows were headlined by the \\"star\\", usually had another NYC local notable and one or two Sub Verse artists or prospects. It was sponsored by 555 Soul and Eck≈ç Unltd., among others. The label also gave CDs, vinyl, T-shirts, other Sub Verse gear and their time and effort to support causes like hip-hop education (at the Brooklyn Museum), the Hip-Hop Film Festival, and Tolerance.org. People C-Rayz Walz was known as one of the top battle MCs in NY. While label co-founder Bigg Jus had a view of a more dusty underground sound, C-Rayz was friendly with Lupoff and later with Bloom. He was a stalwart of the shows produced by Sub Verse' Subversive Skool unit and was later the battle MC and teacher on an MTV episode of \\"Made\\" in which a kid strives to be a battle MC. MF Doom turned to Sub Verse after Fondle 'Em Records closed up shop. After his meeting up with Bigg Jus in ATL, Sub Verse re-mastered and re-released his Operation: Doomsday with a new track: \\"I Hear Voices Part I\\" . A Flash video for this track won gold in the International Design Excellence Awards in 2001. Sub Verse also released the shelved Bl ck B st rds, recorded for Elektra with his old group KMD. Bigg Jus came to hip-hop through graffiti. Through his skills he became acquainted with El-P, an up-and-coming underground MC. The two lived together a while, and joined with Mr. Len to form the seminal NYC underground squad, Company Flow. BukueOne was a graf, skateboard, and, oddly, duckpin bowling fiend. His graffiti covered whole walls in the Sub Verse office in Tribeca. Bukue set his own course always and only looked to Sub Verse to help him get around the world and back in exchange for recordings. Bukue is affiliated loosely with the Hieroglyphics crew, having grown up in Oakland and tour managed them often. Fiona Bloom is a British, classically trained pianist who won classical music scholarships to the U.S. and fell in love with hip hop. She worked at radio stations in ATL, then for EMI, and then ran 3-2-1 Records, a fledgling hip-hop label and source of early Sub Verse recordings. Peter Lupoff is a Wall Street investor, entertainment banker and venture capitalist. But it is little known that early on, he was part of a hip-hop group with live instruments that played around NYC; their group opened for Kool Moe Dee, Slick Rick and others, and in the 90's Peter ghostwrote lyrics for better known artists struck with writer's block. He was known to labels as \\"the cleaner\\", for his ability to clean up botched projects, and to others as \\"Stylin' Pete Style\\", for his dressy apparel. Opuriche \\"OP\\" Miller is a current DJ on the scenes in NYC and South Africa. OP started out as an employee at Sub Verse, focused on marketing and processing recordings from initial recording to release. Eventually, when many left Sub Verse after 911, his music aesthetic was the direction Sub Verse wanted to go and OP was largely the A&R; person in the waning years. OP is actively involved in major hip-hop releases on the distribution side to this day. Sub Verse had many interns come through their shop in the years 1998-2003, many are now actively involved in music, management, distribution and marketing.

She was a recipient of the S.E.A. Write Award. Biography She was born in Toledo, Cebu, the fifth child and second daughter of Yrinea Regner and Gerundio Espina. Her formative academic years were spent at the Cebu Central School and at the Cebu Intermediate High School. She then graduated from the Southern Colleges with an Associate of Arts degree. A brief stint as a law student at Far Eastern University in Manila was followed by a job as a cub reporter for the Manila Times./The History of Filipino Women's Writings], retrieved on: September 21, 2012 Among her awards are the Philippines Free Press Literary Award for 1994, when she won first prize in the short story contest and for her ‚Äúoutstanding contribution to Philippine arts and letters.‚Äù She was also the ‚Äúunanimous choice‚Äù by the Creative Writing Center at the University of the Philippines for the 1995-96 National Fellowship in Literature, an honor she couldn't accept because of health reasons. Along with other female reporters, Espina established the Philippine Association of Women Writers (PAWW) in 1950. While in this group, Espina's Just Like A Dream was published in the Graphic; it was her first fiction piece to see the light of day in a regionally-circulated magazine. This was followed by the Sunday Times Magazine's publication of her Timeless Waters. While more of her stories began making the rounds of other magazines, Espina flitted from one writing job to the next, running the gamut of editorial work, ghost writing and public relations. With many writing successes in English under her belt, Espina decided to pen manuscripts in her native Cebuano and send these to Liwayway Publications‚Äô Cebuano magazine Bisaya. Previous awards include: Outstanding Achievement in the Field of English Literature from the Province of Cebu (1975), Pan Pacific Southeast Asian Association Award in the Field of the English Novel (1975), Magsusulat Award for Exemplary Contribution to Literature in Cebuano (1987), and the much-esteemed Thailand Southeast Asian Write Award presented by HRH Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn for her novel Heart of the Lotus in 1989.

It features individual frames of six planets and a partial background indicating their relative positions. The picture is a mosaic of 60 individual frames. The frames used to compose the image were the last photographs taken by either Voyager spacecraft (which continued to relay other telemetry afterward). These frames were also the source of the famous Pale Blue Dot image of the Earth. Astronomer Carl Sagan, who was part of the Voyager imaging team, campaigned for many years to have the pictures taken. Description Diagram of the Family Portrait showing the planets' orbits and the relative position of Voyager 1 when the mosaic was captured. Position of Voyager 1 above the plane of the ecliptic on February 14, 1990 Six planets are visible in the mosaic, from left to right: Jupiter, Earth, Venus, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. The Sun, also a point of light at this distance, is included in the image. Three (then) planets were missed. Mercury was too close to the Sun to be seen. Mars could not be detected by the Voyager cameras due to its position resulting in it only producing a thin crescent from the viewpoint of the spacecraft and Pluto (which in 1990 was still considered a planet) was not included because its small size and distance from the Sun left it too dim to image. Mars could have been imaged through a clear filter rather than the coloured ones used but by the time this was realised the process was too far advanced to make the changes. The image does not have a unified appearance. The individual frames were acquired using various filters at varying exposures to bring out as much detail as possible in each. For example, the Sun was imaged with the darkest filter and shortest exposure available, to avoid damaging the Imaging Science System vidicon tubes. The majority of the frames were acquired in gray scale with the probe's Wide-Angle Camera, while the close-up views of each planet were acquired in color using the Narrow-Angle Camera. The image was acquired at a distance of approximately from Earth and approximately 32¬∞ above the ecliptic plane. Of the two Voyager spacecraft, Voyager 1 was chosen to create the mosaic because its trajectory had taken it above the plane of the Solar System, and unlike Voyager 2, was in a position to view Jupiter free of light disturbances by the Sun's glare. In 2013, a reverse image was taken of Voyager 1, using radio telescopes. Voyager 1 cannot be seen in visible light, but its radio signal is very bright compared to most natural things studied by radio telescopes.

It was created by Toshihiro Hirano, director of the original Fight! Iczer One and Iczer Reborn series. AIC and KSS were the animation production companies in charge of Iczelion. The series was licensed by in North America in August 1995 by ADV Films. Unlike its predecessor, Iczelion did not feature female- female intimacy. Although the series hinted at a possible continuation, none was ever written or created. The story seems to take place in an alternate timeline from Iczer-One and Iczer Reborn because of its placement in modern- day and with a seemingly different Nagisa. Iczelion was also made into a radio drama series, released as three drama CDs. The radio drama served as a bridge between Iczer-3 and Iczelion, as characters from the Iczer-3 OVA series were featured in it, including Nagisa Kasumi, who became the title Iczelion instead of the OVA's Nagisa Kai. Iczel was also sent to earth by Iczer-3 in the radio drama. Story Kai Nagisa, a normal high school girl who wishes to one day become a professional wrestler, is suddenly approached by a robot known as an Iczel. Iczel urges her to help save the Earth from invading aliens called Geas. The Geas, led by Chaos and Cross, are bent on stripping Earth's resources and then destroying it. To fight the invaders, Nagisa must merge with Iczel and become a battle-suited warrior named \\"Iczelion\\". She is reluctant to take up this sudden unbelievable task and fight with the other Iczelions of Earth because Nagisa just wants to live a normal life without having such big responsibilities. Nagisa must overcome her fears and fight, together with other Iczelions, to prevent the invading alien forces from destroying their home planet, Earth. Characters=Main Characters * : :A normal high school student who wishes to become a professional wrestler.

There are other Iczels on Earth that attend to their own Iczelions; Iczel Black, Iczel Gold, and Iczel Silver. Each Iczel has their own personality, which is similar to that of their Iczelion girl counterpart. Iczel is also referred to as Normal Type by the other Iczels. Weapon: Barrier. * : :A rock singer and works as a rave dancer in a nightclub, she is . From all the Iczelion, she is the most direct and sure of herself. Her Iczelion signature attacks are gravity based, and she is also the most skilled with both her beam sword and in hand to hand combat.

It was directed by Rituparno Ghosh in 2003 and stars Aishwarya Rai as Binodini and Raima Sen as Ashalata. Ashalata and Binodini refer to each other as Chokher Bali. The other major characters are played by Prosenjit Chatterjee as Mahendra, Lily Chakravarty as Rajlakshmi, the mother of Mahendra, Tota Roy Chowdhury as Behari, Rajlakshmi's adopted son and Swastika Mukherjee in a cameo role. The film was later dubbed into Hindi and was released internationally in that language. Upon release, Chokher Bali met with critical review and positive box office reception. Chokher Bali won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali and was nominated for the Golden Leopard (Best Film) award at the Locarno International Film Festival in 2003. The film screened at the 34th International Film Festival of India on 19 October. It was the Official Selection at the Chicago International Film Festival in 2003 and was showcased in over 25 international festivals including the Toronto International Film Festival, London Film Festival, Palm Springs, Karlovy Vary and Washington DC International Film Festival besides winning the Apsara Film Producers' Award for the Best Regional Film 2004. Aishwarya Rai had won the Best Actress award at the Anandalok Awards 2003. Plot Binodini is a young girl who is left to her own devices when her sickly husband dies soon after their marriage. She returns to her village and lives there for a couple of months until she sees one of her aunts passing by. Binodini hails the woman and her two sons agree that it would be best if Binodini came to live with the woman and her son, Mahendra. But that son, Mahendra, was one of the first to see Binodini's photo when she was proposed as a prospective wife for him, yet refused her on account of his being \\"unready for marriage.\\" When Binodini arrives with her aunt, Mahendra and his new bride are constantly sneaking off to be alone together. This infatuation does not last long, however, and Mahendra soon begins to see that Binodini is more his type. Mahendra and Binodini, start an affair, and this is soon revealed to Ashalata, who, unaware of her pregnancy, leaves for Kashi. Binodini, after realising that Mahendra is self-obsessed, leaves Mahendra's house. She pleads with Behari to marry her, but Behari, true to his values, rejects her offer. Binodini leaves the town for her village. She writes a letter to Behari that she'll be waiting for him in Kashi. As she is leaving for Kashi, Mahendra comes to mend their relations, which she refuses. Instead she makes him promise to take her to Behari. At Kashi, Binodini meets Behari who, after some incidents, agrees to marry her. On the day of marriage Binodini vanishes, leaving a letter for Asha. The story details the lives of these three and Mahendra's best friend as they deal with issues such as distrust, adultery, lies, and falling-out.  Music  The film's background score is by Debojyoti Mishra and, notably, it contains no playback singing. Sreela Majumdar dubbed for Aishwarya Rai and Sudipta Chakraborty dubbed for Raima Sen.  Culture  In olden days in Bengal, women and girls who were best friends would often set a common nickname for themselves and address each other by that name. In this story, two friends Binodini and Ashalata call each other 'Chokher Bali.'

Ekanshu Khera of Planet Bollywood gave the film an 8/10. He found the cinematography to be beautiful and was pleased that the singing was not lip synched. However, he said that the \\"dubbing leaves much to be desired\\" and would have preferred a different director dub it in Hindi. He also noted that the film appeals \\"to a niche audience due to its periodic settings and ideologies.\\" Margaret Pomeranz of ABC Australia gave it 3 out of 5 stars, saying that \\"the insight it gives into Indian culture and customs, is interesting and that tends to overcome the slight impatience with the overload of emotions.\\" David Stratton, also of ABC, gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting on how the film version was edited 40 minutes shorter but that it was beautifully acted and fascinating.https://web.archive.org/web/20150113041857/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s1392583.htm Box office The film was declared a hit at the box office.

He represented Amersham and Huntingdonshire in the House of Commons. The title became extinct on his death in 1689. Proby's first cousin William Proby was the ancestor of the Earls of Carysfort.

The line currently runs from the State Center Metro Subway Station to the intersection of Harford Road and Northern Parkway. From there it splits into two branches. About one half of buses continue operating along Harford Road to the Carney Park-and-Ride just north of the I-695 interchange, and the other half to the intersection of Goucher Boulevard and Taylor Avenue in Towson via Northern, McLean Boulevard, Hillsway, and Taylor. The line serves the communities of Montebello, Hamilton, and Parkville. The bus route is the successor to the 19 Harford Avenue streetcar line. History A historic No. 19 streetcar at the Baltimore Streetcar Museum Route 19 was electrified as a streetcar along Harford Road in 1894. The line terminated in the north in Parkville and did not serve Carney. Service between Parkville and Carney was provided by Bus Route R from 1936 to 1948,http://www.btco.net/Routes/routelet.htmhttp://www.btco.net/Routes/map53r.gif and by Bus Route 53 from 1948 to 1956.http://www.btco.net/Routes/route5.htm The no. 19 line started providing service to Carney when it was converted to a bus in 1956. In 1952, it was combined with the no. 31 streetcar, and extended to serve the corridor of Garrison Boulevard in West Baltimore. In 1956, the operation was converted to rubber tire buses. Over the next few decades, the line was expanded. The route was extended along Belvedere Avenue to Sinai Hospital and north to the Carney Park-and-Ride, and branches were formed to Northern Parkway and McLean Boulevard, Walther Avenue, Joppa Heights, and the Hickey School. Also, express trips operated via I-95. In 1987, Route 19 was split into two lines in order to improve schedule adherence on both sides of town. The new Route 19 ran from State Center north of downtown Baltimore, and the line served the Harford Road corridor. The new Route 91 operated from Sinai Hospital to City Hall, serving the western half of this route. During the 1990s, the following changes were made to Route 19: *The McLean branch was extended to Goucher & Taylor, overlapping with a portion of Route 55. It was also made into a full-time service. *The Walther Avenue branch was discontinued. *Express trips via I-95 were discontinued. Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a comprehensive overhaul plan for the region's transit system, MTA first proposed to eliminate the Joppa Heights and Hickey School branches. No changes to this line were implemented along with Phase I in 2005. In 2006, a two revised plans were introduced. The first was to likewise shorten the line to Lexington Market. But a new revised plan was introduced later in 2006 in which the line would be split into two separate lines. One line, which would have retained the no. 19 designation, would have continued to operate from Carney to State Center, with a minor routing change in the downtown area, and would have operated every 30 minutes at most times. The other would have been known as Route 37, and would have operated from Goucher & Taylor to Cherry Hill via the current route downtown, then via the route of Route 27 the remainder of the way. These two lines would operate on an alternating basis with coordinated schedules between Northern & Harford and downtown Baltimore. These changes were not implemented, and GBBI was canceled in 2007. But the Joppa Heights and Hickey School branches were later eliminated in 2009, with no other changes to the route. Route 19A In 1973, a new Route 19A was introduced that also originated at the Carney Park-and-Ride, and operated to Downtown Baltimore via a different route. It was a replacement for a route previously provided by the defunct McMahon Services. The line provided one morning trip between Carney and downtown, and one evening trip from downtown to Carney. It operated to points on Harford Road north of the Park-and-Ride lot, serving the Cub Hill area, and then followed Old Harford Road and shorter sections of other thoroughfares in Parkville and Towson not served by other bus service prior to reaching Charles Street in the Rodgers Forge area. From there, it continued directly downtown. The line was renamed Route 105 in 2000., In October 2005, Route 105 was discontinued due to its low ridership.http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/howard/bal- te.md.routes14jun14,1,5997450.story No replacement service was formed.

But the fact that his father married Elizabeth Hay after 18 Aug 1471 [CP, vi, 677 & n. b.] and that Alexander himself was a member of parliament, as well as being one of the Lords of the Articles in 1485, makes it chronologically implausible he could have been Elizabeth Hay's son; meaning most probably his mother was Annabella Stewart.

This can be seen in signal transduction of hormone messages. phosphorylation and dephosphorylation summary A signaling pathway begins at the cell surface where a hormone or protein binds to a receptor at the Extracellular matrix. The interactions between the molecule and receptor causes a Conformational change at the receptor, which activates multiple enzymes or proteins. These enzymes activates secondary messengers that leads to the phosphorylation of thousands of proteins. The end product of Phosphorylation cascade is the changes occurring inside the cell. One best example that explains this phenomena is mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase or ERK kinase. MAP kinase not only plays an important function during growth of cell in the M phase phosphorylation cascade but also plays an important role during the sequence of signaling pathway. In order to regulate its functions so it does not cause chaos, it can only be active when both tyrosine and threonine/serine residues are phosphorylated.

It is the second installment in the Alex Cross film series and a sequel to the 1997 film Kiss the Girls, with Morgan Freeman and Jay O. Sanders reprising their roles as detective Alex Cross and FBI-agent Kyle Craig. The screenplay by Marc Moss was adapted from the 1993 novel of the same title by James Patterson, but many of the key plot elements of the book were controversially eliminated. The film was a box office success. It received mixed reviews from critics. Plot After Washington, D.C., detective forensic psychologist and author Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) loses control of a sting operation, resulting in the death of his partner, he retires from the force. He finds himself drawn back to police work when Megan Rose (Mika Boorem), the daughter of a United States senator, is kidnapped from her exclusive private school by computer science teacher Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott). US Secret Service Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter), held responsible for the breach in security, joins forces with Cross to find the missing girl. This was only after Cross stood up for her, making her boss realize she was a material witness. Soneji contacts Cross by phone and alerts him to the fact one of Megan's sneakers is in the detective's mailbox, proving that Soneji is the kidnapper. Cross deduces that the man is obsessed with the 1932 Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. kidnapping and hopes to become as infamous as Bruno Hauptmann by committing a new \\"Crime of the Century\\" which might be discussed by Cross in one of his true crime books. Megan's kidnapping proves to be only part of Soneji's real plan: to kidnap Dimitri Starodubov (Anton Yelchin), the son of the Russian president, guaranteeing himself greater infamy. After Cross and Flannigan foil his second kidnapping plot, a supposed call from the kidnapper demands that Cross deliver a ransom of $10 million in diamonds, by following an intricate maze of calls made to public phone booths scattered throughout the city. Following the ransom directions, Cross ultimately tosses the gems out the window of a rapidly moving Metro train to a figure standing by the tracks. Soneji later arrives at Flannigan's home and confronts Cross after disabling Flannigan with a taser. Because Soneji has not reacted to Cross's verbal comment about receiving the ransom amount (which was incorrect), the detective realizes that the kidnapper is unaware of the ransom demand and delivery. Soneji tries to leave with Flannigan, but Cross kills him. Cross becomes suspicious and realizes that someone else discovered Soneji long before his plot came to fruition. After searching Flannigan's personal computer, he finds enough evidence to prove that Flannigan and her fellow Secret Service agent Ben Devine (Billy Burke) used Soneji as a pawn in their own plot to collect a ransom for Megan. He tracks them down to a secluded farmhouse, where Flannigan has murdered Devine and is now intent on killing Megan. Cross stops Flannigan by shooting her in the heart, killing her. Cross kneels before the nervous Megan to introduce himself as a policeman and her parents' friend. She asks if he can take her home to them, and he assures her that nothing would make him happier. Cast * Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross * Monica Potter as Jezzie Flannigan * Michael Wincott as Gary Soneji/The Spider * Dylan Baker as Ollie McArthur * Mika Boorem as Megan Rose * Billy Burke as Ben Devine * Anton Yelchin as Dimitri Starodubov * Jay O. Sanders as Kyle Craig * Michael Moriarty as Senator Hank Rose * Penelope Ann Miller as Elizabeth Rose * Anna Maria Horsford as Vickie Production=Writing One of the primary elements of the book screenwriter Marc Moss eliminated from his script was the fact that Soneji is actually a mild-mannered suburban husband and father suffering from dissociative identity disorder resulting from having been abused as a child. After a lengthy trial for kidnapping and several murders not included in the film, he is found guilty but remanded to a mental institution to serve his sentence. Also missing from the film is a romantic relationship shared by Cross and Jezzie, her trial and eventual execution by lethal injection, and the discovery of Megan (Maggie as she is known in the book), hidden away with a native Bolivian family near the Andes Mountains, two years after her kidnapping. A few other minor differences from the original book include: Dimitri (Michael \\"Shrimpie\\" Goldberg as referred to in the book) being kidnapped at the same time as Megan (Maggie); Megan's (Maggie's) mother was the more famous of her parents, being a popular actress; when the children are kidnapped they are sprayed with chloroform spray. Reception=Box office Box office receipts totaled US$105,178,561, of which $74,078,174 was from the United States having earned US$16,712,407 in its opening weekend at 2,530 theaters. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 32% based on reviews from 126 critics. The site's critics consensus was \\"Derivative and contains too many implausible situations.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 42% based on reviews from 31 critics, indicting \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times called the film an \\"overplotted, hollow thriller, which crams in so much exposition that characters speak in fetid hunks for what seems like minutes at a time ... But Spider couldn't be better served than it is by Mr. Freeman, whose prickly smarts and silken impatience bring believability to a classless, underdeveloped thriller ... Still, he is wasted in this impersonal, almost inept thriller.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times gave the film a mixed 2 out of 4 stars, calling it \\"loophole-riddled, verging on the nonsensical\\". He wrote, \\"I'm wondering, since Dr. Alex Cross is so brilliant, how come he doesn't notice yawning logical holes in the very fabric of the story he's occupying?\\" Nonetheless, Ebert thought that Freeman's performance was commendable. \\"Maybe actors should be given Oscars,\\" he wrote, \\"not for the good films they triumph in, but for the weak films they survive.\\" Robert Koehler of Variety felt \\"the very characteristics that have made Cross so appealing, particularly his mind-tickling abilities to assess and outmaneuver his criminal opponents, are reduced here to the most fundamental and predictable level ... As reliable as any actor in Hollywood, Freeman delivers the requisite gravitas, but the bland script curtails any personal touches he might have inserted were his sleuth character unraveling a truly vexing mystery.\\" However, critic Harvey O'Brian weighed in with the sentiment that \\"Unlike, for example, the overblown kidnap movie Ransom, Along Came a Spider plays down its sensational elements. It favours the procedural aspects of Cross' investigation which, though infected with the usual 'Eureka' factor of brilliant discoveries by the leading man at regular intervals just when it looked like he was stumped, are largely delivered with sincerity. Freeman has such a strong grip on this kind of determined, middle aged, everyman character by now that he can easily take the audience along for the ride. The film itself is otherwise sincere in general, with no real attempt at smarmy black humour or winks to the audience. It draws you in to a (relatively) realistic depiction of a tense situation in which people behave less like action heroes and more like human beings.\\"http://homepage.eircom.net/~obrienh/acas.htm Compuserve‚Äôs Harvey Karten argued, \\"Some critics will tell you that despite Lee Tamahori's overplotting of Marc Moss's adaptation of James Patterson's novel, Along Came a Spider is one of those thrillers that allow you to check your brains at the door. Not true. Did the journalists all go for popcorn when Detective Alex Cross and Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan (nice spelling) engaged first in a discussion of psychology and then of philosophy? This may have been Phil 101, but imagine the interest that must have been aroused in the audience with a product placement for university education. Says Cross in discussing what makes us choose our careers: 'You do what you are.' 'Not so,' replies Jezzie, every hair in place, not one gram of makeup disturbed, despite the excitement of the discussion... 'You are what you do.'\\"https://www.imdb.com:80/reviews/281/28175.html Accolades Jerry Goldsmith won the BMI Film & TV Award for his original score, and Morgan Freeman was nominated for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture but lost to Denzel Washington for Training Day. Series reboot There were no further sequels, but the character of Alex Cross was rebooted with a 2012 film adaptation of the novel Cross under the title Alex Cross starring Tyler Perry in the titular role.

He grew up in Syracuse and attended SUNY Cortland in Cortland, New York where he majored in fine arts and minored in theatre. He has had a varied career in entertainment. Early in his career he worked on several projects for Comedy Central, VH1 and Nickelodeon. He was also a cast member on MTV's Damage Control and host of VH1's reality show Motormouth. He is best known for hosting Three Sheets, which ran on MOJO HD from 2006 through 2008, Fine Living channel in 2009 and the Travel Channel in 2010. He also hosted Have Fork, Will Travel, which previously ran on Food Network, a show similar to Three Sheets focusing on local food and eating customs. The February/March 2009 of Mutineer Magazine featured an extensive interview with Zane Lamprey, which highlighted Lamprey's views of fine beverage and the evolution of Three Sheets. Zane Lamprey appeared on the April/May 2009 cover of Mutineer Magazine, which also featured an exclusive behind the scenes look at Three Sheets with photos from Lamprey's personal collection. After Three Sheets, Zane Lamprey sought out to create Drinking Made Easy, a similar drinking and traveling show focused on American bars and drinks. Drinking Made Easy ran on AXS TV for three seasons and a total of 62 episodes until 2013. After the show's end, Zane and his loyal fans joined together to create a new crowd-funded travel and drinking show known as Chug. After raising $591,804, six hour-long episodes were created and was expected to be released in 2014. Zane Lamprey is the founder and CEO of Adv3nture, a premium travel and adventure clothing brand based out of Los Angeles, California. The Adv3nture Hoodie, which includes the brand's signature \\"beverage\\" pocket, became the most-funded fashion Kickstarter project at the time, with over $1.8 million pledged. As of 2020, all Adv3nture products are made in America. Zane is also the founder of Monkey Rum, a rum beverage company with both spice and coconut rum products. Currently available in California, Florida, New York, and Texas. Media projects=Three Sheets Lamprey's first television project was an international travelogue/pub crawl series which initially aired on MOJO HD named Three Sheets. The format of the show featured Lamprey traveling abroad learning about the origin of regional drinks and their drinking customs. After MOJO HD ceased operations and went off the air on December 1, 2008, Zane worked to find a network to pick up Three Sheets. Several networks were approached about purchasing the series, including the successor to the MOJO HD network, the Screaming Flea Productions. On December 16, 2008, Lamprey hosted a rally to generate awareness of Three Sheets in an attempt to garner interest from other networks. The rally took place in Los Angeles, California and attracted approximately 400 people. A second rally on December 18, 2008 in New York City brought around 700 people. The chairman of HDNet, Mark Cuban was in attendance at the New York rally and expressed interest in acquiring the show. In 2008, Lamprey and then wife Jennifer Roa divorced. In 2012 he married Melissa (Mel) Schilling. In early 2009, Lamprey's official web site instructed visitors to return to the site on March 16, 2009 for an announcement regarding a network acquiring the rights to Three Sheets. However, the announcement instead stated: > \\"While I did get 'the call' from the production company that Three Sheets > has a new home, I've been told by MOJO HD that the deal is not yet done. > SO... I can't make the official announcement yet. Some people jumped the gun > by telling me that it was a done deal... That doesn't mean that it's not > going to happen-- that means that it IS. It just has to be lawyered first... > > I can tell you that I've even been told to get ready to shoot season five. > In fact, the 'official' announcement will probably happen this week. I'll > post it here on my web site the moment I get the nod from the network. But, > before you get frustrated and think that I didn't deliver... Read this... > > Although I have not spoken with the new network, or had them tell me not to > say anything, I'm opting to let them decide when and how to make the public > announcement. However, I did tell my close friends. And, one of those > friends, who I won't name (Steve McKenna) spilled the beans at the party. > So, if you're resource (and I know you are), a little fishing should leave > you satisfied. > > Salud!\\"http://www.zanelamprey.com Following up, Lamprey posted the following on his official website on March 18, 2009: > I've spoken with the new network, and they've asked that I personally make > the announcement Three Sheets will be gracing their network. But, they've > asked that I wait until the deal is done-- when they assure me is by the end > of this week, or early next week. So... Three Sheets is saved. And as soon > as I get the official nod, I'll post it here on my web site. In the > meantime, if you were at the party and heard Steve McKenna leak the news, > please refrain from posting the name of the new network here. I gotta > respect our new home. It'll only be a few days now. I promise! On May 2, 2009 Zane hosted \\"Zano De Mayo\\", later called the \\"We Saved Three Sheets\\" party. At the function it was announced that the Fine Living Network (FLN) had purchased Three Sheets. Three Sheets was originally to begin airing on FLN on Friday May 29, 2009 at 11:00pm and 11:30pm, but delays in the closure of the deal resulted in the premiere of the first two episodes of the nineteen-episode season being pushed to June 5, 2009. However, on June 2, 2009, Lamprey reported that the deal was still not complete. On June 22, FLN finally made the official announcement that Three Sheets would begin airing July 20, 2009 and would air new episodes each Monday with rerun episodes scheduled to run Tuesday through Friday. Lamprey said on his website that the likelihood of the show being picked up for a fifth season would depend on the ratings of Season 4, with a focus on the ratings of the premiere. In October 2009, it was announced that FLN would be re-branded as Cooking Channel, with content similar to their sister channel Food Network. Three Sheets was canceled from the re-branded network and Lamprey again began the search for a new network. Lamprey did find a home for Three Sheets on the Travel Channel for a brief stint in 2010 when fans flooded the Travel Channel's official Facebook page with support for the show. After one month, Travel Channel dropped Three Sheets from its lineup. In February 2011, Three Sheets again found a home on a new network with Spike TV. Spike aired the first seven episodes of the third season that originally aired on FLN, but no further episodes have been shown since. Despite being absent from the television network, Three Sheets was still listed on Spike TV's official website as late as November 2014. Drinking Made Easy With Zane Lamprey Comedy Tour In March 2010, Lamprey announced on his official website that he was taking his comedy tour on the road. His tour included comedian Marc Ryan (Three Sheets: Las Vegas) and his best friend and Three Sheets mainstay Steve McKenna. The \\"Drinking Made Easy\\" live show includes discussions of all things alcohol including production, consumption and intoxication. Drinking Made Easy With Zane Lamprey on HDNet/AXS TV On October 6, 2010, Lamprey premiered a new travelogue/pub-crawl show in the vein of Three Sheets on HDNet titled Drinking Made Easy. Like Three Sheets, Drinking Made Easy follows Lamprey, Steve McKenna and Marc Ryan as they travel across the country discovering local pubs, watering holes, breweries and distilleries. While Three Sheets focused on international fare and customs, Drinking Made Easy highlighted drinking cultures in the United States. Drinking Made Easy documents the various ways drinking customs have contributed to the United States' birth, growth, and distinction as the cast seek out the adult beverages, cultures, and mixology that are unique to America's cities. The first season comprised 24 episodes taking viewers on a road trip with Lamprey, McKenna, and Ryan as their tour bus logged over 10,000 miles of United States highways and roads beginning in Phoenix, AZ and circling the country back to its conclusion in Los Angeles. \\"Drinking Made Easy\\" Season 2 premiered on HDNet on October 5, 2011, continuing the format but including the satellite state of Hawaii as well as Canada border city Vancouver. Lamprey also became executive producer of the series through his production company, Inzane Entertainment. Marc Ryan did not return to the show. On July 2, 2012, HDNet was re-branded to AXS TV but Drinking Made Easy would remain part of the network with Season 3 premiering October 3, 2012. Season 3 continued where Season 2 left off, this time including Alaska and expanding the trip into Canada once again with stops in Montreal and the surrounding areas of Quebec. Three Sheets: Drinking Made Easy! Book Lamprey's book Three Sheets: Drinking Made Easy! was released on March 16, 2010. CHUG.tv CHUG! is the latest travel show from Zane Lamprey. Chug will follow Zane's journeys as he travels the world exploring the greatest drinking destinations.

He specializes in the Gnawa style. He is currently married to Chikako Iwahori. Early life Hakmoun was born to a family of musiciansThe gnawa-globetrotter - culturebase.net who introduced him to the musical world of the Gnawa. By age four, he performed alongside great masters of the Gnawa all over Morocco (including king of the Gnawa genre, master Sam) and in Casablanca for Lila. His mother is known throughout the city as a mystic healer. At the age of fourteen he became Master of Gnawa music.Biography of Hassan Hakmoun, www.hassanhakmoun.com Personal life In June 2002, Hakmoun married fellow musician Paula Cole, whom he had met on the Peter Gabriel ‚ÄúSecret World Live‚Äù tour in 1994. The couple divorced in 2007. They have one daughter, Sky, who was born in 2002. Career His mother is a mystic healer known in Marrakesh for her derdeba trance ceremonies, often all-night affairs involving hypnotic playing and chanting to exorcise spirits. Hakmoun began learning Gnawa music after witnessing his first trance ceremony at the young age of four. Hakmoun proceeded to study Gnawa music after a musical ceremony that healed his sister Mina Hakmoun. He eventually chose the sintir as his main instrument, a three-stringed lute with a body made of camel skin stretched over nutwood. The strings of the sintir are pitched low, enabling the instrument to serve as the bass foundation much like the Western string bass, while its tone is sweet, making it well-suited to carry the melodic line of a composition. By drumming on the body of the instrument, Hakmoun added his own percussion while contributing vocals, thereby creating a unique foundation for his musical explorations and growth. By the age of fourteen, he was an established musician performing at Gnawa lila ceremonies with his own ensemble. Today, Hakmoun is known as the godfather of Gnawa music. Later career Hakmoun made his U.S. debut in 1987 at Lincoln Center in New York City with Etian and Blanca Lee'‚Äôs Trio Gna & Nomadas dance group. He subsequently relocated to New York where he was received by artists such as composer and producer Richard Horowitz. and Peter Gabriel. He became a fixture in New York‚Äôs rock, jazz and fusion scenes, spanning multiple genres. In 1989 Hakmoun became part of the group Magmouat Hakmoun with his brother Said and relatives Mohammed Bechar and Abdel Hok Dahmad. Later that year, with help from Robert Browning and the World Music Institute, Hakmoun produced and released his debut album Fire Within, with Adam Rudolph and jazz trumpeter Don Cherry. Together they made a Gnawa jazz fusion recording, Gift of the Gnawa. Hakmoun began to expand his musical range, adding American sounds to the Moroccan form. This led him to form the group Zahar, meaning ‚Äòluck‚Äô, whose music fused elements of rock and jazz with African styles. With the ensemble, Hakmoun recorded his first album featuring electric instruments and continued to perform around New York City. One such instance occurred during a performance at the Knitting Factory, whose audience members included Miles Davis, and Daniel Lanois, who proceeded to introduce Hakmoun to an important future collaborator, pop musician Peter Gabriel. In 1992 Hakmoun joined Gabriel‚Äôs WOMAD, founded in 1980. Hakmoun released another album, Trance, at Gabriel's Real World Studios in Bath, England. From Bath, Hakmoun toured Europe, the Middle East and the U.S. along with other WOMAD artists, including performing under the group's auspices at the Woodstock 94 festival in 1994. His albums Fire Within, Gift of the Gnawa and Trance topped the charts for World Music Albums, World Music Charts Europe, New World and CMJ‚Äôs Radio Top 150 and were selected by Rolling Stone as one of the \\"Hot Picks of ‚Äô94. His powerful performances and sounds also resulted in letters of admiration from former New York City Mayor David Dinkins, television host Jay Leno and saxophonist David Sanborn, as well as from executives at the New York Times and the British Broadcasting Corporation. Later years (2002 present) In 2002 Hakmoun teamed up with American-born producer Fabian Alsultany to record a new album, The Gift. The album included the release of the single, \\"This Gift,\\" a duet with Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Paula Cole. In 2003 The Gift received an INDIE award for \\"Best Contemporary World Music Recording\\" from the Association for Independent Music (AFIM). In addition to producing his own albums, Hakmoun has contributed to other artist‚Äôs recordings, adding to such projects as \\"Caravan\\" for Dee Dee Bridgewater‚Äôs album Prelude To A Kiss, Ozomatli‚Äôs Street Sings, which won the award for \\"Best Alternative Music Album\\" at the Latin Grammy Awards in 2005 and \\"Lovelight\\" for Paula Cole‚Äôs Courage in 2007. Hakmoun has also composed and recorded for several films such as Rendezvous in Samarkand directed by Tim Bridwell, The Past and the Present of Djemma El Fna by Steve Montgomery and the documentary Footsteps in Africa. Hakmoun appeared in several movies as an actor, dancer and musician, including Disney‚Äôs Jungle 2 Jungle in 1997 and Rollerball by John McTiernan in 2002. Today Hakmoun continues to record and perform in major festivals and venues around the globe, as well as give master workshops in universities.

View from Bosworth Road Shenton Hall dovecote, Leicestershire Shenton is a hamlet in west Leicestershire, lying about two miles south-west of Market Bosworth. The hamlet is included in the civil parish of Sutton Cheney and is part of Hinckley and Bosworth District. Shenton was formerly a chapelry and township of the parish of Market Bosworth.William White, History, Gazetteer and Directory of Leicestershire, (Sheffield, 1846) p.576 The settlement is almost entirely agricultural, containing several farms. Much of the land has been in the same family since William Wollaston purchased the manor in 1625. It is essentially a privately owned estate village and has seen comparatively little modern development. It has been designated a conservation area.Bosworth Battlefield: The Way Forward, (Alison Farmer Associates, Cambridge 2013) p.37 The settlement lies either side of the Sence Brook, which is crossed by a picturesque Victorian bridge. The area is fairly flat, and subject to flooding. The hall has a fine gatehouse dated 1629, and a large, listed dovecote of 1719 within the hall grounds, close to the stable block. The main building was enlarged in the C19th. The hall itself was sold by the Wollaston family following government requisition during the Second World War, but most of the estate land in the settlement and the surrounding farmland, was not sold. The church of St John the Evangelist is part of Market Bosworth Benefice.http://www.marketbosworthbenefice.co.uk/ourchurches.html It was rebuilt by the Wollaston family in about 1860.Nikolaus Pevsner, Leicestershire and Rutland (Buildings of England), (Penguin Books, 1985) There is a C17th memorial to William Wollaston which was moved into the church. Admiral Sir Alexander Dundas Young Arbuthnott is buried in the churchyard. Shenton is close to the site of the Battle of Bosworth, which took place south-west of Market Bosworth. It is one of the four settlements named by the early C17th historian and local man, William Burton (of Lindley), to define the area of the battlefield.Peter Foss, The Field of Redemore: The Battle of Bosworth, 1485 (Kairos Press, 1998) Some of the estate was subject to intensive archaeological surveying in recent years as part of the project to locate the battlefield. The first, highly significant, find of round shot was made just west of Mill Lane, which leads from Shenton to Fenn Lanes Roman road.Glenn Foard & Anne Curry, Bosworth 1485, A Battlefield Rediscovered, (Oxford, Oxbow Books, 2013), p.109 The Ashby Canal passes to the east of the village and the road to Sutton Cheney and Market Bosworth passes beneath it through a narrow aqueduct tunnel. Shenton station lies some way from the village on the Sutton Cheney side, east of the canal. It is the southern terminus of the preserved Battlefield Line Railway, which runs to Shenton from Shackerstone. This is a section of what was originally the Ashby to Nuneaton railway line, opened in 1873. The station is located at the foot of Ambion Hill and is actually the reconstructed Humberstone Road Station from Leicester. The original Shenton station was demolished in the 1940s, except for a small lamp room that now serves as the Station Pottery.

The character was portrayed by Ron Holzschuh from 19 March 2003 to 13 February 2007.Deutsche Dailys.de It was expected that Holzschuh would just take a break from the role and return later in 2007, after a six months commitment to a stage play ended. However that never happened. Character's background Bernd is the younger brother of Martin von Beyenbach (Gerry Hungbauer), but the relationship between the two brothers hasn't been easy for a very long time. Few years back, Bernd had an affair with Martin's first wife Sylvia (Heike Brentano), when the family still owned a shipping company in Hamburg. He also managed an insurance fraud, which led to the ruin of the company and brought Sylvia, his partner-in-crime, behind bars for four years. Bernd himself never played for the fraud, when he fled to Brazil for the last couple of years. In Brazil also his daughter Vanessa (Inez Bj√∏rg David). Nearly 20 years later, Bernd comes to D√ºsseldorf, where Martin lives with his three children and his second wife Beatrice. But between the married-couple rages the wars of the roses. Bernd uses the situation to get Beatrice's trust. She doesn't know that Bernd only wants to use her to get Martin's company Beyenbach AllMedia. After the divorce, Bernd wants to marry Beatrice and brings her to accept his proposal. After the wedding, Bernd thinks that he can get his hand on Beatrice's shares of the company. But she wants to sell them to have for time for her new husband. Bernd needs to act fast and plans to murder his wife on a masked-ball. The attempted murder is foiled by Sylvia, but Beatrice falls into a coma. After another attempted murders come to nothing, Bernd lets Beatrice come home and sends her in a medically induced coma. Martin and his son Felix (Stefan Kirch) manage it to get Beatrice out of Bernd's care. But when Beatrice finally wakes up, she suffers amnesia and doesn't remember anything. While Bernd thinks he is safe, Beatrice's memories slowly come back and she realizes that Bernd tried to kill her. She plans her revenge, but Sylvia and Martin come behind Beatrice's plan and want to detain her. Martin even warns Bernd and he realizes that he needs to get away, while Beatrice is on a yacht waiting for him. She is shocked when Martin arrives instead of Bernd. It gets worse, when Beatrice tells him that she started a bomb and she can't stop it. When Martin and Beatrice try to escaped, Beatrice falls. Martin tries to help, when they both get killed by the explosion. Meanwhile, Bernd is driving to the airport and gets nervous when the police is looking for him, when he arrives. But they don't come to arrest Bernd, they want to tell him about Beatrice and Martin's death. Bernd is relieved and with the heritage of Beatrice's shares of Beyenbach AllMedia, he thinks he gets what he wanted in the first place. But Beatrice changed her will before her death and Bernd is left with nothing. He tries to fake the will, but his daughter Vanessa tells him to leave it. Felix becomes the sole heir. Sylvia and Felix enjoy their new power over Bernd, fire him from his job by Beyenbach AllMedia and throw him out of the house. It doesn't take long, until Bernd meets the beautiful countess Carla von Lahnstein (Claudia Hiersche). He wants to marry her, but this marriage with Carla would be a fake for Carla's father Johannes (Thomas Gumpert), who doesn't know that his daughter is a lesbian. After the lie comes out, Johannes still wants Carla to marry to Bernd, but later Carla and Bernd get a divorce, when the marriage lost their use. After her marriage with Carla, Bernd has many financial problems. He finds a new victim to get to money in the wealthy bistro owner Charlie Schneider (Gabriele Metzger). Charlie's brother Lars (Herbert Ulrich) and Carla warn her about Bernd, but she doesn't listen to them. Bernd's game seems to be a success, but then he sleeps with an attractive, young woman. He doesn't know is that this was Charlie's niece Olivia (Kristina D√∂rfer). She blackmails Bernd, when she needs more money for her dissolute life. But Olivia discovers that Bernd has no money. Olivia then discloses her one-night stand with Bernd on his engagement party with Charlie. Thinking that Charlie wouldn't forgive him, Bernd leaves town.

He was a novelist, poet, dramatist of excellence, analyst and a thought provoking writer. Considering his towering personality and profound knowledge, he is regarded as the \\"Pitamaha\\" (great grandfather) in Assamese literary world. In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the Assamese literature and society, the British government gave him Raibahadur title, a rare honour conferred for the first time to an Assamese person. He was also the first literary pensioner of Assam. Early life Padmanath Gohain Baruah was born in 1871 at Nakari village in North Lakhimpur. He started schooling in a Bengali medium school at his birthplace. He went to Calcutta in the last part of the 19th century to pursue higher education. His voyage started off as he became an active member of Asomiya Bhasar Unnati Sadhini Sabha, established by a number of Assamese students for the uplifting of Assamese language and literature. However fate had other plans for him. Gohain Baruah could not complete his BA examination as he found Latin very difficult to master. In those days the Indian students were expected to study an ancient language for their BA course, and Padmanath,who had not learned Sanskrit in his Bangla medium school, had opted for Latin. Failing to complete his graduation, Padmanath started preparing for Bachelor of Law examination, but was barred from appearing in the exam for being underage. Thus, although he had failed to acquire a formal degree in Calcutta, his years there had a very formative influence upon him. It was there that he came into contact with the contemporary stalwarts of the Assamese literature like Gunabhiram Baruah, Hemchandra Goswami, his senior fellow student Lakshminath Bezbarua etc. Moreover, it was Calcutta that he was inspired with a sense of duty towards his nation. His return to his homeland witnessed his dedication for the noble cause of the uplift of his mother tongue and he went on to write a number of books in various styles and forms. Literary career Padmanath with his friend Panindranath Gogoi wrote a number of textbooks in Assamese language. But untimely death of Panindranath led Padmanath to complete the mission alone. To meet the necessities of the Assamese students and teachers he wrote a number of textbooks on history, geography, moral science, teachers hand book and a book on physical exercise including life and works of many stalwarts of Assamese Society. He also edited 'Jivani Sangrah', a rare book in Assamese literature. He has immense contributions to the domain of Assamese language and literature. He is also revered as a founder of modern Assamese novel. His novel 'Bhanumoti', published in 1890 is the first Assamese novel. From literary point of view it is regarded as the first Assamese novel. His other novel is 'Lahori' (1892). As a playwright Padmanath was comparable to none in Assamese drama and theatre. He wrote a number of dramas on local plots and events. Picking up a number of glorious chapters from Assam history he wrote historical dramas like Joymoti, Gadadhar, Lachit Borphukan and Sadhani. On the basis of the legendary love story of Usha and Aniruddha he wrote a mythological drama called Ban Raja. In his social drama 'Gaonburha' he neatly described the economic condition of Assamese people under the British rule. His comedy Teton Tamuli and Bhoot Ne Bhram created spontaneous overflow of laughter among the readers and audiences. He is also credited to have written a monumental work: Sri Krishna. He has presented Lord Krishna as a multi faceted personality. Gohain Baruah was also a poet. His poetical works include ‚ÄòJurani‚Äô (contains 22 sonnets), 'Leela' and 'Fulor Chaneki'. The skilful poetical descriptions of landscapes in 'Leela' are very much beautiful, touchy and sober. The first session of Asam Sahitya Sabha was held on 26 December 1917 in Sivasagar under his presidency. Journalistic career A flag carrier of journalism progress in Assam, Gohain Baruah was closely allied with a number of Assamese journals and magazines. While studying in Kolkata, he with Krishnaprasad Duwara brought out an Assamese monthly called Bijulee. Later he became its editor and ran it for more than three years. In 1901, he with Mathura Mohan Baruah published a weekly called Asom Banti from Tezpur. At a most critical period Asom Banti played a leading role in Assamese language and literature. Acting as a mouthpiece of Assamese society it brought to the focus many important issues to the British government. In 1906 Gohain Baruah published a monthly called Usha. Many stalwarts like Hemchandra Goswami, Satyanath Bora, Sarat Chandra Goswami etc. regularly wrote in the magazine that heralded a new era in Assamese literature.

For most of the way, it is at least six lanes wide, and it is used by motorists for crosstown travel. It is designated E. Northern Pkwy and W. Northern Pkwy with Charles Street being the dividing line. It was constructed in the 1950s through several neighborhoods and several homes were razed in the process from right-of-way. The section of E. Northern Pkwy from Harford Road to Fleetwood Ave was originally called German Lane. Northern Parkway starts in the west at Liberty Heights Avenue in Northwest Baltimore's Lochearn community, and in the east at Belair Road in Overlea, Maryland. The road forms the northern boundary of Pimlico Racetrack. As the road moves eastward across Charles Street, Northern Parkway narrows becomes a residential street and part of Baltimore's Homeland neighborhood. From York Road east to Harford Road, northern Parkway is primarily lined with row houses and single family homes. Before intersecting with Bel Air Road, Northern Parkway splits into two one-way streets at Belford Ave in North East Baltimore City at the border between the Woodring and Raspeburg neighborhoods. The eastbound section becomes Fleetwood Ave at the intersection of Walther Ave. The westbound portion remains E. Northern Parkway; however its former name was Maple Ave. History Parts of E. Northern Parkway used to be Belvedere Avenue (parts of West Belvedere Avenue and East Belvedere Avenue still remain). Between 1950 and 1976, parts of Northern Parkway were expanded to six lanes with a median from Bellona Avenue east. Northern Parkway was built in various stages extending west from Old Harford Road to Hillen Road from the early 1950s to 1965. In 1973-75, work on the new section near York Road resulted in the demolition of businesses along York Road north of Belvedere Avenue, with at least one east west alley also being vacated by the city of Baltimore. The part of Northern Parkway near York Road was opened to traffic in December 1976; the section between The Alameda and Chinquapin Parkway was completed in June 1975. The original plan included for W. Northern Parkway to pass through Powder Mill park and connect to Security Blvd near the unfinished I-70 interchange in Gwynns Falls Park. In 2011 the Television show Extreme Home Makeover built a home on a vacant corner lot in the 3800 block of Fleetwood Ave. Several production trucks were housed on E. Northern Pkwy.

Route 36 operates from York Road to The Alameda, and Route 55 from McLean Boulevard to Belair Road, and Route 58 operates the longest distance of all, serving all points east of Falls Road. All other areas of Northern Parkway are within a close walk of a bus line. In addition, there are many lines that either cross or operate on small portions of Northern Parkway. These include Routes 1, 3, 8, 11, 15, 19, 27, 52, 53, 54, 61, and 91. The Rogers Avenue Metro Subway Station is located near Northern Parkway, and the Mt.

The archbishop of Pisa presides over the Ecclesiastical Province of Pisa, which includes the dioceses of Livorno, Massa Carrara-Pontremoli, Pescia, and Volterra. Since 2008 the Archbishop of Pisa has been Giovanni Paolo Benotto. History In a letter of 1 September 1077, Pope Gregory VII wrote to the bishops, clergy, civil leaders, and people of Corsica, acknowledging his responsibility for oversight of their well-being as part of the lands of S. Peter, but admitting that he was unable to do so personally and effectively. He had therefore appointed Bishop-elect Landulfus of Pisa to be his legate in Corsica.J.P. Migne, Patrologiae Latinae Tomus CXLVIII (Paris 1848), p. 487, no. 2. Kehr, p. 319, nos. 2-3. On 30 November 1078, Pope Gregory confirmed all the privileges that belonged to the Church of Pisa, as well as the legateship of Corsica. He granted the bishop half of all the papal income from the island, as well as all of the judicial income (de placitis).Kehr III, pp. 319-320, nos. 2-5. On 28 June 1091, Pope Urban II, at the request of Countess Matilda of Tuscany,The countess died on 24 July 1115, and her patronage of the Church of Pisa lapsed.

Kehr III, p. 320, no. 7. On 21 April 1092, Pope Urban issued the bull \\"Cum Universis\\", in which he created the metropolitanate of Pisa, promoting the bishop to the rank of archbishop, and assigning the bishoprics of Corsica as his suffragans. This he did at the request of Countess Matilda of Tuscany and in consideration of the considerable merits of Bishop Dagibert in remaining faithful to the Roman church in the face of the schism against Pope Gregory VII.\\"Corsicanae insulae Episcopatus regendos, ac disponendos Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae, cui auctore Deo, carissime Frater Daiberte, praesides praesentis decreti auctoritate committimus, atque subjicimus, teque Frater venerabilis in Archiepiscopum eiusdem insulae promovemus.\\" Poli, p. 181.

After the death of Pope Gelasius at Cluny on 29 January 1119, Archbishop Petrus and Cardinal Petrus della Gherardesca dei Conti di Donoratico, a native of Pisa and papal legate, crossed to Corsica to receive to obtain the oaths of fealty of the bishops of Corsica.Kehr III, pp. 321-322, no. 12; X, pp. 472-473. Pope Gelasius' bull was an unpleasant shock for Genoa, who coveted the island of Corsica, and a war broke out in 1119 between the two naval powers. The Genoese sent out a fleet of 28 galleys, but in a battle at Porto Venere the Pisans were victorious, as they were at a second battle at the mouth of the Arno River. The war lasted a total of fourteen years.Heywood, A History of Pisa, pp. 71-74. On 16 May 1120, the new pope, Calixtus II, who had been elected at Cluny in France and had just returned to Italy, issued a bull confirming the privileges of Urban II and Gelasius II.Kehr III, p. 322, no. 13. But on 3 January 1121, Pope Calixtus wrote to the bishops of Corsica that the privilege of consecrating bishops for Corsica, which had been granted to the Archbishops of Pisa, was withdrawn, and that in the future only the Pope would have the right to consecrate bishops for Corsica and to receive their oaths of submission.Cappelletti XIII, pl. 310-311; XVI, p. 90. Kehr III, p. 322, no. 15. The Genoese were not mollified by the Pope's action. They resorted to bribery to obtain what they had not obtained by military force. A document, written in Rome and dated 16 June 1121, reveals that negotiations had been taking place, with the agreement and authorization of Pope Calixtus, between the Genoese agents, Caffaro and Barisone, and a committee of three cardinals and a bishop on the question of Corsica. The Genoese had agreed to give money to the Pope and other members of the Curia by 10 November. The Pope was to receive 1,600 silver marks; cardinals and bishops 300 marks; priests and clerics 50 ounces of gold; Cardinal Peter of Porto 303 ounces of gold; Petrus Leonis 100 silver marks, and his sons 55 marks; Leo Frangipane 40 marks; and additional payments to other nobles. Heywood, A History of Pisa, pp. 74-75. The opportune moment to satisfy the Genoans came when Calixtus II convened the First Lateran Council on 27 March 1123, to ratify the Concordat of Worms and end the schism instigated by the Emperor Henry V. The Pope appointed a committee, consisting of 24 bishops and other prelates, led by Archbishop Gualterius of Ravenna (a personal enemy of the Archbishop of Pisa), to examine and render a judgment on the claims of the Church of Pisa over Corsica. On 6 April, the last day of the Council, the claims of Pisa were rejected by the Fathers, after the damning report of Archbishop Gualterius.J. D. Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XXI (Venice: A. Zatta 1776), p. 279. Heywood, pp. 75-76. The loss was temporary, however, for, on 21 July 1126, the new pope, Honorius II, restored the privilege, and granted the archbishops the right of holding synods not only in Pisa, but also in Corsica.Kehr III, p. 323-324, no. 22. He took the trouble to rebuke Calixtus II and his committee, stating that the Pisans had been despoiled sine praecedente ipsorum Pisanorum culpa et absque iudicio ('without any preceding crime on the part of the Pisans and without a judicial hearing'). Heywood, A History of Pisa, p. 78. In 1127, Archbishop Ruggero, who had leagued himself with Arezzo and Florence, made war against Siena. He was taken prisoner, and spent more than a year in captivity.Heywood, A History of Pisa, p. 77. On March 1133, Pope Innocent elevated Genoa to the status of an archbishopric, and assigned it metropolitan status over Mariana, Nebbio, and Accia (on Corsica); Bobbio, and Brugnato (newly created), to which was added the diocese of Albenga, formerly in the Metropolitanate of Milan.Cappelletti XVI, pp. 22-23. The Pope also enfeoffed Genoa with the northern half of the island. The archdiocese of Pisa therefore lost ecclesiastical control of the northern half of the island of Corsica, retaining the dioceses of Ajaccio, Aleria, and Salona. Pisa was compensated, to a small degree, by being named Metropolitan of Populonia (Massa Maritima).Kehr III, p. 324, no. 23; VI, part 2, p. 266. Heywood, pp. 79-80. These grants, which had been made to Archbishop Hubertus, were confirmed in the bull \\"Tunc Apostolicae\\" on 22 April 1138, and in addition Innocent II granted Pisa the honorary primacy of the province of Turritana. He also confirmed the legateship over Sardinia which had been granted by Urban II, and the right to consecrate the six bishops in his ecclesiastical province.Kehr III, p. 325, no. 26. From the late 12th to the early 13th century, the Pisan archdiocese was the feudal suzerain of the four giudicati of Sardinia. On 6 March 1131, Gonnario of Torres swore fealty to Archbishop Ruggero of Pisa.The four giudicati were: Arborea, Cagliari, Gallura, and Torres. Mauro G. Sanna (2013), Onorio III e la Sardegna, ed. critica e commento delle fonti storiche a cura di M.G. Sanna, Cagliari: Centro di studi filologici sardi, pp. xx-xxiv; 198-199. On 22 April 1459, Pope Pius II issued the bull \\"Triumphans Pastor\\", in which he raised the diocese of Siena to metropolitan status, and assigned to it as suffragans the dioceses of Soano, Chiusi, Massa Marittima (Populonia), and Grosseto. Massa was taken from the metropolitanate of Pisa. Kehr III, p. 317. Council of Pisa of Innocent II From 30 May 1135 to 6 June 1135, Innocent II held a council in Pisa, having been driven from Rome a second time by the supporters of Pope Anacletus II. In Pisa, with the encouragement of Bernard of Clairvaux, who was travelling with him and supporting his cause, he summoned a council of bishops. The number of attendees is not known, but it is said that bishops from Spain, Gascony, England, France, Burgundy, Germany, Hungary, Lombardy, and Tuscany attended. Innocent II excommunicated his rival, Anacletus II, and all his followers. In the council, it was ordered that all clergy who had married should separate from their wives. It ordered all simoniacs to leave their offices. It ordered that no one should be an archdeacon or a dean who was not ordained a deacon or priest. Such honors should not be granted to adolescents. It granted the right of asylum to churches and cemeteries.J. D. Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XXI (Venice: A. Zatta 1776), pp. 485-492. Philippus Jaff√© (ed. S. Lowenfeld), , pp. 865-866. Schism At the instigation of the German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, a double election took place in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome on 7 September 1159, a considerable majority of cardinals supporting Pope Alexander III (Orlando Bandinelli), and a small minority supporting Ottaviano of Monticelli, who took the name Victor IV. The archbishop of Pisa, Villano Villani, supported Pope Alexander. In 1164, after the death of Victor, Barbarossa promoted Cardinal Guido of Crema as Paschal III. In 1167 Barbarossa began a fourth war in Italy, and he and his pope Paschal ordered the leaders of Pisa to elect an archbishop to replace the loyal Villano,Ughelli III, pp. 401-404. who had already been sent into exile in 1163 and 1164, and was again in flight from imperial agents. On 8 April 1167, the leaders of Pisa, who were loyal to the Emperor, chose a Canon of the cathedral, Benencasa, and he and the Pisans travelled to Viterbo, where the antipope ordained him a priest on Holy Saturday and consecrated him a bishop on Easter Monday. They returned to Pisa on 23 May 1167.Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptores, Vol. XIX: Annales Aevi Suevici, p. 256 (Annales Pisani). Heywood, pp. 165, 169, 188. Kehr III, p. 327, no. 39. General Council of Pisa In the spring of 1408, Pisa became directly involved in the struggles of the Western Schism, which had been tormenting Christendom for thirty years. Gregory XII, who had been driven from Rome on 9 August 1407, was staying in Lucca, where, in May 1408, he created several new cardinals. He did this in violation of two solemn oaths he had taken, and without consulting the cardinals. When they objected and refused to attend the installation ceremonies, Gregory ordered them arrested. One by one the cardinals fled from Lucca, and sought refuge in Pisa.Carl Joseph Hefele, Histoire des Conciles (ed. H. Leclercq) Tome VI, deuxi√®me partie (Paris: Letouzey 1915), pp. 1339-1343. On 29 June 1408, thirteen cardinals (who held the proxies of two more cardinals) met at Livorno, in the diocese of Pisa, and issued a statement calling for a general council of the Church to address and end the schism. Their document was later subscribed by four additional cardinals. The Council of Pisa held its first session in the cathedral in Pisa on 25 March 1409.Carl Joseph Hefele, Histoire des Conciles (ed. H. Leclercq) Tome VII, premi√®re partie (Paris: Letouzey 1916), pp. 1-11. Archbishop Alamanno Adimari (1406‚Äì1411) was present.Lenfant I, p. 352. Both Gregory and Benedict XIII were deposed and excommunicated on 5 June 1409, having failed to answer repeated summonses from the Council to answer the charges against them.Hefele VII.1, pp. 43-48. =Papal conclave= With both popes deposed, a new pope was needed. The Council discussed the possibility of intervention or participation in the selection, but it was decided to leave the cardinals to their canonical duty, so that no cause of complaint could be lodged. The cardinals in Pisa decided to wait the canonical ten days after the decease of a pope to begin their conclave, even though no pope had died. Twenty-three cardinals entered conclave, which was held in the archbishop's palace in the cathedral close, on 15 June 1411; they were joined by a twenty-fourth on 16 June. On 26 June, they elected unanimously the Cardinal of Milan, Pietro Filargi, OFM, who took the name Alexander V. He was crowned on 7 July 1411, on a platform erected in the square before the cathedral of Pisa. J. P. Adams, California State University Northridge, Sede vacante 1409; retrieved: 16 March 2020. Conciliabulum of Pisa In 1511, at the instigation of King Louis XII of France, a meeting was held in Pisa, summoned by four cardinals led by Bernardino Carvajal, which called itself a general council. Others called it the conciliabulum Pisanum.J. D. Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XXXV (Paris: Hubert Welter 1902), pp. 155-172. Only two archbishops, fourteen bishops, and a number of French abbots attended. The \\"little council\\" held its first session on 5 November 1511. It attempted to take measures to depose Pope Julius II. The people of Pisa attempted to close the doors of the cathedral against the meeting, and their hostility, after three sessions, drove the bishops to adjourn their sessions to Milan, where they met on 13 December.Ferdinand Gregorovius, History of Rome in the Middle Ages Vol. V, part 1 (London: Bell 1902), pp. 87-90.

Kehr III, p. 335, no. 21. was dedicated originally to the Virgin as S. Maria (Maggiore), and then more specifically to the taking of the body of the Virgin Mary up into heaven (Assumption). The cathedral was staffed and administered by a corporate body called the Chapter (Capitulum), which was originally composed of five dignities and (at one point) twenty-eight Canons. The dignities were: the Archpriest, the Archdeacon, the Dean, the Primicerius, and the Vicedominus.Ughelli III, p. 347. Cappelletti XVI, p. 221. In 1702, there were only three dignities and twenty-five Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 315, note 1.

A special assembly (conventus) was held in Pisa from 5‚Äì12 May 1850, summoned by Archbishop Giovanni Battista Parretti (1839-1851), and including his suffragan bishops (Pontremoli, Massa Maritima, Livorno), and, at his invitation, the Archbishop of Lucca, the Bishop of Pescia, and the Vicar Capitular of Volterra (which were immediately subject to the pope). Delegates of the various cathedral Chapters were also invited. The meeting was occasioned by the revolution in Rome, which had deposed Pope Pius IX from his position as head of the Papal States and seen him flee from the city in disguise to a refuge in Neapolitan territory. The meeting was, in fact, sanctioned by Pope Pius.Mansi-Petit-Martin, Tomus XLIII, pp. 845-882. New dioceses and suffragans In a bull of 17 March 1726, Pescia was established as a diocese by Pope Benedict XIII, and was for a long time immediately subject to the Holy See (Papacy).Cappelletti XVIII, p. 358.

Spicciani (ed.), Pescia. La storia, l'arte e il costume, Pisa 2001, p. 87. On 1 August 1856, Pope Pius IX, in the bull \\"Ubi Primum\\", made Pescia a suffragan of (subordinate to) the archbishop of Pisa. The diocese of Livorno was created by Pope Pius VII in the bull \\"Militantis Ecclesiae\\" of 25 September 1806, at the urging of Queen Maria Luisa, Regent of Tuscany.Cappelletti XVI, pp. 259-267. The erection was opposed both by the Archdiocese of Pisa and the Canons of San Miniato, who would lose territory, power, and income from the change.Cappelletti, p. 267.

The side played amateur football until 1936 when the club turned professional and was elected into the Southern League. Ipswich Town were elected into Division Three of the Football League in place of Gillingham F.C. on 30 May 1938. The club experienced league success during the early 1960s, winning the Football League Championship in 1961‚Äì62, one season after winning promotion from the Second Division. Two decades later, under the guidance of Bobby Robson, the club achieved success both in the FA Cup and in European competition, winning the UEFA Cup in 1981. Ipswich Town have made a contribution to the history of the England national football team; both Robson and Sir Alf Ramsey moved on from Ipswich to manage England, presiding over the nation's best results in the World Cup: fourth place in 1990 and world champions in 1966.  Foundation to professionalism: 1878‚Äì1936  Portman Road, Ipswich's home ground since 1884 The club was founded on 16 October 1878 as an amateur side known as Ipswich A.F.C., under the presidency of local MP Thomas Cobbold who had played football at Charterhouse School. George S Sherrington & J. M. Franks were elected joint Captains.John Eastwood and Tony Moyse, \\"The Men who made the Town\\", 1986. Ipswich A.F.C.'s first match was a 6‚Äì1 home victory over Stoke Wanderers at the Broom Hill ground on 2 November 1878. This was followed by a 2‚Äì0 victory over Harwich in the club's first away match. Losing only one game in 17 in its second season, the club was able to build enough interest to enrol players for a second team. Ipswich recorded their biggest ever victory during the 1880‚Äì81 season, a 15‚Äì0 defeat of East Stamford with one player, John Knights, registering a treble hat trick; both achievements remain club records. The team moved to Portman Road, the current ground, in 1884, and would share, until 1936, the facilities with the East Suffolk Cricket Club who had played there since 1855. The Cobbold family involvement continued when, in 1885, Nathanael Fromanteel Cobbold was elected as a vice-president of the club. Following his sudden death the following year, the position was then held by his nephew John Dupuis Cobbold. The club won their first trophy in the 1886‚Äì87 season, triumphing 2‚Äì1 against a team representing Ipswich School in the final of the Suffolk Challenge Cup. In 1888 the club merged with Ipswich Rugby Club to form Ipswich Town F.C. In 1890, the club entered the qualifying rounds of the FA Cup for the first time and was knocked out in the final qualifying round by the 93rd Highlanders. The club experienced scant success in the Cup during the 1890s but won a number of local cup competitions, including the Suffolk Senior Cup and the Ipswich Charity Cup. Having received invitations to join from both the Southern League and the Norfolk & Suffolk League, Ipswich joined the latter in the 1899‚Äì1900 season, finishing fourth in their first league season. They were league runners-up in 1902‚Äì03.Norfolk & Suffolk League 1897‚Äì1939 Non-League Matters In 1903 they also entered a team into the new South East Anglian League and were its inaugural champions.[ 1903‚Äì04[ Pride of Anglia They left the South East Anglian League in 1906, but continued playing in the Norfolk & Suffolk League. In 1907, Ipswich became founder members of the Southern Amateur League. The club narrowly avoided relegation in many of the following seasons, and suffered a club record 15‚Äì1 defeat at the hands of the Corinthians at Portman Road on New Year's Day, 1910. The outbreak of the First World War and the commandeering of Portman Road by the Army curtailed the 1914‚Äì15 season and organised football did not return until the 1920‚Äì21 season. Just one year later, Ipswich Town became champions of the Southern Amateur League, clinching the title on the last day of the season. The club won the league a further three times, in 1929‚Äì30, 1932‚Äì33 and 1933‚Äì34, before becoming founder members of the Eastern Counties Football League at the end of the 1934‚Äì35 season.  Early Football League: 1936‚Äì1955  League positions since 1938‚Äì39 season In 1936, local businessman Leonard P. Thompson threatened to lead a breakaway from the amateur club to create an entirely separate professional club, Ipswich United. John Murray Cobbold, the club President, called together rival factions for a meeting at the Town Hall on 1 May 1936, at which it was agreed that Ipswich Town should turn professional. The club was unanimously elected to the Southern League for the 1936‚Äì37 season and former Irish international footballer Mick O'Brien was appointed as the club's first professional manager. The club's first professional game at Portman Road resulted in a 4‚Äì1 win against Tunbridge Wells Rangers and the club went on to win the Southern League in their debut season. O'Brien left after just one season following the death of his wife. Ipswich Town were managerless until 10 November 1936 when the club appointed Scott Duncan, who had left recently relegated Manchester United. He led Ipswich to third place in the 1937‚Äì38 season. Ipswich Town F.C. were elected to The Football League on 30 May 1938 by a margin of just two votes, at the expense of Gillingham F.C., initially playing in Division Three (South). The club's last competitive match before the league was suspended due to the Second World War was a 1‚Äì1 draw with local rivals, Norwich City. Both John Murray Cobbold and director Robert Nevill Cobbold were killed during the war, the position of director being filled by John Cavendish Cobbold in 1948. Despite the interruption due to the war, Duncan managed the club for over 500 games between 1937 and 1955. Following three successive top-eight finishes, the 1949‚Äì50 season ended with Ipswich in 17th position in Division Three (South), the club's lowest ever league finish. Merthyr in 1951 During the early 1950s striker Tom Garneys finished as club top-scorer for four seasons in a row, and became the first professional Ipswich player to score four times in a game. During this period, Ipswich won the title and promotion to the Second Division in the 1953‚Äì54 season, during which eight consecutive wins were recorded. The club was relegated back to Division Three (South) the following year at the end of a poor season, the highlight of which was progress to the fifth round of the FA Cup, a run ended by First Division Preston North End. Ipswich won eight matches in a row from 23 September 1953 to 31 October 1953. Duncan resigned but stayed on at the club in a secretarial role for a further three years. His replacement was a managerial novice, former England international and double Championship winner at Tottenham Hotspur, Alf Ramsey.  Ramsey and champions of England: 1955‚Äì69  Ted Phillips (left) and former team-mate Ray Crawford at Portman Road Alf Ramsey's appointment led Billy Wright to comment, \\"In appointing Alf to become their manager Ipswich Town paid a tremendous tribute to intelligent football ‚Äì and footballers who think!\\" In Ramsey's first season at the club, Ipswich scored 106 goals in 46 games and finished third in Division Three (South). The following season, 1956‚Äì57, the club won the Division Three (South) title for the second time and saw the emergence of local striker Ted Phillips who scored 46 times during the season; this remains the highest number of goals scored by an Ipswich player in a season. During the same season, Ipswich played under floodlights for the first time, at Coventry City in September 1956. At the end of that season that John Cavendish Cobbold was appointed as the club's chairman. Three seasons of mid-table finishes followed as Ipswich established themselves in Division Two, along with moderate success in the FA Cup, most notably reaching the fifth round in the 1958‚Äì59 season. Ipswich had their most successful season to that point in 1960‚Äì61, winning the Second Division and promotion to the top level of English football, ahead of Sheffield United and Liverpool. In the top flight, Ipswich became champions of the Football League at the first attempt in 1961‚Äì62, with Ray Crawford joint English and European top scorer with Derek Kevan of West Bromwich Albion. Matt Busby described the title-winners as \\"... one of the First Division's most attractive sides ...\\". As English league champions, Ipswich qualified for European football for the first time. They met Maltese side Floriana in the European Cup, defeating them 14‚Äì1 on aggregate in the first round before losing to A.C. Milan in the second round; it would be another 11 years before the club would qualify for Europe again. Ramsey quit the club in April 1963 to take charge of the England national football team, and Ipswich finished only four places above relegation in the 1962‚Äì63 season. To commemorate Ramsey's success at the club, a statue of him was unveiled outside Portman Road in 2000 by Ray Crawford. Ramsey was replaced by Jackie Milburn, under whose leadership fortunes on the pitch declined. Two years after winning the league title, Ipswich dropped into the Second Division in 1963‚Äì64, conceding 121 league goals in 42 games, still the highest number of goals conceded by Ipswich in a season. Patrick Mark Cobbold, John's brother, joined the board of directors in 1964 and their mother, Lady Blanche Cobbold, became honorary president of the club. Milburn quit after just one full season and was replaced by Bill McGarry early in the 1964‚Äì65 season. The club remained in the Second Division for four years until McGarry guided Ipswich to promotion in the 1967‚Äì68 season, winning the division by a single point ahead of Queens Park Rangers. McGarry left to manage Wolves and was replaced by Bobby Robson in January 1969.  Robson and Europe: 1969‚Äì82  Bobby Robson guided Ipswich to success in the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup. Bobby Robson's appointment followed a chance encounter with Ipswich director Murray Sangster while scouting at Portman Road for Chelsea manager Dave Sexton. Robson had some experience of management from his time at Fulham, although he had been sacked after failing to avoid relegation from Division Two. Robson's sides finished 18th and 19th in his first two seasons at Ipswich, but he kept the team in the top division, before finding greater success. Robson led the club to fourth place in the First Division and success in the Texaco Cup, beating local rivals Norwich City 4‚Äì2, in the 1972‚Äì73 season. The fourth-place finish meant Ipswich qualified for the 1973‚Äì74 UEFA Cup. In the first round, they were drawn against six-time European champions Real Madrid. Following a 1‚Äì0 victory at Portman Road, Ipswich needed to defend their slim lead. Ipswich captain Mick Mills was reported in the Spanish press suggesting that \\"El Real no es invincible\\" (\\"Real are not invincible\\") and a 0‚Äì0 draw at the Bernab√©u secured Ipswich's shock passage into the second round. The club fell at the quarter final stage but fourth place in the league enabled Ipswich to return to the tournament in the following season. In the 1974‚Äì75 season, Ipswich finished third in the First Division and were losing semi-finalists in the FA Cup. Suffering from cancer and becoming less able to carry out his duties as chairman, John Cobbold swapped roles with director Patrick Cobbold in 1976. In the 1975‚Äì76 season Ipswich finished sixth of the league, and in October 1976, they signed Paul Mariner from Plymouth for a club record ¬£220,000. The team challenged Liverpool for the First Division title for much of the 1976‚Äì77 season, going top of the table in February 1977 with a 5‚Äì0 defeat of Norwich City in the East Anglian derby. Mariner's efforts helped the club to a third- place finish, and the following season, he scored seven goals in the FA Cup as the club won the second major honour in its history, Roger Osborne scoring the winning goal in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium. The club's league fortunes dipped dramatically during the season finishing 18th, just three points above the relegation places, but the team reached the third round of the UEFA Cup, where they beat Barcelona 3‚Äì0 at Portman Road; Barcelona won the second leg 3‚Äì0, Johan Cruyff scoring twice, and Ipswich went out on penalties. The team's FA Cup success secured qualification for the 1978‚Äì79 European Cup Winners' Cup, where they reached the quarter-finals, again losing to Barcelona. Over the next two seasons Robson brought Dutchmen Arnold M√ºhren and Frans Thijssen to the club while the team achieved two further top six finishes in the First Division. However, it was the 1980‚Äì81 season which, in Robson's words, \\"... helped put Ipswich on the map ...\\". Paul Mariner, top scorer at Ipswich from 1977‚Äì78 to 1979‚Äì80 The club finished second in the league once more and were losing semi-finalists in the FA Cup, but the real success of the season was victory in the UEFA Cup. Beating Michel Platini's AS Saint-√âtienne 4‚Äì1 at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in the quarter-finals and a 2‚Äì0 aggregate victory over 1. FC K√∂ln in the semi- final led Ipswich to the club's first European final, played over two legs against AZ 67 Alkmaar. A 3‚Äì0 victory at Portman Road was followed by a 4‚Äì2 defeat at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, resulting in a 5‚Äì4 aggregate victory over the Dutch side. Ipswich therefore began the 1981‚Äì82 UEFA Cup campaign as holders, but lost in the first round to Scottish opponents Aberdeen. Domestically, the club had continued success, finishing second in the First Division yet again, this time four points behind Liverpool.This was the season in which three points for league victories was introduced. Robson's achievements with Ipswich earned him an offer from the Football Association to become the England national coach; he declined an offer of a ten-year contract extension from Ipswich director Patrick Cobbold. On 7 July 1982, two days after England were knocked out of the 1982 World Cup, Bobby Robson left Ipswich to succeed Ron Greenwood as coach of England. During his 13-year tenure at Ipswich, Robson brought in only 14 players from other clubs, relying instead on players developed through the club's youth programmes. In 2002, in recognition of Robson's achievements with the club, a life-size statue of him was unveiled opposite the Cobbold Stand at Portman Road. On 7 July 2006, Robson was named as honorary president of Ipswich Town Football Club, the first since Lady Blanche Cobbold who had died in 1987.  After Robson: 1982‚Äì1995  Bobby Robson was replaced at Ipswich by his chief coach, Bobby Ferguson. Ferguson made the transition from coach to manager in July 1982, but some success in the various cup competitions was offset by an end to the high league positions the club had enjoyed under Robson. In the three seasons from 1982‚Äì83 to 1984‚Äì85, Ipswich reached the FA Cup quarter-final and League Cup semi-final in 1985, but declined in the league, finishing 9th, 12th and 17th. In the following season, the team's league form was even poorer, resulting in a 20th-place finish and relegation to the Second Division.There were 22 clubs in the division at that time, as shown in the referenced link. Ipswich finished fifth in the Second Division in the 1986‚Äì87 season to qualify for the play-offs, but Ferguson resigned after losing to 2‚Äì1 on aggregate to Charlton Athletic. John Wark spent three periods of his career at Ipswich. From 1987 to 1990, Ipswich Town were managed by John Duncan, but achieved only mid-table finishes each season with the club gaining a reputation as a \\"competent Second Division side\\". Duncan was sacked in June 1990 and was replaced by John Lyall, whose 14-year reign as West Ham United manager had ended the previous summer. During that time the Hammers had won the FA Cup twice and finished third in the league. Lyall guided Ipswich to a mid-table finish in the 1990‚Äì91 season but a considerable improvement the following season led to winning the Second Division championship. The team was promoted to join the inaugural season of the FA Premier League. After a good start to the season, Ipswich were in fourth place in the league in January 1993, but a dip in form during the final weeks of the season saw the club finish 16th. The next season was almost a mirror of the previous; Ipswich again made a good start, followed by a late slump in results. The club only avoided relegation when Sheffield United suffered a last-gasp 3‚Äì2 defeat at Chelsea on the final day of the season. Lyall was sacked as Ipswich manager in December 1994 with the club at the bottom of the Premiership. His successor George Burley was unable to turn things around and Ipswich suffered a \\"humiliating\\" 9‚Äì0 defeat at Manchester United in early March, the biggest margin in a Premiership match. Relegation was confirmed soon afterwards and Ipswich ended the season having conceded 93 goals in 42 league games. Patrick Cobbold had left his role as club chairman in 1991, handing his position to John Kerr. His brother had died in 1983 and Patrick died suddenly in 1994, but the Cobbold connection continued when Patrick and John's nephew Major Philip William Hope-Cobbold joined the board in 1995.  Europe, administration and Championship regulars: 1995‚Äì2018  Ipswich won the First Division play-off final at Wembley Stadium in 2000. Having served on the board of directors since 1986, David Sheepshanks was appointed as club chairman in 1995. The next four seasons brought near-misses as the club flirted with promotion; in 1995‚Äì96, Ipswich fell one place short of the First Division play-off zone, and the ensuing three seasons brought successive semi-final play-off defeats. In 2000, Ipswich qualified for the Division One play-off final, the last such match at Wembley Stadium before the stadium was to be redeveloped. They beat Barnsley 4‚Äì2 securing their return to the Premiership after an absence of five years. Ipswich made only one major signing during the off-season, buying Hermann Hrei√∞arsson from Wimbledon F.C. for a club record ¬£4m two days before the season commenced. Television pundits Rodney Marsh and Mark Lawrenson both agreed relegation would be the obvious outcome. Ipswich surprised the doubters; they sustained a high league position and narrowly missed out on qualification for the UEFA Champions League, when the team failed to win on the last day of the season against Derby County. The fifth-place finish gained the club a UEFA Cup place and earned George Burley the title of FA Premier League Manager of the Year, an award that until 2010 had, in every other season, been given to the manager of the Premier League champions. Matteo Sereni and Finidi George arrived before the 2001‚Äì02 season to boost the squad for its foray into Europe. The club's league form was poor, and 18 games into the campaign, Ipswich were bottom of the table with just one league victory. However, there was some relief in the UEFA Cup with a victory over Inter Milan 1‚Äì0 at home in the third round, despite which the tie was lost over two legs after a 4‚Äì1 defeat at the San Siro. From bottom of the table at Christmas, a run of seven wins from eight fixtures appeared to have secured the team's league status, but another decline set in and relegation was confirmed on the final day of the season with a 5‚Äì0 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield. The loss of income due to relegation to the Championship contributed to the club going into financial administration, resulting in the sale of a number of players including Jamie Clapham, Darren Ambrose, and club captain Matt Holland. Ipswich had the consolation of again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, through UEFA's Fair Play system, losing in the second round to Czech side Slovan Liberec. A poor start to the domestic season, leaving the club 19th in the table by mid-October, resulted in George Burley being sacked after nearly eight years as manager. First team coach Tony Mowbray was in charge for four games as caretaker manager, winning once, but he was replaced as manager by the permanent appointment of former Oldham Athletic, Everton and Manchester City manager Joe Royle, whose managerial career had previously yielded four promotions and one FA Cup victory; as a player, he had been named player of the year in his only full season at Ipswich's local rivals Norwich City. Jim Magilton played for Ipswich for seven years before spending three years as manager. When Royle became Ipswich manager, the club was struggling near the Division One relegation zone, but the change in management sparked a revival and Ipswich narrowly failed to reach the 2002‚Äì03 play-offs. The club came out of administration during the 2003‚Äì04 season, and continued to challenge for promotion back to the Premier League. Ipswich finished that season in fifth place, but were beaten in the play-off semi finals by West Ham United 2‚Äì1 on aggregate. Ipswich missed automatic promotion in the 2004‚Äì05 season, finishing third, only two points behind second-placed Wigan Athletic. Again, they lost to West Ham United in the play off semi-finals, this time by a 4‚Äì2 aggregate score. Although they had been pre-season promotion favourites for the 2005‚Äì06 season, Ipswich finished 15th, the club's lowest finish since 1966, and Joe Royle resigned on 11 May 2006. At a press conference held on 5 June 2006, Jim Magilton was officially named as the new manager and former academy director Bryan Klug was appointed as first team coach. In Magilton's first season, the club reached a final placing of 14th place in the table. That year, Ipswich became the first carbon neutral football club in England following a collaboration between the fans and the club's main sponsor E.ON. In October 2007, Ipswich agreed to sell a ¬£44m stake in the club to British businessman Marcus Evans who became the majority owner and shareholder. 2007‚Äì08 brought further progress for Magilton and his side, who finished eighth in the final table. Magilton's team failed to gain promotion or reach the play-offs in the 2008‚Äì09 season, and on 22 April 2009 Magilton was sacked. His successor, Roy Keane, was appointed as manager the following day. Sheepshanks stood down as chairman after 14 years on 20 May 2009. Ipswich started the 2009‚Äì10 season winless in the league after 14 games and bottom of the Championship, their worst ever start to a league season. Limited success throughout the year saw the club finish 15th in Keane's first full season at the club. Keane's second season at the club started well but by the start of 2011, the club were 19th in the Championship, and he left the club on 7 January 2011. First team coach Ian McParland stood in as caretaker manager for two matches, including a semi- final first leg win in the League Cup against Arsenal, before Paul Jewell took the role on permanently in mid-January 2011. Ipswich finished 13th that season, and 15th the following, Jewell's first full season at the club. The longest-serving members of the Championship, Ipswich were bottom of the league by late October, and Jewell left the club by \\"mutual consent\\", leaving Chris Hutchings in a caretaker role. After a single match, Hutchings was replaced by Mick McCarthy on a full-time basis. McCarthy led Ipswich to finish in 14th position that season, and 9th in the following season. Despite losing their final match of the 2014‚Äì15 season, Ipswich finished in sixth place and secured a play-off place where they played their local rivals Norwich City, losing 4‚Äì2 on aggregate. The following season Ipswich finished just outside the playoff places, in seventh place. The 2016‚Äì17 season saw Ipswich finish 16th, their lowest finish since the 1958‚Äì59 season. On 29 March 2018, the club announced that Mick McCarthy's contract, which was due to expire at the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season, would not be extended. McCarthy announced that he was quitting during the post-match press conference following a 1‚Äì0 victory over Barnsley on 10 April 2018. He was replaced until the end of the season by Bryan Klug as a caretaker manager. \\"A new era\\": 2018‚Äìpresent Paul Hurst was appointed as manager for the start of the 2018‚Äì19 season, with the club heralding it as \\"a new era\\", but was sacked less than five months later after securing a single victory in fourteen league matches, leaving Ipswich bottom of the Championship. On 27 October 2018, former Norwich City manager Paul Lambert was appointed as the new manager. Winning 3 games in the next 28 resulted in Ipswich being relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time since 1957, with relegation being confirmed following a one-all draw with Birmingham City on 13 April 2019. Ipswich finished their first season in League One in eleventh, with the final standings ultimately being decided by points-per-game due to the season's suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The term civet applies to over a dozen different mammal species. Most of the species diversity is found in southeast Asia. The best-known civet species is the African civet, Civettictis civetta, which historically has been the main species from which a musky scent used in perfumery was obtained. The word civet may also refer to the distinctive musky scent produced by the animals. In 2002‚Äì03, civets sold for meat in local markets of China's Yunnan province carried the SARS virus from horseshoe bats to humans. The resulting viral outbreak killed 774 people in 2002‚Äì2003. Taxonomy The common name is used for a variety of carnivorous mammalian species, mostly of the family Viverridae. The African palm civet (Nandinia binotata) is genetically distinct and belongs in its own monotypic family, Nandiniidae. Civets are also called \\"toddycats\\" in English, \\"Luwak\\" in Indonesian, \\"musang\\" in Malaysian, and urul«£vƒÅ () in Sinhalese. There can be confusion among speakers of Malaysian because the indigenous word \\"musang\\" has been mistakenly applied to foxes by printed media instead of \\"rubah\\", which is the correct but lesser-known term. Foxes are not native to Southeast Asia, but they exist in popular culture (e.g., visual media imported from the West). A minority of writers use \\"civet\\" to refer only to Civettictis, Viverra and Viverricula civets.Gaubert, P., Cordeiro-Estrela, P. (2006). Phylogenetic systematics and tempo of evolution of the Viverrinae (Mammalia, Carnivora, Viverridae) within feliformians: Implications for faunal exchanges between Asia and Africa . Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 41: 266‚Äì278. But in more common usage in English, the name also covers Chrotogale, Cynogale, Diplogale, Hemigalus, Arctogalidia, Macrogalidia, Paguma and Paradoxurus civets. Physical characteristics Civets have a broadly cat-like general appearance, though the muzzle is extended and often pointed, rather like that of an otter, mongoose or even possibly a ferret. They range in length from about (excluding their long tails) and in weight from about . The civet produces a musk (named civet after the animal) which is highly valued as a fragrance and stabilizing agent for perfume. Both male and female civets produce the strong-smelling secretion, which is produced by the civet's perineal glands. It is harvested by either killing the animal and removing the glands, or by scraping the secretions from the glands of a live animal. The latter is the preferred method today. Animal rights groups, such as World Animal Protection, express concern that harvesting musk is cruel to animals. Between these ethical concerns and the availability of synthetic substitutes, the practice of raising civets for musk is dying out. Chanel, maker of the popular perfume Chanel No. 5, claims that natural civet has been replaced with a synthetic substitute since 1998.The Straight Dope: Does civet come from tortured cats? Does kopi luwak coffee come from pre-eaten beans? Habitat A captured civet in India Viverrids are native to sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, the Iberian Peninsula, southern China, South and Southeast Asia. Favoured habitats include woodland, savanna, and mountain biome. In consequence, many are faced with severe loss of habitat; several species are considered vulnerable and the otter civet is classified as endangered. Some species of civet are very rare and elusive and hardly anything is known about them, e.g., the Hose's civet, endemic to the montane forests of northern Borneo, is one of the world's least known carnivores.Mathai, J. (2010). \\"Hose's Civet: Borneo's mysterious carnivore\\". Nature Watch 18/4: 2-8. South Asia In Sri Lanka, the Asian palm civet species is known as \\"uguduwa\\" by the Sinhala-speaking community. The terms uguduwa and kalawedda are used interchangeably by the Sri Lankan community to refer to the same animal. However, the term kalawedda is mostly used to refer to another species in the civet family, the small Indian civet. Sri Lanka also has an endemic civet species called golden palm civet. Recently this species was split into 3 separate endemic species as Paradoxurus montanus, P. aureus, and P. stenocephalus. In Bangladesh and Bengali-speaking areas of India, civets are known as \\"khatash\\" () for the smaller species and \\"bagdash\\" () for the larger ones and is now extremely rare in Bangladesh (in the Khulna area of the country, the animal is also known as \\"shairel\\").

In Maharashtra marathi-speaking areas of India, civets are known as \\"Udmanjar\\" (). Diet Civets are unusual among feliforms, and carnivora in general, in that they are omnivores or even herbivores. Many species primarily eat fruit. Some also use flower nectar as a major source of energy. Coffee A caged civet Kopi luwak (also called caphe cut chon (fox-dung coffee), in Vietnam, and kape alamid, in the Philippines) is coffee that is prepared using coffee cherries that have been eaten and partly digested by the Asian palm civet, then harvested from its fecal matter. The civets digest the flesh of the coffee cherries but pass the pits (beans) inside, where stomach enzymes affect the beans, which adds to the coffee's prized aroma and flavor. can cost up to $600 in some parts of the world and about $100 a cup in others. This demand has led to civet farms on which the civets are fed a diet composed almost exclusively of such cherries, causing them to become severely malnourished. Farm conditions are also routinely described as deplorable. Filipino and Vietnamese oversight of these farms is non-existent. Relationship with humans The Malay civet is found in many habitats, including forests, secondary habitats, cultivated land, and the outskirts of villages, and is highly adaptable to human disturbances, including \\"selective logging\\" (partial forest removal).Jennings, A. P.; Seymour, A. S.; and Dunstone, N. (2006): \\"Ranging behaviour, spatial organization and activity of the Malay civet (Viverra tangalunga) on Buton Island, Sulawesi\\".

They are also seen as comparatively abundant options in the bushmeat trade. Urban environments Palm civets often venture into cities and suburbs, with people often complaining about civet faeces and the noise of the animals' climbing on roofs. Some studies have been undertaken to examine and mitigate such human‚Äìanimal conflict.\\"The great 'musang' stakeout\\", Wild Singapore, 2009.

During the Nigerian civil war, he moved to Harvard University. He was a founder of the Ibadan School that dominated the writing of the History of Nigeria until the 1970s. He is credited with \\"having played the leading role in creating a generation of African historians who could interpret their own history without being influenced by Eurocentric approaches.\\"Keith A. P. Sandiford, A Black Studies Primer: Heroes and Heroines of the African Diaspora, Hansib Publications, 2008, p. 151. Career Born in Awka, eastern Nigeria, Kenneth Onwuka Dike was educated in West Africa, England and Scotland. He attended Fourah Bay College, Sierra Leone and also Durham University for his BSc, the University of Aberdeen for his MA, and King's College London for his PhD. During the 1960s, as a member of the University of Ibadan's history department, he played a pioneering role in promoting African leadership of scholarly works published on Africa. As the head of the organizing committee of the First International Congress of Africanists in Ghana in 1963, he sought for a strengthened meticulous non- colonial focused African research, publication of research in various languages including indigenous and foreign, so as to introduce native speakers to history and for people to view African history through a common eye. He was the first director of International School Ibadan. In 1965 he was elected chairman of the Association of Commonwealth Universities. Ebere Nwaubani argues that Dike was the first modern scholarly proponent of Africanist history. His publications were a watershed in African historiography. With a PhD from London, Dike became the first African to complete Western historical professional training. At the University College of Ibadan, he became the first African professor of history and head of a history department. He founded the Nigerian National Archives, and helped in the founding of the Historical Society of Nigeria. His book Trade and Politics in the Niger Delta 1830-1885 dealt with 19th-century economics politics in the Niger Delta. He focused on internal African factors, especially defensive measures undertaken by the delta societies against imperialist penetration. Dike helped create the Ibadan School of African history and promoted the use of oral evidence by African historians.Ebere Nwaubani, \\"Kenneth Onwuka Dike, 'Trade And Politics,' and the Restoration of the African in History\\", History in Africa: A Journal of Method, 2000, Vol. 27, pp. 229-248  Publications  His publications include the following: Report on the Preservation and Administration of Historical Records in Nigeria (1953), Trade and Politics in the Nigeria Delta 1930-1890 (1956), A Hundred Years of British Rule in Nigeria (1957), The Origins of the Niger Missions (1958).

It is a remake of Y≈çjir≈ç Takita's Himitsu, a 1999 Japanese film produced by Yasuhiro Mase, written by Hiroshi Sait√¥. Plot Hannah (Lili Taylor) is fatally injured in a car accident; and her spirit migrates into the body of her unconscious daughter Samantha (Olivia Thirlby) when Hannah dies on a gurney next to her. Hannah resolves to keep her daughter's life running smoothly in preparation for her potential return. Hannah, living in Samantha's body, endeavors to keep up an emotional relationship with the husband/father, Ben (David Duchovny), which sometimes veers perilously close to becoming physical, to mutual horror. Her experience helps her to learn a lot about the previously unknown (to her) life her daughter was living and helps her to see how harrowing a teen's life can be in these times, as she struggles to walk the tightrope many teens must negotiate. She's confronted by conflicting pulls between the alluring attractions adolescents face every day and the demands of schoolwork that she finds largely unfamiliar to her, since a couple of decades have passed since her own graduation. As she discovers, Samantha's life has been a challenge to meet her parents' expectations for academic excellence and behavior in an acceptable range, all the while being overwhelmed by the hormones of adolescence, in many ways more powerful than any of the drugs the kids experiment with. It is at times difficult for her to keep that grip; but, for Ben, the possessiveness he feels toward his wife's soul in his daughter's body threatens to completely overwhelm his life as well as hers, with nearly disastrous results.

These Palestinian youth forged the new Palestinian musical subgenre, which blends Arabic melodies and hip hop beats. Lyrics are often sung in Arabic, Hebrew, English, and sometimes French. Since then, the new Palestinian musical subgenre has grown to include artists in Palestine, Israel, Great Britain, the United States and Canada. Borrowing from traditional rap music that first emerged in New York in the 1970s, \\"young Palestinian musicians have tailored the style to express their own grievances with the social and political climate in which they live and work.\\" Palestinian hip hop works to challenge stereotypes and instigate dialogue about the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. Palestinian hip hop artists have been strongly influenced by the messages of American rappers. Tamar Nafar says ‚Äúwhen I heard Tupac sing ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a White Man‚Äôs World‚Äù I decided to take hip hop seriously‚Äù. In addition to the influences from American hip hop, it also includes musical elements from Palestinian and Arabic music including ‚Äúzajal, mawwal, and saj‚Äù which can be likened to Arabic spoken word, as well as including the percussiveness and lyricism of Arabic music. Historically, music has served as an integral accompaniment to various social and religious rituals and ceremonies in Palestinian society (Al-Taee 47). Much of the Middle-Eastern and Arabic string instruments utilized in classical Palestinian music are sampled over Hip-hop beats in both Israeli and Palestinian hip-hop as part of a joint process of localization. Just as the percussiveness of the Hebrew language is emphasized in Israeli Hip-hop, Palestinian music has always revolved around the rhythmic specificity and smooth melodic tone of Arabic. ‚ÄúMusically speaking, Palestinian songs are usually pure melody performed monophonically with complex vocal ornamentations and strong percussive rhythm beats‚Äù.Al-Taee, Nasser. \\"Voices of Peace and the Legacy of Reconciliation: Popular Music, Nationalism, and the Quest for Peace in the Middle East.\\" Popular Music 21 (2002): 41‚Äì61. JSTOR. EBSCO. Brandeis University, Waltham. Apr 1. 2008. The presence of a hand-drum in classical Palestinian music indicates a cultural esthetic conducive to the vocal, verbal and instrumental percussion which serve as the foundational elements of Hip-hop. This hip hop is joining a ‚Äúlonger tradition of revolutionary, underground, Arabic music and political songs that have supported Palestinian Resistance‚Äù. This subgenre has served as a way to politicize the Palestinian issue through music. Themes Many Palestinian hip hop artists address themes that directly affect Palestinians in the occupied territories, living in Israel and those in exile. These artists use hip hop to address issues including patriarchy, drugs, violence, corruption and police brutality. Unlike the ideals of American rap, Palestinian rappers focus on exposing the lived conditions of the Palestinian people, especially the denial of Palestinian self-determination in their homeland. Palestinian nationalism is at the center of all Palestinian hip hop, regardless of the artists. The current living conditions of Palestinians living in the occupied Palestine and within Israel is addressed in the songs 'Who is the Terrorist' by DAM and \\"Free Palestine\\" by the Hammer Brothers. Rather than succumbing to the violence that surrounds them, Palestinian hip hop artists instead, attempt to spread their politically conscious messages to the world. Israel/Palestinian Conflict Palestinian rappers have been explicit in their criticism of the current situation between Israel and Palestine. The song \\"Who is the Terrorist\\" by DAM is the most explicit criticism of the relationship between Israel and Palestine. These rappers want to address the \\"paradox inherent in the notion of a state that claims to be both democratic and Jewish\\". Living conditions All Palestinian artists, regardless if they are within Palestine or abroad, have addressed their lived experience as Palestinians. For rapper Mahmoud who lives in Israel, he describes his experience as \\"whenever I walk the streets, my enemy steps to me in ignorance, he demands my ID, sees I‚Äôm an Arab. It drives him crazy. He begins to interrogate me, tells me I‚Äôm a suspected terrorist\\".Slingshot Hip Hop http://slingshothiphop.com Similarly, in the song, \\"Who Is The Terrorist\\", DAM describes the physical conditions, rapping: \\"Crawling on the ground, smelling the rotting bodies? Demolished homes, lost families, orphans, freedoms with handcuffs?\\". The Palestinian female rap duo from Acre, Israel, Arapeyat, address challenges among the Palestinian community by rapping \\"what‚Äôs happening to our society, we‚Äôre imprisoning ourselves, with crimes and drugs, we need to make change now\\". Establishment of an independent state Palestinian rappers have addressed the need and right to establish an independent Palestinian state in the Palestinian territories. For these rappers, \\"Palestinian liberation is obviously a key touchstone topic of identity...their music deals not just with issues of cultural identity but also of global politics\\".Massad, S. (2005). \\"Liberating Songs: Palestine Put to Music\\". In R. L. Stein & T. Swedenburg (eds.) Palestine, Israel, and the Politics of Popular Culture. Duke University Press. 175‚Äì201. Palestinian unity and pride For many Palestinian rappers, especially those in exile, their aim is to raise consciousness. In their song \\"Prisoner,\\" DAM raps, \\"our future is in our hands, there is still good in the world my brothers, the sky is wide open, take flight my brothers\\". The song \\"Born Here\\" delivers a similar message by saying \\"when we said hand in hand we should stand, we didn‚Äôt mean just a finger, cuz in order to achieve power we shall all be together\\". Despite location or overall theme, Palestinian rappers all support and wish to give hope to Palestinians. In his song \\"Sarah,\\" Emirati-Born Palestinian rapper Ortega Da ALCz who released a promotional track with Palestinian singer Rim Banna. Palestinian hip hop artists Palestinian hip hop is not limited to the Palestinian Territories. Rappers and hip hop groups that consider themselves Palestinian hip hop artists have emerged around the world. These \\"Arab and Palestinian American hip hop artists are part of a transnational hip hop movement that includes young artists in Palestine/Israel\\". In Gaza, Ortega Da ALC'z (Alhassan) who released many albums he lives in United Arab Emirates, MC Gaza (Ibrahim Ghunaim), Palestinian Rapperz and MWR rap about positive expression, everyday struggles, and the conditions of living in the occupied territories. Similarly, rappers Arapyat, Saz and The Happiness Kids discuss the experience of Palestinian youth in the West Bank. In Israel, DAM rap the experience of the Arabs who live in Israel. Internationally, Palestinian American rappers Excentrik, the Philistines, Iron Sheik, Ragtop and the Hammer Brothers all touch on themes of alleged racial profiling and discrimination against Arabs in the United States while expressing solidarity with Palestinians in the Palestinian Territories and in the diaspora. Refugees Of Rap Palestinian hip-hop group. Based in Paris, France, it Was in 2007, in a Palestinian refugee camp in Yarmouk, Syria, that the brothers, Yaser and Mohamed Jamous, created this group. Their texts offer a glimpse of life in the camp and denounce the situation in Syria . Shadia Mansour, a British-born female rapper, has brought attention to Palestinian hip hop in Europe along with others, Ettijah, a female rap group from Dheisheh Refugee Camp who are the first Palestinian female refugee rappers Media American filmmaker Jackie Salloum's 2008 feature-length documentary Slingshot Hip Hop traces the history and development of Palestinian hip hop in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip from the time DAM pioneered the art form in the late 1990s.

Her novels have enjoyed bestseller status in both the U.S. and U.K., and her short stories have won many awards and honors. Her book Pay It Forward was adapted into a movie and her novel Electric God is currently in development. Hyde's literary works are generally optimistic explorations of ordinary people, characters who are troubled or down-on-their-luck or recovering from past difficulties or abuse. Many feature journeys that parallel some of her own travels, life in New York City, small towns, and 'cross country' travels and explore settings often in those areas and the American West and Southwest. Hyde's Young writings and activities deal issues such as alcoholism, (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, TransGender) concerns, social service difficulties, etc.  Early life  Catherine Ryan Hyde was born in a family of writers, and lived during her early life in the Buffalo, New York area, and briefly lived in New York City, an influence which has often recurs in her writing in the form of being a setting for part of or the whole story arc. She attributes her changeover from \\"the last kid picked\\" on the team towards becoming a writer to a favorite teacher, Lenny Horowitz, who later died of liver cancer. After an accelerated graduation from high school at the age of 17, Hyde worked many jobs such as being a dog trainer, a tour guide at Hearst Castle, and working in a bakery prior to dedicating herself to become a full-time writer in the early 1980s. After relocating cross country to the Los Angeles area, she currently lives and writes and blogs from her home and areas around Cambria, California.http://www.randomhouse.com/author/results.pperl?authorid=59752  Early writing career: short stories and novels Early successes came from writing short stories, at one point racking up more than 122 rejections before being first published, and since then a total of more than 1500 rejections resulting in about 50 published stories. During this time, Hyde also wrote her first novel(s) Walter's Purple Heart, her first published Novel Funeral for Horses, and an anthology of 18 short stories, Earthquake Weather. A self- described literary writer, her breakthrough novel Pay It Forward was released in 1999 (Pocket Books) and quickly became a national bestseller, and was later adapted into the film Pay It Forward (Warner Brothers), which was released in 2000.  Pay It Forward  According to published interviews, the genesis of the idea for the novel came when Hyde's car caught fire in what she described as the \\"bad neighborhood\\" in which she lived, and two total strangers came to her assistance, then left before she could even thank them. Since then Pay It Forward, has been translated into twenty languages for publication in more than thirty countries, and was chosen among the Best Books for Young Adults in 2001 by the American Library Association and continues to be among her most popular and requested works. The movie Pay It Forward (Warner Brothers) was released theatrically in 2000, starring Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment. Pay It Forward, Young Reader's Edition was released on August 19, 2014. The new version tells the same story but was extensively revised to be more complementary to lesson plans, summer reading lists, etc. for students at a middle school grade level, that is, for students at approximately the same age and maturity level as the novel's main protagonist, Trevor McKinney. Other short stories and writings Her work has appeared in The Antioch Review, Michigan Quarterly Review, The Virginia Quarterly Review, The Sun, Ploughshares,http://www.pshares.org/authors/author-detail.cfm?authorID=6516 and Glimmer Train.

He was a follower of William of Ockham; he was censured by Pope Clement VI.Chapter Vii  Life and Writings  Very little is known of the life of John of Mirecourt, but it seems that he was born at Mirecourt in Lorraine between 1310-1315. He lectured at the Cistercian College of St. Bernard in Paris, and rose to the height of his philosophical and theological fame around the year 1345. He is credited with writing a commentary on Peter Lombard's Sentences, and two subsequent apologies which were responses to various criticisms of his commentary. He wrote two versions of his commentary; the first of which was attacked by a Benedictine called Johannes Normanus. Mirecourt replied by issuing a Declaratio in which he explained the meanings behind his propositions. Nevertheless, acting upon the recommendation of the faculty of theology at the University of Paris, Robert of Bardis, the University chancellor, condemned 41 propositions that were drawn from Mirecourt's writings on the Sentences. Mirecourt responded to this condemnation by writing a second apology to no avail: he was censured in Paris by Pope Clement VI in 1347. After this censure, nothing further is known of him, including any approximation as to the date of his death. There is some speculation that scholarly jealousy and academic politics made up a portion of the motivation behind Mirecourt's censure; and as Mirecourt was not radical in all of his philosophical views, it is not unsubstantiated that his censure was in part the result of some ill- will from various of the nominalist factions.  Philosophical thought  Knowledge and Intuition = Mirecourt reasoned that there are two kinds of certain knowledge: (1) 'the principle of non-contradiction,' and (2) 'the immediate intuition of one's existence'. The most undoubtedly of all things that can be known fall to this first kind of knowledge, as well as all analytic judgements that are reducible to it. Mirecourt distinguishes between two kinds of evidence of these kinds of knowledge: (1) special and (2) natural. Special evidence comes from the principle of non-contradiction, and natural evidence is that which is gained empirically. Mirecourt thought natural evidence to be weaker than special evidence because he understood God to be both absolutely powerful and the producer of miracles (as taken to be some occurrence outside of what is otherwise empirically observable). It is speculated that Mirecourt was censured due to his rigid views regarding the reliance of everything upon the will of God. Mirecourt held the view that anything physical or moral is wholly depended on the entirely free will of God. This was a controversial view because it held God responsible for willing not only all that is good, but also all that is not good. This stood in rather severe contradistinction to the commonly accepted view of Mirecourt's contemporaries which were centered on the premise of an all-good God. Mirecourt stated that some temptations cannot be overcome without a miracle from God. Such temptations included resisting the urge to have sexual relations with another man's wife. If this miracle is not given, Mirecourt argued that the action is then to be called neither adultery, nor a sin. Mirecourt is most well known for his theories on the infinite. He was chiefly concerned with species and perfections. God possessed the highest degree of perfection on his scale; and all creatures were infinitely distant from him. Mirecourt held that it is impossible to measure perfections because of the infinite distance they have from God. Thus, all that can be known is that any species either exceeds, or is exceeded by, some other species in a scale of perfections. = Nominalism = Mirecourt is generally thought to be a nominalist, and is often thought of as being a follower of William Ockham. Mirecourt rejected the idea of an imperfect intuitive cognition, however, which is a considerable departure from Ockham. The two, though, are generally in accord, especially with respect to their epistemological views. = Epistemology = Both Mirecourt and Ockham describe abstractive and intuitive cognition in very similar ways: both men think of knowledge as starting with intuitive cognition. Both men also distinguish between judgement and simple apprehension. In addition, both assert a need for close connections between a cognition and its object. = Influences = Mirecourt was chiefly influenced by the philosophy of Nicholas of Autrecourt, William Ockham, and to a minimal degree, Gregory of Rimini, and perhaps even Thomas Bradwardine. Nearly all of the major figures of Mirecourt's day accepted the basic tenets of nominalism, to some degree, and Mirecourt was no different in this respect. He was particularly influenced by the radical nominalist views of Nicholaus of Autrecourt, who was forced to burn his writings in 1347. References *G.

It is within the boundaries of three autonomous communities, Asturias, Cantabria and Castile and Le√≥n, which are represented on the body which runs the park. The park is also a popular destination for hikers and trekkers. History It was the first of the National Parks of Spain along with Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park in the Pyrenees. When it was created 22 July 1918 with help from Pedro Pidal, 1st Marquess of Villaviciosa de Asturias, it covered the western part of today's national park, centered on the Lakes of Covadonga. The Parque Nacional de la Monta√±a de Covadonga, as it then was called, had an area of 169.25 km¬≤. On May 30, 1995 the park was extended to include its current total area of 646.60 km¬≤. On July 9, 2003 UNESCO approved Biosphere Reserve status for the National Park. Picos de Europa is one of several biosphere reserves in the Cantabrian Mountains which are being integrated into a single super- reserve to be known as \\"Gran Cant√°brica\\". Biosphere Reserve Information, accessed 2010, when the super-reserve was described as being built up \\"step by step\\". Geography Lago Ercina, one of the Lakes of Covadonga. The total area of the park is 646.60 km¬≤ and is shared by Castilla y Le√≥n, Asturias, and Cantabria. The highest point of the park is in Torre de Cerredo peak, 2,648 m AMSL and the lowest point is 75 m AMSL in the Deva River, that is, a vertical drop of 2,573 m. The geological features of the park show the effects of glacial erosion on the limestone massifs that form the Cantabrian Mountains. Flora and fauna Several types of woods can be found in the area: trees include beeches and Cantabrian Holm Oaks. The human population is about 1300. There are many protected animal species, like the Cantabrian capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus cantabricus), the Bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), the Cantabrian brown bear and the Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus). The most representative animal of the Picos de Europa is the Cantabrian chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica parva) or rebeco, of which there are many sculptures around the park; as well as the Western Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica victoriae).

It was also known by its earlier name Kulturpark Pl√§nterwald Berlin. History The Ferris wheel in 2017 1969-1989 ‚Äì Kulturpark Pl√§nterwald The entertainment park was opened in 1969 as Kulturpark Pl√§nterwald, covering an area of 29.5 hectares. The area is situated in the north of the Pl√§nterwald, next to the river Spree. It was the only constant entertainment park in the GDR, and the only such park in either East or West Berlin. 1989-2001 ‚Äì Spreepark Berlin The VEB Kulturpark Berlin was completed in 1991, after the reunification, by mixed municipal authorities in Berlin. Out of a total of seven applicants, the Spreepark Berlin GmbH company received the contract. Crucially, the references of Norbert Witte of the company were not properly checked. Under the Spreepark GmbH, new attractions were added and visitor numbers reached 1.5 million per annum. Later, the concept was changed, and the park was gradually transformed into a more Western-style amusement park. An entrance fee (adults: 29 DM, children: 27 DM) covering all individual attractions was charged, instead of visitors paying for each individual ride, as had previously been the case. The asphalted surface around the Ferris wheel was taken up and converted into a water landscape. Roller coasters, two game water courses, a stage, a Western town and an English village were later added to the park. Beginning 1999, the park had to cope with large debts. The increase in the admission fee to 30 DM per person and the lack of parking contributed to a drop in visitor numbers, until, in 2001, only 400,000 visitors entered the park. In 2001, Spreepark GmbH announced that they were insolvent. After 2002 On 18 January 2002, Norbert Witte, together with his family and closest coworkers, moved to Lima, Peru. They shipped six attractions (Fliegender Teppich, Butterfly, Spider, Baby-Flug, Wild River, and Jet Star) in 20 shipping containers, having been allowed to do so by the authorities, who believed they were being sent for repair. Since 2002, the park has not opened for visitors. In August 2002, the park was declared insolvent. Debts at a level of ‚Ç¨11,000,000 remained, and the area was allowed to fall into disrepair. The Ferris wheel still stands but has not operated since the park's closure; likewise, the remains of other attractions can still be found on-site. In 2011, a scene for the action film Hanna was filmed at the park,http://movies.about.com/od/hanna/a/joe-wright-interview.htm as well as the music video for the single \\"Run Dry\\" by German band Sizarr.Official video on the Vimeo channel of directors Tim Main & Joe Dixon Norbert Witte failed in his attempt to run a \\"Lunapark\\" in Lima. On 19 May 2004, he was sentenced to seven years in jail for attempting to smuggle 180 kg of cocaine with a value of ¬£14 million from Peru to Germany in the masts of the Fliegender Teppich (Flying Carpet) ride.The week that was: World - Times Online In October 2006, a Peruvian court sentenced Wittes' son, Marcel Witte, to 20 years for drug smuggling. After 2011, guided tours were offered to the public at restricted times. In March 2014, the City of Berlin bought the Spreepark, and guided tours ended. The city chose Gr√ºn Berlin to restore the park, and their plan, presented to the public in 2018, is to restore it with an overlay of cultural and ecological content. On the evening of 10 August 2014, major parts of the park were destroyed in a fire. Reports indicated that firefighters discovered two blazes 200 m apart that soon merged. This indicates the fires may have been deliberately set.

Different types of tower were developed and built at different locations, like the series FMT 1 to FMT 16. The individual series differ in each case in the number of antenna platforms and the size of the operating projectile. The types FMT 7 to 10 are without pulpit. The type towers were usually designed on the basis of economic and functional criteria and only secondarily for aesthetics. Compared with structural steelworks, the reinforced concrete construction way is easier in the establishment and maintenance. In Germany there are about 300 towers of this type. The establishment of these towers began in the mid-1960s, when the Federal Postal Administration developed its radio relay system clearly. In the planning of the type towers engineer Fritz Leonhardt and the architect Erwin Heinle were considerably involved. Examples of type towers are among other things: K√∂terberg (FMT 1), Ober-Olm (FMT 1/72), H√ºfingen (FMT 1/73), Karlsruhe- Gr√ºnwettersbach (FMT 2), Waldenbuch (FMT 2/72), Hoherodskopf (FMT 2/73), Hemmoor (FMT 2/81), Hunau (FMT 3), Bielefeld (FMT 3/72), Gramschatzer Wald (FMT 5), Cleebronn (FMT 6), Seesen (FMT 7), Heidenheim an der Brenz (FMT 8), Saarlouis (FMT 8/73), Landau (FMT 9), Lahr/Schwarzwald (FMT 10), Fehmarn (FMT 11), sending refuge (FMT 12), Moers (FMT 13), Blauen (FMT 14), Sch√∂ppingen (FMT 15), Hamburg-Bergedorf (FMT 16) The communications towers in M√ºnster, Kiel, Bremen and Cuxhaven were planned by an architect of the regional directorate Kiel and actually do not belong to this type of tower. They are therefore called Sondert√ºrme, to which e.g. also the Rheinturm, the Heinrich- Hertz-Turm and the Fremersbergturm belong. In addition, the telecommunication tower Koblenz reminded strongly of the type towers FMT 11 to 13, is a special tower, since it is larger substantially more highly and the pulpit than with the type towers.

The CT-134 was a single engine, low-wing, four-seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear and a limited aerobatic capability. Design and development In the early 1960s the Royal Canadian Air Force‚Äôs standard elementary training aircraft was the de Havilland DHC-1 Chipmunk. Flight instruction was completed by student pilots on the DHC-1 before they progressed to the then-brand-new Canadair CT-114 Tutor jet trainer. A decision was made by RCAF HQ to remove the DHC-1s from service and not replace them, as it was felt that the CT-114 was easy enough to fly that initial training was not needed. The CT-114 quickly developed a wash-out rate of near 95% amongst student jet pilots and it was clear that an elementary trainer was needed. Due to the RCAF's previous customer relationship with Beechcraft while operating that company's Expeditor twin-engine aircraft, a hasty purchase of twenty-four B23 Musketeers was made in 1971. The first CT-134 arrived at CFB Portage la Prairie on March 23, 1971.Milberry, Larry: Sixty Years - The RCAF and Air Command 1924‚Äì1984, page 384. McGraw Hill Ryerson Canav Books, 1984. The new trainers were designated CT-134 Musketeer in the then Canadian Armed Forces. The aircraft purchased were standard Model B23s equipped with the O-360-A4G engine of , modified by the addition of a cowling strake, horizontal stabilizer strake and ventral fin to improve spin recovery performance. They were initially serial numbered as 13401-13424, but were re-numbered 134001-134024 to avoid confusion with other CF aircraft serial numbers. The initial batch of CT-134s was replaced in late 1981 with a purchase of twenty-four more aircraft. These were 1982 model Beechcraft C23 Sundowners and were designated by the CF as CT-134A Musketeer II. These were numbered 134025-134048. The CT-134 was approved for limited aerobatics, including loops, rolls, chandelles and lazy eightsDAOT: C-12-134-000/MC-000 Canadian Forces Technical Order Operating Checklist Musketeer CT 134,, CFTMPC, 10 Jul 79 Operational history CT-134As from 3 Canadian Forces Flying Training School at CFB Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, 1982 Both batches of Musketeers served with 3 Canadian Forces Flying Training School and the Canadian Forces Flying Instructor School at CFB Portage la Prairie Manitoba and the Canadian Forces Central Flying School in Winnipeg until they were replaced by Slingsby Fireflys operated under contract by Bombardier Aerospace in 1992. During their 21 years of service the CT-134 and CT-134A fleet at 3 CFFTS trained about 5000 Canadian military pilot graduates. In operational service the CT-134 suffered very few accidents. One of the few serious accidents occurred on 23 March 1990 when Musketeer 134229 had an engine failure on take-off from Erickson Municipal Airport at Erickson, Manitoba, while giving familiarization flights to Royal Canadian Air Cadets. The accident was caused by fuel starvation and the aircraft was written off.Milberry, Larry: Aircom: Canada's Air Force, pages 82‚Äì83. Canav Books, 1991. Maintenance of the CT-134 fleet was primarily carried out by the CFB Portage la Prairie Base Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Organization, with Depot Level Inspection and Repair (DLIR) being conducted by Field Aviation at Calgary International Airport in Calgary, Alberta. Upon retirement the CT-134s and CT-134As were not sold for flying use due to the structural problems they all suffered from years of aerobatics. Instead they were donated to museums or used for air force and civil maintenance training. Some CT-134s still serve as monuments at a few current and former Canadian Forces Bases as well as Royal Canadian Legion halls, a distinction held by very few light aircraft in this class. In Canadian military service the aircraft was referred to by student and instructor pilots by the nickname Muskrat.

In the 1990s the company was privatised and a number of businesses became separate entities - the remainder were grouped under the 'ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá Holding d.d.' group. History=Background In 1921 the company Prva jugoslavenska tvornica vagona strojeva i mostova dd Brod na Savi (First Yugoslavian wagon, machinery and bridge factory company, Brod on the Sava) was established, with 125000 shares of 400 crowns. The factory buildings were constructed by 1922.ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá, company website, \\"History\\", (Croatian language), March 2012 Croatian industrialist Aleksandar Ehrmann was leading in attracting foreign investment into the firm in 1923. In 1926 the company constructed its first bridge (over the Tisza near Titel), and its first railway vehicle, and first steam boiler. In 1928 the company produced its first tram (for Belgrade). Development of the company continued in the 1930s with the factory beginning to produce vessels for the chemical industry, cranes, and powered railway vehicles. During the Invasion of Yugoslavia of 1941 the factory was heavily damaged. Post World War II the factory employed 1330 people (1945), after reconstruction of the war damaged buildings it was renamed ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá Industrija ≈°inskih vozila, industrijskih i energetskih postrojenja i ƒçeliƒçnih konstrukcija Slavonski Brod in 1947, after Brod born communist politician ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá. In the 1950s the company entered into a collaboration with Babcock & Wilcox (1952), and manufactured its first diesel engine (1955), the company also manufactured railway vehicles for domestic use and for export. The company workforce expanded from 2500 (1952) to over 4500 by 1964; by 1969 the factory had become a major boiler and steel structure manufacturer. During this period the plant began manufacturing GM-EMD locomotives under license. In the 1970s the company's interest were extended to nuclear power plant manufacturing - the company was involved in the construction of the Kr≈°ko Nuclear Power Plant. Other large scale industrial construction projects included construction of Sugar and Cement factories, and an association with Belgian boiler manufacturer Wanson was formed. A company manufacturing industrial scale expansion joints was established in 1974 in association with Teddington Bellows (UK). During the 1980s the company diversified into production of agricultural machinery (in association with Deutz-Fahr), vending machines, seamless cylinders (e.g. gas cylinders), and began serial production of the M-84 tank in 1983. Involvement in construction of railway vehicles (including liquified gas wagons), factories, and power plants also continued.

He was born on 7 November 1812 in the coastal town of Moratuwa. He left Moratuwa at the age of 13 and stayed in Ratnapura with his uncle, who was the first Sinhalese proctor, and moved to the Uva province. In early 1847, he met and married Bandara Menike, the daughter of Gunnepana Arachchi in Kandy. He was captured by the British after the failure of Matale Rebellion along with Gongalegoda Banda and Ven. Kudapola Thera. He was executed by a firing squad on August 8, 1848.

This was successful. However, the other leaders who attacked Kurunegala and Wariyapola failed.

After a fight and thrashing the village headman from Lakshapathiya, he fled from Moratuwa in 1825 at the age of 13. He traveled about the country, mostly the hill country ‚Äì Haldummulla to Badulla and other places. His uncle, W. Marcellenus Franciscu Fernando, was the first Sinhalese proctor who had a flourishing practice at Ratnapura and in 1840 Francisco stayed with himhttp://www.list.lk/weera-puran-appu.htmb#.Uh9mTX9nadY It was at this stage of his career that he headed a band of outlaws and initiated a reign of terror against European planters and officials in Uva, much to the delight of His people, His daring exploits against the white men soon made him a legendary hero in Sri Lanka. He was now convinced of the necessity of driving away the British from the country in order to emancipate the people from the hardships and humiliations they suffered under the foreign yoke. With this end in view, he conferred with the Sangha of Mahiyangana and Muthiyangana who pledged him their support. This was in 1845. About this time he encountered romance and lost his heart to a highland lass, Bandara Menike of Harispattuwa whom he married in 1847. She bore him a daughter. Francisco was now called Puran Appu. He broke into House of Magistrate Dawson of Badulla and was imprisoned and then broke prison. He cursed Major Rodgers who brought a false charge against him and Major Rodgers was struck by lightning in Nuwara Eliya.

In 1437 Crichton, as Keeper of Edinburgh, had control of the six-year-old James II and by 1439 had himself proclaimed Lord Chancellor of Scotland. During the King's minority, Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Douglas was Regent. In 1440, after his death, Crichton and Sir Alexander Livingston invited the 16-year-old William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas and his brother to dinner in Edinburgh Castle, and murdered them, despite the young King's pleas for their lives.the 6th Earl of Douglas, his brother David This brutal incident of murder and betrayal of hospitality has become known as the ‚ÄòBlack Dinner‚Äô and was an inspiration for the famous \\"Red Wedding\\" massacre in the Game of Thrones series.http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/06/02/game-of-thrones-author-george-r-r- martin-why-he-wrote-the-red-wedding/2/ Crichton was sent in 1448 to the continent, accompanied by the Secretary of State, John de Ralston Bishop of Dunkeld and Nicholas Otterburn who would latterly assume that position. The purpose of this embassy was not only to ratify the Auld Alliance between Scotland and France, but to find a bride for the as yet unmarried King James. Crichton and his company proceeded on to the Duchy of Burgundy, where they negotiated with Duke Philip for a suitable match for the King. Mary of Guelders, daughter of Arnold, Duke of Guelders, and niece of Duke Philip was chosen. Crichton escorted the future Queen back to Scotland, where they landed at Leith on 18 June 1449.Balfour Paul, vol iii, p 60 In 1450 he made a considerable loan to James II.

Powers Hapgood (1899‚Äì1949) was an American trade union organizer and Socialist Party leader known for his involvement with the United Mine Workers in the 1920s. Biography=Early years Powers Hapgood was born on December 28, 1899, the son of William Powers Hapgood, a Progressive canning factory owner in Indianapolis, and his wife, the former Eleanor Page.\\"Finding Aid for the Powers Hapgood Papers,\\" Lilly Library Manuscript Collections, University of Indiana. Retrieved February 19, 2010. Hapgood graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts in 1917 and enrolled in Harvard University, from which he earned his Bachelor's Degree in 1921. Even prior to graduation, Hapgood had spent time experiencing the life of the working class first hand. During the fall and early winter of 1920, he spent nearly four months working his way across the western United States. Hapgood worked as a miner at Hibbing, Minnesota, on the Northern Pacific Railroad and in a Montana sugar beet factory. Upon graduation, Hapgood decided to dedicate his life to mobilizing the working-class. Hapgood went to work as an organizer for the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) in 1922.\\"Hapgood, Harvard Graduate, Forsakes Eliot's Advice,\\" The Challenge [Chicago], vol. 1, no. 3 (June 1933), pg. 3. Hapgood was instrumental in organizing non-union coal mines in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, during the Somerset Coal Strike of 1922‚Äì23, especially mines at Jerome, Boswell and Gray.Robert Bussel, From Harvard to the Ranks of Labor: Powers Hapgood and the American Working Class. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999; pp. 43‚Äì63. Hapgood later aided John Brophy in his challenge to John L. Lewis for the leadership of the UMWA, a failed attempt which ultimately led to the ouster of both Hapgood and Brophy from the Union. Following his ouster, Hapgood subsequently went abroad and worked himself as a miner in South Wales, France, Germany, and Soviet Russia. He finally returned to Pennsylvania again and became active in the UMWA. Hapgood was elected to the August 1927 annual convention of the UMWA as a delegate of the union's local from Cresson, Pennsylvania. Hapgood's presence at the scene of the convention was greeted by the UMWA officialdom with physical force, in which a false telephone message lured Hapgood into a hotel room where he was met by three toughs. A brawl ensued, which was interrupted by the hotel manager, who called the police. Hapgood refused to be bullied into retreating from the UMWA convention, but with union leader Lewis firmly ensconced in his position of power by that gathering, in the aftermath Hapgood decided to depart the Pennsylvania mine fields. Instead, Hapgood went to work as a longshoreman to support himself. In his free time, Hapgood spoke on behalf of the Sacco-Vanzetti Defense Committee in an effort to rally support in defense of two Italian-American anarchists accused of murder committed in the act of robbing a New England shoe factory. On December 28, 1927, Hapgood married Mary Donovan (d. Aug. 1973), the Secretary of the Sacco-Vanzetti Defense Committee. The couple had a daughter, Barta Donovan, in 1929 and adopted a son in 1930. Political career Powers Hapgood joined the Socialist Party of America in 1926. In 1928, he campaigned for his wife in her race for Governor of Massachusetts, heading the state Socialist Party ticket. Hapgood ran for Governor of Indiana on the Socialist Party ticket in 1932, losing to Paul V. McNutt. In the early 1930s, Hapgood was an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union. Hapgood was the New England secretary for the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) during the middle 1930s, a position which landed him in jail for two months in 1937 for contempt of court for his role in continuing a strike of shoe-workers in Lewiston and Auburn in the wake of an injunction forbidding strike activity. Hapgood worked as an organizer for the CIO throughout the rest of the 1930s. From 1941 to 1947, Hapgood was named the CIO's regional director for Indiana. In 1948, he became an assistant to Allen Haywood, a vice president of the CIO and head of its national organization efforts. Death and legacy Powers Hapgood died February 4, 1949. Robert Bussel, in his biography of Hapgood, wrote that Hapgood died from a heart attack while driving his car on Feb. 4, 1949.Bussel, From Harvard to the Ranks of Labor, pg. 197. German-American author (and fellow Indiana native) Kurt Vonnegut pays homage to Hapgood in his novel Jailbird. Powers Hapgood's papers are housed at the Lilly Library at the Indiana University in Bloomington.

He was convicted for war crimes after the war. During World War I, he was a flying ace who claimed shooting down twenty planes and an airship; he was credited with thirteen of those claims. Early life He was born in Wyk auf F√∂hr, Province of Schleswig-Holstein, into an old seafaring family, the son of a sea captain. The generations-long seafaring tradition within his family charted an obvious course for his future. In 1895 he joined the merchant marine, serving for 7 years and volunteering in 1901 for MTBs.Franks et al., p. 92. After one year, he returned to the merchant marine, serving several years aboard the 5-masted Preussen (at the time, the largest sailing ship in the world,) as Second Officer. In 1913 he decided to deviate from this career, and learned to fly. Having graduated and gaining licence No. 707, he became a flying instructor at a civilian flying school. Service during World War I Christiansen in 1918 In August 1914, Christiansen was called up and posted to Zeebrugge as naval aviator. He flew Hansa-Brandenburg W.12 seaplanes over the North Sea, the English Channel, and Britain. For his bombing missions on Dover and Ramsgate, he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class. From 1915 to 1916 Christiansen went on numerous reconnaissance and bombing missions, helping to make his unit at Zeebrugge one of the most successful in the German Naval Air Service. On 27 April 1916, as Leutnant der Matrosen Artillerie (Lieutenant of Naval Artillery,) Christiansen was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class and Knights Cross with Swords of the House Order of Hohenzollern. Christiansen claimed his first air-to-air victory 15 May 1917 by shooting down a Sopwith Pup off Dover. On 1 September 1917 he took command of Naval Air Station at Zeebrugge, and being promoted to Oberleutnant zur See, shot down a Porte FB2 Baby off Felixstowe the same day. On 11 December 1917 he shot down the non- rigid coastal class airship C-27, Cdr. Flight Lieutenant John Francis Dixon, DSC, near the Belgian coast.Franks et al., pp. 92‚Äì93. Christiansen continued to carry out reconnaissance, rescue, and bombing missions, such that by December 1917, he had completed 440 missions, including shooting down Airship C27. At this time he was also awarded the Pour le M√©rite (\\"Blue Max\\"), the first of only three given to naval aviators and the only one to a seaplane pilot.O'Connor, p. 50. He was promoted to Kapit√§nleutnant in 1918. On 15 February 1918 Christiansen shot down a Curtiss H12B flying boat off Felixstowe, followed by 2 more on 24 April and 25 April. In June he claimed three more Felixstowe F2As. On 6 July he surprised and damaged British submarine in the Thames estuary, killing its captain and five crewmen (the submarine reached harbour). By 11 November 1918 he raised his personal tally to 13,The Aerodrome forum as well as some shared victories, which cumulatively may have brought his total to 21. Activity between wars Following the German Revolution of late 1918, Christiansen was a member of the 3rd Marinebrigade commanded by Wilfried von Loewenfeld. In 1922 Christiansen was active again in the merchant marine, as ship's captain. He continued in this pursuit until 1929, when he was employed as a pilot by the Claude Dornier Company. While with Dornier, he flew what was at the time the largest seaplane in the world, the Dornier Do X on its maiden Atlantic flight to New York in 1930.Franks et al., p. 93. Christiansen's distinguished career led him eventually to being called to a post in the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM/Reich Aviation Ministry) from 1933 to 1937, and in 1936 he was promoted to Generalmajor. On 15 April 1937 he was appointed Korpsf√ºhrer of the National Socialist Flyers Corps, or NSFK. He was also promoted to Generalleutnant. On 1 January 1939 he was named General der Flieger. Service during World War II From 29 May 1940 until 7 April 1945 Christiansen was Wehrmachtbefehlshaber in den Niederlanden (Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht in the Netherlands), and until 26 June 1943 was concurrently still Korpsf√ºhrer of the NSFK. In addition, from 10 November 1944 until 28 January 1945 supreme commander of the 25th Army. Christiansen also was responsible for the food embargo in winter 1944, causing famine in western Holland resulting in the death of 22000 civilian men, women and children. After the war Christiansen was arrested for war crimes. On 2 October 1944 he had ordered a raid on the village of Putten in Gelderland, the Netherlands, in retaliation, after one of his officers, a Leutnant Sommers, was killed there by the Dutch resistance. When he heard about the actions of the resistance near Putten, Christiansen is reported to have said, \\"Das ganze Nest muss angesteckt werden und die ganze Bande an die Wand gestellt!\\" (\\"Put them all against the wall and burn the place down!\\") In compliance with this retributive sentiment, several members of the civilian population were shot, the village was burned, and 661 of the males of the town were deported to labor camps, the vast majority of whom never returned. Christiansen was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment in 1948 in Arnhem for war crimes but was released in December 1951. He died in Aukrug in 1972. His release from imprisonment in 1951 was an occasion for his native town, Wyk auf F√∂hr, to renew Christiansen's honorary citizenship and reinstate a street name in his honor, previously changed by the British military administration in 1945. These honors sparked controversies in Germany and the Netherlands and they were revoked in 1980 by the town council.

The total Wildlife Management Area is 36 sq km. It is located approximately 20 km directly north of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, near the town of Stonewall, Manitoba in the Rural Municipality of Rockwood. Oak Hammock Marsh is listed as a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention, and is also a globally significant Important Bird Area. History The marsh is a remnant of an originally 470 sq km area of marsh and fen near the south-western corner of Lake Winnipeg. This larger marsh had the original English name of St. Andrews Bog. But the original wetland underwent drainage for agricultural purposes beginning in 1897, and by the early 1960s all but 60 ha had been drained. Measures to restore a portion of the wetland began in 1967 when the Governments of Manitoba and Canada embarked on a cooperative program with Ducks Unlimited Canada and other wildlife conservation organizations to restore marginal agricultural lands to a state suitable for wildlife. By 1974, 3,450 ha of land had been purchased and 22 km of dykes built to trap and hold water in three dyke-separated marsh compartments. In addition, 58 nesting islands were constructed within the three compartments. In 1984, the Manitoba government signed a further development agreement with Ducks Unlimited Canada to construct water control structures, water supply works, more nesting islands, additional dykes, and create a fourth compartment. Management The marsh is a re-constructed and managed wetland, designed for the creation of a waterfowl breeding and migratory habitat. Water levels in the marsh are carefully controlled. It is common during wet years (when waterfowl have an abundance of alternative nesting sites) for the water level in one or more of the compartments to be lowered for the summer, creating an extensive area of dried mudflats. This drying and later reflooding promotes the growth of emergent marsh plants such as bulrush and cattail, and therefore maintains the vegetation cover of the marsh; otherwise, the natural tendency would be for the marsh to become over several years simply a shallow lake, with a sharply defined shoreline and little nesting cover. Furthermore, not all of the adjacent purchased land has been allowed to grow wild. Cereal grain crops are planted in some of it, in order to supply migrating waterfowl with an autumn food supply while reducing crop losses on local farms. Hunting Critics contend that the marsh is simply a \\"duck factory\\" for the benefit of hunters. Supporters believe that it would be unrealistic to expect that the required funds to recreate the marsh would have been forthcoming if wild ducks had no economic and recreational value to sportsmen. Oak Hammock Marsh, like other prairie wetlands, supports many wildlife species besides game birds. The marsh itself is closed to hunting, but game birds (primarily mallards, snow geese, and Canada geese) are hunted in the autumn when they leave the marsh to feed in the surrounding grain fields. The waterfowl is additionally protected by a buffer zone extending 1 km from the water inside which hunting is prohibited, this protection extending outside of the WMA in some locations. Ducks Unlimited Canada national office The western shore of the marsh is home to Ducks Unlimited Canada's national head office, in a building that also serves as a public Interpretive Centre for the marsh. Boardwalks from the Interpretive Centre allow public access to the marsh and dykes. The building of a head office and public facility so close to critical wildlife habitat was the cause of controversy in the 1980s. Opponents believed the traffic associated with the building would disturb the wildlife. These concerns have proven unfounded, as the wildlife have since grown quite accustomed to the building and its people (the building's roof is now a popular nesting site).

Set in what might loosely be described as an alternative Spain, the novel traces a family of painters who, by nature of their Gifts, can influence events around them. In the Grijalva family, the Gifted males are usually sterile and short-lived; the women, who may have a talent for painting, but do not have the Gift for the particular type of painting that alters what it portrays, are generally kept within the family to produce children. However, one woman per generation is official mistress to the ruling Duke's Heir, so that the family maintains its influence at Court. The story develops when a particularly Gifted and unscrupulous Grijalva painter finds a way to continue living through successive generations. As the political and social climate changes, including revolutions in neighboring countries and democratic challenges to the ruling Dukes, this increasingly conservative painter seeks to hold on to the past, and especially his first love, whom he has imprisoned in a painting. Throughout the book, special emphasis is placed on iconography and a set of possibly Arabic/Moorish spells that bend events to the will of the painter. The connection between the ruling Dukes and the Grijalva family is shown to be more far-reaching and subtle than at first appears. The development in painting styles is used as a metaphor for political changes that mirror western European history, especially in France and Italy from 1500 to (say) 1820. The succession of paintings in the ducal gallery (which turns into the national gallery) is the lens through which we see the historical and personal events that make up this fantasy history. Further plans The original plan for The Golden Key was that it would lead to three more novels, one by each of the authors. Melanie Rawn would write The Diviner (or The Diviner's Key), Kate Elliott would write The Warrior, and Jennifer Roberson would write The Seeker. The Diviner has been published in August 2011, but plans for the other two books are respectively described as \\"cancelled\\" and \\"on indefinite hold.\\" ReferencesExternal links * A review of the novel.

It breeds in Sub-Saharan Africa from Sierra Leone and southern Sudan south into eastern South Africa. It is partially migratory with South African birds wintering further north. West African birds leave the north of the breeding range in the dry season. Habitat This is a bird of wooded, mainly lowland habitats. The lesser prefers less open habitats, and is replaced in montane grassland by the greater striped swallow, Hirundo cucullata. It is common and often found around human habitation. Description H. a. unitatis in flight in KwaZulu- Natal The lesser striped swallow is 15‚Äì10 cm long. It has dark blue upperparts with a red rump and a rufous-chestnut crown, nape and sides of the head. The underparts are white with dark streaking, and the upper wings and underwing flight feathers are blackish-brown. The underwing coverts are tawny. The blackish tail has very long outer feathers; these are slightly longer in the male than the female. Juveniles are duller and browner, with less contrast and shorter outer tail feathers. There are five or six subspecies differing in the extent of the underpart streaking. The lesser striped swallow has heavier and darker underparts striping, a deeper red rump, and a brighter head colour than the larger greater striped swallow. Habits It feeds mainly on flying insects, but has been known to eat small fruits. The flight is erratic, and the call is a nasal zeh zeh zeh zeh zeh. Nesting The lesser striped swallow builds a bowl-shaped mud nest with a tubular entrance on the underside of a suitable structure. The nest has a soft lining, and may be reused in later years. The nest may be built in a cave or under a rock overhang or a tree branch. This species has benefited from its willingness to use buildings, bridges, culverts and similar structures.

Incubation is by the female alone for 14‚Äì16 days to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 17‚Äì19 days, but the young birds will return to the nest to roost for a few days after the first flight.

Originally established in 1830, the Serbian army was incorporated into the newly established state of Yugoslavia in 1918. The current Serbian army has been active since 2006 when Serbia restored its independence. HistoryCurrent status The Serbian Army is the largest component of the Serbian Armed Forces. There are approximately 17,850 active members and additional 50,000 in reserves. The army is composed entirely of professionals and volunteers following the suspension of mandatory military service on January 1, 2011. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th army brigades are tasked with securing the 5 km (2.5 mi) wide Ground Safety Zone (GSZ) along the administrative line between Central Serbia and the disputed territory of Kosovo. The Ground Safety Zone extends 384 kilometres long and covers a total area of about 1,920 square kilometres. There are over 20 camps and security checkpoints in the zone.

In the 1950s, he became the first black person to be featured regularly on television in the United Kingdom,\\"Cy Grant: Actor, Singer and Writer\\", The Times (London), 16 February 2010.Gus John, \\"Cy Grant obituary\\", The Guardian (London), 18 February 2010.Kurt Barling, \\"Cy Grant: Pioneer for black British actors\\" (obituary), The Independent (London), 27 February 2010. mostly due to his appearances on the BBC current affairs show Tonight. Following service in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Grant worked as an actor and singer, before establishing the Drum Arts Centre in London in the 1970s. In the 1980s, he was appointed director of Concord Multicultural Festivals. A published poet and author of several books, including his 2007 memoir Blackness and the Dreaming Soul and other writing that reflected his belief in Taoism and an expansive world view, Grant was made an Honorary Fellow of Roehampton University in 1997, and a member of the Scientific and Medical Network in 2001. In 2008, he was the founder and inspirator of an online archive to trace and commemorate Caribbean airmen of the Second World War. A father of four children, Grant lived with his wife, Dorith, in Highgate, London. Early life Cy Grant was born in the village of Beterverwagting, British Guiana (modern-day Guyana), one of seven children in a close-knit middle-class family. His father was a Moravian minister and his mother a music teacher originally from Antigua. Grant had two brothers and four sisters.Vinette K. Price, \\"Britain lauds Grant, a trailblazing Guyanese\\", Caribbean Life, 12 May 2016. At the age of 11, he moved with his family to New Amsterdam, Berbice. After leaving high school, Grant worked as a clerk in the office of a stipendiary magistrate but was unable to study law overseas due to a lack of funds. Speaking of his upbringing, Grant said: \\"I was brought up in a typically colonial way, singing 'Rule Britannia' and learning about English history and geography, but not knowing anything about the country I was born in. I knew as a young person in Guyana that something was wrong.... I felt frustrated by the colonial way of life. I knew that the colony was too small to hold me.\\"Stephen Bourne, \\"Cy Grant ‚Äî Into the Wind\\", in The Motherland Calls: Britain's Black Servicemen & Women, 1939-45, The History Press, 2012, quoting Jim Pines (ed.), Black and White in Colour: Black People in British Television Since 1936 (BFI Publishing, 1992), pp. 43‚Äì44. Military service In 1941, Grant joined the Royal Air Force, which had extended recruitment to non-white candidates following heavy losses in the early years of the Second World War. One of approximately 500 young men recruited from the Caribbean as aircrew, he was commissioned as an officer after training in England as a navigator. He joined 103 Squadron, based at RAF Elsham Wolds in Lincolnshire, becoming one of a seven-man crew of an Avro Lancaster. In 1943, on his third operation, Flight Lieutenant Grant was shot down over The Netherlands during the Battle of the Ruhr. He parachuted to safety into a field (south of Nieuw- Vennep, as he later found out) and was helped by a Dutch family, although a policeman subsequently handed him over to the German forces, and for the next two years Grant was imprisoned in Stalag Luft III camp, east of Berlin.Alec Lom, \\"The men of bomber command: the navigator, Cy Grant\\", The Telegraph, 24 October 2008. (The camp is best known for two famous prisoner escapes that took place there by tunnelling, which were depicted in the films The Great Escape (1963) and The Wooden Horse (1950), and the books by former prisoners Paul Brickhill and Eric Williams from which these films were adapted.) Grant was eventually liberated by the Allied Forces in 1945. One of those who in 1943 had rushed to the scene of the crash in the Dutch village was a then 11-year-old local called Joost Klootwijk, who in later years determined to find out what happened to the crew, and eventually made contact with Grant around 2007.Kurt Barling, \\"Remembering Cy Grant\\", Barling's London, BBC News, 28 February 2010. BBC London Special Correspondent Kurt Barling made a film in 2008 of Grant returning after 65 years to the Netherlands, where Grant and Klootwijk had an emotional meeting for the first time.Kurt Barling, \\"Failed to Return\\", BBC London, 28 October 2014. In 2007, Grant participated in the filming of the documentary Into the Wind (2011), in which he discusses his experiences as an RAF navigator.\\"Into the Wind: The story of Bomber Command\\", BBC Lincolnshire, 19 April 2010. Showbusiness career After the war, Grant decided to pursue his original ambition to study law, perceiving it as a means to challenge racism and social injustice. He became a member of the Middle Temple in London and qualified as a barrister in 1950. However, despite his distinguished war record and legal qualifications, he was unable to find work at the Bar and decided to take up acting. Aside from earning a living, he saw acting as a way to improve his diction in preparation for when he finally entered Chambers.Black History, Issue 365 , Spring/Summer 2009, Interview with Cy Grant by Angela Cobbinah. Grant's first acting role was for a Moss Empires tour in which he starred in a play titled 13 Death St., Harlem. His career received a boost after he successfully auditioned for Laurence Olivier and his Festival of Britain Company, which led to appearances at the St. James Theatre in London and the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City (alongside Jan Carew).Angela Cobbinah, \\"Novelist Jan Carew ‚Äì The Soldier Savant\\", 30 July 2009. Aware of the short supply of roles for black actors, Grant decided to increase his earning potential by becoming a singer, having learnt to sing and play the guitar during his childhood in Guiana. This proved to be a successful undertaking and Grant soon appeared in revues and cabaret venues such as Esmeralda's Barn, singing Caribbean and other folk songs, as well as on BBC radio (The Third Programme and the Overseas Service). In 1956 he hosted his own television series, For Members Only (broadcast on Associated Television), on which he interspersed interviews with newsworthy people with singing and playing the guitar.Lloyd Bradley, Sounds Like London: 100 Years of Black Music in the Capital, Profile Books, 2013, p. 55. In 1956, Grant appeared alongside Nadia Cattouse, Errol John and Earl Cameron in the BBC TV drama Man From The Sun, whose characters are mostly Caribbean migrants to London,\\"Man From The Sun, A (1956)\\", BFI Screenonline. and also starred in the World War II film Sea Wife (1957), with Richard Burton and Joan Collins. The following year, Grant was asked to feature in the BBC's daily topical programme, Tonight, to \\"sing\\" the news in the form of a \\"topical Calypso\\" (a pun on \\"tropical\\"). With journalist Bernard Levin providing words, Grant strung them together. Tonight was popular and made Grant a well-known public figure, the first black person to appear regularly on British television. However, not wanting to become typecast, he stepped down from this position after two and a half years. His acting career continued apace and later in 1957 he appeared in Home of the Brave, an award-winning TV drama by Arthur Laurents, and travelled the following year to Jamaica for the filming of Calypso, in which he played the romantic lead. In 1964, Grant appeared in the musical The Roar of the Greasepaint ‚Äì The Smell of the Crowd. in which he was the first to perform the song \\"Feeling Good\\", later covered by many others. He included a version of the song on his 1965 album, Cy & I. Grant's general frustration with the lack of good roles for black actors was briefly tempered in 1965 when he played the lead in Othello at the Phoenix Theatre in Leicester, a role for which white actors at the time routinely \\"blacked up\\". Between 1967 and 1968 he also voiced the character of Lieutenant Green in Gerry Anderson's Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. A brief return to the Bar in 1972 reflected Grant's disenchantment with show business as well as his growing politicisation. After six months at a Chambers in the Middle Temple, he decided that he no longer had any passion for law and resolved to challenge discrimination through the arts. Music career Grant performed Caribbean calypso and folk songs in many countries, at venues including Esmeralda's Barn in London (1950s), the New Stanley Hotel, Nairobi (1973), Bricktops, Rome (1956), and for the GTV 9 station in Melbourne, Australia. In addition, he entertained British armed forces in Cyprus, the Maldives, Singapore and Libya. His concert appearances include the Kongresshalle of the Deutsches Museum in Munich (1963) and Queen Elizabeth Hall in London (1971). In 1989, he helped to organise the \\"One Love Africa, Save The Children International Music Festival\\" in Zimbabwe. Grant recorded five LPs. His album Cool Folk (World Record Club, 1964) - featuring \\"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\\", \\"Yellow Bird\\", \\"O Pato\\", \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\", \\"Work Song\\", and \\"Every Night When the Sun Goes Down\\" - is a collector's item. Other LPs include Cy Grant (Transatlantic Records), Cy & I (World Record Club), Ballads, Birds & Blues, (Reality Records) and Cy Grant Sings (Donegall Records). Two of Grant's singles, \\"King Cricket\\" and \\"The Constantine Calypso\\", recorded in 1966 for Pye Records, celebrate the lives of West Indian cricketers Garfield Sobers and Learie Constantine.Music at cygrant.com. The songs were featured in the 2009 BBC Two television documentary series Empire of Cricket. Grant had extensive involvement in British radio broadcasting. The BBC Sound Archive contains more than 90 entries for his radio work, dating from 1954 to 1997. These include a series of six meditations based on 24 of the 81 chapters of the Tao te Ching for the BBC World Service in 1980, The Way of the Tao (Grant was a devotee of Taoism);Angela Cobbinah, \\"Archive launched in recognition of black activist Cy Grant\\" , Camden Review, 18 August 2016. The Calypso Chronicles, six programmes for BBC Radio 2 (1994); Panning for Gold, two programmes for Radio 2; Amazing Grace, Radio 2; and Day Light Come and Wild Blue, both for BBC Radio 4. Grant discussed his experiences of being among the first generation of Afro- Caribbean actors in Britain in TV's Black Pioneers, broadcast on BBC Four in June 2007, and Black Screen Britain, Part 1: Ambassadors for the Race, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2009. Activism In collaboration with Zimbabwean John Mapondera, in 1974 Grant set up the Drum Arts Centre in London (not to be confused with The Drum in Birmingham) to provide a springboard and a national centre for black artistic talent.Colin Chambers, \\"Black British Plays Post World War II -1970s\\", Black Plays Archive, National Theatre. Laurence Olivier rebuffed Grant's invitation to become a patron of Drum, accusing him of being separatist.Angela Cobbinah, \\"Feature: Obituary - Death of cultural activist and 1960s calypso singer Cy Grant\\" , Islington Tribune, 18 February 2010. As recalled by Gus John, a Drum trustee (other trustees included Tania Rose, Chris Konyils, Helen McEachrane, Gurmukh Singh, Eric Smellie and Margaret Busby), Grant said of the prevailing mainstream climate at the time: \\"These people are simply incapable of seeing the world through our lenses, incapable of imagining for just one moment what it must be like for us to experience their system which to us is anything but as open as they would have us believe. They therefore see our self-organisation as an affront.\\" Considered a landmark in the development of black theatre,Professor Gus John and Dr Samina Zahir, Speaking Truth to Power: a Diversity of Voices in Theatre and the Arts in England , Arts Council England, July 2008, pp. 23‚Äì24. Drum counted among its highlights a series of workshops held in 1975 at Morley College by Steve Carter of the New York Negro Ensemble Company. This led to a production of Mustapha Matura's Bread at the Young Vic and workshops with the Royal National Theatre. In 1977, Ola Rotimi produced a Nigerian adaptation of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, titled The Gods Are Not To Blame, at the Greenwich Theatre and Jackson's Lane Community Centre; meanwhile, The Swamp Dwellers by Wole Soyinka was produced at the Commonwealth Institute Theatre. The Drum Arts Centre also premiered Sweet Talk by Michael Abbensetts at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in 1975. Among the exhibitions it mounted was Behind the Mask: Afro-Caribbean Poets and Playwrights in Words and Pictures at the Commonwealth Institute and the National Theatre in 1979. Grant stood down as chair of the Drum Arts Centre in 1978 following internal disagreements, giving him the opportunity to concentrate on a one-man show adapted from Aim√© C√©saire's epic poem Cahier d'un retour au pays natal (Notebook of a Return to My Native Land).\\"Return to my Native Land\\", the Cy Grant Website. A critique of European colonialism and values, it was cited by Grant as a major influence on his thought. After a platform performance at the National Theatre and a two-week production at the Theatre Upstairs, Royal Court Theatre,\\"Return To My Native Land\\", at Black Plays Archive, National Theatre. Grant embarked on a two-year national tour in 1977. In 1981, Grant became director of Concord Multicultural Festivals, which in the course of the four years staged 22 multicultural festivals in cities in England and Wales, starting in Nottingham. These were followed by two national festivals in Devon (1986) and Gloucestershire (1987). Both lasted several months and involved a vast range of local, national and international artistes, as well as workshops, in an attempt to celebrate the cultural diversity of modern-day Britain and foster improved race relations. In 2007, Grant helped open the London, Sugar and Slavery permanent exhibition hosted at the Museum of London Docklands.Kurt Barling, \\"London, sugar and slavery\\", Abolition, BBC, London, 24 September 2014.

It is the collaboration of Grant and Hans Klootwijk, author of Lancaster W4827: Failed to Return, which recounts the fate of Grant and his fellow airmen after their plane was shot down over the Netherlands in 1943. The book is based on research carried out by Klootwijk's father, Joost Klootwijk, who was 11 when the bomber crashed into a farmhouse in his village. With regular updates by surviving aircrew and relatives, as well as by military historians, the online archive has established that West Indians who served as aircrew in the RAF numbered roughly 440 and that at least 70 were commissioned and 103 decorated.

Located at an altitude of 2,080 metres, Aguelmame Sidi Ali has a surface area of approximately and a depth of . It is near the boundary of the province of Ifrane within the Middle Atlas mountains. It is part of Khenifra National Park, a protected area created in 2008. Description The lake is located in the Middle Atlas mountains at an altitude of and has a catchment area of about . It was formed in the Upper Miocene/Quaternary at the intersection of two faults. It is located in a natural hollow in the basalt rock and is formed from two basins, separated by a basal ridge which is exposed when the water level falls. It is fed by runoff, snowmelt and karst springs. The pH is 9.1 and the mineral content is relatively low with a conductivity of 1200‚Äì1600 uScm-1. Ecology The area surrounding the lake was once well-forested with Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica), but more recently, this forest has become degraded and the area around the lake has become dry, thorny scrubland dominated by Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera). The plankton and sediment in the lake is rich in diatoms, particularly of the genus Cyclotella, and these have been used to provide evidence of the paleohydrology and related hydroclimatic changes the lake has undergone over the aeons. In 2005, the Aguelmams Sidi Ali / Tifounassine complex, three mountain wetlands at altitudes between , have been designated as a Ramsar site; they provide important over-wintering sites for migratory wetland birds including the ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) and the crested coot (Fulica cristata). A decreasing trend in precipitation has lowered the water level of the lake, and a marsh that used to be at the southwest end no longer exists. The grazing of flocks of sheep and goats by nomadic herdsmen in the spring and summer has all but eliminated the aquatic vegetation at the edge of the lake. A reduced number of water birds visit the lake in winter and the great crested grebe no longer breeds here. Despite being protected, the ruddy shelduck and other wildfowl suffer from poaching. The lake used to be the only place in the world where Salmo pallaryi, a native species of trout, lived but that fish became extinct after the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) was released into the lake in 1934. The northern pike (Esox lucius) and the zander (Sander lucioperca), are other non-native fish species now present in the lake.

It was signed February 22, 2007. The document expounded on the sacrament of the Eucharist. Following an introduction, it consisted of three parts, each presenting a different perspective of the Church's understanding of the Eucharist. Content Pope Benedict examines the important relationship between the Eucharist and the other sacraments. He also highlights the social implications of the Eucharist and connects it with the Church's social teaching.Sacrament of Charity, USCCB The document is divided in three parts revolving around the Eucharist as a mystery (1) to be believed, (2) to be celebrated, and (3) to be lived. ;To be believed In Sacramentum caritatis, Benedict quotes John 6:51, \\"\\"I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh\\".Pope Benedict XVI, Sacramentum caritatis, ¬ß7, February 22, 2007, Libreria Editrice Vaticana He points out that the Eucharist is essentially Trinitarian. \\"Saint Cyril of Jerusalem, in his Catecheses, states that we \\"call upon God in his mercy to send his Holy Spirit upon the offerings before us, to transform the bread into the body of Christ and the wine into the blood of Christ.\\" The epiclesis of the Mass is a petition to the Father to send down the gift of the Spirit so that the bread and the wine will become the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Benedict also expands on the relationship between the Eucharist and the Sacrament of Penance. \\"We know that the faithful are surrounded by a culture that tends to eliminate the sense of sin and to promote a superficial approach that overlooks the need to be in a state of grace in order to approach sacramental communion worthily. The loss of a consciousness of sin always entails a certain superficiality in the understanding of God's love. Bringing out the elements within the rite of Mass that express consciousness of personal sin and, at the same time, of God's mercy, can prove most helpful to the faithful.\\" Since the beauty of the Eucharist pertains directly to Christ in his person, it enables the participants a glimpse into the eschatological dimension inherent in the Eucharist as a pledge of future glory. ;To be celebrated In the celebration of the Eucharist, Jesus Christ shows us how the truth of love can transform even the dark mystery of death into the radiant light of the resurrection. Through the Eucharist, He becomes all in all, present in his totality within the members of the Church (par #36). The individual members make up the spiritual stones of the Church.

He is professor at the Racah Institute of Physics of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is known for his solar and cosmic-ray hypothesis of climate change. In 2002, Shaviv hypothesised that passages through the Milky Way's spiral arms appear to have been the cause behind the major ice- ages over the past billion years. In his later work, co-authored by Jan Veizer, a low upper limit was placed on the climatic effect of . His best known contribution to the field of astrophysics was to demonstrate that the Eddington luminosity is not a strict limit, namely, that astrophysical objects can be brighter than the Eddington luminosity without blowing themselves apart. This is achieved through the development of a porous atmosphere that allows the radiation to escape while exerting little force on the gas. The theory was correctly used to explain the mass-loss in Eta Carinae's giant eruption, and the evolution of classical nova eruptions. Education and career Shaviv started taking courses at the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa at age 13. After a 3 year service in the IDF Unit 8200, he received in 1994 a Master of Science in physics and a doctorate during 1994‚Äì96. During 1996‚Äì99, he was a Lee DuBridge Prize Fellow at Caltech's TAPIR (Theoretical Astrophysics) group. During 1999‚Äì2001, he was in a postdoctorate position at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics. In 2001‚Äì2006, he was a senior lecturer at Racah Institute of physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 2006‚Äì2012, he was an associate professor, and full professor since 2012. Between 2008 and 2011, he was the head of the faculty union of the Hebrew University, and he served as the chairman of coordinating council of faculty unions between 2010 and 2014. In 2014, he became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and served as the chairman of The Racah Institute of Physics between 2015 and 2019. Scientific research=Eddington luminosity limit In 1999, Shaviv has shown that inhomogeneities in stellar atmospheres reduce the effective opacity and thus increase the Eddington luminosity. Shaviv later showed that atmospheres are inherently unstable as the Eddington luminosity is approached, that these atmospheres will develop continuum driven winds that explain the appearance of eta-Carinae and classical nova eruptions. In 2010, Shaviv made the prediction that Type IIn supernova should have super-Eddington outbursts before the main supernova explosions since the super-Eddington states can naturally explain the circum-stellar material present around the supernova at the time of explosion (Giving the narrow lines observed in the spectrum, i.e., the ‚Äún‚Äù in the Type IIn). Such precursors were later detected with the Palomar Transient Factory, making them the first systematically detected supernova precursors. Cosmic rays and climate Shaviv has been one of the proponents of a cosmic ray climate link. In 2003 he has shown that the cosmic ray flux over the past billion years can be reconstructed from the exposure ages of Iron meteorites, that these flux variations are expected from spiral arm passages, and they correlate with the appearance of ice age epochs on Earth. In a later work with J√°n Veizer, it was demonstrated that the temperature reconstruction over the Phanerozoic correlates with the cosmic ray flux, but it does not correlate with the CO2 reconstruction, thus placing an upper limit on the effects of CO2. This prompted several reactions by the climate community and rebuttals by Shaviv and his colleagues. He has also shown that the cosmic ray climate link explains part the faint sun paradox, since the slowly decreasing solar wind will give rise to a cooling effect that compensates the solar irradiance increase. Moreover, long term star formation activity in the Milky Way correlate with long term climate variations. In a more recent work with Andreas Prokoph and J√°n Veizer, it was argued that the reconstructed temperature has a clear 32 million year oscillation that is consistent with the solar system's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane. The oscillation also appears to have a secondary modulation consistent with the radial epicyclic motion of the solar system. Solar variation and climate sensitivity Because the existence of a significant cosmic ray climate link implies that solar variability will also have a large effect on the climate, Shaviv advocated the idea that natural climate variations play a significant role in 20th century climate change. Moreover, if solar activity increase over the 20th century contributed to warming in addition to the anthropogenic forcing, then the overall climate sensitivity should be lower than advocated by standard scenarios which do not include solar forcing. In 2008, Shaviv used the oceans as a giant calorimeter to quantify the solar radiative forcing. He found that the peak to peak variations are close to 1 W/m2, significantly more than can be expected from the changes in the solar irradiance. In 2011, he published a paper with Shlomi Ziskin arguing that the solar variability explains about half the 20th century warming, with the other half attributable to anthropogenic forcing. Shaviv's solar hypothesis has been disputed by Mike Lockwood and Claus Froehlich in an analysis of the sun's output over the last 25 years. They argue that the sun's activity has been decreasing since 1985 while global temperatures have continued to rise. Shaviv argues that Lockwood and Froehlich's analysis is flawed for a number of reasons. Firstly, while sunspot activity declined after 1985, cosmic ray flux reached a minimum in 1992 and contributed to warming during the 1990s. Secondly, Shaviv argues that short term variations in radiative forcing are damped by the oceans, leading to a lag between changes in solar output and the effect on global temperatures. While the 2001 maximum was weaker than the 1990 maximum, increasing solar activity during previous decades was still having a warming effect, not unlike the lag between noon and the hottest hour of the day. Later quantitative modeling showed that indeed there is no discrepancy. The perceived \\"hiatus\\" in the early 2000s is a natural consequence of the decreased solar activity. Rejection of human-caused climate change Shaviv disagrees with the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change.Nir Shaviv Desmogblog. Retrieved 12/07/2018. He claims that solar activity changes have contributed between half to two thirds of the warming over the 20th century, and that climate sensitivity should be on the low side ŒîTx2=1.3¬±0.4 ¬∞C compared with IPCC's range of ŒîTx2=1.5 to 4.5 ¬∞C per CO2 doubling. Shaviv was interviewed for The Great Global Warming Swindle documentary. In the film he states: In 2012, he contributed, along with Werner Weber, Henrik Svensmark and Nicola Scafetta, to the book Die kalte Sonne. Warum die Klimakatastrophe nicht stattfindet (The Cold Sun) of Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian L√ºning, a book expressing climate change denial, which attracted considerable interest in Germany.Fritz Vahrenholt, Sebastian L√ºning: Die kalte Sonne.

Plot Katie Connors (Jane Greer), on the editorial staff of Sight magazine, journeys to San Marcos, a remote Mexican fishing village, seeking novelist and adventurer Mike Latimer (Richard Widmark), who has abandoned writing \\"at the peak of his fame\\" and dropped from sight. She soon learns that he is indeed there, indulging in drinking, fishing, hunting, and flying his aircraft. Katie contrives to meet him, pretending not to know his identity, but Latimer easily sees through her clumsy denials and is immediately attracted to her. Over the next several days they enjoy each other's company, but Katie may be falling in love with him and conceals the real reason she is there. After Latimer explains that his wife was the muse behind his literary success, and that he quit writing because she left him to be with his best friend, Katie decides to go back to New York. Latimer offers to fly her to Mexico City and asks Katie to write down her address to keep in touch. During the flight, the magnetized notebook in Katie's purse affects the aircraft's magnetic compass and they find themselves lost over jungle. The aircraft runs out of fuel and Latimer crash-lands in a small clearing. Knocked unconscious, he wakes up to find himself in a bed in the main house of a hacienda. Katie introduces him to their rescuers, an Englishman named Browne (Trevor Howard) and the Dutch archaeologist Dr. van Anders (Peter van Eyck), who live on the estate with Jan (Carlos Henning) a third European. Latimer feels that he once met the cordial Browne, a big game hunter himself, but cannot place it. The more suspicious and secretive Anders asks about a rifle bullet that Latimer always carries with him, which Latimer relates is a souvenir and good luck charm from the D-Day invasion, a time when his courage failed him. Almost immediately the couple senses that things are not as they appear. Browne keeps a pack of savage dogs to prowl the estate and control the local populace; when Latimer goes to examine the condition of his aircraft, it has disappeared; Browne claims he has no contact to the outside world and Katie doubts that Anders is really an archaeologist. However friction develops between them when a newscast on the radio announcing their disappearance reveals Katie's identity and original purpose. Katie tries to persuade Latimer that she no longer intends to write the story but he rebuffs her. That night, Latimer finds a storeroom containing military gear with Nazi markings, items from his missing aircraft supposedly stolen by the local Indians, and a cabinet of hunting rifles. The barking of the prowling dogs awakens Browne and Anders, and Latimer overhears them talking in German. He tells Katie what he found and warns her that they need to work together to try to escape. They discover that Browne has been concealing from them, his own \\"flyable\\" aircraft. Latimer finally realizes it is Browne's voice he recognizes, and that he is an infamous turncoat who during the war broadcast Nazi propaganda from Berlin to Britain after he had married a German girl. The Englishman admits the truth and adds that his wife was Anders' sister, killed in a British air raid. Latimer tries to bargain for Katie's release but to no avail. Latimer realizes Anders is a German war criminal who massacred an entire village and intends to kill them. He and Katie try to steal the aircraft, but when Jan shoots at them, they flee into the jungle. Browne, leading Anders, Jan and the dogs, follows their trail, failing to catch them the first day when a group of wild pigs attack the dogs. The next day, the wilderness-wise Latimer rigs a crude booby trap that kills Jan. With Katie nearing exhaustion, Latimer contrives to double back, and when Browne and Anders find Jan's dead body, they realize that the aircraft has been left unguarded. Stopping for the night, Latimer starts to cover Katie with his jacket and finds that she wrote down the office address of Sight magazine as her own, proving that she had been truthful about her feelings. They reach the hacienda just ahead of their pursuers and barricade themselves in the chapel. Anders pretends to negotiate with Latimer and shoots through the door. Latimer ridicules him and when Anders goes to bring workers to break down the door, he is forced to lock up the dogs to get their cooperation. Browne fears the fanatical Nazi and offers to shoot Anders if Latimer flies him to South America. Latimer refuses and uses the bullet hole in the door as a makeshift gun barrel for his lucky bullet, striking the primer with a chisel and fatally shooting Browne. Latimer and Katie take off in Browne's aircraft, killing Anders with the propeller when he tries to block their path. They manage to safely escape.

The jungle sequences in Run for the Sun were shot about 50 miles from Acapulco, Mexico. The location used for Browne and Van Anders' base was a vast, ruined, 16th century hacienda and sugar plantation/refinery built by Hern√°n Cort√©s at Atlacomulco, southeast of Cuernavaca. In the 1980s, the principal house and several other buildings were restored and turned into a hotel. The interior and patio of the house used in the film, as well as the interior of the small hotel where Katie Connors and Mike Latimer meet, were sets built at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City. The house interior was reputed to be the largest set yet built in a Mexican studio.

P. (2012). Machine learning: a probabilistic perspective, p. 35\\\\. MIT press. .) is a discrete probability distribution that describes the possible results of a random variable that can take on one of K possible categories, with the probability of each category separately specified. There is no innate underlying ordering of these outcomes, but numerical labels are often attached for convenience in describing the distribution, (e.g. 1 to K). The K-dimensional categorical distribution is the most general distribution over a K-way event; any other discrete distribution over a size-K sample space is a special case. The parameters specifying the probabilities of each possible outcome are constrained only by the fact that each must be in the range 0 to 1, and all must sum to 1. The categorical distribution is the generalization of the Bernoulli distribution for a categorical random variable, i.e. for a discrete variable with more than two possible outcomes, such as the roll of a die. On the other hand, the categorical distribution is a special case of the multinomial distribution, in that it gives the probabilities of potential outcomes of a single drawing rather than multiple drawings.  Terminology  Occasionally, the categorical distribution is termed the \\"discrete distribution\\". However, this properly refers not to one particular family of distributions but to a general class of distributions. In some fields, such as machine learning and natural language processing, the categorical and multinomial distributions are conflated, and it is common to speak of a \\"multinomial distribution\\" when a \\"categorical distribution\\" would be more precise.Minka, T. (2003) Bayesian inference, entropy and the multinomial distribution. Technical report Microsoft Research. This imprecise usage stems from the fact that it is sometimes convenient to express the outcome of a categorical distribution as a \\"1-of-K\\" vector (a vector with one element containing a 1 and all other elements containing a 0) rather than as an integer in the range 1 to K; in this form, a categorical distribution is equivalent to a multinomial distribution for a single observation (see below). However, conflating the categorical and multinomial distributions can lead to problems. For example, in a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution, which arises commonly in natural language processing models (although not usually with this name) as a result of collapsed Gibbs sampling where Dirichlet distributions are collapsed out of a hierarchical Bayesian model, it is very important to distinguish categorical from multinomial. The joint distribution of the same variables with the same Dirichlet-multinomial distribution has two different forms depending on whether it is characterized as a distribution whose domain is over individual categorical nodes or over multinomial-style counts of nodes in each particular category (similar to the distinction between a set of Bernoulli-distributed nodes and a single binomial-distributed node). Both forms have very similar-looking probability mass functions (PMFs), which both make reference to multinomial-style counts of nodes in a category. However, the multinomial-style PMF has an extra factor, a multinomial coefficient, that is a constant equal to 1 in the categorical-style PMF. Confusing the two can easily lead to incorrect results in settings where this extra factor is not constant with respect to the distributions of interest. The factor is frequently constant in the complete conditionals used in Gibbs sampling and the optimal distributions in variational methods.  Formulating distributions  A categorical distribution is a discrete probability distribution whose sample space is the set of k individually identified items. It is the generalization of the Bernoulli distribution for a categorical random variable. In one formulation of the distribution, the sample space is taken to be a finite sequence of integers. The exact integers used as labels are unimportant; they might be {0, 1, ..., k ‚àí 1} or {1, 2, ..., k} or any other arbitrary set of values. In the following descriptions, we use {1, 2, ..., k} for convenience, although this disagrees with the convention for the Bernoulli distribution, which uses {0, 1}. In this case, the probability mass function f is: : f(x=i\\\\mid \\\\boldsymbol{p} ) = p_i , where \\\\boldsymbol{p} = (p_1,\\\\ldots,p_k), p_i represents the probability of seeing element i and \\\\textstyle{\\\\sum_{i=1}^k p_i = 1}. Another formulation that appears more complex but facilitates mathematical manipulations is as follows, using the Iverson bracket:Minka, T. (2003), op. cit. Minka uses the Kronecker delta function, similar to but less general than the Iverson bracket. : f(x\\\\mid \\\\boldsymbol{p} ) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{[x=i]} , where [x=i] evaluates to 1 if x=i, 0 otherwise. There are various advantages of this formulation, e.g.: * It is easier to write out the likelihood function of a set of independent identically distributed categorical variables. * It connects the categorical distribution with the related multinomial distribution. * It shows why the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution, and allows the posterior distribution of the parameters to be calculated. Yet another formulation makes explicit the connection between the categorical and multinomial distributions by treating the categorical distribution as a special case of the multinomial distribution in which the parameter n of the multinomial distribution (the number of sampled items) is fixed at 1. In this formulation, the sample space can be considered to be the set of 1-of-K encoded random vectors x of dimension k having the property that exactly one element has the value 1 and the others have the value 0. The particular element having the value 1 indicates which category has been chosen. The probability mass function f in this formulation is: : f( \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\mid \\\\boldsymbol{p} ) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{x_i} , where p_i represents the probability of seeing element i and \\\\textstyle{\\\\sum_i p_i = 1}. This is the formulation adopted by Bishop.Bishop, C. (2006) Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Springer. .  Properties  The possible probabilities for the categorical distribution with k = 3 are the 2-simplex p_1+p_2+p_3 = 1, embedded in 3-space. * The distribution is completely given by the probabilities associated with each number i: p_i = P(X = i), i = 1,...,k, where \\\\textstyle{\\\\sum_i p_i = 1}. The possible sets of probabilities are exactly those in the standard (k-1)-dimensional simplex; for k = 2 this reduces to the possible probabilities of the Bernoulli distribution being the 1-simplex, p_1+p_2=1, 0 \\\\leq p_1,p_2 \\\\leq 1 . * The distribution is a special case of a \\"multivariate Bernoulli distribution\\"Johnson, N.L., Kotz, S., Balakrishnan, N. (1997) Discrete Multivariate Distributions, Wiley. (p. 105) in which exactly one of the k 0-1 variables takes the value one. * \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\right] = \\\\boldsymbol{p} * Let \\\\boldsymbol{X} be the realisation from a categorical distribution. Define the random vector Y as composed of the elements: :: Y_i=I(\\\\boldsymbol{X}=i), : where I is the indicator function. Then Y has a distribution which is a special case of the multinomial distribution with parameter n=1. The sum of n independent and identically distributed such random variables Y constructed from a categorical distribution with parameter \\\\boldsymbol{p} is multinomially distributed with parameters n and \\\\boldsymbol{p} . * The conjugate prior distribution of a categorical distribution is a Dirichlet distribution. See the section below for more discussion. * The sufficient statistic from n independent observations is the set of counts (or, equivalently, proportion) of observations in each category, where the total number of trials (=n) is fixed. * The indicator function of an observation having a value i, equivalent to the Iverson bracket function [x=i] or the Kronecker delta function \\\\delta_{xi}, is Bernoulli distributed with parameter p_i .  Bayesian inference using conjugate prior  In Bayesian statistics, the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior distribution of the categorical distribution (and also the multinomial distribution). This means that in a model consisting of a data point having a categorical distribution with unknown parameter vector p, and (in standard Bayesian style) we choose to treat this parameter as a random variable and give it a prior distribution defined using a Dirichlet distribution, then the posterior distribution of the parameter, after incorporating the knowledge gained from the observed data, is also a Dirichlet. Intuitively, in such a case, starting from what is known about the parameter prior to observing the data point, knowledge can then be updated based on the data point, yielding a new distribution of the same form as the old one. As such, knowledge of a parameter can be successively updated by incorporating new observations one at a time, without running into mathematical difficulties. Formally, this can be expressed as follows. Given a model : \\\\begin{array}{lclcl} \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha &=& (\\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_K) &=& \\\\text{concentration hyperparameter} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{p}\\\\mid\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha &=& (p_1, \\\\ldots, p_K) &\\\\sim& \\\\operatorname{Dir}(K, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha) \\\\ \\\\mathbb{X}\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{p} &=& (x_1, \\\\ldots, x_K) &\\\\sim& \\\\operatorname{Cat}(K,\\\\mathbf{p}) \\\\end{array} then the following holds: : \\\\begin{array}{lclcl} \\\\mathbf{c} &=& (c_1, \\\\ldots, c_K) &=& \\\\text{number of occurrences of category }i = \\\\sum_{j=1}^N [x_j=i] \\\\ \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\mid \\\\mathbb{X},\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha &\\\\sim& \\\\operatorname{Dir}(K,\\\\mathbf{c}+\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha) &=& \\\\operatorname{Dir}(K,c_1+\\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,c_K+\\\\alpha_K) \\\\end{array} This relationship is used in Bayesian statistics to estimate the underlying parameter p of a categorical distribution given a collection of N samples. Intuitively, we can view the hyperprior vector Œ± as pseudocounts, i.e. as representing the number of observations in each category that we have already seen. Then we simply add in the counts for all the new observations (the vector c) in order to derive the posterior distribution. Further intuition comes from the expected value of the posterior distribution (see the article on the Dirichlet distribution): : \\\\operatorname{E}[p_i \\\\mid \\\\mathbb{X},\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha] = \\\\frac{c_i+\\\\alpha_i}{N+\\\\sum_k\\\\alpha_k} This says that the expected probability of seeing a category i among the various discrete distributions generated by the posterior distribution is simply equal to the proportion of occurrences of that category actually seen in the data, including the pseudocounts in the prior distribution. This makes a great deal of intuitive sense: if, for example, there are three possible categories, and category 1 is seen in the observed data 40% of the time, one would expect on average to see category 1 40% of the time in the posterior distribution as well. (This intuition is ignoring the effect of the prior distribution. Furthermore, the posterior is a distribution over distributions. The posterior distribution in general describes the parameter in question, and in this case the parameter itself is a discrete probability distribution, i.e. the actual categorical distribution that generated the data. For example, if 3 categories in the ratio 40:5:55 are in the observed data, then ignoring the effect of the prior distribution, the true parameter ‚Äì i.e. the true, underlying distribution that generated our observed data ‚Äì would be expected to have the average value of (0.40,0.05,0.55), which is indeed what the posterior reveals. However, the true distribution might actually be (0.35,0.07,0.58) or (0.42,0.04,0.54) or various other nearby possibilities. The amount of uncertainty involved here is specified by the variance of the posterior, which is controlled by the total number of observations ‚Äì the more data observed, the less uncertainty about the true parameter.) (Technically, the prior parameter \\\\alpha_i should actually be seen as representing \\\\alpha_i-1 prior observations of category i. Then, the updated posterior parameter c_i+\\\\alpha_i represents c_i+\\\\alpha_i-1 posterior observations. This reflects the fact that a Dirichlet distribution with \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha = (1,1,\\\\ldots) has a completely flat shape ‚Äî essentially, a uniform distribution over the simplex of possible values of p. Logically, a flat distribution of this sort represents total ignorance, corresponding to no observations of any sort. However, the mathematical updating of the posterior works fine if we ignore the \\\\cdots-1 term and simply think of the Œ± vector as directly representing a set of pseudocounts. Furthermore, doing this avoids the issue of interpreting \\\\alpha_i values less than 1.)  MAP estimation  The maximum-a-posteriori estimate of the parameter p in the above model is simply the mode of the posterior Dirichlet distribution, i.e., : \\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,max}\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbf{p}} p(\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\mid \\\\mathbb{X}) = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_i + c_i - 1}{\\\\sum_i (\\\\alpha_i + c_i - 1)}, \\\\qquad \\\\forall i \\\\; \\\\alpha_i + c_i > 1 In many practical applications, the only way to guarantee the condition that \\\\forall i \\\\; \\\\alpha_i + c_i > 1 is to set \\\\alpha_i > 1 for all i. Marginal likelihood In the above model, the marginal likelihood of the observations (i.e. the joint distribution of the observations, with the prior parameter marginalized out) is a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution: : \\\\begin{align} p(\\\\mathbb{X}\\\\mid\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}) &= \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{p}}p(\\\\mathbb{X}\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{p})p(\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\mid\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha})\\\\textrm{d}\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\ &= \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\sum_k \\\\alpha_k\\\\right)} {\\\\Gamma\\\\left(N+\\\\sum_k \\\\alpha_k\\\\right)}\\\\prod_{k=1}^K\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(c_{k}+\\\\alpha_{k})}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_{k})} \\\\end{align} This distribution plays an important role in hierarchical Bayesian models, because when doing inference over such models using methods such as Gibbs sampling or variational Bayes, Dirichlet prior distributions are often marginalized out. See the article on this distribution for more details.  Posterior predictive distribution  The posterior predictive distribution of a new observation in the above model is the distribution that a new observation \\\\tilde{x} would take given the set \\\\mathbb{X} of N categorical observations. As shown in the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution article, it has a very simple form: : \\\\begin{align} p(\\\\tilde{x}=i\\\\mid\\\\mathbb{X},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}) &= \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{p}}p(\\\\tilde{x}=i\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{p})\\\\,p(\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\mid\\\\mathbb{X},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha})\\\\,\\\\textrm{d}\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\ &=\\\\, \\\\frac{c_i + \\\\alpha_i}{N+\\\\sum_k \\\\alpha_k} \\\\ &=\\\\, \\\\mathbb{E}[p_i \\\\mid \\\\mathbb{X},\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha] \\\\ &\\\\propto\\\\, c_i + \\\\alpha_i. \\\\ \\\\end{align} There are various relationships among this formula and the previous ones: * The posterior predictive probability of seeing a particular category is the same as the relative proportion of previous observations in that category (including the pseudo-observations of the prior). This makes logical sense ‚Äî intuitively, we would expect to see a particular category according to the frequency already observed of that category. * The posterior predictive probability is the same as the expected value of the posterior distribution. This is explained more below. * As a result, this formula can be expressed as simply \\"the posterior predictive probability of seeing a category is proportional to the total observed count of that category\\", or as \\"the expected count of a category is the same as the total observed count of the category\\", where \\"observed count\\" is taken to include the pseudo-observations of the prior. The reason for the equivalence between posterior predictive probability and the expected value of the posterior distribution of p is evident with re-examination of the above formula. As explained in the posterior predictive distribution article, the formula for the posterior predictive probability has the form of an expected value taken with respect to the posterior distribution: : \\\\begin{align} p(\\\\tilde{x}=i\\\\mid\\\\mathbb{X},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}) &= \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{p}}p(\\\\tilde{x}=i\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{p})\\\\,p(\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\mid\\\\mathbb{X},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha})\\\\,\\\\textrm{d}\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\ &=\\\\, \\\\operatorname{E}_{\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\mid\\\\mathbb{X},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}} \\\\left[p(\\\\tilde{x}=i\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{p})\\\\right] \\\\ &=\\\\, \\\\operatorname{E}_{\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\mid\\\\mathbb{X},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}} \\\\left[p_i\\\\right] \\\\ &=\\\\, \\\\operatorname{E}[p_i \\\\mid \\\\mathbb{X},\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha]. \\\\end{align} The crucial line above is the third. The second follows directly from the definition of expected value. The third line is particular to the categorical distribution, and follows from the fact that, in the categorical distribution specifically, the expected value of seeing a particular value i is directly specified by the associated parameter pi. The fourth line is simply a rewriting of the third in a different notation, using the notation farther up for an expectation taken with respect to the posterior distribution of the parameters. Observe data points one by one and each time consider their predictive probability before observing the data point and updating the posterior. For any given data point, the probability of that point assuming a given category depends on the number of data points already in that category. In this scenario, if a category has a high frequency of occurrence, then new data points are more likely to join that category ‚Äî further enriching the same category. This type of scenario is often termed a preferential attachment (or \\"rich get richer\\") model. This models many real-world processes, and in such cases the choices made by the first few data points have an outsize influence on the rest of the data points.  Posterior conditional distribution  In Gibbs sampling, one typically needs to draw from conditional distributions in multi-variable Bayes networks where each variable is conditioned on all the others. In networks that include categorical variables with Dirichlet priors (e.g. mixture models and models including mixture components), the Dirichlet distributions are often \\"collapsed out\\" (marginalized out) of the network, which introduces dependencies among the various categorical nodes dependent on a given prior (specifically, their joint distribution is a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution). One of the reasons for doing this is that in such a case, the distribution of one categorical node given the others is exactly the posterior predictive distribution of the remaining nodes. That is, for a set of nodes \\\\mathbb{X}, if the node in question is denoted as x_n and the remainder as \\\\mathbb{X}^{(-n)}, then : \\\\begin{align} p(x_n=i\\\\mid\\\\mathbb{X}^{(-n)},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}) &=\\\\, \\\\frac{c_i^{(-n)} + \\\\alpha_i}{N-1+\\\\sum_i \\\\alpha_i} &\\\\propto\\\\, c_i^{(-n)} + \\\\alpha_i \\\\end{align} where c_i^{(-n)} is the number of nodes having category i among the nodes other than node n.  Sampling  There are a number of methods, but the most common way to sample from a categorical distribution uses a type of inverse transform sampling: Assume a distribution is expressed as \\"proportional to\\" some expression, with unknown normalizing constant. Before taking any samples, one prepares some values as follows: #Compute the unnormalized value of the distribution for each category. #Sum them up and divide each value by this sum, in order to normalize them. #Impose some sort of order on the categories (e.g. by an index that runs from 1 to k, where k is the number of categories). #Convert the values to a cumulative distribution function (CDF) by replacing each value with the sum of all of the previous values. This can be done in time O(k). The resulting value for the first category will be 0. Then, each time it is necessary to sample a value: # Pick a uniformly distributed number between 0 and 1. # Locate the greatest number in the CDF whose value is less than or equal to the number just chosen. This can be done in time O(log(k)), by binary search. # Return the category corresponding to this CDF value. If it is necessary to draw many values from the same categorical distribution, the following approach is more efficient. It draws n samples in O(n) time (assuming an O(1) approximation is used to draw values from the binomial distributionAgresti, A., An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis, Wiley- Interscience, 2007, , pp. 25). function draw_categorical(n) // where n is the number of samples to draw from the categorical distribution r = 1 s = 0 for i from 1 to k // where k is the number of categories v = draw from a binomial(n, p[i] / r) distribution // where p[i] is the probability of category i for j from 1 to v z[s++] = i // where z is an array in which the results are stored n = n - v r = r - p[i] shuffle (randomly re-order) the elements in z return z  Sampling via the Gumbel distribution  In machine learning it is typical to parametrize the categorical distribution, p_1,\\\\ldots,p_k via an unconstrained representation in \\\\mathbb{R}^k, whose components are given by: : \\\\gamma_i = \\\\log p_i + \\\\alpha where \\\\alpha is any real constant. Given this representation, p_1,\\\\ldots,p_k can be recovered using the softmax function, which can then be sampled using the techniques described above. There is however a more direct sampling method that uses samples from the Gumbel distribution. Let g_1,\\\\ldots,g_k be k independent draws from the standard Gumbel distribution, then : c = \\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,max}\\\\limits_i \\\\gamma_i + g_i will be a sample from the desired categorical distribution. (If u_i is a sample from the standard uniform distribution, then g_i=-\\\\log(-\\\\log u_i) is a sample from the standard Gumbel distribution.)

This uniform law originated by the parents of internationally abducted children, and parents fearing their children would be abducted. The act provides States with a valuable tool for deterring both domestic and international child abductions by parents and any persons acting on behalf of the parents. Recognizing that most States have already developed substantial bodies of law regarding child custody determinations and enforcement, including specifically the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), the NCCUSL drafted UCAPA to be compatible with and to augment existing state law. Under UCAPA, an action for abduction prevention measures may be brought either by a court on its own motion, by a party to a child- custody determination or an individual with a right to seek such a determination, or by a prosecutor or public attorney. The party seeking the abduction prevention measures must file a petition with the court specifying the risk factors for abduction as well as other biographical information including the name, age and gender of the child, the current address of the child and the person against whom the measures are sought, a statement regarding any prior actions related to abduction or domestic violence, a statement addressing any prior arrests for domestic violence or child abuse by either party, and finally any additional information required by existing State child custody law including the UCCJEA. UCAPA sets out a variety of factors in determining whether there is a credible risk a child will be abducted. If a court determines that a credible risk exists that the child will be abducted, it may then enter an order containing provisions and measures meant to prevent abduction. The act lists a number of specific measures that a court may order. These include imposing travel restrictions, prohibiting the individual from removing the child from the State or other set geographic area, placing the child's name in the United States Department of State's Child Passport Issuance Alert Program, or requiring the individual to obtain an order from a foreign country containing identical terms to the child-custody determination. An abduction prevention order is effective until the earliest of the order's expiration, the child's emancipation, the child's 18th birthday, or until the order is modified, revoked, or vacated. If abduction appears imminent, a court may issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child, direct law enforcement officers to take steps to locate and return the child, or exercise other appropriate powers under existing state laws. A warrant to take physical custody is enforceable in the enacting state even if issued by different state. The court may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property, or even to make a forcible entry at any hour, if the circumstances so warrant. Nevertheless, the person on whom the warrant is being executed must be served with the warrant when or immediately after the child is taken into custody and the person must be afforded a hearing no later than the next judicial day or the next possible judicial day if the next day is impossible. Up to date legislative activity on UCAPA can be found here.  Risk factors  UCAPA sets out a wide variety of factors that should be considered in determining whether there is a credible risk that a child will be abducted. These factors include overt signs such as previous abductions, attempts to abduct the child, or threats of abduction, as well as signs of general abuse including domestic violence, negligence, or refusal to obey a child-custody determination. The act also includes a wide range of activities that may indicate a planned abduction including abandoning employment, liquidating assets, obtaining travel documents or travel tickets, or requesting the child's school or medical records. The act also addresses the special problems involved with international child abduction by including several risk factors specifically related to international abduction. In particular, the act requires courts to consider whether the party in question is likely to take a child to a country that isn't a party to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, or to a country that places the child at risk, has laws that would restrict access to the child, that is on the current list of state sponsors of terrorism, or is engaged in an active military action or war. In addition, a court will consider issues related to citizenship such as a recent change in citizenship status or a denial of United States Citizenship.  States that have adopted UCAPA  The first seven states to hear the UCAPA legislation passed the law with unanimous votes.  Pre-Louisiana Review  Nebraska (2/07), Utah (3/07), Kansas (4/07), South Dakota (07), Nevada (5/07), Colorado (5/07)  Post-Louisiana Review  District of Columbia, Mississippi (09), Alabama (10), Florida, (10), Tennessee (10)  States that adopted UCAPA with significant modifications =Louisiana Louisiana Modifications = Louisiana inserted the word \\"INTERNATIONAL\\" into the state's version of the Child Abduction Prevention Act. Louisiana modified the bill to delete application of the Act between states, with an intent to limit application to non-Hague Convention countries. Louisiana modified the application of the risk factors from being considered singly to requiring that a judge to consider all statutory factors. = Selected Comments from the Louisiana Committee hearings = Excerpt from comments by Representative Bowler Rep. Bowler Excerpt from Harold Murry Family Law Attorney, Alexandria Murry:  States that declined to adopt UCAPA  The UCAPA legislation has failed in most states since the Louisiana review in 2007. Since Louisiana, the UCAPA law has only passed in states that were not informed of the Louisiana and New Jersey reports.  New Jersey (2008)  The New Jersey law commission considered the UCAPA, and issued its final report on this bill in December 2008 but did not recommend its adoption. The New Jersey law commission report has been used in defeating this legislation in other states that are considering the UCAPA legislation. The most significant declination was in New Jersey because they wrote a report detailing why the legislation was unconstitutional. Their New Jersey Law Commission was recommending that the law be presented to their legislature for passage and had placed their recommendation on the internet for public comment. LaDads saw this request and provided them the concerns that they had raised in Louisiana. The New Jersey law commission then issued a report (2008, see link below) highlighting the issues that were raised that they were most concerned with. After a full review, they then issued a final report summarizing the serious issues with this legislation. They declined to recommend this legislation to their legislature. Pennsylvania The Act has been raised several times in Pennsylvania: * HB 1546 was introduced on 6/18/07 and nothing further is reported. * In 2009, HB 90 was passed by the House 193 to 0.

After treating James to the best of his ability, he challenges him as to why he was there and why Obidin was killed. When James protests that their intentions were peaceful, he is shown CCTV footage of the murder. The agent lets James call CHERUB campus before he leaves, telling him not to go to sleep at any cost. Mission controller Ewart Asker arrives and takes James to an airfield where two British service people are to help with their escape. The Russian authorities appear, though, and they are forced to take the couple with them. On the flight, James passes out when air trapped in his broken nose expands due to air pressure changes and the pilot ends up making an emergency landing in Helsinki, Finland. Half a week later, James wakes up in hospital on CHERUB campus to the relief of Lauren and Kerry. However, Ewart and his wife, CHERUB chairwoman Zara Asker, reveal to James that they have been forced to suspend him pending an investigation into the agents' death. Once he is up and about, James is made to choose between helping junior CHERUBs preparing for basic training or a course in socioeconomics. James chooses the PE training, and is asked to help a red shirt, Kevin Sumner, who is scared of heights. Bruce Norris helps, but breaks his ankle falling from the height course. However, while this freaks James out, Kevin gains confidence and soon decides to try the height course alone. He succeeds, and James is rewarded for his work by having his history GCSE pass guaranteed. Meanwhile, Lauren gets her first solo mission, a brutal solo mission about human trafficking and prostitution. Her mission is to befriend Anna, a young Russian girl that is suspected to be a victim of human trafficking. Lauren befriends her immediately. Meryl Spencer and James' friends get together and organize an outing to celebrate his fifteenth birthday, taking him to a motor carting track and a spa hotel. The cherubs get drunk and James tries to pressure his girlfriend Kerry to have sex with him. She refuses and leaves in tears, but forgives him the next morning. Lauren begins to befriend Anna, but the two of them are picked up by a human trafficking gang. Lauren tries to resist, but is ultimately captured. A paedophile called Keith brings her into a room and tries to rape her, but she stabs him with a knife concealed in her knickers. She rallies the other prostitutes but is pepper sprayed. She manages to make a call to her mission controller John Jones. He calls the police and escapes with Lauren. After a talk with head instructor George Pike, James suspects that Ewart has betrayed him. James is hurt further when Kerry, enraged at him for spilling coffee on her history homework, claims that he screwed his mission. James later asks Kerry to help him investigate, but refuses, so James goes alone. While looking through Ewart's office, James is caught by Dana Smith, another CHERUB agent, who decides to help. From investigating some papers they found in the office, they find out that Ewart has been lying about how much evidence he had. After, Dana admits that she fancies James and they end up kissing. Then it leads to stripping and Dana allows James to see her breasts. However, as things develop Lauren walks in and sees James with Dana's bra in his hand. James tries to wiggle out of trouble by saying it was an accident. Lauren is upset and as James tries to comfort her she says to James that he thinks humping is like eating chips. The next morning Dana and James take one of the CHERUB's pool cars and follow Ewart who meets an old reporter who used to write stories about Lord Hilton, a rival of Denis Obidin (James' mark from the Russia mission) and uncovered links that suggested that Lord Hilton was having people who endangered his son's political career and his own aeroplane business assassinated. He had arranged for Ewart to be killed but James and Dana saved his life for which Zara is very grateful. She apologises for keeping James in the dark and awards him and Dana the black shirt. By now, James had decided that he wants to date Dana. When the new couple go to dinner, Kerry (who found out about their kiss from Lauren) starts a fight with Dana. A food fight breaks out as James sits there, grinning as the fight erupts around him. Critical reception The Fall received an average rating of stars on Goodreads.

The APC participated in direct action events such as sit-ins, squats, and vandalism to protest the closure of low-income housing projects and garnered considerable attention with disruptive protests centred on the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, including the instigation of a small-scale riot on the opening day of the games. According to its website, the Anti-Poverty Committee was \\"an organization of poor and working people, who fight for poor people, their rights and an end to poverty by any means necessary.\\" The APC ceased meeting in the summer of 2010, when they stopped renting an office space for meetings, and is no longer an active organization. Opposition to the 2010 Winter Olympics On a May weekend in 2007, Vancouver Police used a ruse to arrest APC organizer David Cunningham as part of their investigation into threats made to \\"evict\\" 2010 Winter Olympic Games board members from their homes and offices. The police had pretended to be a reporter with Vancouver's commuter newspaper 24 Hours. This ruse was criticised in newspaper editorials as endangering the media's appearance of independence. On May 22, 2007, following Cunningham's arrest, three APC activists pretended to be delivering flowers as a ruse to gain entry to the Vancouver offices of BC Premier Gordon Campbell. The group began destroying glassware, as well as overturning furniture and scattering documents. The group stated that this action was an eviction of 2010 Winter Olympic Games special advisor Ken Dobell from his office.

Tarka was a nominated member to the Nigerian Constitutional Conference of 1957 and was also the representative of the Middle Belt zone to the Willinks Commission of 1958. In 1958, he was appointed as a shadow minister of commerce. Tarka's UMBC, a predominantly Christian party contested the pre-independence election of 1959 and the subsequent election of 1963 against the mainly Moslem Northern People's Congress. Both elections led to violence in the Middle Belt, which contributed to the Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu's inspired military take-over on January 15, 1966. Tarka was an advocate of state creation to give politically and economically empower minority groups within the country. He supported the creation of a Middle Belt state before the republic was truncated. In April 1961, a year after a crisis in Tiv land, Tarka was detained for three weeks in Jos under the cloud of investigation for treason and inciting unrest during the Tiv disturbances., his arrest was a month away from regional elections. In 1962, UMBC which was partly funded by the Action Group decided to end their alliance for a new one with NEPU. The new party was called Northern People's Front with Aminu Kano as President and Tarka as General Secretary. In 1962, along with other Action Group leaders, he was arrested on charges of treasonable felony but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Later career After General Gowon took charge in August 1966, Tarka was appointed Federal Commissioner of Transport and then of Communications, resigning in 1974 after allegations of corruption from a fellow-Tiv named Godwin Daboh were published. Daboh's action was allegedly instigated by Paul Unongo and Benue-Plateau State Governor Joseph Gomwalk and a police probe into the allegations was led by Sunday Adewusi. In the lead-up to restoration of democracy with the Nigerian Second Republic, Tarka aligned with northern politicians to form the National Party of Nigeria, on which platform he unsuccessfully competed in the Presidential elections. He was elected Senator for Benue East in 1979, and was appointed chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriation, a position he held when he died on 30 March 1980, aged 48. His son, Simeon Tarka, was elected to the House of Representatives in 1979.

(According to the High-School Entrance Exam Statistics (1)) Educating language is Turkish. English and German are compulsory foreign languages. Due to the Turkish Education System in 10th grade of school, students select one of the three sections, which are \\"Foreign Language Based\\", \\"Maths-Science Based\\" and \\"Turkish-Maths Based\\". Although the hours of each courses change in this sections, students are responsible all of the main courses like Maths, Turkish, Physics, History etc. Also students can take courses like Drawing, Music, Computer Science, PE etc. Building and Laborities School has got Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Computer Science Laboratories; also Music, Drawing and Foreign Languages rooms. History Before Republic In the last quarter of the 19th century, Ottoman Empire, which was trying to reform its Educational System, did several enterprises to French Education Ministry, after all of these enterprises and the success of Galatasaray Sultanisi (which was founded in the control of the French educator M.Savier), Ottoman decided to open Sultanis in every region. Because of these decisions, Samsun Atat√ºrk Anatolian High School opened with the name \\"Samsun Sultanisi\\" as the first and the only Sultani in Samsun. In 1914 it has served as a military hospital, and on 14 March 1919 with the occupation of Samsun by English forces, its building has been used as Headquarters of (Samsun) English Occupation Forces. After Republic After 1923 the school building is used as Orphans' House. In 1927 the school opened as High-School again and named Samsun Lisesi (Samsun High-School). On 26 October 1930, the school is visited by M.Kemal Atat√ºrk, and he said one of the most famous quotes of him there, \\"Teachers, we set up the Republic but you are the ones who will cause it to rise and make it live.

Biography Zea was born in Mexico City. One of the integral Latin Americanism thinkers in history, Zea became famous thanks to his master's thesis, El Positivismo en M√©xico (Positivism in Mexico, 1943), in which he applied and studied positivism in the context of his country and the world during the transition between the 19th and 20th centuries. With it he began the defense of American Integration, first suggested by the Liberator and Statesman Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, giving it his own interpretation based in the context of neocolonialism during the separation of the American Empire and Mexico. In his works, Zea demonstrates that historical facts aren't independent from ideas, and that they do not arise from what is considered unusual, but from simple reactions to certain situations of human life. In his vision of a united Latin America, he defended his beliefs concerning the place of mankind in the region. Zea explained that the discovery of 1492 was nothing more than a concealment in cultural and known terms, a product of the ideological cross-breeding of the configuration of the Latin American identity, a matter which he revealed on the 5th centenary in 1992. Later, he studied the ontological analysis of Latin America in the cultural and geo- historical planes. Being of poor origin, Zea worked in 1933 in the office of Tel√©grafos Nacionales to help afford the costs of his secondary and university education. Zea was associated with the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) beginning with his training as a professor and philosopher in 1943. In 1947 he founded the Faculty of Philosophy and gave lectures on History of Ideas in America. In 1954, he was appointed to a full-time position as a researcher at the Philosophical Studies Center of the University. In 1966 he became director of the college, holding this position until 1970. During his time as Director he founded the Latin American Studies College (in 1966) and later founded the Coordination and Propagation Center of the UNAM Latin American Studies (1978). He received multiple awards including the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes in 1980, the Premio Interamericano de Cultura \\"Gabriela Mistral\\" (of the OAS) and the Medalla Belisario Dom√≠nguez (of the Senate of Mexico) in 2000. Three years later he was cataloged and honored by the UNAM as the oldest professor to work continually without interruptions until his death. Zea was compared to many diverse political, revolutionary, and intellectual personalities, such as Germ√°n Arciniegas (who was his friend), Che Guevara, Jos√© Gaos (his mentor), V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre, Andr√©s Bello, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and others. His philosophy embodied his concept of a united Latin America, not in the terms of a utopia, but based in reality, and the renewal of the fight for a people in demand for said change. As a result, he opened up the discourse to other scholars of the subject in the future. Publications *Superbus Philosophus *El positivismo en M√©xico.

Knowledge of tropical cyclone rainfall climatology is helpful in the determination of a tropical cyclone rainfall forecast. More rainfall falls in advance of the center of the cyclone than in its wake. The heaviest rainfall falls within its central dense overcast and eyewall. Slow moving tropical cyclones, like Hurricane Danny and Hurricane Wilma, can lead to the highest rainfall amounts due to prolonged heavy rains over a specific location. However, vertical wind shear leads to decreased rainfall amounts, as rainfall is favored downshear and slightly left of the center and the upshear side is left devoid of rainfall. The presence of hills or mountains near the coast, as is the case across much of Mexico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, much of Central America, Madagascar, R√©union, China, and Japan act to magnify amounts on their windward side due to forced ascent causing heavy rainfall in the mountains. A strong system moving through the mid latitudes, such as a cold front, can lead to high amounts from tropical systems, occurring well in advance of its center. Movement of a tropical cyclone over cool water will also limit its rainfall potential. A combination of factors can lead to exceptionally high rainfall amounts, as was seen during Hurricane Mitch in Central America.Federal Emergency Management Agency. Are You Ready? Retrieved on 2006-04-05. Use of forecast models can help determine the magnitude and pattern of the rainfall expected. Climatology and persistence models, such as r-CLIPER, can create a baseline for tropical cyclone rainfall forecast skill. Simplified forecast models, such as the Kraft technique and the eight and sixteen-inch rules, can create quick and simple rainfall forecasts, but come with a variety of assumptions which may not be true, such as assuming average forward motion, average storm size, and a knowledge of the rainfall observing network the tropical cyclone is moving towards. The forecast method of TRaP assumes that the rainfall structure the tropical cyclone currently has changes little over the next 24 hours. The global forecast model which shows the most skill in forecasting tropical cyclone-related rainfall in the United States is the ECMWF IFS (Integrated Forecasting System) http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/tang/tcguidance/ https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/us-forecast-models-have-been-pretty- terrible-during-hurricane-irma/. Rainfall distribution around a tropical cyclone The relative sizes of Typhoon Tip, Cyclone Tracy, and the United States. A larger proportion of rainfall falls in advance of the center (or eye) than after the center's passage, with the highest percentage falling in the right-front quadrant. A tropical cyclone's highest rainfall rates can lie in the right rear quadrant within a training (non-moving) inflow band.Ivan Ray Tannehill. Hurricanes. Princeton University Press: Princeton, 1942. Pages 70-76. Rainfall is found to be strongest in their inner core, within a degree of latitude of the center, with lesser amounts farther away from the center. Most of the rainfall in hurricanes is concentrated within its radius of gale- force winds.Corene J. Matyas. Relating Tropical Cyclone Rainfall Patterns to Storm Size. Retrieved on 2007-02-14. Larger tropical cyclones have larger rain shields, which can lead to higher rainfall amounts farther from the cyclone's center. Storms which have moved slowly, or loop, lead to the highest rainfall amounts. Riehl calculated that of rainfall per day can be expected within one- half degree, or , of the center of a mature tropical cyclone.Herbert Riehl. Tropical Meteorology. McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc.: New York, 1954. Pages 293-297. Many tropical cyclones progress at a forward motion of 10 knots, which would limit the duration of this excessive rainfall to around one- quarter of a day, which would yield about of rainfall. This would be true over water, within of the coastline,Russell Pfost. Tropical Cyclone Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting. Retrieved on 2007-02-25. and outside topographic features. As a cyclone moves farther inland and is cut off from its supply of warmth and moisture (the ocean), rainfall amounts from tropical cyclones and their remains decrease quickly. Vertical wind shear Floyd forcing rainfall near and behind a front to its northeast Vertical wind shear forces the rainfall pattern around a tropical cyclone to become highly asymmetric, with most of the precipitation falling to the left and downwind of the shear vector, or downshear left. In other words, southwesterly shear forces the bulk of the rainfall north-northeast of the center.Shuyi S. Chen, John A. Knaff, and Frank D. Marks, Jr. Effects of Vertical Wind Shear and Storm Motion on Tropical Cyclone Rainfall Asymmetries Deduced from TRMM. Retrieved on 2007-03-28. If the wind shear is strong enough, the bulk of the rainfall will move away from the center leading to what is known as an exposed circulation center. When this occurs, the potential magnitude of rainfall with the tropical cyclone will be significantly reduced. Interaction with frontal boundaries and upper level troughs As a tropical cyclone interacts with an upper-level trough and the related surface front, a distinct northern area of precipitation is seen along the front ahead of the axis of the upper level trough. Surface fronts with precipitable water amounts of or more and upper level divergence overhead east of an upper level trough can lead to significant rainfall.Norman W. Junker. Original Maddox et al. MCS archetypes associated with flash flooding. Retrieved on 2007-06-24.

Tools used in preparation of forecast r-CLIPER for Isabel (2003) Climatology and persistence The Hurricane Research Division of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory created the r-CLIPER (rainfall climatology and persistence) model to act as a baseline for all verification regarding tropical cyclone rainfall. The theory is, if the global forecast models cannot beat predictions based on climatology, then there is no skill in their use. There is a definite advantage to using the forecast track with r-CLIPER because it could be run out 120 hours/5 days with the forecast track of any tropical cyclone globally within a short amount of time.Frank Marks. GPM and Tropical Cyclones. Retrieved on 2007-03-15. The short range variation which uses persistence is the Tropical Rainfall Potential technique (TRaP) technique, which uses satellite-derived rainfall amounts from microwave imaging satellites and extrapolates the current rainfall configuration forward for 24 hours along the current forecast track.Elizabeth Ebert, Sheldon Kusselson, and Michael Turk. Validation of Tropical Rainfall Potential (TRaP) Forecasts for Australian Tropical Cyclones. Retrieved on 2007-03-28. This technique's main flaw is that it assumes a steady state tropical cyclone which undergoes little structural change with time, which is why it is only run forward for 24 hours into the future.Stanley Q.

GFS for Isabel (2003) Numerical weather prediction Computer models can be used to diagnose the magnitude of tropical cyclone rainfall. Since forecast models output their information on a grid, they only give a general idea as to the areal coverage of moderate to heavy rainfall. No current forecast models run at a small enough grid scale (1 km or smaller) to be able to detect the absolute maxima measured within tropical cyclones.

Canada uses a modified version of the Kraft rule which divides the results by a factor of two, which takes into account the lower sea surface temperatures seen around Atlantic Canada and the prevalence of systems undergoing vertical wind shear at their northerly latitudes. The main problem with this rule is that the rainfall observing network is denser than either the synoptic reporting network or the first order station networks, which means the absolute maximum is likely to be underestimated. Another problem is that it does not take the size of the tropical cyclone or topography into account.

Bark-Jones' first international game was a historic Welsh victory over his birth country, England. Wales had failed to win at Twickenham in the first nine attempts, and the Welsh failure at the ground was known as the 'Twickenham bogey'. In an exciting match Bark-Jones played his part with excellent line-out play which was at the heart of the Welsh victory.Smith (1980), pg 276. The game ended 7-3, with all the Welsh points scored by Ronnie Boon.

He was signed to Atlantic Records and released his debut album, Tales of Grime and Grit, in mid-2007 on that label. Joseph is currently continuing his musical career on his own label, Pip Productions, after deciding to leave Atlantic in early 2008. Ruarri released his second album, Both Sides of The Coin, in February 2009. Joseph began work on his third studio album, Shoulder to the Wheel, later the same year, before releasing it independently in February 2010. The album had a wider physical and download release in November 2010, after Joseph secured a new management deal. His fourth studio album, Brother, was released in July 2012. Since 2016 Ruarri has focused his attention on his new, band project, William the Conqueror. Biography=Early life and career Joseph was born in Edinburgh, Scotland and after spending some of his childhood in New Zealand moved to England in his teens. After attempting to pursue a career in London, Joseph moved to Newquay, Cornwall after the birth of his first child. In Cornwall, Joseph continued his career in music and played in a variety of bands such as Eli Bowen and The Rhythm Doctors. As a solo artist, Joseph played with an acoustic guitar and a piano, occasionally accompanied by a band. He finished recording an EP in 2006, \\"All Substance and No Style\\", and after a number of live performances in London attracted record label interest. He toured widely in the UK and made several appearances at music festivals including Glastonbury with the Rhythm Doctors in 2004. Atlantic Records and Tales of Grime and Grit (2007‚Äì2008) He signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 2007. Soon after, Joseph released his debut, digital only EP. Q magazine made its lead track, \\"Patience\\", its track of the day in late April. An 8-track version of his debut album Tales of Grime and Grit was released for download on 3 June 2007. The album was released on 9 July, preceded by the lead single, \\"Tales of Grime and Grit\\", on 2 July. The second single, a revamp of \\"Blankets\\", was released on 24 September. Recording of the album took place at St Merryn Airfield studios in Cornwall, and was produced by the London-based record producer, Paul Reeve. On 24 June 2007, Joseph played at the Glastonbury Festival on Stage 1 (left field).Glastonbury Festivals He has also supported a variety of large acts, including Funeral for a Friend, Paulo Nutini, and more recently David Gray. Post-Atlantic career and Both Sides of The Coin (2008‚Äì2009) In mid- February 2008, Joseph announced on his Myspace page that he had opted to leave Atlantic Records, citing differences in opinion for the release of his second studio album, as the main motivation behind the decision. Joseph's criticism of the attitude fostered by major record labels was vehement, stating that he had been perceived as 'an asset, basically like a car tyre, and if they wanted to, they could melt me down and turn me into condoms!'. Joseph retreated to his garden shed with an assortment of musical instruments to start the recording of his second album, Both Sides of The Coin. Each instrument played in the recordings ‚Äì including guitars, drums, banjo, accordion, and harmonica ‚Äì was played by Joseph. Limited space forced Joseph to move them into his shed one instrument at a time. By the end of the summer of 2008, Both Sides of The Coin was completed. It was released in February 2009. Pip Productions and Shoulder to the Wheel (2009‚Äì2011) Joseph started work on his third studio album in late 2009 and released early demos of potential tracks through his Myspace page. Shoulder to the Wheel was released in February 2010 through his own independent record label, Pip Productions. In October of the same year, Joseph secured a management deal with ACP Recordings, who also handle David Gray, Spiritualized, and Damien Rice. Shoulder to the Wheel was thus allowed a wider download release in November 2010, with 'Orchard for an Apple' being chosen as the lead single. The album peaked at number 8 on the iTunes singer- songwriter chart, and Joseph has been touring extensively post-release. A single mix of 'Orchard for an Apple', featuring new backing vocals and instrumentation, was played on BBC Radio 2 by Alex Lester. Lester announced that the single was due for release on 3 January 2011, coinciding with Joseph's birthday. The song has also had airplay on Steve Wright's daytime Radio 2 show. In December 2010, the song was added to the BBC Radio 2 Playlist, where it remained for three weeks. Joseph embarked on an extensive tour of Shoulder to the Wheel throughout 2011 and early 2012, playing at various venues across the UK including a gig at the Union Chapel, Islington, supporting Foy Vance. Brother (2012‚Äì2016) Joseph started work on his fourth studio album shortly after losing a close friend in 2010; he credits this loss as a great influence on the making of the record in a YouTube video released in June 2012. In January 2012, Joseph announced on his website that the record had been completed and a release date was approaching. Joseph recorded Brother in The Church Studios, London, being the first of his productions since Tales of Grime and Grit to be recorded with a full band in a studio setting. The one-word title symbolizes \\"companionship, community, and closeness.\\" The album underwent a limited release in the UK on 9 October 2012, and a wider digital release on iTunes and Spotify on 25 March 2013. William the Conqueror (2017-) Joseph's current project is a three piece band called 'William the Conqueror', alongside friends and previous collaborators Harry Harding (drums) and Naomi Holmes (bass). After signing to Loose, their first album, Proud Disturber of the Peace, was released in August 2017. The band marks a new direction for Joseph, having been described by critics as 'Southern rock with a British twist'. Joseph describes the band as a reaction to his previous work, going in a direction that his teenage self would have appreciated. The second William the Conqueror album, Bleeding on the Soundtrack, was released in 2019, followed by a UK tour in May 2019, which included a live session for Ricky Ross on his BBC Radio Scotland programme, Another Country. On 24 November 2019 William The Conqueror played a session for Cerys Matthews on BBC 6 Music. Personal life The year preceding the release of Shoulder to the Wheel was a particularly turbulent time in the musician's personal life. His eldest son underwent emergency brain surgery in mid-2009, and his wife gave birth to their third child at around the same time. Shoulder to the Wheel is dedicated to a family member, with whom Joseph was close, who died during the making of the record. Joseph married his long term girlfriend in 2009, and together they have three children - He resides with his family in Cornwall. Critical reception The response to Ruarri's albums critically has been positive, and they have met with modest commercial success. Critics generally commended Joseph's first album, Tales of Grime and Grit. Daniel Black of Contactmusic.com, whilst having reservations about the opening songs, stated that \\"The rest of the album was a collection of some of the greatest songs you'll ever hear under the one album\\", eventually giving three and a half stars. Matt Clutton of online music magazine Gigwise.com praised Joseph's \\"uniquely husky, gravely vocals\\" and \\"expertly orchestrated acoustics\\" in his review of the single Blankets. In terms of commercial reception, Amazon.com has posted an average customer review score of four stars out of five stars, from 53 reviews. Ruarri Joseph's second album, Both Sides of the Coin, has been greeted with a positive reception. Femalefirst.co.uk called the album \\"an intriguing collection of understated songs\\" giving it four stars, and a five-star review from Caroline McCarthy of Allgigs.co.uk described the songs as \\"beautiful\\" and \\"wistful\\". Shoulder to the Wheel has met with very positive reviews. Comfortcomes.com said Joseph \\"combines poetry, a serious edge and a soothing acoustic touch to impressive effect throughout\\", whilst Entertainment Focus described Ruarri as \\"an interesting and exciting talent\\" in their review for 'Orchard for an Apple'. Although few US-based music magazines have reviewed the album, one review from Directcurrentmusic.com highlighted that Joseph \\"rises above the mass of mediocrity\\" and was \\"worthy of greater exposure\\" in the United States. Entertainment-Focus gave the album a glowing five-star review, calling the record \\"hugely rewarding\\" and a \\"gorgeous, understated collection of songs\\". A slightly more mixed review came from Nima Baniamer of Contactmusic.com. Giving the album three stars, the review stated that the LP \\"does have major failures\\", although he praised lead single 'Orchard for an Apple' and described the opening songs as \\"beautiful\\" and \\"haunting\\". British newspapers The Independent, Metro, and Uncut all gave Shoulder to the Wheel three stars.

Situated on the Drammen Line, from Oslo Central Station, it also serves as the terminus of the Asker Line and the Spikkestad Line. The station is located just southwest of the Asker Tunnel and the Skaugum Tunnel, and just northeast the Lier√•sen Tunnel. Vy serves the station with local, regional and intercity trains. It is also served by the Airport Express Train and serves as the main bus terminal for the town. The station has six tracks and four platforms, consisting of two island platforms and two side platforms. The station had 8,400 daily passengers in 2008. The station opened along with the Drammen Line on 7 October 1872. The original station building was designed by Georg Andreas Bull in Swiss chalet style. The station underwent a renewal from 1917 to 1922, receiving gauge conversion to standard gauge, electrification and a new station building designed by Ragnvald Utne. Double track was laid from 1955 to 1958, including building the Asker Tunnel just northeast of the station, and a new station building opened in 1960. The Lier√•sen Tunnel opened in 1973, cutting the distance to Drammen, and resulted in the old line becoming the Spikkestad Line. The station received an overhaul in 1998 and again in 2006. The latter was in conjunction with the construction of the Asker Line. History=Construction and initial station The first public transport between Asker and Christiania (Oslo) commenced in 1866, when a ferry would was started up.Mamen (1963): 113 The decision to build the Drammen Line was taken by Parliament on 16 June 1869. Ground on the farm of Fusdal was selected for the station to serve Asker.Thue (1963): 49 The first station building was designed by Georg Andreas Bull. Known as the Asker Class, a similar design was used for another eleven train stations on the Drammen- and Randsfjorden Lines. The original station building was among the most spacious and elaborate for its size category.Hartmann (1997): 48 Built in Swiss chalet style, it featured a saddle roof and was split between a public area and a residence for the station master. Unusual for stations at the time the residential door was on the front, rather than the side, of the building. The station was decorated in fretsaw ornaments in organic and Gothic styles.Hartmann (1997): 49 The line and Asker Station opened on 7 October 1872.Bjerke & Holom (2004): 194 From 1875 Asker Station had four employees: a station master, a telegraphist and two carriers. The station served 17,466 passengers that year, rising to 33,851 in 1900.Thue (1984): 41 Travel time from Asker to Oslo West Station was about an hour. The arrival of the railway in Asker resulted in city dwellers buying or renting holiday homes in Asker.Mamen (1963): 115 There was at first little settlements around the station, but as it generated traffic the interest for the area grew through the 1870s. Soon the neighborhood's general store moved to the vicinity of the station.Thue (1963): 93 A Narvesen kiosk opened at the station at about the turn of the century.Thue (1984): 219 Growth was gradual. From 1910 Statistics Norway registered Asker Station as a settlement, with 20 building and 184 residents. Standard gauge The traffic on the line rose quickly. Within a few decades the Drammen Line was serving the Vestfold Line, the Randsfjorden Line and the S√∏rlandet Line. The line was soon found to be underdimensioned and delays were common.Mamen (1963): 114 To meet the higher traffic levels, a major upgrade of the Drammen Line was carried out from 1917 to 1922. For Asker this involved gauge conversion from narrow to standard gauge and electrification. The segment from Asker to Sandvika was converted to dual gauge on 15 December 1918. This arrangement of a mix of standard and narrow gauge rolling stock lasted until 13 November 1922, from which time only standard gauge stock was used. Meanwhile, the line was also electrified, which was taken into use on 26 November 1922.Bjerke & Holom (2004): 196 Asker Station in 1923 As part of the upgrade to the line an all-new station building was built at Asker. Designed by Ragnvald Utne at NSB Arkitektkontor, it was completed in 1921. During the first decades of the twentieth century the number of commuters into Oslo grew rapidly. In 1890 there were only five people with month or yearly passes commuting to Oslo, while this rose to 432 in 1930.Thue (1984): 153 By 1939 there were two bus services corresponding with the trains at Asker: one to Slemmestad and one to Dikemark and no:Vard√•sen.Thue (1984): 168 Construction of double track between Asker and Sandvika was carried out between 1953 and 1958. The second segment, from a point north of the Asker Tunnel to Hvalstad Station opened on 29 November 1955. The new Asker Tunnel, located immediately northwest of the station, opened on 8 December 1958, completing the new segment of double track.Bjerke & Holom (2004): 195 The tunnel was taken into use in two steps: the one track on 8 October and the second on 8 December.Bjerke & Holom (2004): 189 In conjunction with this a new station was built, designed by NSB Arkitektkontor and opened in 1960. Tunnels The Lier√•sen Tunnel was built to allow double track to Drammen and cut the route west of Asker by . Construction started in 1963, but the tunnel was delayed due to geological challenges and opened on 3 June 1973. The old section of track from Asker to Spikkestad was kept and became the Spikkestad Line. With the opening of the tunnel the local train routes were rearranged, so that there were two trains from Asker to Oslo each hour and one train each hour to Spikkestad and Drammen, respectively. These served all stations from Asker to Sandvika and then ran directly to Oslo. Class 69 train heading off on the Spikkestad Line, with the Lier√•sen Tunnel to the right Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk took over operations of the bus routes in Asker from 1 January 1975 and started to feed the bus services to Asker Station rather than drive directly downtown. From mid 1984 NSB terminated express train stops at Asker, but these returned the following year. The old station at Asker burned down on 24 June 1992. The section from Asker to Drammen received centralized traffic control with the opening of the Lier√•sen Tunnel, while the section from Asker to Sandvika did not receive this until 14 December 1993. Automatic train stop was introduced from Asker to Drammen on 1 June 1987, while the segment from Asker to Sandvika received it on 12 December 1993. Planning of a new station design started in the early 1990s, originally with focus on developing it as a renewal project to make the town center in Asker more attractive. It kept the existing station building, but it was significantly upgraded in a design by Niels Torp. The underpass was closed and replaced with an overpass, and the new station received five tracks. The upgrades were timed to allow the station to act as the terminus for the Airport Express Train, which commenced services that year. The work also saw the construction of a new parking house. The Asker Line was built to allow regional trains to bypass local trains on the Drammen Line, increasing both capacity, speed and regularity through the West Corridor. The first segment was the section from Asker to Sandvika, which started in 2001 and was opened on 27 August 2005. Upgrades of Asker Station were carried out from 2002. It involved both upgrades to the station itself and construction of a culvert acting as the entrance to the Skaugum Tunnel. The station was rebuilt from five to six tracks. Construction was carried out in such a way that four tracks were at any time kept in operation, starting from the east and working westwards. Facilities Asker Station is situated on the Drammen Line, at a distance of from Oslo Central Station at an elevation of above mean sea level. The station is the terminus of two other lines: it is the southwestern terminus of the double-tracked Asker Line and the northeastern terminus of the single-tracked Spikkestad Line. To the northeast of the station all tracks run into a twin-tubed tunnel, one tube which is the Asker Tunnel on the Drammen Line. The other is the Skaugum Tunnel of the Asker Line. To the southwest the main tracks on the Drammen Line run into the Lier√•sen Tunnel, while the Spikkestad Line branches off to the south. Class 70 train (left) and an Airport Express Train The station has six tracks, served by two island platforms and two side platforms. They are numbered 1 through 6, with track 1 closest to the town. It is located at a bus terminal, operated by Akershus Kollektivterminaler. The station is not manned, but is equipped with ticket vending machines and features and indoor waiting room and kiosk. All platforms are covered. The station features locked bicycle parking, a taxi stand, and 544 parking spaces. The station is located next to the town square in Asker. The station has been built to give a monumental impression, with the platforms, bus terminal and walkways built with a common style, using untreated concrete, untreated wood, glass, steel and zinc roofs. The walkways have been built with massive, visible wooden girders.Torp (1997): 44 The underpass has been decorated by artists Sven P√•hlsson and Erik W√∏llo. It includes LED-lights aimed along the concrete walls which vary their colors and a sound track playing electronic music. An estimated 4,500 people live within one kilometer (0.6 mi) from the station, and 8,900 people within two kilometers (1.2 mi). There are about 4,500 jobs within one kilometer (0.6 mi) of the station. Asker is one of four transit hubs located outside Oslo on the Drammen Line, along with Drammen Station, Sandvika Station and Lysaker Station. It is, just marginally, the busiest of these, with about 8,400 passengers per day in 2008. Services The station's six tracks seen from the walkway Vy serves Asker Station both with Oslo Commuter Rail trains as well as regional trains. Regarding the former, L1 trains, which run northwards along the Drammen Line and southwards along the Spikkestad Line, run every half-hour. L12 to Kongsberg and Eidsvoll runs every hour, while L14, which runs along the Kongsvinger Line, runs hourly and terminates at Asker. These and regional trains run along the Asker Line.

He entered the army in 1722 as a cornet in the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, and in the following year joined Charles Churchill's Regiment of Dragoons as a captain. While serving under Col. Churchill, Elliot witnessed the will of Churchill's mistress, the celebrated actress Anne Oldfield, and was one of the pallbearers at her funeral in 1730. Elliot inherited his father's estate of Wells, in Roxburghshire, in 1728. In 1737, Elliot was commissioned as major of the 2nd Troop of Horse Grenadier Guards, of which he was made lieutenant- colonel in 1741. He fought at both Dettingen and Fontenoy, but resigned his commission in 1746. His eldest sister's son, George Augustus Eliott (later Lord Heathfield, defender of Gibraltar), was one of his subordinate officers in the 2nd Troop of Horse Grenadier Guards. In 1741, Elliot was elected as a Whig Member of Parliament (MP) for Calne, Wiltshire (which seat he held until 1754). Subsequently, in 1743, he was made one of the equerries to George II, and served until the king's death in 1760. Family Elliot married - against her father's wishes - Lady Frances de Nassau d‚ÄôAuverquerque, elder daughter of the Earl of Grantham and Lady Henrietta Butler, daughter of the Earl of Ossory, at St Benet Paul's Wharf, London, on 4 June 1737, with one son: * Henry Elliot, born 17 April 1741 Westminster, who died young. In 1758, Lady Frances would have inherited the Scottish title lordship of Dingwall upon the death of her uncle the Earl of Arran, had this title not been forfeited as a consequence of the 1715 attainder of her uncle the Duke of Ormonde following his involvement in the Jacobite risings of that year.Gascoyne et al., The Complete Peerage, vol. 3, pp. 128-29. William Elliot died in 1764 and was buried in St James's Church, Piccadilly, Westminster. Lady Frances Elliot died on 5 April 1772, and was buried with her late husband.

Throughout this article, the names of \\"would-have-been\\" monarchs are in italics. Abdication of Richard II Richard II abdicated in favour of Henry Bolingbroke on 29 September 1399. However, Henry was not next in the line to the throne; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who descended from Edward III's second surviving son, Lionel of Antwerp, whereas Henry's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's third surviving son. Had Edmund inherited instead, the alternative succession would have been short-lived, for it re-united with the historical crown when Edward IV was declared king in 1461. # Edward III of England # Edward, the Black Prince, first son of Edward III # Richard II of England, second son of Edward, the Black Prince # Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, third son (second son to survive infancy) of Edward III # Philippa Plantagenet, 5th Countess of Ulster, only child of Lionel # Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, first son of Philippa # Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, first son of Roger # Anne de Mortimer, first daughter, third line of Roger # Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, only son of Anne # Edward IV of England, first son of Richard Descendants of George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence This line's claim to the Crown is based upon the argument that Edward IV was not the son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and thus had no legitimate claim to the Crown. Therefore, when Richard was killed at the Battle of Wakefield, his claim passed first to his eldest legitimate son, Edmund, Earl of Rutland, who was executed shortly after the battle, and then to George, Duke of Clarence. Supporters of the Clarence claim also draw on the debated validity of Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, which allows them to argue that, even if Edward was legitimate, his children were not. Another point is that Henry VI passed a law in 1470 that should both he and his son Edward of Westminster die without further legitimate issue, the crown was to pass to Clarence, as Henry had placed an attainder upon Edward IV. When Henry died in 1471 (Prince Edward having died in battle shortly before), Clarence (who could claim descent from John of Gaunt, as could his wife Isabella Neville) became the legal heir to Henry VI and the House of Lancaster. The current descendant of this line is Simon Abney-Hastings, 15th Earl of Loudoun. The line of succession is as follows: # George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, third son (second \\"legitimate\\" son) of Richard, 3rd Duke of York # Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick, first son of George # Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury, daughter of George # Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu, first son of Margaret # Henry Pole, second son of Henry # Catherine Hastings, first daughter, third line of Henry, 1st Baron Montagu # Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, first son of Catherine # George Hastings, 4th Earl of Huntingdon, second son of Catherine # Francis Hastings, first son of George # Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon, only son of Francis # Ferdinando Hastings, 6th Earl of Huntingdon, first son of Henry # Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon, only son of Ferdinando # George Hastings, 8th Earl of Huntingdon, second son of Theophilus # Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon, third son of Theophilus # Francis Hastings, 10th Earl of Huntingdon, first son of Theophilus, 9th Earl # Elizabeth Rawdon, 16th Baroness Botreaux, only daughter, second line of Theophilus, 9th Earl # Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings, first son of Elizabeth # George Rawdon-Hastings, 2nd Marquess of Hastings, eldest legitimate son of Francis # Paulyn Rawdon-Hastings, 3rd Marquess of Hastings, first son of George # Henry Rawdon-Hastings, 4th Marquess of Hastings, second son of George # Edith Rawdon-Hastings, 10th Countess of Loudoun, first daughter, third line of George # Charles Rawdon-Hastings, 11th Earl of Loudoun, first son of Edith # Paulyn Francis Cuthbert Rawdon-Hastings, second son of Edith # Edith Maud Abney-Hastings, 12th Countess of Loudoun, first daughter, third line of Paulyn # Ian Huddleston Abney-Hastings, Lord Mauchline, only son of Edith # Barbara Abney-Hastings, 13th Countess of Loudoun, first daughter, second line of Edith # Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun, eldest son of Barbara # Simon Abney-Hastings, 15th Earl of Loudoun, eldest son of Michael Descendants of Mary Tudor, Queen of France Henry VIII's Third Succession Act granted Henry the right to bequeath the Crown in his Will. His Will specified that, in default of heirs to his children, the throne was to pass to the children of the daughters of his younger sister Mary Tudor, Queen of France, bypassing the line of his elder sister Margaret Tudor, represented by the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots. Edward VI confirmed this by letters patent. The legitimate and legal heir of Elizabeth I was therefore Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven (the marriage of Lady Catherine Grey having been annulled, and her children declared illegitimate, by Elizabeth I). Her succession, under this theory, follows: # Henry VIII of England # Edward VI of England, only son of Henry # Mary I of England, eldest daughter of Henry # Elizabeth I of England, second daughter of Henry # Mary Tudor, Queen of France, second daughter, sixth line of Henry VII # Lady Eleanor Brandon, second daughter, third line of Mary # Lady Margaret Clifford, only daughter, third line of Eleanor # Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby, first son of Margaret # Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven, first daughter, first line of Ferdinando # George Brydges, 6th Baron Chandos, first son of Anne # Margaret Brydges, first daughter, first line of George # George Brydges Skipwith, first son of Margaret # Elizabeth Brownlow, first daughter, second line of Margaret # George Brownlow Doughty, first son of Elizabeth # Henry Doughty, only child of George # Henry Doughty, only son of Henry # Elizabeth Doughty, only daughter of Henry Snr Since Lady Anne Stanley's line is thought to have become extinct with the death of Elizabeth Doughty, the line then passes to the descendants of Lady Anne's sister, Lady Frances Stanley: # Lady Frances Stanley, second daughter, second line of Ferdinando # John Egerton, 2nd Earl of Bridgewater, first son of Frances # John Egerton, 3rd Earl of Bridgewater, first son of John # Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater, third son of John, 3rd Earl # Lady Anne Egerton, first daughter, fifth line of Scroop # George Villiers, 4th Earl of Jersey, only child of Anne # George Child Villiers, 5th Earl of Jersey, first son of George, 4th Earl # George Child Villiers, 6th Earl of Jersey, first son of George, 5th Earl # Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey, only son of George, 6th Earl # George Child Villiers, 8th Earl of Jersey, first son of Victor # George Child Villiers, 9th Earl of Jersey, first son of George # Lady Caroline Child Villiers, only child of George's first marriage Lady Caroline's heir-apparent is her son Timothy Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 7th Earl of Minto. Although the 9th Earl of Jersey had sons from a third marriage, he had been divorced from his first wife, who was still alive when he married his third. Under a strict adherence to the succession laws and customs as they existed in 1603, it is argued that no laws passed by Parliament since 1603 are legitimate, as the heirs did not summon those Parliaments, nor did those laws receive the royal assent to become law. Under the law as it stood in 1603, the 9th Earl of Jersey's divorce was not valid, and therefore both his remarriage during his ex-wife's lifetime was null and void, and the children of his third marriage illegitimate. Consequently, the current holder of the Stanley claim to the throne of England is the only child of the 9th Earl's first marriage, Lady Caroline Ogilvy (n√©e Child Villiers). By a twist of fate her husband's family are themselves highly ranked in the (accepted) line of succession to the British throne, with Lady Caroline's nephew James Ogilvy being 54th in line as of 2020. There is doubt of the legitimacy of Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp. Certainly James I regarded the Seymour line as legitimate, and based his own succession on his right by primogeniture, ignoring the Will of Henry VIII. However, the Seymours were placed ahead of the Stanleys in James's line of succession. In 2012, Mary Freeman-Grenville, 12th Lady Kinloss was listed as the heir to the Mary Tudor claim rather than Frances Stanley's descendants. Her succession follows: # Henry VIII of England # Edward VI of England, only son of Henry # Mary I of England, eldest daughter of Henry # Elizabeth I of England, second daughter of Henry # Mary Tudor, Queen of France, third daughter, sixth line of Henry # Lady Frances Brandon, first daughter, second line of Mary # Lady Catherine Grey, second daughter, second line of Frances # Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp, first son of Catherine # William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset, second son of Edward # Henry Seymour, Lord Beauchamp, third son of William # Lady Elizabeth Seymour, only daughter, second line of Henry # Charles Bruce, 3rd Earl of Ailesbury, second son of Elizabeth # Lady Mary Bruce, first daughter, third line on Charles # James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos, only son of Mary # Lady Anne Elizabeth Brydges, only child of James # Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, first son of Anne # Richard Temple-Nugent- Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, only son of Richard # Mary Morgan-Grenville, 11th Lady Kinloss, first daughter of Richard # Luis Chandos Francis Temple Morgan-Grenville, second son of Mary # Mary Freeman-Grenville, 12th Lady Kinloss, first daughter of Luis # Teresa Freeman- Grenville, 13th Lady Kinloss, first daughter, second line of Mary Lady Kinloss's heir-presumptive is her sister Hester Josephine Anne Freeman- Grenville, who is married to Peter Haworth and has three sons. Continuation of the House of Stuart The Catholic heirs of the deposed James II of England were passed over by the Act of Settlement 1701. # Charles I of England # James II of England, second son of Charles I # James Francis Edward Stuart, only son of James II; called \\"James III\\" by Jacobites. # Charles Edward Stuart, elder son of James Francis. He had no legitimate issue by his wife. He had an illegitimate daughter who has descendants, but they have no succession rights. Also known as \\"Charles III\\" by Jacobites or as \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\" more widely. # Henry Benedict Stuart, younger son of James Francis. He was a Cardinal of the Catholic Church and had no children. Called \\"Henry IX\\" by Jacobites. At Henry's death the claim passed to his second cousin twice removed, Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia, and then to his brother Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia. Charles Emmanuel and Victor Emmanuel were great-great- great-grandsons of King Charles I. # Charles I of England # Henrietta Anne Stuart, youngest daughter, final line of Charles # Anne Marie d'Orl√©ans, second daughter, third line of Henrietta Anne # Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, second son of Anne Marie # Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia, second son of Charles Emmanuel # Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia, eldest son of Victor Amadeus # Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia, second son of Victor Amadeus # Maria Beatrice of Savoy, eldest daughter, second line of Victor Emmanuel #Francis V, Duke of Modena, elder son of Maria Beatrice # Archduke Ferdinand Karl Viktor of Austria-Este, younger son of Maria Beatrice # Maria Theresa of Austria-Este, only child of Ferdinand # Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, eldest son of Maria Theresia # Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria, second son of Rupprecht # Franz, Duke of Bavaria, elder son of Albrecht When Franz dies, his claim on the English and Scottish crownsThe Jacobite claim is to the thrones held and claimed by James II and VII; as king of England, Scotland, France (claimed by English monarchs since the Hundred Years' War), and Ireland. The Acts of Union that created Great Britain and the United Kingdom are considered invalid by those who believe that the monarchs who gave the Acts the Royal Assent were not the legitimate occupants of the throne. Cf. The Legitimist Kalendar for the Year of Our Lord 1895 (London: Henry, 1895), p.22. will pass to his younger brother Max. And after Max's death, this possible claim most likely will be inherited by the Prince of Liechtenstein through the Hereditary Princess. A final claim comes from Peter Pininski who claims descent from the legitimised descendants of Charles Edward Stuart alias \\"the Young Pretender\\", through the Rohan or Roehenstadt family. However, his claim is disputed by scholars who point out that the Rohans were a large family and it is easy to confuse its many members. \\"Marie Victoire Adelaide\\" may be confused with another member of the family called Marie Victoire, who is not descended from the Stuarts. # Charles I of England. # James II of England, third son of Charles I. # James Francis Edward Stuart, only son of James II, \\"the Old Pretender\\". # Charles Edward Stuart, eldest son of James Francis, \\"the Young Pretender\\". # Charlotte Stuart, Duchess of Albany, only surviving daughter with his mistress Clementina Walkinshaw. Legitimised in 1784. # Charles Edward Stuart, Count Roehenstart, illegitimate son of Charlotte, raised in secret but later claimed legitimacy and the throne as an adult. # Marie Victoire Adelaide, illegitimate daughter of Charlotte, raised in secrecy. # Antime, son of Marie Victoire and Paul Anthony Louis Bertrand de Nikorowicz. # Charles, son of Antime. # Julia-Th√©r√®se, sister of Charles and married Baron Pininski. # Stanislas Pininski, elder son of Julia-Th√©r√®se. # Leon Pininski, second son of Julia-Th√©r√®se. # Ladislas Pininski, elder nephew of Stanilas and Leon. # Stanislas Pininski, nephew of Ladislas. # Peter Pininski, son of Stanislas (extant).

The United States tropical cyclone rainfall climatology concerns the amount of precipitation, primarily in the form of rain, which occurs during tropical cyclones and their extratropical cyclone remnants across the United States. Typically, five tropical cyclones and their remnants impact the country each year, contributing between a tenth and a quarter of the annual rainfall across the southern tier of the country. The highest rainfall amounts appear close to the coast, with lesser amounts falling farther inland. Obstructions to the precipitation pattern, such as the Appalachian mountains, focus higher amounts from northern Georgia through New England. While most impacts occur with systems moving in from the Atlantic ocean or Gulf of Mexico, some emanate from the eastern Pacific ocean, with a few crossing Mexico before impacting the Southwest. Those making landfall within the Southeast portion of the country tend to have the greatest potential for heavy rains. Long-term averages On average, five North Atlantic hurricanes or their remnants lead to rainfall across the contiguous United States each year, contributing between a tenth and a quarter of the annual rainfall to the southern United States. While many of these storms form in the Atlantic basin, some systems or their remnants move through Mexico from the Eastern Pacific basin. Tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific bring nearly 20 percent of the average annual rainfall to southern California. The average storm total rainfall for a tropical cyclone impacting the contiguous United States from the Atlantic basin is about , with 70 to 75 percent of the storm total falling within a 24‚Äëhour period. Highest known amounts for the United States since 1950 Below is a list of the top ten highest known storm total rainfall amounts from individual tropical cyclones across the United States since 1950. Four of the wettest systems struck Texas, three strongly impacted Hawaii, while two others made their biggest mark on Florida, and another impacted Puerto Rico. Flooding in Port Arthur, Texas caused by Hurricane Harvey. Harvey was both the wettest and costliest tropical cyclone in United States history. # - Harvey 2017 in Nederland, Texas # - Lane 2018 in Mountainview, Hawaii # - Hiki 1950 at the Kanalohuluhulu Ranger Station, Hawaii # - Amelia 1978 in Medina, Texas # - Easy 1950 in Yankeetown, Florida # - Claudette 1979 in Alvin, Texas # - T.D. # 15 1970 in Jayuya, Puerto Rico # - Allison 2001 in northwest Jefferson County, Texas # - Paul 2000 at the Kapapala Ranch 36, Hawaii # - Georges 1998 in Munson, Florida Maximum per state for the contiguous United States U.S. tropical cyclone rainfall maxima per state State maxima relating to tropical cyclones and their remnants are shown on the left, color-coded by amount. Tropical cyclones from the Atlantic basin have the most sway along the Gulf coast and Eastern Seaboard. The impact of tropical cyclones and their remnants originally from the eastern Pacific stretches as far east as Michigan and Indiana. Rainfall related to the low pressure area once associated with a tropical cyclone, or its remnants aloft, are included in this sample. No additional rainfall from pre-existing upper lows as seen before cyclones such as Hurricane Fran of 1996 or from upper cyclones that closed off behind former tropical cyclones such as Hurricane Juan of 1985 was included. The state of Texas has the highest amounts, followed by Florida, Alabama, North Carolina, and Mississippi. In the western United States, the same can be said for the remnants of Hurricane Kathleen of 1976 in California, and the remnants of Tropical Storm Nora of 1997 in Arizona. In addition, some rainfall records across the Midwest occurred during Tropical Storm Candy of 1968. U.S. Tropical Cyclone Rainfall Accumulations per time frame Average and record statistics per time frame for the contiguous United States To the right is a graphic showing averages and extremes for a 15-year sample of tropical cyclones and their remnants affecting the contiguous United States. The units of the rainfall amounts are in inches, while the time units are in hours. The bars in the graph express the percent of the storm total rainfall, which is defined to be 100 percent in the final column. Note that, on average, as much as one- fourth of the total occurs in 2‚Äì3 hours, while half falls within 12 hours, and almost three-quarters of the storm total falls within a 24‚Äëhour period. Cases where a cyclone scraped the coast were not separated out from those that made a more direct landfall. Also, Pacific and Atlantic cases were not separated. This all explains the average storm total of the sample being depressed to . On the bottom of the graphic are listed the averages per time frame and the records. The records were mainly set during Tropical Storm Allison of 2001 and Hurricane Danny of 1997. This graphic will be updated as the climatology pushes farther back in time. United States rules of thumb for forecasting=Kraft rule During the late 1950s, this rule of thumb came into being, developed by R. H. Kraft.Frank Marks. WSR-88D Derived Rainfall Distributions in Hurricane Danny (1997). Retrieved on 2007-04-13. It was noted from rainfall amounts (in imperial units) reported by the first order rainfall network in the United States that the storm total rainfall fit a simple equation: 100 divided by the speed of motion in knots.Norman W. Junker. Hurricanes and Extreme Rainfall. Retrieved on 2007-03-15. This rule works as long as a tropical cyclone is moving and only the first order or synoptic station network (with observations spaced about apart) are used to derive storm totals. Canada uses a modified version of the Kraft rule which divides the results by a factor of two, which takes into account the lower sea surface temperatures seen around Atlantic Canada and the prevalence of systems undergoing vertical wind shear at their northerly latitudes.David M. Roth Tropical Cyclone Rainfall (July 2007 presentation). Retrieved on 2007-07-19. The main problem with this rule is that the rainfall observing network is denser than either the synoptic reporting network or the first order station networks, which means the absolute maximum is likely to be underestimated. Another problem is that it does not take the size of the tropical cyclone or topography into account. Eight inch or 203 mm rule Rusty Pfost, now the head of the Miami National Weather Service Forecast Office, did a study in 1999 reviewing rainfall totals from tropical systems affecting Florida between 1960 and 1998. He found that for tropical cyclones moving at greater than 6 knots, the average storm total was normally in the 5-10 inch (127-254 mm) range. Slower moving storms usually forced greater than of rain to fall. Sixteen inch or 406 mm rule U.S. Tropical Cyclone Rainfall Accumulations per time frame David Roth, a forecaster at the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center, determined that the average amount for all tropical cyclones impacting the United States was between 1991 and 2005.David Roth. Tropical Cyclone QPF. Retrieved on 2007-03-15. When removing the storms that grazed the domain, an average of near was obtained.David Roth. Developing a Recent Tropical Cyclone Rainfall Climatology For the United States. 25th Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology. American Meteorological Society, 2002. Using this latter amount appears to work best for systems that experience little vertical wind shear and are of at least average size. Amounts measured in small/midget tropical cyclones showed storm total amounts closer to . Operationally, variations to these amounts are introduced if the cyclone encounters mountain zones, interacts with a nearby front, or the storm is significantly sheared.

The air date is March 18, 2007. In 2008 the episode was selected as one of the \\"25 Sexiest TV Shows on DVD\\" by magazine Entertainment Weekly. Plot summary Rome is facing a dire shortage of grain, forcing Octavian to barter with Mark Antony to get new shipments sent from Egypt. Mark Antony and Cleopatra continually increase their demands in exchange for grain, eventually driving away Octavian's negotiator. In so doing, Antony hopes to push Octavian into declaring war, which Antony believes he can win due to his support among the Roman people. As a last resort to sway public sentiment to his side, Octavian sends Atia and Octavia to Alexandria, knowing that Antony will reject his lover and lawful wife respectively. Octavian is proven correct: Antony refuses to see Atia and Octavia (because he's in the middle of having sex with Cleopatra) and sends them back to Rome, enraging the citizens of Rome who wonder how their former hero could slight his Roman wife in favor of the \\"Egyptian whore.\\" Posca secretly leaves Antony's service with Jocasta and defects back to Octavian, returning to Rome with Atia and Octavia. Lucius Vorenus, who has been telling Caesarion ambiguous stories about Caesarion's father (the boy believes his father to be Julius Caesar though Vorenus is speaking of Titus Pullo), chooses to stay in Alexandria with Antony. Octavian greets Atia upon her return to Rome, where Posca also delivers to him the last will and testament of Antony and Cleopatra (historically, the Donations of Alexandria), in which Antony declares Cleopatra his wife and leaves Egypt and the eastern provinces to his children by her and control of Rome and the west to Caesarion. Octavian uses this as evidence that Antony has gone mad and has become a threat to the state, spreading the news to the people and gaining the Senate's support in a war against Antony. Octavian summons Titus Pullo for a personal audience in the Senate house and requests that Pullo come with him to Egypt, hoping that Pullo could reason with Vorenus and mediate for Antony. Pullo expresses his doubts, but agrees to escort Octavian. At the Aventine Collegium, where Pullo is rationing out grain to increasingly restless Romans, Pullo makes final arrangements with his men and Vorenus' children, and leaves Mascius in charge. However, the night before Pullo leaves, he is attacked by Memmio, who Pullo had imprisoned in a small cage since his defeat in the gang wars. Memmio knocks Pullo unconscious and moves in to kill him with a knife. Gaia intervenes and kills Memmio, but she is severely wounded.

Biography=Early life She was formerly Irina Malandina before the marriage in 1991. She is sometimes referred to in Russian newspaper profiles as \\"zolotaya kletka\\"- (gilded cage) - in reference to her privileged yet constrained existence, and is reported to speak English well. Her upbringing was humble, her parents waited on tables in Russia. Her father was a man named Vyacheslav, a waiter who died in a tragic accident when she was just two, and her mother's name was Alla. Education and family Irina studied at Moscow State University, specializing in fine arts, and then with the help of her aunt was able to get a job as an airline stewardess at Aeroflot in the international flights division. It was here that she met Roman Abramovich after he gave her his card on a flight. They were later married and have 5 children: Anna, Arkady, Sofia, Arina and Ilya. While Russian, the family was based out of the United Kingdom in London, where Roman owns the football club Chelsea. Irina has been named as one of the ten most powerful and influential blondes in the world, she appears to have had some part helping in Roman's businesses, and to manage his wealth at times, in addition to raising the 5 children, yet her full role is not known. The family lived a hushed existence despite their wealth, often shunning the public spotlight. They travelled in separate cars for fear of attack, and so that they both would not be killed leaving the children orphaned. They employed Kroll Inc. for their security, which has former members of British Intelligence working for the company. They had several houses, villas, a \\"fleet\\" of yachts, and a \\"squadron\\" of jets and helicopters. As well they had a small wooden house in Chukotka, Russia, where Roman has been the popular governor of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in far northeastern Siberia for some years. Divorce In March 2007, the couple divorced in Russia with an undisclosed settlement, after rumors appeared in the newspapers that a divorce was imminent when Irina was seen visiting high profile prominent British divorce lawyers, including solicitor Raymond Tooth, known as \\"Jaws\\", and also barrister Nicholas Mostyn QC, known as \\"Mr Payout\\", and who has also represented Sir Paul McCartney in his divorce with Heather Mills. One source reports she received a 300 million dollar settlement, including a house in Britain and one in Moscow, a yacht, and an aircraft. In addition to this, Mr. Abramovich would also agree to cover all expenses relating to the five children.

The only station on the Stavne‚ÄìLeangen Line proper, it acts as the southern terminus of the Tr√∏ndelag Commuter Rail. The station opened on 1 December 1988 and is located in the immediate vicinity of the Gl√∏shaugen campus of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, SINTEF and Rosenborg BK's home ground, Lerkendal Stadion. Facilities Lerkendal is the only railway station on the Stavne‚ÄìLeangen Line, a bypass line which was built to allow freight trains to bypass Trondheim Central Station (Trondheim S). The station is located from Trondheim S and from Oslo Central Station. The station is located in the Lerkendal and Gl√∏shaugen neighborhoods, and serves among other institutions the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, SINTEF and Rosenborg BK's home ground Lerkendal Stadion. The station has a waiting shelter, but lacks a ticket vending machines. There is paid parking in the vicinity. Service The station acts as the southern terminus of the Tr√∏ndelag Commuter Rail, operated by SJ Norge. The station is served by two trains arriving and departing in the morning, and two trains departing in the afternoon. Travel time to Trondheim S is 10 minutes and to Steinkjer Station, the northern terminus, is 2 hours and 20 minutes. All services are provided with Class 92 diesel multiple units. History The Stavne‚ÄìLeangen Line opened on 1 December 1957, and was originally only used for freight trains. Lerkendal Station opened on 1 December 1988, and originally was a terminus station. The Tr√∏ndelag Commuter Rail service was introduced from 1 September 1993, and from the same date through trains were operated on the Stavne‚ÄìLeangen Line, stopping at Lerkendal. The station later received a shelter, designed by Linje Arkitekter and similar to other sheds on the commuter line. From 7 January 2001, NSB made several major changes to the commuter rail. A fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim; including extra rush-hour trains from Lerkendal to Stj√∏rdal, giving 23 departures per day in each direction. South of Trondheim, the service was rerouted to terminate at Lerkendal. The station lost most of its service after more trains were redirected to serve Lundamo and Melhus on the main line.

He is a former member of the Escorts, the Swinging Blue Jeans (1966‚Äì69) and the Hollies. In the latter role, he took on the high parts formerly sung by Graham Nash, who had left the band in December 1968. Life and career=Early career/The Escorts Sylvester grew up in Allerton, Liverpool and attended school with future Badfinger guitarist, Joey Molland. At the age of fourteen, Sylvester was employed for a time as a panel beater by George Harrison's brother. The group he co-founded, the Escorts, appeared with the Beatles in the early 1960s. The Escorts recorded their cover of \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\\" on Fontana Records in 1964. A compilation album of the Escorts, From the Blue Angel, was issued on LP and then in 1995, on CD. The Swinging Blue Jeans In 1966, Sylvester began a three-year stint with the Swinging Blue Jeans, replacing guitarist/vocalist Ralph Ellis. The Hollies Sylvester's debut with the Hollies in January 1969 saw him sing on the UK chart hit singles \\"Sorry Suzanne\\" and \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\", plus on the albums Hollies Sing Dylan and Hollies Sing Hollies (both 1969), which debuted Sylvester's songwriting. His first song for the group was \\"Gloria Swansong\\", and he continued to write by himself (\\"Pull Down the Blind\\", \\"Cable Car\\" 1971), with Allan Clarke (\\"Why Didn't You Believe\\", \\"Man Without a Heart\\", \\"Perfect Lady Housewife\\") and as part of Clarke-Hicks-Sylvester. This trio composed most of the Hollies songs on several albums: Confessions of the Mind (1970), Hollies (1974), Another Night (1975), Write On and Russian Roulette (both 1976 ‚Äì although neither of the latter two were issued in the US in their original form) plus A Crazy Steal (1978). Some of Sylvester's work appeared on B-sides on singles including \\"Indian Girl\\" (1972), \\"No More Riders\\" (1974), in addition to singing lead vocals on the Tony Hicks and Kenny Lynch co-written song, \\"Oh Granny\\" (1972). In addition to high harmony vocals, Sylvester also sang a brief lead vocal section on the 1970 UK hit, \\"Gasoline Alley Bred\\" (sung mostly by Allan Clarke). He then took on a greater share of responsibilities during the 1972‚Äì73 period, when Swedish vocalist, Mikael Rickfors, temporarily replaced Clarke. Sylvester sang \\"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress\\" on the Hollies' 1973 US tour and on American television appearances. He later sung a number of lead vocals during this period on Romany (1972). This album included a cover of Judee Sill's \\"Jesus Was a Crossmaker\\". On Out on the Road (1973), Sylvester took lead vocals on several songs including \\"Slow Down, Go Down\\", \\"Pick Up the Pieces\\", and \\"Mr. Heartbreaker\\" (which was co-written with Dean Ford of Marmalade). After a period of discontent, partly over musical policy, Sylvester split with the Hollies in May 1981, in an incident that precipitated the resignation of bassist Bernie Calvert. Solo work In 1974, Sylvester released his eponymous solo album, re-releasing it as I Believe with a slightly revised track listing in 1976. Jimmy Griffin guested harmony vocals on the song \\"Travelin' Boy\\", while Sylvester cut solo versions of his Hollies songs \\"Cable Car\\", \\"Indian Girl\\", \\"Pick Up the Pieces Again\\" and later, a solo version of his 1973 Hollies song \\"I Had a Dream\\", which was added to the CD version of the album. The 1974 single on Polydor (\\"For the Peace of All Mankind\\", an Albert Hammond cover) and a couple of singles in 1976 (\\"I Believe\\", a Stevie Wonder cover, and \\"End of the Line\\") all taken from his solo album failed to chart. In 1978, Sylvester issued the non-album singles \\"Too Bad Lucy Jane\\" and \\"Silver and Gold\\" in the UK, but these also failed to chart. He also earlier had contributed vocals to the Alan Parsons Project's first album, Tales of Mystery and Imagination (1975), singing lead on \\"To One in Paradise\\", and providing background vocals on \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\", behind John Miles. In 1994, a further solo album appeared, I Believe in Love, comprising live versions of both his Hollies and solo recorded songs, plus covers such as \\"It Never Rains in Southern California\\", from a concert recorded on 20 March 1994 in Germany. Griffin & Sylvester In 1982, Sylvester, in collaboration with Jimmy Griffin in Memphis, Tennessee, recorded and released Griffin & Sylvester on Polydor. From this album, \\"Please Come into My Life\\", was released as a single. In the mid-1990s, Sylvester teamed up with Griffin again as the duo 'Griffin & Sylvester', touring the UK and Canada as a part of the 'Soft Rock Cafe'. The friendship and partnership continued, on and off, up to Griffin's death in January 2005. Their 1982 album was re-issued on compact disc with three bonus songs in 1999. Later releases, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame A double album of Sylvester's recordings with the Hollies (mostly Sylvester lead vocal tracks), the Alan Parsons Project, solo, and Griffin & Sylvester entitled The Complete Works: 1969‚Äì1982, was issued in France on Magic Records in 2001. In 2010, as a member of the Hollies, Sylvester was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with Graham Nash, Allan Clarke, Tony Hicks, Bobby Elliott, Bernie Calvert and Eric Haydock.

The 39 half- hour mostly original stories were produced by Sheldon Reynolds and filmed in France by Guild Films, starring Ronald Howard (son of Leslie Howard) as Holmes and H. Marion Crawford as Watson. Archie Duncan appeared in many episodes as Inspector Lestrade (and in a few as other characters). Richard Larke, billed as Kenneth Richards, played Sgt. Wilkins in about fifteen episodes. The series' associate producer, Nicole Milinaire, was one of the first women to attain a senior production role in a television series. The series was the first American television adaptation of Doyle's stories, and the only such version until 2012's Elementary. History Sheldon Reynolds had been successful with his 1951 European-made series Foreign Intrigue (in 1956 he directed a movie with the same title starring Robert Mitchum) and decided a Sherlock Holmes series made in France for the American syndication market might also be successful. Reynolds contacted the Doyle family and began his research into producing a Holmesian television series. Casting Reynolds desired to present the Holmes of A Study in Scarlet. Ronald Howard, then 36, was chosen to portray Sherlock Holmes. Howard shared Reynolds's view of Holmes and his portrayal was much more laid back than the more famous version portrayed by Basil Rathbone. Howard Marion Crawford, credited as H. Marion Crawford, was cast as Watson and it was a role Crawford had long wanted to play. Crawford desired to play Watson as something other than the buffoon as typified by Nigel Bruce's portrayal. Scottish actor Archie Duncan was cast as Inspector Lestrade. Much akin to Dennis Hoey in the Rathbone/Bruce series of films, Duncan's Lestrade was used as comic relief. Besides the three principals (Howard, Crawford and Duncan), a number of actors appeared regularly in the series, including French-born Eugene Deckers, who played no fewer than seven different characters, including both victims and villains. The most famous actor to appear as a guest was Paulette Goddard (\\"The Case of Lady Beryl\\"), but others who would gain fame or near-fame in the future included: Delphine Seyrig (\\"The Mother Hubbard Case\\", \\"The Case of the Singing Violin\\"), Michael Gough (\\"The Case of the Perfect Husband\\"), Dawn Addams, Mary Sinclair, and Natalie Schafer (\\"The Case of the Shy Ballerina\\"). John Buckmaster played character roles in two episodes: \\"The Case of the Haunted Gainsborough\\" and \\"The Case of the Unlucky Gambler\\". Barry Mackay, whose career was nearing its end, also appeared in one episode: \\"The Case of the Laughing Mummy\\". Production Several sets were built in Paris for the street outside 221B Baker Street and the flat itself, both of which were designed by Michael Weight, the same man who built the Festival of Britain 221B exhibit. There were a number of other sets built for a variety of locations and then redressed as necessary (houses, Scotland Yard, shops, parks, offices, etc.) There was very little location work and most of the series was filmed in the studio with many stock shots of carriages on London Bridge and near Big Ben, giving the impression of London. However, on a few occasions, such as \\"The Case of the Eiffel Tower\\", the French filming locations were used. French actors were extensively used in small parts and several affected English accents with varying levels of success. Production was halted each day at exactly 4 o'clock for Duncan to spend fifteen minutes enjoying a special blend of tea he had shipped from London. Although only 39 episodes were syndicated, a second season of 39 episodes was scheduled to begin production in June 1955. Many of the episodes were directed by Steve Previn, the brother of composer Andr√© Previn. Reynolds also produced a second Sherlock Holmes TV series, entitled Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson (1979‚Äì1980). Many of the 1954 TV episodes were remade in the second series. Source material Most of the show's 39 episodes are non-Canonical original adventures, but a few are directly based on Arthur Conan Doyle's stories: \\"The Case of the French Interpreter\\" (based on \\"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\\"), \\"The Case of the Pennsylvania Gun\\" (based on The Valley of Fear), \\"The Case of the Shoeless Engineer\\" (based on \\"The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb\\"), and \\"The Case of the Red-Headed League\\" (based on \\"The Red-Headed League\\"). The first episode, \\"The Case of the Cunningham Heritage,\\" adapts the first section of A Study in Scarlet, in which Holmes and Watson's relationship is established, and develops an original story from there. Several other episodes are identified by Alan Barnes in his book Sherlock Holmes On Screen: The Complete Film and TV History as being loosely inspired by other Doyle tales: \\"The Case of Lady Beryl\\" by \\"The Adventure of the Second Stain,\\" \\"The Case of the Exhumed Client\\" by \\"The Adventure of the Devil's Foot,\\" \\"The Case of the Diamond Tooth\\" by \\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band,\\" \\"The Case of the Winthrop Legend\\" by \\"The Five Orange Pips,\\" \\"The Case of the Violent Suitor\\" by \\"The Adventure of the Illustrious Client,\\" and \\"The Case of the Christmas Pudding\\" by \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\" and \\"The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\\".

DVD & Blu-ray release In 2005, Mill Creek Entertainment released Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Series, a three-disc DVD set featuring all 39 episodes of the series. Also in 2005, Elstree Hill Entertainment released all 39 episodes as The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on ten discs.

On March 9, 2010, Allegro/Pop Flix released \\"Classic TV Sherlock Holmes Collection\\", a four-disc DVD set featuring all 39 episodes of the series. As of 2012, the series has been released on DVD by Mill Creek yet again, this time under the title of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

In the paradox, the warrior Achilles was to race against a tortoise. The track is 100 meters long. Achilles could run at 10 m/s, while the tortoise only 5. The tortoise, with a 10-meter advantage, Zeno argued, would win. Achilles would have to move 10 meters to catch up to the tortoise, but by then, the tortoise would already have moved another five meters. Achilles would then have to move 5 meters, where the tortoise would move 2.5 meters, and so on. Zeno argued that the tortoise would always remain ahead of Achilles.

Delay of game is an action in a sports game in which a player or team deliberately stalls the game, usually with the intention of using the delay to its advantage. In some sports, the delay of game is considered an infraction if it is longer than that permitted according to the game's rules, in which case a penalty can be issued. Some sports that have a delay of game penalty are American football, Canadian football, ice hockey and association football. Gridiron football=American In American football, an offensive team is penalized five yards for delay of game if it fails to put the ball in play by either snap or free kick before the play clock expires. This time limit varies by league, and is often 25 seconds from the time the referee signals the ball ready for play. In the National Football League, it can also be 40 seconds from the end of the previous down, depending on the circumstances at the time. Also, the defensive team can be given the same penalty if, after a play has ended, they fail to quickly yield the ball to officials, prevent a player on the offense from getting up, or kick the ball. Canadian In Canadian football, the term \\"delay of game\\" is used for a different type of foul. On kickoffs, it can be called against the kicking team for failure to put the ball in play within 20 seconds of the referee's signal. At other times in the game, it can be called against the defensive team for interference with the placement of the ball after it is declared in play by the referee. In both cases, the penalty is 10 yards from the previous spot. The foul known as \\"delay of game\\" in American football is called \\"time count\\" in Canada. It is generally identical to the American foul, with two important exceptions. First, Canadian football only allows the offensive team 20 seconds from the referee's signal to put the ball in play, as opposed to the longer periods allowed in the American code. Second, the penalty, which is identical to that in the American code during most of the game, including convert attempts at any time, is dramatically different after the Canadian code's three-minute warning near the end of each half. After the three-minute warning, the base penalty becomes loss of down on first or second down, instead of the regular 5 yards. On third down (the final down that the offensive side has to gain a first down), the penalty becomes 10 yards with the down repeated. The referee also has the right to give possession to the defensive team if he deems repeated time count violations on third down to be deliberate. Association football Any player who the referee adjuges to be delaying the restart of the game to gain an unfair advantage is cautioned and may be shown a yellow card. Common strategies include delaying the taking of a goal kick or free kick, or taking excessive time to leave or enter the field of play during a substitution. Ice hockey A player who shoots the puck directly (that is, without a deflection off the glass or another player or stick) over the glass and out of play from his defensive zone or in the neutral zone, whether intentional or not, is charged with a minor penalty (two minutes). A player who intentionally removes his own goal from its moorings is charged with a minor penalty (two minutes). Also, in leagues utilizing the trapezoid behind the net, if the goaltender plays the puck in the outside corners of the area, he is charged with a delay of game. Bowling In the Professional Bowlers Association tour events, a 25-second shot clock is used for televised events. The clock starts when the bowler picks up his ball on the first ball of a frame, or when it exits the automatic ball return on all other balls. If the bowler fails to release the ball before the clock expires, he is warned on the first offense and charged with a minor penalty ($50 fine) on subsequent offenses in the same tournament. Baseball MLB rule 8.04 requires that, \\"when the bases are unoccupied, the pitcher shall deliver the ball to the batter within 12 seconds after he receives the ball. Each time the pitcher delays the game by violating this rule, the umpire shall call \\"Ball\\". The 12-second timing starts when the pitcher is in possession of the ball and the batter is in the box, alert to the pitcher. The timing stops when the pitcher releases the ball.\\" http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/pitcher_8.jsp This rule, however, is virtually ignored completely. In 2010, the Southeastern Conference began enforcing a 20-second pitch clock when the bases are empty, and the rule was adopted by the NCAA in 2011. A warning is given for the first violation, and subsequent violations by a pitcher result in an automatic ball. If the batter causes the 20-second violation, an automatic strike is assessed. The clock will be visible.http://www.nola.com/tulane/index.ssf/2011/03/ncaa_rules_for_college_basebal.html The pitch clock was used in the Double-A and Triple-A levels of Minor League Baseball beginning in the 2015 season.  Basketball  \\"Delay of game\\" is a violation in basketball. FIBA, NBA and U.S. NCAA have provisions on delays of game, with the first violation being a warning, and the succeeding violations are assessed as technical fouls. FIBA's rules on delaying the game are for deliberately touching the ball after it passes through the basket or by preventing a throw-in from being taken promptly. The NBA's delay of game violations include preventing the ball from being promptly put into play during throw-ins, including a player touching the ball or a defender crossing the boundary line prior to the throw-in, players or other non-players interfering with the ball when it crosses the boundary line, and entering the court with an untucked shirt. The NCAA's rules include provisions on teams that fail to be ready at the start of every quarter or at the end of time outs. Aside from a technical foul, the shot clock is reset to 14 seconds or remains the same, whichever is greater, if the defensive team is the violator; if the offensive team is assessed with the violation, no change in timing will be given. In the NBA, if the delay of game occurred in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime, a technical foul will be assessed if a player crosses the boundary line prior to a throw-in. In the NBA, no ejection of a player or coach can result from a delay of game violation. FIBA and U.S. NCAA, however, will disqualify a player or coach for two technical fouls. In the PBA, the first violation for a delay of game would result in a warning regardless if it happens during the last 2 minutes of the game. The violation is commonly used during throw-ins of close games in order to \\"peek\\" at the play or rotation the opposing team is planning to execute. Quiz bowl In quiz bowl, players buzzing in on a tossup question must say their answer within a short time, usually five seconds. Taking longer than five seconds is called stalling, and typically is treated as if the player gave the wrong answer. This usually implies that the team will be negged (five points taken from the score in NAQT format) and the other team has the opportunity to answer the question while the stalling team is locked out.

This is in contrast to the traditional view whereby knowledge attributions have a binary structure of the form 'S knows that p'. Contrastivism was suggested as an alternative to contextualism. Both are semantic theories that try to explain skepticism using semantic methods. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong proposed in a paper titled \\"A Contrastivist Manifesto\\" a variant of contrastivism that, he argues, differs from contextualism, invariantism, and Schaffer's contrastivism. Ernest Gellner in Words and Things \\"terms derive their meaning from the fact that there are or could be things which fall under them and that there are others which do not.\\" (Emphasis in original.)  The contrast clause  The '...rather than q' part of the knowledge attribution is known as the 'contrast clause'. This is what separates it from traditional binary formulations. Rather than taking the same road as contextualism and saying that the meaning of 'knows' can change with attributor context the contrastivist claims that it is the unspoken contrast clause that changes. This can be used to avoid skeptical problems.

As it is a geometric series with first term and common ratio , its sum is :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{4^n}=\\\\frac {\\\\frac 1 4} {1 - \\\\frac 1 4}=\\\\frac 1 3. Visual demonstrations 3s = 1\\\\. The series lends itself to some particularly simple visual demonstrations because a square and a triangle both divide into four similar pieces, each of which contains the area of the original. In the figure on the left,Nelsen and Alsina p. 74.Ajose and Nelson. p. 230 if the large square is taken to have area 1, then the largest black square has area √ó = . Likewise, the second largest black square has area , and the third largest black square has area . The area taken up by all of the black squares together is therefore , and this is also the area taken up by the gray squares and the white squares. Since these three areas cover the unit square, the figure demonstrates that :3\\\\left(\\\\frac14+\\\\frac{1}{4^2}+\\\\frac{1}{4^3}+\\\\frac{1}{4^4}+\\\\cdots\\\\right) = 1. Archimedes' own illustration, adapted at top,Heath p. 250 was slightly different, being closer to the equation 3s = 1 again :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{3}{4^n}=\\\\frac34+\\\\frac{3}{4^2}+\\\\frac{3}{4^3}+\\\\frac{3}{4^4}+\\\\cdots = 1. See below for details on Archimedes' interpretation. The same geometric strategy also works for triangles, as in the figure on the right:Stein p. 46.Mabry. p. 63 if the large triangle has area 1, then the largest black triangle has area , and so on. The figure as a whole has a self-similarity between the large triangle and its upper sub-triangle. A related construction making the figure similar to all three of its corner pieces produces the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle.Nelson and Alsina p. 56 Proof by Archimedes This curve is a parabola. The dots on the secant line AE are equally spaced. Archimedes showed that the sum of the areas of triangles ABC and CDE is of the area of triangle ACE. He then constructs another layer of four triangles atop those, the sum of whose areas is of the sum of the areas of ABC and CDE, and then another layer of eight triangles atop that, having of that area, and so on. He concluded that the area between the secant line and the curve is the area of triangle ACE. Archimedes encounters the series in his work Quadrature of the Parabola. He is finding the area inside a parabola by the method of exhaustion, and he gets a series of triangles; each stage of the construction adds an area times the area of the previous stage. His desired result is that the total area is times the area of the first stage. To get there, he takes a break from parabolas to introduce an algebraic lemma: > Proposition 23. Given a series of areas , of which A is the greatest, and > each is equal to four times the next in order, thenThis is a quotation from > Heath's English translation (p. 249). :A + B + C + D + \\\\cdots + Z + \\\\frac13 > Z = \\\\frac43 A. Archimedes proves the proposition by first calculating :\\\\begin{array}{rcl} \\\\displaystyle B+C+\\\\cdots+Z+\\\\frac{B}{3}+\\\\frac{C}{3}+\\\\cdots+\\\\frac{Z}{3} & = &\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{4B}{3}+\\\\frac{4C}{3}+\\\\cdots+\\\\frac{4Z}{3} [1em] & = &\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac13(A+B+\\\\cdots+Y). \\\\end{array} On the other hand, :\\\\frac{B}{3}+\\\\frac{C}{3}+\\\\cdots+\\\\frac{Y}{3} = \\\\frac13(B+C+\\\\cdots+Y). Subtracting this equation from the previous equation yields :B+C+\\\\cdots+Z+\\\\frac{Z}{3} = \\\\frac13 A and adding A to both sides gives the desired result.This presentation is a shortened version of Heath p. 250. Today, a more standard phrasing of Archimedes' proposition is that the partial sums of the series are: :1+\\\\frac{1}{4}+\\\\frac{1}{4^2}+\\\\cdots+\\\\frac{1}{4^n}=\\\\frac{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac14\\\\right)^{n+1}}{1-\\\\frac14}. This form can be proved by multiplying both sides by 1 ‚àí and observing that all but the first and the last of the terms on the left-hand side of the equation cancel in pairs. The same strategy works for any finite geometric series. The limit Archimedes' Proposition 24 applies the finite (but indeterminate) sum in Proposition 23 to the area inside a parabola by a double reductio ad absurdum. He does not quiteModern authors differ on how appropriate it is to say that Archimedes summed the infinite series. For example, Shawyer and Watson (p. 3) simply say he did; Swain and Dence say that \\"Archimedes applied an indirect limiting process\\"; and Stein (p. 45) stops short with the finite sums. take the limit of the above partial sums, but in modern calculus this step is easy enough: :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac14\\\\right)^{n+1}}{1-\\\\frac14} = \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\frac14} = \\\\frac43. Since the sum of an infinite series is defined as the limit of its partial sums, :1+\\\\frac14+\\\\frac{1}{4^2}+\\\\frac{1}{4^3}+\\\\cdots = \\\\frac43.

Biography A member of one of Russia's Rurikid families, Pyotr Borisovich Kozlovsky had a short career as a diplomat, was a writer and translator, but is known mainly for his contacts with the numerous literary figures with whom he became acquainted during his extensive and protracted travels in Western Europe. He received an education at home, though this was not taken seriously until the death of an elder brother, and his early intellectual development was promoted much by contact with the cultivated foreigners, mainly French emigrants, who were frequent visitors to his parental home. Kozlovsky became a fluent speaker of French, English, German, and Italian. Enjoying the patronage of Prince Alexander Borisovich Kurakin, in 1801 he entered the Russian diplomatic service in St. Petersburg and in 1802 was appointed interpreter to the Russian mission to the Kingdom of Sardinia. Initially in Rome, where he developed his interest in mathematics and physics, Kozlovsky followed the Sardinian court to Cagliari, when it was forced to flee Rome in 1806. By 1810, he had been promoted to charg√© d'affaires. Recalled to Russia in 1811 and briefly dismissed from the service, in 1812 he was appointed ambassador to Sardinia in Turin, where he remained until 1816. During the brief peace between France and Russia after the signing of the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807, Kozlovsky helped a group of French officers escape English captivity, for which he was awarded the Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur by the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. He was closely involved in the negotiations on the demarcation of the frontiers between Switzerland, France, and the Kingdom of Sardinia and was also a minor member of the Russian delegation to the Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì1815). Kozlowski was familiar with Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand and Hugues Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais, under whose influence secretly converted to Catholicism from Russian Orthodoxy, his religion by birth. In 1816 he married an Italian called Giovanetta Rebora. In 1818, he was appointed ambassador simultaneously to the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg in Stuttgart and the Grand Duchy of Baden in Karlsruhe, but in 1820 a political dispute with the Russian government, caused by his public defence of the beginnings of democratic government in these states, led to his resignation and self-imposed exile, although he continued to receive a salary and remain, theoretically at least, available for service. During this period he turns up for varying lengths of time in Austria (1821‚Äì1822, in Vienna, Graz, Prague, Teplitz), Switzerland, France (1823‚Äì1824 in Paris), Germany (1825-6, in Berlin), the Netherlands and London (from 1829). Even after the new government of Tsar Nicholas I almost halved his salary in 1827, Kozlovsky remained interested in political events, hoping for active employment during the Russo-Turkish war of 1828‚Äì1829, a post as Russian Consul in Hamburg in 1830, and watching the events of the July Revolution of 1830 in France and the Belgian Revolution of the same year. Events in France prompted him to write his Lettres au duc de Broglie sur les prisonniers de Vincennes, in which he pleaded the innocence of former ministers under Charles X. The Belgian revolution prompted him to write Belgium in 1830 in the hope of influencing British policy. The work was not published, however, until 1831, by which time it had been overtaken by events. Kozlovsky only returned to Russia in 1835, having suffered a serious injury in an accident in Poland which left him permanently disabled. In the summer of 1836 he finally returned to diplomatic life as a member of Paskevich's Council for the Kingdom of Poland in Warsaw, so that during the last four years of his life he was travelling between Warsaw and St. Petersburg. He died in Baden-Baden where he had gone to take the waters for health reasons. During the 1810s in Italy Kozlovsky married Giovanetta Rebora from Milan who bore him a son Charles, and in 1817 a daughter, Sophie (Sofka) Koslowska (died in 1878). Sophie was in close contact with the French novelist Honor√© de Balzac, who followed Kozlovsky as the lover of Frances Sarah Lovell (1804‚Äì1883), wife of Count Emilio Guidoboni-Visconti. One sister, Maria Borisovna (1788‚Äì1851), a poet in her own right, was the mother of the composer Alexander Sergeyevich Dargomyzhsky (–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–µ–≤–∏—á –î–∞—Ä–≥–æ–º—ã–∂—Å–∫–∏–π), another, Daria Borisovna, was married to the poet, translator and state councillor Michail Sergeyevich Kaisarov (1780‚Äì1825, –ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–µ–≤–∏—á –ö–∞–π—Å–∞—Ä–æ–≤) Literary life Caricature of Pyotr Borisovich Kozlovsky Even before his exile Kozlovsky had become a well-known figure in polite society and literary circles in Western Europe. In Rome he had met and become a friend of Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand and met Madame de Sta√´l, with whom he continued to correspond after his move to Cagliari. Here he met the future King of France, Louis-Philippe, with whom he is reputed to have discussed Shakespeare on long sea-side walks. While in Cagliari, Kozlovsky also met the Scottish writer John Galt. Galt dedicated his Letters from the Levant to him and also provided him with introductions to Byron and Sir Walter Scott when Kozlovsky passed through London on his way to Turin. On 30 June 1813 he received an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law from the University of Oxford. Princess Lieven waltzing with Prince Kozlovsky Prince Kozlovsky as the \\"lovable rake\\" Kozlovsky first appears in London in early 1812, and seems to have made an immediate impression on English society. In a letter to Lady Morpeth in February 1812, Harriet Countess Granville wrote \\"London swarms with Russians. A fat nephew of the Princess Galitzin, a Prince something, Koslouski I believe, was going to Sardinia, but he has fallen so desperately in love with a beautiful girl, Mrs Tom Sheridan's youngest sister, that he scarcely can ...\\". The novelist Maria Edgeworth wrote of him in a letter to her sister: \\"I know nothing of him but that he is short and fat and looks good-humoured and like two men bound in one. He says he has a great desire to pay me his homage. If he throws himself at my feet he will never be able to get up again.\\" Kozlovsky's prodigious obesity was captured in the caricature by George Cruikshank Longitude and Latitude of St. Petersburgh. A further aspect of Kozlovski's reputation was summed up in an anonymous caricature entitled L'aimable rou√©, published in 1813. Kozlovsky appears to have visited Byron on a number of occasions complaining of the English husband and the restrictions upon their wives, but Byron's plan to return to the Mediterranean with him in the summer of 1813 came to nothing. In subsequent years Kozlovsky had friendly relations with the British King George IV. The Times records on 15 June 1829 that he had been presented to the King at a ball and a year later (The Times, 2 June 1830) he was in London again inquiring after health of the ailing King. During his period as ambassador in Baden, Kozlovsky had become a friend of Karl August Varnhagen von Ense, the German writer who was briefly Prussian ambassador in Karlsruhe, and during his 'exile' Kozlovsky became a constant companion of the poet Heinrich Heine during his stay in August 1826 on the island of Norderney. Kozlovsky's drawing of a steam engine Back in Russia, Kozlovsky became part of the literary circles including Vasily Zhukovsky, Pyotr Vyazemsky, and Alexander Pushkin. In 1836 and 1837, he contributed three popular scientific articles to Pushkin's journal –°–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫ (The Contemporary). The first, in part 1, was –†–∞–∑–±–æ—Ä—ä –ø–∞—Ä–∏–∂—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–∞—Ç–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞–≥–æ –µ–∂–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ 1836 –≥–æ–¥—ä, a review of the Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes for 1836 edited by Fran√ßois Arago; the second, in part 3, was –û –Ω–∞–¥–µ–∂–¥–µ (On Hope), an article on probability theory; the third, in part 6, was –ö—Ä–∞—Ç–∫–æ–µ –Ω–∞—á–µ—Ä—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Ç–µ–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ø–∞—Ä–æ–≤—ã—Ö –º–∞—à–∏–Ω, (A short outline of the theory of steam engines), which was illustrated. Note on transliteration Kozlovsky's name appears in numerous forms, depending on the language it is transliterated into: Kozlovski/y, Koslowski/y, Koslofski/y, Koslouski/y, etc. According to Wilhelm Dorow, the Prince himself seems to have preferred Kosloffsky, one of the less common forms.

However, since the production of the adidas stan smith started, the shoe has been produced in several countries. Among the various countries are Algeria, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, South Korea, Taiwan, USA, and Vietnam.  For tennis  Today, the Adidas Stan Smith is not recommended for tennis players, but the shoe continues to be an iconic and stylish model for sneaker fans in general and for old school and retro tennis shoe fans in particular. To non-tennis fans, Stan Smith is probably better known for the shoe than for his past career as a tennis player.  Sneaker collectors  For some sneaker collectors, the most sought after vintage Adidas Stan Smith are the early versions of the shoe. The ones made in France are considered to be highly valuable.  Sneaker art  Edition \\"Adicolor\\" of Adidas Stan Smith with colors for self-painting For some time, people have been drawing or painting on their sneakers using ink, markers or spray cans. Young people have made this kind of art with various motifs ranging from simple drawings to more complex graffiti paintings. Probably due to its often white color, the Adidas Stan Smith has been used as an object for sneaker art. For example, many artists and design studios hand-paint Stan Smith sneakers and sell them as art.Jamie Starr, \\"Handmade Stan Smiths from Look Down\\", Josh Spear (June 6, 2008), see http://joshspear.com/blog/handmade-stan-smiths-from-look-down/ Retrieved 2013-02-27.\\"hand crafted stan smith's\\", The World's Best Ever (June 9, 2008), see http://www.theworldsbestever.com/2008/06/09/hand-crafted-stan- smiths/ Retrieved 2013-02-27.Brandon Laskowski, \\"Sole Brother: Adidas Stan Smith 'Greens'\\", Paint or Thread (March 17, 2009), see http://www.paintorthread.com/sole-brother-adidas-stan-smith-greens/ Retrieved 2013-02-27.Yohan Quintar, \\"ADIDAS Stan Smith Custom\\", Behance (September 28, 2009), see http://www.behance.net/gallery/ADIDAS-Stan-Smith-Custom/315421 Retrieved 2013-02-27.Meni Tzima, \\"Custom Adidas Stan Smith\\", Behance (February 12, 2010), see http://www.behance.net/gallery/Custom-Adidas-Stan-Smith/420595 Retrieved 2013-02-27. Concerning signed adidas stan smith sneakers, it is possible to find them with Stan Smith's autograph with black marker ink on the white leather upper. In fact, in 1983, Adidas launched the concept of Adicolor, where sneakers were sold along with the tools to customize them. The Adicolor sneakers are all white sneakers specifically created for the Adicolor concept. In 2005, Adidas re-launched Adicolor as a replica of the original from 1983. There have been some Adicolor versions of the Stan Smith. The Sport Goofy, Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Mr Happy, Trimm Dich, Comfort Betty Boop, Comfort Tron, and Velcro Pack versions of the shoe also belong to the Adicolor series.

It was succeeded by the Parliament (), a legislative body formed through nationwide general elections.  Background  After the February Revolution like many ethnic minorities of the shrinking Russian Empire, Azeris also began to form movements aimed at political autonomy from Russia. In the provinces and districts where Azeris constituted considerable population local Muslim National Councils (MNC) were formed. On March 27, 1917 delegates of MNCs gathered to establish the Temporary Executive Committee for the MNCs. Mammad Hasan Hajinski became head of this committee, which also included Mammed Amin Rasulzade, Alimardan Topchubashev, Fatali Khan Khoyski, and other founders of the future Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. After the October Revolution the South Caucasus was separated from mainland Russia, hence the Transcaucasian Sejm formed in Tbilisi proclaimed independence of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. Azerbaijanis formed the largest faction of the same numbering 44 members, and headed by Mammed Amin Rasulzade. These 44 members represented four different political parties and blocks: Musavat and neutral Democrats; the Muslim Socialist Bloc; Ittihad-i Muslimin (or simply Ittihad; Union of Muslims of Russia); and the Muslim Social Democratic Party.  Formation  When the 31 March‚Äì2 April massacres took place in Baku, the Temporary Executive Committee was crushed, its factual leader Alimardan Topchubashev was arrested, and the Azeri intelligentsia was driven out of Baku, Tbilisi became the headquarters of the Azerbaijani National Movement. After the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic fell on 26 May 1918 and its bodies were dissolved, the Azerbaijani faction of the Sejm was renamed to Azerbaijani National Council (NC). It immediately undertook parliamentary functions and proclaimed the foundation of Azerbaijani Democratic Republic on 28 May 1918. On 16 June the Azerbaijani National Council moved to Ganja and declared it Azerbaijan's temporary capital awaiting the fall of the Baku Commune. The Council met with resistance of ultra-nationalists who accused it of being too left-wing; and intolerance of Ottoman Commander Nuru Pasha. It had to be abolished the next day, leaving all power to the Council of Ministers led by Fatali Khan Khoyski.  Second Convocation  After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and the withdrawal of Ottoman forces from Azerbaijan, the power of the ultra-nationalists once backed by Nuru Pasha weakened. This allowed for the Azerbaijani National Council to be re-established and start negotiations with the British occupation forces. The Council was completely abolished after the opening of the Parlaman on 7 December 1918. The Parliament of ADR included the representatives of majority Azerbaijani parties as well as MPs from Armenian, Russian, Jewish, German and Polish minorities of Azerbaijan and representatives of trade unions.

Henricus Batenus (Mechliniensis)In all five languages that this English language Wikipedia inspected, the first name and family name may occur with or without mentioning his place of origin, and remarkably, apart from Dutch and rarely in Latin, the first name and origin can be found without his family name. In his native Dutch language and in German, the latter appears as either Baten or Bate; in French and English the latter spelling clearly prevails. Hence in these languages he is referred to as Hendrik Bate[n] [van Mechelen], Heinrich [Bate[n von Mecheln, Henri [Bate] de Malines, and Henry [Bate] of Mechelen respectively although in particular in English, the French translation of his birthplace is equally common: of Malines (and in German one very rarely finds de Malines and once von Malines). Texts in any language may show his Latinized name Henricus Batenus [Mechliniensis]. (24 March 1246 in Mechelen ‚Äì after 1310 in Tongerloo) was a Flemish philosopher, theologian, astronomer, astrologer, poet, and musician. He was Master of Arts of the University of Paris before 1274. He was a pupil of Thomas Aquinas, he became a canon and cantor of the Cathedral of Saint-Lambert, Li√®ge before 1289. As astronomer, he made astrolabes, and wrote Magistralis compositio astrolabii, dedicated to his friend William of Moerbeke. He drew up astronomical tables: the Tabule Mechlinenses, from around 1285‚Äì1295, and a 1290 work, De erroribus tabularum Alphonsi, which pointed out errors in the Alfonsine tables. While in Rome in 1292, he wrote commentaries on the astrological works of Abraham ibn Ezra and Albumasar. He became tutor to Guy de Hainaut, brother of Count Jean d'Avesnes, for whom he wrote, between 1285 and 1305, a Speculum divinorum et quorundam naturalium (On the Unity of Natural). Around 1309, he retired with the Premonstratensians of Tongerloo, where he ended his days.

He was Chairman of the Conservative Members' Committee in the House of Commons December 1944 ‚Äì June 1945. Baronetcy In 1953, he was created a Baronet by the Queen, of Marchmont in the County of Berwick and Bardrochat in the County of Ayr.Who's Who 1960 p.1896. Upon his death in 1962, his title passed to his eldest son, Sir James. Upon Sir James' death in 1971, his title passed to his brother and Sir John's second son, Sir Robert, as Sir James had three daughters, but no sons. The current holder of the title is his grandson, Sir John Roderick Hugh McEwen, 5th Baronet (born 1965).

The at sea testing began in 1960 after research and development in the late 1950s. The project's test requirement was to prove detection of a submerged submarine at . The experiment, covering a number of years, involved a large active element and a massive receiver array. Artemis receiving field array module as implemented 1963. The receiving array was a field of modules forming a three dimensional array laid from 1961 to 1963 on the slopes of a seamount, the Plantagenet Bank (), off Bermuda. The modules, attached to ten lines of cable, were masts with floats on top to keep them upright. Each module mounted sets of hydrophones. The receiving array terminated at Argus Island, built on the seamount's top, with data processed at the laboratory that was also constructed for the project. The laboratory was then the Bermuda Research Detachment of the Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory. The active source array was to be suspended at to from the former tanker . The 1440-element active array had a one megawatt acoustic output (120 dB) with a center frequency of 400 Hz. Though Artemis failed the final test and resulted in no operational system, it set the agenda for research in ocean acoustics and engineering such systems for the future. Background World War II experience prompted the U.S. Navy to examine the threat of Soviet submarines which had been improved by captured German technology. As a result of the threat being considered high risk sonic detection became a top priority. The Navy approached the National Science Foundation's Committee for Undersea Warfare for advice. Following the recommendations the Navy established a study under Massachusetts Institute of Technology auspices designated Project Hartwell which in 1950 recommended development of a long range passive acoustic detection system. By 13 November 1950 a letter contract had been issued to Western Electric to develop the bottom array system exploiting low frequencies. A test array was laid in the Bahamas off Eleuthera and upon successful tests with a U.S. submarine an order for six such systems was issued in 1952. The he Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS), its name and purpose classified, was given the unclassified name Project Caesar to cover its development and maintenance. In 1956, as the last of the Atlantic SOSUS systems were being installed, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke convened a summer study similar to the Hartwell study designated the Nobska Study coordinated by the Committee on Undersea Warfare. Admiral Burke was particularly concerned with the threat of Soviet nuclear submarines in light of the capabilities of the nuclear submarine had been demonstrated. Much of the study focused on undersea warfare and the need for nuclear anti-submarine submarines but also, in looking at SOSUS, recommended research and development of potential long range, active sonar systems. It also focused on the need to understand the ocean environment. A particular area of investigation was whether an active system could be developed with the power and directivity to exploit ocean zones the passive system being installed might not. With respect to the Navy active sonar project designated Artemis, to run from 1958 to 1963, an understanding of the ocean environment was vital. If the project was to succeed the full efforts of every ocean scientist, technician and laboratory on the Atlantic coast was likely required yet there were only six to seven hundred such people that were qualified. The need to meet that requirement and long term antisubmarine needs of the Navy drove large increases in academic and research budgets for oceanography. As Project Artemis was undergoing tests in the early 1960s SOSUS tracked the first U.S. ballistic missile submarine across the Atlantic in 1961. In June 1962 SOSUS made the first detection and classification of a Soviet diesel submarine, and during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October tracked Soviet Foxtrot-class submarine with correlated sighting by aircraft. On 6 July 1962 the SOSUS array terminating at Barbados demonstrated detection range by identifying a Soviet nuclear submarine transiting off Norway. Project overview A commercial contractor had proposed a long range, active sonar surveillance system to the Navy but a review by Hudson Laboratories showed there were flaws in the basic numbers upon which the proposal looked feasible. Frederick V. (Ted) Hunt of Harvard had proposed that a goal should be a scan of \\"an ocean an hour\\" that was based on the sound speed in seawater so that 3600 seconds equals 3600 miles so that round trip travel time would allow surveillance of an entire ocean from mid ocean. Though the consensus was that contractor's proposed system would not work as conceived there were possibilities something in the field of active sonar could work to meet Hunt's concept. Artemis, Greek goddess of the hunt, was given to the project as a name for that relationship, making it unusual in not being a code word or acronym. Project Artemis experimental and system development effort's goal was to define requirements for a long range, low frequency, active, sonar capable of detecting a submerged submarine at about . The concept was a possible undersea equivalent of the Arctic Distant Early Warning (DEW) radar system. A secondary objective was to define the techniques and problems in fixing such arrays in fixed bottom locations for an operational system. Artemis involved nearly the entire national acoustics community at the time. A Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL)BTL was the research and development principal for technology used in the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS). Western Electric Company, another Bell entity, was the prime contractor for SOSUS. representative initially reviewed plans with a research committee established to continue review of plans and progress. Hudson Laboratories, directed by Dr. Robert Frosch, had been established by the Office of Naval Research to balance Navy laboratories with interests in systems. Hudson Laboratories was the prime contractor for the project with Dr. Frosch as Chief Scientist of Project Artemis. He was followed by Dr. Alan Berman, the laboratory's Associate Director, as Hudson's Director and Chief Scientist of Project Artemis. The Artemis Research Committee chaired by BTL included members from the Marine Physical Laboratory of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Naval Ocean Systems Center, both based in San Diego, Naval Underwater Systems Center, Naval Research Laboratory, Hudson Labs, IBM and others oversaw and coordinated technical matters. Contractors ranged from Western Electric and General Electric companies to small study contracts to General Atronics Corporation. Missiles and Rockets, June 12, 1961, p. 52. The acoustic propagation paths as understood at the time, operating depths of submarines and ray tracing for sound velocity conditions as understood in the Atlantic determined that the sound source depth should be at to with a center frequency of 400 Hz. The transmitting array deployment evolved from a fixed bottom site, a deployment from an anchored or tethered ship with the final decision that it was to be deployed by the converted tanker Mission Capistrano which would be equipped with station keeping capability. Artemis receiver field diagram as implemented 1963. The 10,000 element, three dimensional, receiver array was composed of elements laid in a field as 210 modular masts in ten strings with an additional horizontal line on the slopes of Plantagenet Bank off Bermuda between 1961 and 1963. The Bermuda Research Detachment was established with a building on Tudor Hill adjacent to Naval Facility Bermuda and the Argus Island offshore tower was built for termination of Artemis receiver cables. A test was made, after several years of development, with a submarine at the design range of 1,000 km and fitted with a transponder reacting to the active array's signal for reference. The Artemis system failed the test. Station keeping issues of the active array ship, degradation of the receiving system modules and poorly understood ocean acoustics were involved in the failure. Collapsed Module. No operational system resulted from the effort but it defined the limitations of technology and understanding of underwater acoustics of the time. In particular understanding of scattering and reverberation was shown to be lacking. The Artemis receiving array was expected to demonstrate problems with multipath reflections but experienced considerable failure with floats upon which its configuration relied. Surveys by the submersible Alvin in 1966 and 1967 found multiple float failures with collapsed modules and other damage to standing modules. The major technological limitation was found to be computing capability, particularly speed, that forced use of analog devices for beam steering and signal processing. Results in acoustics formed the basis for extensive ocean acoustics research going forward after the project's termination in the mid 1960s. The project successfully proved techniques for developing and deploying high powered, phased active hydrophone arrays. Passive receiving array Module connection to cable. The receiving array, just as with the source, underwent significant changes from planning to the final test configuration. It was a three dimensional system of hydrophones laid by cable ships on the slope of the Plantagnet Bank seamount. The array cables terminated at Argus Island, the tower erected for the project on the bank. The tower passed the data to the laboratory built and staffed for the project at Tudor Hill, Bermuda. Undersea array The passive receive array field consisted of ten parallel cables with 210 modules composed of masts mounting hydrophones. The cables were laid down the slope of Plantagenet BankPlantagenet Bank is often referred to as Argus Bank. in Bermuda. A 1961 array was to the north east of and parallel to array field string number one and a horizontal string, across the slope, was at right angles to the field at about . The receiving field was approximately on the sound channel axis laid between and .Sources, some recollections, others more specific, vary on depths. The Alvin dive records have clear statements concering maximum dive depth of 6,000 feet and deep end of strings. The strings were laid on the side of the bank using the U.S. Navy large covered lighter YFNB-12, reconfigured with a long overhead boom to handle the masts. Each cable had special takeouts built into it at intervals from which wires to the hydrophones were connected. Each mast was clamped onto the special cable with takeouts. At the upper end of the approximately cable a wire rope was attached and led to an explosively embedded anchor shot into the flat coral top of Plantagenet Bank. Tension of more than 40,000 lb was applied to the wire rope and cable to lay it down the side of the bank in the straightest line possible. At one point all further construction ceased while a stopper was placed on the special cable because most of the connection to the wire rope had broken and the string was being held by a few strands of wire on the double drum winch on YFNB-12. The YFNB-12 was held in place with four Murray and Tregurtha Diesel outboard engines placed on the corners and capable of 360 degree rotation, developing tremendous thrust in any direction.The information is from an anonymous personal recollection moved to Talk:Project Artemis in 2009. A reliable source describing the laying of the Artemis cables has not been found in extensive searches. The account does match the description of the masts and attachments to the cable adding credibility. Surface and shore components The Argus Island tower in 1963 The cables led to Argus Island tower(), located about miles from Bermuda in of water and erected in 1960, from which the signal was conducted to the Naval Underwater Systems Center's Tudor Hill Laboratory located at Tudor Hill, Southampton, Bermuda (). The tower and laboratory had first been connected by cable but was later connected by a microwave link. The laboratory had opened to support Project Artemis and Project Trident in 1961 as the Bermuda Research Detachment under the Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory. That facility was dedicated to acoustic, electromagnetic, environmental and ocean engineering research. Tudor Hill Laboratory (upper right) and Naval Facility Bermuda (large building at left). The laboratory was adjacent to Naval Facility Bermuda which was a classified operational Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) shore terminus. The Tudor Hill Laboratory continued in operation until 30 September 1990 and was the only Atlantic Navy laboratory with access to an operational SOSUS system for research. The facilities were transferred to the Naval Facility with the understanding that NUSC would be provided support should a research need arise.Naval Facility Bermuda itself was closed 30 September 1992. After the project and facilities had been transferred in 1966 with a later transfer of responsibilities to the Naval Research Laboratory in 1969 the Argus Island tower underwent an extensive structural review and repair cost estimates. The acoustic program review also showed the tower at its useful end. As a result the tower was slated for removal. Before demolition the sea cables terminating in the tower were tagged for identification and cut. In May 1976 the tower was toppled by demolitions. The tower's demolition removed a major navigation aid for sport fisherman. Active source array The Artemis steering committee elected to produce a one megawatt acoustic output (120 dB) active source. On 12 May 1958 the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Advisory Group for High Power, Deep Under- water Sound Source met and issued a report on 17 July that resulted in a general specification by The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) issued on 9 September. Five companies responded with widely varying proposals. One conclusion from review of the proposals was the necessity of having a back up of a second transducer design. A fixed bottom site at Eleuthera had been considered with surveys done seeking such a site but the site was changed to Plantagenet Bank which was too far from Bermuda to make power and system cables economical. The deployment, support and operation from a ship then became specified. The problems of power, amplification, instrumentation and other support were engineering problems that were relatively easily managed. The transducers for the array itself and its handling systems required pushing the state-of-the- art into entirely new areas of research and development. Magnetostricthve and electromagnetic transducers were considered for the array itself with low power ceramic transducers to be used for the experimental use in developing the array. On 4 December 1958 Bendix Corporation was contracted through Hudson Laboratories to develop and produce a magnetostricthve transducer and on 28 August 1959 the first Massa transducer was delivered to NRL. Despite redesign the Bendix effort on the magnetorestrictive transducer was unsuccessful, though the last model was retained as backup, and that effort was terminated on 8 June 1960 with replacement by Massa. The final design then settled on a large, 1440-transducer element \\"billboard\\" array of transducers. Individual elements passed tests but demonstrated problems when assembled into modules and the array itself due to mutual interference. An element with slightly lower radiation resistance would absorb power from higher power elements and fail to be followed by the next lower power element in a cascading failure that particularly damaged elements away from the array's edges. The Naval Research Laboratory had both a theoretical study and an active experimental program seeking a solution. The experimental study involved modules of the elements in test configurations using the to help determine the final array configuration. Ultimately transducers were replaced by electromechanical elements termed \\"shaker boxes\\" to reduce those failures. The array could not attain full power due to nonuniform displacement across the face of array at higher power. The problem of inter element coupling and cascading failure was never fully solved. USNS Mission Capistrano undergoing conversion showing Project ARTEMIS active source array well. The World War II tanker Mission Capistrano was selected and modified for deploying the array. The T2 tanker hull had sufficient space and structural integrity to allow installing array power and control systems and creating a large center well through which the array could be housed, lowered and operated. On 28 August 1958 specifications for conversion were completed with a contract for conversion with Avondale Marine Ways let on 7 January 1960. The ship engaged in array tests and was further modified until 3 November 1962 when the array was removed at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and the ship released for other work until re- installation the next March. The mutual element interference problems resulted in redesign and re engineering that continued past the Bermuda experimental period to the end of the formal Artemis experiments. For example the array was tested in the Northwest Providence Channel, Bahamas, from 19 July through 3 August 1964 after the array elements' connections had been changed to all parallel rather than combined series-parallel connections to reduce the interference problems. The array was tested at frequencies from 350 to 500 cycles per second in steps. The array was then put through an endurance run at 350, 415, 430, and 450 cycles per second for two hours at power levels of 120, 200, 300 and 450 kilowatts. The maximum power could not be attained and element deflections continued to be a problem. Array description for original experiment Source transducer array on USNS Mission Capistrano (mid-1960s). The source array was high, wide, and thick at bottom. Combined with a support structure for the array itself the source assembly was high with a weight of . The face of the array was tilted upward at eleven degrees so as to insonify the desired ocean layers from the operation depth finally selected. The transducer elements were cubes of weighing assembled in 72 element modules six elements wide by twelve elements high. Those modules were then assembled on the array in five module components stacked in four horizontal rows. The optimal center frequency of 400 Hz proved in tests to be optimized with the actual modules at approximately 385 Hz and 405 Hz. The array assembly also had electrical equipment required to make the electrical connection between array transducers and the transmission cable and for measurement and control functions that were housed in tanks at the bottom of the array assembly. At the top of the structure were four hydrophones in three coordinate axes that provided array orientation relative to acoustic positioning hydrophones. The array development and tests continued after the main experiment at Bermuda in an effort to resolve issues with high powered active sources. Ship modifications Equipment arrangement on USNS Mission Capistrano. Original plans envisioned a platform that could be capable of handling the source array as a mobile unit for tests and then both fix the array to the bottom and then provide power and control of the array when moored on Plantagenet Bank. The requirements included the capability to moor the ship above the fixed site, lower a foundation and affix it to the bottom using existing ocean drilling and cementing methods. The most significant modification to Mission Capistrano was the system for operating the source array at the required depth of through a large center well. The well was wide by long References differ on dimensions. The general historical discussion of the project (Erskine) has the well dimensions as 40 by 60 feet. The dimensions stated in formal, contemporary technical reports (McClinton) are used. with bottom closure when the array was raised by means of a rolling door on the long axis. The door was designed to prevent surging in the well while the ship was underway but did not seal the opening. In stowed position the array was held by supports with stabilizers to prevent motion of the array while stowed. When deployed the array was supported by wire rope attached to cable machinery located in forward holds running over winches located on deck fore and aft of the well and supersturcture. The supporting cables and the electrical cables ran over special roller devices designed to dampen ship motion that would be transferred to the deployed array. A number of power options, including nuclear, were considered early in the program. The array, as evolved for the main experiment, was powered by a gas turbine generating plant capable of producing three phase, 60 cycle current and rated at 8,000 kilowatts at 4160 volts located aft of the ship's array well. Controls protected the gas turbine from rapid load variance from 800 kw base to 8,000 full and to keep voltage variation at less than 2% and frequency variation at less than 1%. The ship's main propulsion turbine generator could also provide 6890 kilowatts at 3500 volts through a 3500/4160 Volt transformer. Forward of the array well was an amplifier room with the controls, switching mechanisms, transformers, instrumentation and electronic amplifiers to drive the transducers in the array. The gas turbine power plant was removed after construction of a fixed bottom site for the source array was eliminated and the element interaction issues forced reduced array power so that the ship's steam turbine provided sufficient power. All the modifications made for construction and installation of the array at a bottom site, drilling equipment, foundation construction support and the helicopter platform were removed. For successful tests the position of the source array in relation to the receiving array had to be accurately known and maintained. The specified orientation of the source also had to be maintained. A deep ocean moor with the ship maintaining heading within the moor was originally planned. To maintain ship's heading within the moor a 500-shaft horsepower electric driven controllable reversible-pitch propeller was installed in a transverse tunnel located in the forward peak tank as far forward as possible. The manufacturer rated the system's static thrust at 13,200 pounds. A system with a minimum of 10,000 pounds thrust was determined from information based on smooth water operation of a 500 500 horsepower, 13,600 pounds thrust installed in the similar sized vessel J.R. Sensibar. That information indicated such a truster could twist the ship and maintain heading in moderate weather within a few degrees of required heading. Tests at dockside showed the actual thruster installation could provide 11,250 pounds static thrust.{ In actual use at sea in mild sea conditions the thruster could twist the ship at eighteen degrees per minute. In wind, swell with waves the thruster could twist the ship to any heading and maintain that within one degree. The mooring system was used thirty-eight times over twenty- seven months but was not satisfactory. It was slow, cumbersome and anchors sometimes failed to hold. Assistance of tugs was found to be fairly successful but tugs were not always available. As a result the movement of the ship introduced doppler distortions that were unpredictable to the active array. A dynamic positioning system of eight large outboard engines and station keeping on a bottom fixed transducer was planned. The project was terminated before the advanced ship station keeping and positioning system was implemented. Feasibility of permanent installation The results of the experiments showed that the high power source was not at a developmental stage to develop the desired power. The large masts and unwieldy components of the receiving array, though reasonably successful and use continued beyond the scheduled experiment, were subject to failure. The experiment showed that knowledge of ocean acoustics required considerable advancement. The tests indicated that such a system was possible but considerable development would be required. Projected expenses were massive. Robert Frosch noted the Navy wanted the knowledge obtained but was not going to build systems. Gordon Hamilton observed funding such a system \\"would have been horrendous.\\" Those factors combined with the fact that SOSUS was more than effective in detecting submarines resulted in it remaining an experiment. Political context In 1959 the Soviet Union was deploying its first generation Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, R-7 Semyorka. They were capable of delivering its payload at around 8,800 km, with an accuracy (CEP) of around 5 km. A single nuclear warhead was carried with a nominal yield of 3 megatons of TNT. However, they were very new and turned out to be very unreliable. First SOSUS sensorsK-19, the first nuclear-powered Russian boat, was commissioned on 30 April 1961. The military at that time considered the single greatest security threat to the USA the possibility of a submarine-delivered nuclear warhead placed near a major American city. Artemis was considered part of an underwater Defense Early Warning system. However, it was discovered that the Soviet boats were particularly noisy. Rapid advances in computer technology and the development of signal processing algorithms, such as the Fast Fourier transform, quickly gave the West the superior military position using multiple passive SOSUS arrays. In 1961, SOSUS tracked USS George Washington from the United States to the United Kingdom. The next year SOSUS detected and tracked the first Soviet Diesel submarine. The Artemis active systems were eventually retired, since the passive systems proved adequate to detecting submarines that threatened the American coast. Largely because of the spy ring operated by John Anthony Walker in 1968, and the development of the submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, the need to send ballistic submarines directly to the American coast diminished. The Soviet Union began to rely more on a Bastion, whereby the latest generation of SSBN was deployed only in well-protected nearby waters. A mobile surveillance capability, called SURTASS, was developed in the mid-1970s. This system passed Operational Evaluation (OPEVAL) in 1980 and the ships began to be deployed. By 1985 Soviet naval exercises in the North Sea were using as many as a 100 vessels, including attack submarines. Chief of Naval Operations enacted the Urgent Anti-Submarine Research Program (CUARP), whose centerpiece was to activate the SURTASS fleet with a low- frequency system, and to develop tactics for such a system. The mobile system was considerably smaller than the Artemis transducer array, weighing roughly one-sixth as much. With the diminished threat of the Atlantic SSBN, vessels were equipped with Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System and deployed in the Pacific. New generations of Attack submarines and Ballistic missile submarines were being deployed by several countries. The low frequency active system is currently being deployed on the USNS Impeccable.

The term is most commonly associated with team sports, for example Association Football (Soccer), Curling, or Basketball. However, it can be applied to groups of individuals representing a country where regular play is done by individuals, and individual scores are aggregated to a get a team result. Examples of this association are found in Artistic Gymnastics, Archery, or Figure Skating. National teams often compete at various levels and age groups, and have a number of different selection criteria based on national and their respective federstions' rules. National teams are not always composed of the best available individual players. National teams, like other sporting teams, are often grouped by sex, age or other criteria. The most prestigious national teams are often the senior men's and women's teams. However, they may not be the most popular or successful. In most cases, a national sports team represents a single sovereign state, though there are some exceptions to the rule. In several sports, the British Isles divides along internal boundaries: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are represented by separate national teams, while in the Olympic Games they combine to form a Great Britain team. The Ireland national rugby union team represents the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in rugby union, and all-island teams are fielded in a number of other sports. Some Olympic teams represent dependent territories, including Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Cook Islands. The Iroquois Nationals (men) and Haudenosaunee Nationals (women) lacrosse teams of the First Nations Lacrosse Association are the only teams representing any group of Indigenous people of the Americas that plays in an international level.https://www.encyclopedia.com/sports/news- wires-white-papers-and-books/professional-team-sports Popularity and notability The popularity and notability of a national team depend on a number of factors: Popularity and participation Popularity of a national team also depends on the popularity of the sport in that country. In some countries a particular sport is very popular and may be a national sport but it does not always mean their national team is the most popular. Also, the national team's own league may be popular but the international competition it competes in is not. For example, the Papua New Guinea national rugby league team (PNGL) is extremely popular because the sport is popular in the country, even though the highest competition it competes in - the Rugby League World Cup - is not. In this case, there are numerous reasons for the lack of popularity of the World cup in Papua New Guinea. One is that the country is relatively small, population 8 million, and the expense of travel around the world to follow their team is too great for most. Another reason is that, because 75% of the professionals in the PNGL are not national citizens and therefore only eligible to play for their home country's national team, the Papua New Guinea National Team is not as successful internationally. Therefore, because the national league is inner territorial and more accessible to residents of Papua New Guinea and because spectators feel more invested and closer to their national town clubs, explains why a countrys' national sport's National Team may not be the most popular team in said area. The exact opposite may be true as well where the national team is more popular than its respective league(s). For example, the Korean National Handball League is not extremely popular because handball is not a popular sport in Korea. But the South Korean National Team is popular because it internationally wins medals in the Olympics or World Cup Events. =Demographics= A particular sport in a country may be more popular among certain groups. For example, a women's team may be more popular than a men's team if there is a greater participation in the sport. Popularity of the competition The popularity of the international competition that a team participates in has the biggest influence on the popularity of national sports team. There is a certain amount of prestige which is associated with competing on the \\"world stage\\". Competitions with the most teams involved offer the most international competition and are often most popular. The most popular multi- sport international competitions that include team sports include the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games are relatively open for participation. Other competitions that are specific to sports, such as the FIFA World Cup (Association football), Rugby World Cup (rugby union) and Cricket World Cup (cricket) allow many countries to qualify. For instance, the popularity of the Socceroos is heightened during the FIFA World Cup simply due to participation in a global event. However, how even the competition is also matters. Even if there are a large number of participants, if a handful of teams dominate or if many of the teams are from countries where the sport lack sufficient depth to field a quality side, then the overall competition will not be taken seriously. Competitiveness or success of a team The popularity of a national team can also be due to a team being successful even if the sport itself is not popular in a country. Strength of domestic competition In many countries, the national team is the highest level of play available and as a result, it is often most popular with fans and spectators from that country. In other countries, domestic competitions may be more competitive and offer a higher standard of play and reward. Individual selection and participation Depending on the sport, nation, and era in question, membership on the national team may be earned through individual play (as is the case for an Olympic athletics team or a Davis Cup team), players may be selected by a managers and coaches appointed by a national sport association, or a team may have to win a national championship in order to receive the right to represent their nation (as in the World Curling Championships). Eligibility Various rules are used to determine who is eligible to play for which national team. =Association football= Under FIFA regulations, a player primarily qualifies for a national team by \\"holding a permanent nationality that is not dependent on residence in a certain country\\"‚Äîi.e., being a passport-carrying citizen of said country. If a player's single nationality enables him or her to play for more than one FIFA member, any of the following will be sufficient to establish eligibility for a specific association under that nationality: # Birth \\"on the territory governed by the relevant association.\\" # The birth of a biological parent or grandparent in said territory. # Two years of continuous residence in said territory at the time of his or her first appearance. However, FIFA allows associations that share a common nationality to make an agreement among themselves, subject to FIFA approval, by which the residency criterion is deleted completely or amended to require a longer time limit. The most notable example of this situation is the United Kingdom, which has four national associations on its territory (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales). Players become permanently tied to a national association, with one exception to be outlined below, once they play in \\"an official competition of any category or any type of football\\". This includes any competition for national teams governed by FIFA, including qualifying matches for said competitions; international friendlies cannot tie players to a country under any circumstances. Players who have more than one nationality, regardless of the method of acquisition, have slightly different eligibility requirements from those who have a single nationality, whether or not it is shared by multiple associations. In addition to holding the relevant nationality, any of the following will qualify a player to appear for said country: # Birth in that country. # Birth of a biological parent or grandparent in that country. # Five years of residence in that country after turning age 18. This last rule is intended to prevent associations from naturalising players who lack birth or familial ties in that country, and immediately fielding them in international matches. FIFA will issue waivers to this last requirement if an association can show to FIFA's satisfaction that the player had significant ties to that country prior to naturalisation. A recent example of such a waiver is that of Gedion Zelalem, a German-born player of Ethiopian descent who currently represents the U.S. at under-23 level. He emigrated with his father to the U.S. at age 9 in 2006, and left the country at age 16 to join Arsenal's youth academy. In 2014, he automatically became a U.S. citizen outside the normal naturalisation process when his father became a U.S. citizen, and the United States Soccer Federation applied for a waiver of the adult residency requirement, citing Zelalem's extended childhood residence in the U.S. He was approved to play for the U.S. several months later. Separate from the above rules, a player who holds multiple nationalities may petition FIFA for a one-time change of nationality if he or she has never appeared in an official senior international match for any country, and holds the nationality of the second country prior to appearing for said country. The aforementioned Zelalem case falls within the scope of these rules, since he had played for Germany at youth level. =Basketball= FIBA's national team eligibility rules are broadly similar to those of FIFA. Holding nationality is mandatory (but not sufficient) for eligibility to represent a country. Players with multiple nationalities may choose to play for of one of those countries at any age by making a written request to FIBA. However, if the player has yet to make a choice and one of those countries formally calls the player to international duty after he or she reaches age 18, that player is required to make a choice at that time. As in association football, playing in an international friendly cannot tie a player to any country; only participation in an official FIBA competition is sufficient for this purpose. Unlike association football, FIBA does not have a \\"grandparent rule\\" for most players. The method by which a player obtains citizenship is irrelevant to national team eligibility, as long as it has been legally acquired. The only use of the grandparent rule is to determine a player's eligibility to represent the national team of a country's dependent territory, with two notable examples being those of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, both US insular areas with their own national federations, and whose native-born residents are US citizens by birth. While the method by which a player becomes a citizen does not affect his or her eligibility for a national team, it can affect the player's ability to participate in a given FIBA competition. FIBA mandates that in official competitions, no national team can have more than one player on its roster who acquired citizenship by any means after reaching age 16. This also applies to individuals who had the right to a second nationality at birth (such as individuals born in Northern Ireland, who are generally born with UK citizenship but also have the right to citizenship in the Republic of Ireland from birth), but did not exercise that right until age 16 or later. =Cricket= The eligibility rules of the International Cricket Council provide three qualifying criteria for prospective national team players, all linked to the country governed by a specific national federation:Article 2.1, The International Cricket Council Player Eligibility Regulations, 7 May 2018. Downloadable from the ICC here. # Birth. # Nationality, defined as holding a valid passport. # Three years of permanent residence. Players can only be tied to a given national team by being named to that country's squad, either in the first XI or as a substitute (playing or non-playing), in an official ICC match‚Äîdefined as a Test, ODI, or Twenty20 match that involves a national federation's senior side. Playing at under-19 level, or for a senior developmental team, does not bind an individual to that country.Article 2.2, The International Cricket Council Player Eligibility Regulations, 7 May 2018. Unlike many sports, which make changes of nationality difficult or impossible, cricket allows players to represent more than one country during their careers. However, a player is limited to representing two countries in his or her lifetime, and a three-year stand-down period is enforced‚Äîunless the player who has previously represented an ICC associate member is seeking to play for an ICC full member (i.e., a Test-playing nation), in which case there is no stand-down period. The player may represent his or her original country after representing the second country, but only after the full three-year stand-down period. =Rugby union= Unlike the situation in association football and basketball, in which holding nationality in a country is a requirement for representing that country, or cricket, in which nationality is one of several means by which a player can qualify for a national team, eligibility regulations in rugby union do not mention nationality at all. Players can qualify for a given country in one of four ways: # Birth in the country. # Having a parent or grandparent born in that country. Note that unlike FIFA, which defines \\"parent\\" and \\"grandparent\\" to include only blood relations, World Rugby replaces blood relations with adoptive relations if the player has been legally adopted under the laws of the relevant country. This replacement also applies if the player was not adopted, but one or both of the birth parents had been adopted. # Residing in the country for a set period of time prior to their first appearance for that country. Currently, the required period is three years, but it will change to five years effective 31 December 2020. This means that any player who moved to a new country after 31 December 2017, and cannot qualify by another method, is subject to the new five-year rule. # Completion of 10 years of cumulative residency in the country, regardless of whether any of the other criteria have been met. This particular criterion went into effect in May 2017. This does not prevent a national union from requiring that its representative players hold that country's nationality. For example, since December 2016, the French Rugby Federation has required French nationality as a precondition for national team selection, with players who had represented France before the policy change exempt from said requirement. Normally, if a player has ever played for one national team then he or she may not play for the team of a different nation at same or at the next-higher level of seniority. However, the addition of rugby sevens to the Olympics created a loophole due to the IOC's different eligibility criteria. Players who have been \\"captured\\" by one country but hold the passport of another country can make a one-time change of allegiance to the second country under the following conditions: * The player has not represented the capturing country for three years at the time of his or her first appearance for the second country. Special rules in place only for the 2016 Olympic qualifying process shortened this period to 18 months. * The player represents his or her new country in four Olympic qualifying events. This includes events in the World Rugby Sevens Series for men and World Rugby Women's Sevens Series in seasons immediately preceding the Summer Olympics, which double as Olympic qualifiers, plus regional Olympic qualifying tournaments. As for the concept of \\"capturing\\"‚Äîi.e., being tied to a specific country‚Äîthe criteria have evolved over the years. Under current World Rugby regulations, a player is captured once he or she plays for one of three specific teams: # A union's 15-a-side senior national team. # A union's \\"next senior\\" 15-a-side national team. Each union may, but is not required to, designate one of its teams as the \\"next senior\\" team. This side is usually designated as an \\"A\\" national team, though a number of nations have special brand names for their \\"next senior\\" side, such as Argentina XV, England Saxons, Ireland Wolfhounds, or Junior All Blacks (New Zealand). Notably, many unions have not designated a \\"next senior\\" women's team. Prior to 1 January 2018, a union could designate its under-20 national side as its \\"next senior\\" team, but this is no longer allowed. # A union's senior national sevens team. However, no player can be captured by playing on a senior sevens team before turning 18 under any circumstances, and cannot be captured in this manner prior to age 20 unless the player participates in the Olympics or Rugby World Cup Sevens after turning 18. Note that unlike association football or basketball, players can be captured by appearing in international friendlies, such as the traditional mid-year and end-of-year Tests. However, capture only occurs when the opponent is also one of the above-mentioned sides. This can sometimes cause apparently counterintuitive results. For example, Mike Haley has represented England twice‚Äîfirst for England Saxons against South Africa A in 2016, and then for a non-capped England XV against the Barbarians in 2017. However, neither match tied him to England, and he remains eligible for selection to Ireland, for which he qualifies by ancestry. Even though the 2016 match involved two national \\"A\\" sides, it did not qualify to capture Haley (or any other player on either team who had not previously been captured) because at the time, South Africa's designated \\"next senior\\" side was its U-20 national team. As for the 2017 match, WR classifies the Barbarians as a club team, putting them outside the scope of this regulation. Various controversies have involved the participation of players whose eligibility has been challenged. One famous example was Grannygate. More recently, questions have been raised about the eligibility of two players who participated in the European qualifying process for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, one for Belgium and the other for Romania. Professionalism vs. amateurism In some national teams, representatives play for the love of their sport and country. However, in others, individual players are paid to represent their country. In some cases, players are either deliberately excluded or choose not to represent their national team on the basis of not being remunerated. This can affect the relative performance of a team. In other cases, players may be contracted to a club, at home or abroad. As a result, their primary loyalty may be to their club rather than their country, especially if the competition that the national team is playing in does not offer the same prestige. Controversy Communist countries were accused of having an advantage by having state-sponsored \\"full-time amateurs\\" because of their economic system. Their Olympic athletes were given everything they needed to live and train, but were not technically paid to do it because it was sponsored by the state. With the decline and fall of the Soviet Union and its influence, Western countries demanded to allow professionals to compete at the Olympics and the current status quo came into order.

It is irregular in shape, having numerous peninsulas and bays, and is approximately six miles long in a southwest to northeast direction and with a maximum width of about two miles (3 km). Lac Courte Oreilles is in size with a maximum depth of and a shoreline of .Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Website lake map (see external link below) The lake has a small inlet stream (Grindstone Creek) that enters on the northeast shore of the lake and flows from Grindstone Lake, a short distance away to the north. An outlet on the southeast shore of the lake leads through a very short passage to Little Lac Courte Oreilles, then via the Couderay River to the Chippewa River, and ultimately to the Mississippi River at Lake Pepin. Lac Courte Oreilles is located approximately eight and one-half miles southeast of the city of Hayward, the primary commercial and retail center of the area, and is one of three large natural lakes (Lac Courte Oreilles, Grindstone Lake, and Round Lake) located to the south and east of the city. There is a small unincorporated residential community on the north side of the lake commonly referred to as Northwoods (or North Woods) Beach. The eastern part of the lake is located in the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation. The shore of the lake is principally occupied by seasonal lake cabins and homes. The lake has an abundance of northern pike, muskie, walleye, bass and other fish, and is a popular fishing destination. Lac Courte Oreilles is now a popular resort area drawing cabin owners and visitors from the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Milwaukee and Chicago metropolitan areas. Origin of name The name Lac Courte Oreilles is shared by the nearby Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation. In the Ojibwe language, the lake is called Odaawaa-zaaga'iganiing, meaning \\"Ottawa Lake,\\"Ojibwe Dictionary. Freelanguages; Retrieved 2007-04-14 after another of the Anishinaabe peoples. It was referred to as such (or as \\"Ottowaw Lake\\") in early English-language descriptions of the area.See, for example, John Parker (ed.). Journals of Jonathan Carver. St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1976, p. 127.Philip P. Mason (ed.). Schoolcraft's Expedition to Lake Itasca. East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1958, pp. 6, 87, 341. French fur trappers, the earliest European explorers in the area, named it Lac Courte Oreilles after the Ottawa Anishinaabe peoples living in the area. The French believed they cut off the edges of their ear lobes, so referred to them as the Courte Oreilles, or \\"Short Ears.\\" An alternative explanation is that some tribes in the region had a practice of distending their earlobes by earrings or other ornaments, and the local people's ears looked short in contrast. But the Indians of the Lac Courte Oreilles area did not practice that custom and had naturally shaped \\"short\\" ears.See Philip P. Mason (ed.). Schoolcraft's Expedition to Lake Itasca. East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1958, p 98, footnote 8. History Prior to European exploration, the area of Lac Courte Oreilles was inhabited by the Ojibwa Indians. The first known visit by Europeans to the area was around 1660. Pierre-Esprit Radisson and M√©dard des Groseilliers travelled from Chequamegon Bay on Lake Superior southward through the area in 1659 and stayed for a period at an Ojibwe village on a lake that has been identified as Lac Courte Oreilles.The Explorations of Pierre Esprit Radisson; ed. Arthur T. Adams; Ross & Haines, Inc.; Minneapolis; 1961, p. 128-130. The editor indicates that Lac Courte Oreilles was identified as the location of the Indian village by Father Chrysostome Verwyst in Parkman Club Papers (No. 11), vol. II, pp. 1-24. Adams argues that the visit occurred in 1661 rather than 1659, the year normally ascribed to the visit. The English Jonathan Carver passed through the area in 1767 while traveling north from the Mississippi River up the Chippewa River. He reported staying at the Indian village on Lac Courte Oreilles (he referred to it as Ottowaw Lakes) from June 22 through 29, 1767. He described the village as being on either side of a channel between two lakes, which he referred to as the Ottowaw Lakes. He next travelled to the St. Croix River (by way of Grindstone Lake, Windigo Lake, the Namekagon Portage, and the Namekagon River) and thence northward to Lake Superior.John Parker (ed.). Journals of Jonathan Carver. St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1976, pp. 127-129. In describing their visit to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian village, Carver and another member of the expedition, James Stanley Goddard, said that they were the first white people to have visited the area.John Parker (ed.). Journals of Jonathan Carver. St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1976, pp. 128, 129, 190. They likely did not know about the travels of Radisson and Groseilliers to the area about 1660, more than one hundred years before, and were not likely to have been reading French sources, if available. The 19th-century United States Indian agent in this area, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, visited the lake and Ottawa village in 1831. He described the trip from the Namekagon River to Lac Courte Oreilles by way of the Namekagon Portage, Windigo Lake and Grindstone Lake.Schoolcraft's Expedition to Lake Itasca; ed. Philip P. Mason; Michigan State University Press; East Lansing; 1958, p. 6. Schoolcraft visited the Indian village on Lac Courte Oreilles and described it as being located at the outlet of the lake.Schoolcraft's Expedition (1958), p. 115. From Carver's and Schoolcraft's descriptions, the Ottawa village appeared to have been located on either side of the channel between Lac Courte Oreilles and Little Lac Courte Oreilles. Lac Courte Oreilles and this village were well known to traders and explorers of the time, and the village was one of the larger Indian settlements in the area. Schoolcraft listed its population as 504 persons in his report based on his 1832 exploration to the sources of the Mississippi River. This meant that it was one of the largest Indian settlements in the region.Schoolcraft's Expedition (1958), ed. Mason, p. 160 The village's importance was likely associated with the strategic site of Lac Courte Oreilles on the route between the Chippewa River watershed and the St. Croix River watershed. The latter watershed was reached from Lac Courte Oreilles by travelling north and west through Grindstone Lake, Windigo Lake, and over the Namekagon Portage to the Namekagon River in the St. Croix River watershed.

Early and family life His father James Caldwell (1724-1804) and his wife Elizabeth were Irish gentry whose name reflected Castle Caldwell established in Ulster Plantation a century earlier. They had emigrated with nine children to Maryland in 1769 and then moved to what became Wheeling in what was then Virginia in 1772. During their sea voyage, Elizabeth Caldwell gave birth to Samuel Caldwell, and in Baltimore, Maryland she bore this James Caldwell Jr., then Susana Caldwell (b. 1772), Alexander Caldwell(1774-1838), and Joseph Caldwell (b. 1777). James Caldwell the elder became a Virginia justice of the peace and militia leader in the developing rural area, and his son/James's brother John Caldwell helped erect Fort Henry to defend the new settlement against Native American raiders.https://archive.org/stream/westvirginiaitsp02mill/westvirginiaitsp02mill_djvu.txt Career In 1799, before his father's death, James Caldwell moved a few miles westward on the National Road to St. Clairsville, Ohio. He purchased the first lot in the village, and opened a store in 1801. He became wealthy and was the first president of the Belmont Bank of St. Clairsville. When Belmont County was organized in 1801, Northwest Territory Governor Arthur St. Clair named him Clerk of Courts. He was a Belmont county delegate to the 1802 Ohio Constitutional Convention. He represented Belmont County in the Ohio Senate from 1809 to 1813. Caldwell ran for his first term in Congress in 1812 as a captain in the militia supporting the administration and the War of 1812 against Federalist candidate Bezaleel Wells. All six seats in Ohio were won by Democratic-Republicans, but Caldwell was the only one who supported the Tammany wing of the party. He was elected to the 13th and 14th United States Congresses (March 4, 1813 to March 3, 1817). After he retired from Congress, he resumed business in St. Clairsville. He served as one of Ohio's Presidential elector in 1820 for James Monroe, and in 1824 for Henry Clay. After his wife's death, Caldwell moved to Wheeling, which his father had helped establish, several brothers lived, and where his son Alfred Caldwell practiced law and was becoming a prominent politician. James Caldwell Jr. lived and ultimately died at Beemer's Tavern, essentially a residential hotel. During his final years, he was president of Wheeling's Merchants and Mechanics Bank, which later merged into the National Exchange Bank.https://archive.org/stream/westvirginiaitsp02mill/westvirginiaitsp02mill_djvu.txt Death and legacy James Caldwell died in Wheeling on May 5, 1838, and his remains were returned to St. Clairsville for burial in the Episcopal Cemetery.Findagrave NO. 8083162 His brother Alexander, who had become the U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Virginia, died the following year. His son Alfred was twice elected mayor of Wheeling in the 1850s, despite being a prominent abolitionist, and saw the village become a city. Alfred Caldwell also served in the Virginia Senate, helped establish the state of West Virginia after the American Civil War, and served as U.S. Consul to the Kingdom of Hawaii.

The route runs from DE 1 in the town of Dewey Beach to another intersection with DE 1 west of the city of Rehoboth Beach. The route provides access to Rehoboth Beach from DE 1, heading north before turning to the west. DE 1A follows King Charles Avenue, Bayard Avenue, 2nd Street (southbound), Christian Street (northbound), and Rehoboth Avenue. What is now DE 1A was originally a part of DE 14 between 1936 and 1942. The road was designated DE 14A by 1966. In the 1970s, DE 1A was designated along DE 14A for a few years before DE 14A was decommissioned in favor of DE 1A. Between 2002 and 2006, a streetscape project revitalized the Rehoboth Avenue portion of the route and a roundabout was added at the entrance to Rehoboth Beach. Route description DE 1A northbound on Bayard Avenue in Rehoboth Beach DE 1A begins at an intersection with DE 1 in the town of Dewey Beach, heading north on two-lane undivided King Charles Avenue. The road passes through residential areas before it leaves Dewey Beach, becoming Silver Lake Drive and curving northwest to run to the south of Silver Lake. The route bends north and crosses the lake, where it enters the city of Rehoboth Beach. Here, the name changes to Bayard Avenue and it becomes a divided highway. DE 1A becomes undivided again and comes to an intersection with Christian Street. At this point, northbound DE 1A turns northwest onto Christian Street to reach Rehoboth Avenue while southbound DE 1A follows 2nd Street north to Rehoboth Avenue; Rehoboth Avenue serves as the main street of Rehoboth Beach that leads east to the Rehoboth Beach Boardwalk along the Atlantic Ocean. DE 1A southbound on Rehoboth Avenue in Rehoboth Beach The highway heads west along four-lane divided Rehoboth Avenue and runs past businesses, passing south of the Rehoboth Beach Convention Center. The road intersects DE 1B, which connects to DE 1, before it comes to a roundabout at Grove Street/Columbia Avenue, with Columbia Avenue heading northeast to provide access to the town of Henlopen Acres, North Shores, and the Gordons Pond section of Cape Henlopen State Park. Following this, the route narrows into a two-lane undivided road and passes south of the Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Center and the Rehoboth Beach Museum before crossing the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal on a drawbridge and leaving Rehoboth Beach. DE 1A continues west past homes and businesses and ends at another intersection with DE 1\\\\. This intersection has no direct access from DE 1A to southbound DE 1\\\\. Motorists from DE 1A wanting access to southbound DE 1 must follow the Rehoboth Avenue Extension service road parallel to DE 1 that provides access to DE 1 at the Sea Blossom Boulevard intersection. DE 1A has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 25,168 vehicles just west of Rehoboth Beach to a low of 3,437 vehicles on the Rehoboth Avenue Extension frontage road at the northern terminus at DE 1. None of DE 1A is part of the National Highway System. History What is now DE 1A was originally designated as part of DE 14 by 1936. By 1942, DE 14 was realigned to bypass Rehoboth Beach to the southwest. DE 14A was designated onto the former alignment of DE 14 through Rehoboth Beach by 1966. By 1974, DE 14A became concurrent with DE 1A. The DE 14A designation was dropped in 1977 and the road was solely designated DE 1A. In October 2002, work began on a streetscape project to revitalize Rehoboth Avenue. The project provided new sidewalks and plants and placed utility lines underground. A roundabout opened at Grove Street and Columbia Avenue in May 2004. The roundabout features a replica of the Cape Henlopen Light and serves as a gateway to Rehoboth Beach. When the roundabout first opened, there were issues of drivers not yielding properly. As a result, improved yield signage was installed. The streetscape project was completed in June 2006, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony held. The project cost $36 million; the Delaware Department of Transportation paid $16.3 million, the city of Rehoboth Beach provided $10 million, and the Federal Highway Administration provided $7.75 million. U.S. Senators Tom Carper and Joe Biden helped secure federal funds for the project.

Born in Helsinki, she started her career in Finland and later moved to Brooklyn at the age of 17 together with her then manager Tomi Ervi. Janita has released nine albums in her native Finland, some of which reached the top forty chart in Finland. Her third US album, Didn't You My Dear?, was released worldwide in March 2015 on ECR Music Group. Early life and career Janita Maria was born 28 December 1978 in Helsinki, Finland. She learned to sing before she could talk, and began playing electric piano at age three. She started writing her own songs on piano at age four, and often performed and danced with the encouragement of family and her mother. While she was never formally trained in singing, she seriously studied both classical piano and ballet. She was exposed to diverse music at a young age, often singing along to soul music, hip hop, and R&B.; At age 13 she met her long-term songwriting partner and musical collaborator Tomi Ervi (aka Tomi Sachary).http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1319&artikel;=4473930 She began recording and performing pop vocals with Ervi. Janita signed to the label Reel Art at age 13, who released her first single, \\"Jos J√§√§t\\", in 1992. Her full debut album, Oma Planeetta, followed in 1993. A second album, S√§vyj√§, was released in 1994 on Reel Art. As a teenager she soon broke into the mainstream in Finland, and became a fixture on radio, television, and on the touring and commercial circuits. According to The Daily Telegraph, as a teenager she was \\"Finland's biggest popstar\\". She also won two Finnish Emma Awards. Her third album, Believer, was released on Dig It Records in 1997, peaking at number fourteen on the Finnish Albums Chart. Dig It also released her single \\"Ready or Not\\" around that time. Adult career=Janita (1998) Janita moved to Brooklyn, New York City at age 17. She was quickly signed to Sony Music Entertainment's 550 Music at age 18. Janita, which included new music and the track \\"Getting Over\\" from Believer, was released in Australia and Japan in 1998, and also released in Finland. The album was never officially released in the United States by Sony as a result of label infighting. I'll Be Fine (2001) Janita chose to leave Sony and independently released her fifth album I'll Be Fine in 2001, which featured both her songwriting and vocals. This served as Janita's American debut album, and the song \\"I'll Be Fine\\" was released as a single. A Finnish version of the album, \\"Tunteita,\\" reached number thirty-seven on the Finnish chart. According to SoulTracks, \\"I'll Be Fine\\" was released to generally positive reviews for its \\"brand of smooth, jazz-infused vocal music,\\" and also showed her growing talent as a songwriter. Seasons of Life (2005) Janita's sixth studio album Seasons of Life was released in Finland in 2005 by Ofir Music and Reel Art, reaching number thirty-one on the Finnish Albums Chart. The album was released in the United States (her second release there) on 16 May 2006 by Lightyear Entertainment and in Japan on 21 September 2006 by Victor Entertainment, including a cover of Depeche Mode's \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" as a bonus track, which peaked at number thirty-six on Billboards Jazz Songs on 12 August 2006. A 12\\" vinyl containing three remixed tracks from the album was released in 2006 on Lightyear. SoulTracks review stated that: \\"Janita's wispy, pretty voice works well with the restrained, jazzy arrangements, creating a tasty, very listenable collection. Most notable are the album's compositions (generally written by Janita and Sachary), which are the best of her career.\\" Haunted (2010) On 27 July 2010, Janita released her seventh studio album Haunted worldwide on Blake Morgan's independent label Engine Company Records (now ECR Music Group). According to Janita, interacting with Meshell Ndegeocello partially convinced her to try a new alternative direction with the album. \\"She exposed me to music I hadn't explored before. I loved it. Totally devoured it. I moved into Keane, Tom Waits, Radiohead, Smashing Pumpkins, Hole, and PJ Harvey. A natural progression.\\" For the album she worked with co-producer Jamie Siegel, whose credits include the Smashing Pumpkins and Joss Stone. The album was first mastered and edited at Masterdisk in New York for the Finnish release, then later remastered and resequenced by Morgan. SonicScoop wrote, \\"If the sonic purity and emotional intensity of Haunted sounds like it's coming from somewhere very real, it's because it is. Hearts broke in the making, as Janita split with her longtime collaborator/life partner Tomi Sachary even as he served as co-producer on the album. Along the way, Janita [...] crafted a collection of songs that leaves her adult contemporary reputation‚Äîfoisted on her by years of chart-chasing advice‚Äîin the dust.\\" Didn't You, My Dear? (2015) Janita's latest album, Didn't You, My Dear?, was released worldwide 31 March 2015, on ECR Music Group. It had its official album release concert on 26 March at New York's Webster Hall.http://www.BroadwayWorld.com With her new material Janita is drawing comparisons to Blonde Redhead and Patti Smith among others.http://audiofuzz.com/read/review-janita-didnt-you-my-dear/ Blake Morgan, ECR Music Group founder-owner, produced Didn‚Äôt You, My Dear? at his Manhattan studio. Aside from retouching and releasing Janita's 2010 release Haunted, this new album is the first the two have made from scratch together.OneTrackMine.com Of Didn't You, My Dear?, Baeblemusic.com states: \\"Janita's voice is hauntingly beautiful and delightfully rich. Her music is as multi-faceted as it is intelligent, incorporating flecks of R&B;, jazz, indie folk and alternative. And more than anything, it's extremely digestible without sacrificing depth, a very rare characteristic.\\" She continues to perform music from her albums live, and her performances have been described by critics as \\"alternately sultry and savage\\". Personal life Janita married her long-term boyfriend and her producer Tomi Ervi in July 2004 but filed for divorce in Helsinki District Court 4 years later in 2008.http://www.iltalehti.fi/viihde/200809278337215_vi.shtml Tomi Ervi is 17 years older than Janita and they met when Janita was only 13 years old and Mr. Ervi 30. They moved to Brooklyn, New York when Janita was 17. Janita still resides in Brooklyn and no longer has relations with Tomi Ervi. The Daily Telegraph noted that as of 2011, \\"her personal style is verging on androgynous; she cut off her long blonde hair and wears men‚Äôs suits on stage‚Äîa reaction to the over sexualised image promoted by her earlier managers, perhaps.\\" Activism Janita became an American citizen in 2013, and since early 2014 has represented the #IRespectMusic campaign, the grassroots movement that has been galvanizing musicians on their right to get paid for airplay. She has joined the movement's leader Blake Morgan in pushing for legislation to make crucial change in this area. (ref. One Track Mine, Broadway World) Janita has traveled back and forth to Washington DC to meet with Congressmen and women including Representatives Marsha Blackburn, Jerrold Nadler, Doug Collins and Ted Deutch, as well as representatives of the National Music Publishers' Association and the Recording Industry Association of America. On 13 April 2015 the movement's hard work was rewarded with a bill introduced, proposing federal legislation that broadcast companies be forced to begin paying artists and record labels for songs played on terrestrial radio.

The brand evolved from the Classic Leather, the Workout, the Ex-O-Fit, the Newport Classic and the Freestyle. Reebok Classic also includes Retro Running, Retro Basketball, InstaPump Fury and contemporary styles. Product history=Franchise 5 In 1982, the Freestyle, the first athletic shoe designed for women, was introduced. The shoe popularized the aerobic exercise movement, encouraged women to participate in sports and began the acceptance of athletic footwear as street and casual wear. In 1983, Reebok launched the Classic Leather, a running shoe. It gained popularity as casual wear because of its simple design in comparison to the technical running footwear designs that followed the Classic Leather's release. A print advertisement showing a couple on a motorcycle with the tag line \\"You've Arrived\\" was created for the shoe. That year, the Newport Classic (NPC) and Ex-O-Fit were launched. The Ex-O-Fit was similar to the Freestyle, but designed for men. In 1985, the Workout was launched as a cross-training shoe. The shoe's simple look made it popular as casual wear. Retro Running Reebok Classic established the Retro Running line to re-introduce popular shoe styles from the past. The GL 6000 was a lightweight running and training shoe created to provide maximum stability. The shoe was first released in 1986 and has been re-released to honor the shoe's history and illustrate its timeless appeal. In 1990, the Ventilator, a lightweight flexible running shoe, was launched. The Ventilator's versatility made the shoe popular. Reebok Classic re-released the Ventilator \\"Tonal Ballistic\\" and \\"Heritage\\" limited edition packs in 2014. The DMX Run was launched in 1997. The shoe debuted Reebok's DMX technology, a system in which air runs through connected pods and releases energy. DMX was later used in Allen Iverson's second shoe. Reebok Classic re- released the shoe for the first time in October 2012. Retro Basketball The Reebok Pump was introduced as a basketball shoe in 1989. It was the first shoe to have an internal inflation mechanism designed to provide a customized fit. Over a four-year period the shoe sold over 20 million pairs worldwide. In 1992, the Shaq Attaq was released during the NBA season. It was Shaquille O'Neal's first signature shoe and the first official shoe for a Reebok athlete. The shoe gained popularity because it was featured on basketball cards, video games, Pepsi commercials and movies. The retro version of the Shaq Attaq was released in April 2013. The Reebok Kamikaze, Shawn Kemp‚Äôs signature line, was launched in 1995. That year, the Shaqnosis was launched. The shoe was worn by Will Smith in Men in Black. In 1996, the Reebok Question Mid, Allen Iverson's signature shoe, was launched. The shoe became popular because it was clean and wearable. Iverson's fan-base also attributed to the Reebok Question Mid's popularity. InstaPump Fury The InstaPump Fury was released in 1994. The shoe was lace-less and featured Reebok's pump technology, a reduced midsole, Hexalite cushioning and a fully synthetic upper. That year, Steven Tyler wore the shoe during a performance at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards. The shoe was inducted into the Design Museum of London. It has received numerous re-releases and new colorways. In pop culture Alicia Keys, Kendrick Lamar, 50 Cent, Jay-Z, Travi$ Scott, Mike Skinner (musician) and Kid Ink have collaborated with Reebok Classic.

Known as the Central Hubei Operation, East and West of Hsiang River, in Japan it is called the Êº¢Ê∞¥‰ΩúÊà¶ (Han River Operation). The battle lasted from 25 to 30 November 1940. After the battle of Zaoyang-Yichang in the summer of 1940, the Japanese controlled I-chang and Sha-shih. The Chinese controlled the area east and west of the Hsiang River. Their lines extended from the southwest of Yuan-an via Ching-men, north of Chung-hsiang, and the foothills of Ta-hung Shan, to the area northwest of Sui Hsien astride both banks of the Hsiang River. The Wu-tang Mountains were on the right and the Tung-po Mountains on the left. In coordination with the guerrilla forces in the southeast, the Chinese repeatedly struck at the Japanese forces that had penetrated to I-chang. As a result, the Chinese believed that the Japanese forces at I-chang and Sha-shih found their flanks exposed and in a difficult position. To relieve themselves of this threat they launched an offensive against the Chinese forces in late November. Japanese sources say the purpose was to probe to find the location of the Army of Tang Enbo. If that was their purpose they were to be disappointed.  Preparations  During early November the Japanese made preparations for their attack, repairing and constructing roads, bridges, defense works and airfields. Rations, ammunition, metal and rubber boats, were stored in the vicinity of Chung-hsiang. They also brought in additional troops into the area west of the Xiang River, estimated at five regiments bringing their strength to the equivalent of three Divisions. To the east at the Japanese increased their strength to a full division (3rd Division) at Sui Hsien along the Hsiang - Hua highway. They further brought in supporting units of tanks and artillery in these areas. On 23 November the Japanese 11th Army preparations were complete and their unit deployed in their attack positions in five major forces: * Kayashima Force at Tang-yang composed of the 18th Independent Mixed Brigade and elements of the 4th Division under Lt. Gen Taka Kayashima commander of the 18th Independent Mixed Brigade. * Murakami Force, at Chingmen, the 39th Division under its commander Lt. Gen Keisaku Murakami. * Hirabayashi Force, at Chung-hsiang, composed of a portion of the 17th Division and Kurahashi Detachment (the detached 60th Infantry Regiment from 15th Division) under the commander of 17th Division, Lt-General Morito Hirabayashi. * Kitano Force north of Ching-shan in the vicinity of modern Shuanghe, composed of a portion of the 4th Division and the Kususe Armored force (7th and 13th Tank Regiments) under Lt. Gen Kenzo Kitano commander of the 4th Division. * Teshima Force at Sui Hsien composed of the 3rd Division under its commander Lt. General Fusataro Teshima. Li Zongren recognizing the Japanese build up foretold an attack, had his 5th War Area alerted. He ordered the River West Army Army Group (30th and 77th Corps), Right Army Group (44th and 67th Corps) and Central Army Group (41st and 45th Corps) to checking the coming Japanese advance by counterattacks on the flanks of their advancing columns when the opportunity presented itself.  Order of Battle Central Hubei Operation (25‚Äì30 November 1940)  The Offensive  On the morning of 25 November, the Japanese began their attack in several columns. On the Western Front between the Hsiang River and Tang-yang, over 1,000 Japanese from the Kayashima Force, advanced northward from Tang-yang toward Hengtien, and broke through the gap between the positions of the 179th and 37th Divisions of the Chinese 77th Corps at Yang-chi-ai. Over 3,000 Japanese from Murakami Force from Ching-men broke through the positions of the 27th Division of the Chinese 30th Corps toward Yen-chih-miao. Meanwhile, the Japanese Kitano Force moving northwest from Chu-chia-fu to Tung-lin-ling and divided into several columns to drive north deep into the Chinese position at Liang-shui-ching, Hsia-chia-tzu, and northeast toward Kuai-huo-pu. At night, the River West Army Group swung reserves into blocking positions from Heng- tien to Yen-chih-miao and Kuai-huo-pu. On 26 November, the Murakami Force reached Hsien-chu. On 27 November the Murakami Force attacked Liu-hou-chi and the two columns of Kitano Force attacked Li-chia-tang, both fighting bitterly for a day against the Chinese 30th Corps reserve, the 30th Division under Liu Chen-shan, who halted their advance. At dusk the Chinese 30th Corps launched a counterattack in force with elements of the 31st and 27th Divisions striking the Japanese rear areas. Unable to withstand this attack the Japanese retreated toward Ching-men and Chung-hsiang, with the Chinese in pursuit. Meanwhile, east of the Hsiang River on the Ching-Chung Highway Front the Japanese Hirabayashi Force massed more than 3,000 men in an attack on Changshoudien and Wang-chia-tien attempting to encircle the Chang-chia-chi - Wu-lung-kuan line. On 26 November, the Japanese reinforced to 5,000 men, advanced a force east to San-li-kang, while the main force attacked Pien-chai, Wang-chia-ho and Yu-nan-men. Heavy fighting lasted until darkness ended the clash in a stalemate. On 27 November the Chinese 44th Corps counterattacked from Wang-chia-ho. Its converging attack with the main force of the 67th Corps towards the northwest, caused heavy casualties to the Japanese. On 25 November the Japanese Teshima Force on the Sui Hsien Front launched a violent attack with a column of 2,000 men from Liang-chui-kou on the Chinese 123rd Division at Lishan. Two additional columns of more than 1000 men each advanced west toward Ho-yuan-tien and Ching-ming-pu. By darkness, the Japanese reinforced. On 26 November the Japanese fought a bitter battle with the Chinese 124th and 127th Divisions at Chin-chi Shan and Ching-ming-pu. Another Japanese force of 700‚Äì800 men moved from Hsi-ho via Lang-ho-tien to Tang-chia-fan. Having been attacked by the 41st Corps, the Japanese in the vicinity of Ching-ming-pu linked up with their force at Chin-chi Shan and moved to the vicinity of Ho- yuantien on 27 November. At night, the Japanese force near Tang-chia-fan reached the vicinity of Huan-tan Chen to confront the Chinese 125th Division. Since its objective was to break the Japanese force 5th War Area command directed its forces to keep secure key localities and take advantage of mountainous terrain to conduct ambushes to stop the invaders. Heavy fighting lasted until 28 November when the Japanese retreated. Chinese forces west of the Hsiang River continued their pursuit. The Japanese force in front of the Chinese Right Army Group was routed on the same day, retreating by several routes. Subjected to a converging attack by Chinese forces of the Central Army Group, the Japanese forces facing them in the area of Ho-yuan-tien, and Huan- tan Chen, fell back to high ground in the vicinity of Ho-yuan-tien and Tang- chia-fan and were encircled by the Chinese. The Japanese pulled a further 1,500‚Äì1600 infantry and cavalry from Sui Hsien and Yingshan via Shang-shih- tien and Sha-tien for a turning movement against the Chinese to retrieve the situation. Once again, the Japanese were ambushed. Under cover of airplanes and armour, the Japanese retreated toward Sui Hsien and Hsi-ho, as Chinese forces attacked along the line from Chun-chuan to Anchu, Li-shan, and Kao- cheng. On 30 November, the Chinese Army Groups recovered their original positions.  Results  The Japanese suffered over 5,000 dead and 7,000‚Äì8,000 wounded. Some 1,000 Japanese bodies were left in the field according to Chinese sources. The Japanese hoped to have a victory at the time of the establishment of the Wang Ching-wei regime so as to dampen Chinese morale. The effect was the opposite of what was hoped.
