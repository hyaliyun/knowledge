It is named in contrast to the Eastern Desert which extends east from the Nile to Red Sea. The Western Desert is mostly rocky desert, though an area of sandy desert, known as the Great Sand Sea, lies to the west against the Libyan border. The desert covers an area of which is two-thirds of the land area of the country. Its highest elevation is in the Gilf Kebir plateau to the far south-west of the country, on the Egypt-Sudan-Libya border. The Western Desert is barren and uninhabited save for a chain of oases which extend in an arc from Siwa, in the north-west, to Kharga in the south. It has been the scene of conflict in modern times, particularly during the Second World War. Geography Rock formations in the White Desert Quartz-rich sand from the Western Desert near Sakkara, Egypt. Administratively the Western Desert is divided between various governorates; in the north and west, the Matrouh Governorate administers the area from the Mediterranean south to approx 27*40' N latitude, and the New Valley Governorate from there to the Sudan border, while in the east parts of the Western Desert lie in the Giza, Fayyum, Beni Suef, and Minya Governorates. The region is described by one writer as \\"a plateau standing on average some above sea level, barren, rubble- and boulder-strewn, dark brown in colour, occasionally dotted with scrub, and, at first sight, flat\\".Pitt p13 He also states that little of the area conforms to \\"the romantic view... the Hollywood scenery of wind-formed dunes with occasional oases fringed with palm\\" (although such areas do exist in the Sand Sea where dunes are sculpted into fantastic shapes); the area is also the location of a series of oases created where the land dips sufficiently to meet the aquifer. These lie in an arc from Siwa in the north-west near the Libyan border, to Bahariya, Farafra, Dakhla, then Kharga in the south. East of Siwa lies the Qattara Depression, a low- lying area dotted with salt marsh and extending west to east and north to south. Further to the east, near the Nile, another depression gives rise to the Fayyum Oasis, a heavily populated area separate from the main Nile valley. To the south, beyond the Bahariya oasis lies the Black Desert, an area of black volcanic hills and dolerite deposits. Beyond this, north of Farafra, lies the White Desert, an area of wind-sculpted chalk rock formations, which give the area its name. To the south of Kharga the plateau rises towards the Gilf Kebir, an upland region lying astride the Egypt-Sudan border and home to pre-historic sites such as the Cave of Swimmers. In the south-west, near the point where the borders of Libya, Sudan and Egypt meet, is an area of desert glass, thought to have been formed by a meteorite strike at Kebira, over the border in Libya. The Great Sand Sea is a roughly lung-shaped area of sandy desert lying astride the border with Libya, inland from the Mediterranean. The sea is divided by a long peninsula of rocky desert along the border, leaving the eastern lobe in Egypt and the western in Libya, where it is called the Calanshio desert. On the Egyptian side it extends from a point south of Siwa for into the interior, to a point north of the Jebel Uweinat.Firestone pp320-367Sattin pp267-293Thompson, Folkard pp252-263 Name The Western Desert was known historically as the \\"Libyan Desert\\", taking its name from Ancient Libya, which lay between the Nile and Cyrenaica. With the formation of the state of Libya, the term \\"Western Desert\\" has come to describe that part of the Sahara in Egypt. To the Ancient Greeks, the term Libya described the whole Saharan littoral west of the Nile to the Atlas mountains. During Roman times the term Libya was limited to Cyrenaica and the region between there and Egypt, which were organized as the provinces of Libya Superior and Libya Inferior. The term Libyan Desert then applied to the area to the south of these. This became a misnomer during colonial times when Cyrenaica and the land to the west was organized as the Italian colony of Libya in 1911, and the term Western Desert to describe the area within Egypt became more common. Playfair described the Western Desert of 1940 as being wide (i.e. from the Nile to the Libyan border) and wide (i.e. from the Mediterranean to the latitude of Siwa oasis), while the region to the south was referred to as the Inner Desert.Playfair pp115-117 However, during the Second World War the term Western Desert came to apply not only to the coastal desert of Egypt but to the area fought over in Libya also, ranging beyond the Egypt-Libya border to Gazala, Cyrenaica and even El Agheila. The contemporary use of the term refers to the entire desert in Egypt west of the Nile. Western Desert at Encyclopædia BritannicaWestern Desert at countrystudies.us (Library of Congress) History Rock carvings at Gilf Kebir. In pre-historic times the Western desert is thought to have been a semi-arid grassland, home to savannah animals and hunter-gatherers; evidence of abundant wildlife and surface water can be found in the cave paintings of the Gilf Kebir. It is thought over-grazing and climate change led to desertification and the current geography. Even after this, the oases remained inhabited, and the Antiquities Museum at Kharga has artifacts dating back to the time before the early Egyptian kingdoms. In ancient times the area was regarded as being under the jurisdiction of the kingdom of Egypt, and Egyptian remains can be seen in all the oases. In 525 BC an expedition by the Persian king Cambyses II was lost in the desert searching for the Oracle of Ammon, at Siwa. In 333 the Oracle of Ammon was visited by Alexander the Great, where he was confirmed as the son of Amun. With the absorption of the kingdom of Egypt into the Roman Empire the desert region was organized into the province of Libya Inferior, while Cyrenaica became Libya Superior. In time the region came under the jurisdiction of the Byzantines, their successors, the Arabs, Mamluks and Turks. In 1882 the kingdom of Egypt became a British protectorate, and in 1912 the territory to the east was claimed by Italy as the colony of Libya. Tank engagement during the Western Desert Campaign. In the 20th century the Western Desert became an arena of conflict; during the First World War it was the location of the Senussi Campaign against the British and Italians. The 1930s saw an upsurge of exploration and mapping expeditions by British Army officers, such as Ralph Bagnold and Pat Clayton, laying the basis for war-time operations by such forces as the Long Range Desert Group. This period was also marked by the search for Zerzura, a mythical oasis in the deep desert. During the Second World War, from June 1940 until November 1942 it was the location of the Western Desert Campaign fought between the Axis powers (Italy and Germany) and the Western Allies (principally Britain, and the Commonwealth, a total of 15 nations) until the Allied victory in November 1942. In modern times the Egyptian government has been keen to develop the area economically, encouraging settlement of the oasis areas, and surveying for mineral wealth, particularly oil.

The report of the tribunal placed the blame for the disaster on the National Coal Board (NCB), naming nine of its staff as having some degree of responsibility. The disaster On 21 October 1966 a colliery spoil tip on a hill above the Welsh village of Aberfan near Merthyr Tydfil collapsed, killing 116 children and 28 adults. More than 1.4 million cubic feet (40,000 cu metres) of debris covered a section of the village in minutes. The classrooms at Pantglas Junior School were immediately inundated; young children and teachers died from impact or suffocation. Establishment of the tribunal On 26 October 1966, after resolutions in both Houses of Parliament, the Secretary of State for Wales appointed a tribunal to inquire into the causes of and circumstances relating to the Aberfan disaster. It was chaired by the respected Welsh judge and Privy Councillor Lord Justice Edmund Davies, who was born two miles from Aberfan and had attended Mountain Ash Grammar School. Before the tribunal began, the Attorney General imposed restrictions on speculation in the media about the causes of the disaster. Aberfan Colliery spoil tramway before the disaster, with spoil heaps at top left. The red brick building at mid left is Pantglas County Secondary School. The hearings The tribunal sat for 76 days – the longest inquiry of its type in British history up to that time – interviewing 136 witnesses, examining 300 exhibits and hearing 2,500,000 words of testimony, which ranged from the history of mining in the area to the region's geological conditions. The tribunal report thought \\"much of the time of the Tribunal could have been saved if ... the National Coal Board had not stubbornly resisted every attempt to lay the blame where it so clearly must rest — at their door.\\" Not until day 49 had an NCB witness conceded that tip safety arrangements had been inadequate; not until day 65 had one conceded that (contrary to the assertions of Lord Robens, the Chairman of the NCB) the instability of Tip 7 could clearly have been foreseen, and that this had been known within the NCB \\"even before the formal sittings of the inquiry had started\\" (italicised in original).Tribunal report paras 189-197 Robens was then invited to testify (effectively to explain NCB failure to publicly correct his statements once they were known to be erroneous). He said that he had known before the inquiry started that the tip instability was foreseeable, but during cross-examination he \\"gave inconsistent answers\\": invited by NCB counsel to disregard Robens' evidence the tribunal did so.Tribunal report paras 198-206 The tribunal retired on 28 April 1967 to consider its verdict, publishing its report on 3 August. The report The report of the tribunal stated in its introduction: > \\"... our strong and unanimous view is that the Aberfan disaster could and > should have been prevented. ... the Report which follows tells not of > wickedness but of ignorance, ineptitude and a failure in communications. > Ignorance on the part of those charged at all levels with the siting, > control and daily management of tips; bungling ineptitude on the part of > those who had the duty of supervising and directing them; and failure on the > part of those having knowledge of the factors which affect tip safety to > communicate that knowledge and to see that it was applied.\\"Tribunal report > (para 18) The tribunal's findings were that: > I. Blame for the disaster rests upon the National Coal Board. This blame is > shared (though in varying degrees) among the National Coal Board > headquarters, the South Western Divisional Board, and certain individuals. > II. There was a total absence of tipping policy and this was the basic cause > of the disaster.detailed exploration of this finding is at paras 177-188 of > the tribunal report In this respect, however, the National Coal Board were > following in the footsteps of their predecessors. They were not guided > either by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Mines and Quarries or by > legislation. III. There is no legislation dealing with the safety of tips in > force in this or any country, except in part of West Germany and in South > Africa. IV. The legal liability of the National Coal Board to pay > compensation for the personal injuries (fatal or otherwise) and damage to > property is incontestable and uncontested. The specific cause of the collapse was a build-up of water in the pile; when a small rotational slip occurred, the disturbance caused the saturated, fine material of the tip to liquefy (thixotropy) and flow down the mountain. Although it was estimated that tailings constituted about 10% of the tip at the time of the disaster, the inquiry concluded that they were not a contributory factor in the fatal slide: \\"Owing to the geological and geographical features and the size of the tip, the expert evidence is that there would have been a major slide even had no tailings been placed on it.\\"para 124 of Tribunal report: In 1958, the tip had been sited on a known stream (as shown on Ordnance Survey maps) and had previously suffered several minor slips. Its instability was known both to colliery management and to tip workers, but very little was done about it. The tips were the responsibility of mechanical engineers who had only a layman's understanding of tip stability issues. The attention of colliery management and engineers (whom the tribunal noted to be generally devoted and over-worked) was directed elsewhere: The disregard of the NCB and the colliery staff for the tip's unstable geological conditions and its failure to act after previous smaller slides were found to have been major factors that contributed to the catastrophe. The tribunal found that the tips had never been surveyed, and up to the time of the landslide were continuously being added to in a chaotic and unplanned manner. Repeated warnings about the tip's dangerous condition had been ignored; even after representations from Merthyr Borough Council, NCB civil engineers (who should have realised the dangerous state of the tip had they seen it) had not been involved: \\"if there had been a proper investigation with a view to allaying the fears and resolving the doubts, the effect on the course of events must, in our opinion, have been dramatic and decisive.\\" The tribunal also described as 'an aspect which we have not overlooked' the argument of Geoffrey Howe on behalf of the colliery managers that tailings had played an important role in the mismanagement of the tip: \\"they were believed to be the significant hazard, and with their stoppage, with their discontinuance on the site, it was believed that the hazard had been removed\\".para 114 of Tribunal report: No blame lay with Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council or the National Union of Mineworkers; they had assumed that the NCB was acting on the basis of sound technical advice.Tribunal report: Council at paras 250-251 (), NUM at para 256 Subsequent events The NCB paid out £160,000 in compensation: £500 for each fatality, plus money for traumatised survivors and damaged property. Nine senior NCB staff were named as having some degree of responsibility for the accident and the tribunal report was scathing in its criticism of evidence given by the principal NCB witnesses. Lord Robens, addressing the National Union of Mineworkers in 1963 had said \\"If we are going to make pits safer for men we shall have to discipline the wrongdoer. I have no sympathy at all for those people—whether men, management or officials—who act in any way which endangers the lives and limbs of others.\\" No NCB staff were demoted, sacked or prosecuted as a consequence of the Aberfan disaster or for evidence given to the inquiry (one notably unsatisfactory witness had been promoted by the time Parliament debated the Davies Report); Lord Robens and the board of the NCB retained their positions. Following the report's publication, Robens wrote to the Minister of Power, Richard Marsh, offering his resignation. Although Robens had a combative relationship with the government and several cabinet ministers argued strongly that he should go, in September 1967 the Prime Minister Harold Wilson and Marsh refused to accept Robens's resignation offer. According to Ronald Dearing, a senior member of staff at the Ministry of Power, who briefed Marsh on the matter, the fact that Robens was \\"taking the coal industry through a period of painful contraction without big strikes\\" and the strong support for him within the coal industry and the union movement were crucial to the decision to retain him. Leo Abse spoke for many other critics: \\"..when I saw what I regarded as the graceless pavane danced by Lord Robens and the Minister, as the Chairman of the Coal Board coyly offered his resignation and, equally coyly, the Minister rejected the offer, I thought that it was a disgraceful spectacle.\\" Papers released in 1997 under the thirty-year rule show that Robens worked with the NUM to gather support, then agreed the wording of a letter from Marsh refusing Robens' resignation before offering his supposed resignation. In an interview broadcast in 2006, Marsh, after talking about a discussion with Robens, said: Notes References Bibliography *McLean, Iain and Johnes, Martin (2009), Aberfan: Government and Disasters, Cardiff: Welsh Academic Press, ; *Archives Network Wales – Glamorgan Record Office– Aberfan Disaster Inquiry, Chief Surveyor's Papers External links * *, containing: **Item 1.

He helped make an ad that criticized Cleland, while also tying him to Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. Furthermore, the ad seemed to question Cleland's patriotism. In an interview with HuffPost, Wilson thought that \\"DHS [Department of Homeland Security] was on the front line against Osama bin Laden\\". On July 18, 2015, Wilson tweeted that his ad questioned Cleland's votes. In November 2018, Wilson praised Qatar after visiting the Persian Gulf nation, which is accused of supporting terrorism and financing Muslim Brotherhood. He tweeted that \\"Qatar is a stunning, vibrant nation.\\" In January 2020, Wilson appeared alongside CNN anchor Don Lemon and CNN contributor Wajahat Ali to discuss United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's recent exchange with an NPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly. During this segment, Wilson made comments towards Trump supporters stating they were \\"part of the credulous boomer rube demo.\\" He also employed the tone of Southern American English in the segment for emphasis. In June 2020, Wilson tweeted a response to a 2012 Domino's Pizza tweet thanking White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, then a college student, for her opinion that Domino's pizza was superior to pizza from New York. In his tweet, Wilson declared, \\"You just killed your brand.\\" This later prompted a response from Domino's Pizza's official Twitter account, saying \\"Welp. It's unfortunate that thanking a customer for a compliment back in 2012 would be viewed as political. Guess that's 2020 for ya.\\" According to The Daily Dot, \\"Domino’s response immediately went viral,\\" however, it also credited Wilson for not deleting the tweet \\"despite the unrelenting onslaught of mockery\\" directed at him.

Gilbert, who was appointed CBE in 1980, was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers' Association. The Mystery Writers of America named him a Grand Master in 1988 and in 1990 he was presented Bouchercon's Lifetime Achievement Award. Like his first two books, it features Inspector Hazlerigg, although not in a major role. It is, in fact, a very diffuse book in terms of its characters. Angus McMann, who was the chief protagonist of Gilbert's previous book, They Never Looked Inside, is briefly mentioned on the first page and makes a later appearance as a minor character. Hazlerigg does not appear until page 24 and thereafter only at intervals throughout the book. There are, in actuality, three other protagonists who, along with Hazlerigg, share the role of driving the narrative. One is Noel Anthony Pontarlier Rumbold (\\"Nap\\"), a junior solicitor in his father's London firm. Nap had spent four months on dangerous missions with the French maquis in occupied France during the war and is, apparently, still a Lieutenant-Colonel, D.S.O. A few years later he will be a main character in Gilbert's well-received novel Death Has Deep Roots. Patrick (Paddy) Yeatman-Carter, an acquaintance of Nap's, is another lead character, as is his uncle, Alfred Lord Cedarbrook, a man with an astonishing background, much sought after by both the Foreign Office and the War Office during WWII and now, apparently, still affiliated with the Secret Service. As well as being a linguist, explorer, soldier, and diplomat, he also has a law degree. All three of them, to one degree or another, carry out private investigations, sometimes with the backing of Hazlerigg, sometimes not. Style and Contents As in some of his other early novels, Gilbert does not seem to have made up his mind about what kind of a narrative style to use. It is a third-person narrative, told by an omniscient narrator, but it veers between straightforward description, somewhat chatty semi-humorousness or facetiousness, and occasional hard-boiled grimness. It might in fact, be an early prototype of what later came to be called a caper novel. However, befitting Gilbert's status as a practicing solicitor, there are also numerous scenes set in one kind of court or another, and a number of other scenes revolving around finance and financial institutions, all of them done with his customary expertise. Plot and Title Stripped of all narrative complications, the basic story is simple. First Yeatman-Carter, then Nap, and finally Cedarbrook, become suspicious of the activities of a venerable, well- known London insurance company that is now being run, unbeknownst to its august Board of Directors, in a fraudulent manner by its manager, James Legate. Although Legate is actually a long-time, clandestine Communist, possibly even a Soviet agent, Legate is a competent businessman who has made Stalagmite into an important company while making himself a very wealthy man. He is, however, in actuality, defrauding the company, knowingly bringing it close to financial ruin, and feathering his own nest in the process. As Paddy, Nap, and Cedarbrook try to determine what is actually happening, Legate takes ruthless action to defend his position, instigating at least two murders and attempting to kill, or at least seriously injure all three of the amateur investigators. Legate represents a recurring character in many of Gilbert's novels: an apparently upright, prosperous businessman who is actually either the secret head of a criminal organization or simply a dishonest and highly corrupt man of affairs. In a Prologue to the novel, we are given an example of incongruous cause and supposed effect and are told that this aptly describes the events to follow. This may be true, but it may not be apparent to all readers. Reception and/or Later Appraisals The New York Times did not review it upon its American publication in 1962 and there are no discernible British reviews. The only easily found appraisal is in Barzun and Taylor's encyclopedic Catalogue of Crime: > The author's least satisfactory work. The usually competent Inspector > Hazlerigg stays on the sidelines while a pair of male amateurs (too > reminiscent of the bright young things of the thirties) look into possible > crookedness in a large insurance firm, thus inviting the usual sequence of > non-fatal retaliation.Jacques Barzun & Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of > Crime, Harper & Row, New York, \\"Second Impression Corrected\\", 1973, page 208  References  ;Attribution : Category:1949 British novels Category:Hodder & Stoughton books Category:British mystery novels ","title":"The Doors Open"},{"id":"52125953","text":"Colegio Antonio Rosmini is an Italian private & religious school in Maracaibo (Venezuela), created in the 1960s by the Rosminians. Father Giambattista Zantedeschi and the Colegio Italo – Venezolano A. Rosmini of Maracaibo History The Colegio Italo venezolano \\"Antonio Rosmini\\" was created in 1960 in the urbanization \\"Los Cerros de Marin\\", Maracaibo, by the catholic missionary fathers Rosminiani Giambattista Zantedeschi, Josito Gattoni and James Connolly. They started it while associated with the Italian private school \\"Garibaldi\\", but in 1966 they created in a huge area of 70,000 square meters the actual big \\"campus\\" of the Colegio Rosmini. Initially the school was opened with only a group of nearly one hundred Italian students, distributed between preschool and basic education from first through fifth grade (the courses were mainly in Italian language, but with some Spanish courses). In 1965 the Colegio Italo – Venezolano Antonio Rosmini of Maracaibo (estado Zulia) had 1300 students and it was the main school for the 87000 Italians residents in the Zulia area. Until the 1980s the \\"Rosmini\\" (as was called) was considered one of the Italian schools in Venezuela. Actually the Unidad Educativa \\"Colegio Rosmini\\" has nearly 3000 students (including evening students) and the courses are only in Spanish language; however Italian is done as a foreign language, mandatory in High School (\\"Bachillerato venezolano\\"). In 1995 the Colegio Rosmini was enriched with a church dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi, the saint patron of Italy. The Italian community in Maracaibo made possible the construction of the temple in honor of St. Francis of Assisi. On the altar, San Francisco is depicted in a painting by Italian artist Giovanni Vitti. Soon in Italy arose the view that the sanctuary of Maracaibo deserved a worthy bell tower of the great devotion to the venerable saint born in Gubbio: so, because of large donations from Italians, Maracaibo has a bell tower, that is a unique replica of the existing tower in St. Mark's Square in Venice. In addition to its majesty, it has eight bells made by hand in Anagni, capable of reproducing musical notes to offer a true concert of bells, in order to remember the message of Christ to neighbors and parishioners. All the students of the Colegio Rosmini celebrate often in the area under the church and the belfry.

He became one of the first Native Hawaiians to contract leprosy and the disease became known as maʻi aliʻi (the \\"sickness of the chiefs\\") in the Hawaiian language because of this association. Life Born in the late 18th century, George Naʻea was the son of High Chief Kamaunu and High Chiefess Kukaeleiki. His father Kamaunu was descended from the high chiefs of the northern districts of the island of Hawaii. His mother Kukaeleiki was the daughter of Kalauawa, a Kauaʻi high chief, and she was also a cousin of Queen Keōpūolani, the most sacred wife of Kamehameha I. Among Naʻea's more notable ancestors were Kalanawaʻa, a high chief of Oʻahu, and Kuaenaokalani, a Maui high chiefess who held the sacred kapu rank of Kekapupoʻohoʻolewaikala (the kapu of Poʻohoʻolewaikala, a rank so sacred that she could not be exposed to the sun except at dawn). His brother was Bennett Nāmākēhā, a member of the House of Nobles, and Nāmākēhā's granddaughter Stella Keomailani (1866–1927) was the last of the Poʻohoʻolewaikala line. George Naʻea's daughter Queen Emma of Hawaii Naʻea served under Kamehameha III as a member of his Council of Chiefs. He married Fanny Kekelaokalani Young, the hapa-haole (half-white) daughter of Kaʻōanaʻeha and John Young, the British advisor of King Kamehameha I. The couple lived on the island of Maui, in Lahaina, which was the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii at the time. They had three known children: Kahalaiʻa and Kekuaokalani, who both died young, and Emma, the future Queen Emma of Hawaii. Emma was given at birth to be raised by Fanny's younger sister Grace Kamaʻikuʻi and her husband Dr. Thomas Charles Byde Rooke under the Hawaiian tradition of hānai (informal adoption).; ; ; Naʻea played no role in his daughter's upbringing, and was not allowed contact with her due to his eventual illness. Historian and biographer of Queen Emma, George Kanahele wrote that \\"Emma never knew her natural father\\", and his relative anonymity prompted many to believe that Dr. Rooke was her biological father. Contracting leprosy Around 1838, Naʻea contracted leprosy. Many claimed that this was the first case of leprosy in Hawaii, even though the condition had been diagnosed earlier in the 1820s and 1830s. Differing accounts exist as to how he contracted this disease. Writing in 1864, Reverend Dwight Baldwin alleged that Naʻea had contracted the illness from a low-level royal who had returned from China with the leprosy infection. In his unpublished memoirs written before his death in 1932, Ambrose K. Hutchison, a resident superintendent of the leper settlement of Kalaupapa, recounted oral traditions on the origin of leprosy in Hawaii. According to Hutchison, Naʻea had contracted the illness from his Chinese cook who had arrived in the islands during the early sandalwood trade. The illness was diagnosed by the royal physician Dr. William Hillebrand, who recommended isolation for the incurable disease to the King and his Council of Chiefs. Thus Naʻea was banished to Wailuku, Maui and not allowed to return or visit Lahaina. Kanahele stated that he may have continued living under the care of his wife Fanny (who did not contract the disease), and continued to lead a productive life since Minister Robert Crichton Wyllie described him as a \\"highly respectable Hawaiian\\". Naʻea died on October 4, 1854. Hutchison claimed that after his death, the kahu or household attendants who had accompanied Naʻea during his isolation \\"scattered all over the Islands\\" and \\"that these attendants contracted the disease of their liege Lord and were the carriers that planted the disease on all the islands of Hawaii\\". From this association, leprosy became known as maʻi aliʻi (the \\"sickness of the chiefs\\").Citing Francis John Halford's Nine Doctors and God (1954), Kanahele claimed \\"The origin of the name had to do not with Naʻea but rather with a chief from the suite of Kekāuluohi, the premier under Kamehameha III, who was first treated for leprosy by the missionary doctor, Dwight Baldwin\\". (; ) The illness was also known as maʻi pake (the \\"Chinese sickness\\") after its place of origin. More than a decade after Naʻea's death, the Hawaiian government under Kamehameha V adopted a systematic policy of segregation for the afflicted, and established a leper settlement at Kalaupapa on the island of Molokaʻi, to which Peter Kaʻeo, a nephew of Fanny's and a cousin of Emma's, would be exiled in 1873.

The headquarters are located in Hammerfest. History In spring of 2007, Veolia Transport Norge restructured their subsidiaries that had been acquired since the beginning in 1999, to make larger regional units. Veolia Transport Nord AS (VTN) was created as a merger of Finnmark Fylkesrederi og Ruteselskap (FFR), Helgelandske, and the two former Nordtrafikk subsidiaries Nordtrafikk Buss and Nordtrafikk Maritim. FFR and Nordtrafikk's bus operations in Eastern Norway were moved to another regional unit. When Veolia sold their Norwegian operations in May 2011, renaming the Norwegian operations to Boreal Transport, the company was accordingly renamed Boreal Transport Nord AS (BTN), its current name. In July 2014, Boreal Transport Nord acquired Hurtigruten's 71.3%-share in TIRB, becoming the major owner. TIRB had the bus operating subsidiaries Cominor (100%) and Senja Rutebil (49.3%) In 2014, a PSO tender for all bus operations in Finnmark (except some minibus routes) was offered, and in 2015 it was won by Boreal Transport Nord as the only bidder. The contract lasts for seven years, starting from 1 January 2016, with an optional extension of up to three years. The buses were delivered by Scania and Mercedes-Benz. During 2016, a new restructure occurred, changing from regional units to units based on business areas. As BTN had all of Boreal's ferry operations, the company was renamed Boreal Sjø AS and all other business areas were moved to other Boreal companies. All non-commercial bus services were moved to Boreal Buss, while commercial operations were moved to Boreal Travel.

King was inducted into the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame in 1995. Music historian George Kanahele regarded King as the \\"Dean of Hawaiian Music\\", although this sobriquet is more associated with John Kameaaloha Almeida. Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame  Teaching and legislative career  Charles E. King (standing second from right) with the first graduating class of the Kamehameha School for Boys, 1891 Charles E. King was born of part Hawaiian ancestry, at the Nuʻuanu Valley estate of Queen Emma of Hawaii, in Honolulu, to Walter and Mary Ann Brash. He was adopted by his maternal grandfather John Lewis King after the death of his mother, and was christened by his godmother Queen Emma at St. Andrew's Cathedral. King was educated in public schools in Hawaii and the Kamehameha School for Boys. Following his 1891 graduation from Kamehameha School, Charles Reed Bishop, husband of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, paid his tuition at Oswego Primary Teachers Training School in New York. He returned to Hawaii, teaching music in the Kailua-Kona school district, and also at Kamehameha School for Boys. In 1914, Kamehameha alumni circulated a petition requesting that King be named school principal, but Ernest C. Webster was chosen instead.; When Bishop Estate trustee Samuel Mills Damon resigned in 1916, the trustees named former teacher William Williamson, a white man, to fill the vacancy. As established by the original trust deed, any trustee appointment had to be approved by the Supreme Court of the Hawaiian Islands. With his post-teaching success in business, Williamson's nomination easily received that approval. The nomination ran into trouble with Judge C. W. Ashford of the probate court that was charged with overseeing trusts. Ashford decreed that the slot should be filled by someone of Hawaiian ancestry, and therefore representative of the very people for whom the trust was established. He appointed alumnus King, who had spoken openly about his concerns that the school was under-performing academically and not adequately preparing its graduates for career or economic success. Ashford's appointment of King was overturned on appeal in the ninth circuit court, which ruled in favor of the original Williamson appointment having been in strict accordance with the trust deed.King, Roth (2006), pp. 45–47; ; After considering a run for various elected offices in 1917, King successfully ran on the Republican ticket in 1918 for a seat in the Territory of Hawaii senate.; ; The College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts of the Territory of Hawaii was authorized by the legislature in 1907 and first began operating in 1908 on Young Street in Honolulu. The institution's name was changed in 1911 to College of Hawaii and relocated to the Manoa valley. A community need to expand the school's curriculum and offer university-level degrees, led to King's introducing Senate Bill 76 in 1919, creating the legislation to establish the University of Hawaii at Manoa. While still serving in the legislature, he also led campus song concerts at the university.; ; ;  Music career  He grew up surrounded by traditional Hawaiian mele style of music and was a musical protégé of Liliuokalani. King began pursuing songwriting sometime in mid-life, publishing the first two of his three books of sheet music when he was 42 years old. \\"Kamehameha Waltz\\" was penned by King as a paean to his alma mater and to Bernice Pauahi Bishop who created the trust fund that established the school, \\"Majestic stands Kamehameha/My home of education\\"...\\"For you, O great Pauahi, high chiefess/Our exclamations of joy\\". The song was performed in 1914 by the King Glee Club as part of The Woods of Hawaii musical presentation at the Honolulu Opera House, sponsored by the Christian youth organization Young People's League.; It was first recorded on May 18, 1928 by the Charles E. King Male Chorus on the Columbia Records label. Since then, it has become a standard at the school's annual song contest. His compositions were favored by Hawaiian lap steel guitarist Sol Hoʻopiʻi who, along with Glenwood Leslie and Lani McIntyre as Sol Hoopii's Novelty Trio, recorded 17 of King's songs from 1927–1931. Catafalque of Liliuokalani being carried out of ʻIolani Palace The most famous song associated with King, \\"Ke Kali Nei Au\\" (Waiting For Thee), is known to today's audiences as the Hawaiian Wedding Song. Recorded by numerous modern-day artists, King's original lyrics are not the same as the 1958 translation by Al Hoffman and Dick Manning. King's version was not a wedding song but one of several tunes written for his Hawaiian-language opera The Prince of Hawaii. At its May 4, 1925 premiere, Ray Kinney starred in the lead of Prince Kauikalu, with Rose Tribe as Queen Kamaka, and Joseph Kamakau as King Kalani. The production toured the mainland United States with King in 1926. \\"Ke Kali Nei Au\\" was first recorded in Honolulu on May 22, 1928 on the Columbia Records label as a duet with Helen Desha Beamer and Sam Kapu Sr. accompanied by the Don Barrientos Hawaiia n Orchestra. At the 1917 state funeral of his musical mentor Liliuokalani, King led the Young People's League in singing her composition \\"Aloha ʻOe\\" on the balcony of ʻIolani Palace as her catafalque was carried out to take her casket for entombment in the Kalākaua Crypt of the Royal Mausoleum of Mauna ʻAla.; He served as conductor of the Royal Hawaiian Band for two non-sequential periods, 1932–1934 and 1939–1941.  Personal life  In 1911, King's wife Jean Bates died of cancer and was buried at Kawaiahaʻo Church cemetery. Through his musical work with the Young People's League, he became acquainted with Emma Liftee of Kona. The couple was married by Rev. Akaiko Akana on July 26, 1915. When the United States entered World War II, King relocated to Elmhurst, New York, with his last wife Regina P. Hughes and began pursuing his music publishing interests. He died on February 27, 1950.  Publications     *  Compositions  Partial listing.

It was released on July 8, 2016 for Android and August 18, 2016 for iOS. The game is described as a \\"storytelling messenger game\\" and is available in Korean, English, and Spanish. In 2017, Mystic Messenger was awarded Best Indie Game at the 2017 Korea Game Awards.  Plot  In Mystic Messenger, the player takes the role of a female character whose name is chosen by the player. The female protagonist downloads a mysterious app that leads her into living in either a closed, secured apartment owned by Rika, the founder of a charity organization known as the RFA (Rika's Fundraising Association), or the Mint Eye HQ. She meets the remaining members of the RFA and is tasked to organize a party by inviting guests. In Another Story, Unknown tricks the protagonist into playing the game and brings you to Mint Eye, keeping you by his side. The protagonist is able to choose one out of 7 available routes, each with their own backgrounds, as well as finding out the truth behind the RFA.  Characters  :The following Korean romanization follows the official romanization from the game itself; it may be different from the usual pronunciation.  Main characters  ; Protagonist : After suddenly becoming a member of RFA and being forced to live in Rika's apartment, she takes Rika's role and organizes the party that the RFA members have been longing for. Her default avatar comes in 5 various appearances, but she appears to have brown, long silky hair and is drawn with her eyes hidden under bangs as shown in the CGs. ; Jumin Han : : Jumin Han (한주민, Han Ju-min) is a 27-year-old heir of C&R; International, a company owned by his father. He has short black hair, grey eyes and is always on business trips, he likes to wear tuxedos, and is not used to 'commoner' food. Jumin is a cat lover claiming that only cats understand and are loyal to him. He owns a Persian cat named Elizabeth the 3rd and hates when someone else nicknames her - especially 707, who gives her the nickname \\"Elly\\". Due to his very privileged upbringing, Jumin has a very different perspective on the world, which often brings him into direct conflict with Zen. Regardless, he doesn't particularly seem to care what others think about him but does not hesitate to use his authority to help RFA members when one of them is in trouble. He and V are childhood friends due to their family background and because of them being neighbors and schoolmates. : Jumin is also very close to his father and they often exchange gifts, though most of the gifts are extremely extravagant. He is not fond of his father's many on and off girlfriends. Jumin also loves wine and can hold his alcohol well. He enjoys teasing Zen and holds a complicated relationship with him. ; Zen : : Zen (stylized as ZEN) is the stage name of Hyun Ryu (류현, Ryu Hyeon), a 24-year-old musical stage artist. He has pale skin, red-brown colored eyes, and white- colored hair that is short at the front and long at the back, implying that he's an albino. Despite being a self-absorbed due to his looks, he wants people to acknowledge him for his skills and personality instead. Zen loves to workout and rehearse constantly to perfect his skills. He is seen to be oversensitive towards Jumin, nicknaming him \\"Mr. Trust Fund Kid\\" and refuses any help from him because he reminds him of his brother. He is allergic to cats (specifically cat fur), sneezing even when the word 'cat' is mentioned. Zen is also very protective of the other members, especially the protagonist, and always warned her to be wary of the guys and their 'wolf attitude'. In Another Story, a running joke is how he has a lot of outdated electronic items he picks up from junkyards much to Yoosung's frustration. : Zen has an older brother who is a lawyer. In Zen's storyline, it is revealed that he has a difficult relationship with his parents and he left home at age 16 to pursue acting. He owns a motorbike kept in storage and was once rescued by V after an accident. : Zen's birthday is on April 1st and he became the focus in the game's April's Fools DLC. ; 707 : : 707, or his baptismal name Luciel Choi (최 루시엘, Choi Lusiel) is a 22-year-old genius hacker and intelligence agent, he is also the one who made the RFA Messenger app. 707, also referred to as Seven, has short curly red hair, amber eyes and is a self-proclaimed devoted Catholic who loves to eat junk food (especially Ph.D. Pepper and Honey Buddha Chips). He has a very mischievous attitude and loves cats in a 'unique' way. He tends to talk in a very strange way that none of the members understand except the protagonist. His hobbies include collecting sports cars and hacking. His house is so well guarded that it's required to speak Arabic to pass his security system. Despite his seemingly carefree, easy-going personality, he always warns the other members to \\"keep their distance\\" from him because of his job as a secret agent. 707 tends to break the 4th wall more than anyone in the game. : 707, whose birth name is Saeyoung Choi (최세영, Choi Se-yeoung), grew up with his younger twin brother, Saeran, in a toxic household. They're illegitimate children whose father was a candidate for a presidential election at that time. This caused their mother to be driven into depression - she asked him for money in exchange for the information of the twins being kept secret, and so she kept them locked up in the house. Being the healthier twin, Saeyoung was tasked to occasionally do some errands which allowed him to briefly leave the house. On his way home, he met various people at a Catholic church as well as Rika who later helped convert him to Catholicism, and he gained his baptismal name Luciel. At the age of 15, Saeyoung was promised by V a better life for his brother in exchange for him working as a hacker and thus had to cease all contact with his family, leaving him unaware of what happened in his absence. ; Yoosung : : Yoosung Kim (김유성, Kim Yu-seong) is a 21-year-old college student and an addicted online gamer of a game called LOLOL (stands for League of Loneliness of Life), a parody of the MOBA League of Legends, he is ranked 2 in the server, with 707 apparently beating him in the first rank. Due to his addiction, he doesn't have time for studying, despite being smart enough to get a scholarship at his school, SKY University, and get an internship offer from Jumin. Yoosung is also Rika's adoptive cousin, Rika was adopted by Yoosung's aunt who immediately regrets adopting Rika. He is unable to move on after her death, whom he admired so much even though they only met when he was a 6th grader. : Rika was Yoosung's biggest influence. She's also the reason in Yoosung taking a medical major. Rika's death apparently hit him so hard that only playing LOLOL could distract him from his sadness. Due to this, he also initially compared the protagonist with Rika so much to the point that he would see her as Rika's replacement. : In Valentine's after ending, he appears to have cut his hair, abandoned his hairpins, wear red- framed glasses that the protagonist gave him in the after ending, and talks in a deeper tone. ; Jaehee Kang : : Jaehee Kang (강제희, Kang Jae-hee) is currently the only female member of RFA besides the protagonist. She is a 26-year-old Chief Assistant at C&R; International and Jumin's personal assistant. She has brown pixie-cut styled hair, brown eyes and initially appeared as stoic, serious, and suspicious of the protagonist's sudden appearance. Despite this, she's a big fan of Zen, and her personality changes when she's talking about Zen. She tends to be overworked by Jumin and is forced to take care of Elizabeth the 3rd, even though she hates it when cat hair is all over her house. She is also forced to keep her hair short and wears glasses even though she has fine eyesight due to Jumin's policy. : Jaehee's mother married a man who was at least 20 years older than her who then died quickly. Her mother then died not long after that, forcing a relative to take care of young Jaehee despite their unwillingness. Because of that, Jaehee tends to not rely on other people and is also afraid that if she no longer works for C&R; International, something bad will occur. In her route, she takes an interest in coffee and wants to open her own coffee shop. After retiring from C&R; International, she let her hair grow and no longer wears glasses. Her route is the only route that is not explicitly romantic. ; V : : V, whose real name is Jihyun Kim (김지현, Kim Ji-hyeon) is 27-years-old and a childhood friend of Jumin and the leader of RFA. He was Rika's fiancé and another person who was driven to sadness upon her death. V is very protective of his friends and would rather be put to blame or hide secrets from RFA to keep them from getting hurt. He does not appear in the messenger often and is often criticized for keeping too many secrets from RFA. It is revealed that he wears a pair of sunglasses to hide his eyes after getting into an accident where he began gradually losing his sight. V's eye injury was caused by Rika during one of her manic episodes. V has always suspected Rika's death was faked and he has been secretly posing undercover in Mint Eye as a disciple to get closer to Rika and Saeran. This is the reason why he has been inactive with the RFA and kept his actions a secret from the RFA, especially from Jumin and 707. In Another Story, he suspected that the protagonist was secretly being held hostage by Mint Eye and attempted several times to rescue her. : In the Secret Ending, he is accidentally shot and dies in the process during Saeran's rescue. : Initially being a side character, in September 2017, Cheritz released Another Story which allows the player to develop a relationship with V. The Another Story puts the main character 2 years prior to the main story shortly after Rika's \\"death\\". It is revealed that V's mother was a talented violinist who started to lose her hearing during her pregnancy with V. Having an unhappy marriage, his parents divorced and V was separated from his mother. While raised to follow his father's footsteps as a businessman, V's mother encouraged him to follow his true passion for arts, particularly drawing and painting. : In the Christmas 2016 DLC, it is revealed that V and Jumin often exchanged handwritten letters and that V has poor handwriting ; Rika : : Rika (리카) is adored by RFA's members since the organization was founded by her and V, her ex-fiancee. When she was \\"alive\\", she wanted to make everyone happy, with one method being a charity party to raise money for those in need. She had severe mental issues from an early age caused by her dad leaving her and her mother committing suicide. Her mental issues worsened after her dog, Sally, wound up dead due to her blindness. It is later found out that Rika is not dead, but instead founded Mint Eye, a cult that is after RFA. She attempts to steal party guests from the RFA to invite to her new organization. She claims that she wants the entire world to be happy, and wishes for them to come to \\"Paradise.\\" She works with Unknown in Mint Eye and is called Savior by her followers. : Rika is not Yoosung's biological relative. It is revealed that she was adopted by Yoosung's Aunt and Uncle but was treated poorly by her foster parents. She lived in an orphanage for sometime before being adopted and was estranged from her foster parents during the events of Mystic Messenger. She has a great relationship with Yoosung and his family and often encouraged Yoosung to find a positive purpose in life. Rika and V have impacted the lives of all the RFA members, it was Rika who first discovered Zen, encouraged Yoosung to do volunteer work and be a vet, gave Jumin Elizabeth, and met Seven and Saeran when they were still children at church. : : In Another Story, it appears that Rika may show interest in the main character. One of the Bad Ending route options allows the player to be with Rika. ; Unknown / Saeran / Ray : : Unknown (also referred to as '???' in the visual novel mode and 'Ray' in Another Story) is a hacker who led the protagonist into Rika's apartment and is part of a mysterious cult called \\"Mint Eye\\". Unknown also appears to hold an especially strong grudge towards 707, and is revealed to be his twin brother in 707's route whose real name is Saeran. He appears as an antagonist and causes most of the bad endings in the game. : In 707's Secret Endings 707 rescues Unknown and begins the long process of rehabilitating Saeran from the effects of Mint Eye's brainwashing. : Unknown's real name is Saeran and he is the twin brother of 707. He was the weaker of the twins and was often abused and locked up by their mother. Sometime after 707 was recruited into the intelligence agency, Rika and V rescued Saeran but the rescue was short-lived as Rika started to slowly groom Saeran to be a hacker and kidnapped and brainwashed him into Mint Eye soon after. : In Another Story, he is called Ray and appears to have a split personality who is referred to as Saeran. Ray lures the main character into Mint Eye under the premise of her testing a game, trying to convince her that people from the RFA are AI's and not real people. Saeran's personality is very aggressive, arrogant, and full of rage while Ray is very gentle, thoughtful, and clingy towards the main character, both have an unwavering loyalty towards Rika. : At the end of his route, his two personalities become one, and he is referred to as Saeran, although the MC can still choose to call him Ray. ; Vanderwood : : Vanderwood (벤더우드) is another agent working in the same agency as 707, he serves as someone who is tasked to make sure 707 is working, he also cleans 707's house. He brings a taser gun and an Arabic dictionary due to 707's security gate. He is initially introduced as 707's maid almost every time and in the earlier versions of the artbook  Minor Characters  :Choi Sarah : Choi Sarah is one of the main antagonists of Jumin's route and the sister of Glam Choi. :Choi Glam : Choi Glam is one of the main antagonists of Jumin's route and the sister of Sarah Choi. :Chairman Han :Jumin's Father :Echo Girl : Echo Girl is the main antagonist of Zen's route. :Believers : Believers only appear in Another Story and are members of the Mint Eye cult. :Saejoong Choi : The illegitimate father of Saeyoung Choi(707) and Saeran Choi(Unknown/Ray) who is one of the main antagonists in Ray's route. Gameplay The story lasts for 11 days per route. The first day concerns the game's prologue, three days for the \\"common route\\", six days focusing on a route of a character, and one day for the party. The game plays in real time, where players can receive text messages and join the group chat in a special messenger. Throughout conversations in the first four days, the player can give responses to certain characters to increase their likability with them, symbolized as hearts. By the end of the fourth day, the player will encounter a Caution; it branches the game and determines whether the player will get a route or a bad ending depending on their accumulated hearts and chatroom participation within the four days. During each route, the story has three Cautions in different days. Routes There are 7 routes in total. 3 routes are available in Casual Story (Zen, Yoosung, and Jaehee), 2 routes in Deep Story (Jumin Han and 707), and 2 routes in Another Story (V and Ray). The game originally had 2 stories (Casual Story and Deep Story) and 5 routes, until on September 8, 2017, Cheritz released a route for V in a separate story. The story is named \\"Another Story\\" and the main character appears a year prior to the time in the original story. On January 31, 2018, Cheritz released a route for Saeran/Ray in the same story. The routes cost 550 Hourglasses in total. Downloadable contents In December 2016, Cheritz added a new \\"special content\\" section to the game. The DLC contains new chatrooms, messages, CGs, phone calls, ringtones, and background music. The Christmas episode was added on December 19, 2016; the story lasts for 2 days with 8 endings. The April's Fools episode was added on March 21, 2017; the story lasts for a day with 3 endings. In early February 2017, Cheritz added Valentine's after endings for each character (excluding V and Ray). These special contents remain available even after said events.  Others = Music  The game features two songs - the opening theme is sung by Han titled \\"Mysterious Messages\\" and ending song sung by Han and Sirius titled \\"Like the Sun in the Sky\\". Both are composed by DoubleTO. About 23 tracks of background music, composed by Flaming Heart, were released along with the opening and ending song and 13 tracks of free talk with people involved in the making via the game's special package.  Official merchandise  In June 2016, Cheritz opened a pre-order session for the game's limited edition special package called RFA VIP Package. The package contains original soundtracks from the game, 2 artbooks, characters' name card, and 2 DVDs of the freetalk session with the voice actors involved in the game. It also contains serial number to unlock the game's VIP membership, which enables player to fast forwarding a chatroom, calling the characters without limits, and 1000 Hourglasses. In July 2017, Cheritz released dakimakura covers for 707 and Jumin Han, who topped the popularity poll, for Mystic Messenger's first anniversary.  Official Comic  Over the years, unofficial fan-made comics based on the game have been made. By godsend, an official manhwa (Korean comic) is under the works and it already has a prologue, as well as a first chapter. Currently, they can be found in two languages (Korean and English), but talk has been made of the manhwa being available in three more languages.

Life Small was born in Polmont on Boxing day in 1857. From the age of six to thirteen she was educated by her mother. She then attended the School for the Daughters of Missionaries in Walthamstow. She was one of three daughters and they all became missionaries like their father. In 1876 the Free Church of Scotland's Ladies' Society for Female Education in India and South Africa sent her to India where she was to remain until 1892 when she returned to the UK due to her health. Small had written \\"Light and Shade in Zenana Missionary Life\\" in 1890 which described the qualities required by aspiring female missionaries. Small was familiar not only with being a missionary in India but she had also spent time becoming familiar with the local traditions and customs. In October 1894 Small applied her knowledge as the first principal of the Women's Missionary Training Institute (later renamed St Colm's College). Drawing on the independence she had learnt in Walthamstow Small encouraged her charges to develop themselves and not just to follow some pre-defined formula for becoming a missionary. The institute prepared women to engage women in Christian missions, such as in Zenana missions. The institute attracted students of different denominations and from Switzerland, Germany and Scandinavia. The institute was renamed in 1908 as the Women's Missionary College as the Free Church became part of the United Free Church of Scotland. In 1910 she was very involved with the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh. In the same year Small had her mother living with her at the institute.

On October 28, 2016, the Boeing 767-300ER operating the flight (registered N345AN) was accelerating for takeoff down Chicago O'Hare's runway 28R when the aircraft's right engine suffered an uncontained failure that led to a severe fire. The crew managed to abort the takeoff and evacuate everyone on board, while responding emergency services extinguished the fire. Twenty- one people were injured, and the aircraft was substantially damaged and written off. The right engine suffered a sudden rupture of the stage 2 disk operating at takeoff power. The disk separated into two pieces, the smaller of which pierced the wing's fuel tank and then flew , falling through the roof of a United Parcel Service (UPS) facility and coming to rest on the building's floor. No UPS employees occupying the building were injured.  Aircraft and crew  The aircraft, a Boeing 767-323(ER) powered by two General Electric CF6-80C2B6 engines, registration number N345AN, was delivered to American in 2003. The right side of the fuselage suffered considerable fire damage. The right wing collapsed about midway along its length. American subsequently declared the aircraft a hull loss. The accidents marks the 17th hull loss of a Boeing 767. The captain was 61-year-old Anthony Paul Kochenash. He had been flying with American Airlines since May 2001 and previously flown with TWA from January 1986 to April 2001. Kochenash also served with U.S. Navy from May 1976 to December 1985 as a veteran of The Iran–Iraq War. He had 17,400 flight hours, including 4,000 hours on the Boeing 767. The first officer was 57-year- old David Travis Ditzel. Like the captain, he had also been working for American Airlines since May 2001 and previously flown with TWA from December 1995 to April 2001. Ditzel also served with U.S. Navy from May 1980 to December 1995 as an veteran of The Iran–Iraq War, The Gulf War, and The Bosnian War. He had 22,000 flight hours, with 1,600 of them on the Boeing 767.  Accident  At 14:30 central daylight time (CDT), Flight 383 was cleared for takeoff on runway 28R. The aircraft commenced its takeoff roll one minute later with the captain as the pilot flying and the first officer as the pilot monitoring. At 14:31:32, the first officer called out \\"eighty knots,\\" however, 11 seconds after this callout was made, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recorded a loud noise. The aircraft began to veer right and the captain rejected the takeoff. The damage to the aircraft after the fire was extinguished The first officer radioed to the control tower, \\"American three eighty three heavy stopping on the runway.\\" The controller had already noticed the engine failure and responded \\"roger roger. Fire,\\" advising the crew of the situation. The first officer asked the tower controller, \\"do you see any smoke or fire?\\" The controller said \\"yeah fire off the right wing.\\" The first officer ordered the fire trucks to be sent to the aircraft. The captain called for the engine fire checklist, the right engine was shut off, and its fire extinguisher was activated. The captain then called for the evacuation checklist, during which the flight attendants had already initiated an evacuation, despite the command not having been given. After shutting down the left engine, the captain finally gave the evacuation command and sounded the evacuation alarm. The first emergency exit (the left overwing window exit) was opened 8 to 12 seconds after the aircraft stopped. After completing the evacuation checklist, the pilots then evacuated.  Investigation and recommendations In July 2017, GE Aviation issued a Service Bulletin recommending that airlines perform regular inspections of first- and second- stage disks of all CF6 engines built prior to 2000. On January 30, 2018, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued its final report on the incident involving American 383. It traced the origin of the failure in disk 2 to a \\"discrete dirty white spot\\" that in the Board's judgement would have been undetectable, at manufacture or subsequent inspection, with the inspection techniques available. The NTSB made several safety recommendations as a result, not only with regards to the engine and aircraft but also to issues raised by the evacuation. Engine inspections Although the CF6 had been the subject of multiple Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness directives, they had not focused on the larger, relatively slower Stage 1 disks at the front of the engine, made with a nickel alloy. Although the FAA had signaled its intent to issue an order for ultrasonic inspections of CF6-80s in September 2017, the NTSB called for such inspections to be extended to all large commercial aircraft engine models in service. On August 30, 2018 the FAA issued an airworthiness directive that required airlines to perform ongoing ultrasonic inspections for cracks in stage 1 and stage 2 disks on engines like those involved in Flight 383. The NTSB also called for increased design precautions, based on multiple uncontained disk ruptures, to be continually integrated into all commercial aircraft design, especially of the wings and fuel tanks; the FAA has not yet responded to that recommendation. Procedures The Board recommended separate engine fire checklists for ground vs. in-flight operation; the checklist used did not so differentiate, and so did not include a separate step where, if the plane was on the ground, the other engine should be stopped to allow evacuation. As a result, a passenger evacuating using the left overwing exit was the only person seriously injured when they were knocked to the ground by exhaust from the still-operating engine. In addition, the checklist provided to the pilots called for discharge of only one of the two fire extinguisher bottles in the affected engine, followed by a wait of 30 seconds to judge its effectiveness; however, other checklists specific to ground operations call for immediate use of both bottles in order to create a safer environment for evacuation of the aircraft. The Board also faulted communication efforts among the crew, including the inability of flight attendants to successfully operate the interphone (which differed from the model used in training) and the failure of the flight crew to keep attendants informed of their intention to evacuate. The Board also called for research into countermeasures against passengers evacuating with carry-on luggage despite being specifically instructed not to do so by crew.

Before joining Stony Brook University as an assistant professor in 1979, he taught at the University of Arizona (visiting lecturer in the Political Science Department in 1978), the University of Cologne, and the University of Texas. In 1980, he was promoted to associate professor at Stony Brook University, and became a tenured full professor there in 1985. Research Norpoth's research focuses on multiple subjects in political science, including public opinion and electoral behavior, and predicting the results of elections in the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. \\"Primary Model\\" for US presidential elections Norpoth developed the Primary Model, a statistical model of United States presidential elections based on data going back to 1912. The Primary Model is based on two factors: whether the party that has been in power for a long time seems to be about to lose it, and whether a given candidate did better in the primaries than his or her opponent. The model was first used in the 1996 election. In February 2015, he projected that Republicans had a 65 percent chance of winning the general election the following year. In 2016, this model gained significant media attention because it predicted that Donald Trump would win the general election. In response to critics who cited polls in which Clinton led Trump by a significant margin, Norpoth said that these polls were not taking into account who will actually vote in November, writing, \\"…nearly all of us say, oh yes, I'll vote, and then many will not follow through.\\" On March 2, 2020, Norpoth stated that his model gave Trump a 91% chance at winning re-election.

It is a tree or mallee, with hard, rough bark, lance- shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and usually conical fruit. Description Eucalyptus chlorophylla is a tree that typically grows to a height of or a mallee to with hard, rough, grey-brown to bleached grey bark, and that forms a lignotuber. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, wide and green to greyish green. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped or curved, the same glossy green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering occurs in November or December and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, conical or cup-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long. The fruit remain on the tree and contain blackish brown seeds long, flattened-oval and sometimes pointed at one end. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus chlorophylla was first formally described in 1986 by Ian Brooker and Christopher Done from a specimen located by Brooker in 1982 near Kununurra. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (chlorophylla) is derived from the Ancient Greek words chloros meaning \\"green\\" and phyllon meaning \\"leaf\\". Distribution and habitat Green-leaf box is found scattered over plains and low rises in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, near Kununurra and Fitzroy Crossing spreading east through the top end of the Northern Territory from a latitude between Mataranka south to about Tennant Creek and then in the Gulf Country of Queensland as far east as the hinterland of the Gulf of Carpentaria.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. It is a large and intact example of a courtyard style of apartment building complex, not found elsewhere on East Jefferson Avenue. The Pilgrim and Puritan provided housing for Detroit's growing professional and middle-class during a time when the surrounding area was being developed with luxury apartment buildings. History Harry Silverman was born in Romania and emigrated to Brooklyn, New York in 1905 at the age of eighteen. He trained as a building contractor, and in 1912 moved to Detroit and in 1913 started his own firm where he developed and quickly sold apartment building complexes. John B. Whitley was a born in Halifax, England, and came to Detroit in 1915 at the age of 35. There he opened his own real estate firm. Both Silverman and Whitley were Masons, which is presumably how they met. In 1924, the two men formed a partnership to construct a trio of apartment buildings next to each other: the Pilgrim, the Puritan, and the Plymouth (now demolished). Silverman and Whitley brought in architect Charles N. Agree to design the apartment complexes, and construction was completed in 1924. In 1925, Silverman sold his interest to Whitley, ending their partnership. The first residents of the apartment Complex were Detroit's rising professional and middle class, and included a number of salesmen, executives, clerks, teachers, doctors and nurses. The buildings have continued in use as apartments since construction. The Plymouth was demolished in the mid-1980s, while the Pilgrim and Puritan were renovated about the same time. There are plans for a second rehabilitation of the Pilgrim and Puritan. Description The Pilgrim and Puritan Apartment Complex consists of two nearly identical U-shaped four story red brick apartment buildings with flat roofs. The center entrance is reached through the courtyard formed by the U. Neoclassical and Commercial Brick elements are used on the buildings in an asymmetrical way to create an overall symmetric appearance. The raised basement portion of the building is clad with limestone, and red brick walls (rusticated on the first floor) extend above. A short wall with fencing is between the two.

He is noted as the first \\"full chieftain of the Conmaicne\\" of present-day south county Leitrim, and parts of west County Longford. His descendants are known as \\"the Muintir Eolais\\". Biography Eolais was born into a Túath of the Conmaicne settled in present-day south county Leitrim, in the second half of the 9th century. As an adult, he became chieftain of his sept. A charismatic leader, he became the first full chieftain of the \\"Conmaicne Réin\\" c. AD 900. He married, having at least three sons, named \\"Brocan\\", the ancestor of Shanley; \\"Anbeith\\", the ancestor of Mac Garry; and \\"Maolmuire\\", lord of Conmaicne Réin and ancestor of Mag Raghnaill (anglicised Mac Rannell, Reynolds). Ódhrán Ua hEolais, a famous scribe of Clonmacnoise, was probably his grandson. Eolais's death is not recorded by the Irish Annals, but probably occurred between A.D. 920–960. Legacy Eolais Mac Biobhsach is the ancestor of the Muintir Eolais who were the most famous of the ancient Leitrim sub-septs of the Conmaicne territories of modern-day Leitrim (barony) and Mohill (barony). The primary sept of Eolais today are Reynolds, Mulvey, Shanley, and McGarry. From the 11th to 17th centuries, the (\\"'tribe of Eolais'\\") ruled most of the territory of present- day south county Leitrim. Place names preserve his memory. The townland of Corryolus () located in the town of Carrick on Shannon clearly retains his name. In the remote mountainous Cuilcagh-Anierin uplands, the oligotrophic lake named \\"Lough Munter Eolas\\" marks a borderline between west Cavan and south Leitrim. Tributes A well established Leitrim-Longford traditional fiddle group, trained by a Fr. Quinn since 1966, adopted the name \\"Ceolus\\" preserving his name, and they play music garnered from local manuscripts going back almost two hundred years. Surname O'Donovan claimed the family name ( \\"descendant of Eolais\\") is still found anglicised as \\"Olus\\" or \\"Olis\\". two instances of the surname corrupted as \\"Oelase\\" and \\"Olase\\", are found in the Irish Fiants for Leinster.

He conducted metal aircraft building forums at the Rockford and Oshkosh EAA fly-ins for 25 years. Mustangs The FAA pre-cover inspection of the first wing of his prototype Midget Mustang was January, 1953. Bob built his prototype version of the Midget, N15J, and first flew it on September 9, 1959.http://www.mustangaero.com/images/Mustang%20II/CAFE.PDF In 1959 he purchased the rights to the Midget Mustang and began to sell prints for the M-I. In San Antonio, Texas he built six Midget Mustang aircraft. In 1963 he began work on a two place design based on the Midget Mustang. In 1965 the first ever Mustang II (N1117M) was brought to the EAA convention at Rockford (by trailer) and in 1966 the prototype was flown to the convention. For the next 26 years Bushby Aeronautics sold plans and kits for the Mustang II. In March, 1992 Mustang Aeronautics, Inc. acquired the design rights from Robert Bushby for both the Midget Mustang and Mustang II aircraft.

Two crew members, the only people on board, were unharmed.  Aircraft and crew  N370FE, the aircraft involved in the accident The aircraft was a McDonnell Douglas MD-10-10F airliner, built in 1972 as a DC-10 passenger aircraft and later converted to cargo configuration. It was delivered to FedEx in August 1997 and upgraded to an MD-10 in 2003. The aircraft was powered by three General Electric CF6-6D engines, and was 44 years old at the time of the accident. The captain, age 55, was hired as a flight engineer by FedEx in 2000, he previously served with the U.S. Air Force from 1982 to 2000 as a veteran of the Gulf War, Bosnian War, and Kosovo War. At the company, he worked in the Boeing 727 as a flight engineer, a first officer, and a captain, as well as a captain on the MD-11. He had a total flight time of about 10,000 hours (he was uncertain about his time as pilot-in-command) and estimated about 1,500 hours in the MD-11. The first officer, age 47, was hired as a flight instructor by FedEx in 2004, he previously served with the U.S. Air Force from 1990 to 2004 as an veteran of the Gulf War, Bosnian War, and Kosovo War. In 2007, he became a flight engineer in the Boeing 727 and became a first officer in the MD-11 in 2012. He estimated a total flight time of 6,000 to 6,300 hours, with about 4,000 hours as pilot-in-command. He estimated a total time of about 400 to 500 hours in the MD-11.  Accident  FedEx 910 landed on Fort Lauderdale's runway 10L at 17:50 local time (21:50Z). The tower reported the left side CF6 engine appeared on fire. The aircraft came to a stop about 2,000 meters (6,580 feet) down the runway and beyond the left edge with the left main gear collapsed and the left wing on fire. The airport closed all runways while emergency services responded to put the fire out. The two crew members had no injuries, but the aircraft received substantial damage. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) dispatched five investigators on site and opened an investigation. On October 31, the NTSB reported that the left main gear failed after landing and during rollout. The left engine and left wing scraped the runway and the aircraft veered to the left and came to a stop partially off the runway. Both flight crew members escaped through the right cockpit window using an escape rope. No injuries were reported. Cockpit voice and flight data recorders were taken to the NTSB lab in Washington for analysis. Following an examination of the runway, the NTSB returned control of the runway to the Fort Lauderdale Airport.  Investigation  On August 23, 2018 the NTSB reported that \\"the failure of the left main gear was the result of a metal fatigue crack that initiated within the gear,\\" and cited FedEx's failure to overhaul the gear at the manufacturer- recommended eight-year interval as a contributor to the crash.

This waterway once linked the old coaching inn, now the Drovers Inn, at Inverarnan, on the Allt Arnan Burn (a tributary of the Falloch) to the River Falloch and passengers could continue southward to Loch Lomond and finally to Balloch. From Inverarnan stagecoaches ran to various destinations in the north of Scotland. History A view of the canal near the basin. Detail of the canal bank construction. The hamlet of Inverarnan with its 300-year-old inn lies in the council area of Stirling, Scotland, on the A82 road, 2.5 km north of the hamlet of Ardlui, Argyll and Bute at the head of Loch Lomond (into which the River Falloch flows), and about 10 km SW of Crianlarich. The canal was privately built with the support of steamship owners Mr David Napier and Mr John McMurrickArrochar & Tarbert Heritage Site in order to permit steamers to avoid the sometimes shallow water, gravel banks and bends of the River Falloch's course to the head of Loch Lomond and also to allow convenient travel directly to Inverarnan, which was a stagecoach stop and had a drovers' inn which provided refreshments, accommodation, etc.Secret Scotland - Lost CanalsArrochar & Tarbert Heritage Site Ransom states that the canal was dug at the expense of the Marquis of Breadalbane who also improved facilities at the inn and leased the land from Campbell of Glenfalloch.Ransom, p.97 Mails, goods and passengers were transported and stagecoaches ran at first from Inverarnan to Killin and Ballachulish, later also running to Inverness, Aberfeldy, Oban and Crieff.Arrochar & Tarbert Heritage Site Construction and infrastructure Construction started in 1842; however due to very wet weather and severe winters with heavy snows, the canal was not completed until 1844, despite being only 530 yards or 485 metres long with no locks.Canmore Inverarnan Canal site The turning basin at New Garabal had a short landing stage and was only around 300 yards or 274 metres south of the inn.Secret Scotland - Lost Canals A lade or channel from the Allt Arnan Burn is shown supplying the turning basin and the more recent incursion of this burn into the canal area is in this general area.Canmore Inverarnan Canal site Brick work is mentioned as being in good condition on the embankments,Graham, p.35 although these are no longer visible (datum 2016). It is not clear whether ships were charged for the use of the canal. Steamers The Drovers Inn at Inverarnan. The Loch Lomond was the first steamboat to navigate the River Falloch and the Inverarnan Canal, and in 1844 Inverarnan and the canal were fully advertised and the regular services to the New Garabal pier at Inverarnan were fully established. The steamer Water Witch is recorded to have used the canal.Arrochar & Tarbert Heritage SiteThe Loch Lomond Steamers It was possible at the time to reach Glasgow from Oban in a day by coach, steamer and train.Thomas Ransom states that the first company, in which the marquis had shares, to use the canal was the 'New Lochlomond Steam Company' which used the 'Water Witch'. The steamer ran all year round although only weekly during the winter and passengers using the coach services to Killin and Fort William could claim a special reduced fare.Ransom, p.98 Adverts made great play on the convenience of using the canal.Ransom, p.98 Decline The canal water levels were too low at times, and the Garabal basin and entrance from the River Falloch were prone to the accumulation of gravel. Competition between steamer companies had always been a problem, although by 1845 the New Lochlomond Steamboat Company and the Lochlomond Steamboat Company had merged;Ransom, p.99 however the opening in 1870 of the Callander and Oban Railway as far as Killin ended the through services to the north via Loch Lomond, as it was more convenient for passengers to board stagecoaches at Glenoglehead or Tyndrum.Arrochar & Tarbert Heritage SiteRansom, p.103 It is unclear when steamers finally ceased to travel as far as Inverarnan Harbour basin, as the general term \\"Head of Loch Lomond\\" was often used in published timetables.Arrochar & Tarbert Heritage Site Remnants The canal itself remains intact and water filled although overhung by trees. The harbour and turning basin have been filled in with gravel deposits carried in by the Allt Arnan Burn that has broken through into it. Route The New Garabal Basin. The Inverarnan terminus (NN319182) was a boat turning circle at Garabal, close to the Inverarnan Inn (NN318184), now the Drovers Inn. From the basin the canal followed a near-straight southward course between the twisting course of the Allt Arnan Burn on the western side and the bends of the Falloch to the east. Following dredging the teamers could reach the old Garabal landing via the River Falloch when the water levels were high enough and other conditions such as current and wind speed were appropriate.Arrochar & Tarbert Heritage SiteRansom, p.97 Micro history In 1856 the Inspector of Steam Vessels decreed that an 'on site' dry dock or slip was required for the appropriate maintenance of Loch Lomond's steamersMany a Slip ..., p.2 and a start was made the same year on a dry dock at the canal basin on the Inverarnan Canal.Many a Slip ..., p.3 Land at the right price and at a suitable location may have influenced this unlikely choice; however after a month or two's work the plan was scrapped and Luss was chosen instead.Many a Slip ..., p.4 The canal was the only canal ever built in the historic Breadalbane area.Canmore Inverarnan Canal site The quarter of a mile long Inchfad Canal was built on the Loch Lomond island of that name in the 19th century to serve the distillery that had been legally established there.Ransom, p.53 In 1880–81 a bridge across the River Falloch near Ardlui was planned and construction started; however a group led by the Earl of Breadalbane and others was able to stop the work on the grounds that it would prevent the Loch Lomond Steamboat Company's vessels from travelling up the Falloch to Inverarnan, even though regular services had ceased a decade or so before. The unfinished bridge is still recognisable as two large stone pillars.Arrochar & Tarbert Heritage SiteRansom, p.103 See also *Canals of the United Kingdom *History of the British canal system References ;Notes ;Sources * Graham, Duncan (2011).

Jewell was approached in a bar in northern Mexico near the border with the United States, and after being offered marijuana which he declined to buy, was asked if he would drive a car across the border for $100. The car was stopped at customs and marijuana was found in the car in a compartment that Jewell had noticed but not inspected. To be found guilty the law required that he have knowledge of marijuana being in the car. The trial court instructed the jury that the \\"government can complete their burden of proof by proving... if the defendant was not actually aware... his ignorance... was solely and entirely a result of his having made a conscious purpose to and disregard the nature of that which was in the vehicle.\\" The appellate court wrote, \\"deliberate ignorance and positive knowledge are equally culpable... one 'knows' facts of which he is less than absolutely certain. To act 'knowingly', therefore, is not necessarily to act only with positive knowledge, but also to act with awareness of the high probability of the fact in question... 'knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he actually believes that it does not exist.\\" References Category:1976 in United States case law Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit cases ","title":"United States v.

The OECD data of 2016 gives Denmark a Gini coefficient of 0.249, below the OECD average of 0.315. The OECD in 2013 ranked Denmark with having a 0.254 Gini coefficient, ranking third behind Iceland and Norway respectively as the countries with the lowest income inequality qualifications. The Gini coefficients are measured using a 0–1 calibration where 0 equals complete equality and 1 equals complete inequality. \\"Wage- distributive outcomes\\" and their effect on income equality have been noted since the 1970s and 80s. Denmark, along with other Nordic countries, such as Finland and Sweden, has long held a stable low wage inequality index as well. The scope and strength of Denmark's redistributive system and the latitude of the welfare state are the reasons for Denmark's low levels of inequality. The welfare system, in particular, allows for negligible effects that market income inequality can have on \\"disposable income inequality (i.e. market income after taxes and transfers)\\". The rise in income inequality all over the world, though, has not shielded Denmark and has seen its inequality increase in the same rate as all the other OECD countries, pairing Denmark with the likes of the United States and Canada with their pace in inequality intensification. The global course towards rising income inequality in the rich world and in Denmark has been attributed to an increase in capital incomes, a rising gap in \\"earnings dispersion\\", and structural changes that have taken place within households; the long-term propellant of inequality, though, has been skill-biased technical change. Rising inequality in Denmark can be illustrated by how the boon of GDP growth has gone to households of higher incomes, though the income distribution has been relatively equitably discharged throughout the country from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s. Intergenerational earnings elasticity Economist Miles Corak has documented a relationship called \\"The Great Gatsby Curve\\". In this measure, Corak has been able to plot the positive relationship between intergenerational mobility and inequality, and how this relates to the broader concept of equality of opportunity. Corak has stated that in Nordic countries, like Denmark, there is a statistically weak tie between the economic status and earnings of the parents and their adult children, since less than one-fifth of any economic advantage or disadvantage that a father may have had is passed on to an adult son. This “weak tie” is translated to mean that there is a low intergenerational earnings elasticity in Denmark since there is a high level of social mobility and equality of opportunity. Miles Corak believes that the Great Gatsby Curve should not be treated as a blueprint or model for making economic changes. Also, Corak notes that Denmark may not be the most appropriate model for comparison in analyzing economic policies since it has a small and relatively homogenous population, which is not easily comparable to large and demographically diverse countries such as the United States. The Danish intergenerational elasticity of income is flat across the lower parts of the parental distribution, and then rises at the higher end. This means that being raised by a low-income father contributes to no earnings disadvantage, but being raised by a high-income father confers some advantage. This illustrates that there is still a high and strong transmission of economic status at the top income levels, even in the relatively mobile country of Denmark. Specifically, it is shown that the intergenerational transmission of earnings at the very top is associated with the intergenerational transmission of employers since sons of top-earning fathers are more likely to fall from the top strata if they do not work for the same employer that their father had worked for prior. Educational assortative mating Danish income inequality is relatively low, yet the rate of educational homogamy has declined despite increasing levels of educational attainment. In research done by Richard Breen and Signe Hald Andersen, they have found that in Denmark, with a rather more regulated labor market, the education of an individual is more closely related to his or her income. These researches have found this to be particularly the case for women in Denmark. The authors develop this as a consequence of the highly developed Danish welfare state, and the subsequent high levels of participation of married women in the labour force. Approximately 87% of married women participate in the labour force, and this participation is generally uninterrupted for child- rearing since there are extremely generous parental leave policies, as well as free or highly subsidized child daycare. Denmark presents a unique case since there is an illustrated causal link between the changes in educational assortative mating and earnings or income inequality.  How income inequality relates to happiness  Modern studies have posited a possible link between low levels of income inequality and happiness. Denmark, in terms of happiness, ranks as 1st in the World Happiness Report of 2016, with a score of 7.526. The report remarks that among the factors used in the past in evaluating happiness, incomes, healthy lifestyles and social support have ranked as the highest in their importance. Income inequality, in particular, across various studies have seen a direct correlation with happiness: \\"Individuals tend to declare lower happiness levels when inequality happens to be high...[and there is] strong negative effects of inequality on the happiness of the European poor and leftists\\". Danish society is for the most part of a leftish orientation politically. Documented from 1980–1987, the level of happiness declined as inequality increased in Denmark. Danish society, as well as their European counterparts, perceive high levels of inequality as more egregious than other non-Europeans countries, such as in the United States, for example. As has been remarked, low levels of inequality are aided by government redistribution, which can, in turn, lead to higher levels of happiness. In order to rein in inequality, the redistributive mechanisms of the state need to be strengthened. Denmark and the Nordic countries also have the lowest levels of individual earnings inequality and this is due to the high capacity of the redistributive system. The links between happiness, equality and redistribution need to be explored further, though, as many studies have appeared to contradict a strong correlation between them. Among these studies there is a negative correlation between happiness and income inequality: \\"It seems rather evident that people live happier in the most egalitarian societies and that the differences in happiness will be smaller. Yet in this issue, we have seen that this does not apply to all inequalities and particularly not to income inequality. Income inequality is essentially unrelated to the average happiness of citizens and only modestly related to the dispersion of happiness among them.\\" In the World Happiness Report for Denmark, the authors fashion a new approach where they measure happiness in terms of \\"inequality of well-being\\". The novelty of the approach needs to garner more consensus to add to the research between happiness and inequality. Nonetheless, using this approach, the report found that while income is an important factor, equality of well-being and life satisfaction are better indicators of happiness. Denmark ranks high on life satisfaction and in how they perceive themselves and others to be happy; meaning the inequality of well-being in Denmark is low. Evidence suggests that a relationship may yet exist between income and happiness, but using metrics such as the Gallup World poll, happiness gaps among countries, and in Denmark in particular, may have deeper unknown variables at work that transcend income inequality. General disparities of inequality in Danish society are low and are a part of the broader moral philosophy of egalitarianism that is characteristic of Scandinavia and holds that policymakers be morally impelled to suppress inequality as much as possible. Denmark, in terms of this institutional egalitarianism, has been labelled as having a social-democratic regime of welfare. The substantiality of the welfare state's reach in Denmark concerning income equality has led it to protect its citizens against the worst impact of the market and capitalism's more destabilizing effects. Even amid bad economic conditions in Denmark's past, poverty has lessened and standards of living and equality have increased. The preponderance of the evidence between income inequality and happiness suggests a possible link, but more research is needed for far-ranging conclusions.

Gobi is a small, female border terrier mix dog that began following ultra marathon runner Dion Leonard at the beginning of Stage II of the Gobi Desert Run in China in June 2016.  2016 Gobi Desert Run  Leonard noticed the stray dog at the start of the second day of the race. He did not expect the dog to follow him. The dog ran a 23 mile leg of the race with him. At the end of the day, the dog joined Leonard in his tent. Ultimately, Gobi ran 77 miles of the 155 mile race. In Stage III, Leonard carried Gobi several times through water barriers. Gobi did not run Stages IV and V of the run, as the race had entered the desert where temperatures exceeded 52 °C. After finishing the race, Leonard began a crowd funding campaign to raise £5,000 to bring Gobi back to Edinburgh from China. The campaign ultimately raised over £38,000. Leonard and his wife Lucja committed to donate the extra funds to welfare organizations that care for stray dogs. Before Gobi could begin the quarantine process necessary to enter the UK, Leonard left Gobi in the care of race organisers in Urumqi, while he flew back to the UK to arrange for a leave of absence from his job in Edinburgh. While Leonard was in Edinburgh Gobi went missing, so Leonard immediately flew back to Urumqi, a city of three million people, to find her. With a search party made up of volunteers, Leonard combed the city with reward flyers and social media until the dog was found. Gobi had a deep gash on her head and was limping, but was otherwise unharmed. Leonard used some of the crowd funding money to fly Gobi to Beijing for an operation on her hip, from which she recovered. Leonard has now brought Gobi home to Edinburgh after the four month quarantine in Beijing required by UK law for unregistered strays was completed by January 5,2017.  Media and publications  In October 2016, HarperCollins Publishers announced the expected publication of a trilogy of books about Gobi's and Leonard's journey together. The book titled Finding Gobi, received favourable high praise in Publishers Weekly and other reviews. The paperback version was officially launched in the US on June 1, 2017, and went onto become a New York Times Bestseller at number 3. The hardback version was released in the UK, Australia and New Zealand on June 13, 2017, reaching The Sunday Times Bestseller List. This was followed by a paperback version later released in February 2018 also reaching The Sunday Times Bestseller List. The book for adults is now available in 21 languages: English, Spanish, Dutch, Polish, Italian, Japanese, German, Finnish, Swedish, Danish, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Chinese Traditional, Korean, French, Vietnamese, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Slovene and Russian. A young adult edition and a children's picture book was also released in 2017. The young adult edition book won the 2017 New York City Big Book Award. On March 13, 2017, Twentieth Century Fox announced that it is developing a movie based on Dion Leonard and Gobi's extensive journey together. In June 2020, the podcast This is Love covered Dion and Gobi's story in their episode, \\"Gobi.\\"  Awards  In September 2017, Gobi won the Inspiring Animal Hero Award held at the Grosvenor Hotel in London. The Animal Hero Awards recognise and celebrate the most inspiring examples of bravery, dedication and resilience in the animal world. In June 2020, Gobi won the Shining World Marathon Award from the Supreme Master Ching Hai . The award recognises Gobi's heroic and noble example of unconditional selfless love to humankind.

It has a single spreading, hairy leaf and a single green to apricot-coloured flower. It is a small orchid and difficult to find, even when quite abundant in a particular location. It has a more northerly distribution than subspecies bryceana which grows closer to Albany. Description Caladenia bryceana subsp. cracens is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and about wide. The single flower is borne on a stem high and is long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals are short and spreading. The labellum is green to apricot-coloured, has a red tip and smooth edges. There is a band of calli along the centre of the labellum. It is distinguished from subspecies bryceana by its smaller calli and by its lateral sepals which have their edges rolled under. Flowering occurs between August and early September and is followed by a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia bryceana was first formally described by Richard Rogers in 1914 but in 2001 Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown described two subspecies, including subspecies cracens and the description of the two subspecies was published in Nuytsia.

She was born in Nagano, Japan before moving to the United States at an age of 16. She has received many fellowships including the New York Foundation for the Arts Playwriting Fellowship, the Rockefeller Bellagio Residency Fellowship, and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Fellowship at Harvard University. Her plays have been published by Seagull Books and NoPassport Press in two collections: Thousand Years Waiting and Other Plays and America Dreaming and Other Plays. She was a resident playwright at the New Dramatists and is a playwright-in-residence at Bard College. Early life and career Miyagawa moved to the United States with the intention to learn English for only one year but ended up staying permanently. When she first moved by herself to upstate New York as a teenager, Miyagawa said she had difficulty making friends at school and assimilating into American culture. She stated that at the beginning of her life in America, “For years to come, I would cut myself off from Japan. My language skills deteriorated...I had no contact with its culture”. Now, she describes her identity as a “hybrid of acquired American beliefs and imagined Japanese sentiments”. She became a U.S citizen in 1993. Miyagawa earned her Masters of Fine Arts degree at Brooklyn College. Throughout her career, she has worked with numerous theaters. Miyagawa was a dramaturg for the Berkeley Repertory Theatre and a literary manager at the Arena Stage, Washington, D.C. She also was an Assistant literary manager at Actors Theatre of Louisville in Kentucky. Other notable places she has worked with include NYU Tisch School of the Arts graduate program, American Conservatory Theater, and the Young Playwrights Festival. At the New York Theatre Workshop, she was an artistic associate where she was the dramaturg for Joanna Akalaitis, 5-time Obie Award- winning theatre director. At The Public Theater, Miyagawa established and taught the Asian American Playwrights Lab. From 1998-2009, she was the founding co-artistic director of the Crossing Jamaica Avenue theatre company. She is a 2013 alumnus playwright of the New Dramatists. Currently, Miyagawa is a faculty member of Theatre and Performance at Bard College. She lives in New York City and is married to Hap Tivey, a New York-based installation artist. Recurring themes Miyagawa’s works are known for their themes of exploring memory and finding identity. She said once in an interview, “I believe everything we know about ourselves is entirely based on memory—history, science, art, religion are all constructs of human memory.” Her plays are often written in fluid time and space, rather than in a traditional linear timeline. Many of her works draw from Japanese literature and art forms for inspiration and also employ characters that are ghosts. Her works have explored a variety of issues, such as the interactions between Eastern and Western cultures, feminism, drug addiction, and the death penalty. Play productions America Dreaming (1995) was the first play written by Chiori Miyagawa. It was produced by the Music-Theatre Group and Vineyard Theatre. The play follows the story of an Asian American woman, Yuki, who travels back in time, only to discover that history has been distorted so that certain events, such as the Vietnam War and the imprisonment of Japanese Americans in World War II, did not occur in the memory of Americans. It also is a love story that explores the dynamic between Eastern and Western cultures in the past and the present. America Dreaming received a Drama Desk Award Nomination in 1994. The New York Times described the play as, “an impressionistic music-theater piece exploring the collision of Eastern and Western cultures, that notion of happily-ever-after assimilation was always a myth.” Nothing Forever & Yesterday’s Window (1996) were produced at the New York Theatre Workshop. Nothing Forever is a one-act play about an Asian American woman's memory. Yesterday’s Window is a play about a woman and her imaginary daughter. The two pieces are meant to be companions and can use the same actors. Firedance (1997), produced by Voice & Vision Theater, is a love story between a waitress in NYC who meets a stranger who claims to be haunted by a shape-shifting ghost. Backstage praised Miyagawa’s writing, “…the playwright takes the story far beyond such limitations of time and place…Given the playwright’s poetic language and imagery, the drama has reverberations which reach back into history and myth.” Jamaica Avenue (1998) was produced by the New York International Fringe Festival. It is a story of drug addiction centered around a man, a ghost who comes back a woman, and a woman who becomes a ghost. The play was published in Tokens? The NYC Asian American Experience on Stage. Awakening (2000) was produced Performance Space 122 and was based on the 1899 novel The Awakening by Kate Chopin. The play is about the character Edna who is in an unsatisfactory marriage and also includes Kate Chopin as a character. Chiori Miyagawa stated that she was drawn to write an adaption of the novel because of the main character, “All my theatrical characters are outsiders in different ways, because I am one”. Woman Killer (2001), inspired by the 1721 Japanese Bunraku puppet play from Monzemon Chikamatsu called The Woman Killer and The Hell of Oil. Set in Brooklyn in 2001, the story is about a man who kills a neighbor for money and how a family deals with the incident. ITN Review says, “Woman Killer is riveting, compelling theatre, and it raises questions that don't–won't–go away.” Broken Morning (2003) was based on Chiori Miyagawa's interviews with Texas death row inmates. She interviewed not only inmates, but also the guards, family members, and victims surrounding the Huntsville State Prison. It premiered at the HERE Arts Center. Nytheater.com praised the work, “Broken Morning is compelling storytelling of the highest order; it will cause you to ask questions, to challenge your assumptions, and to reconsider what you thought you knew about fundamental social issues.” Leaving Eden (2004) was inspired by the life of Anton Chekhov and revolves around 15 Russian characters who coincidentally all end up at a wedding reception in New York City where Chekov appears. It was produced by the Meadows School of the Arts. “Ms. Miyagawa allows us to retain some belief in the idea of progress, but is skeptical that we will ever get back to any sort of Eden.” says the Dallas Morning News. The Antigone Project (2004)' was created by Miyagawa and Sabrina Peck, and premiered at the Women's Project Theatre. The project is a play in five parts, each part having its own storyline and was written by a different playwright. The five playwrights who wrote in this play are Miyagawa, Tanya Barfield, Karen Hartman, Lynn Nottage and Caridad Svich. Each story is in response to the Patriot Act and incorporates a character named Antigone, inspired by the character written by Sophocles. Red Again is the title of Miyagawa’s piece and is set in the underworld. The story is the final piece in the play and revolves around characters based on Ismene and Haemon (22). The play received mixed reviews from critics. Thousand Years Waiting (2006) is about a woman in present-day New York City reading a memoir of a Japanese woman from a thousand years ago who is reading The Tale of Genji. The play employs Bunkaru dances. The play was co-produced by Crossing Jamaica Avenue and Performance Space 122. Caridad Svich from The Brooklyn Rail says, “Thousand Years Waiting exemplifies Miyagawa’s tender and celebratory quality as a dramatist, and her ability to crystallize dramatic moments with grace.” I Have Been to Hiroshima Mon Amour (2009) was produced at the Voice & Vision Theater at part of the Hiroshima Project at Ohio Theatre. Written as a response to the famous 1959 film Hiroshima mon amour, the play follows three stories taking place at different points in time. The first follows a French actor who falls in love with a man in Hiroshima, the second is about a man’s fiancée who becomes a victim of the bomb, and the third revolves around three students in New york City who watch the 1959 film and argue about it. Miyagawa said she wrote this film because, “I was annoyed by the appropriation of the city’s tragedy by the French female protagonist. How could one person’s loss possibly be thought of as a metaphor for the deaths of one hundred thousand people?”. Martin Harries, a NYU English professor, praises the play, “There are many plays that look like they want to be movies. There are too few that take them on in meaningful, craft, theatrical ways. Here is one.” I Came to Look for You on Tuesday (2013) premiered at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. Miyagawa was inspired to write the play after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami affected her family in Japan. She and the director, Alice Reagan, held salons where people could share their own personal stories of reunion as part of The Tuesday Following. The play follows Maia who was saved by her mother’s sacrifice in a Tsunami and how she reunited with her father who was distraught by her mother’s death. BroadwayWorld.com says, “I Came to Look for You on Tuesday is a surprising and mythical story, by turns poignant and humorous, about our need to reconnect”. The Huffington Post adds, “Overall, this production is creative, engaging, and quite brave.” This Lingering Life (2015) premiered at the Theatre of Yugen. The play was inspired by 14th century Japanese Noh plays, which Miyagawa studied in Japan during her Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Fellowship. The play retells nine ancient Japanese stories with 27 characters, all which have no names. Miyagawa said in an interview that the characters, “they are identified by their types, such as Crazy Woman, Mystical Warrior, Woman with Tragic Hair, and Gangster on the Run, in an attempt to create sympathetic characters without making them into our neighbors.” The play received critical acclaim. The Huffington Post said, “Miyagawa's plays, this one especially, sit somewhere between this world and another world. They also commit so fully to their own aesthetic that I usually find myself pondering the fascinating rules of this alternate existence hours or even days later (this lingering life indeed).” The New Yorker praised the play as” clever, stylish, and often funny”. Other notable works Several of Miyagawa’s plays have been published in two books. Thousand Years Waiting and Other Plays was published by Seagull Books and includes Thousand Years Waiting, Comet Hunter, Leaving Eden, The Awakening, FireDance, Broken Morning, and Red Again. All plays in the book explore the themes of memory and identity. A review from Martin Harris said,\\"Chiori Miyagawa adamantly refuses to provide those signposts that more comforting dramatists leave to reassure audiences. The force of her work lies in its jarring historical and cultural discontinuities, its mixture of brutality and beauty, its disorienting verbal and visual impact.\\" American Dreaming and Other Plays includes Jamaica Avenue, Yesterday’s Window, Antigone’s Red, I Have Been to Hiroshima Mon Amour, and America Dreaming. It was published by NoPassport Press. All plays in the book have some Japanese influence. Miyagawa has written numerous plays that were not put into production, including a Winter’s Captive, Comet Hunter, Leaf, Way to Curaçao, Cute Cats, and Antigone’s Red. Other than writing plays, Miyagawa has also written poetry that has been published in the Asian American Policy Review. She has also written creative nonfiction prose that has been published in Black Warrior Review and Ecotone, a literary journal published by the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. Projects 'The Tuesday Following' was a project created to accompany Miyagawa's play I Came to Look For You On Tuesday. The project consisted of street art installations and reunion salons in New York City that explored reunions after natural disasters and wartime. 'The Dream Act Union' was formed to raise awareness for the DREAM Act, which was a legislative proposal to give legal status to undocumented youth. A group of seven female playwrights including Miyagawa wrote a collective play named Dream Acts as part of the project. 'Hibakusha Stories Arts and Science Initiatives' is an organization that advocates to the young generation to build a nuclear-free world. Miyagawa conducts play-writing workshops with high school students in New York City to respond to the story of Hiroshima survivor Shigeko Sasamori.(34) 'The Hiroshima project' was a project created to accompany I Have Been to Hiroshima Mon Amour. It consisted of the premiere of the play, a screening of White Light/Black Rain: The Destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a series of readings of Japanese plays, and panel discussions regarding the bombings. The project was produced by Voice & Vision Theater and Crossing Jamaica Avenue.

In 1902 Charles Moureu published Notions fondamentales de chimie organique, translated into English as Fundamental principles of organic chemistry (1921). During World War I, Charles Moureu was vice-chairman of France's Committee for Gas Warfare. In this role, he established 16 chemistry laboratories in Paris, supervising their work until 1918. Moureu also became chairman of the Committee of National Defence when it was established in 1925, leading it until his death in 1929. During the war, he researched acrolein and sulfur mustard gas, working with Charles Dufraisse. This work led them to pioneering research into autoxidation and antioxidants. Moureu supported initiatives for international cooperation and standardization among chemists. He was one of the vice- presidents of the Société chimique de France (SCF) in 1910, and the founding President of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) from 1920 to 1922. Education Charles Moureu attended school in Bayonne. At 17, he apprenticed with his older brother, Félix Moureu, in his brother's pharmacy in Biarritz, in preparation for studies in pharmacy. From 1884 to 1891 Moureu studied at the École Supérieure de Pharmacie in Paris. He received the school's Silver Medal in 1886, and both its Gold Medal and the Laillet Prize in 1887. In addition, he interned in the Hôpitaux de Paris from 1886 to 1891, where he was given first place rank of the interns in 1887 and in 1889. Moureu received a degree in 1888 and graduated as a pharmacist first class in 1891, whereupon he was given a position as chief pharmacist of the public asylum of the Seine (des Asiles de la Seine). He remained in this position from 1891 to 1907. This allowed him to continue his research, studying organic chemistry with and Charles Friedel. He received his doctorate in physical sciences in 1893 from the Sorbonne, with the dissertation Contribution à l'étude de l'acide acrylique et de ses dérivés (Contribution to the study of acrylic acid and its derivatives). He obtained his agrégation in 1899. Career Moureu and Charles Dufraisse in their laboratory in Paris From 1907 onward, Charles Moureu was a professor of chemical pharmacy at the École supérieure de Pharmacie in Paris. In 1913 he was named director of the laboratory of hydrological physical chemistry at the École pratique des hautes études. He became a member of the Académie Nationale de Médecine (from 1907), Académie des sciences (from 1911) and Académie nationale de pharmacie (president 1913). After the use of poison gas against French troops in the Second Battle of Ypres on April 22, 1915, Charles Moureu was appointed vice- chairman of France's Committee for Gas Warfare. Moreu headed the Section des produits agressifs (Aggressive Products Section). In this role, he was responsible for 16 chemistry laboratories in Paris, supervising and coordinating their work until 1918. He was also involved in conferences of the allied powers in September 1917, March 1918, and October 1918. In 1917 Charles Moureu was appointed professor of organic chemistry at the Collège de France. Succeeding Émile Jungfleisch, Moureu was the only professor to be appointed to the college during the first world war. Moureu supported initiatives for international cooperation and standardization among chemists. He served as a vice-president of the Société chimique de France (SCF) in 1910. Moureu was active in the restructuring of chemical organizations in 1918-1919. The Allied Conference of Academies formally dissolved the International Association of Chemical Societies (IACS), as of July 22, 1919. Moureu was the founding President of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), holding the position from 1920 to 1922. He also supported the establishment of the Maison de la chimie in Paris as an international center for chemists. In 1921 and 1922, Moureu visited the United States as a scientific expert. In 1921 he was part of a French Mission on Disarmament. In 1922, he visited Washington, D.C. for discussions on the use of gas in warfare. He visited a number of universities in the United States and Canada, and was given an honorary degree by the University of Montreal. Moureu became chairman of the French Committee of National Defence when it was established in 1925, leading it until his death in 1929. Research Moureu was widely respected for his research work. As part of his research on acrylic acid and its derivatives, he was the first to synthesize acrylonitrile in 1893. In addition, he studied acetylene compounds, phenolic compounds, plant essences, and rare gases found in wells and mines. During the war, Moureu researched acrolein and sulfur mustard gas, working with his student Charles Dufraisse. Acrolein was an extremely unstable compound, which tended to polymerize on contact with air. Already familiar with the preparation of acrolein, Moureu and Dufraisse were able to develop a way to stabilize it after carefully studying the processes by which it altered. Their work led to the use of acrolein and later benzyl iodide in weapons. Their research also had great impact and long-lasting significance after the war. It was first published in the Bulletin of the Chemical Society of France in 1922. The autoxidation reactions that Moureu and Dufraisse described occur spontaneously in most organic products in the presence of oxygen from the air and certain catalysts. Autoxidation affects virtually all living organisms. Moureu identified catalysts that could trigger such reactions, and other compounds that could slow or inhibit such reactions. He called the inhibitors \\"antioxygens\\", now known as \\"antioxidants\\". Moureu is best known for this pioneering research. It has led to the use of antioxidants in the rubber and vegetable oil industries, and to widespread applications in foods and medicines. Antioxidants are added to slow the spoiling of foods and the aging of rubber. Moureu's work with sulfur mustard also became important after the war, as later researchers realized that some of the chemicals that were in mustard gas could be used as anti-cancer drugs, suppressing the division and proliferation of blood and bone marrow cells in leukaemia and lymphatic tumours.

Sam Suchmann and Mattie Zufelt star as half-brothers who must stop Satan from ruining their spring break.  Premise  After failing to steal their magic powers, Satan kills the mothers of two half-brothers shortly after they are born. Twenty years later, the brothers must use their powers to stop Satan and his zombie minions from ruining their spring break.  Cast  * Sam Suchmann as Sam * Mattie Zufelt as Mattie * Madeline Brumby as Nikki * Justine S Harrison as Elizabeth/Mrs. Fox * Allison Maier as A. J. * Joseph Turner as Frakenzombie *Johnny Collins as the Devil Pauly D appears in a cameo near the end.  Production  Sam Suchmann and Mattie Zufelt, both of whom have Down syndrome, met at the Special Olympics. Sam's older brother, Jesse, said their families initially viewed the friends' enthusiasm for a film as a phase the two would eventually outgrow. When they did not, Jesse investigated further, finding that they had written a notebook full of scenes, including storyboards. Jesse initially considered shooting the film do-it-yourself style but was impressed enough with their work that he took the film to Kickstarter, where it received $68,000 in funding. Taking the position of producer, Jesse brought in director Bobby Carnevale, whom he had been friends with in high school. Filming took place over 16 days in Providence, Rhode Island. The Kickstarter campaign and resulting publicity resulted in increased interest in the film, and industry veterans like Farrelly brothers visited the set. Casting involved diverse groups of people. Some of the extras are friends on the autism spectrum or with Downs, and some auditioned after discovering the project. Other talent came from Atlanta, where director Carnevale had contacts. Pauly D, a hero to Mattie, accepted a cameo role after the friends insisted that he be approached. Jesse said the film was Sam and Mattie's project, and they were not simply helped by a professional film crew. A sequel is planned.  Release  Spring Break Zombie Massacre premiered on July 7, 2016, in Providence, Rhode Island. It later played at the Telluride Film Festival in October 2016.  Reception  Steve Hartman of CBS News called it \\"really gross in parts, terribly offensive in others and completely ludicrous throughout\\", concluding that it is a future cult film.

Building Floor Plan  The San Diego Police Headquarters, Jail & Courts is an institutional complex of interconnected spaces arranged in a rectangle around an interior courtyard. Heights vary from single story to three stories with an accent tower reaching 68 feet. The complex is on a 4.2 acre site, that includes a front parking lot and interior courtyard with a remnant ornamental landscape. The architectural style is expressed as Spanish Colonial Revival in variations ranging from Churrigueresque to Pueblo Deco. The complex is presented in five basic volume units that depart one from another in ornament and detail as well as in function but circulate within as a singular facility. The five units are; the Garage, the Assembly/Gymnasium area, the Courts, the Jail, and the front administrative public area with its arched entry and signature tower. Each unit is unique enough to stand alone, yet, as a composite create a highly distinct complex. All foundations, floors and walls are reinforced concrete construction. All exterior ornament is precast concrete. Exterior finishes are rough trowel stucco and finished plaster. Roof treatments are Mission style red tile or composition shingles. Interior historic courtyard elements, fountain, seating and the main planter bed have been removed, however, the ornamental paving is in very good condition. The horticultural element has been compromised due to discontinued irrigation. Minor modifications were made to the exterior and interior over a forty eight year period of occupation, however, since the site had only one user, the San Diego Police Headquarters, the entire property has remained very much intact.

On July 7, after Slavyansk completely passed under the control of Ukrainian soldiers, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Arsen Avakov and his deputy Vasyl Pascal () who arrived in the city. Natalia Bradarskaya asked them to help her to find the missing. On July 14, Anton Gerashchenko said that exhumation of bodies from the mass grave was conducted, and that the bodies had signs of tortures and abuses.МВС України заявляє, що виявило могилу двох замучених бойовиками священиків зі Слов'янська // РБК-УкраЇна, 14.07.2014. Among the found 14 bodies, were the bodies of Pavenko brothers and V. Bradarsky, identified by remnants of their clothing. The severely charred body of Velichko was identified later by DNA profiling. On July 20, after identification procedures were completed, the bodies were reburied at the site of their discovery - near a children's hospital.В Славянске похоронили протестантов, захваченных в церкви после богослужения и расстрелянных боевиками ДНР.  Media coverage  On July 15, 2014, the English-language service of the Russian state radio station Voice of Russia published an article, citing Anton Gerashchenko, in which they claimed that the two priests and two sons of one of the priests were killed for helping the rebels, and that the murderers were Ukrainian nationalists. Journalist of The New York Times, Andrew Higgins, wrote that it was believed that the priests were pro-Russian and due to their affiliation with the Russian Orthodox Church were believed to be interested in uniting the Slavic lands of the Middle Ages, which included western Russia, the Ukraine, and Belarus. There was evidence that they helped support the rebels, including storing ammunition in the church. On the other hand, Christian Science Monitor newspaper correspondent Scott Peterson said that the killers were not Ukrainians, but were pro-Russian separatists.  Causes of the execution  According to Anton Gerashchenko, the killed men were accused of sending food to checkpoints of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) and the National Guard, as well as possibly informing the Ukrainian military about insurgent activities.Обнаружены изувеченные тела двух священников из Славянска.

Assault & Recovery  On 7 March 2002, at 16 years old, Barker was assaulted by her 20-year-old boyfriend. They had been dating since Angela was 14, and he had previously assaulted her multiple times. His attacks culminated that day in 2002, after Barker refused to date him after they had previously broken up. He beat her, and Barker was found by a passerby. After the assault, Angela's family was told that she would remain in a vegetative state forever. After the attack, she spent 8 weeks in the hospital, five months in rehabilitative therapy, and three years in a rehabilitation hospital. She now uses a wheelchair, and was left with severe brain injury and without the ability to talk. After five years, she regained the ability to talk. Barker does not recall the 12 months before the attack, and her memory has only recovered to somewhere within thirteen and fifteen. Her former boyfriend later turned himself in, and was sentenced to serve a minimum of seven-and-a-half years in prison.  Activism  As of 2011, Angela has shared her story with over 10,000 teens across Australia and internationally. In 2007, Angela told the story of her assault in a special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to children.

However, this decision shows that the arrangements may give rise to an unexpected VAT liability for joint contracts of employment.Thirdsector.co.uk, (2014). VAT fears over joint contracts. [online] Available at: http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/vat-fears-joint-contracts/finance/article/1042175 [Accessed 30 Oct. 2014]. Case information The tribunal met on 26, 27 and 29 July 2010.CGI Group (Europe) Ltd v Revenue & Customs [2010 UKFTT 396 (TC) (20 August 2010)], accessed 29 October 2016 The case of CGI Group (Europe) Limited demonstrated that, where an arrangement is structured in order to obtain a particular VAT treatment, it is important to ensure both the contractual documentation and the substance and reality of the arrangement support this treatment. Cox, an insurance company, outsourced the running of its IT department to CGI. Under the outsourcing arrangements with CGI, the staffs became jointly employed by both Cox and CGI and a master services agreement was also made between them. As Cox was an insurance company it had (like many other financial institutions) a limited ability to recover input VAT incurred on fees paid for outsourcing services. CGI believed that the money paid for the shared wages would be excluded from VAT as the employees were under a joint employment contract. There were also a number of detailed arrangements regarding the employees under the master services agreement, including that CGI agreed not to take certain actions in relation to the transferred employees for a period of six months and to indemnify Cox in respect of all liabilities relating to them from the transfer date. The decision Even though the Tribunal judge accepted that legally the employees were jointly employed by CGI and Cox, the staff in reality were working for CGI only. CGI had a high degree of control of the employees and this overrode the joint employment contract. Cox still had a right to control the employees. Therefore the VAT was expected to be paid in full. From this case, the employers should to be more cautious under joint employment circumstances, including the terms on the agreement and the arrangement of an employee between two employers, in order to minimize the risk of VAT being applied. It is also a reminder that the courts will look beyond the contract to decide the correct VAT analysis. Ogletree Deakins, Betsy Johnson (2013). Yours, mine, or ours?

Manerplaw was the headquarters of two armed opposition groups, the Karen National Union (KNU) and the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF). The final military offensive by the Tatmadaw was met with little resistance, after the leadership of the DKBA provided the Tatmadaw with information on KNLA positions and tactics in Manerplaw.  Background  The Karen people of Kayin State (also known as Karen State) in eastern Myanmar (also known as Burma) are the third largest ethnic group in Myanmar, consisting of 7% of the country's total population, and have fought for independence and self-determination since 1949. The initial aim of the KNU was to obtain independence for the Karen people. However, in 1976 they instead began to call for a federal union in Myanmar with fair Karen representation, and the self-determination of the Karen people. Up until the fall of Manerplaw, the village had been subjected to several military offensives by the Tatmadaw, and the surrounding area was the location of several alleged human right abuses by the military junta, including forced labour and extrajudicial punishment.  Prelude  In December 1994, Buddhist and Christian factions of the KNU began to have disagreements on the construction of pagodas in Manerplaw. U Thuzana, a Karen Buddhist monk who ordered the construction and was then a member of the KNU, revolted against the organisation with others who were dissatisfied with the group's Christian-dominated leadership. On 11 December 1994, the KNLA clashed with Buddhist dissidents in Manerplaw. This ultimately led to a split in the KNU and the establishment of the DKBA on 21 December 1994. U Thuzana later brokered a deal with Major General Maung Hla, the southeastern regional commander of the Myanmar Army, and attempted to persuade Karen villagers to evacuate to DKBA protected refugee camps. U Thuzana also attempted to persuade Buddhist soldiers of the KNLA to defect to the DKBA and assist the Tatmadaw.  Tatmadaw/DKBA offensive  In January 1995, 4,000 to 10,000 Tatmadaw and DKBA troops advanced towards Manerplaw, capturing several nearby villages. The Min Yaw Kee ridge, which in 1992 had been fiercely defended by the KNLA, was captured without a single shot being fired. Soldiers from the DKBA assisted the Tatmadaw by providing information on KNLA positions and guiding them through the jungle to Manerplaw. As the Tatmadaw and DKBA approached Manerplaw, an estimated 9,000 to 10,000 civilians fled from the village and its surrounding area, including from nearby refugee camps. When the Tatmadaw and DKBA finally moved into Manerplaw on 27 January 1995, the leadership of the KNU ordered their soldiers to retreat and to raze the village; the roughly 3,000 inhabitants of Manerplaw had already been evacuated by then.  Aftermath  Most of the refugees who fled the fighting headed towards refugees camps in Thailand, near the Myanmar–Thailand border. After capturing Manerplaw, the Tatmadaw advanced towards nearby villages it previously could not reach, eventually reaching the southern KNU stronghold of Kawmoora, which fell to Tatmadaw soldiers on 21 February 1995. A direct consequence of the fall of Manerplaw and its aftermath was that the KNU lost most of its income derived from local tax revenue, logging deals and cross-border trade, as the Tatmadaw captured several border towns.

History According to Binoy Ghosh, Narajole’s ruling clan, belonging to the Sadgop community, was founded by Uday Narayan Ghosh. His great grandson, Raja Kartickram, was honoured with the title ‘Roy’ by the Mughal emperor. The family used the title till in the eighth generation, when Raja Balwant was honoured with the ‘Khan’ title for some praise-worthy achievement. Thereafter, they used that title.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part II, 1976 edition, pages 86-90 , Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata. Raja Ajit Singh, the last king of the Midnapore zamindari, with its headquarters at Karnagarh, died childless in 1749. They were close to the rulers of Narajole. His two queens, who inherited the Midnapore zamindari, ran into great difficulties during the Chuar rebellion and sought the support of Raja Trilochan Khan of Narajole. After Raja Trilochan Khan’s death, the responsibility of looking after the Midnapore zamindari and Rani Shiromani of Karnagarh (the other queen had died by then) fell successively on Raja Motiram and Raja Sitaram. Rani Shiromani loved Sitaram’s eldest son, Anandalal, as her own son and handed over the entire Midnapore zamindari to him in 1800. Unfortunately, Anandalal died childless and as per his wishes his brothers became the owners – Nandalal Khan of Narajole zamindari and Mohanlal Khan of Midnapore zamindari. Geography=Area overview Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, scholar, social reformer and a key figure of the Bengal Renaissance, was born at Birsingha on 26 September 1820. Ghatal subdivision, shown in the map alongside, has alluvial soils. Around 85% of the total cultivated area is cropped more than once.It has a density of population of 1,099 per km2, but being a small subdivision only a little over a fifth of the people in the district reside in this subdivision. 14.33% of the population lives in urban areas and 86.67% lives in the rural areas. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. Gram panchayats Villages in Nij Narajole gram panchayat are: Bachhra Kundu, Bali Pata, Balluri, Bara Mara, Chandipur, Danikola, Dubrajpur, Gobra Kundu, Haja Kundu, Harirajpur, Kalyanpur, Kanta Darja, Kismat Narajole, Nij Narajole, Rai Kundu, Ramdaspur, Simana, Singaghai and Supapursuri. The palace Narajole’s Rajbari, Garh Narajole, was spread over 500 bighas and divided in to the inner and outer segments. The outer segment housed the poorer people, amongst whom were some painter families, who had survived the travails of life and in 1970 continued to produce dolls, painted pots and decorative wall plates. The inner segment was an ‘Indrapuri’ (the palace of heaven) consisting of splendid buildings (including the three-storeyed palace) temples, gardens etc. The large entrance gate lead to a spacious garden, with a temple of the family deity, Sitaramjiu. The drawing rooms were filled with selected country made and foreign showpieces and pictures of the royalty. On the way out, one again got to see a mix of gardens, ponds and residential quarters, with some Shiva temples nearby. There were many other temples. On the southern side were rangmahal, rasmancha and dolmancha. The Hawa Mahal (ballroom) is located on a 60 bigha land, surrounded by a parikha. Lankagarh, about a kilometer from main Rajbari houses fifty four temples. A 10-bigha plot was donated for a degree college. The former Rajas of Narajole had a patriotic mindset. Special mention may be made of Raja Narendralal Khan and Raja Debendralal Khan. Almost all national, leaders in the pre-independence era, had visited Narajole. Demographics As per 2011 Census of India Nij Narajol had a total population of 4,085 of which 2,089 (51%) were males and 1,996 (49%) were females. Population below 6 years was 492.

(October 11, 1920 – October 20, 2012) was an American scientist who studied chemical kinetics and atmospheric chemistry. After beginning his academic career at Stanford University, he was a faculty member and administrator at the University of California, Berkeley for nearly 35 years. In 1971, Johnston authored a paper suggesting that environmental pollutants could erode the ozone layer. Johnston was elected to several scholarly organizations, including the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He won the National Medal of Science in 1997. Early life Johnston was born in Woodstock, Georgia. His father, Smith Lemon Johnston, helped to run his family's general store. They lived on a Georgia farm when Harold Johnston was young. In the early 1930s, Johnston contracted rheumatic fever and the illness affected his heart. A physician uncle told Johnston's father not to send Johnston to college because the young man would not survive long enough to get much use out of the education. Johnston said he later learned that the disease was associated with an average survival period of fifteen years at the time. Going to college at Emory University with aspirations of becoming a journalist, Johnston soon realized that the U.S. was headed toward World War II and that a science degree would serve him better. Johnston completed an undergraduate degree in chemistry and a minor in English literature. Johnston received a Ph.D. in chemistry and physics from the California Institute of Technology. As a doctoral student, Johnston focused on the interaction of ozone and the pollutant nitrogen dioxide. While at Caltech, he joined in a secret defense project that involved protecting the country against the use of gas warfare. Career From 1947 to 1956, Johnston taught at Stanford University. While there, he was named to the editorial board of the Journal of the American Chemical Society. In the early 1950s, Johnston furthered the air pollution work of Arie Jan Haagen-Smit by showing that free-radical reactions underlay the photochemical process leading to smog. Throughout his career, much of Johnston's work involved understanding the kinetics of nitrogen oxides. He returned to Caltech as a faculty member for a year in 1956. From 1957 until his retirement in 1991, Johnston was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. From 1966 to 1970, Johnston was the dean of Berkeley's College of Chemistry. Johnston mentored undergraduate and graduate students, including future Nobel Prize winner Dudley R. Herschbach and future National Medal of Science winner Susan Solomon. He also made large contributions to the theory of elementary chemical reactions. He wrote a popular textbook on reaction rate theory. Johnston became best known for his work related to ozone. In a 1971 paper, he posited that pollution from supersonic aircraft in the stratosphere could deplete the ozone layer. Because it suggested for the first time that human activity could impact the integrity of the environment, Johnston's ozone research received some criticism and resistance. However, two environmental regulatory programs were formed as a result of his findings – the Climatic Impact Assessment Program (CIAP) and the Stratosphere Protection Program. Honors and awards Johnston was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1965. He was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1981. In 1972, Johnston was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He won the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement in 1983. He received the NAS Award for Chemistry in Service to Society in 1993. Four years later, Bill Clinton awarded him the National Medal of Science. In 1998, Johnston received the Roger Revelle Medal from the American Geophysical Union. Later life Even in the late 1990s, Johnston said that he had lived most of his life with \\"a moving 10-year life expectancy\\" because of his early bout with rheumatic fever, but he remained in good health until he was more than 90 years old. He died in 2012; he was 92. Johnston was survived by his wife of 64 years, Mary Ella, and their four children, as well as several grandchildren and great- grandchildren.

The son of a Turkic general of Caliph al-Mu'tasim, al-Fath was raised at the caliphal palace alongside the future al-Mutawakkil and adopted by al-Mu'tasim at age seven. With the accession of al-Mutawakkil, he occupied a series of official posts, including governor of Egypt and the Syrian provinces, but his power stemmed mainly from his close relationship to al-Mutawakkil, whose main adviser and confidante he was. A well-educated man and ardent bibliophile, al- Fath was himself a writer and a patron of writers, and assembled a large library at his palace at Samarra. He was assassinated by the Turkic guard alongside al-Mutawakkil. Origin and early life Al-Fath was the son of Khaqan ibn Urtuj, a Turkic leader related to the ruling family of Ferghana. Coming from his homeland in Central Asia to serve in the caliphal army, Urtuj had risen to become one of the main commanders—alongside Ashinas, Wasif al- Turki, and al-Afshin—of the Turkish guard established by Caliph al-Mu'tasim (). Al-Fath was born around 817/8, as he was likely of age with the future al- Mutawakkil, along with whom he was raised and educated since infancy, and whose closest companion and confidante he became. At the age of seven, al-Fath was adopted by al-Mu'tasim. Indeed, as the historian Matthew Gordon comments, \\"a range of anecdotal evidence suggests that al-Fath and al-Mutawakkil were inseparable\\". Of his brothers, the most notable was Muzahim, who became a military officer and ended up as governor of Egypt, where he was succeeded by his son Ahmad. Role in government Despite his prominence, few biographical details are known about al-Fath. Yaqut al-Hamawi reports that his career in government began under al-Mu'tasim and al-Wathiq (), but mentions no specific position. After the accession of al-Mutawakkil, al-Fath played a major role in the government, more by his status as the Caliph's chief adviser than by virtue of any official posts he held. Yaqut reports that he served as personal secretary to the Caliph, and was in charge of his official seal. Ibn Taghribirdi claims that he was in charge of the dīwān al-kharāj in 847/8, while both he and al-Kutubi report that he was also vizier. The latter is unlikely, since the position was occupied for most of al-Mutawakkil's reign by Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan (no relation). In al-Fath served as al- Mutawakkil's chief of intelligence in Samarra, while in 856/7 and again in 860/1 he was appointed temporarily as governor of Egypt; on the latter occasion he may have acted as an envoy rather than governor, since al-Kindi categorically states that the governors of Egypt at the time represented the prince al-Muntasir, who was the nominal governor of the province. In 858, following al-Mutawakkil's short-lived attempt to transfer his capital to Damascus, al-Fath was also appointed governor of Syria. Here too his activity in that capacity is obscure, but there is some evidence that points to him taking an active role in the affairs of the province. Succession dispute and assassination Al-Mutawakkil had appointed his oldest son, al-Muntasir, as his heir in 849/50, but slowly had shifted his favour to his second son, al- Mu'tazz. Al-Fath and the vizier Ubayd Allah encouraged the Caliph in his intention to replace al-Muntasir, and appear to have been backed by the traditional Abbasid elites as well. Conversely, al-Muntasir was backed by the Turkic and Maghariba guard troops. In late autumn 861, matters came to a head: in October, al-Mutawakkil ordered the estates of the Turkic general Wasif to be confiscated and handed over to al-Fath. Feeling backed into a corner, the Turkic leadership began a plot to assassinate the Caliph. They were soon joined, or at least had the tacit approval, of al-Mustansir, who smarted from a succession of humiliations: on 5 December, on the recommendation of al-Fath and Ubayd Allah, he was bypassed in favour of al-Mu'tazz for leading the Friday prayer at the end of Ramadan, while three days later, when al- Mutawakkil was feeling ill and chose al-Mustansir to represent him on the prayer, once again Ubayd Allah intervened and persuaded the Caliph to go in person. Even worse, according to al-Tabari, on the next day al-Mutawakkil alternately vilified and threatened to kill his eldest son, and even had al- Fath slap him on the face. With rumours circulating that Wasif and the other Turkish leaders would be rounded up and executed on 12 December, the conspirators decided to act. According to al-Tabari, a story later circulated that al-Fath and Ubayd Allah were forewarned of the plot by a Turkic woman, but had disregarded it, confident that no-one would dare carry it out. On the night of 10/11 December, about one hour after midnight, the Turks burst in the chamber where the Caliph and al-Fath were having supper. Al-Fath was killed trying to protect the Caliph, who was killed next. Al-Muntasir, who now assumed the caliphate, initially claimed that al-Fath had murdered his father, and that he had been killed after; within a short time, however, the official story changed to al-Mutawakkil choking on his wine. The murder of al- Mutawakkil began the tumultuous period known as \\"Anarchy at Samarra\\", which lasted until 870 and brought the Abbasid Caliphate to the brink of collapse. Cultural Activity Thoroughly assimilated into the Arabic culture, with an \\"impressive command of Arabic\\", al-Fath was a prominent member of Samarra's literary circle, and notable as a patron of many writers and poets, such as the writer al-Buhturi, or the historian al-Tha'labi. Perhaps his most notable protégé was Abu Uthman Amr ibn Bahr al-Jahiz, who dedicated his work Fi manaqib al-Turk (\\"On the Merits of the Turks\\") to his benefactor. Al-Fath was himself an author, but of his works only the titles of three books and 13 verses have survived. He also assembled a large library, which contained many philosophical works, and which was frequented by many scholars of the time; the historian Hugh N. Kennedy calls him \\"the greatest bibliophile of his day\\". His palace in Samarra, built by his father, later became a caliphal residence, known as Jawsaq al-Khaqani.

Service history Suez Maru sailed on 25 November 1943 with 547 POWs (414 British and 133 Dutch) from Ambon bound for Surabaya. The POWs were all sick men from the work-camps on the Moluccas and Ambon. About twenty men were on stretchers. There were also around two hundred sick and wounded Japanese soldiers on board. On 29 November 1943, near Kangean Island east of Madoera Island, the ship was torpedoed by , unaware of the presence of Allied POWs. About half of the POWs drowned in the aft hold of the ship, but about 250 - 280 escaped from the holds and jumped into the water. Nearly four hours later the escort ship, minesweeper No.12 returned from dropping depth charges near Bonefish, the minesweeper only picked up Japanese survivors, pushing POWs back into the water if they tried to climb aboard. Then Captain Kawano Osumu, master of W-12, discussed with the POW transport commander Lt. Masaji Koshio (aka Masaji Iketani) what should be done with the surviving POWs. Koshio/Iketani informed him that Major General Sanso Anami had told him that in the event of the ship being torpedoed that the POWs should be shot. Captain Kawano quickly agreed ordering gunnery officer Yatsuka to arrange twenty soldiers with rifles on deck and two machine-guns on the lower bridge, whilst other crew pointed out survivors amongst the wreckage. The gunnery crew then machine-gunned all surviving POWs in the water. All were killed. There were also some three Japanese casualties which went down with Suez Maru. The minesweeper No.12 report lodged at Batavia on 3 December 1943 stated that the POWs were kept in the holds and the hatches locked and stated that they had all drowned on the sinking, and made no mention of the war crime. This war crime was extensively investigated in 1949, following its reporting by one of the c.200 wounded Japanese soldiers aboard the Suez Maru that day, a Yoshio Kashiki. Dozens of first hand accounts and sworn statements were taken from twenty-two individuals; suspects and eye witnesses, Kawano and Iketani being arrested. A memorial to the 414 British POWs aboard Suez Maru who were murdered by the Japanese was dedicated on 29 November 2013 at the National Memorial Arboretum, Alrewas, Staffordshire. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g186376-d1379697-i85874696-National_Memorial_Arboretum- Lichfield_Staffordshire_England.htmlhttp://www.thenma.org.uk/ A detailed account of the ship, the sinking and subsequent atrocity, along with the trial documents and descriptions can be found in the book The Suez Maru Atrocity- Justice Denied!. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Suez-Maru-atrocity-Japanese-hell- ship/dp/0954272501/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1500031868&sr;=8-1&keywords;=the+suez+maru+atrocity And a further book on the atrocity and subsequent war crime investigation can be found in the book Unwritten Letters to Spring Street.

David Herron. June 11, 2015 There are also other challenges to hydraulic fracturing in Ukraine, such as a lack of a proper regulatory framework for its development, opposition of major EU partners to hydraulic fracturing which may seek to influence Ukraine (France for example has an outright ban). Ukraine's shale gas reserves are also deeper than those in the United States, and thus production is bound to be more expensive, which may make it cost-prohibitive, depending on the prevailing market prices for gas.American Bar Association: Ukraine’s energy crisis may invite hydraulic fracturing and regulatory uncertainty Uncertainty Constitutionally, Ukraine's natural resources belong to the people, with government acting as a trustee. A private investor needs to execute a production-sharing agreement, but is never entitled to 100% of its production, as it has to be shared with the state. The level of potential public opposition to hydraulic fracturing also creates uncertainty.

June 1882Antonius Lux: Große Frauen der Weltgeschichte. Tausend Biographien in Wort und Bild. , Munich 1963, p. 391.) was a German opera singer and stage actress who became known as a lover of Arthur Schopenhauer.  Life  Caroline Richter came to Berlin around 1819 as a chorister at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden. It was there that she met Arthur Schopenhauer, probably in 1820 or spring 1821, when he lectured in Berlin. The abrupt and fading relationship between the two lasted about ten years. The \\"eternal bachelor\\" Schopenhauer, however, mistrusted her possible motives, which together with worries about her health and jealousy of other lovers of the singer was the reason why an engagement or marriage never came about. Around 1820, Caroline Richter took the name of the secret secretary Louis Medon who was the presumed father of her first child, Johann Wilhelm Adolf Medon, but he died early. She later stated to be Medon's widow. Her second son, the later royal dancer (1823–1905) was strongly rejected by Schopenhauer, since he had been born on 27 March 1823, Gruber, Robert: Schopenhauers Geliebte in Berlin, Wien, 1934, Briefe und Urkunden p. 43 etc. ten months after Schopenhauer's departure for Italy, from which he returned to Berlin only in 1825. A third pregnancy in 1826, for which she even ended her engagement at the Berlin Opera, led to a miscarriage. When Schopenhauer fled from cholera in 1831, Medon refused to leave behind his almost nine-year-old son Carl; This led to the final break in the relationship, despite her letters in the following years to him, in which she said she was healthy. She finally entered the stage, now as a singer at the Königsstädtisches Theater. In 1858, she again made a written contact with Schopenhauer, who therefore considered her in his will in February 1859. He left her the sum of 5000 Prussian thalers, a considerable portion of his fortune, on the condition that his legacy should not fall explicitly to Carl or other heirs of Medon. She is also the author of a hand-knitted \\"rose carpet\\", which Schopenhauer's estate administrator long regarded as a gift from Schopenhauer's sister.

Background Delsuc practiced civil law as a lawyer. Delsuc began Scouting in the 5th arrondissement of Paris Groupe Saint- Louis. In 1929, he succeeded Édouard de Macedo as leader of this group until 1945, though the group split into two in 1930. Antoine-Louis Cornette asked him to succeed Jacques Sevin at the Chamarande camp school. Mobilized in 1939, then demobilized in 1940, he took the lead of underground Scouting with François Bloch-Lainé and Michel de Paillerets, banned in the occupied zone. He entered the Resistance and was arrested several times by the Gestapo. Sent to prison, he was released for lack of evidence. After World War II, Delsuc became commissioner-general of the Scouts de France until 1946, officially occupying the position that he had occupied unofficially in the North Zone since his demobilization. In 1951, he was awarded the sixth Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting. In opposition to Michel Rigal, the Commissioner-General, he resigned from the National Council of the Scouts de France in 1958. Their opposition became public in June 1960 when he denounced Rigal's position in a letter published by France catholique, a moderate Catholic weekly, over the Algerian War. In March 1964, Monsignor Marc-Armand Lallier, as president of the Episcopal Commission for Youth, was asked by Delsuc, Pierre de Montjamont, Henry Dhavernas and Michel Menu to intervene to mitigate some of the radical changes underway in French Scouting, along with other bishops involved in Scouting, with the exception of Bishop Jean Rupp. Hostile to the pedagogical reform of 1964, he favored the birth of the Scouts unitaires de France and co-authored the booklet Bases fondamentales du Scoutisme.

The Ottoman Protectorate of Kara Bogdan (Moldavia) supported Russia in its war against the Ottomans with troops and by allowing the Russian army to cross its territory and to place garrisons in Moldavian fortresses. The Moldavians were represented by the Metropolitan of Moldavia Ghedeon. The text of the treaty was elaborated entirely by Ottoman Hospodar Dimitrie Cantemir, a former musician of the Sultan, who broke his oath to the Sultan and promised to become the suzeran of the Russian tsar.  Terms  In the preamble and in Article I, Dimitrie Cantemir worships the tsar, receiving in return protection from Peter I for himself and for all the people of Moldavia. It is provided that the lord of Moldavia \\"with all the great boyars and her nobles and with the inhabitants of any state of the glorious Moldavian people\\" should henceforth be under the protection of the tsar and will take an oath of obedience at first in secret, until at the entry of the Russian armies into the principality and then, the voivode will carry his faith secretly \\"by correspondence and other means\\". Article II makes the lord of Moldovia join the army of the Russian army. Articles III to V provide that the heirs of the Russian throne do not have the right to rule in Moldovia or in the Wallachian land. In Moldovia, the reign is to be hereditary in the Cantemir family.

Article XI provides that the borders of the principality, according to its ancient rights, are those described with the Dnieper River, Camenețu, Bender, with all of Budjak, Danube, Muntenia, the Grand Duchy of Transylvania and Poland. According to Articles XII to XV, Russian protection over Moldovia is to be maintained after the conclusion of the peace in the sense that Peter is not to leave Moldovia under the domination of the Gate.

He held a solo artist's exhibition in 2012, and was also known for playing the character Kong Kong, in the 2015 film The Assassin, directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien. Impact on Taiwanese society A prominent member of the LGBT community, who had lived there since 1979, Picoux was 68 years old. His suicide has generated much public sympathy, and led to calls for the introduction of marriage equality in Taiwan. According to his friends, he killed himself after he realised he had no right to make medical decisions on behalf of his cancer-stricken partner, Tseng Ching-chao, or any legal rights to the home they had shared for nearly 40 years. Tseng was the global agent of notable Chinese actress Gong Li. Picoux's death led to criticisms of the new administration of President Tsai Ing-wen, which had campaigned on promises to legalise same-sex marriage. Polls around the time showed that nearly three-quarters of the Taiwanese people favor marriage equality. In 2019, Taiwan introduced same-sex marriages, and many people noted and held a remembrance for Picoux at the time. Some groups in Taiwan honour him when promoting LGBT rights in Taiwan, promising that there won't \\"be another Jacques Picoux\\"-like tragedy. Drafting of new legislation Gay rights campaigners have said that there may now be a breakthrough in legislation, with an increase of support for marriage equality among members of the Legislative Yuan. Taiwanese Pride Watch activist Cindy Su says that “We actually can see that there are about 66 legislators who will probably vote yes on marriage equality”, making it a majority of 58.4%. Former Grand Justice Hsu Tzong-li has said that if it can be proved that homosexuals are a natural minority that have been misunderstood as abnormal, then it follows that the laws stating marriage is only between a man and a woman could be considered unconstitutional. Justice Hsu will become the nation's next Judicial Yuan President, after lawmakers approved his nomination in October 2016. Yu Mei-nu, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, has drafted a new law to be presented to legislators, and it may be passed as early as next year. If it does pass, Taiwan would be the first Asian country to legalise same-sex marriage. Homosexuality is considered taboo in many East Asian countries, and is illegal across much of South Asia. President Tsai is an open supporter of marriage equality, and has said she would support any decision made by the parliament. Same-sex marriage in Taiwan became legal on 24 May 2019. This made [Taiwan the first nation in Asia to recognize same-sex marriage. LGBT rights in Taiwan Taiwan is considered a very progressive society regarding gay rights, in a region where citizens of some countries can still be jailed for being gay. In December 2016, Taiwan's highest health authority announced plans to ban Conversion Therapy, which aims to change a person's sexual orientation. The Ministry of Health and Welfare said that the ban would take effect from March 2017. However, Taiwanese author Chu Hsin-yi (瞿欣怡), has criticized Taiwan for \\"calling itself gay-friendly... while being unwilling to let loose, even a bit, regulations affecting gay rights.\\" Despite fervent campaigning from anti- LGBT rights groups, LGBT rights in Taiwan made a historic step forward in 2019 with the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Though there are still some things missing from the introduction of same-sex marriage, such as international spouses from countries that do not allow same-sex marriages to be performed being barred from marrying in Taiwan itself, it is viewed as a great move forward for LGBT rights in the region.

Conferences at the academy initiated changes in politics, social sciences, religion, arts and culture. Topics have included the future of the European Union the integration of its countries, and concepts for the energy industry.

It is set over a 16-month period in 2015–16 and deals with two women going through gestational surrogacy, the genetic mother of the embryo created by in vitro fertilisation, and the woman carrying the child. It has been described by Patricia Tobin as a \\"quietly feminist play that asserts a heartfelt approach towards matters of infertility, adoption and motherhood\\". Plot Catherine is an ex-patriate Australian lawyer living in London with her architect husband. Aged in her mid-40s and having been through 18 cycles of in vitro fertilisation treatments over 11 years, Catherine is desperate for a child and gestational surrogacy is her last chance. Nellie is a 28-year old Catholic woman living in Boston, Massachusetts, (where surrogacy is legal), with two children. As a lawyer, Catherine ensures that the contract formed covers various topics which Nellie had not considered. Nellie sees herself as altruistic, able to help Catherine's dearest wish for a child come true, but with different backgrounds, values, and wealth, some degree of conflict is inevitable. Once Nellie has become pregnant, Catherine's controlling nature causes friction and Nellie gradually asserts herself – most notably when the contentious issue of selective reduction becomes relevant – and as it becomes clear that Catherine resents the experiences of pregnancy and child birth which she is missing. Nellie's maintenance of a sometimes too-honest vlog is also a source of tension. As seen in the images below, the relationship comes to involve substantial conflict and tension with each displaying their worst selves, to the point where Nellie shouts at one point \\"I'm the one who's carrying this baby!\\" eliciting the cold reply \\"Yes. And I'm the one who's paying,\\" from Catherine. In a play where money is generally not the issue, we are still reminded that surrogacy does raise issues of the commodification of human life and that differences in socioeconomic status cannot be entirely set aside. Nellie (foreground) with images of both women projected behind, from the Ensemble Theatre's 2016 production, photo by Clare Hawley Scenes take place either in person in New York, or through electronic media (Skype, text messages, phone calls) with Catherine in London and Nellie in Massachusetts. In one production, this was achieved by having the two actors on stage, sitting at computers and looking into tripod-mounted video cameras, with the images being projected onto the wall behind the stage (illustrated at left). These enlarged images provide \\"magnified clarities for the audience to engage and learn from\\" and was described as an ingenious production approach as it has the effect of \\"[a]mplifying emotional moments for the audience\\" by allowing the audience \\"to see close-ups of their faces and be a fly on the wall for tough conversations\\". The reviewer for Stage Whispers expressed concerns that this use of projections and technology-facilitated communications would be a distraction, but praised its simple execution as seeming \\"entirely natural\\" and as adding to the experience by achieving a closeness to the actors that is rare, even in very intimate theatres. Thematic content As Nadia Tass, puts it \\"[t]his is a play for today – the advances in medicine create a new world that allows new possibilities – in e-baby we enter that world and explore the raw truth, the unbridled joy and the paradox of surrogacy through a carefully woven story of love, generosity and a newborn child.\\" Cafarella chose to not delve into the issue of Nellie wanting to keep the child, allowing \\"more nuanced, if less dramatic, questions to be raised,\\" and used decades of research to explore issues without passing judgement. Gestational surrogacy has been a subject for Cafarella for years, and she is praised for touching \\"on most of the biological, technical, ethical and legal aspects ... in the play's 95 minutes ... without the loud sound of boxes being ticked\\". Topics explored in the play which are regularly missed in exploring surrogacy issues include \\"the blasé comments from relatives, the cold legal matters in a contractual obligation, [and] the instances where abortion becomes the best option to save a life\\". Nellie with the baby from near the end of the play (2016 Ensemble Theatre production, photo by Clare Hawley) Catherine's character is both \\"excited about the prospect of being a mother\\" but also struggling with \\"the desperation and shame that she [feels] in fear of being seen as less of a woman,\\" while Nellie is \\"not fully comprehending what she has agreed to, and [experiencing] the conflict this provokes with her religious beliefs,\\" while each is dealing with a \\"forced\\" friendship. The play is character-driven by the unlikely bond and blurred lines created by a commercial surrogacy agreement. The story is affecting through its resolute avoidance of sentimentality, except for the ending which gave in to the sappiness which had been avoided until this point, though at least one reviewer described the final scene as \\"like being slapped in the face, then hugged. I left with tears in my eyes.\\" The play has also been criticised for cutting short difficult-to-watch scenes, rather than pushing deeper by allowing them to last longer, a weakness ascribed to Cafarella's relative inexperience as a playwright. It \\"gives a gentle education to the uneducated on the intricacies of surrogacy\\" and \\"skims the surface like a light comedy,\\" thus taking a \\"sensitive approach towards a poignant issue [w]ith its enthralling narrative and light comic touch\\". The play could delve more deeply into the topic as it does \\"touch upon morally heavy issues with a keen sincerity that is hard to resist\\" but in circumstances where \\"women's rights over our bodies are being condemned, scrutinised and attacked now more than ever, it does feel like there's something more to give\\". Fiona Cameron, writing in The Music, commented that: \\"E-Baby is a very rare theatrical beast: a two-handed play by women, starring women and about issues that affect women viscerally. Indeed, another such production doesn't readily spring to mind ... [and] the men in the characters' lives, well, they were so peripheral as to be almost incidental ... [in this] play about hope and trust and how two women who would otherwise never have crossed paths are connected by a surrogate pregnancy.\\" This aspect was noted by other reviewers. Susanne Gervay of the Society of Women Writers NSW Inc described the play as a \\"bitter-sweet, funny, sad, real play of women\\". Carly Fisher stated that \\"[f]inding a play with a cast solely of two women is very unusual – finding one that has been produced and is performing is even less of an occurrence. Hopefully, ... more theatre companies will see the potential that a duologue holds and just how captivated an audience can be by the presence of just 2 women.\\" She also loved that money \\"was not the driving factor for enlisting as a surrogate but rather the burning desire to help someone fulfill a spiritual and moving part of the human condition and experience for a woman. This approach speaks volumes to the current climate in which the topics of surrogacy and IVF can be raised and presents a more humane interpretation of the surrogate than many other art forms have yet been daring enough to do\\". Production history Jane Cafarella was an Australian journalist, and \\"exhibits a journo's eye for research, balance and telling detail\\" in writing plays, which she began in 2011. e-baby is her first full-length play, and was premiered at the Chapel Off Chapel theatre in Melbourne in March 2015. Anna McCrossin-Owen was the director and dramaturg with Carolyn Bock (Catherine) and Sarah Ranken (Nellie) doing \\"a solid job in portraying the often-tense relationship between these two women\\". e-baby received a rehearsed reading at the So and So Arts Club in London on 14 July 2015, directed by Pamela Shermann and starring Kat Rogers (Catherine) and Becky Hands-Wicks (Nellie). The club aims to link emerging and established artists, and the play was developed under the club's auspices; the club also reports that a companion piece to e-baby is under development. The Sydney premiere was in October 2016 with the Ensemble Theatre under the direction of Nadia Tass, multi-award winner for her films Malcolm and Amy, and starred Danielle Carter as Catherine and Gabrielle Scawthorn as Nellie. Carter and Scawthorn were described as bringing \\"such life to their roles\\" and being \\"utterly believable – in equal parts loveable and frustrating – [so that] the heartbreak, when it comes, is visceral\\". It will receive its Hobart premiere in March 2017 with the Tasmanian Theatre Company as part of the 10 Days on the Island festival.

Retrieved from: https://www.m2scientifics.com/100-lab-drying-racks In addition to that, the pegs on the drying rack are easily removable and replaceable in order to maintain the cleaning of the lab racks to avoid contamination with other apparatus used on the same rack. Any common laboratory needs to have at least two or three drying racks per lab.Mallapaty G.(2001). Equipment Requirements for a PHC Centre Laboratory. The Public Health Care Laboratory. Retrieved from: http://www.phclab.com/images/phc.pdf A laboratory drying rack is a pegboard for drying labware in laboratory. Laboratory drying rack can be also used to drain the big-sized flasks in the laboratory. Lab Drying Rack can capably contain and dry up various types of laboratory glassware.  Types  Laboratory drying rack can be mainly categorized into three major types including stainless steel laboratory drying racks, epoxy laboratory drying racks, and acrylic laboratory drying racks. ;Stainless steel laboratory drying rack Stainless steel laboratory drying rack, which is also known as a 'Mod- Rack' pegboard, is the drying rack made of stainless steel that uses to drain laboratory accessories. The examples of stainless steel laboratory drying rack are flask holders, soap dispensers, paper towel dispensers, glove box holders, drain shelves. Stainless steel pegboard installation is very easy and quick to set up with basic hand equipment's, and it does not damage the wall as mounting brackets and hardware are being used. ;Epoxy laboratory drying rack Epoxy laboratory drying racks are the most common type of drying rack that are used among university labs and science classrooms in many high schools. Epoxy drying racks are mounted directly to a wall or other solid structures which can be set up with basic hand tools and power tools. They are easily installed by using wall anchors and other strong fasteners due to their small weight. Typical installation is to drill holes, one at each corner, and to use the mounting points in order to fix it to the wall. ; Acrylic laboratory drying rack Acrylic laboratory drying racks give a unique feature that other pegboards cannot do. The clear acrylic is transparent, which means that it allows the light to pass through as well as brightening the working area. Acrylic pegboards are mostly in the place where there are no lights, or to be done in dim areas. Like epoxy pegboards, acrylic laboratory pegboards are also installed with basic tools and power tools in the same way. However, acrylic pegboards are made up of plastic, so it can be easily scratched as compared to the epoxy and the stainless steel drying rack.  Usage  Laboratory drying rack can contain and dry up various types of laboratory glassware such as beaker, Erlenmeyer flask, volumetric flask, and graduated cylinder. ; Tube Laboratory drying rack is usually used to dry up the tube in the laboratory; for example, it can help in drying test tube, boiling tube, and Thiele tube. ; Flask In addition, laboratory drying rack can hold many types of flask including round-bottomed flask, Florence flask, kjeldahl flask, pear-shaped flask, retort flask, Schlenk flask, Straus flask, Buchner flask, and Claisen flask. ; Funnel Moreover, laboratory drying rack can be used to drain other types of laboratory glassware as well. For instance, in terms of funnel, it is used to dry up separating funnel, dropping funnel, filter funnel, and Thistle funnel. ; Benefits of using laboratory drying rack It is better than using towel or compressed air, due to the fact that it can introduce fibers and impurities, that can contaminate the solution.About Education.

He became associated with the flotation of several family owned businesses of the period including Harrods departmental store. He was a close friend of Lillie Langtry and provided funding for her theatrical ventures in 1900. Sponge merchant Cohen was born in Whitechapel, London in 1853, the son of Israel and Rachael Cohen. His father was a dealer in sponges, as was his grandfather, who came to England from the Netherlands. Cohen was the eldest son from a large family with fifteen siblings.In her memoirs, his daughter, Hilda says there were 15 siblings; checks on the census records of the period have provided evidence of at least 13. He was known as Emmanuel when young, but later used the first name Edgar. He became a sponge merchant working for I & M Cohen, a business owned by his father and his uncle, Moss Cohen. Edgar remained with the business as a director after both the senior partners died in 1894. In 1903 the firm was amalgamated with Cresswell Brothers and Schmitz, Henry Marks & Sons, becoming the public company, International Sponge Importers Limited. Retail industry In the 1880s, Edgar Cohen had a chance meeting and conversation with a gentleman during a journey in London. They exchanged cards and later met and discussed business. The gentleman was Charles Digby Harrod who owned a small shop in Brompton Road. After a fire in his shop and the subsequent rebuild, Cohen suggested to him that he could sell the business via a stock market flotation. This was agreed and in 1889 a prospectus was published indicating that Mr C. D. Harrod was leaving the business on health grounds and a limited company was being formed to buy his holdings for £100,000. Cohen joined the board of the new company (Harrod’s Stores, Limited) and received a large remuneration from Charles Harrod in gratitude. He remained on the board for many years, becoming a director of Harrods Buenos Aires when it was created in 1914, and involved with the takeover of Dickins & Jones in 1914 and Swan & Edgar in 1920. Cohen was a director of several other companies in the retail and clothing sector including D. H. Evans. No objections were raised about him being a director on the board of rival companies. Today this would probably be considered a conflict of interests. He was chairman of the departmental store Crisp & Co. Ltd., in Seven Sisters and the milliners, Louise & Co. His two sons-in-law, American, Leopold D Ginsburg and milliner Frank Reginald Brighten, were involved in the development of this company. In 1903 Maison Lewis of Paris was purchased and in 1910 the French milliner Maison Virot was absorbed into the business. For his part in these negotiations, the shareholders voted Cohen a 3000 guineas bonus and appointed him chairman for life. The General Motor Cab Co. Ltd In 1907 Cohen became involved with The General Motor Cab Co., a business established to create a large fleet of taxis in London based on the Paris system. Attempts had previously been made to introduce cabs but with limited success. Initially there were 500 vehicles (Renaults), with metering equipment purchased from France, and later there were plans to extend the number in the fleet to over 3000. Cohen was the managing director for the business, responsible for the purchase of the vehicles, spares, garaging, training and negotiations with the authorities in London and with the drivers. Theatre The theatre played a big part in Cohen’s life and in particular he loved opera. There were several family connections with the stage; his brother-in-law, Count Max Hollender, was the chairman of the Palace Theatre, London, and his nephew, Alfred Butt, was an impresario with controlling interests in several theatres. His son-in- law, Frank Brighten, provided costumes for London productions and his daughters, Hilda and Madeline (Maddie), were both involved with the theatre. He also provided funding for Lillie Langtry when she took the lease and refurbished the Imperial Theatre in 1900. Cohen’s house parties were lavish affairs and many of the celebrities of the period from the world of entertainment attended such as Enrico Caruso, Leslie Stuart, Auguste van Biene, Lewis Waller and many others. Fred and Adele Astaire once danced at the house and Paul Whiteman’s band performed. Horse racing and gambling Two of Cohen’s passions were gambling and horse racing. His horses were in training with H. Eugene Leigh in France and after about 1906 Fred Darling in England, who was just at the beginning of his training career. He also shared a racing stud with Lillie Langtry and persuaded her to change from her trainer Donohue to Fred Darling in 1907. Cohen’s son, Stanley, inherited his love of gambling but got into debt and embezzled money from the International Sponge Importers Limited, where he had been a director and manager for 26 years. In 1935 he was sentenced to 12 months in prison for the offence. Quick Lunch Company In 1903 Cohen opened an American style quick lunch restaurant on the Strand. However, the business failed and Cohen was forced to wind up the operation in January 1905 and appoint a liquidator. 8 Clarges Street Cohen worked from his London offices at 8 Clarges Street in London. His visitors included business associates, jockeys, trainers, people seeking financial support, entertainers asking for introductions and inventors looking for funding. One such was a Frenchman called Lemoine who claimed to have invented a process for making diamonds. In 1901 Cohen advanced several hundred pounds to obtain an interest in the scheme, but abandoned this after further investigation. However, Lemoine continued his quest for money and persuaded Sir Julius Wernher of De Beers to part with several thousands pounds. Lemoine was later arrested and put on trial. During the trial Cohen published details of the dealing he had with Lemoine and also published the formula. Family Cohen married Ada Beyfus in 1876. She was the daughter of Charlotte Abrahams and Solomon Beyfus, who was an East End trader and bill discounter living in Bedford Square, London. When they first married, Cohen and Ada took a neighbouring house in Bedford Square but in about 1891 moved to 4 Hall Road, St John's Wood. Sometime after 1918 Cohen moved to 10 Cambridge Gate, Regents Park.data from electoral registers and London census 1861 to 1911 Ada and Edgar Cohen had six children, although the first died very young. There were four daughters: Constance (Connie), Hilda, Madeleine (Maddie), Ida and a son, Stephen. Cohen’s business success seemed to fail him in later years. His wife died in 1916 and he passed away at the age of 80 on 29 January 1933. His probate put his final wealth at £5. He was buried in the Willesden Jewish Cemetery. Lillie Langtry Cohen had a close relationship with Lillie Langtry, they shared the love of horseracing and the theatre where Cohen provided financial backing for her. Cohen's daughter, Hilda Brighten, published a book called No Bridge to Yesterday about her early family life. One passage in the book relates to Lillie Langtry. She wrote that her father admired and adored Langtry and regarded her as \\"the most exquisitely lovely woman he had ever met\\".

The two buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. The main building held the offices of The Detroit News until 2013, and was also the site of the first commercial radio broadcast (on WWJ) in the United States. History Detroit News Building, circa 1910s The Detroit News was founded in 1873 by James E. Scripps, who controlled the paper until his death in 1906. He was succeeded by his son-in-law George Gough Booth. The paper's circulation grew rapidly in the 20th century, with over 100,000 in 1906 and over 225,000 in 1918. Booth, foreseeing this growth, planned to expand the paper's offices then on Shelby Street. However, the paper's growth exceeded the constraints of the space, and in 1913 the News acquired this block on Lafayette for $250,000. The site at the time included the 1858 home of Zachariah Chandler, a remnant of when the area had been a fashionable residential district. Booth hired architect Albert Kahn to design the new building. The two men worked together on the design, with Booth detailing his vision of a grand, civic-minded refinement of the essentially industrial nature of the building. Ground was broken at the site in November 1915, and construction was completed by October 1917 at a cost of $2,000,000. Additions to the structure were made almost immediately: in 1918 a paper storage warehouse, also designed by Kahn, was added, and in 1920–21 a sixth floor was added to the original building. In 1924, a parking garage across Third Avenue was constructed, containing retail shops and a full-service garage in addition to parking spaces. In 1920, radio station WWJ began broadcasting from the building. WWJ was the first commercial radio broadcaster in the United States. This building remained the home of The Detroit News for nearly a century. However, fortunes of the newspaper industry declined, particularly in Detroit. In 1998, as part of the Joint Operation Agreement between the News and the Detroit Free Press, Free Press staff vacated the Detroit Free Press Building and moved here. In 2014, the Free Press and News staff moved operations to leased space in the former Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch Building, and the Detroit News Building was sold to Bedrock Real Estate, a branch of Quicken Loans. Description The art department featured murals painted by department employees The Detroit News complex consists of two buildings constructed in 1915–1924: the Detroit News Building and the associated Parking Garage. Detroit News Building The Detroit News Building consists of three components covering an entire city block. The main section, constructed in 1915–17, occupies the east half of the block. It is a six-story, commercial-style building, constructed with a steel frame and reinforced concrete clad in limestone. Adjoining this building is the 1918–19 Paper Storage Warehouse addition. Single story additions built in 1921 and 1924 fill the remaining portion of the block. The three street-facing sides of the building are faced in buff Indiana Limestone atop a low gray granite base. The facades between the outer bays feature arches at ground level, separated by raised piers rising to the fifth floor. Parking Garage The 200-space parking garage was constructed across Third Avenue from the News Building in 1924. The structure is a five-story building with rooftop parking, constructed with a steel-frame and reinforced concrete. The facade is constructed in Art Deco style, using the same buff-colored brick and limestone trim materials as the Warehouse addition. The parking garage's front on Third is visually dominated by a central tower with projecting corner bays.

Tuscalee would be inducted into the U. S. Racing Hall of Fame and the Maryland Thoroughbred Hall of Fame. As at 2018, Tuscalee's American record of 37 Steeplechase wins still stands.  Background  Tuscalee was a bay gelding born in 1960. He stood in height, and ran for 9 years in total. His sire was Tuscany, a multiple stakes winning horse whose wins included the Rumson Handicap, Toboggan Handicap and the Salvator Mile Handicap.  Racing career = Flat career  He started his racing career as a flat racing horse, but only won once in 8 flat races as a 3-year-old. After winning a second time as a 4-year-old, he was switched to steeplechase racing under the care of trainer Leiter Aitcheson.  Steeplechase career  Tuscalee had 7 steeplechase victories in his 4-year- old-season, 2 wins as a 5-year-old and 10 wins as a 6-year-old. To this day, his third steeplechase season is still a record for the most wins in a season for a steeplechaser. For the rest of his career, he performed more moderately. His career ended at the age of 12 when he won his 4th and final National Hunt Cup, giving him his 37th steeplechase victory and his 39th overall victory.  After retirement  Tuscalee was inducted into United States Racing Hall of Fame in 2013.

The complex was completed in 2009 and is situated close to the national stadium, Hampden Park. History Toryglen Regional Football Centre just prior to opening in 2009 Toryglen cost approximately £17 million to build, with funding from Glasgow City Council and sportscotland. It was constructed by CBC and uses turf from Greenfields The centre opened for business in April 2009, with the official opening in August of that year; Scotland's most-capped player Kenny Dalglish was the special guest at the ceremony. The centre was built on old red blaes (gravel) playing fields used by Queen's Park Secondary School (closed 1994); some of the land may have been contaminated with toxic chromium waste from a local chemical works. The culverted Malls Mire Burn flows beneath the site. A large supermarket and a regional police headquarters are located nearby. Features Indoor pitch at its full extent during an amateur matchThe main feature is a fully enclosed, international-sized artificial turf pitch engineered to the highest specifications available at the time. The dimensions of the playing field are the same as Celtic Park. There is also a raised visitor area featuring a snack bar and bench seating for 700 spectators. There are three full-sized, FIFA- approved 2-star floodlit outdoor artificial pitches outside. The primary outdoor pitch was re-laid in late 2018 after a decade of constant use.South Glasgow 4-1 DTI FC, South Glasgow FC, 22 December 2018 The indoor pitch includes a plastic/canvas dividing curtain which can be lowered and raised from the 18m-high ceiling, separating the area into halves or quarter sections suitable for Seven-a-side games. The Toryglen complex has its own vehicle parking and more spaces are available near Hampden (except on event days at the stadium). The pitch divided into two halves (grey curtain) No professional team is based at Toryglen, meaning the facilities can be hired by local clubs and groups at most times. A large proportion of the juvenile and amateur teams in the Glasgow and Rutherglen/Cambuslang areas who do not have a permanent home ground of their own now play their fixtures at the complex (including the revived Third Lanark) due to the quality of the surface and the low chance of cancellation due to weather conditions (although the outdoor parks are susceptible to waterlogging in heavy rain). In 2012 the controlling company faced criticism from youth teams’ representatives over prices rises at Toryglen. Minor international matches such as Scotland women's under-17 and Centenary Shield (schoolboy) fixtures have been played there, and professional teams have trained at the facility when their usual training grounds were unavailable during times of bad weather. The outdoor pitches have hosted semi- finals of the Scottish Women's Cup, while the final of the 2011 competition was staged indoors at the venue.

Background The first version of the Ecological Corridors of Tropical Forests of Brazil proposal was developed by a group of consultants at the request of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment and presented in the first half of 1997. Seven major corridors were proposed: the Central Amazon Ecological Corridor, Northern Amazon Ecological Corridor, South Amazon Ecological Corridor, South Amazon Ecotones Ecological Corridor, Western Amazon Ecological Corridor, Central Atlantic Forest Ecological Corridor and Serra do Mar Ecological Corridor. These corresponded to about 25% of the rainforests of Brazil. Priority was given to the Central Amazon Corridor and the Central Atlantic Forest Corridor, which would test and develop the concepts for use with the subsequent corridors. Proposed scope The South Amazon Ecological Corridor was one of five Amazon region corridors identified. It included eight priority areas in three main Amazon ecoregions, and was identified as vulnerable, locally important, and moderate priority at a regional level in a 1994 Miami workshop. The proposed corridor mostly lies in the state of Pará, but extends west into Amazonas and east across the north of Tocantins into Maranhão. The corridor would have an area of .

Aria, Alison, Emily, Mona, Caleb and Spencer team up with the Rosewood P.D. to find Hanna. Detective Furey leads the investigation and promises to Spencer to find both Hanna and Noel, as Spencer kisses him on the cheek, resulting in an awkward-yet-great situation. Mona and Caleb investigate Jenna, and discover she doesn't know where either Hanna nor Noel are. Mona receives a call from Hanna and secretly leaves to assist her friend.

Benitez of Cryptic Rock gave the episode a good review, calling it a \\"Mid-Season finale to die for.\\" Mark Trammell of TV Equals praised the episode, stating, \\"While a little too much time was spend on the mid-season finale dealing with all the various ‘ships in play for my tastes, the ending confrontation more than made up for it, and if you’d told me we’d ever see the day that [the series] featured a full-on decapitation, I’d have told you that you were crazier than a roomful of Radley patients, and yet, here it was. You gotta love it.\\" On the other side, the episode received an unfavorable review from Paul Dailly, from TVFanatic, who labeled it as \\"one of the weakest finales to date.\\" He added, \\"[the episode] was far from perfect.

It has been listed as an official historical monument by the French Ministry of Culture since 1978. The Castle of Terre Neuve was built in the 1580s and 1590s for Nicolas Rapin.  The origins  On a plateau opposite of the historic center of Fontenay-le-Comte Nicolas Rapin bought a farm in 1584. Former mayor of the city, chased by Protestants in 1569, Nicolas Rapin is known for his military career, but also as a poet and a lawyer. Although having fought against the Huguenots, Rapin co-signed the Satire Ménippée, a work supporting the accession of Henri IV to power against the Catholic League. Ennobled in 1590 (the Satire Ménippée circulated from 1593), Nicolas Rapin built his castle around 1594. Close to royal power and humanist circles, Nicolas Rapin welcomed some renowned guests in Terre-Neuve such as Agrippa d'Aubigné or the Duke of Sully (prime minister for Henri IV). In 1691 the Rapin family is ruined, the castle is sold several times before being purchased by a congregation of Vincentian priests around 1701. Moved here to evangelize the region, they still occupied the house during the Revolution period.Adélie Avril, Le château de Terre-Neuve à Fontenay-le-Comte (Vendée). Mémoire de Master II d’Histoire et Critique des Arts., Université de Rennes 2, 2007>  Octave de Rochebrune, the great 19th century owner  Born in Terre-Neuve in 1824, Octave de Rochebrune is the grandson of Claude Tendron de Vassé who bought the château in 1805. Student at Stanislas College in Paris, he later entered the studio of the painter and lithographer Justin Ouvrié known for his depictions of monuments and cities. Returning to Fontenay-le-Comte in 1848, Octave de Rochebrune marries Alix Grelier du Fougeroux whose grandfather took part in the Vendée war as a vendean lieutenant (his sword is exposed in the château). Little by little, Octave de Rochebrune indulges in the technique of etching. Gradually, he learned how to engrave, work the copper plates, handle the acid technique. In his workshop at Terre-Neuve, the majors French monuments such as Chambord castle, the Louvre museum or monument of Vendée as the church of Vouvant will come out of the press. Engraver, erudite and art lover (he was a friend of artists including the painter Paul Baudry), Octave de Rochebrune had a brief political career. Close to legitimist circles, he held the office of mayor of Fontenay-le-Comte three times between 1868 and 1878. He died in Fontenay in 1900 and is buried in Notre-Dame cemetery near his wife who died in 1872. He leaves behind him an important collection, including 492 engraved brass.Claire Guillermic, Octave de Rochebrune (1824-1900), graveur vendéen.

The set-up of the different items and furniture's collected outside of Terre-Neuve represent the architectural ideal of Octave de Rochebrune. Most of the Renaissance elements added by Rochebrune comes from the castle of Coulonges-sur-l'Autize (formerly Coulonges-les-Royaux) : Porch, coffers, door frame in the dining room, vaults of the workshop, fireplace in the main living room. The castle of Coulonges was partly in ruin prior to the Revolution. Rochebrune's approach was similar when he restored and installed the fireplace from the seneschal house of Fontenay-le-Comte, in the dining room.Marie-Thérèse Réau, Fontenay-le-Comte, capitale du Bas-Poitou Thanks to its proximity with the Count of Chambord, Henri d'Artois, Octave de Rochebrune received two doors from François Ier era and thirteen suns from the room of Louis XIV in Chambord.

The name Okamatapati is derived from Omutapati, the Otjiherero name for the Mouse-eared combretum, a shrub that is common in the area. Herero people were resettled to this area, then known as Hereroland, in the 1960s. The Odendaal Plan declared several bantustans, one for each tribe, and forced Blacks to vacate all other areas of then-South-West Africa. Okamatapati was situated at the western edge of the Herero area. An affluent community developed who soon elected their own tribal chiefs. The Okamatapati Farmers Association was founded in 1983. It ran the first Okamatapati Show, an agricultural show for cattle farmers, in 1986. The show has been run for the 28th time in 2016 but is no longer conducted in Okamatapati. In 2012 it moved to Windhoek and became part of the Windhoek Show. Except a one-time stint at the Grootfontein Show in 2014 it is now held annually in Windhoek. Today the area around Okamatapati is a conservancy of that has been established in 2005. it had a population of 1,899 people. The conservancy consists of flat, sandy thornveld savannah and has an average annual rainfall of . The main economic activity is cattle farming, particularly weaner production, which is supported by the occurrence of Terminalia sericea, a deciduous tree that the animals feed on during the dry season.

Without access to justice, people are not able to fully exercise their rights, challenge discrimination, or hold decision-makers accountable for their actions. The manner in which nations help their citizens gain access to justice vary by nation. Access to justice may be increased through properly funded and staffed legal aid organizations that provide free legal services to the poor, and through pro bono programs through which volunteer attorneys provide services and representation in court, or through other programs designed to help people gain legal remedies through courts or other institutions of justice.  Free Access to Law Movement The Free Access to Law Movement (FALM) was founded in 1992, with the goal of providing free online access to basic legal information and resources. In 2002, FALM adopted the Declaration on Free Access to Law. The goal of the movement has been to ensure that legal information is freely available to everyone. The declaration declared public legal information to be the common heritage of mankind. The member organizations of FALM, primarily through the Internet, engaged in widespread publication of primary and secondary legal information. Early examples include the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School and the Australasian Legal Information Institute, a joint project of the University of Technology Sydney and the University of New South Wales. The latter involved early adoption of hypertext technology to represent laws as a network of nodes, each representing a section.Legal_Information_Institutes.htm In 2013, Cornell Law School established the Journal of Open Access to Law, to promote international research on the topic of open access to law.  Worldwide = Myanmar  MyJustice is a European Union-funded Access to Justice Initiative aiming to equip the people of Myanmar with the knowledge, confidence and opportunities to resolve conflicts fairly, equitably and justly. Since 2015 they have setting up a number of \\"justice centres\\" across Myanmar to improve access to justice by offering free legal advice to low- income and marginalised people, as well as being involved in projects relating to the introduction of legal aid and legal training.  Pakistan  Access to Justice Initiatives (AJI) are a cluster of projects carried out by the Sarhad Rural Support Programme (SRSP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, which aim at enhancing legal awareness and empowering citizens at the grass-roots level by enabling them to lobby for their rights and seek remedies for their legal problems. = Configuration = Access to Justice Initiatives comprises the following projects: # Legal Empowerment # Aitebaar Alternate Dispute Resolution # Aitebaar Awareness Rising # Strengthening Rule of Law in Malakand # Community Based Conflict Resolution = Features = A common feature of the projects is that they all aim at strengthening the capacity of the disadvantaged communities to protect their rights and to participate and hold public institutions accountable. In traditional hierarchical societies, civil society organisations face challenges in promoting access to services for marginalized and vulnerable groups. The projects seek to addresses issues of weak links among justice mechanisms and a lack of reliable legal support. Some of the projects focus on the informal justice institutions so that alternative dispute resolution methods can be used to settle disputes at community level, while helping to create a forum for dialogue between the formal and informal mechanisms. Members of the communities are trained as paralegals to bridge the gap between the most vulnerable members of society and the state institutions. In remote and backward areas of Pakistan the public at large is reluctant in trusting the police or lawyers but shows greater inclination in trusting notables of their own communities, who often resolve disputes via the Jirga system. The paralegals and mediators are briefed about human rights, legal system and the limits of their authority in solving complicated disputes. This ensures that rights of the participants are not forfeited. The Dispute Resolution Councils (DRC’s) set up in this respect are required to work in collaboration the local police to ensure transparency and efficiency. A significant number of women have been trained as mediators and paralegal to make the programme more receptive to women. Legal aid is provided to individuals whose troubles cannot be resolved through negotiation, conciliation, mediation or other informal method's. Very often, case which merit legal aid involve issues of child marriage, forced marriage, matrimonial cruelty, child custody, deprivation of inheritance, discrimination etc.  United States  Because the traditional model for delivery services demanded all legal work to be done in a bespoke manner the supply of legal services is generally inelastic. Households that are ineligible for legal aid but are not able to easily afford bespoke legal services are effectively underserved by the traditional model. A report by the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Delivery of Legal Services found that \\"among moderate-income households, 39% used the legal system to attempt resolution of their legal problems, 23% attempted resolution without legal help, and 26% took no action.\\" =Technological solutions= Lawyers, designers, and computers scientists have considered ways to use technology to improve non-lawyers' access to justice.See CodeX Techindex.

Description  The bomb consisted of a block of explosive, into which was inserted a metal tube of about 7 cm containing an OTO Mod. 35 hand grenade (known to the British as the \\"Red Devil\\") to serve as a detonator. The whole assembly was then covered with a canvas bag fitted with a transport hook. Built in two variants of 1 kg and 2 kg, they required a good physical strength for the launch because of the weight but they were only effective if launched precisely on the engine compartment, in which case they were able to destroy any armored vehicle. For this reason the soldier who wanted to use it necessarily had to approach the objective avoiding being hit by machine-gun fire on board or by the infantry who followed the tanks during their advance. In 1942 samples of \\"Pazzaglia\\" Bombs were sent to be studied in Italy by the military engineering but they never were mass-produced in homeland factory.  Operative use  For an effective launch the bomb must be handled with the right hand on the handle and using the left hand to withdraw the safe. To be properly launched it had to be thrown by standing up with a circular path from 'top down and possibly at least 20/25 mt. Normally Italian soldiers, when they judged the distance of their objective, jumped out of their defensive positions (trenches or holes) and rushed to approach the tank. Other times crawling in between the moving carts and, to avoid being crushed by the tracks, even leaving that these would pass over them and then get up and launch their weapons after the tank had passed. Besides the risk of being hit by enemy weapons or being crushed by the tracks, the same use of the bomb was dangerous because high flames immediately blazed with its explosion of the engine compartment, also hot hydraulic fluid squirted in all directions and ammunition inside the tank could explode. Seeing in action the Italian Bersaglieri with their Passaglia, Erwin Rommel wrote in his commentary: «The German soldiers have impressed the world but the Italian bersaglieri have impressed the German soldiers».

Biography He was the son of a respected English merchant, Richard Pickman. Richard was born in Wallingford in 1763 and died in 1838 in Liverpool. He traded glassware and ceramics from the Potter County of Staffordshire with China and had commercial headquarters in the port cities of London and Liverpool. He married Susannah Jones, who was from Farmborg Hall, London. His son, William Pickman Hicks, moved to Cadiz in 1810 to trade with these products in the city but died in 1822 without having much success. In 1822 William's half-brother, Charles Pickman, moved to Seville to continue with the business. He partnered with the widow of William and opened his shop in \\"calle Gallegos\\". Charles married William's daughter, Maria Josefa Pickman y Martinez de la Vega. He started a project in 1837 with his brother- in-law, Guillermo Aponte y Martinez de la Vega, to found a ceramics factory.http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/cultura/archivos_html/sites/default/contenidos/archivos/ahpsevilla/documentos/Hoja_informativa_abril_2016.pdf After the ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizabal, he leased the Carthusian Monastery of Santa Maria de las Cuevas (which was empty) with the intention of starting his ceramics manufacturing business just as his father had done in England. The brand of ceramics Pickman took its name from Charles's last name and the name of the monastery: la Cartuja de Sevilla-Pickman. The business flourished, and the ceramics factory became one of the most well known in Europe. He also managed to trade with countries in Latin American. Thanks to his social and commercial relations, he came to be elected Royal Commissioner of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce in the province of Seville and Vice President of the National Agricultural Academy, Manufacturing, and Commerce of Paris. In 1871, the King Amadeo I of Spain chose Pikman's factory as the supplier to the Royal House. In February 1873, during the reign of that monarch, he received the noble title of Marquess of Pickman for his entrepreneurial activity.

A total of 49 people, including 44 on the ground, were killed in the crash. At least 20 people were injured, with reports that the number could be much higher. The accident was caused due to cargo shift in the compartment, causing a shift in the center of gravity. A short circuit also caused the landing gear to extend, leading to the aircraft's rapid increase in drag. The crash was the second deadliest aircraft accident involving a Boeing C-97G Stratofreighter. Accident The aircraft, a Boeing C-97G Stratofreighter, registered as HI-481, was operated as a cargo flight by Belize Air International. It was carrying 18 champion horses, for an equestrian competition in Miami, for Indianapolis for the 10th Annual Pan American Games. The aircraft took off from Mexico City International Airport at 5:01 p.m. Five minutes after takeoff, the aircraft suddenly had difficulty gaining altitude. The altimeter failed, and the crew tried to pull the plane up as it flew directly towards skyscrapers. The pilots managed to dodge several skyscrapers in the city, including the Mexicana Airlines Headquarters tower and the Hotel de Mexico. The crew then discussed a suitable place for an emergency landing. Due to the lack of time and controls of the plane, both pilots decided to land the plane at Toluca - Mexico highway. A problem developed on the plane's landing gear and caused a short circuit. The short circuit caused small fires on the aircraft, with smoke emitting from its engines. The aircraft then slammed onto the highway with its belly. The wings struck a high tension tower, causing a massive blackout in a nearby neighborhood. The aircraft flew under a pedestrian bridge and smashed into vehicles, killing some motorists instantly and horribly injuring others. The four engined plane skidded down the highway and broke into two sections. The tail of the plane separated from its main body and smashed into a three-story building, while the rest of the aircraft skidded and impacted the crowded Tras Lomita restaurant. It then exploded in what onlookers described as an \\"inferno\\". Parts of the aircraft then flew into a gas station and caused a massive fire. Emergency services immediately arrived at the scene and pulled several survivors from the wreckage. At least 7 people inside the plane were found alive, including pilot Frederick Moore, an American; co-pilot Robert Banty, also an American and the load master. Dead horses could be seen after the crash. Two out of 18 horses had to be shot by police, as they were too badly injured. At least one horse survived in good condition and was evacuated from the scene. 12 people were evacuated by helicopter to the Red Cross hospital with third-degree burns. Teresa Marquez of the federal Emergency Rescue Service said at least seven people on the ground were severely burned and taken to two hospitals. At least 25 vehicles were rammed and caught fire due to the crash, and a further 44 people on the ground were killed, bringing the death toll to nearly 50. Officials estimated the plane left a 450-to-600 foot path of destruction as it skidded along the highway. Cause In response to the crash, pilot Moore and co-pilot Banty were detained by Mexican authorities. The investigation found that during the climbout process, the horses inside the aircraft panicked and ran around inside the compartment, causing a shift of the aircraft's center of gravity. A short circuit later occurred and caused a gear malfunction, which caused small fires on the body of the aircraft and further panicked the horses.

Widespread coverage of this South Korean political scandal began in late October 2016. On November 29, Park offered to begin the process of removing herself from power. On December 9, Park was impeached, and then Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn became the acting president. On December 21, a Special Prosecution Team led by Park Young Soo began to investigate the Choi Soon-sil scandal. On March 10, 2017, The Constitutional Court of Korea ruled to uphold the impeachment of President Park Geun-Hye. All 8 judges agreed that President Park abused her power. A new election was held 60 days after with Moon Jae-in, a member of the Democratic Party of Korea, winning over 41% of the popular vote in the election. Background=Choi Soon-sil Choi Soon-sil had known President Park Geun-hye since 1974, when Choi's father, Choi Tae-min, offered to counsel and advise Park as she and her family were grieving after the assassination of Park's mother, then-first lady Yuk Young-soo. In 2007, a South Korean newsmagazine publicized a thirty-year-old Korean Central Intelligence Agency report, revealing that Choi Tae-min initially approached Park by telling her that the deceased Yuk had appeared to him in his dreams, asking him to help her daughter. A diplomatic cable from the U.S. embassy in Seoul, later made public by WikiLeaks, reported subsequent rumors that Choi was a \\"Korean Rasputin\\" who \\"had complete control over Park's body and soul during her formative years and...his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result.\\" In response to this scrutiny, Park called Choi Tae-min a \\"patriot\\" and stated she was grateful for his counsel and comfort during \\"difficult times.\\" In late 2016, reports surfaced which raised questions that Choi Soon-sil had inappropriate access to, and possible influence over, President Park. Choi had allegedly been given regular reports on Park's schedule, speeches, and personnel arrangements, and had even seen classified information on secret meetings with North Korea. Choi was also alleged to have dictated, or at the least influenced, Park's decision-making on everything from her choice of handbags, to public statements, to state affairs. Choi has been indicted for extorting bribes, abusing power illegally and leaking classified documents. Choi is also accused of having influenced Ewha Womans University to change their admission criteria in order for her daughter Chung Yoo-ra to be given a place there. Censorship and early reporting The Park regime exercised power over the media in various ways, including business ties with media executives, and had established a commission to harass and prosecute social media critics, including those who held her accountable for handling of the 2014 sinking of MV Sewol, in which 304 civilians died. Choi's name had been completely obscured from public records through a variety of means. In July 2016, Park's illegal business ties to Choi Soon-sil were uncovered by a reporter working for Chosun Broadcasting Company, who even cornered Choi and attempted to secure an interview, but his report was spiked by executives at the company. In September, more cautious stories were printed by newspapers, alluding to Park's shady business deals, and on September 20, The Hankyoreh was able to independently uncover Choi's name by interviewing employees at a massage parlor. The managing editor of The Hankyoreh published a public appeal for Chosun Broadcasting Company to air the spiked story.NHK, November 19, 2018. アナザーストーリーズ「パク・クネ 弾劾の舞台裏～その時 韓国は沸騰した～」 Following this story, investigation of Choi deepened, but her exact relationship with Park was still unclear.  Discovery of Choi Soon-sil's tablet computer  Reporters covering the story for JTBC Newsroom located a rental office in Germany which had previously been temporarily used by Choi. There, they retrieved a Samsung tablet computer which contained her login information. They found that Choi had received drafts of 44 presidential speeches on the tablet before she abandoned it. One of the most troubling of these was a Microsoft Word document which contained a corrected draft of a speech made by Park in Germany on March 28, 2014. To avoid plausible deniability by Park, they initially reported on October 19 that anonymous sources had rumored Choi was editing Park's speeches. Once Park responded by denying that any of her speeches had been sent to private individuals, JTBC publicized their possession of the tablet on October 24. The following morning, Park admitted that Choi had been acting as her unofficial, unpaid personal assistant. Coverage of Choi subsequently spread to all media. Media outlets reported that Choi and President Park's senior staff members, including both Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung, have allegedly used their influence to extort ₩77.4 billion (US$60 million) from Korean chaebols—family-owned large business conglomerates—and set up two culture- and sports-related foundations, Mir and K-sports foundations. Arrests * On November 2, 2016, top presidential aides Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung were arrested for abusing power and aiding Choi. The Supreme Prosecutors' Office of Korea (SPO), in laying charges against Choi and two former presidential aides, have alleged that President Park colluded with the three in certain criminal activities. The president will be questioned by prosecutors, the first time this has occurred with a serving South Korean president. * On November 8, award-winning music video director Cha Eun-taek was arrested at the Incheon International Airport upon his return from China. He was accused of \\"meddling in state-led projects and exerted undue influence in the culture sector\\". * On December 31, a chief of the National Pension Fund and former health & welfare minister Moon Hyung-pyo was arrested for pressuring the state fund to back a major merger deal for Samsung C&T.; * On January 2, 2017, Chung Yoo-ra, the daughter of Choi Soon-sil, was arrested in Denmark for staying in the country illegally. * On January 3, Ewha Womans University professor and renowned writer Ryu Chul-kyun (pen name Yi In-hwa) was arrested for doing the homework of Chung Yoo-ra. * On January 11, former chief of admissions at Ewha Womans University Namkung Gon was arrested for perjury charges. * On January 12, former Culture Minister Kim Jong-deok and two other former senior officials were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the blacklisting. * On January 18, former dean of Ewha Womans University college of science and industry convergence Kim Kyung-Sook was arrested for charges of granting special admission for Chung Yoo-ra. * On January 21, Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun was arrested for drawing up a blacklist of cultural figures critical of President Park. Former Presidential Chief of Staff Kim Ki-Choon was also arrested for masterminding the blacklist containing 10,000 cultural figures considered \\"left-leaning\\" who were critical of President Park. Ewha Womans University Professor Lee In-sung was also arrested. * On February 15, former Ewha Womans University president Choi Kyung Hee was arrested over charges of granting admission and grading favors to Chung Yoo-ra, a daughter of Choi Soon-sil. * On February 16, vice president of Samsung, Lee Jae-yong (JY Lee), was arrested on bribery charges. Mr. Lee is accused of paying $36 million in bribes to Choi Soon-sil, in return for political favors. * In November 2017 as part of further investigations into corruption during the Park presidency two former National Intelligence Service directors Nam Jae-joon and Lee Byung-kee were arrested for embezzlement and bribery. They were arrested for illegally funneling tens of thousands of U.S. dollars a month from their spy agency's secret budget for Park's private use through her presidential office budget.http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20171117000598 . Retrieved 11 February 2018. Arrest of Park Geun-hye On 30 March 2017 the Seoul Central District Court issued a warrant for Park's arrest on corruption charges. She was arrested later that day. Parliamentary hearing On 6 December, chiefs of South Korea's major conglomerates (chaebols) came to the National Assembly to attend the first parliamentary hearing on the scandal involving President Park Geun-hye and her long-time confidante Choi Soon-sil. It happened for the first time since 1988. Participants included Samsung Electronics Vice Chair Lee Jae-yong, Hyundai Motor Chair Chung Mong-koo, Lotte Group Chair Shin Dong-bin, SK Group Chair Chey Tae-won and the heads of CJ, LG, Hanwha and Hanjin, The Federation of Korean Industries. In the hearing, presidents of the chaebols told the parliament that they were not seeking favours when they made contributions to two foundations at the heart of a scandal that appeared poised to bring down President Park Geun-hye. On 7 December 2016, President Park's former aides, including ex-chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and former Vice Culture Minister Kim Jong, testified in the 2nd parliamentary hearing about suspicions that Choi Soon-sil meddled in government affairs. On 14 December 2016, the Special Committee of the Parliament held a 3rd hearing, focused on solving the mystery surrounding President Park's 7-hour public absence on the day of the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking. On 15 December 2016, the Special Committee held a 4th hearing to question the allegations over Mir and K-Sports foundation and how Chung Yoo-ra cheated her way through Ewha Womans University. Jeong Hyun-sik, a former K-Sports head and former Ewha Womans University president Choi Kyung-hee and other affiliated people testified in the hearing. On 22 December 2016, a 5th hearing was held to question former Presidential Secretary Woo Byung-woo and former presidential nurse Cho Yeo-ok. On 26 December 2016, special committee members of National Assembly held a 6th hearing in a prison and met Choi Soon- sil in her detention cell; she repeatedly refused to attend a parliamentary hearing. She denied most of her allegations over the influence-peddling scandal. On 9 January 2017, a 7th hearing was held to question Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun, former chief of admissions at Ewha Womans University Namkung Gon, K-Sports Foundation Chairman Chung Dong Chun and a staffer at the presidential security office Ku Soon-sung. The hearing confirmed that a blacklist for left-leaning artists existed. Public apology and presidential approval rating falls  Park Geun-hye's presidential approval ratings fell to as low as 4% - Gallup Korea Park Geun-hye Approval ratings by age On October 25, 2016, President Park publicly acknowledged her close ties with Choi and apologized to the public. On October 28, Park dismissed key members of her top office staff while her approval ratings fell to 5%. Her approval rating ranged from 1 to 3% for Korean citizens under 60 years of age, while it remained higher at 13% for over 60 years age group. It was the worst ever presidential approval rating in the Korean history and even lower than the 6% approval rating of former President Kim Young-sam, who was widely blamed for failing the Korean economy, which eventually led to the Asian Financial Crisis. On November 4, President Park apologized for the second time. On November 29, Park offered to resign as President and invited the National Assembly to arrange a transfer of power. The opposition parties rejected the offer, accusing Park of attempting to avoid the process of impeachment.  Protests  Protest held in November 2016 The revelations about the relationship between Park Geun-hye and Choi Soon-sil caused mass demonstrations in Seoul. Protesters called for the resignation of Park Geun-hye. On November 12, more than 1 million citizens participated in the protests at Gwanghwamun Square close to presidential residence demanding President Park's resignation or impeachment. On November 19, another 1 million citizens participated in the national protest after President Park refused to help the investigation of her abuse of power. On November 26, more than 2 million citizens participated in the protest, calling for the resignation of President Park. Protests went on, and on January 21, 2017, a 13th protest was held in Seoul with more than 200,000 attendees.  Impeachment process  On December 5, 2016, three opposition parties agreed to introduce a joint impeachment motion against President Park Geun-hye. The motion, which was signed by 171 of 300 lawmakers, was put to a vote on Friday, 9 December 2016, and passed with 234 out of 300 votes, a tally much greater than the required 2/3 majority and which included many of Park's own ruling party.  Court hearing and trial  On December 19, Choi Soon-sil attended the first hearing in the trial of President Park in Seoul District Court. In the first hearing, prosecutors say Choi used their relationship to pressure companies to donate to two foundations, and siphoned off money for personal use. However, she denies the allegations that she influenced the president. On January 5, 2017, constitutional court began its first trial regarding President Park's impeachment. On January 16, 2017, Choi Soon-sil testified herself in the Constitutional Court and denied any wrongdoings. The Constitutional Court declared that it will hold the final pleading from President Park on Feb. 24, suggesting that the court will make a decision on the impeachment trial before March 13. On March 10, the court issued a unanimous ruling, confirming the impeachment proposal and removing President Park from office.

Origins Brixton Greyhound stadium was a short lived greyhound racing stadium which was built extremely quickly from early June until late August 1932. The site chosen for the build was in a built up area off the Brixton Road at the junction of Knowle Road. The official address was 344 Brixton Road and the construction of the stadium also brought about a new school, shops and flats to Angell Town and the Brixton Road. Opening The original plan to open during August 1932 was delayed by one month and the official opening night was on Saturday 10 September 1932. A maximum capacity crowd of four thousand people attended with a further two thousand spectators refused admittance. The 'house full' signs were posted well before the scheduled 8pm start in both the cheap enclosure (one shilling, two pence) and the more expensive two shillings, four pence enclosure. The electric floodlighting was a much discussed topic throughout the Stadium Club terrace and it was also noted that residents in the top floor flats in Knowle Road were watching with field glasses and the Brixton Road residents were hanging out of the upper windows to gain a view. The seven race card featured races over 400 yards and the track was affiliated to the British Greyhound Tracks Control Society (BGTCS), the larger National Greyhound Racing Society. The first winner was 'Ballinadrimna' in a time of 27.90 secs. The chairman of the company was Sir Francis Curtis and he presented the silver cups and cash awards to all of the winners. History Further meetings were held on the Monday, Wednesday and Thursday overseen by the Racing Manager J.J.Compton formerly of Reading and Arms Park stadiums. There was no room for resident kennels in the immediate vicinity so therefore the greyhounds were kept at Bombers Farm on the Grays Road in Westerham, Kent nearly twenty miles away. In December 1932 the track like many others at the time suffered totalisator problems with the authorities investigating the use of the tote on course following legislation that had banned them. Notable boxing matches were hosted by the stadium in the 1930s before the BGTCS disbanded in 1935 which resulted in the stadium operating as an independent track. Closure The exact date of closure is unknown but it did close before World War II. Brixton suffered considerable bomb damage including one bomb that fell adjacent to the stadium in Knowle Road. After the war the stadium was demolished and many of the nearby slums were cleared making way for council houses. The site became a depot before the St Helens School was constructed there. The track would have existed on part of the school and the Bedwell House flats opposite Villa Road and Max Roach Park.

Born in Boedo, city of Buenos Aires, Iglesias grew up imitating his idol, Luis Artime, a notable forward of the 1960s. He spent his youth career at San Lorenzo de Almagro, debuting in Primera División at 18, in 1976 in a match v. Unión de Santa Fe. Iglesias scored his first goal in Primera that same day, by penalty shoot-out. Alberto Rendo was the coach of San Lorenzo by then. Iglesias would be later transferred to Sarmiento de Junín, where he became top scorer of the team that won the 1980 Primera B championship. Iglesias had a long career as scorer, becoming an idol for the Sarmiento de Junín and Racing Club de Avellaneda supporters.\\"Mis goles fueron todos muy feos\\", Interview to Iglesias by Alejandro Wall - Un Caño Despite of not having a technique or ball control, Iglesias was a temible striker because of his speed and heading, being mostly notable for his conditions as scorer. Iglesias was the Primera B Nacional top scorer at the 1986-87 season playing for Huracán (which also promoted to Primera División) where he scored 36 goals in 37 matches, setting a record for the division.José Iglesias on Enciclopedia de Huracán After his tenure on El Globito, Iglesias was traded to Racing Club, where he became an idol for its supporters who also dedicated him a song. Iglesias formed a praised attacking line along with wingers Ramón Medina Bello and Walter Fernández, with the addition of midfielder Miguel Colombatti and Uruguayan playmaker Rubén Paz. His most remembered match playing for Racing was a smashing victory over Boca Juniors by 6–0, with two goals by Iglesias.Racing le daba una 'paliza' histórica a Boca en el Cilindro, Infobae, 19 September 2013 Like Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Iglesias' trademark was to perform a celebratory somersault after each goal he scored.

The reserve has the capacity to support 750 families. There are eleven scattered communities in the reserve. The Grande da Barreira Lake area has seven communities, the Curuçá Lake area has two communities and there are two communities on the Paraná do Urariá. Most of the residents are engaged in farming, fishing or extraction of forest resources. They gain income from sale of cassava flour, fish, Brazil nuts and guaraná fruit, and raise cattle on a small scale. History The Urariá Sustainable Development Reserve was created by municipal decree 40 of 20 November 2001. The main purpose was to manage the intense exploitation of fish stocks in the lake area, while relieving the poverty of the residents. From the start, the reserve followed the principles of sustainable development, improvements to the quality of life of the residents and respect for the environment. The municipality created the Instituto de Desenvolvimento Sustentável de Maués (IDS Maués) to manage the reserve, and the Agroambiental Consultoria e Organização Projetos Ltda., a social organization with an office in Manaus.

He began on Broadway and Vaudeville as part of a comedy team with Ken Brown in the 1920s. By 1939 he had moved to Hollywood, where he worked as an assistant director, before getting his opportunity to helm his own films with 1945's Leave It to Blondie. He was married at least twice, his first wife, Jean, committed suicide after arguing with him; his second wife was B-movie actress Iris Meredith. Life and career Berlin was born in New York City on August 7, 1907. By the late 1920s he had teamed up Ken Brown as a comedy song/dance duo, who performed on both Broadway and on the Vaudeville circuit. The team had garnered the nickname the \\"Two Knights of Knonsense\\". In the 1930s he moved to Hollywood, and was working as an assistant director on films by the end of the decade, many of them in the Blondie franchise. His first film as 1939's Blondie Takes a Vacation. Over the next six years, he would assist on nineteen movies. Outside of the Blondie films, he would work on such notable productions as Go West, Young Lady (1941), City Without Men (1943), Sahara (1943), What a Woman! (1943), The Boy from Stalingrad (1943), The Impatient Years (1944), and 1945's A Song to Remember. In 1945 he was given the opportunity to helm his own picture, Leave It to Blondie. It was the first film after Columbia re-booted the series. He directed a total of twelve feature films, nine of which were in the Blondie franchise. His other features included the romantic comedy, Father Is a Bachelor (1950 - which he co-directed with Norman Foster), which stars William Holden and Coleen Gray; and the 1950 crime drama, Double Deal. With the advent of television, Berlin moved to the small screen, where he directed on numerous series, including Blondie, Lassie, and The Ann Sothern Show. His direction of William Bendix in transforming the radio program to the small screen, was credited with making The Life of Riley a success. In 1965 he would return to the big screen one last time, as an assistant director on The Great Sioux Massacre. On August 19, 1965 Berlin died shortly after working on The Great Sioux Massacre, before it opened in September. Berlin was married at least twice. During the 1930s he married actress Jean Berlin. Just as he was beginning his directing career, in November 1939, the couple had an argument. Afterwards, Jean committed suicide by poisoning herself. Later, in 1943, he married Iris Meredith, when the two eloped to Yuma, Arizona while he was working on Sahara. The two remained married to until his death in 1965.

The plot revolves around the fighter pilots and auxiliary personnel of a fictional Spitfire squadron in September 1940. At the beginning of the story a newly trained 19-year-old pilot, Peter Stuyckes (pronounced \\"Stewks\\") arrives at Westhill (a fictitious Home Counties aerodrome near a fictitious town called Melbury), joining an established squadron already in the thick of the fighting. Less than a week later, after a number of aerial battles and many sub-plots concerning airmen and ground staff alike, the squadron is rotated to Lincolnshire for rest and refit, having suffered many casualties. This was the eighth novel to be released by Trevor under his own name although he had published many other titles under pseudonyms. Plot summary Pilot Officer Stuyckes arrives at Westhill and immediately suffers a mishap on a borrowed bicycle on presenting himself at his new Flight. This provokes mild amusement among his fellows and presages a near-disaster when, on being taken up for an introductory flight by Squadron Leader Charlie Mason, he is so preoccupied with making a textbook landing approach that he forgets to lower his undercarriage and has to be sarcastically reminded. Keen to make an impression, he succeeds in downing a German bomber on his first sortie but is attacked and seriously damaged, forcing him to make a belly landing for real although impressing the ground staff with how well he manages this. While the green Stuyckes is adapting to life on the front line, it is seen that the more experienced members of Westhill Squadron (codenamed \\"Vestal\\" and never referred to by number in the book) have their own share of problems. Even Charlie Mason, regarded as invincible by many of the squadron, is beginning to suffer doubt before the end of the story, and many characters do worse: * Bob White is suffering from battle fatigue, having earlier flown in France and over Dunkirk, and the conviction that he is fated to die soon. After he breaks down in a drunken rage, he is sent on leave to recover even though Mason and the station medical officer privately agree that he will probably kill himself anyway. * Macklin, another veteran of the Battle of France, dies on Stuyckes' second sortie when his plane hits the ground (mentioned by another character during debriefing). * Hodges, convinced that his wife has been killed in a Luftwaffe raid on Southampton but unable to make contact by telephone, first disposes of five enemy aircraft and then crashes his Spitfire into a sixth (in accordance with one of Mason's dicta, that given the balance of strength at that time in the battle, losing one fighter for five of the enemy destroyed is still a net loss for the R.A.F.). A later call from Southampton police confirms that Mrs Hodges has indeed died, but that Hodges could not possibly have known this. * Brewer is attacked, cut off from the rest of the squadron, while his repeated calls for assistance (\\"Can anyone get that bastard?\\") go unanswered and apparently unheard, and eventually shot down by his persistent attacker. * Spencer, Mason's closest friend, allows his attention to wander for a short time in a battle, leading him to spend three seconds in a Me109's gunsight and take a three-second burst from its spinner-cannon, destroying his Spitfire instantly. The previous night, Spencer had opted not to sleep with his girlfriend in order to get a good night's rest before returning to action, and Mason had told him that he was to be nominated for a Bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross. On going through Spencer's personal effects, Mason finds a letter stating that he, Spencer, had a premonition that he was to die soon and hoped that when it came it was quick and did not inconvenience the rest of the squadron. In connection with Hodges's earlier death, this leads Mason to wonder if he too will experience the same foreknowledge of his own death. * Carsman, a tough Northerner transferred to Westhill as a replacement a few days after Stuyckes's arrival, is listed as a casualty along with Stuart and Rooke in the final chapter. Stuyckes continues to experience an uphill struggle. On another early mission he is forced to bail out (sustaining superficial injuries after landing in a bramble patch), leading one of the WAAFs, twenty-year-old Daisy Caplin, who feels a strong sisterly attachment to him, to believe he has been killed when he does not return with the rest of the squadron. After a WAAF officer, who herself is hiding her own grief over a letter she is carrying in her uniform pocket, has interviewed Daisy and delicately inquired if she is illicitly pregnant (the phrase used is \\"Are you in trouble?\\"), Daisy sees Stuyckes walking around and only then learns that he had parachuted to safety and made his own way back to base. At the end of the story, Stuyckes is in hospital after a more severe crash-landing, although making light of his injuries and well enough to pester the hospital staff to allow him to telephone Mason to inquire after the squadron's welfare. The squadron has already made its last operation before relocating to Lincolnshire and was able to fly off only seven aircraft (out of twelve) in response to a raid on the aerodrome itself, of whom at least three are mentioned as killed in Mason's conversation with Stuyckes. In addition to Mason himself and the injured Stuyckes, only two other pilots are mentioned as being alive, including one (Collins) who has been a byword for escaping by parachute throughout the story and has done so again. Throughout the story, various romantic entanglements are explored. There is a suggestion that Stuyckes had his first sexual experience with a woman named Marcia on the night before he arrived at Westhill; two of the ground staff, both unhappily married, have a passionate affair which is abruptly ended by the transfer of one of them to Oban; and Mason himself becomes aware that Felicity, actually a local heiress working as a war volunteer in the WRVS while hosting five schoolboy evacuees, is strongly attracted to him. Despite the squadron's relocation to Lincolnshire, Mason resolves to return as soon as he has leave, as he finds himself returning Felicity's affection with equal force. The book closes with the departure of the last survivors of the squadron, other than the hospitalised Stuyckes, and the arrival of a new squadron at the damaged but still operational aerodrome. Technical error In Chapter Seven, Leading Aircraftman Cornelius is paraded before Flight Lieutenant Robey to be disciplined for \\"breaking out of camp\\" (in this case, a short unauthorised absence, not via the official exit, to socialise privately with a WAAF). Robey punishes him with a reprimand. There are several issues with this: * Cornelius and his fellows are relieved that the punishment is not more severe. In fact, a reprimand is considered a more serious punishment than would normally be imposed for a minor offence and the \\"Confined to Camp\\" punishment imposed on his girlfriend carries less weight although both speak of it as if it were more. * A Leading Aircraftman is not an NCO and hence is too junior to be reprimanded.Air Ministry wartime training notes on military discipline and justice * Robey is mentioned later as being specifically concerned not to harass engineers and fitters given the extreme hard work they are performing at this crucial stage of the Battle of Britain. It is likely that the author confused the term \\"reprimand\\" with \\"admonishment\\". A person who is admonished is awarded a documented scolding which is considered far lighter than an official reprimand (and which can be applied to personnel below NCO rank). Later in the book, Cornelius is spoken to by Mason, after ignoring orders to take shelter while the station was under attack and Mason mentions a severe reprimand as a possible consequence for any repetition.\\"If you ignore my personal order the next time, you'll be on a charge, and you won't get away with a severe rep.\\" p225, Heinemann hardback edition, 1972 reprint, 434 79307 8 (Mason also thanks Cornelius for his bravery and undertakes to recommend him for a decoration.) Chronology No dates are mentioned during the book, but the reference to a raid on Southampton http://sussexhistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=6082.0 and the arrival of unusually large Luftwaffe formations a few days later along with bombing attacks on towns would suggest that the story begins on or about the 10th of September 1940.

History The report was produced in March 1968 by Frederick Dainton, Baron Dainton FRS, who was the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nottingham. In October 1966 there were 1,600 vacant places in the science and technology faculties of British universities. Sheffield-born Fred Dainton was a Professor of Chemistry for fifteen years, researching radiation chemistry, and was later knighted in 1971. He died in December 1997. The report was published by the Dainton Committee of the Department for Education and Science.Dainton Committee The Dainton Committee was formed in 1965 by the Council for Scientific Policy. Content The report found that there was a reduction in the numbers of people entering science and engineering at university. The report was also known as the Enquiry into the Flow of Candidates in Science and Technology into Higher Education. Around 40,000 of those at sixth-form were studying science in 1964; he predicted this would lower to around 30,000 in 1971, when the total numbers in sixth-form would rise from 107,000 to 130,000. One fifth of those taking science at sixth-form were female. In 1962 around 42% were opting for science at school, but by 1967 it was 31%; it was predicted this would lower to 25% by 1971. 45.9% of university admissions were to science courses, which had lowered to 40.6% in 1967. At the same time, those opting to study social sciences at university was rapidly increasing, doubling in proportion from 1962 to 1967. The report wanted to improve the position of science, technology, and engineering in the education system, and society. The report wanted to increase the supply of scientists and technologists, which the report claimed, was limited by the immature and misinformed choices of 13 and 14 year olds at school, making premature decisions, often unfavourable to a career in science or technology. The report claimed that fewer people were choosing science, because of schools making 13 or 14 year olds decide between either arts or sciences. The report wanted to create less irrevocable decisions at school, where science was not part of that decision. 14 year olds were deciding not to study science, which was largely irrevocable. The report had found that heavy factual content of science courses had deterred 14 year olds from choosing science. The cut-off point of studying science for many at school was the age of 14. Recommendations * All should study Mathematics until the end of secondary school, and should study arts and sciences. * Those in the sixth form should study five subjects, not just two or three. The five subjects should include Mathematics, a science, a social study and a language. * University entrance should be based on five subjects, not three. * Universities should not know the individual A-level results of each candidate, but receive a grade as a whole for all the examinations taken - an overall grade. * Universities should provide refresher courses for teachers in the latest know-how, and should not wait for teachers to come to them, but actively visit schools. * Science teaching should contain less arid rote learning and dreary experiments, and should be more relevant to human experience. * Mathematics should be seen as not only preparation for becoming a scientist, but for application in other walks of life, such as decision making and with organisation. Effect The Schools Council had also recommended to universities that entrance should be two GCE A-level passes, with four elective courses chosen by individual schools. Universities were asked to reply to the report later in 1968.

The league was founded in January 1884 when the Union League of Professional Base Ball Clubs added four teams and dissolved to reform as the Eastern League. In 1887, the first Eastern League was absorbed into the International League. History=Establishment On January 4, 1884, representatives of the Union League of Professional Base Ball Clubs met in Philadelphia to discuss affairs of their organization in the coming year.\\"Base Ball News,\\" Freeport [IL] Journal-Standard, Jan. 5, 1884, pg. 2.

Observers were also present from established teams outside the league, including the Philadelphia Athletics, the New York Metropolitans, and the Buffalo Bisons. New clubs were admitted to the league for the coming year located in Newark and Trenton, New Jersey as well as Harrisburg and Allentown, Pennsylvania, bringing the total number of teams for the Eastern League at the time of its founding to eight. A bid was made by a representative of a team located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, but the request for admission was declined.\\"It Is the Eastern League,\\" Reading Times, Jan. 5, 1884, pg. 1. On the second day of their gathering the assembled representatives voted to change the name of their league to the Eastern League of Professional Base Ball Clubs. According to one newspaper account of the day, the decision to change the league's name was related to a desire to avoid confusion with the rival Union Association of Base Ball Clubs.\\"The Eastern League: The Union League of Professional Ball Clubs Changes Its Name,\\" Philadelphia Times, Jan. 5, 1884, pg. 2. The formation of the new league effectively put an end not only to the Union League from whence it sprung, but also tolled the death knell of the short- lived Inter-State Professional Base-Ball Association, which had included teams from Allentown, Harrisburg, Reading, Trenton, and Wilmington.\\"The National Game,\\" Chicago Tribune, Jan. 3, 1884, pg. 1. The Eastern League played baseball according to the rules of the American Association, with only minor modifications. Rules changes unique to the Eastern League included a provision that batters must run after receiving three strikes or seven balls. The completion of five full innings was deemed sufficient for a complete game to have been played in the event of darkness or rain. In a change from past practice, teams were also required to remove \\"all obnoxious persons from the grounds in the space of fifteen minutes\\" under penalty of forfeiture of the game. The inaugural season was to run from May 1 to October 1, 1884. Each team in the association to play a 98 game season in which every team was to play each other a total of 14 times during the year. Four regular and two substitute umpires were to be provided by the league, sufficient to handle the 8-team league's possible four daily match ups; in the event of absence of an official umpire, the visiting team was to name the replacement, subject to that individual's not being associated with the visiting club himself. Governance The Eastern League was to be governed by a 7-member executive, consisting of a President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer, and a four member Board of Directors, all to be elected at the annual meeting of teams. President of the league in 1884 was W.C. Seddon of Richmond, Virginia. The Eastern League was to be governed by annual meetings to be held each year in Philadelphia on the second Wednesday of January. Annual dues were $100 per club, with $500 of this amount going to pay the salary of the league's permanent Secretary. The Eastern League was anxious to become signatories to the so-called tripartite national agreement between the National League, American Association, and the Northwestern League which governed mutual respect of player contracts and other matters. To this end, a meeting of the three signatories to the national agreement was called for May 5, 1884 to ratify the Eastern League's request.\\"A Change in the Name,\\" Reading Times, vol. 52, no. 118 (Feb. 18, 1884), pg. 1. The Union Association of Base Ball Clubs stood in opposition to this agreement and was a bitter rival in the battle for organizational hegemony. 1884 teams The following teams were slated to play in the Eastern League as of January 1884. Monumental Club of Baltimore and Quickstep Club of Wilmington ended up playing in the short-lived Union Association instead, the latter as a late-season replacement team after starting the year in the Eastern League. * Active Club — Reading, Pennsylvania * Allentown Club — Allentown, Pennsylvania * Domestic Club — Newark, New Jersey * Harrisburg Club — Harrisburg, Pennsylvania * Monumental Club — Baltimore, Maryland * Quickstep Club — Wilmington, Delaware * Trenton Club — Trenton, New Jersey * Virginia Club — Richmond, Virginia.

A study in exaggeration The title given by Abstemius to his story was “The man who told his wife he had laid an egg” (De viro qui uxori se ovum peperisse dixerat), with the moral that one should not tell a woman anything one wishes to keep secret.Secundum Hecatomythium 129 Roger L'Estrange translated it two centuries later under the title “A woman trusted with a secret”.Fable 427 Wishing to test his wife, who swears that she can be trusted to keep silent, a husband tells her one night that he has just laid an egg. Scarcely had dawn broken than the woman left her bed to tell a neighbour, who does not hesitate to pass it on with exaggerations of her own. By nightfall after a day of busy gossip, the man is reported to have laid forty eggs. In 1763, Rowland Rugeley went on to intensify the irony of the ending in his paraphrase of La Fontaine’s later version, shifting from the simplicity of village life to an urban emphasis on credulity. “Some from this strange phaenomenon,/ Presag’d misfortune to the town,/The fall of States, the death of Kings,/And many more surprising things.”Miscellaneous poems and translations from La Fontaine and others, pp.126-8 However suited to the end of the 15th century may have been Abstemius’ bare anecdote, it needed La Fontaine’s seasoned craft as a fabulist to adapt it to the spirit of Renaissance France. Outwardly he did so by exaggerating it further in the telling. The man pretends to lay the egg while in bed with his wife and obtains her promise to stay silent. But since “nothing is so heavy to bear as a secret”, she betrays it while it is scarcely light, enjoining secrecy in her turn. This time the number of eggs is swelled by repetition to more than a hundred by day’s end.English translation More subtly, although the story seems told against women, La Fontaine hints at gender reversal throughout the story. At the very start he points out that where gossip is concerned “Many men are women too”. The husband takes on the female role by his imposture, in consequence of which he is referred to as ‘the egg-layer’ (le pondeur) later in the narration. Online commentary Similar reversals of exclusive prejudice occurred in Creole versions of the fable. Gossip “is a failing of negresses, you say,/ But they’re no weaker than a white that way,” argued François Marbot (1817-66) of Martinique in Les Bambous (1846).Fable 21 And Rodolphine Young from the Seychelles followed him further in challenging prejudice: “Black women have this weakness, true,/ But whites are even weaker.”Fable 48 Adaptations In France there were two dramatic adaptations of the fable. That of 1767 was the one-act comic opera Les femmes et le secret by François- Antoine Quêtant (1733- 1823) and Pierre Vachon.Text on Google Books It was followed in 1823 by a similarly titled one-act comedy with musical interludes by W. Lafontaine and Gaspard Touret.Google Books The 1843 vaudeville by Edouard Deaddé Saint-Yves and Léon de Villier only borrowed the title and applied it to another situation.Google Books There was also a silent film made in 1909 by the Gaumont Film Company.IMDB Book illustrations of the fable often picture one woman talking to another, or to a group, with a finger raised to her lips to indicate that the story should go no further, as in the 19th century engraving by Tony Johannot.Old Book Illustrations The same gesture persists into Maguy Bourzeix’s modern update of the situation.Biennale Internationale Tinchebray 2012 It seems implied too in Gerard Stricher’s more abstract treatment of the women’s heads in his painting of 2015.Art Majeur References Category:Fables by Laurentius Abstemius Category:La Fontaine's Fables ","title":"The Women and the Secret"},{"id":"52131540","title":"2016–17 Blackwater Elite season"},{"id":"52131546","text":"Tom Tachell was an Australian professional tennis player who the 1905 Australian Championships (with Randolph Lycett) in men's doubles  Grand slam finals = Doubles (1 title)  {class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" !style=\\"width:45px\\"Result !style=\\"width:40px\\"Year !style=\\"width:180px\\"Championship !style=\\"width:50px\\"Surface !style=\\"width:160px\\"Partner !style=\\"width:160px\\"Opponents !style=\\"width:170px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -style=\\"background:#ffc;\\"  style=\\"background:#98fb98;\\"Winn 1905 Australian Championships  Grass  Randolph Lycett  Edgar T.

Early life George, the eldest son of George Tupman (1785–1847) and Elizabeth Emerson, was born at Boulogne-sur-Mer on 7 September 1838 and was educated for eight and a half years at the Royal Naval School, where he showed an interest in mathematical and scientific subjects. As an officer in the Royal Marine Artillery he served on H.M.S. Sidon at Rio and at the Cape and on H.M.S. Forte at Montevideo, then on H.M.S. Prince Consort in the Mediterranean. He kept an album from the 1850s, which includes his watercolour sketches of ships he sailed on and places he visited, that has been digitised. Tupman was particularly interested in astronomy, and was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society from May 1863. Whilst in the Mediterranean between 1869 and 1871 he observed about 300 meteor trails. He was one of the first people to make estimates of the velocity of meteors. Role in the 1874 Transit of Venus Expeditions In 1872, on his return from sea, Tupman was assigned to assist with the British expeditions to observe the 1874 Transit of Venus, soon being appointed as head instructor. The Transit Expedition project was overseen by George Biddell Airy, but historian Jessica Ratcliff notes that Tupman was 'manager, observer and calculator' and that his involvement 'went deeper than Airy's.' Tupman oversaw recruitment and training of the team of observers (including with the use of a clockwork model), and organised the equipment and transport for all five official British expeditions. These were to Egypt, the Sandwich Islands, Rodriguez Island, New Zealand and Kerguelen Island. He went as chief astronomer on the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands expedition and observed the transit of Venus from the main station at Honolulu, as well as making many observations to determine longitude. After returning to Greenwich, via a trans-continental rail journey across the US, he spent around four years working without pay on the data that had been collected on the five expeditions. Tupman's official journals for his time spend at Greenwich from 1872–1880 and his time at the Honolulu observing station, as well as his private journal for 1875, are available online. Tupman (and his wife Rebecca, who he had married in 1876) observed the 1882 transit of Venus from Burnham near Christchurch, New Zealand. Later life Tupman maintained his interest in astronomy, and reported numerous occultations between 1885 and 1900. He was on the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society (1873–1880), and was also appointed its Secretary (1884–1889). He also established the Hillfoot Observatory in Harrow, and enjoyed helping visitors to make observations. Tupman's interests later in life included wireless telegraphy. He died at Observatory, College Road, Harrow, on 22 November 1922 at the age of 84, and was buried at Pinner Road Cemetery, Harrow. His wife Rebecca (née Wetherill), known as Beckie, survived him by only a few months.  Legacy  Tupman published an Account of Observations of the Transit of Venus, 1874, 8 December: Made Under the Authority of the British Government: and of the Reduction of the Observations in 1881. He published other astronomical observations regularly in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and elsewhere. As well as a selection of Tupman's official and private papers relating to the Transit of Venus enterprise, the recent digital collection contains The Life & Adventures of Station B, two albums of caricatures by Lieutenant Evelyn Noble, one of the Honolulu observers. These include many drawings of Tupman and the other observers at work and leisure during their travels and while in Honolulu.

It is located on the Bor Plateau, south of Mount Hasan near a spring. Description  The site is a limestone hill, which had already been turned into terraces for settlement purposes in the Neolithic. This settlement had an area of circa 100 90 metres and left behind some 6 metres of strata. The uppermost layer (I) dates to the early Chalcolithic (c. 5000-4750 BC), while the layers below this (II-V) belong to the Neolithic period and have been dated by radio carbon dating to 6300-5600 BC.Mihriban Özbaşaran, \\"The Neolithic on the Plateau.\\" In Gregory McMahon, Sharon Steadman (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Ancient Anatolia: 10,000-323 BCE. Oxford, Oxford University Press, Online Publication Date: Nov 2012 . In the upper, Chalcolithic layer, a workshop with a furnace for copper-working was discovered. In all the Neolithic layers, the houses have a trapezoidal or quadrilateral floor plan with between two and four rooms. These houses contain, at least, a clay platform and a fireplace, with storage containers in almost every room. Several buildings had out-buildings attached to them. The houses were joined together in blocks with a narrow, angular street network and a number of open areas running between them.

Setting The Middlesex–Winooski River Bridge is located northwest of the village center of Middlesex, in the Winooski River floodplain. The river flows north at the crossing, ultimately heading northwesterly to Burlington and Lake Champlain. The bridge is set at an angle on concrete abutments and pier, with an orientation from southeast to northwest. The bridge was built in 2010. Historic bridge The historic bridge was set in a similar orientation to the modern bridge. It had two long spans, each , carried by Pratt through trusses, and short girder span at the north end. The bridge trusses were fabricated by the American Bridge Company and the bridge was completed in 1928. In 1927, this part of the Winooski River watershed was subjected some of the state's most devastating flooding. US 2 was at that time the principal road artery between Burlington and Montpelier, and many bridges (both highway and railroad) were either swept away or suffered significant damage, resulting in the isolation of Middlesex village.

The Onorati used a dual-bolt system and fed from two 20-round detachable box magazines inserted into the weapon.  Variants  ; SMG The standard SMG with a wood stock; magazines are inserted into the weapon and stored under the handguard. ; Pistol A machine pistol variant of the same weapon, which has a normal pistol grip instead of a stock acting as a grip.

The state of emergency authorizes the military to enforce security nationwide. It also imposes restrictions on freedom of speech and access to information. Media have reported the state of emergency’s duration was announced for six months. The Constitution of Ethiopia provides for a six-month state of emergency under certain conditions. The government’s declaration of state of emergency followed massive protests by the Oromo and Amhara ethic groups against the government, which is controlled by people in the Tigrayan ethnic group, a smaller ethnic minority. It is the first time in approximately 25 years that a state of emergency has been declared in Ethiopia. In March 2017, Ethiopia’s parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for another four months. Historical background Ethiopia, one of the oldest states in the world, has a great history of victory against the colonial powers. Ethiopia's more than 80 ethnic groups have lived together in harmony for generations. The diversity of ethnicity is beautiful, but it has also negative impacts in the unity of the state. After the downfall of Mengistu Haile Mariam's military regime in 1991, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front took over power. The first thing it did was to implement a Federal system of government in the country. It was not an easy task to implement a federal government system in a country like Ethiopia. This is because the country was a unitary state for more than three thousand years. Another reason for difficulty is that federalism is based on ethnic and language backgrounds. After implementing the federal system,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/399077/pdf ethnic based federal system there was different ethnic based conflict. The source for those conflicts goes to natural resources, lands, and others factors. In some scholars view those are not the main factor for the ethnic conflicts, “it’s because of the implementation of ethnic based federalism.” A couple of months before the state of emergency was declared, U.S. State Department officials criticized Ethiopia (historically a strong ally) for how it was dealing with protestors. U.S. Ambassador on human rights Tom Malinkowski wrote (in remarks later attributed to Secretary of State Kerry by the L.A. Times) \\"security forces have continued to use excessive force to prevent Ethiopians from congregating peacefully, killing and injuring many people and arresting thousands.\\"  Oromo opposition and Amhara resistance  After 25 years of leading this country, the Ethiopian government is facing opposition from all directions of the country. The two major ethnic groups—the Oromo and the Amhara—together represent approximately 61.4% of the country’s population, and the Oromo started a resistance movement against the Tigray-dominated government that began in November 2015. This movement went to different parts of the country. Corruption, poor administration, injustice, lack of equal economic benefits and losing their land in the name of investments are some of the causes that triggered the movement. The situation with the opposition became particularly difficult in October 2016. Due to corruption in the country, human rights violations and lack of equal economic benefits, the opposition has been accepted by most protesters. On October 2, there was an annual Oromo religious festival called Irreechaa, a festival where people from the entire Oromia region come and give thanks to their God in a city named Bishoftu. Bishoftu is approximately 50 km (30 miles) from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital. During this festival people all Oromo people come to give thanks to their god. In this event, people started shouting and showing different signs and protesting the government.http://www.tadias.com/10/02/2016/ethiopia-deadly-stampede-at- protest-during-irrecha-festival-in-bishoftu/ Bishoftu Police fired tear gas into a crowd of people protesting the government at this festival, which was attended by approximately two million people; this resulted in a stampede and more than 50 deaths.  Political implication  Those who supported what the government did to stop the opposition say “it was the right and the only decision to stop further destruction and conflicts between different ethnic conflicts. And the government is responsible to protect the country peace so the measure taken was right and necessary.” Whereas another group that strongly blames the government for the measure taken during the festivals says “people have the right to express their feeling anywhere and anytime. So the government needs to respect this right of their own people.” Although it is not clear if the measure taken by the government was necessary or not, or proportional or not, this was an immediate reason that led the people all over the Oromia region to go out for the opposition. People started to burn the government property and also foreign investor’s property. After the government’s call for an immediate council of minister’s meeting, the government declared a six-month state of emergency. Due to this, most rights will be suspended. The police may arrest people without court arrest warrant and search any house they suspect without search warrant. The following is also prohibited by the government according to this declaration of a State of Emergency: Any kind of demonstration and meeting, watching Ethiopian Satellite Television (which is led by the political groups outside the country), writing articles which will incite people to go for opposition, having any communication with the opposition groups outside the country, having any sign of opposition on mobile phones and laptops, and accessing websites which criticize the government. This action of the government is getting support as well as opposition. These who support the declaration of State of Emergency say that it’s a decision which will save the country from civil war and ethnic conflicts. Whereas some scholars don’t agree with this, saying that the civil war in the country wouldn’t happen. The opposition is targeting the ruling government and not an ethnic group.  FDRE constitution  According to the Ethiopian constitution, the council of ministers has the power to declare the State of Emergency under three conditions: 1) during foreign invasion, 2) during a natural disaster or natural epidemic, and 3) when there is a breakdown of the country’s law and regulation which will endanger the constitutional order.  Impacts The declaration of State of Emergency creates fear in most people. Most adults in the country have a bad experience with states of emergency. During the dictatorial Derg regime the government used violence to quell dissent. There was a state of emergency in which they put curfews on cities. During this time, the police went to different houses and did whatever they wanted. Due to this bad memory, most people get home early. Whereas, others have said “it’s a key to safety”, and the country’s security became better after the declaration of the state of emergency. However, most business in big cities of the country have decreased due to the blockage of internet services. Tourist traffic outside the capital city, Addis Ababa, decreases due to different security reasons. Additionally, most people who live in cities prefer to stay home or go home early rather than working. Most economists also predict that this declaration will highly affect the income of the only internet service provider in the country called Ethio telecom. Restrictions on communication The government tightened restrictions on internet use during the state of emergency. The government shut down the internet for several days, criminalized reporting on protests via social media, and criminalized communicating with exiled dissidents (which are classified by the government as terrorists). Arrests, releases and trials Within two weeks of announcing a state of emergency, the government, by its own count had arrested 1,645 people. Merera Gudina, an Oromo opposition leader, was arrested after testifying before the European Parliament. On November 12, 2016 the government announced the names and reasons for arrest for 11,067 people who were arrested. In late December, Voice of America reported that the government was releasing over 9,000 people who had been arrested since the start of the state of emergency; the government planned to arraign 2,449 others. Deutsche Welle reported in February 2017 that the government claims 20,000 people are arrested in Oromia, while opposition groups claim 70,000 people are arrested; the government has indicated it will release 22,000 prisoners, having released 11,000 prisoners on February 3.

Location McDermott's Castle is located on Castle Island, an island of 0.23 ha (0.57 ac) in the southeast corner of Lough Key. History The Mac Diarmada were the ruling dynasty of Magh Luirg (Moylurg; northeast Connacht) from the 10th to 16th centuries. A castle stood on this island from the 12th century: in 1184, the Annals of Loch Cé report that a lightning bolt caused a fire: A rebuilt castle featured in the final part of the 1235 conquest of Connacht by Richard Mór de Burgh, 1st Baron of Connaught. The castle came under siege, first by a raft-mounted catapult, and then by fire ships. Cormac MacDermott, King of Moylurg, was forced to surrender. A poem addressed to Tomaltach an Einigh mac Diarmata (King of Moylurg 1421–58) tells the story of the Hag of Lough Key who used (or abused) Cormac MacDermott's (king 1218–44) hospitality by staying on the Rock for a full year, and laid upon the McDermotts the obligation of perpetual hospitality. The McDermotts lost the island in 1586. Eochaidh Ó hÉoghusa wrote a poem lamenting the castle's emptiness. In 2014, the island and castle featured in an episode of sitcom Moone Boy, as the residence of the mysterious \\"Island Joe.\\" In 2018, the castle was put up for sale for €80,000. However, the offer was later withdrawn and the castle returned to Irish ownership. In 2016, licensed excavations were undertaken at the nearby Rockingham moated site, suggested (by some interpretations of the Annals of Connacht) to be the remains of a medieval market. This site may have been the landward element of the fortified Rock of Lough Key. The excavation exposed a large enclosure around the moated site dating to the thirteenth century which covered an early medieval ringfort ditch. A large grain drying kiln of indeterminate date was found associated with the moated site. Artifacts discovered on the site firmly placed the date of the moated site to the medieval period. In 2019, Archaeological excavations were also undertaken on the island.https://excavations.ie/report/2019/Roscommon/0029126/ The excavations concluded that the island itself is essentially a multi-period fortification, with the earliest elements dating to the early medieval era. An earlier, two to three meter thick enclosure wall pre-dating the standing enclosure wall was excavated at a depth of a meter and a half. Medieval buildings dating to the thirteenth century were excavated on the northern side of the island above the earlier fortification, but were not found to be connected to the standing enclosure wall. High-status Gaelic artifacts were discovered, including silver pins, a gaming piece, and large collections of butchered cattle, boar, and sheep. The research on the island was featured in Archaeology Magazine.https://www.archaeology.org/issues/371-2003/features/8423-ireland- lough-key-medieval-castle Building View of Castle Island in Lough Key Isaac Weld, writing in 1832, describes as part of \\"the castle proper\\" two rooms, one above the other, each 36 × 22 feet (11 × 7 m), with walls 7½ feet (2.2 m) thick. It is not clear whether this refers to part of the original castle, or the later construction. The standing remains on the island date from at least three distinct periods. The enclosure wall around the island are the earliest standing remains. O'Conor et al. argued that the enclosure wall is probably of medieval construction, but the wall has not been dated, and the excavations by Finan and Schryver were not able to connect the enclosure wall to their excavations.https://webgis.archaeology.ie/historicenvironment/ O'Conor et al. identified a late medieval tower house on the interior of main standing building. An arrow slot and medieval windows are found on the western wall of this tower house. The additions on either side of the tower, as well as the kitchen on the eastern side of the tower, were added by the architect John Nash in the early nineteenth century. At that time, windows were inserted into the later medieval tower house. The enclosure wall was modified on the northern end of the island in order to provide a view from the main window inserted into the tower. It was built as a summer house and burned down during the Second World War.

The force covers elements from the Malaysian Armed Forces, Royal Malaysia Police and the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency. NSOF is the third Task Force attached to the National Security Council (NSC) () after the Federal Special Task Force (PPKPS/L) and Special Malaysia Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (SMART). History / Roles Formed on 27 October 2016 by Prime Minister Najib Razak, the NSOF will serve as the nation's security forces first responders against all threats. The NSOF personnel will be seconded from the three agencies in the initial stage. Designated posts will be made once the unit is fully operational, which reports directly to the National Security Council (NSC). This is to prevent any disruptions to the operations of the agencies involved. Malaysia is the first country in the world to form an integrated security force to respond to terror threats. As of October 2016, the NSOF has 17 officers and 170 special operations personnels from the MAF, RMP and MMEA, who will be based at the Fort Perdana, Sungai Besi. The establishment of the NSOF proves the government's 'no-compromise' attitude in issues of security. NSOF acts as a quick reaction force to curb terrorism in the early stages. The land, air and maritime units will be mobilised as the early group and will confront, fight and eliminate the threats. The main task of NSOF is to eliminate all forms of terrorism on land, air or in the water and to be always prepared to react quickly against threats. Team members will continue Force Integration Training (FIT) to enhance their skills to deal with critical situations and prepare contingency plans for threats to national security and perform other duties as directed. On NSOF's operating procedure, the NSC would report to the Inspector-General of Police and MAF chief in the event of an incident, who would then refer it to him to give the nod to mobilise. This is made possible with the existence of the NSC Act. None other than to protect the people. There are no other intentions or purposes. At its early stages, all NSOF strengths and assets will be assigned from the other security forces, with new application to be open in the future so as not to further affect existing force members. The first NSOF batch will be on duty for at least three years, while future intakes into the force will be assigned to a period of no less than two years. It has been reported that the NSOF may have been disbanded on July 2018,https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/special-operations/new-malaysian- government-disbands-nsof/ which will be replaced by a Special Forces Command in the Malaysian military.https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/special- operations/malaysia-centralizes-special-forces-command/  Introductions  The eight elements of Malaysia's Special Operations Force have been tasked with the important objective of maintaining Malaysia's security, specifically in combating terrorism. A mission especially important in the wake of the 11 September attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and in a climate of global terrorism which would see the later bombing of the tourist centre of Bali and the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, bombings and murders in Southern Thailand and the bomb explosions in the railway stations and transit systems of Madrid and London. Malaysia's security agencies eagerly studied the lessons to be learnt from all such incidents so as to prepare to deal with similar terrorism, in the event that the terrorists should see Malaysia as a target. In November 2003 Malaysia passed new counter-terrorism laws that were widely criticised by local human rights groups for being vague and excessively broad. Critics claim that the laws put the basic rights of free expression, association, and assembly at risk. Malaysia persisted in holding around 100 alleged militants without trial, including five Malaysian students detained for alleged terrorist activity while studying in Karachi, Pakistan.online Human Rights News 2004 Malaysia maintains a high level of security and to date no similar terrorist atrocities have occurred. Previously the only incidents with possible links to Islamic terrorism have been the detonation of a small bomb in Kuala Lumpur's Puduraya bus station and more significantly the 2000 Sauk raid by Al-Ma'unah militants, an audacious raid to steal weapons from a military base to arm an Islamic insurrection. This attempted insurrection was swiftly defeated, the result of the close co-operation and relationship of the government, private agencies and society as a whole. A co-operation and relationship born from the initiatives that from 1948 to 1989 defeated the communist insurgents during the Malayan Emergency and the later, the second insurgency.  Components =Military Grup Gerak Khas = The trooper of GGK with full equipment gear, armed with Colt M4A1 Carbine. The Grup Gerak Khas (GGK) () is the main entity element in the Malaysian Army. It is basically a commando regiment in the Malaysian Army Corps. The mission of the GGK is to provide a squadron to locate, report, harass and disrupt the enemy through long range infiltration as well as operating in close collaboration with guerrilla or partisan forces. GGK will also plan, prepare for, and when directed, deploy to conduct unconventional warfare, internal defence, special reconnaissance and direct actions etc. in support of Government policy objectives within designated areas of responsibility. GGK continuously trains to conduct unconventional warfare in any of its forms – guerrilla / anti-guerrilla warfare, escape and evasion, subversion, sabotage, counter-terrorist and their most highly regarded expertise – jungle warfare. They have a great reputation in operations against the communist terrorists. The troopers are also schooled in direct action operations and special reconnaissance. Currently, there are 3 fully equipped regiments (21st, 22nd & 11th GGK). GGK has seen action in Cambodia, Somalia, western Sahara, Namibia and Bosnia among others. Most recently GGK has also been involved with peacekeeping missions in Lebanon and Timor Leste.Operasi Astute = PASKAL = CQC drills.alt= The Royal Malaysian Navy also has elite forces to secure the Malaysian maritime areas, especially the Malacca Straits, from intruders and terrorist groups. The unit is known as Naval Special Warfare Forces () by its Malay acronym in the year 1980. The unit was established using commando-trained officers and men from the Security Regiment. The first batch were trained by Komando Pasukan Katak (KOPASKA), the naval special forces from Indonesia. First established in the year 1975, the role of this team is similar to coast guards whereby it was assigned to secure the RMN vessels, and the beaches. However, the UK Royal Marines Commando and US Navy SEALs have restructured the PASKAL forces. Some PASKAL operators have also been sent to the SEALs training center. PASKAL is now a highly competent special forces unit with responsibilities to secure all strategic areas and conducting other counter-terrorism operations in cargo shipments, oil rigs and the terrain. Some of its personnel are stationed in man-made 'islands' in the Spratlys and in strategic areas within the country's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). PASKAL is equipped with the latest hi-tech weaponry as they are also funded by an oil consortium (one of PASKAL's main missions is to protect oil rigs in Malaysian waters) and shipping companies. = PASKAU = PASKAU detachments with dressed in the No.4 Digital Camouflage, tactical gear and ghillie suits parading during the 60th National Day Parade of Malaysia at Sultan Abdul Samad Street, Kuala Lumpur. The Royal Malaysian Air Force once had a special operations force to secure the RMAF strategic airbase which was known as Special Air Service of Air Force (). In its first establishment, the name of this unit was known as HANDAU (Air and Land Defense, ) and at that moment, it did not have any counter-terrorism roles yet.In Bahasa Malaysia The tentative \\"special forces\\" designation was probably due to the unit's airborne capability. This unit was established after the covert attacks on the RMAF strategic amenities in Sungai Besi by agents of the Malayan Communist Party. With very high competency level, the unit was tasked to secure the RMAF airbases and amenities and also civil airports including Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) if necessary. Under Directive No. 18 National Defense Council () it is also tasked with handling hijackers or terrorism involving RMAF bases. The GGK army commando were also included to join this unit at its formation. Nowadays, PASKAU had the three branches including Flight Hostage Rescue Team (, tasked on Counter-Terrorist force), Combat Air Rescue Squadron (, CSAR task) and Force Protection Squadron (, Air Base protections task). The unit conducted special training technique and rescue missions, especially rescue operations for a downed pilot behind enemy lines or in hostile territory, but they were much more popular for life-saving services to civilians (courtesy flights etc.). Other than that, PASKAU may also search and eliminate enemy troops who execute sabotage against RMAF air bases. Law enforcement Pasukan Gerakan Khas = PGK operatives on standby. They are armed with MP5-Ns equipped with alt= In the days of communist insurgency, the Royal Malaysia Police had a light infantry arm called Pasukan Polis Hutan (PPH) (). They had several battalions and among them was the elite one, known as 69 Commando Battalion or VAT 69. It was actually formed in 1969 (hence the name – 69). The police general duty too had the special ops unit – Unit Tindakhas (UTK). UTK had a SWAT-like function as well as close protection roles. After the communist terrorists laid down arms in 1989, VAT 69 had problems finding a proper role. Finally on October 1997, the PPH was renamed as Pasukan Gerakan Am (PGA) () while UTK and 69 Commando were merged in a special operations command. It was then called Pasukan Gerakan Khas (PGK) ().A. Navaratnam, p. 192 All officers and personnels of VAT 69 and UTK's wherever conduct the special training from the United States (besides Germany GSG-9, Australia, Britain and New Zealand SAS) including special investigators, counter-terrorist experts, risk, special demolitions, airborne and much more. The PGK police counter-terrorists are ever involved in anti-terror operations in Malaysia, for example the armed rebellion of the Al Ma'unah terrorist militia led by Mohamed Amin Razali. The police special force, together with Grup Gerak Khas, successfully tracked down the rebellion, as well as being involved in the arrest of suspected Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist groups who were involved in the 9/11 attacks and Bali bombing. Beside that, the unit also took over the 10 Para and GGK duties in Timor Leste after the terrorism in the country was calmed down. = Special Task and Rescue = alt= The Special Task and Rescue () or STAR team is the official coast guard special forces of the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency which was established to protect local maritime assets, especially the Straits of Malacca. Initially, the commandos were formerly trained by Air Force PASKAU and formed on 25 April 2005. STARs are trained to be a first responder to potential terrorist situations; deny terrorist acts; perform security actions against non-compliant actors; perform tactical facility entry and enforcement; participate in port level counterterrorism exercises; and educate other forces on Coast Guard counterterrorism procedures. STARs are a quick response force capable of rapid nationwide deployment via air, ground or sea transportation in response to changing threat conditions. Multi-mission capability facilitates augmentation for other selected Coast Guard missions. The STAR's purpose is to develop systems and processes for standardised training, equipment, organisation, planning, and scheduling of rapidly deployable specialised forces to execute mission objectives in support of tactical and operational commanders.  Support units  10 Paratrooper Brigade = Paratroopers from 10 Para preparing to march for the 59th Merdeka Day parade 10 Paratrooper Brigade (10 PARA) is an elite rapid deployment brigade which is a branch of the Malaysian Army. It was then merged with other infantry elements including 3 battalions, 1 artillery regiment, 1 armour squadron and 11 supporting units. While primarily tasked with rapid deployment, it is also involved in the fight against terrorism but in a different manner. This is because the operational tasks for the 10th Para involves the convergence of conventional warfare tactics requiring a high number of personnel and equipment. This includes amphibian warfare and airborne operations, just to name a few. 10 Para is not considered as a special operations unit. The paratrooper force consists of male and some female paratroopers. = UNGERIN = The UNGERIN (Unit Gempur Marin) anti-terror operatives on patrol with MP5A3 The Marine Combat Unit or UNGERIN (Unit Gempur Marin) is a newly formed maritime anti-terror special force which was established in March 2006 and was under control of the Marine Operations Force of RMP. Very different from other Malaysian special forces, the UNGERIN is the only one special force in Malaysia which is trained by the United States (all special forces of Malaysia are regularly trained with foreign special forces including the Special Air Service Regiments of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom and a number of US services). The unit which has been given special training by 69 Commando and US Navy SEALs were tasked with securing the Malaysia maritime, especially the Malacca Straits and Sulu Sea from threats at sea, especially piracy and smugglers, and cooperation with naval elite units and coast guard. = Rapid Actions Troops = The Rapid Actions Troops, or Trup Tindakan Cepat, is a new Prison Department anti-terror special forces squad, which was established on 3 October 2005 and operates under control of the Malaysian Prison Department. Formed with 20 members that had undergone three months training at the Special Warfare Training Centre (PULPAK) in Sungai Udang Fort, Malacca by 11th Rejimen Gerak Khas Counter-Terrorist Regiment for dealing with terrorist threats and riot which occurred inside the jails in Malaysia. With the formation of this team, the Prisons Department was able to carry out escort tasks without police assistance, escorting prisoners that are listed as high-profile criminal records to detention centres. When needed, the team is also used to assist the other Malaysian special forces in counter-terrorism missions.

Four individuals so far have been given this designation: Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Xi Jinping. The designation is not a formal title and does not hold legal weight, but its use in official party documentation gives its holder a precisely defined place in party theory on their relative standing to the rest of the Communist Party leadership. The leadership core operates as part of the Leninist-inspired framework of democratic centralism, and is intended to represent a vital center rather than a hierarchical peak, which differentiates it from the role of paramount leader. Although all core leaders have also been paramount leaders, not all paramount leaders were the leadership core. History From the pivotal Zunyi Conference forward, Mao Zedong was the undisputed leader of the Chinese Communist Party, though he did not formally become party chairman until 1943. However, much of Mao's authority was informal, earned after years of building clout through the civil war and intra-party struggles. After Mao died in 1976, his successor as party chairman, Hua Guofeng, was unable to build a strong coalition of support in spite of having a wide range of official titles. Deng Xiaoping emerged as the pre-eminent leader of China in 1978, and was indisputably the highest authority in the country throughout the 1980s even though he held only one formal government post, that of chairman of the Central Military Commission. Following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Zhao Ziyang, the party's General Secretary and widely recognized as Deng's successor at the time, was sidelined due to his sympathy to student protesters. In his place, party elders brought in then Shanghai party secretary Jiang Zemin to take over the position of General Secretary. However, Jiang, who had spent much of his career in Shanghai, was a compromise candidate who had no prior experience in the party's central organization. Consolidating his power and raising his stature in the party required the backing of Deng and other party elders, but also a recognition from other members of the party leadership that Jiang was now the dominant leadership figure. To strengthen Jiang's position in spite of his relatively thin political resume, Deng advanced the idea of the \\"leadership core\\", referencing Mao as the core of the party during the revolution in the early years of the People's Republic, and declaring himself the core of the party since the beginning of economic reforms. The term \\"core\\", which invoked a concentric, non-hierarchical image, was a clever political innovation that avoided designating any individual as \\"supreme\\" and \\"above the rest\\". It implicitly recognized the political ills of the personality cult during the Mao era while also allowing for the embodiment of unity around a single leadership figure. In June 1989, shortly following the military's advance on Beijing to quell the protests, Deng said to other party leaders, \\"every leadership collective must have a core; a leading collective without a core is unreliable.\\" Ostensibly, Deng was making a reference to the diffusion of power in the 1980s having led to the undesirable result of an open schism between party leaders at a time of crisis. In response, Deng declared, Jiang Zemin would become the core of the \\"third generation\\" of Communist Party leaders. Jiang was referred to as a \\"core\\" in official documentation for the first time on November 9, 1989, at the closing of the Fifth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee, which called for the party to \\"closely rally around the party center with Jiang Zemin as its core.\\" The phrase was then oft-repeated as a familiar slogan in official party documentation thereafter, until the succession of Hu Jintao as party leader in 2002. Upon Hu's taking on the titles of the party and the state, Jiang refused to relinquish the chairmanship of the Central Military Commission until 2005, in a move that paralleled Deng holding the title in the 1980s, when the party was nominally run by other people. However, Jiang lacked Deng's clout, and was criticized by some members of the party for overstaying his term and meddling in the affairs of his successor. Jiang had stacked the Politburo Standing Committee, which made decisions based on consensus, with his own allies, constraining Hu's authority. Hu was therefore largely seen as a \\"first-among-equals\\" figure with his Standing Committee colleagues. Not only could he not rule by fiat, but that he never earned recognition as \\"core\\" was also a signal that he possibly even lacked the power of arbitration that was normally accorded to a \\"core\\" figure. In this leadership collective, Hu was never referred to explicitly as the new \\"core\\" of the party. Instead, the party used the phrase, \\"united around the party center with Comrade Hu Jintao as General Secretary.\\" Xi Jinping succeeded Hu as General Secretary in 2012. He embarked on a series of bold programs to eliminate corruption and reform the economy. By 2016, his pre-eminent status became widely understood and many provincial party chiefs began declaring fealty to him and again invoking the term \\"leadership core\\". Xi's official status as the \\"core\\" was announced at a gathering of the Central Committee later that year.

Biography=Early life Vinícius Gageiro Marques was born on September 1, 1989 in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, to Ana Maria Gageiro, a psychoanalyst and college professor, and Luiz Marques, also a college professor, and former Rio Grande do Sul Secretary of Culture. Marques' family moved to France when he was three, where he started learning French, but they moved back to Brazil when he was seven. He rapidly developed his English language skills through watching television, reading on the internet and listening to music. Sometime after, he taught himself to speak Welsh and to read Spanish. At age nine, Marques started therapy due to what his father called a \\"chemical imbalance\\". Marques's musical interest was evident from an early age. At age 4, he experimented playing the drums for the first time, and soon after took up the piano and guitar. Teenage years During his teenage years, Marques was depressed and felt out of place at school and at home; he had a frequent presence on the Internet. At age 13, he started capturing his daily life via a camera. On July 26, 2004, he signed up for gaming forum RLLMUK, where he would eventually become a regular. He also made a blog via Blogspot, and over the course of his teenage years, he collaborated with others in music, photographic projects, and drawings, including a collaboration with Sabrepulse He expressed admiration for such musicians as MPB singer-songwriters Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, and was shown to have been influenced by Toquinho and Antônio Carlos Jobim. Other influences included Leonard Cohen, John Frusciante, Neutral Milk Hotel, Grandaddy, and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci. He was an avid reader of Franz Kafka. Marques was first shown to be suicidal in May 2006, when he posted on RLLMUK stating \\"Quick, someone say something really nice about my songs before I decide to KILL MYSELF.\\" However, after the supportive response this post received, he decided to postpone his suicide; he frequently mentioned killing himself online and whilst sharing his songs with others up until his death. At around this time, his mother found the lyrics to his song \\"Suicide\\" on his bed, and confronted him about it; she eventually found evidence of his suicidal ideation online and got him into therapy again. In therapy, Marques seemed to be improving. Death On the afternoon on July 26, 2006, Marques told his parents that he would be having friends over for a barbecue, and had them leave the apartment for the day since he wanted to impress a girl. However, he had made plans to commit suicide through smoke inhalation by locking himself in his bathroom with two barbecue grills, and had posted on a forum asking for help killing himself. While some people in the thread pleaded him to stop, others gave him the advice he wanted; after Marques reported he couldn't stand the heat inside the bathroom, a retired firefighter told him to lay face down with a damp towel over himself to make it more comfortable. His last post was at 3:02 pm GMT-3. A Canadian online friend of Marques's learned of the suicide attempt and called the Porto Alegre police, giving them Marques' address. Although the police and paramedics were able to enter the apartment and clear the smoke, Marques was pronounced dead by suicide via carbon monoxide poisoning at approximately 3:30 pm, after multiple attempts at resuscitation. Marques left a CD-R with some of his music and a suicide note addressed to his parents, which cleared them from any responsibility over his death, and thanked them for their support. Legacy After Marques' death, his father looked through his computer and found more of his recorded music. In 2008, the album Yoñlu was released in Brazil on the Allegro label. However, in 2009, Luaka Bop internationally released A Society in Which No Tear Is Shed Is Inconceivably Mediocre after former Talking Heads frontman David Byrne, the label's founder, took an interest in Yoñlu's story. The album was well-received by critics, although few reviewed it. A film based on Marques' life, titled Yonlu, was released in 2017. It was directed by Brazilian director Hique Motanari and starred Thalles Cabral in the title role. The film was released in 2018.

Named for the town of Gananoque, Ontario situated on the Saint Lawrence River, the minesweeper entered service in 1941 and participated in the Battle of the Atlantic and the Battle of the Saint Lawrence, mainly as a convoy escort. Following the end of the war in 1945 Gananoque was decommissioned and placed in reserve. The vessel was reacquired in 1952, but never reentered service and was sold for scrap in 1959 and broken up. Design and description A British design, the Bangor-class minesweepers were smaller than the preceding s in British service, but larger than the in Canadian service.Chesneau, p. 64Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 167 They came in two versions powered by different engines; those with a diesel engines and those with vertical triple-expansion steam engines. Gananoque was of the latter design and was larger than her diesel-engined cousins. Gananoque was long overall, had a beam of and a draught of .Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 180 The minesweeper had a displacement of . She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted. Gananoque had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. The minesweeper was armed with a single quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt gun mounted forward. The ships were also fitted with a QF 2-pounder Mark VIII aft and were eventually fitted with single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns on the bridge wings.Macpherson (1997), p. 46 Those ships assigned to convoy duty were armed with two depth charge launchers and four chutes to deploy their 40 depth charges. Gananoque was equipped with LL and SA minesweeping gear to counter magnetic and acoustic naval mines. Operational history Ordered as part of the 1940–41 building programme, the minesweeper's keel was laid down on 15 January 1941 by Dufferin Shipbuilding Co. at their yard in Toronto, Ontario. Gananoque was launched on 23 April 1941 and commissioned at Toronto on 8 November 1941.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 181 The minesweeper sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Gananoque was assigned to Halifax Force, the local patrol and convoy escort force. The ship then transferred to St. John's Local Defence Force based at St. John's, Newfoundland. During the Battle of the Saint Lawrence, Gananoque was assigned to the Gulf Escort Force, tasked with escorting convoys through the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the St. Lawrence River. With sister ship and two Fairmile B motor launches, Gananoque was escorting the Sydney-Quebec convoy SQ 43 comprising three merchant vessels in October 1942 when they made contact with west of Cap-Chat on the Gaspé Peninsula. Gananoque dropped depth charges on the submarine, doing some damage to the U-boat and forcing the submarine to break off its attack on the convoy.Douglas et al., No Higher Purpose, p. 464 The minesweeper transferred to Sydney Force, the local patrol and escort force operating out of Sydney, Nova Scotia. In January 1943 Gananoque was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force as part of group 24.18.6 which also included the destroyer and the corvettes and as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic.Rohwer, p. 222 In May, Gananoque underwent a refit at Quebec City, Quebec. In July, the minesweeper rejoined Halifax Force, transferring to Sydney Force in May 1944. In July 1944, the ship underwent a second refit, this time at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, taking eight weeks to complete. In February 1945, the minesweeper joined Newfoundland Force based at St. John's and remained with the group until it was disbanded in June. Gananoque joined Atlantic Coast Command until being paid off at Sydney on 13 October 1945. The vessel was taken to Shelburne, Nova Scotia and placed in reserve. The minesweeper lay in reserve until reacquired during the Korean War in 1952 and given the new hull number 181. However, the ship was not recommissioned and Gananoque was sold for scrap to Marine Industries in February 1959 and broken up.Colledge, p. 254 References=NotesCitationsSources   External links * * Category:Bangor-class minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Ships built in Ontario Category:Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:1941 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of Canada ","title":"HMCS Gananoque"},{"id":"52132287","title":"Kerala Police"},{"id":"52132302","text":"Maurizio Solaro di Moretta (1607 – 25 December 1655) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Mondovi (1642–1655).

Sid Hemphill (1876 - 1963) was an American blues multi- instrumentalist and bandleader who played in his own string band mainly in Mississippi. He recorded for Alan Lomax in 1942 and again in 1959. Born in Panola County, Mississippi, Hemphill was the son of a slave fiddle player, crafted instruments, and was a blind musician. Trained as a multi- instrumentalist, he could effectively play fiddle, banjo, guitar, jaw harp, piano, organ, quills, and the cane fife, while also penning songs. Hemphill and his string band, composed of Alex \\"Turpentine\\" Askew (guitar), Lucious Smith (banjo), and Will Head (fiddle), played a combination of blues, popular music, and spirituals for both black and white audiences mainly in Northern Mississippi. The same group also identified as a fife and drums band, with music infused in European military drum tradition and African polyrhythms, talking drum influences. According to blues writer Edward Komara, Hemphil's quill playing was highly syncopated and offered the closest connection to traditional African music. Field collector and ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax traveled to Senatobia to seek out Hemphill after a local string bandleader described him as the \\"boar-hog musician of the hills”, also proclaiming him as \\"the best musician in the world\\". On August 15, 1942, Lomax recorded 22 songs and an interview with Hemphill and his group. Although the group identified as a string band, for the recordings they played fife and drums Lomax recorded a second session with Hemphill when he revisited him in 1959. Music critic Amanda Petrusich noted in a review for Pitchfork that \\"Hemphill's work incorporates attributes of the Mississippi Hill Country’s better-known traditions (the droning guitar blues mastered by McDowell, R.L. Burnside, and Junior Kimbrough, and the fife-and-drum music practiced by Otha Turner, Napolian Strickland, and Hemphill himself)\\", which differs from the neighboring Delta blues. His best-known song \\"The Eighth of January\\" became the basis for Johnny Horton's hit \\"The Battle of New Orleans\\". Hemphil died in 1963, having never commercially record any of his songs for release in his lifetime. Nonetheless, his two field sessions with Lomax were made more accessible by the release of the compilation album The Devil's Dream in 2013. Other members of the Hemphill family also became musicians, including his daughter Rosa Lee Hill, and his paternal granddaughter, Jessie Mae Hemphill, a pioneering guitarist. Hemphill was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Senatobia.

However, there are some exceptions: for instance, the Cretan Hound has usually rose-ears and a curly or curved tail, while the Barrocal Algarvio is long-haired, and the Podenco Paternero and some Campaneros have a robust, almost Mastiff-like body.

It is a sequel to Wasteland 2 (2014) and was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on August 28, 2020. Initially planned Linux and macOS versions were postponed to the end of 2020. Gameplay Wasteland 3 is a squad-based role-playing video game featuring turn-based combat. Played from an isometric perspective, the game features synchronous and asynchronous multiplayer. In the game, players need to make various choices, which would have different impacts on the game's world and the story. The game introduces a vehicle that the players can use to traverse the world and store supplies. The main campaign can be played cooperatively with another player. Plot Wasteland 3 is set in the freezing wastelands of a post-apocalyptic Colorado. The player takes control of two members from Arizona Ranger Team November, who survived after an attack when arriving in Colorado. Their mission is to liaise and help the local ruler, known as \\"The Patriarch\\", in order to earn his support for the Rangers in the issues in Arizona. Once arrived and settled, the rangers discover the Patriarch wants to rein in his 3 heirs who have gone wild, as well as pursue his strong and brutal rule over Colorado. As the story unfolds, Rangers discover the extent of the Patriach's brutality, and are contacted by NPC Angela Deth (reference from previous Wasteland games) in a push to overthrow the Patriarch. Player must then decide of the final course of action to take. Development Wasteland 3 was announced by inXile Entertainment in September 2016.

As with Wasteland 2, inXile chose to crowdfund the development of the game. Unlike their previous Kickstarter projects, inXile chose to use equity crowdfunding service Fig. The crowdfunding campaign launched in October 2016, and concluded a month later with over $3 million raised.

After Xbox Game Studios acquired the company, inXile hired more staff for the game's development and delayed its release date to early 2020. The game's budget was three times more than Wasteland 2. The additional budget was mostly spent on implementing conversational scenes and hiring voice actors. It was delayed again due to inXile's remote working conditions from the COVID-19 pandemic., while the Mac and Linux versions have been postponed to an undisclosed date due to developer's \\"decision to focus Wasteland 3’s initial release on Windows 10, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4\\" Further expansion of the story is planned through downloadable content in the future.

Evdochia was most probably the mother of Stephen's two sons, Bogdan and Peter, according to historian Jonathan Eagles. Bogdan died in 1479, Peter in 1480. Both sons were buried in the Putna Monastery, established by their father. When Stephen made a donation to the Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos on 27 July 1466, specified that the monks should pray for his relatives, including Evdochia and their two children, Alexandru and Olena. Alexandru was most probably identical with Stephen's first-born son and co-ruler who died in 1496, according to Eagles. She died in the winter of 1467. She was buried in the Mirăuți Church (which was the see of the Metropolitan of Moldavia) in Suceava. Her husband granted 100 beehives, a vineyard and a pond to the church on 15 February 1469.

This château was built between 1566 and 1573 and has several unique design features. For example, it has a novel pentagonal-shaped house and is buttressed by five towers, and has a centrally located well surrounded by a spiral staircase. During the 20th century, the château was in an advanced state of disrepair. In 1942, the château was classified as a historic monument and in 1997 it was purchased by the Conseil General of Yonne. It has since been the focus of historical and archaeological research and restoration. In 2005, the château was made open to the public.  History = The \\"motte of Maulnes\\"  The site on which the château stands is believed to have been occupied since the Neolithic era. The earliest reference to the area is found in a book written in the year 863 called \\"Molnitum\\". A fortified structure, known as the \\"motte of Maulnes\\", was built in a clearing within the forest Maulnes, by the counts of Tonnerre in the 13th century. The time-frame has been confirmed by references made in historical writings as well as research using aerial photography. This structure is thought to have facilitated the counts in hunting activities, such as in the company of distinguished guests including the Duke of Burgundy Philip the Bold, who came to hunt in 1366 and 1374. In 1411, a quarrel broke out between the Count of Tonnerre (Louis II of Chalon-Arlay) and the Duke of Burgundy (John the Fearless). As a consequence, the Burgundian troops invaded the county and destroyed this structure, as well as others.  The project  Louise de Clermont by François Clouet Androuet du Cerceau Antoine de Crussol by François Clouet A century and a half later, after the death of her first husband, the countess of Tonnerre, Louise de Clermont, married Antoine de Crussol, Duke of Uzes, Both were influential and well known figures, close to the court of France as well as the Queen herself, Catherine de Medici. In 1566, the couple decided to build a château in the forest Maulnes where the \\"motte of Maulnes\\" once stood. By this time, the sixty-two year old Louise had considerable exposure to and appreciation for architecture. For example, her brother, Antoine III of Clermont, entrusted the architect Sebastiano Serlio to building him a château in Ancy-le-Franc, near Maulnes, about 25 years earlier. With the signing of the Edict of Amboise in 1563, France enjoyed a brief period of peace from internal religious wars, allowing for a large-scale project, such as building the Château de Maulnes, to come to fruition. Antoine de Crussol, who became Duke of Uzes in May 1565, no longer had a residence worthy of his rank in the county. The château would stand as a symbol of his newly acquired power, if not by its size, then by its beauty and architectural originality. The location of the château in the forest was likely chosen due to nearby hunting opportunities as well as the economic incentive for extracting timber from the vast forests of the region. At the time, the sale of firewood to Paris was the most important resource of the region.  The construction (1566 - 1573)  On May 7, 1566, Antoine de Crussol signed a notarized contract to hire a master mason and a master carpenter and provided them with detailed plans of the Château de Maulnes. While there is much speculation regarding the possible architect for the project, the designer is not known. In February 1568, following a period of religious unrest, the Prince of Conde's army occupied the suburbs of Tonnerre and besieged the city, relenting with the payment of a ransom. In November, the Catholic troops seized Noyers (Yonne), and about a year later the army of Marshal de Cosse arrived and restored the peace in Tonnerre. Louise de Clermont in later years, artist unknown Despite these setbacks, progress on the construction continued. In September 1569, Louise de Clermont moved to Maulnes, and furnished the château. In January 1570, Antoine de Crussol joined her in the completed château. The second project, constructing the adjoining buildings, may have started in August 1570, after the departure of Crussol who joined the French court in later life. In 1572, Antoine de Crussol was made peerage of France, for his Duchy of Uzes. During this time, tensions in the country were particularly high between Catholics and Protestants. On August 24, 1572 Anthoine's brother Galiot became one of the victims of the massacre of St. Bartholomew. From January to July 1573, Antoine de Crussol participated in the siege of La Rochelle. He returned to Château de Maulnes exhausted and ill and died August 14, 1573.  The Clermont-Tonnerre period (1573 - 1697)  Once again a widow, Louise de Clermont spent her remaining years between Paris, Tonnerre, Ancy-le-Franc and Maulnes. After May 1575, she did not return to Maulnes and entrusted the building to two men. In 1576, the Château de Maulnes, was listed in a publication as one of the top 30 exceptional buildings in France.Jacques Androuet Hoop published the first volume of the \\"Plus Excellents Bastiments de France\\" In the following years, Louise faced legal trials filed against her as well as the estates of her deceased husbands. At 92 years old, she died in May 1596 in the Hotel-Dieu de Tonnerre. Louise de Clermont died childless and with unresolved legal problems. In March 1606, her great-nephew and heir Charles-Henri de Clermont reached an agreement with the creditors. After a paying out a settlement, he became Count of Tonnerre, Cruzy and Maulnes. In 1610 Charles-Henri made enhancements to the ceiling in the great hall. Charles-Henri also divided the regions of Maulnes and Cruzy, and made his youngest son marquess and his oldest son the count of Clermont and Tonnerre. Despite these preparations for his sons, after his death in 1640, his eldest son François de Clermont claimed that some of the possessions of his brother Roger, to have always belonged to Tonnerre County. That same year, his representative took possession of the château de Maulnes. It is not known if it was inhabited by either brother, however an engraving of Israel Silvestre in 1650 suggests that it was in a state of neglect. With respect to the ownership of the château, in 1658 a judgment of parliament sided with the younger brother Roger, Marquess of Cruzy. A fortified structure, known as the \\"motte of Maulnes\\", was built in a clearing within the forest Maulnes, by the counts of Tonnerre in the 13th century. The time-frame has been confirmed by references made in historical writings as well as research using aerial photography. This structure is thought to have facilitated the counts in hunting activities, such as in the company of distinguished guests including the Duke of Burgundy Philip the Bold, who came to hunt in 1366 and 1374. Between 1650 and 1670, In 1647 Roger returned from the armies of Flanders and between 1650 and 1670 he made modifications and repairs to château de Maulnes.  The Louvois period (1697 - 1844)  François Michel Le Tellier, artist unknwn Maulnes (near image center) on an 18th-century Cassini map Between 1683 and 1685, François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois bought Tonnerre county from François-Joseph Clermont, the grandson of Francis and the grand-nephew of Roger. Louvois was well known for his role as the French Secretary of State for War. Louvois died in 1691 and his widow, Anne de Souvré maintained possession of Tonnerre county. In June 1697, Anne bought Maulnes and Cruzy from Roger's son, who was experiencing financial difficulties, and thus taking possession of the château de Maulnes and reuniting Charles-Henri's divided estate. Anne de Souvré drew a detailed map of the forest Maulnes and died in December 1715. The estate is settled six years later, and Maulnes was again abandoned. In 1721, the eldest son of Louvois, Michel-François Le Tellier marquis Courtanvaux, inherited Tonnerre County, but he died soon thereafter. His daughter, Anne-Louise de Noailles, received temporary guardianship until his two-year-old son, Francis Tellier Caesar Courtanvaux, became an adult. In 1723, the royal council of finance authorized timber to float from Maulnes to Paris by the Armançon, Yonne and the Seine rivers. As a consequence, a small community of workers formed around the château. As an adult, Francis continued the timber operations. In 1775, the timber merchants near the château received permission from the Marquis to start a glassworks industry, which was more profitable than selling timber. This industry transformation significantly changed the landscape of Maulnes with the gradual clearing of the forest and the growth of the community. In 1781, the Marquis died with no direct heir. His cousin Louis-Sophie Le Tellier Souvré, son of François-Louis Le Tellier, became Count of Tonnerre. He died in debt four years later and his widow Jeanne Marie Henriette Bombelles Victory supervised the estate on behalf of her two-year-old son. Both survived the French Revolution and the abolition of French feudalism and regained the property and she managed it until her death in 1822. In 1806, a note drafted by the subprefect of Tonnerre described the processes and in the production of Maulnes glassware, specifically mentioning production of 300,000 bottles per year. This production could only occur 6 months out of the year due to timber limitations of the forest of Maulnes. When he took over the management of glassware in 1819, Louis Le Tellier Souvré became a peer of France under the Restoration. In 1804, his son, Auguste Felicite Michel Le Tellier, married Athénaïs Grimaldi of Monaco, daughter of Joseph Grimaldi and niece of the Prince of Monaco Grimaldi Honoré IV. In 1819, production doubled and the local glassware industry was employing a hundred workers, in addition to the loggers and valets. In 1824 the Maulnes estate was rented to a master came glassmaker from Bayel, François Vallory. In 1834, the financially ruined Marquis de Louvois sold Maulnes, including the château, to the glassmaker. In 1844, François closed the estate, facing his own financial difficulties. Château de Maulnes in the 20th century  Period of abandonment (1844 - 1997)  The château and the surrounding land was sold in 1851 to Gabriel Knight, a banker from Châtillon-sur-Seine, who abandoned the château. After his death in 1866, succession documents describe the buildings \\"in poor condition\\". In the 1880s, some repairs were undertaken. After the bankruptcy of Adrian Knight, the Maulnes estate is purchased by the Prunier family in 1898. It then passed into the hands of the industrialist Ferdinand Serres and his son, who own it from 1918 to 1960. It is believed these successive owners were more interested in the land and woods surrounding the château, since the château itself was not maintained and gradually falls into serious disrepair during this period.. On 11 July 1942, le château de Maulnes was classified by France's Service des Monuments Historiques, who unsuccessfully attempted repairs in 1943 and 1944. In 1960, the deed of sale indicates \\"a château and outbuildings, all in ruins\\". The château, without the land was purchased by the Friends of Maulnes Company and for the first time, a large backup funded plan was implemented. In 1964, a work permit was granted to repair the crumbling façades. Fundraising continued until 1969. But the company suddenly ended the campaign and deterioration worsened with the storms in 1979 and 1981-1982. In 1985, a decree compelled the owner to perform the restoration work; they are led to office in 1987. Finally in 1997, the General Council of the Yonne acquired Maulnes after an expropriation procedure. The château de Maulnes in the midst of restoration work in 2014  The period of rediscovery (1997 -)  In 1997 a scientific committee is set up to organize multidisciplinary research required to understand Maulnes. While historians studying the archives relating to the château and its sponsors, archaeologists of the Centre for Medieval Studies at Auxerre performed excavations and research, both in the château and its surroundings. For four years, the research focused on various themes such as the relationship between the château and the Maulnes forest and the hydrogeological study of the site. This initial research identified for the first time the most pressing issues needing to be addressed in the prevention of further deterioration and restoration of the château. While the initial work has saved Maulnes and created a tourist attraction, it will take many more years before the château and grounds are fully restored to their original, 16th-century condition.  Description  Jacques Androuet du Cerceau  The site  Maulnes is 25 km from Tonnerre, the main city of the region, and 15 km of the châteaus of Tanlay and Ancy-le-Franc. It lies on the edge of a large plateau of farmland that was once covered with forests. The 18th-century Cassini map shows the château surrounded by a vast forest, in a clearing at the intersection of five forest paths. These paths allowed for ease of logging and hunting, and also created a spectacular view of the château. The château has three predictable streams of water, providing water to the premises. The château is a complex of three buildings. The entrance was a semicircular common, only a portion of which still remains. Contiguous with the common was a covered porch which has completely disappeared over the years. Lastly was an open air fixed bridge leading from the covered porch to the pentagonal house. The semi-circular commons, as seen from the château.  The commons and the gallery  The commons was a semicircular building surrounding the courtyard, with one floor and an attic. The original Philibert Delorme structure was built around 1570-1572, but was replaced between 1662 and 1674 by a traditional frame. It had likely had undergone additional changes since then to adapt for industrial use at the time of the glassworks industry. A 1942 map shows the commons completely intact. Today, half of the structure is missing. The structure was dismantled in 2000-2001 for restoration work, but has since been restored and now serve as public reception venue and exhibition hall. The extant entrance hallway was built in the center of the gallery and was centerpiece of the commons. The plans of Du Cerceau shows a floored gallery with five arches leading to an open-air fixed bridge supported by four columns and a moveable gateway. From the bridge over the moat was then the north tower of the pentagonal house.  The pentagonal house  The pentagonal house of the chateau, in the midst of restoration work in 2014 The pentagonal house was built with five equal sides of about 17 m surrounding a hollow cylinder shaped well. Adjacent to the central space is a large spiral staircase which connects all five levels and the terrace at the top. Each pentagonal corner has a tower. Three of the towers have a staircase, probably intended for servants, allowing the central staircase to be reserved for the owners and their guests. Four towers are incorporated into the pentagonal form; while the fifth, the north tower, was added after the finished building, perhaps for reasons of safety from renewed war. The building has an axis of symmetry that passes through the north tower and through the middle of the south facade. Throughout the home, there are 21 fireplaces, which was not unusual given the harsh winters on the Maulnes plateau. On the roof, the five chimneys act to support the central terrace. The well, forming an axis within the central staircase = The well = The walls of the well contains several large windows arranged regularly. It was possible to draw water from the well to every floor, and there is evidence of wear due to the ropes in several locations, but especially on the third floor. The interior of the nymphaeum after restoration work. = First and second floors = Due to the natural slope of the terrain, the first floor on the north side is buried while on the south side it is exposed. A diverted water source feeds the bowl, which in turn connects to the base of the interior well. The overflow of the bowl, as well as two other water sources, flowed into a basin or nymphaeum, partly inside and partly outside. These two floors included areas that could serve as storage areas, basements and cellars. = Third floor = The main entrance and vestibule of the pentagonal house is on the north side of the third floor. Research on this level has discovered evidence of a bathing room containing an oven, a boiler room and hypocaust (heated floor). These areas were accessible by a staircase from one of the main bedrooms of the upper floor. In the bathroom are remnants of a mural painted with an oil paint on mortar. The surviving traces show a forest backdrop and several female figures, possibly a representation of the legend of Diana. A Doric column = Fourth floor = This level was the main floor of activity, recognizable by the greater ceiling heights and two Doric columns that adorn it. From the description of Androuet du Cerceau, ceilings of this floor were quite remarkable, especially the enrayure-style box struts that are aligned diagonally with the room walls. A small room, identified as a washroom, is connected to the main bedroom. A water discharge, through the window sill, suggests a bathtub was once present. = The terrace = At the top of the château is a terrace surrounded by five chimney stacks, forming belvedere with a room for a roof lantern in the center. This lantern would have provided shelter from rain and would allow natural light to enter the central well below. It was later covered by a pyramidal roof, but this removed in the twentieth century. Cornice corbels of the north tower = The facades = The main building was designed to be viewed primarily from a north-south angle. The five facades differ from each other, however, they all share three elements: an ashlar roof base, floors and an attic. The two north facades, situated on either side of the entry turret, combine and form an assembly; while the south facade and two towers that flank form another. The south facade opens to the garden and features a nymphaeum in the lower part. The ashlar roof base was made up of a cornice with supporting corbels, the design of which were of alternating dog heads and lion heads, reflecting a hunting theme. Photographs from 1942, show that three dogs' heads were still in place at that time. This decoration has subsequently been reconstructed on the northeast and northwest facades. With the exception of heads, the facades appear very simple, which was uncommon at the time. However, their layout is well organized and more complex than it first appears. For example, there was a gradation of materials used; rustic stone for nymphée, smooth cut stones for the roof base, plaster cornices and protruding, stepped cornices floors. = Stone selection = The small rubble, used for interior wall siding, came from astartes limestone deposits located a few hundred meters from the château. The majority of stones belong to the same geological layer of soft, chalky white limestone of Tonnerre. It was used indoors as well as for the frame of the well. Another similar facies, though less chalky and more hard, was used for the exterior walls. A reddish stone was used in the masonry of the château, especially near the nymphaeum. It may have come from Indian bead limestone quarries located in the nearby communes of Massangis and Coutarnoux, near Avallon. Remnants of a garden as seen from the upper floors of the pentagonal house.  The exterior  The exterior of the nymphaeum prior to restorative work. = The garden = From the first construction, the whole future garden area was cleared and pickled. Then the walls closing and walls dry moat were built. Closing the walls, including the most distant part of the château is in a semicircle, surrounded by a hedge and a grass glaze. The original plan seems to have planned the construction of a large outer wall with bastions, which was not realized. On the mode of \\"palazzo in fortezza\\" Italian (a palace in a fortress), it was probably to protect themselves from common disorders in these times of civil war. = The nymphaeum = By reflecting the image of the château, the nymphaeum acts as a unifying element between the gardens and château. The vault of the basin is made of segments of alternating color. The exterior as well as the lintels of Level 1, is rusticated. In original plans of Du Cerceau, it is shown surrounded by bleachers forming a small theater. Yet the archaeological excavations suggest this was never present and the original plan for the nymphaeum was simplified. The current theories suggest a terrace wall separated the enclosed basin from the rest of the garden, interrupted by an access staircase. The plan of Du Cerceau could have corresponded to a project of later development that never came to fruition due to the abandonment of the site or the death of Antoine de Crussol. The nymphaeum was completely restored in 2012.

Biography  She was born to an old merchant family from Mannheim that was originally Jewish and had been converted. Her father, a court attorney, was a Catholic, but she was raised in her mother's evangelical Protestant faith. In 1835, she began her studies at the Malschule for women (part of the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf) with Julius Hübner and Karl Ferdinand Sohn.Brief biography from the Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon, reproduced @ Leon Wilnitsky Alte Kunst. After further studies in Mannheim and Karlsruhe, she went to Italy in 1851; first visiting Florence, then Rome. Pomona\\" There, she befriended Joseph Victor von Scheffel and served as the model for a minor character in his first work, a novel in verse, Der Trompeter von Säckingen, which was very popular; becoming the basis for an opera by Viktor Nessler and, in 1907, a silent movie by Franz Porten. She was also the inspiration for a scene from his short novel Ekkehard. She also came into contact with the Nazarenes; notably Peter von Cornelius and Friedrich Overbeck, who greatly influenced her work. She soon began producing paintings with religious themes and made plans to establish an artistic community for women, similar to the one established by the Nazarenes at the Sant’Isidoro a Capo le Case monastery. In 1857, she returned to Germany, possibly with Scheffel. Three years later, she converted to Catholicism at Lichtenthal Abbey. This capped a period when she had studied religious books and Biblical themes to paint an altar at the parish church of Saints Peter and Paul in Lahr. She then came into contact with the church painters Peter Lenz (later known as Father Desiderius Lenz) and Jakob Wüger (later known as Father Gabriel Wüger), who were in the process of developing their own variation on the Nazarene style that would come to be known as the Beuron Art School. In 1864, she began a major project; an \\"art monastery\\" that was originally intended for Rome but, because of her friendship with Katharina von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, her works were placed in the Beuron Archabbey. Still devoted to her idea of a monastic community for artists, she moved to Reichenau Island and acquired the \\"Schlößle\\", a manor house she meant to become a female branch of the Archabbey. A fresco (now lost) was painted on the façade by Wüger, but very little else was accomplished and the dream was never realized. She remained at Reichenau, near Mitelzell Abbey, painting religious works, and died there at the age of eighty. Her grave was adorned with a figure of Saint Pirmin, who had served as Abbot there.
