Built by postmaster George Long in the 1880s or 1890s, it is a rare statewide example of a privately owned post office building, built without reference to United States Postal Service standards. Now owned by a local non-profit, it is still the community's post office. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The post office is a 1-1/2 story wood frame building, located on the south side of Curtis Cove Road and facing north. The main facade is two bays wide, with a window to the left and the entrance to the right. A second, smaller window is in the gable end of the building's steeply pitched roof. The building has hints of Italianate styling in the bracketed hood sheltering the entrance, and in the carved rafter tails exposed in the gable end. There are two windows on the west side, none on the east, and two on the south side, along with an outside staircase which leads to the attic. The property also includes a second building that serves as a wood shed. East Blue Hill is first recorded as having a post office in 1873. The present building is generally accepted as having been built by George Long, who became postmaster in 1891, although local lore also places its construction date (by Long) at 1884. The building belonged to members of the Long family, who also served as postmasters, until 1997, when it was sold to the East Blue Hill Village Improvement Association. It continues to serve as the community's post office. The post office is distinct in the state as the only known example of a purpose-built post office facility that is not owned by the United States Postal Service, and that was not built or adapted to its standards. Of all of the post office buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine, only one other (the Old Post Office in Liberty) is not an architect-designed purpose-built facility, but was a residence adapted for Postal Service use.

The first UCL Librarian, Revd Dr Francis Augustus Cox, was appointed in 1827. The first purpose-built General Library opened in 1849 and was later renamed after the Professor of Architecture who designed it, Thomas Leverton Donaldson.

The community of Milliken Mills in Markham, Ontario is named after him.  Biography  = Early life = Norman Milliken was one of 7 children born to Benjamin and Phebe Milliken. He moved to Bocabec, New Brunswick with his father American Loyalist Benjamin Milliken in 1782-1791 after the American War of Independence. In 1803, he left Bocabec and moved to Pennsylvania. He returned to Bocabec in 1805, and then moved to York, Upper Canada and began milling. He married Susannah Walton in Bocebec, New Brunswick, Canada. In 1794, his son, Benjamin Milliken II was born in New Brunswick. He had twelve children.  Milliken's Corner  The rural hamlet of \\"Milliken's Corner\\" was first settled in 1798 by William Dumont. Norman Milliken settled in the area around 1807. In 1807, he founded a small hamlet in Markham, Ontario. Norman, along with two of his brothers established a lumbering business with a contract that supplied the Royal Navy with ship's planking and lumber. They also built a hotel and livery stables. For mill work, he used what was known as \\"German Mills\\" and also rented a flour mill on the west side of Yonge Street for milling lumber.\\"History of Toronto and County of York, Ontario:Biographical Notices\\", 1885, p. 299 Milliken built and operated the first lumber mill in the Township of Markham at German Mills, Ontario to control the drinking habits of the lumbermen. His daughter Charlotte ran the hotel for her father. He subsequently purchased a share in a lumber mill located at Markham Village. In 1814 Norman Milliken received the deed for 200 acres of land at lot 1, concession 5, Markham Township which was the location of Milliken Corners. The rural hamlet of Milliken's Corners eventually consisted of Milliken's Corners Methodist Church, a post office which was established 1858 (northeast corner of Old Kennedy Road and Steeles), a hotel and a general store. The hamlet became a postal village in 1858 and was called Milliken after Norman Millken.  Legacy  The community of Milliken, Ontario, Milliken Mills in Markham, and Milliken Mills High-school were named after Norman Milliken. The Milliken name is also associated with the Township of Markham. The name surname \\"Millikin\\" is likely derived from the double diminutive of 'mael-oc-an' meaning \\"the little bald or shaved one.\\" The city remained a rural community until the 1980s. In the 1980s urbanization had developed in the area and farming stopped.\\"Old Scarboro' in the News; From the Markham Economist, ['Agincourt,' 16 March 1882 (cont'd.)],\\" Scarborough Historical Notes and Comments 5, no. 4 (November 1981): 13.

She had polio as a child. She ran the Disabled Women's Coalition office with Lynn Witt in the 1970s. She worked as a staff member at the Center for Independent Living in Berkeley from 1973‚Äì1976, and as a staff member for the Disability Rights and Education Fund (DREDF) from 1980‚Äì1983. On April 5, 1977, a hundred fifty disabled people stormed into the federal Department of Health, Education, and Welfare building demanding for disability people to be included in the 504 section. O'Toole was a participant in the 504 sit in which lasted for twenty- five days, and it ended in success. Of the protest, she said, \\"At that time in history, there was simply no access no right to an education, no public transit. You couldn't get into a library or city hall, much less a courtroom\\". In the protest, there were many groups who helped contribute to the success of the Sit In such as the Blank Panther Party. This organization had provided the disability community free food during their protest, which showed their support for the disability rights movement. O'Toole was able to contribute to the law which provided aid and assistance to the disability community. In 1980 she established The National Disabled Women's Educational Equity Project in Berkeley, California. Based at DREDF, the Project administered the first national survey on disability and gender and conducted the first national Conference on Disabled Women's Educational Equity held in Bethesda, Maryland. She organized and helped organize the Disabled Women's Symposium, which preceded the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing (1995); the International Conferences on Parents with Disabilities and Their Families (1997; 2002); Funding All Women: Including Women and Girls with Disabilities (1999); and the world's first conference on being Queer and Disabled (2002). She also organized a first-ever briefing for California state legislators on issues of girls and young women with disabilities, in collaboration with the Center for Women Policy Studies (2003). On December 4, 2003, she received a \\"Woman of Valor\\" award from Educational Equity Concepts. In 2016 her book Fading Scars: My Queer Disability History was nominated in the category of LGBT Nonfiction for the 28th Annual Lambda Literary Awards. She is openly lesbian and adopted a daughter from Japan. Partial bibliography O'Toole, C. J. & Bregante, J. L. (1993). Disabled lesbians. In M. Nagler (Ed.) Perspectives on Disability (2nd ed).

(1952, Police nad Metuj√≠, Czechoslovakia ‚Äì 11 September 1993, Lost Arrow, Yosemite National Park, USA) was a Czech rock climber, solo climber, mountaineer, mountain cinematographer and photographer. He also organized climbing and cultural events. In 1981 he founded The International Festival of Mountaineering Films () in Teplice nad Metuj√≠. He also wrote several books.  Life and climbing career  He started climbing in the Osta≈° climbing area and continued in Adr≈°pach-Teplice Rocks, where he climbed a number of famous first ascents. In the High Tatras, Slovakia, he completed 230 ascents (80 of which were in winter and 25 first ascents, including a solo ascent of the Posledn√≠ dostih route on Veƒæk√° Javorov√° ve≈æa in 1976). In Scotland he completed the first winter ascent of the Glover‚Äôs Chimney route on Ben Nevis in 1981. He also completed several solo climbs in Caucasus. He tried to make his solo climbs a secret as they were not approved of by the Socialist Party officials who lead the country at that time. When the solo ascents were revealed, it was very difficult to settle the disagreement. Still, ≈†m√≠d received an honor for his sport activities despite the solo climbing controversy. Miroslav ≈†m√≠d climbed in various mountain areas and made a number of important ascents: the Alps (first ascent in the north face of Eiger in winter in 1978), the Dolomites (north face of Cima Grande in 1975), Norway (Trollryggen in winter 1976), Caucasus (solo winter ascent of Donguz Orun 1983), Pamir Mountains (solo ascent of Peak Korzhenevskaya in 1977 and first ascent in 1979), Fann Mountains, Andes (first ascent of Yerupaj√° Sur, solo climb, 1980) Yosemite (solo ascent of Dihedral Wall on El Capitan 1978), Patagonia (Fitz Roy and Cerro Torre, 1990) and Alaska (Mount McKinley 1989, 1991 and 1993) He ascended Mount Kenya in Africa in 1986. He also participated in expeditions to the Himalayas (Lhotse Shar, Dhaulagiri 1984, Mount Everest 1987) He also undertook demanding solo ascents (e.g. Ama Dablam in 1986). ≈†m√≠d was allured by everything adventurous, and he also became a pioneer of mountain paragliding in Czechoslovakia. His well- known descent from the Bzeduch Mountain in the Caucasus mountain range resulted in serious injury (broken pelvis) after landing on a moraine. ≈†m√≠d died on 11 September 1993 during unclear circumstances while solo climbing on the Lost Arrow in Yosemite National Park.

Cokurtosis is the fourth standardized cross central moment. If two random variables exhibit a high level of cokurtosis they will tend to undergo extreme positive and negative deviations at the same time.  Definition  For two random variables X and Y there are three non- trivial cokurtosis statistics : K(X,X,X,Y) = {\\\\operatorname{E}{\\\\big[(X - \\\\operatorname{E}[X])^3(Y - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y])\\\\big]} \\\\over \\\\sigma_X^3 \\\\sigma_Y}, : K(X,X,Y,Y) = {\\\\operatorname{E}{\\\\big[(X - \\\\operatorname{E}[X])^2(Y - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y])^2\\\\big]} \\\\over \\\\sigma_X^2 \\\\sigma_Y^2}, and : K(X,Y,Y,Y) = {\\\\operatorname{E}{\\\\big[(X - \\\\operatorname{E}[X])(Y - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y])^3\\\\big]} \\\\over \\\\sigma_X \\\\sigma_Y^3}, where E[X] is the expected value of X, also known as the mean of X, and \\\\sigma_X is the standard deviation of X.  Properties  * Kurtosis is a special case of the cokurtosis when the two random variables are identical: :: K(X,X,X,X) = {\\\\operatorname{E}{\\\\big[(X - \\\\operatorname{E}[X])^4\\\\big]} \\\\over \\\\sigma_X^4} = {\\\\operatorname{kurtosis}\\\\big[X\\\\big]}, * For two random variables, X and Y, the kurtosis of the sum, X + Y, is :: \\\\begin{align} K_{X+Y} = {1 \\\\over \\\\sigma_{X+Y}^4} \\\\big[ & \\\\sigma_X^4K_X + 4\\\\sigma_X^3\\\\sigma_YK(X,X,X,Y) + 6\\\\sigma_X^2\\\\sigma_Y^2K(X,X,Y,Y) \\\\ & {} + 4\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y^3K(X,Y,Y,Y) + \\\\sigma_Y^4K_Y \\\\big], \\\\end{align} : where K_X is the kurtosis of X and \\\\sigma_X is the standard deviation of X. * It follows that the sum of two random variables can have kurtosis different from 3 (K_{X+Y} eq 3) even if both random variables have kurtosis of 3 in isolation (K_X = 3 and K_Y = 3). * The cokurtosis between variables X and Y does not depend on the scale on which the variables are expressed. If we are analyzing the relationship between X and Y, the cokurtosis between X and Y will be the same as the cokurtosis between a + bX and c + dY, where a, b, c and d are constants. Examples =Bivariate normal distribution= Let X and Y each be normally distributed with correlation coefficient œÅ. The cokurtosis terms are :K(X,X,Y,Y) = 1+2\\\\rho^2 :K(X,X,X,Y) = K(X,Y,Y,Y) = 3\\\\rho Since the cokurtosis depends only on œÅ, which is already completely determined by the lower-degree covariance matrix, the cokurtosis of the bivariate normal distribution contains no new information about the distribution. It is a convenient reference, however, for comparing to other distributions. =Nonlinearly correlated normal distributions= Let X be standard normally distributed and Y be the distribution obtained by setting X=Y whenever X<0 and drawing Y independently from a standard half-normal distribution whenever X>0. In other words, X and Y are both standard normally distributed with the property that they are completely correlated for negative values and uncorrelated apart from sign for positive values. The joint probability density function is :f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\\\frac{e^{-x^2/2}}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} \\\\left(H(-x)\\\\delta(x-y) + 2H(x)H(y) \\\\frac{e^{-y^2/2}}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\right) where H(x) is the Heaviside step function and Œ¥(x) is the Dirac delta function. The fourth moments are easily calculated by integrating with respect to this density: :K(X,X,Y,Y) = 2 :K(X,X,X,Y) = K(X,Y,Y,Y) = \\\\frac{3}{2}+\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\approx 2.137 It is useful to compare this result to what would have been obtained for an ordinary bivariate normal distribution with the usual linear correlation. From integration with respect to density, we find that the linear correlation coefficient of X and Y is :\\\\rho = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\approx 0.818 A bivariate normal distribution with this value of œÅ would have K(X,X,Y,Y) \\\\approx 2.455 and K(X,X,X,Y) \\\\approx 2.339. Therefore, all of the cokurtosis terms of this distribution with this nonlinear correlation are smaller than what would have been expected from a bivariate normal distribution with œÅ=0.818. Note that although X and Y are individually standard normally distributed, the distribution of the sum X+Y is platykurtic. The standard deviation of the sum is :\\\\sigma_{X+Y} = \\\\sqrt{3 + \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}} Inserting that and the individual cokurtosis values into the kurtosis sum formula above, we have :K_{X+Y} = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi(8+15\\\\pi)}{(2+3\\\\pi)^2} \\\\approx 2.654 This can also be computed directly from the probability density function of the sum: :f_{X+Y}(u) = \\\\frac{e^{-u^2/8}}{2\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} H(-u) + \\\\frac{e^{-u^2/4}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} \\\\operatorname{erf}\\\\left(\\\\frac{u}{2}\\\\right) H(u)  See also  * Moment (mathematics) * Coskewness  References   Further reading  * * Category:Algebra of random variables Category:Theory of probability distributions Category:Statistical deviation and dispersion Category:Summary statistics ","title":"Cokurtosis"},{"id":"45248798","text":"Deva Maanava (Kannada: ‡≤¶‡≥á‡≤µ‡≤Æ‡≤æ‡≤®‡≤µ) is a 1966 Indian Kannada film, directed by C.

Plot As described in a film magazine, Lady Iris Champneys is forced into an unwelcome marriage to the old and cranky but wealthy Earl of Lemister (Ratcliffe) by her penniless parents and almost immediately he divorces her when he discovers her in the room of one of his guests, where she had gone to recover some letters of her sister Muriel (Hawley). Iris has casually met Clement Gaunt (Sills), a former American ace who is now employed as a chauffeur by a neighbor. Clement loses his job and goes to South Africa where he is employed by Schriemann, a Boer farmer. He becomes involved in an unsought and compromising situation with the farmer's wife Hannah (Van Buren). In a fight with Schriemann, the later is shot by his dusky wife. She throws the blame upon Clement, and he hides in the mountains. While replenishing his supplies he spies the exiled Iris, now a proprietress of a hotel where the mounted police congregate. Iris is informed by Mombo (Holland), a former servant of Schriemann, that Clement or \\"Yankee Jim\\" is a murderer. She sends for Jock MacKeinney, leader of the mounted police, and they arrest Clement. Iris has now discovered that Clement is not a murderer, and agrees, upon a coin toss, to marry him if he is set free or that he would submit to arrest. Iris wins the toss and marries Clement, but Jock is not satisfied and trails the couple when they try to escape. After a long chase scene, Clement is caught, but Iris forces a confession from Schriemann's wife, which brings about the happy ending.

He was the son of naturalist Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, and father of Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. Biography Mannerheim wrote the satirical play Ditt och datt when he was a student at Helsinki, in 1858, which caused a political scandal ending in his dismissal from the university and the university rector's resignation. Mannerheim owned Louhisaari Manor in Askainen, Turku and Pori Province, inherited from his father. He married Hedvig Charlotta H√©l√®ne von Julin (d. 1881, daughter of wealthy industrialist Johan Jacob von Julin), with whom he had seven children. He was a founding member of the Kuusankoski paper mill, acting as the company's director from 1872 to 1878. He was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1879, and in 1880 the Louhisaari estate was transferred to his sister Mimmi (Eva Carolina). Mannerheim thereupon eloped to Paris with his mistress, baroness Sofia Nordenstam (d. 1914), where he had a bohemian lifestyle. Meanwhile, his seven children were in the custody of family members after the death of his wife in 1881. Mannerheim married Sofia Nordenstam in 1883, and the couple returned to Finland, where Mannerheim founded an office supplies company in Helsinki in 1887. Named Systema Oy Ab in 1909, the company later became Finland's main importer of typewriters. Mannerheim was also active as a writer and translator, known for his radical liberal opinions. He became active as a resister of the Russification of Finland, and he tried to dissuade his son, who served in the Russian Imperial Army, from joining the Russo- Japanese War.

Loosely adapted from the 1961 novel Le Retour des Cendres (English: The Return from the Ashes) by French author Hubert Monteilhet, the film stars Nina Hoss and Ronald Zehrfeld as Nelly and Johnny Lenz, respectively. Phoenix is set in Germany in the aftermath of World War II, where Nelly, a Jew who managed to survive Auschwitz concentration camp, decides to go back to her husband Johnny in Berlin. She has had to have her face reconstructed owing to a bullet wound, and her husband does not recognize her. The film marks the sixth collaboration between Petzold and Hoss, as well as being the second film in which Hoss and Zehrfeld star opposite each other, after Barbara (2012), also directed by Petzold. Phoenix was released in Germany on 25 September 2014, and in the United States on 24 July 2015. The film received significant critical acclaim, with praise for the film's suspenseful narrative, for its direction, for Hoss's performance, and for its production design and symbolic elements. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD in North America by The Criterion Collection on 26 April 2016. Plot The film follows Nelly Lenz, a Holocaust survivor and former cabaret singer, who returns to Berlin after undergoing facial reconstruction surgery for damage caused by a bullet wound. Following the end of World War II and the liberation of the concentration camps, Nelly returns to Germany with her friend Lene. Here, Lene takes Nelly to a reconstructive plastic surgeon. Although Nelly tells the surgeon that she would like to look exactly as she used to, he is unable to recreate her old face completely and Nelly is disappointed with the final result. Lene finds an apartment for her and Nelly. Since Nelly's family members all died during the war, Nelly has inherited a considerable amount of money. Lene suggests to Nelly that she collect the money and that the two of them travel to Palestine. She believes they will be safe there and can help with the creation of an independent Jewish state. Although Lene warns Nelly that her husband Johnny may have been the one to betray her to the Nazis, Nelly denies this possibility. She leaves the apartment at night to find him. She finds Johnny working in a nightclub called Phoenix. Johnny fails to recognize her, yet says later that she bears an uncanny resemblance to his late wife, Nelly. In order to obtain his wife's inheritance, he asks Nelly to impersonate his wife. Johnny slowly transforms Nelly into an image and performer of her previous self before her arrest. Nelly goes along with Johnny's plan and keeps her true identity concealed, telling Johnny that her name is Esther. Although Lene continues to warn Nelly that Johnny was possibly complicit in her arrest, Nelly maintains a romantic view of the relationship. As Esther, she questions Johnny about his feelings for his wife and his behaviour at the time of her arrest. Johnny avoids answering most of Nelly's questions, wanting her to concentrate on learning to impersonate his wife. Johnny tells Nelly that he plans to stage her \\"return\\" from the camps within the week, and invites several of the couple's old friends to meet her with him at the train station. After spending several days with Johnny, Nelly returns to the apartment she shares with Lene. Here, the landlady informs her that Lene has killed herself, leaving behind a note for Nelly. In this note, Lene admits to Nelly that she knows that Johnny divorced Nelly the day before her arrest. She includes a copy of the divorce decree, which forces Nelly to accept Johnny's betrayal. Nelly keeps this knowledge a secret, meeting Johnny and their old friends at the train station as planned. Later, at the home of one of the friends, Nelly invites the group to listen to her sing, accompanied by Johnny on piano. As Nelly sings, Johnny recognizes her voice and sees the number tattooed on her arm when she was a prisoner in the concentration camps. He stops playing the piano and shows strong feelings of guilt while Nelly finishes the song and walks away.

The novel was freely adapted into the 1965 J. Lee Thompson film Return from the Ashes. In his adaptation, Christian Petzold decided to change the setting to Berlin shortly after the German surrender at the end of World War II. The screenplay was co-written by Petzold and the artist Harun Farocki. It was the last screenplay of Farocki's career. In the process, the scenarists changed the characters' names and occupations. They eliminated the book's narrative device, in which the survivor's daughter Fabienne discovers the story of her mother's and stepfather/lover's relationship through journal entries written by her mother. She is revealed to have died under suspicious circumstances. They also dropped a secondary plot in which Fabienne has developed a relationship with her stepfather, and thus challenges her mother for his affection when identities are ambiguous.

In 1974 she co-founded the Disabled Women's Coalition at the University of California, Berkeley, with Susan Sygall and in the same year she co-founded the Disability Rights Center with Ralph Nader. From 1980 until 1985 she was an attorney for the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF). In 1997, she became the executive director of the World Institute on Disability. She has also worked with the Center for Independent Living, the Disability Law Resource Center, and the Disabled Women's Support Group. Early life and education Deborah Kaplan was born on January 17, 1950 in Cleveland, Ohio. She‚Äôs of Russian descent, her mother Nadia Kaplan was a first‚Äìgeneration immigrant. Her family was constantly on the move due to her father's educational and work prospects. From third to seventh grade she lived in Cohasset, Massachusetts but eventually her family moves to Littleton, Colorado where she attends junior high and high school. After high school, Kaplan and her family move to California in 1967 so she could attend University of California, Santa Cruz and so her father could teach at Stanford University. She graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1971, and had majored in religious studies. Kaplan received her teaching credentials and was a substitute teacher at a public school for awhile. She then started working as a house cleaner and waitress at downtown Santa Cruz. However, after several months of working these jobs, she decided to go to law school and was back at home with her parents in nearby Los Altos, California. During her stay with her parents, she worked as a secretary for a publishing company. In the May of 1972, she went backpacking with her friends in Santa Cruz Mountains. Since it was summer, her and her friends decided to swim in a creek and Kaplan dove into a creek that caused her to break her neck and left her quadriplegic. Kaplan then spent eight to nine months in rehab at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. Kaplan, however, sent in her law applications and also decided to apply to University of California, Berkeley due to it being the only place that had disabled students program. She did her undergraduate study at UC Santa Cruz and obtained her J.D. degree from UC Berkeley.

A chronology of this research is presented here. Paleontologists have recognized that a significant transition occurred between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras at least since the 1820s. Around this time dinosaur fossils were first being described in the scientific literature. Nevertheless, so few dinosaurs were known that the significance of their passing went unrecognized and little scientific effort was exerted toward finding an explanation. As more and more different kinds of dinosaurs were discovered, their extinction and replacement by mammals was recognized as significant but dismissed with little examination as a natural consequence of the mammals' supposed innate superiority. Consequently, paleontologist Michael J. Benton has called the years up to 1920 as the \\"Nonquestion Phase\\" of Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction research. Ideas that evolution might proceed along pre-ordained patterns or that evolutionary lineages might age, deteriorate, and die like individual animals became popular starting in the late 19th century, but were superseded by the Neo- Darwinian synthesis. The aftermath of this transition brought renewed interest to the extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. Paleontologists began dabbling in the subject, proposing environmental changes during the Cretaceous like mountain-building, dropping temperatures or volcanic eruptions as explanation for the extinction of the dinosaurs. Nevertheless, much of the research occurring during this period lacked rigor, evidential support or depended on tenuous assumptions. Michael J. Benton called the years between 1920 and 1970 the \\"Dilettante Phase\\" of Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction research. In 1970, paleontologists began studying the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction in a detailed, rigorous way. Benton considered this to be the beginning of the \\"Professional Phase\\" of Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction research. Early in this phase, the pace of the extinctions and the potential role of the Deccan Traps volcanism in India were major subjects of interest. In 1980, father and son duo Luis and Walter Alvarez reported anomalously high levels of the platinum group metal iridium from the K‚ÄìPg boundary, but because iridium is rare in Earth's crust they argued that an asteroid impact was needed to account for it. This suggestion set off a bitter controversy. Evidence for an impact continued to mount, like the discovery of shocked quartz at the K‚ÄìPg boundary. In 1991, Alan Hildebrand and William Boynton reported the Chicxulub crater in the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico as a probable impact site. While the controversy continued, the accumulating evidence gradually began to sway the scientific community toward the Alvarez hypothesis. In 2010, an international panel of researchers concluded that impact best explained the extinction event and that Chicxulub was indeed the resulting crater. Because the estimated date of the object's impact and the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (K‚ÄìPg boundary) coincide, there is now a scientific consensus that this impact was the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event which caused the death of most of the planet's non-avian dinosaurs and many other species. The impactor's crater is just over 177 kilometers in diameter, making it the third largest known impact crater on Earth. 19th century Portrait of Georges Cuvier, who recognized the vast difference in the faunas of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras =1820s= 1825 * Georges Cuvier recognized that significant changes to Earth's biota occurred between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic eras. Because the most familiar and distinctive Mesozoic lifeforms known at the time were marine, he speculated that life had not yet fully conquered the land. He attributed the end-Cretaceous mass extinction to a catastrophic drop in sea levels that destroyed the habitats of the era's characteristic fauna. He concluded that the mammals of the Cenozoic represented Earth's first truly terrestrial fauna. =1830s= 1831 * Gideon Mantell recognized dinosaurs as evidence for reptilian dominance over the land in addition to the dominion over the sea held by ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. He therefore declared the Mesozoic era to be the \\"Age of Reptiles\\". Distinguishing the Mesozoic \\"Age of Reptiles\\" from the Cenozoic \\"Age of Mammals\\" highlighted the differences these two eras of geologic time. =1840s= 1842 * Sir Richard Owen proposed that the major reptile groups of the Mesozoic were driven extinct as the oxygen contents of Earth's atmosphere rose to levels better suited for birds and mammals. =1850s= Othniel Charles Marsh interpreted the extinction of the dinosaurs as a gradual process 1854 * Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species. He regarded the extinction of most taxonomic groups as occurring gradually through the piecemeal loss of member species. However, he considered the extinction of the ammonites at the end of the Mesozoic to have been \\"wonderfully sudden\\". =1880s= 1882 * Othniel Charles Marsh interpreted the extinction of the dinosaurs as a gradual decline over the course of the Cretaceous. =1890s= 1898 * Arthur Smith Woodward also advocated that the dinosaurs gradually declined into extinction late in the Mesozoic. 20th century An early 20th century restoration of Stegosaurus by Charles R. Knight =1900s= 1905 * Loomis argued that the plates adorning the backs of stegosaurs were maladaptive traits that sapped their vigor and signaled their impending extinction. Similar arguments would later be extended to the extinction of the dinosaurs overall by Woodward in 1910. =1910s= The enlarged pituitary of a human with acromegaly 1910 * Woodward gave an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in which he declared the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs to be \\"racial senility\\"- the idea that evolutionary lineages had finite lifespans the way individual organisms do and also exhibit age-related deterioration over time as well. Woodward argued that traits like large size, spiny coverings and lack of teeth seen in some later dinosaurs were signs that the group was approaching its inevitable end. 1917 * Franz Nopcsa suggested that dinosaurs may have developed overactive pituitary glands that led them to become pathologically gigantic in an evolutionary parallel to acromegaly in modern humans. He also suggested that a \\"[d]iminution of sexual activity\\" may have played a role in their demise. =1920s= 1921 * William Diller Matthew argued that dinosaurs were gradually driven extinct as geologic uplift replaced the wet lowland habitats Matthew thought dinosaurs were best adapted to with the more elevated terrain he thought was preferred by mammals. Deforming arthrides in dinosaur vertebrae 1922 * Nopcsa proposed a model for the extinction of the dinosaurs similar to Matthew's but with greater emphasis on the implications the uplifted terrain had for the plants they depended on. He also suggested that competition from mammals that arrived in North America from Asia played a role. * N. M. Jakolev proposed that the dinosaur went extinct because Earth's climate became too cold to sustain them. 1923 * Roy Lee Moodie proposed that dinosaurs were killed off by diseases. Examples of the pathological health conditions Moodie thought contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs included arthritis, dental cavities, fractures, and infections. 1925 * Paleobotanist George Wieland hypothesized that Tyrannosaurus rex survived on a diet of eggs. He argued that feeding its great bulk would have led it to consume the entire last generation of dinosaurs before they could even hatch, leading to their extinction. He also suggested that mammals may have driven the dinosaurs extinct by eating all of their eggs. 1928 * L. M√ºller proposed that volcanic eruptions drove the dinosaurs extinct. * H. T. Marshall suggested that bombardment from cosmic or ultraviolet radiation caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. 1929 * A. Audova analyzed the circumstances of the extinction of the dinosaurs and concluded that they were driven extinct gradually when Earth's climate cooled too severely for their embryos to fully develop in the egg. He dismissed the idea that they went extinct due to factors like racial senility. =1930s= brains of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus 1939 * P. E. Raymond suggested that dinosaur brain size diminished over the course of the Mesozoic until, in effect, they became too stupid to live and went extinct. * W. E. Swinton argued that dinosaurs were driven extinct when the lakes and swamps they inhabited dried up. =1940s= 1942 * Wieland suggested that the dinosaurs were driven extinct when the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere decreased until it was too low to instigate them to breathe and they suffocated. 1945 * R. B. Cowles proposed that the dinosaurs went extinct when Earth's climate became so hot and dry that it affected the ability of male dinosaurs to produce sperm cells. 1946 * Edwin Harris Colbert and others proposed that the dinosaurs went extinct when Earth's climate became too hot and dry to support them. 1949 * Cowles proposed that in addition to preventing dinosaurs from producing sperm, elevating temperatures and aridity at the end of the Mesozoic would have killed vulnerable young dinosaurs, another factor that could have contributed to their extinction. * M. Wilfarth argued that dinosaurs were marine animals and were driven extinct by decreasing sea levels during the Late Cretaceous, which dried out their habitats. =1950s= A solar flare 1950s * Petroleos Mexicanos, also known as PEMEX, discovered an unusual subsurface circular structure in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. 1954 * E. Stechow proposed that the extinction of the dinosaurs may be attributable to solar flares that destroyed the ozone layer, allowing ultraviolet radiation to shower the planet. 1956 * M. W. de Laubenfels hypothesized that at the end of the Cretaceous, a bolide entered Earth's atmosphere, \\"[f]lash heating\\" it and incinerating the dinosaurs. =1960s= A swarm of caterpillars denuding a plant of vegetation 1960s * PEMEX began drilling into the unusual ring-like structure under the Yucatan and extracting rock cores in search of oil. 1962 * S. E. Flanders suggested that at the end of the Cretaceous caterpillars began multiplying until they had so denuded the contemporary plant life that nothing was left for the dinosaurs, who starved to death. 1967 * J. M. Cys argued that dinosaurs went extinct because they were unable to hibernate during the winter, leaving them doomed by Earth's changing climate. 1968 * D. Axelrod and H. P. Bailey proposed that the dinosaurs were driven extinct when Earth's climate began exhibiting more marked seasons rather than stable conditions year-round. * H. Tappan suggested that the dinosaurs were driven extinct as Earth's terrestrial environments began to flatten out elimintated their preferred habitats. * K. D. Terry and W. H. Tucker suggested that the dinosaurs may have been driven extinct by ionizing radiation. =1970s= A Pemex gas station in Mexico 1970s * PEMEX continued looking for oil deposits associated with a large circular structure in the Yucatan Peninsula. 1970 * C. B. Hatfield and M. J. Camp suggested that the dinosaurs went extinct due to Earth's \\"[o]scillations about the galactic plane\\". 1971 * D. A. Russel and Tucker proposed that a nearby supernova emitted a burst of electromagnetic radiations and cosmic rays that killed off the dinosaurs. A map showing the location of the large igneous provinces of the world. The Deccan Traps are represented by the purple region in India 1972 * Peter Vogt reported evidence of intense volcanic activity occurring in India around the end of the Cretaceous. He hypothesized that this volcanic activity released poisonous trace elements which brought about the mass extinction. 1973 * Harold Urey argued that comet impacts may have caused mass extinctions in the past and may have been responsible for demarcating the periods of the geologic time scale. 1974 * Jan Smit began studying the extinction of foraminifera at the K‚ÄìT boundary in Caravaca, Spain. He observed that some of these extinctions must have been rapid. 1976 A panorama of Gubbio, Italy * T. Swain proposed that when flowering plants evolved their tissues contained alkaloids and tannins that poisoned the dinosaurs, leading to their extinction. 1977 * Alvarez and others published their research on the magnetic reversals of the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary interval recorded in the rocks at Gubbio, Italy. They proposed that these rocks be regarded as the standard to which other rocks thought to be of this age are compared. * Spring: Jan Smit sent 100 rock samples from the K‚ÄìT boundary at Caravaca to a laboratory in Delft for compositional analysis. The results uncovered high levels of metals like antimony, chromium, cobalt, nickel, and selenium. These unusual findings led Smit to suspect that the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous may have had an extraterrestrial cause. Deccan Traps volcanism was hypothesized to have been a main causative factor in the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene mass extinction * Robert T. Bakker argued that Earth's terrain flattened out during the Late Cretaceous, reducing the area of the dinosaurs' preferred habitats and helping to drive them to extinction. 1978 * B. W. Oelofsen argued that kimberlite volcanoes were very common during the Late Cretaceous and emitted large quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The coincidental drop in sea level at this time period led to a drop in the population of phytoplankton that would have otherwise ingested the excess . The unchecked levels would make it difficult for warm-blooded dinosaur eggs buried in nests to obtain enough oxygen through passive gas exchange with the atmosphere and the embryos would suffocate. By contrast cold blooded animals would have lower oxygen demands and may have been able to endure these conditions, explaining the survival of other egg-laying reptile groups. * Dewey McLean argued that volcanic emissions during the Cretaceous led to a greenhouse effect that altered earth's climate and ocean currents, leading to the extinction at the end of the period. * Penfield and Camargo detected a giant sub-surface crater in the Yucatan Peninsula because of its unusual magnetic and gravitational signature. Fragments of iridium * Cloudsley-Thompson suggested that if dinosaurs were warm-blooded, increasing temperatures could have caused them to overheat and driven them extinct. 1979 * H. K. Erben and others reported that eggs attributed to Hypselosaurus exhibit increasing rates of paleopathology like overly thick or thin eggshell or eggs with multiple shell layers through an Upper Cretaceous stratigraphic interval in France. The researchers speculated that a mutation leading to fatal shell deformities may have spread through the population in defiance of natural selection until fatal eggshell anomalies were so common that the species went extinct. Alternatively, stressful living conditions could have prompted the formation of eggs with multiple shell layers as observed in modern turtles. They speculated that an overly favorable climate could have led to extreme fertility rates. The soaring dinosaur population became overcrowded until the stress from this overcrowding prevented dinosaurs from laying healthy eggs, leading to their extinction. * Russel reviewed various proposed hypotheses for the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. He concluded that the only viable proposal was that the dinosaurs had been wiped out by radiation emitted by a nearby supernova. * West published an article in New Scientist magazine discussing the Alvarez team's discovery of high iridium concentrations at the K‚ÄìT boundary in Gubbio. Smit read this article and was startled by the discovery. He wondered how much iridium was present in his own samples of the K‚ÄìT boundary from Caravaca. He sent the samples to Belgium where they were found to have five times the iridium present in the Alvarez team's samples from Gubbio. * September: A conference on the K‚ÄìT boundary was held in Copenhagen, Denmark. Proposals for an extraterrestrial cause of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction were rejected by all of attendees but Jan Smit and Walter Alvarez. These became close friends based on their shared support for extraterrestrial hypotheses, although Smit was still more sympathetic to the supernova hypothesis. * December: Smit received a pre-print copy of the paper written by the Alvarez team documenting their discovery of iridium at the K‚ÄìT boundary and interpretation of it as the fingerprints of an asteroid impact. =1980s= Walter Alvarez in 2012 1980 * Alvarez and others reported spikes in the level of platinum group metals like iridium at the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary in Italy, Denmark, and New Zealand. They interpreted this sudden introduction of rare-earth metals as evidence for an asteroid impact, to which they attributed the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous Period. * Smit and Hertogen independently reported the presence of an iridium spike at the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary in Spain, which they also attributed to the impact of an extra terrestrial body and credited with the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary extinctions. * May: Smit and Hertogen published the results of their research on the K‚ÄìT boundary at Caravaca and proposed that an asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous triggered the coeval mass extinction. * June 6th: Alvarez and others published their hypothesis that an impact event cause the extinction of the dinosaurs. * Penfield wrote to Walter Alvarez, suggesting the Yucatan structure as the possible crater of the end-Cretaceous impactor, but received no response. spore-bearing structures of a modern fern 1981 * Orth and others reported a sudden \\"spike\\" in the quantity of fossil fern spores near the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary, \\"just above the iridium-bearing clay\\". They also reported an iridium spike at the K‚ÄìT Boundary in Colorado and Utah. Since these rocks were deposited by freshwater, their discovery bolstered the impact hypothesis by refuting attempts to explain away the K‚ÄìT boundary's high iridium concentrations as a result of chemical or sedimentary processes occurring in the ocean. This is consistent with the impact event because ferns have been observed to rapidly recolonize areas rendered desolate by modern natural disasters. * Philip Kerourio debunked Erben and others' suggestion that an increase in the incidence of pathological eggs in dinosaurs led to their extinction. He found that only 0.5‚Äì2.5% of eggs in the area Erben and the others studied had multiple shell layers and observed no evidence that these pathologies became more common through the Late Cretaceous. * A conference dedicated to the end-Cretaceous extinction event was held at Utah's Snowbird ski resort. By this point in time, 36 K‚ÄìT boundary sites with anomalously high iridium levels had been identified. At the conference, Yale geochemist Karl Turekian disputed the impact hypothesis. He expressed interest in debunking the idea by demonstrating that the isotope ratios of osmium in the rocks of the K‚ÄìT boundary were typical for rocks of the earth's crust but inconsistent with those in meteorites. * Wezel and others reported high iridium levels at Gubbio both far above and below the K‚ÄìT boundary. They also reported spherules likewise above and below the boundary layer and therefore concluded that the spherules could not have been produced by a bolide impact. * Penfield and Camargo reported the existence a crater dating to the K‚ÄìT boundary in the Yucatan Peninsula during a presentation to the Society of Exploration Geophysicists. They proposed that this crater may have been caused by the same impact event to which Alvarez had recently attributed the mass extinction at the end of the period. * Paleontologist Peter Ward reported in a presentation to colleagues at Berkeley that his research supported the idea of a rapid extinction of the ammonites at the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary.A diagram explaining the Signor‚ÄìLipps effect * Clemons, Archibald and others published one of the first rebuttals to the Alvarez hypothesis. They argued that the fossil record of contemporary plants shows a gradual progressive adaptation of the flora to colder temperatures as the Cretaceous ended and the Tertiary began. 1982 * Philip Signor and Jere Lipps argued that extinctions can appear more gradual in the fossil record than actually transpired because any given level in the stratum will preserve fewer than the interval overall. They observed a strong correlation between the area of rock deposited during a given time interval and that time interval's biodiversity. This observation is attributable to the obvious fact that the biodiversity of a time interval can only be inferred from fossils preserved in rocks deposited then. If fewer rocks are known from a given time, then there are also fewer potential sources of fossils. This can mislead scientists into thinking that the biodiversity of a taxon was declining, when in actuality there are simply fewer sources of fossils for the later members of the group. * Toon and others argued that dust ejected into the atmosphere by an asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous would have lowered temperatures on land to near freezing levels for 45 days to six months. This scenario is known as \\"impact winter\\". The oceans however would only see a slight temperature drop due to their greater heat capacity. * Hsu and others argued based on carbon isotopic evidence that photosynthesis in ocean plankton nearly completely halted at the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary. They nicknamed this scenario the \\"Strangelove Ocean\\". A Brazilian foraminiferan microfossil dating to shortly after the end of the Cretaceous * Dale Russell argued that since the Campanian age was twice as long as the Maastrichtian, one would expect it to have twice as many dinosaur species, so a disparity between the two is not necessarily evidence that they were in decline. * Archibald and Clemens argued that the floral and faunal turnover from the Mesozoic to Cenozoic was gradual. They rejected the impact hypothesis, regarding either a super nova or an influx of Arctic seawater into more southerly waters that lowered global temperatures. * October: Luis Alvarez made \\"a pre-emptive declaration of victory\\" for the impact hypothesis to the National Academy of Sciences. This brash claim would earn him ire from geologists and paleontologists alike. * Hans Thierstein found that 97% of foraminiferan species and 92% of their genera went extinct at the K‚ÄìT boundary. * Jan Smit reported that the only foraminiferan species to survive the Cretaceous was Guembelitria cretacea, and that all subsequent foraminiferans were its descendants. * Ferguson and Joanen proposed that an increasingly hot and dry climate could have skewed the ratio of male to female dinosaur hatchlings, leading to their extinction. * McLean attributed the extinction of the dinosaurs to volcanism at the end of the Cretaceous. A sample of the iridium-rich Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary from Wyoming 1983 * Anomalously high quantities of platinum group metals were discovered in terrestrial deposits laid down at the time of the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary in the western United States. The presence of these metals in terrestrial rocks bolstered the asteroid impact hypothesis by overturning alternative explanations for the iridium spike as resulting from earthly chemical processes concentrating them in seawater. * Pollock and others estimated that the asteroid impact that caused the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction ejected into the atmosphere brought on 3 months of darkness. * Luck and Turekian demonstrated that the isotope ratios of osmium in the rocks of the K‚ÄìT Boundary were more typical for a meteorite than those of the earth's crust, confirming rather than debunking the impact hypothesis. * By the end of the year, 50 K‚ÄìT boundary sites with anomalously high iridium levels had been identified. * Charles Officer and Charles Drake published their first attack on the impact hypothesis. They synthesized previously published data on 15 core samples containing the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary taken from various places around the world, including undersea. They found three of the samples to have been formed during periods of different polarities of earth's magnetic field. This meant that the rock record of the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary transition had a different absolute age at different locations and any physical commonality shared between these rocks of different ages could not have resulted from a single instantaneous event. They also argued that the elevated iridium concentrations at the K‚ÄìT boundary were spread gradually across about 60 cm of the stratigraphic column, rather than increasing sharply in a \\"spike\\" right at the boundary itself. * Montanari and others interpreted feldspar spherules from Caravaca as impact ejecta that had melted and rehardened. * The paper that served as the basis for Luis Alvarez's declaration of victory speech to the National Academy of sciences was published. He expressed shock that paleontologists lacked sufficient \\"respect\\" to see dinosaurs as capable of persisting in the face of mundane environmental changes compared to his own view that only a devastating catastrophe like an impact event could have led to their extinction. * Luis Alvarez gave a presentation to the National Academy of Sciences where he proposed that all of earth's mass extinctions were due to impact events. * Keith proposed that increasing levels of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere caused oceans to stagnate, which led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. The Snowbird Ski Resort, site of the contentious Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event conferences 1984 * Bohor and his team found the K‚ÄìT boundary at a centimeter-thick claystone in Montana. Their examination uncovered evidence for the disappearance from the rock record of many different kinds of fossil pollen, as well as anomalously high iridium levels. Bohor and his colleagues' status as geologists and familiar methodology helped the impact hypothesis gain credibility among fellow researchers who were reluctant to consider proposals from scholars outside the field. * Alvarez and others published a rebuttal to Officer and Drake's 1983 paper that attempted to refute the impact hypothesis through magnetostratigraphy. They criticized Officer and Drake for having ignored the research presented at the first Snowbird conference, despite Drake having attended and even previously publishing on some of that very research. The Alvarez team also criticized Officer and Drake for relying on data published by other workers who questioned their own results. For instance, one of the K‚ÄìT boundary-bearing core samples that supposedly formed at a different time than the others was heavily bioturbated according to the researchers who first studied it. These previous workers acknowledged that the modifications the sampled sediments experienced between deposition and lithification made them unreliable for paleomagnetic dating. Alvarez and his collaborators concluded that Officer and Drake were cherry picking the available data for any evidence that could be marshaled against the impact hypothesis while ignoring the vast quantity that supported it. They also reported the results of their attempt to relocate the high iridium concentrations that Wezel and others reported from sections of the rocks at Gubbio other than the K‚ÄìT boundary. Despite their re- examinations of the rocks there, they could find no evidence of high iridium levels anywhere other than the boundary itself. They concluded that the Wezel team's anomalous iridium readings were the result of contamination. * Dewey McLean claims to have endured a campaign of persecution from Luis Alvarez resulting in so much stress that he spent this entire year suffering from crippling joint pain. * Bevan French estimated that the end-Cretaceous impact must have occurred within 3500 km of Montana, based on the shocked quartz discovered there. * Summer: A poll of more than 600 paleontologists and other earth scientists found 24% to support the impact hypothesis of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, 38% agreed that the impact occurred but was not the true cause of the mass extinction, 26% denied that any impact had occurred and 12% completely denied the occurrence of a mass extinction at all. * Smit and van der Kaars argued that the K‚ÄìT boundary in the Hell Creek formation occurred 2‚Äì12 m lower than researchers had previously realized, giving the illusory impression that dinosaurs had died out there before the end of the period. They also argued that the \\"Z\\" coal beds of the formation used to mark the beginning of the Cenozoic were actually different ages at different exposures and were not useful stratigraphic demarcators. A modern wildfire 1985 * Wolbach and others reported the results of their attempt to locate noble gases at the K‚ÄìT Boundary in Denmark which could have been left by an impactor. Serendipitously they found high concentrations of soot at the boundary. If the boundary layer had indeed formed rapidly, then this soot may have been left by wildfires that consumed up to 90% of earth's terrestrial biomass. * Officer and Drake published their second attack on the impact hypothesis. They argued that the high iridium reported from the K‚ÄìT boundary was introduced gradually by volcanic activity, not suddenly by a bolide impact. They also disputed the attribution of fracture planes in shocked quartz to the forces generated by the supposed end-Cretaceous impact event and instead argued that these fracture planes could have been generated by mundane geologic forces like mount-building and metamorphism. They argued that since geologic structures preserved at Sudbury Basin and Vredefort Crater preserve shocked quartz of terrestrial origin, it cannot be used as evidence for an impact. They observed that volcanologists studying the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii found the aerosols it emitted to contain iridium levels similar to those of meteorites. A sedimentary rock showing signs of bioturbation * Smit and Kyte criticized Officer and Drake's interpretation of the effects bioturbation would have on sediments laid down at the K‚ÄìT boundary. Officer and Drake operated under the assumption that bioturbation would only affect a few centimeters of sediments, so the activities of animals living in the sediment would not penetrate deeply enough to spread rapidly deposited iridium that far down. However, Smit and Kyte pointed out that tektites are present across a 60 cm span at the boundary. They argued that since the tektites must have been deposited rapidly and were reworked to that depth, rapidly deposited iridium could have been as well. * Bevan French, an expert on shock metamorphism, rejected Officer and Drake's claim that mountain-building or volcanism could account for the fracture planes in the shocked quartz found at the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary. * Officer presented Wezel's report of spherules away from the K‚ÄìT boundary in an address to a meeting of the American Geophysical Union. After the presentation Walter Alvarez pointed out that some of the purported spherules were actually modern insect eggs that the researchers had failed to clean off their specimens. An ammonoid * Smit and Romein interpreted a turbidite deposit from Brazos, Texas as the probable legacy of an impact-generated tsunami. They attributed the Texan turbidite to the tsunami because of its close association with the iridium-bearing K‚ÄìT boundary and its status as the only turbidite deposit in the region. 1986 * Sheehan and Hansen observed that taxa dependent on photosynthesis-based food chains experienced greater losses than those which could rely on detritus. Examples of taxa that suffered major or complete extinctions include ammonites, plankton, and some mollusks. * Officer and Ekdale disputed the interpretation of deposits at Stevns Klint, Denmark as soot rapidly deposited by global wildfires in the wake of an asteroid impact. They argued that the complex stratigraphy and abundant burrow fossils they observed in these deposits suggested that the strata took much longer to form than can be accounted for by the wildfire hypothesis. * Kyte and Wasson examined the iridium contents of a long core sample extracted from the Pacific Ocean. This sample contained sediments ranging from 35 to 67 million years in age. The researchers found very low levels of iridium throughout the sample, except for at the K‚ÄìT Boundary. This bolstered the impact hypothesis by demonstrating the scarcity of iridium in earth's crust over time, which is consistent with the interpretation that it originated with an unusual event. The resonance structures of nitric acid * Naslund and others also reported spherules above and below the K‚ÄìT boundary at Gubbio. They estimated that the spherule-bearing interval took about 22 million years to be deposited and the spherules couldn't have been a result of an impact event. 1987 * Prinn and Fegley argued that the energy of an asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous period would have led atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen to react, forming large quantities of nitric acid that would have fallen back to earth in the form of acid rain. * Bohor and others reported shocked quartz from seven more K‚ÄìT boundary exposures. They also studied quartz from Mount Toba, where shock fractures were much less common and simpler in structure than quartz from the K‚ÄìT boundary. * December: Brian Huber disembarked on a ship from Mauritius to Desolation Island off the coast of Antarctica in order to drill core samples from the seafloor. The sample taken off the coast of Desolation Island showed a sharp K‚ÄìT boundary with abundant foraminiferan fossils below it and few above it. The finding convinced Huber of the impact hypothesis. 1988 Luis Alvarez * A conference dedicated to the end-Cretaceous extinction event was held at Utah's Snowbird Ski resort. * Alexopoulos and others compared quartz grains from rocks that had been subjected to various types of geologic forces like bolide impact, volcanism, or tectonic deformation with quartz from the K‚ÄìT boundary layer. They found that quartz could exhibit shock fractures resulting from any of the studied forces, but the shock fractures exhibited by the impact site and the K‚ÄìT boundary were both identical to each other and distinct from those found in the other rocks. * Felitsyn and Vaganov found high levels of iridium in volcanic ejecta from Kamchatka. This provided evidence that terrestrial geologic processes could leave high levels of iridium behind in the rock record without need for an impact to explain them. * Kevin O. Pope and Charles Duller presented their discovery of a configuration of small ponds \\"arranged along the arc of an almost perfect circle\\" in satellite images of the Yucatan peninsula. Geologist Adriana Ocampo suggested that the arc of ponds may represent the surface evidence of a buried impact crater and the researchers began a collaboration to investigate the possibility. * Bourgeois and others attributed the Texan turbidite deposit studied by Smit and Romein to a tsunami 50-100m high. * September 1st: Luis Alvarez died. * Ward reported that ammonites persisted up to the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary after all. After finding a partial ammonite fossil \\"within inches of the boundary\\" at Zumaya, Ward began prospecting at other places in Europe where the K‚ÄìT Boundary was exposed. At Hendaye, France he nearly instantly found abundant ammonites near the boundary, leading him to conclude that the scarcity of ammonites at Zumaya was purely local and unrelated to their overall extinction. * Hickey and Kirk Johnson reported that after studying more than 25,000 plant fossils collected across western North America they had concluded that 79% of contemporary plants went extinct at the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary. Hickey and Johnson embraced the idea of a catastrophic end-Cretaceous mass extinction after having previously denouncing it. Even Archibald was forced to admit that there had been a catastrophic extinction of plant life at the end of the Cretaceous due to this study. * Gerta Keller reported her findings on foraminiferans after having collected their fossils from the Brazos region of Texas and El Kef, Tunisia. She found that 35‚Äì40% of foraminiferans had gone extinct 300,000‚Äì400,000 years prior to the K‚ÄìT boundary. She argued that this ruled out the possibility that they were victims of a catastrophic mass extinction event. * Hut and others suggested that the impact at the end of the Cretaceous might actually have been one of a series of impacts that all contributed the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. sex-determination in reptiles 1989 * Paladino and others hypothesized that if dinosaurs had temperature-dependent sex determination then rapid climate change at the end of the Cretaceous could have led to strongly imbalanced sex ratios among the ensuing generations. If the male to female ratio was sufficiently imbalanced, there may not have been enough prospective mates to go around and the population could crash, leading to their extinction. * Gostin and others reported gold and platinum group metals at the 600 million year old site of Acraman crater, Australia. This proved that impact events could introduce elevated iridium levels to the rock record. * Koeberl reported the presence of high iridium levels in volcanic dust under Antarctic ice. This provided evidence that terrestrial geologic processes could leave high levels of iridium behind in the rock record without need for an impact to explain them. * June: Alan Hildebrand visited Florentin Maurasse, a geologist who had reported the discovery of intriguing Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary rocks in southern Haiti that Hildebrand hoped may provide evidence for the extinction-triggering impact crater. Hildebrand realized that some samples Maurasse attribute to volcanism were actually evidence of an impact and set out to perform his own field work in Haiti. =1990s= The gravitational anomalies signaling the presence of the Chicxulub Crater 1990 * Courtillot calculated that the volcanism that formed the Deccan Traps may have gradually released as much as two million cubic kilometers of lava spread over a two million square kilometer area. He also dated this volcanic activity paleomagnetostratigraphically from 30 normal to 29 normal. The K‚ÄìT boundary itself lay at 29 reversed and Courtillot found this to apparently coincide with the peak of Deccan Trap volcanism. * The Chicxulub Crater in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula was rediscovered. * Peter Dodson performed a survey of dinosaur biodiversity and found no support for the hypothesis that the group was in terminal decline during the Late Cretaceous. * Ursula Marvin argued that the asteroid impact explanation for the end-Cretaceous mass extinction was at odds with the idea of uniformitarianism and criticized those who attempt to reconcile the two as engaging in \\"newspeak\\". * Alvarez and Asaro measured the iridium levels of a 57m span of rock near the K‚ÄìT boundary at Gubbio once more. They estimate that it took roughly 10 million years for the sediments composing these rocks to be deposited. Their analysis found low iridium levels throughout the sampled interval of strata except at the K‚ÄìT boundary, where there was a tremendous spike in iridium content accompanied by trivially elevated levels immediately above and below it. James Lawrence Powell characterized their results as consistent with those of the Rocchia team. * May: Hildebrand and Boynton published the result of a literature search for craters that could have resulted from the end-Cretaceous impact event. They concluded that the best candidate was a buried crater on the seafloor north of Colombia, but noted that the nature of the ejecta preserved at K‚ÄìT boundary sites around the world are inconsistent with a marine impact. They also briefly mentioned a potential crater reported from the Yucatan Peninsula, but did not examine the possibility in-depth. However, in doing so they \\"scooped\\" Pope, Duller, and Ocampo who were completely unaware of Hildebrand and Boynton's work. Pope reached out to Hildebrand, who responded with an unpublished manuscript detailing his intent to name the crater Chicxulub. * Keith Meldahl verified the Signor‚ÄìLipps effect experimentally by taking core samples of mud at a modern tidal flat in Mexico. His samples contained a total of 45 species, of which 35 disappeared from the sample at some point below the top, as if this tidal flat ecosystem was experiencing a gradual mass extinction when in fact every species in the sample was still alive. * Keller and Barrera published their research indicating that significant foraminiferan extinctions occurring hundreds of thousands of years before the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary. Location of the Chicxulub Crater on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico 1991 * Hildebrand and Boynton declared the Chicxulub Crater to be the result of the impact that triggered the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. * Hildebrand and others estimated the diameter of the Chicxulub Crater at 170 kilometers. * Sheehan and others collected dinosaur fossils from the lower, middle, and upper Hell Creek Formation in North Dakota and Montana. They found no evidence for a gradual decline in dinosaur biodiversity toward the end of the Late Cretaceous, nor did they find any evidence for a change in the proportions of various dinosaur groups composing the Hell Creek's megafauna. Sheehan and the other researchers concluded that a catastrophic extinction scenario best explained the results of their analysis. * Carlisle and Braman reported the anomalous presence of tiny diamonds at the K‚ÄìT boundary in Alberta, Canada. Diamonds like these can form in explosions and are found in meteorites, so diamonds at the K‚ÄìT boundary support the impact hypothesis. * Penfield published a letter in Natural History objecting to Hildebrand's claim to have identified the Chicxulub Crater as \\"ground zero\\" to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. He pointed out that he proposed that very hypothesis back in 1981. * Pope and others finally published their research that had been \\"scooped\\" by Hildebrand and Boynton. * Izett and others radiometrically dated spherules from the K‚ÄìT boundary of Haiti to an age of 64.5 million years. They found feldspar from the K‚ÄìT boundary of the Hell Creek Formation to be 64.6 million years old. Chemical structure of sulfuric acid 1992 * Sigurdsson and others concluded that global mean temperatures dropped 2‚Äì3 degrees celsius across the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary. They also argued that evaporite material ejected from the impact site could have formed sulfuric acid in the atmosphere that would fall back to earth as acid rain. * Johnson found that the position of the coal layers once thought to mark the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary between the Late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation and Paleocene Tullock Formation may deviate from the actual boundary \\"by as much as 5 m\\". * Officer and others argued that the Chicxulub Crater was formed by volcanic activity rather than an impact event. * Swisher and others dated the formation of the Chicxulub Crater to 65 million years ago. More precisely, they dated igneous rock from the Chicxulub crater to 64.98 million years ago. * Sheehan and Fastovsky found terrestrial vertebrates to be the primary victims of the end Cretaceous extinction event, with 88% of their biodiversity lost. Freshwater vertebrates only lost 10% of their biodiversity across the boundary and the researchers found this divide in habitat preference to be the single greatest source of variation in survivorship rates among the taxa they studied. They observed that the better survival rates among aquatic tetrapods as opposed to terrestrial ones was consistent with the idea of an extensive period of darkness following an asteroid impact. This is due to aquatic ecosystems being less dependent on primary productivity than terrestrial ones because many aquatic tetrapods would be able to subsist on detritus and scavenged remains until photosynthesis resumed. * Smit and others reported the presence of another tsunami deposit at Arroyo el Mimbral, Mexico. Evidence that it formed as a result of a tsunami connected with the end-Cretaceous impact include elevated iridium levels, fossils of terrestrial plants, shocked minerals, and tektites. Map of New Zealand 1993 * Lecuyer and others concluded that mean temperatures in some areas dropped as much as 8 degrees celsius following the Cretaceous. * Johnson saw no evidence for any \\"biotic upheaval\\" in the fossil pollen and spores of the latest Cretaceous of New Zealand. * Dewey McLean accused the journal Science of bias favoring the impact hypothesis. He counted a total of 45 pro-impact papers published by the journal since the hypothesis was first proposed in contrast to only four anti-impact papers. Dan Koshland, the journal's editor, denied showing favoritism to either hypothesis. * Izett and others radiometrically dated the Manson crater again, but found an age of 73.8 million years, too old for it to be the end-Cretaceous impact crater. To confirm this new measurement the team examined rocks of that age in South Dakota. Their fieldwork turned up a layer of shocked minerals, confirming that an impact occurred in the region at that time and thus the revised date was the true age of the Manson crater. * Blum and others compared the isotope ratios of neodymium, oxygen, and strontium found in the Haitan tektites with the igneous rock from the Chicxulub crater. Their results indicated that the crater and the tektites had identical isotope ratios and they concluded that the tektites and the rock \\"come from the same source\\". * Stinnesbeck and others disputed Smit and others' attribution of the Arroyo el Mimbral deposits to a tsunami and supposed connection to a nearby impact. Instead, they attributed the Arroyo el Mimbral deposits to \\"coastal sediments [that] slumped into deeper water\\", a completely mundane occurrence. * Bohor and others reported the presence of zircon grains at the K‚ÄìT boundary in Colorado which exhibit similar shock deformation to that commonly reported in quartz grains from the boundary elsewhere. Shocked zircon had never been observed before. * Krogh and others used Uranium-Lead dating to study zircons from the K‚ÄìT boundary in Colorado, Haiti, and the Chicxulub crater. They found that the zircons first crystallized 545 million years ago, and experienced a loss of lead during an episode that occurred 65 million years ago. This loss of lead could have been caused by heat from the hypothesized impact event. The Western Interior Seaway of North America at its greatest extent, c. 75 million years ago 1994 * Smith and others concluded that the Late Cretaceous drop in sea levels constituted the most severe marine regression of the entire Mesozoic Era. * D'Hondt and others argued that an asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous would not have produced enough acid for acid rain to be a significant factor contributing to the mass extinction. * Weil argued that the hypothesis of acid rain occurring in the wake of an asteroid impact contributing the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary mass extinction was a poor explanation for the which taxa actually survived or perished. * Askin and others found no evidence for any \\"biotic upheaval\\" in the fossil pollen and spores of the latest Cretaceous of Antarctica. * Popsichal concluded that the extinction of many foraminifera at the end of the Cretaceous occurred abruptly rather than gradually. * A conference dedicated to the end-Cretaceous extinction event was held in Houston, Texas. During the conference several expert attendees embarked on a field trip to the Mexican Arroyo el Mimbral site to assess whether or not the deposit formed rapidly, as in the tsunami hypothesis or gradually as in the sedimentary slumping hypothesis. Personal accounts on which model was more widely supported among the attendees differ. 1995 * Hurlbert and Archibald argued that the statistical analyses used by Sheehan and others in 1991 were not precise enough to reliably conclude that the make- up of the Hell Creek dinosaur fauna did not change over time. They also argued that the quality of the Hell Creek fossil record was too poor to determine whether or not the extinction of the dinosaurs was gradual or sudden. * By the end of the year, 50 K‚ÄìT boundary sites with anomalously high iridium levels had been identified. * Peucker-Ehrenbrink and others studied osmium isotope ratios from sediments ranging in age from recent to 80 million years old. They found only the osmium at the K‚ÄìT boundary to preserve an anomalous extraterrestrial-like ratio. * N. Bhandari and others reported the discovery of the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary in the Deccan Traps. The Deccan Traps are a series of basalt layers released by intermittent volcanic activity across the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary. During the periods between eruptions, normal sediments accumulated in deposits called intertrappeans. The basalt deposits can be dated with paleomagnetism and radiometric dating, so the intertrappeans can be dated fairly precisely. Bhandari and the other researchers found the third intertrappean to have been laid down at the K‚ÄìT Boundary. This intertrappean proved highly significant because this layer alone among the traps contained elevated iridium levels, so the volcanic activity itself could not be the source of the iridium. Further, Intertrappean III preserves dinosaur eggshells, proving that they survived up to the very end of the Cretaceous. * May: Dewey McLean retired due to ill health. He attributed his medical problems to stress caused by persecution from Luis Alvarez, who McLean claimed had been trying to destroy his career ever since McLean first voiced opposition to the impact hypothesis back in the 1980s. * Peter Ward criticized the perennial hypothesis that dropping sea levels at the end of the Cretaceous contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs because there was no known explanation for how lower sea levels could lead to such an extinction. 1996 * Archibald argued that the withdrawal of shallow seas from Earth's continents during the Late Cretaceous reduced the size of and fragmented the coastal plain habitats preferred by large dinosaur species and that this fragmentation may have driven some taxa extinct. A fossil Inoceramus shell * D'Hondt and others reinterpreted the carbon isotope data Hsu and others had argued implied the existence of a \\"Strangelove Ocean\\" with no primary productivity at the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary boundary. This reinterpretation concluded that the data actually represented a cessation of carbon transport from the surface to deeper water at that time and that this cessation lasted up to three million years beyond the Cretaceous They also argued that the remains of Cretaceous foraminifera had been physically disturbed and redeposited in Paleocene sediments, creating an illusion of a more gradual extinction than had actually occurred. * Huber also argued that the remains of Cretaceous foraminifera had been physically disturbed and redeposited in Paleocene sediments, creating an illusion of a more gradual extinction than had actually occurred. * Macleod and others observed that inoceramid bivalves suffered a significant worldwide episode of extinctions during the mid-Maastrichtian, although not all at exactly the same time. * Marshall and Ward published a detailed examination of latest Cretaceous ammonite biostratigraphy at Zumaya, Spain. They tracked the survivorship of 28 different ammonite species. They found that of these 28, 6 went extinct significantly before the end of the Cretaceous, 12 survived up to the period's boundary with the Tertiary, and the rest may or may not have perished in between the other extinctions. * Anbar and others measured the iridium content of modern bodies of water. They found that the K‚ÄìT boundary preserved 1,000 times as much iridium as is present in all of the world's oceans combined. * Birger, Schmitz and Asaro re-examined volcanism as a potential source of elevated iridium levels in the rock record. They verified \\"that some types of explosive volcanism\\" can release significant quantities of iridium, but argued that levels of other elements in these volcanic ashes distinguish them from impact material. Despite confirming volcanism in general as a potential iridium source, Schmitz and Asaro disputed the validity of certain specific reports of volcanic iridium that had supposedly called the impact hypothesis into question. * Sharpton and others argued that the Chicxulub crater was actually about 300 km in diameter rather than about 170 km. According to James Lawrence Powell, if this estimate is correct, the Chicxulub crater is one of the largest impact structures in the inner solar system. * July: Officer and Page published their book, The Great Dinosaur Extinction Controversy. * The 20 paper anthology Cretaceous Mass Extinctions: Biotic and Environmental Changes was published. The volume was edited by Keller and Macleod who continued to argue that foraminifera were not victims of a catastrophic mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. Sea level over time during the Phanerozoic eon 1997 * Fastovsky and Sheehan argued that there was no evidence for the kind of habitat fragmentation Archibald hypothesized to occur with Late Cretaceous marine regression. * Ginsburg reported the results of a \\"blind test\\" of both sides in the controversy over whether or not foraminifera went extinct gradually or abruptly at the end of the Cretaceous. However, even this blind test proved inconclusive and was unable to settle the controversy between Keller and Smit. * Albert Hallam and Wignall observed that all five of Earth's mass extinctions were associated with worldwide drops in sea level. Hell Creek paleofauna * Pope and others estimated that the impact which formed the Chicxulub Cater would have ejected 200 billion tons of sulfur dioxide and water into the atmosphere. They argued that the world would have suffered \\"a decade of impact winter\\" in the impact's aftermath. 1998 * Lopez- Martinez and others noted the presence of sauropod and ornithopod tracks near the K‚ÄìT boundary in the Tremp Formation of northeastern Spain. The presence of tracks so close to the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary suggests that the dinosaur died out rapidly rather than gradually. * Sullivan argued that dinosaur biodiversity experienced a marked decline over the last ten million years of the Cretaceous Period. * Stromberg and others reported that fossil pollen from the Hell Creek Formation provided evidence for a gradual shift in the region's flora \\"from more open to more closed and moist habitats\\". 1999 * Norris and others concluded that the extinction of many foraminifera at the end of the Cretaceous was abrupt rather than gradual. 21st century =2000s= A modern member of the shark genus Chiloscyllium, which survived the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event 2000 * Hoganson found evidence for elasmobranch extinctions at the K‚ÄìT boundary. 2001 * Pearson and others published the results of their field work aimed at studying vertebrates near the K‚ÄìT boundary. Their findings were consistent with the impact hypothesis. 2002 * Pope argued that the amount of dust supposedly kicked up by the asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous had been overestimated by a factor of nearly one hundred and the idea that this dust blotted out the sun and halted photosynthesis was no longer a viable explanation for the extinction event at the end of the period. * Pearson and others published the results of their field work aimed at studying vertebrates near the K‚ÄìT boundary. Their findings were consistent with the impact hypothesis. = 2010s = 2010 * An international panel of researchers concluded that an impact best explained the extinction event and that Chicxulub was indeed the resulting crater. 2013 * Prior to 2013, the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction that resulted from the Chicxulub impact was commonly cited as having happened about 65 million years ago, but a 2013 paper by Renne et al. gave an updated value of 66 million years. 2016 * A drilling project into the Chicxulub peak ring confirmed that the peak ring comprised granite ejected within minutes from deep in the Earth (rather than usual seafloor rock), and evidence of colossal seawater movement directly afterwards (from layered sand deposits). Crucially, the cores also showed a near-complete absence of gypsum, the usual sea floor mineral in the region, which is sulfate-containing; this would have been vaporized and dispersed as an aerosol into the atmosphere, providing evidence of a probable link between the impact and a global scale of longer-term effects on the climate and food chain. 2019 * A study aiming to quantify the habitat of latest Cretaceous North American dinosaurs, based on data from fossil occurrences and climatic and environmental modelling, and evaluating its implications for inferring whether dinosaur diversity was in decline prior to the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, was published by Chiarenza et al. (2019). * A study on the drivers and tempo of biotic recovery after Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene mass extinction, as indicated by data from the Corral Bluffs section of the Denver Basin (Colorado, United States), is published by Lyson et al. (2019). 2020 *Hull et al. report data from marine microfossils, carbon cycle modeling and paleotemperature records showing that the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene Mass Extinction about 66 million years ago was mostly a result of a meteorite impact (the Chicxulub impactor) and not a result of volcanism. * In a study published by Chiarenza et al. (2020) the two main hypotheses for the mass extinction (the Daccan Traps and the Chicxulub impact) were evaluated using Earth System and Ecologial modelling, confirming that the asteroid impact was the main driver of this extinction while the volcanism might have boosted the recovery instead.

The boat has been in use by fishing communities since at least the 17th century,Clare Traditional Boat and Currach Project 2008, http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/heritage/pdfs/clare_traditional_boat_and_currach_project_2008.pdf mostly for catching salmon and cutting reeds. The gandelow is a flat-bottomed boat about 7 metres long constructed by local craftsmen following traditional designs. It has recently experienced a revival and is now in use for sport, exercise and recreational fishing. History The origins of the gandelow‚Äôs name are unknown - it may be connected with that of the Italian gondola ('small boat') or, possibly, be a version of the Viking name for their flat- bottomed boats.McInerney, Jim (2005) \\"The Gandelow: a Shannon Estuary Fishing Boat\\" A.K. Ilen Company Ltd, Most gandelows were around 7 metres (23 feet) along and were rowed by two or three fishermen whose main catch was salmon. The boats were also used for cutting thatching reeds and for transporting people and the occasional cow or sheep. In Limerick, some boats were used to take pilots out to the ocean-going vessels or acted as small Lighter (barge)s transporting goods to the docks. The boat's variations in form reflect the unique different conditions up and down the Shannon estuary. In Limerick, the fishing village was on Clancy Strand opposite King John's Castle. The story of the gandelow has been described in Jim McInerney's book \\"The Gandelow: a Shannon Estuary Fishing Boat\\" published in 2005. The fishermen of those times would no doubt be astonished to see that their working boat is now being built again, prized by the Limerick riverside community for its beauty and raced for entertainment and exercise. By the 1950s it was getting harder to find the long spruce boards needed for building the boats and so shorter boats of 21 feet, or even 18 feet long became more common. Eventually, gandelow building faded away as fish stocks declined and limits on fishing on the Shannon were applied. Construction Gandelow under construction at the Ilen School and Network for Wooden Boat Building, 2014 The 23-foot boats of the traditional Shannon type are specialised craft which evolved different forms in various parts of the estuary over the centuries. These variations enabled the fishermen to deal with the challenges of the river with its exceptional tidal range. The different forms are described in the book \\"Traditional Boats of Ireland\\" (2008). The gandelow has 'butterfly planks' at the stern and this design feature (seen in the photograph) differentiates it from the Dory which is superficially similar. Gandelow building requires the kind of long, clean planks that were available in Limerick's timber port - maybe that's one reason why gandelow building became popular there. Most fishing families had at least one member who had the skills and eye to be a boat-builder. These skills were handed down within the families where such expertise was a considerable asset. As a result, templates and plans were jealously guarded and so few records remain. The boat-builder's shed would be a modest affair - nothing like a modern workshop. Nevertheless, the boats were made with care and became handy craft which could last up to twenty years if maintained well. The construction techniques were simple and effective, the tools used minimal and a great deal of 'eye' was used to fair the lines. Each boat was therefore unique with parts shaped to fit the minor variations caused by the quality of wood available and whether the builder used any moulds, frames or templates (many did not). Gandelows are being built again in Limerick. Four were built at the Ilen School and Network for Wooden Boat Building in 2014. The build process was carefully documented and a book produced which serves as a record for future generations. Gandelows and gondolas In 2014, at the invitation of the mayor of Venice, four gandelows were taken there to take part in the annual Festa degli asparagi (Asparagus festival). This was also an opportunity to directly compare the gandelow with local Italian boats of a similar design (such as the 's'ciopon' - meaning 'big gun'- or a 'sandolo').The Venetian S'ciopon, a type of sandolo http://www.venipedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=S%27ciopon Indeed, when seen side by side, A gandelow among local boats in Venice (http://www.ilen.ie/wp- content/uploads/2015/10/Gandelow-Racing-Venice.jpg - photo Gary MacMahon, Ilen School, 2014) there were many similarities in design and methods of construction which lent some support to the theory, voiced annecdotally in Ireland, that the names gandelow and gondola were somehow connected. However, no conclusive evidence has been found yet.

Life Jan Baptist Bonnecroy was born in Antwerp as the son of the cloth merchant Willem Bonnecroy and Antonetta de la Forterie. He studied art from an early age but renounced an artistic career at the age of 20 to enter a Franciscans monastery in 1638. He renounced his religious calling, however, and was married by the year 1642. A Middelburg ship lying off Middelburg After he had become an orphan he was placed under guardianship. One of his guardians was the famous landscape painter Lucas van Uden. He entered into a contract of apprenticeship and was in 1644 enrolled as a pupil of Lucas van Uden. The next year he passed his master test and was registered as a painter in the records of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke. In 1658 he bought a house in Antwerp, which he resold in 1662.Franz Jozef Peter van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche Schilder-school, Part 1], Buschmann, 1883, pp. 1054‚Äì1055 He was still registered at the Antwerp Guild in 1665 but after that there is no trace of him in Antwerp. It is likely that he worked in Amsterdam and Brussels since he painted views of both of these cities.Jean Baptiste Bonnecroy at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He died after 1676 possibly in Brussels since a city view of Brussels by his hand shows Brussels in that year. Work Bonnecroy is best known for his large-scale panoramic views of cities. In addition, he also painted a number of marine views of sailing ships. View of Antwerp port He painted at least 4 views of Antwerp.Jan Baptist Bonnecroy at Balat The view dated 1658 was ordered for the Antwerp City Hall. He also made views of Amsterdam and Brussels. These views all show the cities from a distance and with a bird‚Äôs eye perspective. Bonnecroy relied on drawings of the principal buildings and city maps and his knowledge of perspective to create this illusion of looking at the cities from above.Expo: Brussel in vogelvlucht at Knack The View of Brussels now part of the collection of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium was originally the property of the Dukes of Arenberg who kept it in their castle in Heverlee.Gezicht op Brussel at the Koning Boudewijnstichting Bonnecroy also painted marine views. The National Maritime Museum in Greenwich holds two of his marine paintings, both showing views of Dutch ships sailing in front of a Dutch harbour. The paintings are in the Flemish Baroque tradition, and executed with liquid and ornamental rendering of the brushstrokes. The influence of Hendrik van Minderhout is apparent.A Middelburg Ship Lying off Middelburg at the National Maritime Museum Landscape with a castle Bonnecroy was also a skilled etcher. The British Museum holds seven of his etchings which were formerly attributed to his master Lucas van Uden.

(1781-1844) Helen D'Arcy Stewart (n√©e Cranstoun; 1765‚Äì1838) was Scottish poet and a noted Edinburgh society hostess of the late 18th and early 19th century, as wife to Dugald Stewart, an influential Scottish philosopher and mathematician best known for popularizing the Scottish Enlightenment. Biography Helen D'Arcy Stewart was born on 13 March 1765, and was the third daughter of the Hon. George Cranstoun, and sister of George Cranstoun Lord Corehouse, and of Jane Ann, later Countess Purgstall, both intimate friends of Sir Walter Scott. Her mother was Maria, daughter of Thomas Brisbane, of Brisbane in Ayrshire. As a girl she seems to have attracted notice by the charm of her manner and the brilliancy of her mind. She was devoted to poetry, and wrote verses which were praised by people of literary distinction who were strangers to her. It was said of her poems that they \\"must remind every friend who knew her of her graceful taste and sensibility, of her quick perception of humour, of her playful wit.\\" It was out of her poetry that her marriage to Dugald Stewart is said to have been due. One of her poems was shown by her cousin, Lord Lothian, to Mr. Stewart, who was at that time his private tutor. The philosopher was sufficiently engaged by the poem to make an acquaintance with Helen, leading to their marriage on 26 July 1790, the age of the bride being twenty-five, and that of the bridegroom thirty-seven. The marriage was a perfectly happy one on both sides. The young wife doted on her reserved philosopher husband. He, who had the highest opinion of his wife's judgement, submitted all his writings to her. She was his habitual and confidential companion during his studies, and he never considered a piece of his composition to be finished until she had reviewed it. He himself said that, although she did not probably understand the abstract points of his philosophy so well as he did himself, yet when he had once made out a truth into an intelligible shape, she helped him to illustrate it \\"by a play of fancy and of feeling which could only come from a woman's mind.\\" In character, she was free from the slightest tinge of pedantry; there was no display of learning in her conversation. In one of his letters to the Bishop of Llandaff, Lord Dudley says of her: \\"She has as much knowledge, understanding, and wit as would set up three foreign ladies as first-rate talkers in their respective drawing-rooms, but she is almost as desirous to conceal as they are to display their talents.\\" A woman endowed with such gifts and charm naturally attracted a large circle of devoted friends, and as the wife of Dugald Stewart, whose literary reputation, after his marriage, soon rose to the highest rank, she was able to make her house in Edinburgh the resort of all those who were best worth knowing in the Scottish metropolis when it was really a metropolis of intellectual power. Hers was the house to which strangers most eagerly sought introduction, and it has been said that, when at the zenith of her life, it may be doubted if a person departing from Scotland could have carried a stronger recommendation into the intellectual world of England or America than a letter of introduction from Mrs. Dugald Stewart. A sixteen-year-old John Ward, later 1st Earl of Dudley, stayed with the Stewart family for an extended period in 1797-8, and correspondence from Dudley to Helen Stewart is collected in Letters to \\"Ivy\\" From The First Earl of Dudley (1905). Helen Stewart died at Warriston House, Edinburgh, on 28 July 1838. Her character is summed up, in an obituary notice in the Edinburgh Evening Courant of 9 August 1838: \\"To the last she was remarkable for a winning gentleness of manner ‚Äî a meekness more impressive than austerity ‚Äî by which, during her whole life, she had exercised greater influence on those around her than others could do by an assumption of dignity.\\" Family Dugald Stewart and Helen had a son, George, who died in 1809, and a daughter Maria d'Arcy, who died unmarried in 1846. Works Little of Helen Stewart's work is published. Her poem The tears I shed must ever fall was noted by Robert Burns, who recommended it a \\"song of genius\\" and supplied the initial four lines for the final stanza. It, and others, are published in Johnson's Scots Musical Museum Vol iv, 1792. Her obituary in the Gentleman's Magazine states that \\"She holds a high place amongst the authors of Scottish song\\".

Interactive Entertainment. It adapts the plots of the first four films in the Jurassic Park franchise, and is part of a series of Lego-themed video games. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One on 12 June 2015 to coincide with the theatrical release of Jurassic World. An OS X port by Feral Interactive followed shortly thereafter, on 23 July. Lego Jurassic World was later released for Android and iOS on 31 March 2016. A Nintendo Switch version was later released on 17 September 2019. Gameplay Lego Jurassic World's gameplay is similar to previous Lego video games. Gameplay consists of the player solving puzzles. The game features 20 levels, with five levels based on each film. The levels are accessed through a free-roaming overworld area. The game incorporates a two-player cooperation mode. The game features more than 100 unlockable characters to play as, including more than 20 dinosaur species, such as Ankylosaurus, Stegosaurus, Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus. Mr. DNA, a cartoon character featured in the 1993 Jurassic Park film, is also an unlockable character. Throughout the game, Mr. DNA provides the player with hints; and with dinosaur trivia, as he did in the Jurassic Park video game for the Super NES. Human characters include Dr. Alan Grant, Ian Malcolm, and Owen Grady. Each character has a special ability. The utilization of each character's ability is required to progress through the game. Jurassic World producers Pat Crowley and Frank Marshall appear as unlockable characters, as well as the film's director, Colin Trevorrow. Steven Spielberg, who has acted as director and executive producer for films in the series, is also an unlockable character. The player can also create new human characters by travelling to either the Jurassic Park Visitor Center or the Jurassic World Innovation Center. Hybrid dinosaurs can also be created from various parts of dinosaurs that can be unlocked during the game's progression. Enemies include Compsognathus, Dilophosaurus and Velociraptor. The 3DS version excludes the free-roaming mode for a central hub instead, but is otherwise nearly identical to the home console versions of the game. The Android and iOS versions also use a main hub section to access levels; because of limitations on digital storage space, these versions feature fewer levels and fewer cutscenes than the home console versions, and the levels are also reduced in size. The iOS version supports use of iCloud and Game Center. Plot The game follows the storylines from the Jurassic Park films: Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park III and Jurassic World. However, the developers modified the storylines to fit the events into five levels per film. Notable scenes from each film have been recreated in the game. Serious scenes from the films, including characters' deaths, were replaced with humor for the video game as it was aimed at children (for example, after most scenes depicting a character being eaten by a dinosaur occur, the dinosaur will later on regurgitate the character unharmed). Development Lego Jurassic World was developed by TT Fusion. Voice clips were taken directly from characters in the series' first three films and were implemented into the game. Original music for the game was written by Rob Westwood, and was composed by Chad Seiter. \\"Journey to the Island\\", \\"T-Rex Rescue and Finale\\" and \\"Malcolm's Journey\\", three tracks written by composer John Williams for Jurassic Park and The Lost World: Jurassic Park, were also implemented into the game, along with music composed by Michael Giacchino for Jurassic World. The game was first teased when Plastic Man's Tyrannosaurus form appeared during the end credits of the 2014 video game, Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. The game was officially announced in January 2015. In March 2015, a trailer was released for the game. A second trailer was released on 14 May 2015, giving a release date of 12 June 2015, to coincide with the theatrical release of Jurassic World. =Audio= Many actors from Jurassic World provided new vocal footage for the game, including Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Nick Robinson, Ty Simpkins, Vincent D'Onofrio, Irrfan Khan, Omar Sy, BD Wong, Jake Johnson, and Lauren Lapkus. Comedian Jimmy Fallon, who had a cameo in the film, also provided his voice for the game's Jurassic World chapter and is also a playable character. Peter Stormare reprised his role as Dieter Stark from The Lost World: Jurassic Park, making him the only actor from the second or third films to contribute new lines. Reception According to review aggregator Metacritic, most versions of Lego Jurassic World received \\"Mixed or average reviews,\\" while the iOS version received \\"Generally favorable reviews.\\" Ebenezer Samuel of the New York Daily News noted the \\"largely simple and friendly\\" gameplay and puzzles, and wrote, \\"By and large, there's plenty to love in LEGO Jurassic World, despite a smattering of little bugs. TT Games doesn't reinvent with LEGO Jurassic World at all. But it does build a solid gaming experience that parents and kids can appreciate together.\\" Gieson Cacho of San Jose Mercury News criticized the game's camera angles, difficulty, and also noted that the game was too similar to previous Lego video games. Cacho enjoyed the game's playable dinosaurs, but also wrote, \\"Unfortunately, there are only a handful of moments where players control them.\\" Dave Rudden of IGN praised the PC version for its fast pacing and \\"fun puzzles\\". However, Rudden criticized the \\"frustrating\\" presence of Compsognathus in each chapter of the game and said \\"the overworld is a bit of a mess, especially when I had to explore the islands to find the entrance to a new level.\\" Matt Clapham of GamesRadar, who reviewed the PlayStation 4 version, enjoyed the game's playable dinosaur characters, but criticized the \\"occasionally patchy\\" quality of dialogue that was incorporated into the game from the first three films, saying it \\"stands out next to the freshly voiced extras.\\" Clapham also criticized the Compsognathus enemies; the artificial intelligence of the game's computer- controlled companion characters; and noted that the game is prone to crashing. Joe Juba of Game Informer, who reviewed the PlayStation 4 version, enjoyed the game's colorful graphics and its use of theme songs from the films, but also felt that the gameplay was too similar to previous Lego video games. Juba criticized the \\"annoying\\" Compsognathus enemies, and considered battles with other enemies to be \\"boring.\\" Juba also felt that the game's feature to play as dinosaurs took \\"too long to gain any steam.\\" Juba also criticized the game for technical glitches, and felt that the limited amount of audio from the first three films was \\"distracting and poorly used.\\" Juba concluded that, \\"Lego Jurassic World is a dull, occasionally frustrating experience with a lot of cute nods to the series for hardcore fans. That's as good as it gets.\\" Jeremy Signor of GameSpot reviewed the PlayStation 4 version, and wrote that it had \\"style and undeniable charm that will melt your cynical heart, but the boring things the game makes you do hamper the joy.\\" Signor wrote, \\"The problem is that you can't actually experiment with anything in any real sense. The different abilities are simply keys to unlock progress or secrets. You never get the chance to noodle around with the mechanics or improvise since there's always just one solution to every obstacle the game puts in your way.\\" Signor also criticized the audio from the original films, saying that it \\"wasn't mixed very well with the game audio, which sounds jarring next to the pristine, polished sounds and voices recorded for the game\\". Signor concluded that the game focused too much on \\"visual and thematic experience almost entirely while letting the actual gameplay languish. Jurassic Park in particular doesn't suit this design because flattening the mechanics removes all notions of tension from the game, an essential part of the film series.\\" Dave Letcavage of Nintendo Life, reviewing the Wii U version, wrote that the game \\"is exactly what we've come to expect of the LEGO series, with very few surprises. Thankfully, a herd of the missions are designed expertly, and they prove why such a prolific series has stayed relevant all these years. But there are also numerous missions that fall flat, relying too heavily on unneeded combat or working too many playable characters into the mix. The campaign is a bumpy ride to be sure, though it's nowhere near being classified a disaster.\\" Letcavage wrote that in certain levels, the \\"poor quality\\" of the audio clips from the original films \\"and their contrast with the music and sound effects make them hugely jarring\\". Letcavage also noted that the Wii U version did not run smoothly in comparison to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions. NF Magazine, which reviewed the Wii U version, wrote, \\"LEGO Jurassic World is as 'more of the same' as a game gets.\\" Official Xbox Magazine (UK) wrote about the Xbox One version: \\"Plenty of expense spared, we think.\\" Ron DelVillano of Nintendo Life criticized the 3DS version for its poor audio, and noted that its gameplay was too similar to previous Lego video games. DelVillano wrote that utilizing the system's 3D feature \\"ruins the entire experience. Jagged lines make themselves present, the once smooth visuals deteriorate, and the frame rate drops just enough to make you feel like you're playing at a slower speed. It's a disappointingly ugly experience.\\" DelVillano also wrote that, \\"Because each film is condensed into a certain number of stages, large portions of the plots are left out in order to make room for more action. What we're left with is a mash up of interactive scenes that are loosely strung together by cinematic sequences that don't fully explain what is going on around you.\\" Kimberly Keller of Nintendo World Report praised the 3DS version: \\"As amazing as it is that there has never been a Lego and dinosaur match-up before now, this game makes up for lost time.\\" However, she noted slow loading times between levels, the \\"annoying\\" Compsognathus enemies, and felt that the game was, \\"Not too unique compared to previous Lego titles.\\" Rob Rich of Gamezebo reviewed the mobile version and praised the large amount of unlockable content and the \\"cleverly implemented\\" skills of its characters. However, Rich criticized the mobile version for its hub feature, as well as its exclusion of certain cutscenes and levels from the home console versions; Rich also noted that most of the game's levels were smaller in comparison, and concluded, \\"LEGO Jurassic World on mobile is a bit disappointing, but that's because I'm so fond of the original release and can spot what's missing. Honestly, it's no wonder some content was cut when you consider how much less digital storage space the average mobile device has when compared to a console or PC. Still, as with the earlier releases it shows plenty of reverence for the movies, and is easily the best mobile LEGO game I've played to date.\\" Ray Willmott of Pocket Gamer wrote that the iOS version was \\"good-old fashioned entertainment at its finest,\\" writing that \\"Traveller's Tales has done a remarkable job of making everything feel refreshing, yet authentic.\\" Willmott wrote that the touch controls \\"occasionally aren't receptive to your gestures - particularly for jumping. But the experience is generally fluid throughout.\\" Willmott noted the sound effects as being \\"a bit tinny\\", but praised the soundtrack and wrote that the graphics \\"occasionally sparkle and dazzle on the small screen.\\" Willmott concluded that while the game was not flawless, it was \\"a pleasure to play.\\" Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade reviewed the iOS version, and noted the game's new vocal clips as well as the clips of \\"questionable quality grabbed from the movies,\\" stating that \\"the two styles of voice samples certainly don't mesh well at all.\\" However, Musgrave praised the game's support of iCloud and Game Center, as well as its diverse iOS-specific control settings, stating, \\"While I may rag on these games for the way they pull their designs back from the console versions, it's nice to see iOS- specific features get proper attention.\\" Musgrave concluded that the game would appeal most to fans of Lego video games and of the Jurassic Park series. =Sales= In the UK, Lego Jurassic World became the top-selling game for the week ending 20 June 2015. Lego Jurassic World became the best-selling game of July 2015, with the Xbox 360 version selling the most copies. In the UK, Lego Jurassic World took the top-selling spot again for two consecutive weeks during August 2015. On 13 October 2015, Warner Bros. revealed that the game had sold 4 million copies.

Interactive Entertainment, for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Macintosh, and Microsoft Windows. It is the spin-off to Lego Marvel Super Heroes and the second installment of the Lego Marvel franchise. The game primarily follows the plots of both The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron, as well as their Marvel Cinematic Universe films Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The game features characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as characters from comic books. Characters include Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Thor, Ultron, Loki, Winter Soldier, Falcon, Vision, and War Machine, as well as some lesser known characters such as Devil Dinosaur and Fin Fang Foom. It includes the characters of the Avengers team along with many others. The game was released on 26 January 2016. Gameplay The gameplay is similar to Lego's long-running series of franchise video games, with a focus on puzzle-solving interspersed with action. Players have to solve puzzles spread across the game environment in order to progress through levels. While action and fighting are featured liberally throughout the game, it is kept very child-friendly as per Lego custom. The game features New York City as the main large open-world hub, but also, for the first time, includes a dozen other movie significant areas players can travel to, including Asgard, Malibu, South Africa, The Helicarrier, the Bartons' farm, Washington D.C., and Sokovia. These hubs also feature heavy playability, with hundreds of side quests and bonus levels such as rescuing citizens in trouble, races, and more. The main story actually takes up a fairly small fraction of the game's total \\"completion\\". Whilst the game's story is predominantly focused on the first two Avengers films, and there are single levels based on Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. =Characters= The game features over two hundred playable characters, including some characters (but not all) returning from the previous game. The heroes are drawn not just from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the comics as well. Director Arthur Parsons stated: \\"It's a celebration of everything about the Avengers. Comic books, movies, cartoons. It's everything you love about the Avengers in video games\\". Confirmed additional characters include Kamala Khan as Ms. Marvel, Sam Wilson's Captain America appearance, America Chavez, Jane Foster's Thor form, Wiccan, and Speed. Every two characters have their own unique team-up abilities. There are even separate ones for what character is triggering the attack, meaning nearly 800 team-up moves. Development =Audio= Unlike Lego Marvel Super Heroes, which used original voice acting, Lego Marvel's Avengers utilizes audio from the six films being adapted for the game, including voice and music, similar to Lego The Lord of the Rings, The Lego Movie Videogame, Lego The Hobbit, and Lego Jurassic World. The game utilizes the archive audios from the actors in the films. However, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Ashley Johnson, Hayley Atwell, Michael Pe√±a, and Ming-Na Wen reprise their respective roles from the films and TV shows, and Marvel Comics co-creator Stan Lee returned to voice himself. Robbie Daymond voices A-Bomb.Robbie Daymond Talks Sailor Moon and More Lou Ferrigno voices himself and Greg Miller voiced Aldrich Killian. =Downloadable content= Free PlayStation timed exclusive downloadable content was announced. This included a character pack and a level based on Ant-Man, which was released on April 6, 2016, and a Captain America: Civil War character pack that was released at launch. A season pass was also available during launch, which gave players exclusive access to the \\"Explorers Pack\\", story levels and over 40 additional playable characters. These story levels were based on the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. television series as well as levels focused on the comic versions of Black Panther, the Masters of Evil, Captain Marvel, and Doctor Strange. A Spider-Man character pack was also released on May 24, 2016, which saw the Civil War version of the character as a playable character. Reception Upon its release, Lego Marvel's Avengers received mixed reviews. It has a score of 71/100 on Metacritic. Game Informer Andrew Reiner gave the game 7.75 out of 10. IGN awarded it a score of 6.7 out of 10, saying \\"LEGO Marvel's Avengers is great fun, but unfortunately restricted by sticking to the Marvel Cinematic Universe\\". Destructoid awarded it a score of 6 out of 10, saying \\"it's a fun mindless romp through a couple of interesting setpieces, but not a whole lot more than that when it comes down to it\\". PlayStation LifeStyle awarded it 7.5 out of 10, saying \\"some technical hiccups and the occasional unclear objective can hamper your progress, but these can all be overcome in a game that exudes a fun-loving attitude throughout\\". GameSpot awarded it a score of 7.0 out of 10, saying \\"if you've played a Lego game in recent years then you'll know what to expect: another familiar and fun adventure that you can enjoy with your kids\\". Hardcore Gamer awarded it a score of 3 out of 5, saying \\"while a decent action-adventure title, Avengers does little to innovate or set itself apart from a vast library of superior Lego games\\". PC Gamer awarded it a score of 52%, calling it \\"a half-hearted recreation of some fun movies, with almost nothing to offer over its predecessor\\".

Brother Russell House in Limerick is named after him in honour of his work with helping Limerick's homeless in the 1970s. Younger years Russell was educated at the Christian Brothers School in Charleville to which he either walked of travelled in a donkey buggy (with six or seven others) each day, a distance of three and a half miles each way. War years He joined the Irish army at the start of World War 2 in 1939 and served in the First cycle squadron being stationed in Collins Barracks in Cork, Fermoy, Foynes, Listowel and Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick. He was well known and popular as a comedian in the southern command entertainment group. At the end of the emergency he was discharged from the Army in 1943. Religious years In 1945 he joined the congregation of the Alexian Brothers in Warrenpoint Co Down in September 1945. He received the habit on the feast of St Alexius 17 July 1948. Transferred to the Novitiate of the Alexian Order in Cobh, Co. Cork in 1948 he helped establishment of the foundation of the Novitiate House there. He then was transferred to the Alexian Monastery in Moston cemetery in (the United Kingdom where he spent the next three years burying the dead. He was transferred to the Alexian Monastery, Henri Chappelle in Belgium in 1954 where he severed on the nursing staff for three years. It was there he served on the nursing staff for three years. It was in Belgium that he started writing poetry and sent it regularly to the Limerick Leader and later to the Limerick Weekly Echo. In 1961 he returned to Ireland as vocational Promoter of the Alexian Brothers and spent four years travelling all over Ireland, visiting schools and seeking out postulants for the order. In 1965 he transferred back to Manchester where he served on the Nursing Staff of St. Mary's Alexian Nursing Home for Geriatric male patients. In 1968 Brother Stephen was attached to the Morning Star hostel for homeless men, which is under the auspices of the legion of Mary in Manchester. It was here he worked for the homeless and destitute and in 1973 volunteered with Bro. Anthony Ferrie to fulfil the request by the then Dr. Murphy, Bishop of Limerick, to help in the continuity of staffing the Simon Community Hostel at Charlotte Quay Limerick which had been established some three to four years previously. He finally returned to Ireland with Brother Anthony Ferrie to take over the management and supervision of the Simon Community hostel at Charlotte Quay limerick which had been established some three to four years previously. Unknown to most of his friends and colleagues Brother Stephen's health had been deteriorating for some years and he died on 11 May 1975. Poetry His first book of poems \\"There but for the Grace of God.\\" was published in 1972 and Brother Russell donated the entire proceeds of its sale to the Simon Community Building fund. \\"Poems and Parodies of Brother Stephen\\" published in 1974 by Oriel Press Brother Russell House He did not live to see the realisation of his dream for which he had laboured so hard the provision of a suitable and creditable Simon Centre for Limerick City. To the credit of his many friends and the sympathetic Officers of the Mid-Western Board such a centre eventually materialised and fittingly was named after him, The Brother Stephen Russell Home in Limerick. A labour of love and dedication to this unselfish character who was ever mindful of his conversion and has as his oft timed quote \\"There but for the grace of God go I.\\" He is buried with his fellow Brothers in Christ in the cemetery attached to Alexian Brothers in Warrenpoint, County Down. On 29 November 2013, the sod was turned on the redevelopment of Brother Russell House. The old building was no longer fit for purpose and did not match the basic needs for dignity and privacy. In less than one year the new facility opened and capacity at the house increased from 26 to 33 beds. Each of the men have their own ensuite room and now have a home of their own for life. This new development was made possible through funding from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and the generosity of the JP McManus Benevolent Fund.

Career Salazar, waving the Venezuelan flag following the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt = Presidential security = When Hugo Ch√°vez took office in early 1999, Salazar was among the most prestigious, young officers chosen to serve as one Ch√°vez's honor guards. Salazar then not only provided security for Ch√°vez, but was also his personal assistant. Following the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt, Ch√°vez recognized Salazar as one of his defenders. Following his experiences during the coup attempt in 2002, Salazar then decided to join Venezuela's special forces. After a helicopter demonstration performed by Salazar at the Parade of the Navy in 2006, Ch√°vez once again recognized Salazar and asked Jesse Chac√≥n, then Minister of Interior and Justice, to place Salazar on his security details for a second time at Miraflores Palace. Salazar was then reassigned and provided security for Ch√°vez until 2013, when Ch√°vez died of cancer. After Ch√°vez's death, Salazar became the head of the security detail for then President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello until 2014. = Defection to the United States =  Assistance of the DEA  In December 2014, Salazar defected to the United States after communicating with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration for about two months about Diosdado Cabello's alleged involvement with international drug trade. Salazar was then placed in witness protection, fleeing to the United States with assistance of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Special Operations Division after cooperation with the administration and providing possible details on Cabello's involvement with international drug trade. Salazar claims that Cabello is the leader of the Cartel of the Suns, an alleged military drug trafficking organization in Venezuela. Salazar stated that he saw Cabello give orders on transporting tons of cocaine. The shipments of drugs were reportedly sent from FARC in Colombia and shipped to the United States and Europe, with the possible assistance of Cuba. The alleged international drug operation had possibly involved senior members of Venezuela's government as well, such as Tarek El Aissami and Jos√© David Cabello, Diosdado's brother.  Death of Hugo Ch√°vez  After Salazar defected to the United States, he also said that the date that Hugo Ch√°vez was to have allegedly died according to the Venezuelan government was wrong.

Current lab-scale mass spectrometers however, usually weigh hundreds of pounds and can cost on the range from thousands to millions of dollars. One purpose of producing MMS is for in situ analysis. This in situ analysis can lead to much simpler mass spectrometer operation such that non-technical personnel like physicians at the bedside, firefighters in a burning factory, food safety inspectors in a warehouse, or airport security at airport checkpoints, etc. can analyze samples themselves saving the time, effort, and cost of having the sample run by a trained MS technician offsite. Although, reducing the size of MS can lead to a poorer performance of the instrument versus current analytical laboratory standards, MMS is designed to maintain sufficient resolutions, detection limits, accuracy, and especially the capability of automatic operation. These features are necessary for the specific in-situ applications of MMS mentioned above. Coupling and ionization in miniature mass spectrometer Microfluidic Chip iX-factory In typical mass spectrometry, MS is coupled with separation tools like gas chromatography, liquid chromatography or electrophoresis to reduce the effect of the matrix or background and improve the selectivity especially when the analytes are widely different in concentration. Sample preparation including sample collection, extraction, pre-separation increases the size of the mass analysis system and adds time and sophistication to the analysis. A lot of contribution promotes miniaturizing devices and simplifying the operations. A micro-GC has been implemented to fit to a portable MS system. Besides microfluidics is a competent candidate for MMS and automating sample preparation. In this technique, most of the steps for sample preparation are staged similarly with laboratory systems, but miniature chip-based devices are used with low consumption of sample and solvents. One way to circumvent classical, lab-based sample introduction systems is the use of ambient ionization as it does not require mechanical or electrical coupling to a MMS and can generate ions in the open atmosphere without prior sample preparation. Different ambient ionization methods, including low-temperature plasma, paper spray, and extraction spray, have been demonstrated to be highly compatible with MMS. Without separation coupling, the basic building blocks in MMS, which are similar in composition with the conventional laboratory counterpart, are sample inlet, ionization source, mass analyzers, detector, vacuum system, instrument control and data acquisition system. Three most important components in MMS contributing to miniaturization are mass analyzer, vacuum system and electronics control system. Reducing the size of any components is beneficial to the miniaturization. However, it is noticeable that minimizing the analyzer‚Äôs size can greatly enhance the miniaturization of the other components especially the vacuum system because the analyzer is the pressure deciding factor for MS analysis and pressure interface fabrication.  Miniature mass analyzer  Ion mobility spectrometer for trace detection of explosives and other dangerous chemicals. Smaller mass analyzers require smaller control system to generate adequate electric field and magnetic field strength, which are two fundamental fields separating ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. Because a compact circuit can generate a high electric field, decreasing the size of the voltage-generating system does not significantly affect to the miniaturization of time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF) and electric sectors which use only the electric field to separate ions. In principle, the electromagnetic field mainly depends on the shape of the mass analyzers. As a result, a smaller magnet fitting with small size MS reduces the system weight significantly. In practice, when reducing the size, the geometries of mass analyzer are distorted. For example, smaller volume in ion trap leads to lower trapping capacity and therefore results in a loss of resolution and sensitivity. However, by utilizing tandem MS resolution and selectivity can be greatly enhanced in complex mixtures. In general, beam- type mass analyzers, such as TOF and sector mass analyzers, are much larger than ion trap type such as Paul trap, Penning trap or Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR). Additionally, ion trap mass analyzers can be used to perform multistage MS/MS in a single device. As a result, ion traps are received dominant attention for building a MMS. = Miniature time of flight = Some researchers are successful in designing a series of miniature TOF mass analyzers. Cotter at Johns Hopkins University used a pulsed extraction in linear time of flight mass analyzer and the ions are accelerated to with higher energy of 12 keV to enable detection of high- mass. The group achieved resolutions of 1/1200 and 1/600 at m/z 4500 and 12000 respectively. This mini analyzer can measure 66k Da proteins, mixtures of oligonucleotides, and biological spores. Verbeck at University of North Texas, created a mini-TOF based on reflectron TOF with a microelectromechanical system technology. To overcome the low resolution of short flight tube, the effective ion travelling path length is extended by moving ions back and forth in periods of time. The system used a 5-cm endcap reflectron TOF with higher- order kinetic energy focusing to analyze the ions with m/z exceeding 60,000. Ecelberger, a senior professional staff scientist in the Sensor Science Group of the Research and Technology Development Center at APL also developed a suitcase TOF incorporated with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MALDI. The suitcase TOF was tested by scientists from U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command. The samples are biological toxins and chemical agents with the mass range from a few hundred daltons to over 60 kDa. The Suitcase TOF was referenced with a commercial TOFMS for the same experiments. Both instruments can detect all but a few compounds with very encouraging results. Because a commercial TOFMS uses a higher voltage pulsed extraction with longer flight tube with other optimized conditions, it generally has better sensitivity and resolution than a suitcase TOF. However, in the case of very high mass compounds, the suitcase TOF shows as good resolution and sensitivity as the commercial TOF. The suitcase TOF was also tested with a series of chemical weapons agents. Every compound tested was detected at levels comparable to standard analytical techniques for these agents. = Miniature sector = Several miniature double-focusing mass analyzers have been fabricated. A non-scanning Mattauch‚ÄìHerzog geometry sector was developed using new materials to construct a lighter magnet. Under the collaboration of University of Minnesota and Universidad de Costa Rica, a miniature double- focusing sector was produced under sophisticated technique of conventional machining methods and thin film patterning to overcome the distortion of the electric-magnetic fields due to small size. The MMS can reach a detection limit close to 10 ppm, a dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude and a mass range up to 103 Da. The mass analyzer overall sizes 3.5cmx6cmx7.5 cm and it weighs 0.8 kg and consumes 2.5 W. = Miniature linear quadrupole mass filter = The linear quadrupole mass filter or quadrupole mass analyzer is one of the most popular mass analyzer. The mini-quadrupole has been used as a single analyzer or in arrays of identical mass analyzers. The quadrupole array has rods of 0.5mm radius and 10mm long while another one with rods of 1mm radius and 25mm long. These mini quadrupole were developed and characterized at a radio frequency (RF) higher than 11 MHz. Volatile organic compounds were ionized by electron ionization and were characterized with unit resolution. Micromachining was applied to produce a much smaller V-groove quadrupole. = Miniature ion trap mass analyzer = Ion traps include quadrupole ion traps or Paul trap, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance or Penning trap and newly developed orbitrap. However, Paul trap receives a great focus from researchers for a MMS because of its distinct advantages over other mass analyzers for building MMS. One of the benefits is that ion traps can work at much higher pressures than beam type mass analyzers and can be simplified with different geometry for the ease of fabrication. For example, a miniature quadrupole ion trap mass analyzers, such as cylindrical ion trap, linear ion trap, rectilinear ion trap), can operate at several mTorr in contrast to 10‚àí5 Torr or less for other analyzers and it is able to perform MS/MS in a single device with minimum size of electronics system. Nevertheless, as the size gets smaller, it is hard to maintain the electric field shape and precise configuration and will negatively affect ion motion. The goal is to make the trap smaller without losing ion capacity. Tridion-9 mass spectrometer with toroidal ion trap is designed with a doughnut-shaped volume that can hold up to 400 times more ions. The outstanding result is achieved as the radius is reduced to one-fifth of a conventional laboratory ion trap while maintaining the ion capacity.  Miniature vacuum system  Pressure in mass spectrometer The purpose of using the vacuum is to eliminate background signal and avoid intermolecular collision events, therefore, providing a long mean free path for the ions. The vacuum system, including the vacuum pumps and the vacuum manifold with its various interfaces, is often the heaviest part and consumes the most power in a mass spectrometer. In the case of TOF, if the length of drift region is decreased, the pressure inside region can be operated at higher value because the free collision region is still maintained for a short traveling distance of the ions. As a result, the vacuum system requires less power to run the system. For a trap-type mass analyzer, because the ions are trapped in the device for long periods and the accumulated trajectory length is much longer than the size of the mass analyzer, the size reduction of the mass analyzer may not directly affect the adequate operating pressure. Miniature rough-turbo pump configurations similar to lab-scale instruments have been developed to be compatible with MMS. For high-vacuum pumping, turbomolecular pumps are also upgraded. A Thermo Fisher Orbitrap used three turbo pumps in LC-MS modes to achieve a vacuum below 10‚àí10 torr. Recently, a turbo pump from Creare, Inc.TM weighs only 500g and needs below 18 W power to run. The pump can provide the ultimate vacuum below 10‚àí8 torr, which is much lower than the operating pressure necessary for a MMS. Turbomolecular pump  The leading research groups, producers and applications One of the leading groups in academy for creating ion-trap MMS is Prof. Graham Cooks with his associate Professor Zheng Ouyang at Purdue University. They have built a series of mini mass spectrometer based on quadrupole ion trap called Mini 10, Mini 11, Mini 12. The group used Mini 10 mass spectrometer weighing 10 kg to analyze proteins, peptides and alkaloids in complex plant materials with electrospray ionization ESI and paperspray ionization. The group used low radio frequency of resonant ion ejection to increase mass range up to 17,000 Da proteins. For interfacing ESI source with MMS, a 10 cm stainless steel capillary was fabricated to transfer the ions directly into the vacuum manifold. The resulting high pressure of 20 mTorr, which is several orders of magnitude higher than that used in lab-scale mass spectrometers is compensated by using the pressure-tolerant rectilinear ion trap. One of the key component of this MMS is the commercial turbo-bump and the MS can be operated at 10‚àí3 torr. To overcome the problem of continuous sample introduction because of the small size of the pump, the group developed a technique called discontinuous atmospheric pressure introduction (DAPI). This technique performs direct chemical analysis without sample pretreatment and enables the coupling of miniature mass spectrometers to atmospheric pressure ionization sources, including ESI, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and various ambient ionization sources. The ions are transferred from ionization source and hold at a punch-valve and injected to MS periodically. The performance of a hand-held Mini-10 mass spectrometer was upgraded with negative ion mode for detecting explosive compounds and hazardous materials at the picogram level, which is highly applicable for airport luggage checking. The 8.5 kg Mini- 11 and 25 kg Mini-12 can produce resolution mass spectra up to m/z 600, a range that makes it useful for studying metabolites, lipids, and other small molecules. The group also developed and incorporated a digital microfluidic platform to the MMS with the application to extract and quantify drugs in urine. Mini 12 can perform MS5 and analyze directly such complex samples as whole blood, untreated food, and environmental samples, without sample preparation or chromatographic separation. Miniature mass spectrometer systems 1st Detect introduced the MMS 1000 which is a cylindrical ion-trap mass spectrometer with MS/MS capability. Some characteristics are advertised as wide mass range (35-450 Da), high resolution (<0.5 Da FWHM), fast analysis time (>=0.5s). The inlet flow rate can be high ‚Äì up to 600ml/min with no external pumps or carrier gases. The MMS 1000 is incorporated with a non- cryogenic pre-concentrator. This coupling enhances the sensitivity up to 10^5 with a fast speed of 30s. 1st Detect's miniaturized mass spectrometers are used in a range of applications, including homeland security, military, breath analysis, leak detection, environmental and industrial quality control. The MMS 1000 was originally designed for NASA, for the purpose of monitoring air quality on the International Space Station. 908 Devices introduced a handheld mass spectrometer utilizing high-pressure mass spectrometry M908 weighing 2 kg with solid, liquid, gas multi-phase detector. On the other hand, Microsaic Systems in Surrey, United Kingdom develops single quadrupole mass spectrometer called 3500 and 4000 MiD. These mass analyzers are used for supporting the pharmaceutical process chemistry. Several other MMS instruments have been also fabricated using ion trap mass analyzers, including Tridion-9 GCMS from TorionInc, now part of Perkin Elmer (AmericanFork, Utah), GC/QIT from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Chemsense 600 from Griffin Analytical Technology LLC. (West Lafayette, Indiana). Another example is Girgui at Harvard University, who built a MMS based on existing underwater mass spectrometers (UMS) that can operate underwater to study the influence of microbes on the methane and hydrogen content of the ocean. He worked with a mechanical engineer to package a commercial quadrupole mass analyzer from Stanford Research Systems, a Pfeiffer HiPace80 turbopump, and a custom gas extractor into a 25 cm √ó 90 cm cylinder. Total cost is about $15,000. The Analytical Instrumentation Research Institute in Korea also developed a palm-portable mass spectrometer. The size and weight is reduced to 1.54 l and 1.48 kg respectively, and it used 5 W power only. The PPMS is based on four parallel disk ion traps, a small ion getter pump and a micro-computer. The PPM can perform the scan ion mass of up to m/z 300 and detect the ppm concentration of organic gases diluted in the air. The Harsh-Environment Mass Spectrometry Society is holding a biannual workshop that focuses on in-situ mass spectrometry in extreme environments, such as in the deep ocean, volcano crater, or outer space require high reliability, autonomous or remote operation, ruggedness with minimum size, weight, and power. The archives of the workshop include ~100 presentations focusing on the design and application of miniature mass spectrometers. For example, In 8th Harsh Environment Mass Spectrometry Workshop, a group of scientists presented their study about utilization of lightweight MS based instrumentation and small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAV platforms for in-situ volcanic plume analysis in Turrialba and Arenal volcanoes (Costa Rica). Mini mass spectrometers relying on miniature 18 mm rods transpector quadrupole for mTorr pressure operation, a miniature turbo molecular drag pump and assets like small, multi-parameter battery powered sensor suite MiniGas embedded with micro PC control system, and telemetry system were integrated in an aircraft to acquire 4D image of an erupting volcanic plume.

He also spent one semester in his sophomore year at Benicia High School in Benicia, California, but returned to Hogan. He had surgery to repair a hernia in 2008, and did not play baseball. After attending Diablo Valley College in 2008, he transferred to Napa Valley College in 2009, and pitched for their baseball team. He set a school record with 110 strikeouts in innings pitched. Cravy was named the Bay Valley Conference's Most Valuable Player and a Community College Baseball All-American. Professional career =Milwaukee Brewers= The Milwaukee Brewers selected Cravy in the 17th round of the 2009 MLB Draft. He signed with the Brewers, receiving a $75,000 signing bonus. He began his professional career with the Arizona Brewers of the Rookie-level Arizona League in 2009, and pitched for the Helena Brewers of the Rookie-level Pioneer League in 2010. After starting the 2011 season with the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers of the Class A Midwest League, where he struggled with a 5.75 earned run average (ERA). The Brewers demoted him to Helena. Cravy returned to Wisconsin for the 2012 season, and he responded with a 3.38 ERA. In 2013, Cravy pitched for the Brevard County Manatees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, and he had a 4-2 win‚Äìloss record with a 2.04 ERA in innings pitched. After the 2013 regular season, the Brewers assigned Cravy to the Surprise Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League. He began the 2014 season with the Huntsville Stars of the Class AA Southern League, and started the league's All-Star Game for the Northern Division. After pitching to an 8-1 record and a 1.72 ERA with Huntsville, the Brewers promoted Cravy to the Nashville Sounds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL). In his first game with the Sounds, he strained his left oblique muscle, and missed the remainder of the 2014 regular season. Cravy began the 2015 season with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the PCL. The Brewers added him to their 40-man roster and promoted to the major leagues on May 31.http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/305631721.html He was optioned back to Colorado Springs on June 3. Spending spring training with the Brewers major league team, Cravy was the last player cut in spring training, the organization opting to send him to Class AAA Colorado Springs Sky Sox. He was called up to the active roster on April 2, 2016, when Matt Garza was put on the DL. The Brewers put Cravy in to more of a relieving role in 2016, and he appeared in 20 games. An \\"on-the-bubble\\" player heading in to 2017, Cravy pitched around a 2.00 ERA in spring training and again was the final player cut, leading him to harshly criticize the Brewers management, saying that he may not report to the minor leagues but instead go to \\"a 9 to 5 job where I get treated like a human.\\" Cravy also was a returning roster member, which made getting cut for the second straight year harder. He also took shots at the Brewers' management and general manager David Stearns, saying, \\"It says a lot about the integrity, or lack thereof, of the guys running the show.\\" He elected free agency on November 6, 2017. =York Revolution= On May 11, 2018, Cravy signed with the York Revolution of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.

Rockman published by Oxford University Press. Work Strings Attached and Stitched with Its Color, 2008-2013 Getting There, 2014 Kj√∏k specializes in painting, drawing and performance with a focus on the nude figure. New York art critic Meghan Dailey describes her core themes as \\"the body, its limits and the tension between its strength and its vulnerability.\\" In contrast to other artists who portray the nude at rest, Kj√∏k's bodies are usually in constant motion. This dynamic quality springs from her unique, highly athletic, immersive artistic technique. Her work begins in her studio, with she and her models engaging in an acrobatic process, \\"which incorporates picture taking, laborious posing and performance, cutting, collaging, rearranging and finally meditative reassemblage through drawing and painting...\\" Kj√∏k, a marathoner, approaches large-scale wall drawings as an \\"extreme sport\\". Of her 2009 solo-exhibit at Kunsthaus Tacheles, it was reported; \\"The wall work in Berlin was made in one week, during which Sol Kj√∏k lived in the gallery and worked virtually around the clock for seven intense consecutive days.\\"Ida Svingen Mo,\\"Analog Amour\\" translated from Norwegian SNITT: Magasin for visuell kommunikasjon, No. 6, 2009 About the same exhibit, Meghan Dailey wrote, \\"For much of that period, she is alone (solitude being the optimal condition for maximum concentration), eating and sleeping very little. In the course of working so intensely, notions of the self and of time collapse, until mentally and physically, Kj√∏k reaches a heightened state in which she feels a part of the piece.\\"Meghan Dailey, \\" Always Somebody Moving\\" in exhibition catalogue: Entre Sol et Ciel, Berlin: Art House Tacheles, 2009 Kj√∏k has completed \\"wall drawing as extreme sport\\" rounds in four countries.Showing Bodies in Motion, Hallandsposten, July 4, 2008 Although highly physical in both its subject and execution, Kj√∏k's art also incorporates many spiritual themes. Of the paradoxically corporeal and spiritual quality of her work, Noel Kelly (curator) wrote \\"There is no doubt that these are sexual figures, However, the sometimes contorted physiognomy and physicality of the figures speaks of the sublime; a rapture wherein strength, tenderness, vigour and tempestuous urgency portray the essence of the human state.\\"Noel Kelly Book of Swells Exhibition Catalogue. Laholm, Sweden: Teckningsmuseet -The Nordic Museum of Drawing, 2008 Jason Franz of Xavier University echoed this, saying \\"Ms. Kj√∏k writes of love, but her images are not necessarily sexual; at least no more than any other human image. No, if they are born of love, and therefore evoke love, it is of a higher order.\\" Kj√∏k herself acknowledges this duality in her artist's statement, saying \\"I used to think that monastic seclusion at a safe distance from my body was the way to knowledge. Now I am convinced that human beings are clothed in flesh for a reason: The path is through the skin. Opting for either Dionysus or Apollo is choosing the easy way out; the challenge is to maintain the balance between the two.\\" Despite these claims of a spiritual vision, some have found her work shockingly sensual with one writer describing her figures as \\"a cross between the androgynous representatives of some future race and the randy hippies of Alex Comfort's Joy of Sex\\". Reception Kj√∏k's work has received numerous accolades from critics. The prominent American critic Donald Kuspit praised her, saying, \\"Sol Kjok's figures ‚Äì male and female nudes ‚Äì are exquisitely drawn, often down to the least detail of their muscular flesh and expressive faces, indicating that she is not only a master draftsperson but a student of the human condition.\\" [‚Ä¶] \\"Certain passages of Swirling are sheer linear ecstasy ‚Äì Kj√∏k seems to delight in the act of drawing itself, not simply in describing the figure.\\" Push and Pull, 2013 New York Times art critic D. Dominick Lombardi wrote admiringly, \\"Sol Kj√∏k's art is playful and energetic.... Then there is a universal strength; a pleasure, a movement in her art that is clear and profound. It is obvious if you spend any time with her creations: Kj√∏k loves what she is doing. A feeling that emanates through every line, every form, every expression she records with obsessive precision...\\" Swedish writer Britte Montigny said, \\"It is expertly done. So dazzlingly accomplished that you all but miss the fact that Sol Kj√∏k's work also holds existential questions with a full range of feelings, spanning from safety-seeking anxiety and fear, to protective love and joy of life.\\" Britte Montigny,\\"Equilibristic Technique and Acrobatics\\" translated from Swedish Hallandsposten August 12, 2008 In NYArts, Helmer L√•ng wrote \\"This makes for a kind of conceptual art where the artist directs the action, in such a way that the result reads both dramatic and mystifying. The viewer constantly feels that there is much more to this than a simple juggling with the organic forms of the human body; there are also symbolic accents and even a philosophy of life.\\" Selected exhibitions =Solo exhibitions= Waiting for the Sun, 2008 * 2013 A Red Song in the Night.

Nye is a Professor Emerita at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater for the Philosophy and Religious Studies Department and an active member of the Women's Studies Department. In 1992, Nye received the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Award for Outstanding Research. Life and career Andrea Nye was born on October 22, 1939, in Philadelphia to attorney Hamilton Connor and home-maker Florence Deans. Nye received a B. A. in philosophy from Radcliffe College (Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study) in 1961 and a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Oregon in 1977. Nye has been affiliated with the University of Wisconsin‚ÄîWhitewater for decades; first as an assistant professor from 1978 to 1985, then as an associate professor from 1985‚Äì1990, followed by a position as a professor of philosophy from 1990‚Äì2002. Nye has been a professor emeritus for the philosophy and religious studies department since 2002. Andrea Nye is also a member of the Liberal Studies Division at the Boston Conservatory teaching interdisciplinary courses in the Humanities. Nye's early work in philosophy of language included a thesis on private language and a monograph on the history of logic from a feminist perspective. In subsequent work, Nye turned more specifically to issues related to gender in language, the place of women in the history of philosophy, and feminist theory. Reviving the work of neglected or misinterpreted women thinkers was of special interest in later work, including translations and commentary on the letters of Elisabeth of the Palatinate to Ren√© Descartes (The Princess and the Philosopher), the political thought of Rosa Luxemburg, Hannah Arendt, and Simone Weil (Philosophia) and most recently, Diotima‚Äôs teaching on erotic desire in Plato‚Äôs Symposium (hl)(Socrates and Diotima).

Albies signed with the Braves organization in 2013, and made his MLB debut with the team in 2017. During his first full season, Albies was named to the 2018 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In 2019, he won the National League Silver Slugger Award for second basemen. Early life Albies was born in Willemstad, Cura√ßao, to parents Osgarry and Judari. His father died in 2013 of a heart attack, aged 40. Albies has a younger brother, Zhhihir, and sister, Jeanalyn.  Career  =Minor leagues= Albies started playing baseball at the age of six, and began switch hitting in 2013. Discovered by the Cura√ßao-based scout Dargello Lodowica, Albies was signed by the Atlanta Braves for $350,000 as an international free agent on July 2, 2013. Influencing his decision to sign was the Braves' connection to Andruw Jones and Andrelton Simmons, both, like Albies, natives of Cura√ßao. He made his professional debut in 2014 with the Gulf Coast Braves and joined the Danville Braves in July. In 57 games, Albies hit .364/.446/.444 with a home run. After the season, he was ranked among the top 100 prospects in baseball by Keith Law, and fifth-best in Braves farm system by Baseball America. Albies began the 2015 season with the Rome Braves. In July, he was named to the All Star Futures Game. He was the only Braves prospect to appear in the game that year, as well as the youngest player on the field. Albies went 1-2 in the game, which the World Team lost to the U.S. 10‚Äì1. He fractured his right thumb during the first week of August and missed the remainder of the season. In 98 games, Albies hit .310/.368/.404 and stole 29 bases. MLB.com placed him third on the list of top Braves prospects at the end of 2015, and 30th overall throughout the minors. Albies was invited to spring training in 2016, and opened the season with the Double A Mississippi Braves. After 22 appearances with Mississippi, he hit .369/.442/.512 and was promoted to the Triple A Gwinnett Braves on April 30. In two months with Gwinnett, Albies hit .248/.307/.351. On June 30, he returned to Mississippi, playing second base alongside shortstop Dansby Swanson. Upon Swanson's promotion to the major leagues, Albies remained in Mississippi, having hit for a .292 batting average and a .778 OPS between the Double A and Triple A levels. Mississippi made the Southern League playoffs, but Albies injured his right elbow in the first postseason game and sat out the remainder of the season. =Atlanta Braves= Albies was again invited to spring training at the start of the 2017 season. He was called up later that year on August 1, and made his major league debut against the Los Angeles Dodgers. On August 3, 2017, against the Dodgers, Albies hit his first career home run for his first Major League hit. Albies was part of the Braves' Opening Day starting lineup to open the 2018 season. On June 12, 2018, Albies hit a grand slam against the New York Mets en route to an 8‚Äì2 win. Albies became the youngest player ever to have two grand slams. On June 25, 2018, Albies hit his first career walk-off home run against the Cincinnati Reds. On July 8, 2018, while owning a .281 batting average with 18 home runs and 50 RBIs, Albies was named an All-Star via the player vote in his first full year in the major leagues. On July 11, against the Toronto Blue Jays, he had his first career multi-home run game. On April 11, 2019, Albies signed a seven-year, $35 million extension to remain with the Braves. The deal includes options for the 2026 and 2027 seasons. Both years are worth $7 million with a $4 million buyout. In 2019, he batted .295/.352/.500 with 102 runs, 24 home runs and 86 RBIs. Albies and teammates Ronald Acu√±a Jr. and Freddie Freeman won the 2019 National League Silver Slugger Awards for second base, outfield, and first base, respectively. On defense, in 2019 he had the best fielding percentage of all major league second basemen (.994). In 2020, he batted .271/.306/.466 with 6 home runs and 19 RBIs.

Range It occurs in Sudan, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe and the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in South Africa. Description Leaves are 3.5 x 1.5 cm, obovate to oblanceolate with acute apex and decurrent base, and minutely puberulous on veins of lower surface.\\"Forest Flora of Northern Rhodesia\\" - F. White (Oxford University Press, 1962) Flowers are terminal in thyrsoid panicles, at ends of short lateral shoots, and are very fragrant. Calyx small and much shorter than corolla, glabrous to scabrid- pubescent; lobes up to 2.5 mm long, lanceolate. Corolla white, greenish-white or yellow, with touches of red in bud; glabrous or puberulous; tube cylindrical below, bell-shaped or campanulate above; lobes 5‚Äì6, ovate, ciliolate; style long, strongly protruding from the corolla. The tree produces ellipsoid, reddish-grey-brown capsules of about 2.5 √ó 1 cm, covered in prominent lenticels, splitting from the apex into 2 valves, which in turn may split for a short distance. Its seeds are straw-coloured, 1.6 √ó 1.0 cm, and somewhat elliptic, compressed and winged, the wing notched at the hilar end, and the seed coat strongly reticulate and slightly shiny. The genus Hymenodictyon dates back to 1824 and was created by Nathaniel Wallich, the Danish botanist and Superintendent of the Calcutta Botanical Garden, and its description was included in William Roxburgh's Flora Indica. Pharmacological properties A methanol extract of the bark showed broad antifungal and antibacterial activity. The species is used as a malarial febrifuge. An infusion of the stem bark is used in the treatment of skin diseases, venereal diseases and dysentery. A decoction of plant parts is drunk by children experiencing breathing difficulty. Its roots are used for snake bites and as a purgative. Etymology 'Hymeno'= membrane, and refers to the thin wing around each seed - 'dictyon'= reticulate pattern or network - 'parvifolium'= small leaf.

Petronella Oortman should not be confused with her close namesake Petronella Oortmans-de la Court (1624‚Äì1707), who as it happens was also the owner of a noted dollhouse now in the collection of the Centraal Museum, Utrecht. Biography Jacob Appel, 1710. Oortman grew up as one of seven children near the Singel canal, the daughter of a gun-maker. Oortman was a wealthy widow by the time she married silk merchant Johannes Brandt,Broomhall and Spinks 110. with whom she lived on Warmoesstraat in Amsterdam. Like other rich women in Amsterdam,Broomhall and Spinks 99. she had a dollhouse built for her that she curated between 1686 and 1710, decorating it with expensive materials and miniatures. At that time gentlemen often possessed \\"cabinets of curiosities\\" to hold collections of various objects they had acquired in their lives and travels: indeed such a cabinet can be seen in the small reception room (which also doubled as a funeral parlour) at the bottom right of the dollhouse. In the Amsterdam of the Dutch Golden Age, their wealthy wives similarly created dollhouses as status symbols. The exact location of Oortman's house on Warmoesstraat is no longer known, and opinions differ as to how exact a copy the dollhouse would have been, but it would have represented Oortman's dreams and aspirations. Visitors to the household would be shown all the dollhouse's features in sessions that often lasted the entire evening. After Oortman's death, the dollhouse passed to her daughter Hendrina and thence to Hendrina's brother Jan after 1743. According to Hendrina, her mother lavished some 30,000 guilders on the dollhouse, an enormous sum certainly sufficient to buy a canal house of the time. However, an inventory of Jan's estimated its value at just 700 guilders. By way of comparison, Petronella de la Court's dollhouse, for which 1,600 pieces of furniture and paintings and 28 fine dolls were commissioned, was sold in 1744 for 1,200 guilders. Already celebrated in the 18th century, Oortman's dollhouse was bought by the state in 1821 and purchased by the Rijksmuseum in 1875. A painting of the dollhouse was made in 1710 by Jacob Appel. =The dollhouse= The dollhouse contains nine rooms. The current state of the rooms is still very much like it was depicted in Appel's painting, though only a few of the dolls remain: only the child in the nursery is left. Also missing are the doll clothes, which were still visible in a photograph from the 1950s.Winkelman 100. Willem Frederiksz van Royen painted a mural in the game room, and Johannes Voorhout decorated the tapestry room.Scott 80. Porcelain objects were ordered from China.Miller 45. There are various accounts that Peter the Great attempted to buy such a dollhouse. Harry Donga suggests that Oortman's was the dollhouse manufactured on the order of for Peter the Great; the Russian emperor stayed with the Van Brants family for a few days during his second visit to the Netherlands but left, allegedly after Van Brants and the emperor had a falling-out over the 30,000-guilder price demanded by Van Brants.Donga 57‚Äì58. The dollhouse was the inspiration for the 2014 novel The Miniaturist by Jessie Burton.

In his later years he became, in addition, a distinguished librarian. Life =Early years= Bruno Kaiser was the son of a high school teacher who was also a passionate collector of, among other things, antique prints. In addition to his school education, Bruno Kaiser learned from his father a knowledge of collecting and a love of literature and of collecting that formed the basis for much of his later life. Following the successful completion of his school career he went on to Berlin's Humboldt University where he studied Literary sciences and Art history. He also started contributing to the venerable Vossische Zeitung (newspaper), initially on a voluntary basis and later as a contributing editor. Kaiser's period of study at the university was later terminated before completion and at some point he became an Antifascist activist. On 10 May 1932 Kaiser was one of a number of intellectuals showing public solidarity with the anti-war anti-Fascist campaigner Carl von Ossietzky, attempting to accompany the condemned man all the way to the prison door after the failure of his appeal hearing. In January 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power in Germany and early in 1934 the Vossische Zeitung was closed down which left Bruno Kaiser without a job. Under the new regime his record of anti-Fascist campaigning and his Jewish family background restricted his job opportunities in journalism, and he was already suffering from tuberculosis, but he continued working against Fascism, distributing illegal leaflets with anti-Fascist content. In 1938 he was arrested, interrogated and tortured, but no charges were preferred against him and he was released, albeit now under police surveillance. Still in 1938, he now took the first opportunity to emigrate, initially to Belgium. =Exile= Kaiser used his exile to study in libraries in Belgium, the Netherlands and France, making a speciality of unearthing and rediscovering long forgotten publications from classical writers whose better remembered works inspired Workers' movements in the twentieth century, notably Friedrich Engels. Despite the restrictions imposed by exile, his life was intricately bound up with literature and with progressive thinking, even where his sources dated back a hundred years or more. For Europe the Second World War was broke out in September 1939 and in May 1940 the fighting moved west with the German invasion of Belgium. Kaiser was interned in Belgium and then moved under detention to France where he was held in several locations, ending up in the Gurs internment camp in the south of the country. Here he suffered a recurrence of his tuberculosis. Communists in Marseilles now arranged for Bruno Kaiser to be transferred to Switzerland for medical treatment, where he was re-interned in the canton of Baselland. In Liestal, the cantonal capital, he was permitted to catalogue and sort the large volume of papers left by Georg and Emma Herwegh which had been gifted to the municipality by the couple's son, Marcel Herwegh. In 1946, shortly after the war, with the help of Kaiser's work on inventorizing the archive, the municipality was able to open the Liestal Poets and Town Museum, its ground floor devoted to the Herweghs and their literary output. In 1943 Kaiser also joined the Swiss branch of the (increasingly Soviet sponsored) Free Germany Movement (BFD / Bewegung Freies Deutschland). =Marxist librarian= In the summer of 1947, after a period in Belgium, Bruno Kaiser, with his wife Stascha, returned to Berlin which by now was in the Soviet occupation zone (SBZ / Sowjetische Besatzungszone) of what remained of Germany. He became a Departmental Director at the Berlin State Library where between 1947 and 1949 he concentrated on sorting out and preserving book collections confiscated by the Nazis in 1933 from Workers' Movement libraries. His own book collection, acquired during his youth and subsequent exile, already made him one of the most important bibliophile/book collectors in what was becoming the German Democratic Republic (formally founded in 1949 from what till then had been the SBZ).Bruno Kaiser: Bibliophilie im Sozialismus. In: Neues Deutschland 18 July 1959, Supplement No.28 During this time he was living at an address in the \\"vor Sch√∂nholz Street\\" (\\"Stra√üe vor Sch√∂nholz\\") which after 1953, together with the adjacent \\"Beatrice Zweig Street\\" (\\"Beatrice-Zweig-Stra√üe\\"), would comprise the Berlin's officially designated \\"Erich Weinert Quarter\\" (\\"Erich-Weinert-Siedlung\\"), known within East Germany as the home of the literary scholars, artists and other intelligentsia favoured by the authorities. Around this time he also received his doctorate. In May 1948 Kaiser became a member of the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands) which had been formed two years earlier in the Soviet administered zone of Germany through a controversial merger of the Communist Party with the more moderately left-wing SPD (party). Also in 1948 Kaiser visited Moscow in order to undertake research work at the city's Institute for Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. He was able to set up meetings leading to various agreements for future cooperation and literary exchanges. The most visible agreement involved the creation of an equivalent Institute for Marxism‚ÄìLeninism in the German Democratic Republic, and this was duly founded in Berlin by The Party in March 1949, a party-political teaching institution with its own research department and a major political-academic library at its heart. Kaiser was put in charge of creating and managing the Berlin institute, which now became his life's work, and a responsibility that closely matched his interest, abilities and experience. In October 1949 he was appointed the institute's first librarian. Building the library from nothing, and with necessarily restricted funding, involved a large amount of book collecting, for which he had already demonstrated his talents, and Kaiser also undertook extensive international networking with institutional heads in other countries.D.

Stroech ,40 Jahre Bibliothek des Instituts f√ºr Marxismus-Leninismus beim ZK der SED - 40 Jahre bliographische Arbeit‚Äú, in: ZfB, 103 (1989) 1, p.1 In 1950 he set up the International Bibliography of Marxist Periodicals. In the same year a photo-laboratory and bookbinding department were added. Another particular achievement by Kaiser was the location and acquisition of the greater part of the reference libraries of Karl Marx und Friedrich Engels. During his more than two decades Kaiser also published numerous articles and books and built up a substantial reputation in the field of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist scholarship. Additionally, in 1961 he received a professorship. =Retirement and death= In 1972 Bruno Kaiser retired from The Institute that he had created. On 27 January 1982 he died, slightly more than a week before his 72nd birthday. His remains were placed with others of the country's elite in the Friedrichsfelde Main Cemetery. His own library and literary archive went to the Berlin State Library.

It was first flown in the early 1950s, though the last of the three examples completed did not fly until almost forty years later. Design and development The Donald is a conventionally laid-out single engine, braced high wing monoplane. Its low aspect ratio (5.1) wings are unswept and of constant chord, with blunt, rounded tips; they carry short, broad ailerons but no flaps. There are V-form struts between the wing and lower fuselage on each side. At the rear the vertical surfaces are rounded and the balanced rudder extends down to the keel. The horizontal tail is tapered with rounded tips and the elevators have a cut-out for rudder movement. Behind the engine the fuselage is flat sided. The pilot's windscreen is just ahead of the wing leading edge but the side glazing of the single-seat cabin extends back to about two-thirds chord. The cabin roof extends into raised rear fuselage decking, which drops away slowly to the tail. The Donald has a tailskid undercarriage with main wheels mounted on split axles, hinged on a shallow V-strut attached to the fuselage underside. Faired, tapered legs are mounted on the lower fuselage longerons. The first prototype, with only from its Volkswagen 1.1 litre air-cooled flat-four engine, first flew on 16 June 1953.

It is located in the Najafgarh tehsil of the South West Delhi district. Dichaon Khurd (see Khurd and Kalan) is located nearby. Dichaon Kalan village was established nearly 800 years ago.  History  The village is declared a Model Village. The old timers relate this with its so called real name- Dev Uvach which means, from the mouth of Gods. The village has been in the news due to its musclemen. It looks like a prosperous village as the presence of the neo-riches is dominant. Further, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and other agencies have been involved in taking up a number of projects around this village.url=http://www.millenniumpost.in/NewsContent.aspx?NID=7263 Starting in 1992, Dichaon Kalan and its neighbouring village Mitraon (or Mitraun) became a battleground for criminal gangs operating out of Delhi. Dichaon Kalan is the stronghold of Kishan Pahalwan's gang, while Mitraun was the stronghold of its rival Anoop-Balraj gang. Annop and Balraj were sons of Surat Kane, a well- known gangster of the 1990s. When Kane tried to grab a piece of land from the local landlord Balwan Fauji, the latter hired Kishan Pahalwan to fight with Kane's gang. Balraj and Kishan were once friends, but a property dispute led to a bitter conflict between the two, in which a number of people lost their lives. The roots of the conflict go to 1992, when Kishan Pahalwan of Dichaon Kalan and Anoop-Balraj gang of Mitraon fought over a civic contract. After committing a murder to avenge the killing of his uncle Rohtash, Pahalwan was arrested in 1992, but released five years later. During his stay in the prison, he formed a criminal gang. As property rates in the NCR region rose, criminals from both the villages entered into the business of property dealing and tender grabbing. Pahalwan became close to Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), the ruling party in the neighbouring state of Haryana. Between 1996 and 1998, when a prohibition was in effect in Haryana, Pahalwan bootlegging business made him rich and powerful. Subsequently, Pahalwan started eliminating his rivals. Pahalwan's gang killed Balraj in 1998. Pahalwan was arrested that year, but released. Balraj's brother Anoop tried to reach a compromise with Pahalwan's gang, but was unsuccessful. He then started killing Pahalwan's men, and Pahalwan fled to Australia. In September 1999, Anoop's gang shot dead Pahalwan's 22-year old brother Kuldeep. In retaliation, Anoop's 19-year old nephew Yash Pal was killed by Pahalwan's gang on the same day. Pahalwan returned to India in 2003, and was arrested by the Delhi police before being released. Anoop's henchmen made several attempts to kill him. In 2004, Pahalwan's gang killed Anoop and two police officers as Anoop was being brought to a Rohtak court. Subsequently, most of other members of the Anoop- Balraj gang were also killed. Kishan Pahalwan then entered politics. In 2007, his brother Bharat Singh won the municipal polls from the Dichaon Kalan ward, and became a councillor. In 2008, Bharat Singh was elected as an INLD MLA to the Delhi Legislative Assembly. Pahalwan then filled the seat vacated by his brother; his wife Neelam was also elected a councillor. Bharat Singh was involved in the land-grabbing business, and took advantage of the real estate boom in the NCR region. He acquired several disputed properties, sometimes creating a dispute where there was none. Pahalwan was arrested again in 2009; by this time, he had 27 murder cases against him. Meanwhile, newer gangsters challenged Kishan-Bharat gang, in an attempt to control the extortion and property-related business in the area. One of these was the local criminal Udayveer alias Kaale, whose father and brother had allegedly been killed at the behest of Kishan Pahalwan. In 2012, Bharat Singh allegedly tried to grab a piece of land owned by the kin of another gangster Vicky. Subsequently, a group of eight gunmen tried to kill Bharat Singh in his office, but he escaped. The attack was allegedly ordered by Vicky and Kaale. Singh lost a kidney and spent two months in the hospital. Singh lost the 2013 Assembly election, and started focusing on his property business. In 2015, following a property dispute with Vikas Lagapuria, he was murdered by over six armed men. Kaale and three others were arrested for the murder.  Demographics  According to the 2011 Census of India, Dichaon Kalan has a population of 27,255, including 14,553 males and 12,702 females. The village has 5172 households. The literacy rate of the village is 74.48%. Dichaon Kalan is a Jat-dominated village inhabited by people belonging to the following gotra: Sangwan, Panghal, Tehlan, Shokeen , Shokhanda, Dagar. Scheduled caste people comprise 14.37% of the village's population. Economy Some of villagers are property dealers. 75% of the population of this village is involved in farming. They dedicate 9 to 10 months of a year to produce various types of cauliflower like Madhuri, Aganya etc. to fulfill almost 95% of the consumption of this vegetable in the city. For more than 60 years the village sends fleets of trucks loaded with cauliflower everyday to the wholesale markets or mandis. This village grows 98% of total cauliflower in Delhi.

Marriott Corp., 4th Circuit.http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district- courts/FSupp/875/289/1395305/ This was due to events beginning in 1992 by Marriott Corp. to split into two entities, giving all $2.4 billion of its debt to one of them, the less profitable, to be burdened with interest costs at 2/3 its cash flows. This was unanticipated, and caused immediate drop in market value of the debt by 30 percent. In 1993, a revised restructuring plan was announced that moved $450 million debt to the other entity, which was accepted by all creditors but PPM America, Inc., which held $120 million of debt issued in April, 1992.

Discovery A vertebra of Qijianglong was first discovered in the early 1990s by farmer Cai Changming of Heba village, Sechuan, in his backyard. Work at a nearby construction site at Qijiang District uncovered a rich fossil quarry in 2006. Its excavation caused an examination of the earlier find which led to the discovery of a skeleton. In 2015, the type species Qijianglong guokr was named and described by Xing Lida (China University of Geosciences), Tetsuto Miyashita (University of Alberta), Zhang Jianping, Li Daqing, Ye Yong (Zigong Dinosaur Museum), Toru Sekiya (Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum), Wang Fengping and Philip John Currie. The generic name combines the district Qijiang with Mandarin long, \\"dragon\\". The specific name guokr, \\"nutshell\\", is that of a Chinese scientific social network. The holotype QJGPM 1001 was found in a layer of the Suining Formation, which was seen as dating from the Late Jurassic but is now considered mid-Cretaceous (late Aptian) based on radiometric dating.Wang, J.; Norell, M. A.; Pei, R.; Ye, Y.; Chang, S.-C (2019). Surprisingly young age for the mamenchisaurid sauropods in South China. Cretaceous Research doi:10.1016/j.cretres.2019.07.006. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull. It includes the rear of the skull, a partial right lower jaw, a complete series of seventeen neck vertebrae, the first six back vertebrae, ribs, the probable tenth tail vertebra, a series of twenty- eight rear tail vertebrae, chevrons, the left pubic bone and two upper pedal phalanges. It likely represents a juvenile individual, large but immature. The holotype of Qijianglong was about fifteen meters long and had a long neck. The describing authors established several distinguishing traits among which four autapomorphies. On the lower braincase the processus basipterygoideus has the form of a plate, is oriented along the body axis, and has an additional boss parallel to the tubera basilaria. The neck vertebrae have rear joint processes, postzygapophyses that next to their normal facets show on the outside an additional finger-shaped extension, stiffening the neck in the horizontal plane but allowing vertical movement. The rear neck vertebrae have pneumatopores, pneumatic openings, in the depression between the diapophysis, the upper rib joint process, and the neural spine. The pubic bone has a concave front edge, curving so strongly that its lower end is more directed to the front than to below. Systematics Qijianglong was placed in the family Mamenchisauridae, in a relatively basal position but above Omeisaurus tianfuensis in the evolutionary tree.

After a successful musical career, he became an historian, archaeologist and preservationist. He is widely remembered as a performer and co-writer on John Denver's song Rocky Mountain High. Early life Michael C. Taylor was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, the son of Katie Steed and George F. Taylor. As a boy, he and his father collected native American arrowheads and similar artifacts around the area where they lived. As a teenager, he taught himself to play the acoustic guitar. By his late teens and early twenties, he had become the lead guitarist for folk singers in both Fayetteville and New York. Musical career Mike rose quickly in the music world, serving as lead guitarist for Joni Mitchell and similar artists, all before his 21st birthday. Herb Metoyer was one of his early influences and mentors. He joined The John Denver Band in 1969, and was involved in writing, arranging, and performing such songs as \\"Rocky Mountain High\\", \\"Sunshine on My Shoulders\\", and \\"The Eagle and the Hawk\\". During these years his guitar technique often led to his being thought of as the best guitarist in the country. Rocky Mountain High Taylor was given songwriting and performing credit for this John Denver hit, which is one of the two state songs of Colorado. In an interview, Denver said of the song's creation \\"Mike sat down and showed me this guitar lick and suddenly the whole thing came together. It was just what the piece needed. When I realized what I had ‚Äî another anthem, maybe; a true expression of one's self, maybe ‚Äî we changed the sequencing of the album we'd just completed, and then we changed the album title.\\" Historian, archaeologist and preservationist In the early 1970s, he moved to Hilton Head, South Carolina, where his interest in the past was rekindled. He enrolled in the University of South Carolina, studying archaeology and anthropology. He became a research fellow in those fields at the university, and changed his career focus to those areas. In 1985, he and a group of Hilton Head residents began creating what is now called the Coastal Discovery Museum. Taylor became its first director in 1988. He later wrote and narrated Mike Taylor‚Äôs History of Hilton Head Island, an audiocassette feature in Southern Living magazine, and a video series about Hilton Head that aired on the History Channel, as well as several similar projects. In 2002, Taylor was named Executive Director of the South Carolina Battleground Preservation Trust.

He was convicted of corruption and received a death sentence with reprieve on July 2013, although he died of cancer while in prison on July 2016. Biography Luo was born in Gaozhou, Guangdong province, considered part of the municipal region of Maoming. Luo first worked as an elementary school teacher, then worked as part of a rural commune in his home county. In 1990 he was named county governor of Gaozhou. When the county earned \\"city\\" status in 1993, Luo became its first Mayor, and a year later became Communist Party Secretary of Gaozhou. In 1998 he became the Secretary-General of the Maoming Party Committee, and in 2001, became deputy Party Secretary of Maoming. Between 2003 and 2007 Luo served as Mayor of Maoming, then he was promoted to Party Secretary. On February 11, 2011, Luo was arrested by prosecution authorities to face corruption-related charges. Maoming had been on the radar of provincial disciplinary authorities beginning in 2009, as the city was believed to be the site of widespread buying and selling of official posts. Since 2009, hundreds of officials in the city had been investigated or charged. It was suspected that Luo's \\"corrupt earnings\\" totaled over 100 million yuan (~$16 million). In July 2013, Luo was convicted of bribery and \\"amassing wealth of unclear origin,\\" and was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve. Regarding his arrest, Luo was widely reported to have said, \\"you say I am a corrupt official? Who at my level is not a corrupt official? Why are you coming after me? If you truly had the guts, ask me who in Maoming is corrupt, I can spend three days and three nights telling you! Isn't China just corrupt officials promoting other corrupt officials, corrupt officials combating corruption?\\" While in prison, Luo worked a day job putting together light bulbs. He told television reporters that he had somehow managed to increase efficiency of lightbulb production from 1,000 to 4,000 per day. In an interview with Xinkuaibao, a local newspaper, Luo denied allegations that he was a luoguan. He said he missed his wife, who was also in prison, and that the two could only communicate by letter once every two or three months. He also said that some of his prison mates still addressed him \\"Mr. Secretary,\\" while others called him \\"old Luo\\". Other Party Secretaries of Maoming, Zhou Zhenhong and Liang Yimin, were also investigated for corruption in 2012 and 2014, respectively. Luo died of cancer while in prison on 22 July 2016.

Frauenbad Stadthausquai is a public bath in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, forming part of the historical Seeuferanlage promenades that were built between 1881 and 1887. Situated at the Stadthausquai by the B√ºrkliplatz plaza, the bath was built for, and is still exclusively used by women (Frauenbad means \\"bath for women\\").  Geography  The small river bath is situated at B√ºrkliplatz below the Quaibr√ºcke, just south of the artificial Bausch√§nzli island, in the Limmat. Road transport on Stadthausquai towards M√ºnsterhof is limited; the next tram stop is at B√ºrkliplatz or M√ºnsterbr√ºcke, opposite of the upper Limmatquai towards Bellevueplatz.  History and description  Z√ºrich's government decided in 1837 to build a public bath for women, so that \\"they are no longer forced to bath at night in the fountains\\" and to protect them from the eyes of men. The former structure at the Bausch√§nzli was replaced in 1888 by the nostalgic Laubs√§geli (literally: fretsaw) bath, named for its oriental curved corner turrets. The interior was covered in the early years with a braided roof as a sun shade. Moored on the river Limmat, the small wooden bath is well arranged and is open only to women, except for special events. In the pool is a non-swimming section.

Though the time of its establishment could not be ascertained, historians believe that the river fort was built by Mir Jumla II, a Subahdar of Bengal under the Mughal Empire, to defend Dhaka and Narayanganj from pirates. History Bengal went under the effective control of the Mughal Empire in 1574 AD after the defeat of Daud Khan Karrani by the Mughal General Munim Khan. Mughals exercised a progressive rule in Bengal and were determined to protect their subjects from external forces. Mir Jumla II was appointed as the Subahdar or governor of the then Bengal province in 1660 AD. He was aware of the pirates who ran a campaign of terror in the important cities of Bengal. In a quest to protect the capital Dhaka from the pirates, Mir Jumla II decided to build three river forts around Dhaka, including Sonakanda Fort. Though archaeologists cannot trace any evidence on its date of establishment, according to historians the construction of the fort started between 1660 and 1663 AD.  Structure The square holes on the fort's wall were likely used by artillery The fort combines thick walls, a massive artillery platform and a gateway to the north. The fort has two main parts. One is a fortified defensive wall of gigantic dimensions. The defensive walls are 3.05 metres in height and thicker at the bottom. Several wide and narrow loopholes allowed guns and light cannons to fire shells at the pirates. The other one is a raised outwork on the western face to defend the fort from the attack of the pirates. The most significant structure of the fort is the massive artillery platform. One of the spherical artillery platforms has a stairway, which leads up to the artillery platform. Cannons with bigger calibre were placed on there, aiming at the aggressors coming up the Shitalakshya River. This is a unique feature of the river forts built by Mughal Empire. The platform is surrounded by two circular structures of which the diameter of the inner one is 15.70 metres and the diameter of the outer one is 19.35 metres. The structure is 6.09 metres in height and surrounded by walls. The fort is quadrangular in plan, measuring 86.56 by 57.0 metres. There are octagonal bastions on the four corners of the fort. The corner bastions on both sides of the western wing are wider than those of the eastern wing, which are 4.26 metres, while the two on the western wing are 6.85 metres in width. The only gate of the fort is on the north. The arched entrance is placed within a rectangular frame. The gateway is higher than the average height of the walls of fort and decorated with several groomed panels. Myths The fort is located in Narayanganj There are a number of myths related to the river fort that include tragedy and mystery. * Princess Swarnamoyee was abandoned by her father Kedar Roy, a king of Bikrampur. She went to the Shitalakshya River with her barge to perform the sacred bath. Unfortunately, the pirates attacked her barge that day and looted all the valuables she had. They also kidnapped the princess. She was later saved by Isa Khan, the ruler of Sonargaon. Isa Khan brought her to the Sonakanda Fort and asked her father to take her back. Kedar Roy, however, refused to take her back as she had lost her caste by spending a night in a tent owned by a Muslim ruler. Swarnamoyee, shocked by the incident, cried for several days in her tent at Sonakanda Fort. According to a popular belief the name of the fort is derived from this incident as the Swarnamoyee in other words Sona, cried a lot in this fort. The Bengali for crying is kanda. * Another version of the story says that Isa Khan forcefully married Sona Bibi, a widowed daughter of Kedar Roy. She was brought to this fort and put under confinement by Isa Khan's soldiers. She cried following the incident and the name of the fort derived from that. * Some people believe that there were some hidden tunnels in the fort that linked it with Sonargaon and Lalbagh Fort.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1887 to 1889 by Thomas Rees. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  St Paul's Presbyterian Church (left) and Hall (right), circa 1912 St Paul's Presbyterian Church, a Gothic-style stone building which dominates the skyline at Spring Hill, was constructed between 1887 and 1889. The congregation of St Paul's, which at the time was a member of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland, founded their first Brisbane church on the corner of Creek and Adelaide Streets in 1863. This early timber structure was replaced in 1876 by a stone building of substantial proportions, which in turn was sold to the Queensland National Bank in 1886 and subsequently demolished. The sale enabled the purchase of a site in Leichhardt Street, Spring Hill for the construction of a new place of worship. Former Queensland Colonial Architect Francis Drummond Greville Stanley was commissioned to design a building well beyond immediate requirements, in anticipation of the church playing a more prominent role in the development of Queensland Presbyterianism. Stanley had designed a number of masonry churches, including Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Fortitude Valley (1877), St Thomas' Anglican Church in Toowong (1877), and St Paul's Anglican Church in Maryborough (1879). In 1886 a brick and stone Sabbath School Hall was erected on a corner of the site, and this building served as a temporary church for three years while the larger building was designed and constructed. Contractor for the ¬£11,000 project was builder and alderman Thomas Rees (later mayor of Brisbane), who completed construction of the church in a little over 18 months. The foundation stone was laid on 8 October 1887 and the church was officially dedicated on 5 May 1889. Much of the stone from the demolished Creek Street church was re-used in the Leichhardt Street church. Also a stone wall with Glasgow- founded iron railings and entrance gates, a pipe organ manufactured by William Hill & Sons, London , and prophet lights donated in 1878 by former Queensland Premier Sir Thomas McIlwraith, were removed to the new site. Despite grand visions of St Pauls as the state centre of Presbyterian worship, the congregation was small and localised until the early 20th century, when a change of ministry encouraged a more active following. The interior of the church was redesigned in 1901. The organ and choir stalls were moved from a prominent position beneath the central arch to the southwest transept, and the pulpit was centrally elevated. St Paul's became a community landmark in Spring Hill, recognised officially with the mid-1930s renaming of a section of Leichhardt Street from Boundary Road to Brookes Street as St Pauls Terrace. A number of church facilities were extended in the post-war period. This involved installation of an electronic carillon (\\"the chimes\\") in 1950; commissioning of stained glass lights ‚Äì designed by William Bustard in 1957 and executed by Oliver Cowley between 1958 and 1972 ‚Äì for the aisle windows; the addition of an electro-pneumatic action to the organ in 1963; and the inclusion of a columbarium in 1967. Renovation of the cedar pulpit, rostrum and communion table was undertaken in 1976. In the early 1980s the Friends of St Paul's was established, which conducted an appeal to raise funds for restoration work. Funds from the appeal and various grants permitted repairs to some of the ornamental stonework. To help finance a complete restoration, the rights were sold to develop an office tower and townhouse complex on the site of the former manse, which was demolished. Eventually the land itself was sold.  Description  St Paul's Presbyterian Church is a stone, gothic- styled building complete with buttresses, belltower and a spire rising above the ground. Cruciform in shape, the design incorporates a nave, aisles, and well defined transepts. The chancel is truncated. Essentially the plan is symmetrical, with the addition of a small southwestern entry porch for the spiral staircase to the belltower. The steeply pitched gabled roof with ventilation gablets is clad in broad profile galvanised iron. Three distinct types of stone have been employed in the construction: rough dressed Brisbane tuff, probably from the Spring Hill and Windsor quarries, for the walls and buttresses; durable Helidon sandstone for the window facings; and a softer and less robust sandstone, possibly from Breakfast Creek or Goodna, for other facings and decorative work. At the front a pair of large cedar doors open to a main entry porch paved with tessellated black and white marble. One of the stained glass windows in the entrance, designed by Brisbane artist William Bustard and unveiled in 1923, depicts the apostle Nathaniel. This was donated by the Philp family, following the death in 1922 of former businessman and Queensland premier, Sir Robert Philp. The interior is simple yet impressive: the nave, with its stone pillars and gothic arches, is spacious; exposed wooden arches support a roof lining of diagonal tongue and groove, v-jointed red cedar; and the walls are rendered. Each aisle has its own roof, above which a sequence of cusped windows in the clerestory permits natural lighting of the nave. In the wall above the chancel are a rose window and four large stained glass windows of European manufacture, which depict old testament prophets. Double arched windows along the aisles illustrate ten events in the life of St Paul. Red cedar has been employed for internal joinery and furniture, and the sloping floor is of pine. St Paul's houses the only swung bell in Brisbane, which was cast in 1888 by John Warner & Sons, London. The bell chamber is noted for its perfect acoustic properties in transmitting sound to the nave. After more than a century of use, St Paul's remains intact in form, structure, fabric and function.  Heritage listing  St Paul's Presbyterian Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Paul's Presbyterian Church, constructed 1887-89, is significant historically for its association with the work of the Presbyterian Church in Queensland, and in particular, as evidence of the Creek Street congregation's anticipation of playing a prominent role in Queensland Presbyterianism. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of 19th century Gothic church design in Queensland: it remains substantially intact, and is one of few churches in Queensland to fully realise the \\"gothic\\" style in stone. In addition, St Paul's is significant for its early pipe organ, stained glass and swung bell. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has considerable landmark quality and aesthetic appeal, and makes a strong aesthetic contribution to both the Spring Hill townscape and the skyline along St Paul's Terrace. It remains an integral element in a cohesive ecclesiastical precinct formed with the adjoining church hall and boundary fence. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It also has historical significance as the origin of the name of a principal Brisbane street, St Paul's Terrace ‚Äì indicative of a wider community association with the church as a Brisbane landmark. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. St Paul's is important as a major example of the ecclesiastical work of former colonial architect FDG Stanley.

Background and summary In January 2012, Hari announced on his website that he was writing his first book, a study of the \\"war on drugs.\\" The release of the book coincided with the 100th anniversary of the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act in the United States, which was the world's first drug control legislation when it passed in December 1914. In Chasing the Scream, Hari writes that two global wars began in 1914: World War I, which lasted four years, and the war on drugs, which is ongoing. In the introduction to the book, Hari writes that one of his first memories was of trying and failing to wake up a relative from a \\"drugged slump,\\" and that he has always felt \\"oddly drawn to addicts and recovering addicts--they feel like my tribe, my group, my people.\\" He also discusses his history of abusing anti-narcolepsy medication, a class of prescription drugs sometimes taken by people without the disease in order to stay alert. Hari questions whether or not he is an addict and decides to go searching for answers to questions he has. \\"Why did the drug war start, and why does it continue? Why can some people use drugs without any problems, while others can't? What really causes addiction? What happens if you choose a radically different policy?\\" Hari writes that he spent the next three years in search of answers, traveling across nine countries (United States, Canada, Great Britain, Mexico, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, Uruguay and Vietnam). He profiles early figures in the drug war like jazz musician Billie Holiday, a long-time heroin addict; racketeer Arnold Rothstein, an early drug trafficker; and Harry J. Anslinger, the first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (who himself had a daily morphine habit). He also interviews drug addicts, dealers, police and lawmakers today, as well as scientists, drug addiction specialists and drug reform advocates like Danny Kushlick and Steve Rolles, as well as Jo√£o Goul√£o, a doctor who has helped steer Portugal's drug policy. One of his interviewees is Bruce K. Alexander, the researcher behind the \\"Rat Park\\" drug addiction experiments done in the 1970s. Alexander's hypothesis is that drugs themselves do not cause addiction, which is largely in contrast to current popular beliefs about drugs and drug addiction. Hari writes, ‚ÄúMany of our most basic assumptions about this subject are wrong. Drugs are not what we think they are. Drug addiction is not what we have been told it is. The drug war is not what our politicians have sold it as for one hundred years and counting.‚Äù =Source documentation= An introductory page of Chasing the Scream states that audio files of all quotes in the book from Hari's interviews are available online at the book's official website. On the site, it states that there are more than 400 quotes spoken to Hari appearing in the book: \\"To be as transparent as possible, they are posted on this website ‚Äì so as you read the book, you can listen the voices of the people in it, as they tell their stories for themselves.\\" The book also includes 60 pages of explanatory notes on sources and interviews. The website includes a section devoted to questions and corrections, with a note from Hari asking readers to submit any factual errors in the book to be corrected \\"for future editions and for the record.\\" This section also includes a few transcription errors from recorded interviews that were not noticed until after publication; for example, a quote from Bruce K. Alexander saying \\"...learning to deal with the modern age‚Äù was incorrectly transcribed and printed in the book as \\"...learning to live with the modern age.\\" Author and anti-plagiarism campaigner Jeremy Duns accused Hari of inaccuracy in some of his quotations, claiming that Hari had \\"twisted the truth here because it made his narrative cleaner\\". Book reception =Critical response= Chasing the Scream has received mostly positive reviews from critics and journalists. Kate Tuttle of the Boston Globe called it a \\"passionate, timely book\\" and that through reading the stories of Hari's interview subjects, including drug addicts, drug dealers, scientists and politicians, \\"their combined testimony forms a convincing brief that drug prohibition may have spawned as much crime, violence, and heartache as drug use ever did.\\" Reviewer Nick Romeo of The Christian Science Monitor wrote a lengthy synopsis on Chasing the Scream, analysing the book's presentation of the history of drug criminalisation, its racial aspects, and scientific data concerning addiction. Romeo wrote of Hari, \\"His reporting is balanced and comprehensive; he interviews police and prisoners, addicts and dealers, politicians and activists. He also delves into different historical periods as case studies on the costs and benefits of the drug war. His book should be required reading for anyone involved in the drug war, and a glance at the national budget shows that anyone who pays taxes is involved in the drug war.\\" Ed Vulliamy called the book a \\"righteous assault\\" and a \\"long-awaited history\\" on the war on drugs, \\"which imprisons millions and persecutes more.\\" He was critical that the book omitted two crucial aspects of the situation - the first being how the \\"war\\" is in reality one waged against addicts and not those who financially profit from drugs, and the second concerning details of how legalisation of drugs would work in practicality. Vulliamy concluded that omission of these aspects does not detract \\"from the book‚Äôs argument, or the righteous movement of which Hari is an estimable spokesman.\\" He noted the author's 2011 scandal, writing that a \\"shamed\\" Hari left to dedicate himself to documenting the war on drugs and that Chasing the Scream \\"is the prodigal fruit of that work, and with it redemption, if that was needed.\\" In his review for The Guardian, John Harris praised parts of the book but was negative overall. He wrote, that although the work is a \\"powerful contribution to an urgent debate\\" on drug policy, Hari employs a \\"gauche journalistic equivalent of the narrative voice found in Mills & Boon novels.\\" Harris also questioned why \\"a mere 52 words\\" are printed from Hari's interview with Dr. Robert DuPont, the first director of the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and the keynote speaker at a World Federation Against Drugs conference Hari attended. Harris also admitted Hari's past record presents a challenge to reviewers, and made him more skeptical over things such as the DuPont interview, writing, \\"though it might be nice to set aside the events of 2011 and allow him a fresh start, his misdemeanours inevitably colour your experience of the book.\\" Hugo Rifkind wrote in his review for The Times that it is \\"tempting, albeit petty, to read Chasing the Scream less as a book and more as an act of rehabilitation.\\" Rifkind ultimately called it \\"thoughtful, thorough and questing, and full of fresh and genuine reportage about aspects of the drug economy.\\" Kirkus Reviews praised the book, calling Hari \\"a sharp judge of character\\" and that the book is \\"a compassionate and humane argument to overturn draconian drug policies.\\" =Public response = The cover of the United Kingdom edition of Chasing the Scream features praise from Noam Chomsky, Sam Harris, Elton John, Naomi Klein, Stephen Fry and Pulitzer Prize winner Glenn Greenwald. David Nutt, an English psychiatrist and neuropsychopharmacologist specialising in drug research, wrote a positive review of Chasing the Scream for The Evening Standard. He praised Hari's research into the early events of anti-drug laws, some of which, Nutt noted, he himself had forgotten ever occurred. He called the personal stories of those affected the most \\"horrific\\", writing \\"The lack of evidence of the war having worked, alongside massive evidence of failure, are detailed with a frightening clarity.\\" Nutt, the former chief scientific advisor on drugs to the British government, concluded, \\"Read it and demand our politicians take note!\\" Norm Stamper, author and former chief of the Seattle Police Department, wrote, ‚ÄúJohann Hari has written a drug policy reform book like no other. Many have studied, or conducted, the science surrounding the manifold ills of drug prohibition. But Hari puts it all into riveting story form, and humanises it‚Ä¶ Part Gonzo journalism, part Louis CK standup, part Mark Twain storytelling, Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs is beautifully wrought: lively, humorous, and poignant. And, it‚Äôs a compelling case for why the drug war must end, yesterday.‚Äù Stephen Fry, whose 2014 memoir More Fool Me recalled his 15-year addiction to cocaine, praised the book: ‚ÄúThis book is, forgive the obvious phrase, screamingly addictive. The story it tells, jaw-droppingly horrific, hilarious and incredible, is one everyone should know: that it is all true boggles the mind, fascinates and infuriates in equal measure. Johann Hari, in brilliant prose, exposes one of the greatest and most harmful scandals of the past hundred years.‚Äù Seth Mnookin, professor of science writing at MIT, wrote in his New York Times review that Hari is \\"in over his head\\" when writing about the current science of addiction: \\"[H]is misunderstanding of some of the basic principles of scientific research ‚Äî that anecdotes are not data; that a conclusion is not a fact ‚Äî transforms what had been an affecting jeremiad into a partisan polemic.\\" Mnookin also characterises Hari's historical account of the early prohibition of drugs as \\"forced\\". In contrast, Mnookin's assessment of Hari's discussions of current events is generally quite positive.

The firm ranks as the nation‚Äôs 31st largest independent insurance brokerage firm based on 2015 revenue.100 Largest Brokers of U.S. Business History Paul C. Higginbotham founded his namesake agency in 1948 after returning from military service in World War II. It started as a small personal insurance brokerage firm in Paul‚Äôs Riverside neighborhood of Fort Worth, Texas. Paul‚Äôs nephew, Bill Stroud, purchased the agency in 1962 from his aunt who inherited it when Paul died. Between 1968 and 1983, the firm moved four times to more central locations in Fort Worth to attract an increasingly diverse clientele. In 1986, Bill hired Rusty Reid from American General Fire and Casualty Company to broker commercial insurance at Higginbotham. Three years later, Rusty became president and CEO at age 27. He implemented an employee ownership model to engage and reward employees in the company‚Äôs growth and established the firm‚Äôs Financial Services division to begin offering employee benefits. Higginbotham‚Äôs first geographic expansion occurred in 1998 with the opening of a second office in Dallas and was followed by several others in North and Central Texas. Then in 2007, the firm initiated an aggressive statewide growth strategy, merging with likeminded independent agencies that support its business model. Through mergers, Higginbotham has expanded its footprint to more than 20 offices spanning Texas. Of the 100 largest brokers of U.S. business, Higginbotham is the largest based in Texas by revenue.

It is located between Norway and Denmark in the east, Scotland and England in the west, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France in the south. The geology of the North Sea describes the geological features such as channels, trenches, and ridges today and the geological history, plate tectonics, geological events that created them. A geological basin is a large low-lying area or depression. It is often below sea level. Depressions are typically formed by tectonic processes acting on the lithosphere, providing \\"accommodation space\\" for sediment to be preserved. Basins are formed in a variety of tectonic settings: extensional, compressional, strike-slip and intraplate. Geological basins are one of the most common places which collect sediment. The type of rocks which form there tell about the palaeoclimate of the continent. The geology is of interest to oil prospectors, hydrologists and palaeontologists. Exploration in the North Sea was initiated in May 1964 when the first well was spudded and the area has now become one of the most prolific hydrocarbon provinces in the world. Total recoverable reserves found to date, including adjacent land areas, amount to over 100 billion barrels of oil and natural gas.Spencer, A.M., Leckie, G.G. and Chew, K.J. (1996) North Sea hydrocarbon plays and their resources. In: Glennie, K. and Hurst, A. (eds) Northwest Europe's Hydrocarbon Industry. Geological Society, London, pp. 25-41. Geologically speaking, the North Sea is divided into four main basins: Northern, Moray Firth, Central, and Southern. Each has a long and complex geologic history with unique structural and stratigraphic developments driven by tectonic events over the last 400 Million years. The northern North Sea Paleorift system, including the Viking and Sogn graben, is an approximately 150‚Äì200 km wide zone of extended upper crust with preserved strata from pre- Triassic to Tertiary. It is bounded by the Shetland Platform to the west and the Norwegian mainland to the east.  Evolutionary outline  The most important events in the geolocical evolution of the North Sea are outlined as: # Precambrian events - formation of Highlands and basement elements. # The Caledonian plate cycle - Late Cambrian to Late Silurian Athollian and Caledonian Orogenies. # The Variscan plate cycle - Devono-Carboniferous rifting, Variscan Orogency, and creation of the Pangaea supercontinent. # Permo-Triassic rifting and thermal subsidence - Late Permian subsidence of the Moray Firth and east-west trending of the Permian Basin. Subsequent Triassic to early Jurassic thermal subsidence was abruptly terminated by a phase of Middle Jurassic thermal doming. # Middle Jurassic domal uplift - development of transient mantle plume head leading to erosion of central North Sea, volcanism, and subsequent rift system. # Late Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous extensional tectonics - led to fault-block rotations and formation of major structural traps within and adjacent to the Viking and Central Grabens. In contrast to areas west of Shetland, the phase of extensional basin development was followed by a phase of post-rift thermal subsidence in the North Sea during the later Cretaceous and Cenozoic. # Development of the Iceland hot spot and North Atlantic rifting - during the Cretaceous, the onset of sea- floor spreading in the North Atlantic Ocean superseded North Sea tectonics. Opening of the Atlantic Ocean and the development of the Iceland hot spot were major factors in Cenozoic uplift and exhumation of the British Isles. This caused regional tilt, affecting the western rift arm of the North Sea and Inner Moray Firth. # Tectonic Inversion of Mesozoic basin - creation of the Atlantic Ocean caused intraplate compression, leading to the tectonic inversion of former sedimentary basins across north-west Europe during the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary. In general, pre-Triassic stratigraphy and rifting has been confirmed below the northern North Sea but is poorly known and little conclusive information exists about Devonian and Carboniferous extensional events. While precise dating and the spatial extent of the active stretching are uncertain, recent stratigraphic syntheses suggest syn-rift dates of no younger than Scythian, with a possible initiation during the late or even early Permian. The following middle Triassic to early Jurassic post- rift stage is considerable better known. Subsidence (approximately nine intervals) in the northern North Sea was accompanied by faulting, stepping down from both margins towards the present Viking Graben axis. Depositional environments pass from continental to marine, implying that the creation of new accommodation space outpaced sediment supply. It is likely that this was at least partly in response to thermal subsidence. The late Jurassic-early Cretaceous stretching event is also well constrained. Rotational movements on major fault zones bounding the northern Viking Graben commenced in the latest Bajocian-earliest Bathonian and ceased in the earliest Ryazanian. The depositional environments pass from coastal plain and shallow marine on the platforms and terraces bordering the Viking graben to deeper marine in the interior of the graben system. The Cretaceous-early Cenozoic succession in the norther North Sea largely represents post-rift infill, resulting from subsidence in response to lithospheric cooling following the late Jurassic- early Cretaceous stretching event. Subsequent Tertiary subsidence was segmented and interrupted by basin flank uplifts, whereas in the early Miocene the entire northernmost North Sea area became uplifted and eroded as a result of compressional tectonics in the Norwegian Sea.  Tectonostratigraphic model  McKenzie model (pure shear) In the northern North Sea, despite the substantial amount of data available, our understanding of the lithospheric processes governing extension are strongly model-based. The architecture and signature of the sediment infill in the northern North Sea can be discussed in the context of three distinct evolutionary stages of rift basin development separated by key geologic unconformities. The proto-rift stage describes the rift onset with either doming or flexural subsidence. Tabular architectures thickening across relatively steep faults, characterize the proto-rift stage. Active stretching and rotation of fault blocks then occurs during the main rift stage is then terminated by the development of the syn-rift unconformity. Syn-rift architectures can be highly variable depending on the ability of the available sediment supply to fill accommodation formed by rotation and subsidence during this stage. Where crustal separation is accomplished, a break-up unconformity commonly marks the boundary to the overlying thermal relaxation of post-rift stage. During the post-rift stage, an early phase with coarse clastic infilling of remnant rift topography often precedes late stage widening of the basin and filling with fine-grained sediments. These processes have been attributed to pure shear (crustal extension and faulting in the upper crust) and simple shear (ductile stretching in the lower crust) and coupled simple shear/pure shear flexural deformation. The combined thermal and elastic/isostatic response of the lithosphere to extension controls the crustal architecture and thereby the geometry of sedimentary basins, including those of the northern North Sea. = Proto-rift stage = The proto-rift stage is sometimes characterized by deposition in a wide, slowly subsiding flexural basin with only minor fault activity. During this stage, sedimentation is controlled primarily by climatic and, in marine settings, by relative sea- level fluctuations. In other rifts, progressive, thermally induced, upward displacement of the asthenosphere - lithosphere boundary by mantle plumes cause the gradual upward motion of broad rift domes that reach their maximum dimensions before or at the onset of active stretching. Proto-rift basins are typically saucer-shaped, slightly deepening towards the future graben axis, which can lead to large axial sediment transport systems. Domal uplift can occur contemporaneously with incipient subsidence in different segments of a proto-rift structure. The evolution of the Brent Delta System of the northern North Sea follows this model. Deposition of the Brent Group has been coupled with the growth and erosion of a mid-North Sea dome, as well as with non-dome related tectonics along the northern North Sea rift margins. As domal uplift related to incipient rifting is commonly associated with subsidence in its vicinity, erosional products tend to accumulate in associated depositional basins that may be a proto-rift, as with the Brent Delta system. A proto rift unconformity also develops in this situation as seen in the southern and central parts of the palaeorift system where domal structures were deeply eroded in the middle Jurassic which is known as the 'Mid-Cimmerian' unconformity. =Main rift stage= The main rift or \\"syn-rift\\" stage describes the phase of active stretching and fault block rotation. Syn-rift subsidence results from the elastic/isostatic adjustment of the crust due to mechanical stretching of the lithosphere. The subsidence is counteracted by upwelling of the asthenosphere into the space created by the mechanical stretching and thermal upward displacement of the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary, causing uplift of the rift zone. The fundamental architectural element in many extensional basins is the half-graben, formed within the hanging walls of major rift-bounding or intra-rift basin faults. The location and number of half grabens are influenced by the position of the main faults and the width of the rift zone, which depends on the rheology, crustal thickness and stretching factors. Half-graben and wedge-shaped infill geometries characterize both the Permo-Triassic and late Jurassic stretching events in the northern North Sea, most prominently in the area southwest of the Brent Field. This area shows a high degree of three-dimensional variability with an intermixing of proto-rift and post-rift geometries. More evidence of progressive rift climax with divergent stratal patterns occurs across the major eastern boundary fault of the East Shetland Platform. Another example from the Permo-Triassic succession on the Horda Platform shows fault- bounded, wedge-shaped units from this time period. The amount of divergence suggests maximum tilt rates and rift climax during deposition of the Permian to early Triassic unit. A late-rift or rift relaxation sub-stage has also been interpreted in the evolution and filling of the Oslo Graben. Variable rates of rotation across individual fault blocks initiated by subsidence have been interpreted in the upper Jurassic infill across the Oseberg Field. Several rotational maxima led to the deposition of wedge-shaped units downflank in hanging wall positions, in response to footwall crestal uplift and erosion. Interbedded tabular units were deposited during periods of general tectonic subsidence and minor rotation. Because the sedimentary infilling is a response to this tectonic scenario, a pattern of syn-rift architecture is recognizable, although it can be obscured by variation in sediment supply and sea-level. In the late-Jurassic sub-basins of the Northern North Sea, syn-rift units which develop in the hanging wall infill consist of basal units of turbiditic sandstones and overlying shales which are sometimes also capped by marine and coastal plain sandstones if the sediment supply is sufficient. Examples of this type of architecture are illustrated in the main rift units of Statfjord North and Gyda Fields. The Visund fault block and the Oseberg-Brage infill are examples from marine half-grabens which are near the central or axial zones of the northern North Sea rift complex, far from the main hinterland areas and show deepening upward trends into basinal shales. The syn-rift unconformity describes the erosion surface that bevels fault blocks during continental rifting. It develops locally over individual fault blocks because of footwall uplift and lithospheric unloading by extension. The syn-rift unconformity separates the rift from the following post-rift stage and, with the exception of faulted terrain, it is the most pronounced feature of rift basins. A northern North Sea example is in the Snorre Field where its crestal part was exposed to subaerial and subaqueous erosion during much of the late Jurassic and as much as 1 km of sediments has been removed in the northern part of the block. Other fault blocks in the North Sea, such as the Oseberg fault block, have rounded or flat tops resulting from erosion and peneplanation down to sea level. = Post-rift stage = Lithospheric extension and rift basin formation are followed by an asymptotically decreasing post-rift subsidence, caused by thermal contraction and relaxation of the heated crust. Such thermal subsidence typically spans about 100 Ma before thermal equilibrium is reached. This process typically occurs over a wider area than the original syn-rift subsidence, resulting in an elongated, saucer-shaped basing morphology and onlapping of post-rift strata against basin margins as well as onto remnant syn-rift topography. The major bounding faults of the northern North Sea palaeorift system, the East Shetland and Oygarden Fault Zones, are examples of such long-lived fault zones. In addition, the Viking Graben master faults bounding the East Shetland Platform to the west and the Horda Platform to the east acted as frontal shoulder faults during late Jurassic-early Cretaceous rifting. The early Cretaceous post-rift phase in the northern North Sea was characterized by slow subsidence, with much of the sedimentation accommodated by the infilling of previous rift bathymetry. At this time the shoulders of the rift were supported. During latest Cretaceous and Tertiary the shoulders lost their support, producing elongated, saucer-shaped basin and a 'steer's head' cross-sectional basin shape. Sediment architectures resulting from post- rift subsidence are generally much more simple than those produced during active stretching. Because maximum subsidence occur along the rift axis, post- rift successions tend to have a backstepping character. This is accentuated by a common decrease in sediment input as drainage basins become eroded and lose their significance. The gradual passage from continental coarse clastic sediments into shallow marine shales in the middle Triassic-lower Jurassic post-rift succession in the northern North Sea serves as a good example of such a model. During the Cretaceous, low-relief drainage areas are completely transgressed and the clastic supply is shut off. A return to clastic sedimentation is seen in the Tertiary post-rift filling of the North Sea which is related to compaction and external tectonics.

Biography Bayer was born in Augsburg. He was the son of a civil servant who died early. At age six, he became a member of the boys choir at the local St. Ulrich's church. In his youth, he was employed as an engraver and worked for the company for six years. A local municipal official named W. Schm√∂lzl introduced him to the guitar, giving him scores and tuition materials from Sor, Giuliani, Legnani, and Mertz. He gained such proficiency that by around 1843, he could give up his engraver's job and become a professional guitarist.Information combined from Bone (1914) and Zuth (1928); see Bibliography. In 1848, after a number of successful recitals in his hometown, he set out on a tour through Germany together with a certain Loe, one of his most talented pupils. Apparently, they were not successful and on the brink of returning home when at Darmstadt, their fate turned: \\"Having to pass through Darmstadt on their journey they were quite unexpectedly commanded to play before the court and they received genuine and hearty applause from the Hereditary Grand Duke and Duchess, the latter being a daughter of King Ludwig of Bavaria. Being now provided with weighty recommendations, they left the town which had provided them with such a pleasant surprise and from this time their success was assured.\\"Bone (1914), p. 24. He later travelled through many musical centres in Germany including Dresden and Leipzig and also through the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. After two years of travelling, he ended up in Hamburg in 1850, although he continued touring until 1857. For some of his publications, he used the pseudonym \\"A. Caroli\\", for example for his guitar method Vollst√§ndige Guitarreschule and his two collections of short pieces called Esmeralda. One of his most prominent pupils was Otto Hammerer (1834‚Äì1905). Bayer wrote mainly for the salon or for domestic entertainment. Among his numerous compositions are collections of 100 Erholungen (\\"recreations\\"), 21 volumes of Der Guitarrist im Salon (\\"the guitarist in the salon\\"), and 10 volumes of Musikalischer Blumenstraus (\\"musical bouquet\\"). In spite of his international tours and his method being translated into English and French, Bone (1914) wrote \\"Bayer is held in the highest estimation as a composer by his countrymen, but he is practically unknown out of Germany\\".Bone (1914), p. 25. He also composed songs for voice and guitar (mainly excerpts from popular operas), also some music for the zither and a fantasy for guitar and piano. He frequently performed on a harp guitar and was the inventor of a pedal harp guitar that was able to move a capodaster up and down the neck with the help of a foot pedal. Bayer died in Hamburg.

A review of the world's energy with different estimates indicates that the Middle East holds 55% to 68% of the world's oil deposits and more than 40% of the world's recoverable natural gas reserves. Worldwide, it is the richest side of the world in terms of hydrocarbon resources, both oil and gas reserves with an area of approximately 93000 square miles. The name Persian Gulf in most cases refers not only to the Persian Gulf but also the Gulf of Bahrain, the Gulf of Oman, and the Strait of Hormuz as well as various outlets that are linked to the Arabian Sea.  Tectonic evolution  Evolution of Arabian Plate tectonics from early Paleozoic to Late Permian and Triassic, showing Early Devonian ‚ÄúHercynian‚Äù compressional event and Early Zagros rifting event (usgs.gov) The Arabian Plate tectonic origin is grouped into six phases which contributed to its current geology: =The Precambrian phase = The early Precambrian (from 800 to 650 Ma) is a compressional phase where a series of islands-arcs and micro-continent terrane accreted to form the oldest portions of the Arabian Plate (Gondwana). The development of Hormuz saltbasin was a consequence of the last Precambrian orogenic event. =The Ordovician-Silurian glaciations = An expanding of polar glaciation in Gondwana occurred in the Late Ordovician, and later sea level rose in the Early Silurian was as a result of the deglaciation which led to extensive deposition of organic-rich shale that corresponds to a maximum flooding surface. This hot shale is considered the major source of Paleozoic hydrocarbon in Saudi Arabia..

Retrieved from the website: http://pubs.usgs.gov/bul/b2202-h/b2202-h.pdf = The Carboniferous phase = During the Late Devonian, the plate was located in a back-arc-setting. The initiation of the Hercynian Orogeny led to the uplift of the central Arabian plate and tilted it eastward, which resulted in a basement tectonism and extensive erosion. The Arabian Plate underwent many compressional phases during this period. = The early Triassic = Thermal subsidence and Arabian plate stretching (that resulted from the fragmentation of Gondwana in the Late Permian) resulted in extensional faulting and the early rifting of Zagros that opened the Neo-Tethys Sea. =Late Cretaceous phase (Early Alpine Orogeny) = This period was where the Alpine Orogeny started to form as a result of compression, which resulted in major uplifts and erosions, in addition to the closure of Neo-Tethys Sea. = The Tertiary phase (The Late Alpine Orogeny) = During this period there was the second Alpine Orogeny, which was as a result of the collision the Arabian and the Eurasian plates at the Mesozoic and Cenozoic border and this resulted in the formation of the Zagros Fold Belt together with the extensive Mesopotamian Foredeep and thus the formation of the foreland Persian basin. In addition to the opening of the Red Sea about ~25 Ma, which resulted in the separation of the African and the Arabian plates.  History of natural resources  Stratigraphic section, major tectonic events, and stratigraphic units that make up the Greater Paleozoic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous petroleum systems of the eastern Arabian Peninsula (USGS.gov) Total petroleum system events chart for Central Arabia (USGS.gov) The extensive oil and gas reserves of the Persian Gulf basin have a connection with the stable tectonic history. Over time, the Persian Gulf basin area has experienced continuous deposition that was consistent through the Paleozoic era and led to the initial accumulation of the carbonate rocks (which are excellent reservoir rocks) and evaporites (which play a big role as hydrocarbon seal rocks). The accumulation process was favored by the unique landscape and stable subsidence conditions which favored extensive deposition of carbonate rocks and evaporites which resulted in a thickness of ~12 to 13 km. Sediments and other deposits that came from the land were moved and then deposited at the bottom of the basin. Successive deposition and accumulation led to the creation of layers with an increased level of pressure as the processes progressed over time. After the deposition process, the increased pressure led to the breakdown of the organic material and consequently, the formation of the organic rich residue referred to as Kerogen. Continuous accumulation and increased pressure combined with heat are applied on the Kerogen which then transforms into either oil or gas.: Cairo to Doha. Persian Gulf at 13,000 m- A flooded basin. Retrieved from the website: Most of the oil in the Persian Gulf basin is produced from the Jurassic carbonates. However, presently, the rocks rich in organic hydrocarbons exist in three major geological systems: # The Paleozoic petroleum system. # The Jurassic petroleum system. # The Cretaceous petroleum system. Oil and gas are formed in a source rock (mostly shales), and then they migrate to the reservoir layer of rocks (carbonates). After that, the formation of structural folds and faults in the reservoir rocks leads to the natural creation of zones where the natural resources become trapped and stored as reserves that are commercially recoverable. Four major tectonic events resulted in the formation of structural traps: # The Carboniferous Hercynian Orogeny. # Early Triassic Zagros Rifting. # The First or Early Oman Alpine Orogeny. # The Second or Late Alpine Orogeny. which led to the collection and successive generations of the hydrocarbons after undergoing deformation and other processes that resulted in the final compartmentalization. In the middle Persian Gulf, large volumes of natural gas collections in Permo-Triassic accumulations have a direct link to the hot shale rocks found in the lower base-Silurian formation. Then the oil migrated to the carbonates reservoir rocks and finally was trapped in the four major traps, which explains why the Persian Gulf basin is one of the richest basins in terms of hydrocarbon resources.  Structural and tectonic settings  Arabian Plate showing general tectonic and structural features, Infracambrian rift salt basins, and oil and gas fields of Central Arabia and North Gulf area (usgs.gov) The Arabian Plate shows divergent margins around the adjacent areas of the Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and the south western side of the Arabian plate. On the south and south eastern side of the Arabian plate lies the Owen-Sheba which is an intra-oceanic transform fault. Then there is convergent margin located on the north and north eastern side close to Turkey and in the Zagros Mountains located on the east of Iran, where the Arabian plate is subducting underneath the Eurasian plate. Lastly the Dead Sea, which is a transform fault zone found on the north western side of the Arabian plate. The current deformation and accumulation processes that are related to the natural structures and the subsequent compression of the layers within the Persian Gulf illustrates the origin of the various natural resources found in the place, the geologic processes and the tectonic regimes that occurred.Digital Commons: University of Nebraska, Lincolin.

Web. 10 Feb. 2015. The end of the Paleozoic experienced some transformations in terms of subsidence differentiations and sea level rise that led to the formation of structural elements such as the three troughs: * The Arabian Trough Which is located in the middle part of the basin which is largely covered by Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. * The Gotnia Trough Which is in the northern side of the basin covering Iraq and Syria. * The Rub- Al-Khali Which is found in the Saudi Arabia and parts of United Arab Emirates. Most of the geological characteristics were established during the Paleozoic which were initiated by the continuous continental marine sedimentation on the north east side of Gondwana. Some complex events which were effects of the carboniferous processes also affected the area through creation of regional uplift, extensive erosions some basement tectonics. Therefore, the consistent tectonic geological evolution and the structural settings that resulted thereafter formed the Arabian plate after successive tectonic regimes.

The basin covers an area of about 175,000 km2 where the Pearl River meets the South China Sea near Hong Kong. Tectonic setting (South China Sea) The Tectonics of the South China Sea are complex. The South China Sea is a marginal sea located where the Eurasian plate, the Indo-Australian plate, and the Philippine Sea plate intersect. Extension began in the Late Cretaceous, along the location of an existing arc. U-Pb dating of arc volcanics from Hong Kong dated the end of magmatic activity around 140 Ma. However, 40Ar/39Ar dating of granites located in the Pearl River Mouth basin showed some magmatic activity continued into the Paleocene. Sea floor spreading then began in the South China Sea around 32 Ma and lasted until around 16 Ma propagating in a southwest direction. Although it is still unclear, two models have been proposed to explain the driving mechanism behind this extension. =Extrusion of Indochina= One model for extension proposes the opening of the South China Sea to be a result of southeast movement of Indochina and Borneo. This motion, along the Red River fault, is believed to have been instigated by the India/Asia collision. The collision caused an extrusion of Indochina relative to South China, which resulted in crustal extension and sea floor spreading. =Subduction under Borneo= Another model for extension identifies subduction of the southern margin of the South China Sea under Borneo. In this model, the displacement occurs along a major transform zone oriented north-south. This model also proposes that subduction under the Philippines to the north could have contributed to extension in the South China Sea. Diagram showing progression from rifting to sea floor spreading =Geologic setting (PRMB)= The PRMB formed along the continental margin of South China as a result of continental rifting and sea floor spreading in the South China Sea area. The PRMB consists of two areas of depression between three areas of uplift, all running mostly parallel to the spreading axis. Major structures within the PRMB are classified as half- graben, narrow grabens, or wide grabens. Basement rock in the central and northern portions of the PRMB are Cretaceous and Jurassic granites, Mesozoic sedimentary rocks in the east, and Paleozoic quartzite in the west. The crust in the PRMB thins from around 30 km near the coast in the north to around 11 km near the deep basin in the south. The crust also thins rapidly to less than 7 km underneath the Baiyun sag and to less than 9 km underneath the Liwan sag. =Sedimentation and stratigraphy= Syn-rift During rifting from the Late Cretaceous through the Early Oligocene, shallow lacustrine and fluvial to deltaic sediment was deposited in the PRMB. The sandy mudstone of the Shenhu formation was first deposited during the Paleocene and Early Eocene. Gray mudstones make up the Wrenching formation deposited in the Middle Eocene, with coal beds occurring near the top. Alternating layers of lacustrine and sandy mudstones were deposited as the Enping formation during the Late Eocene and Early Oligocene. This formation is capped by the breakup unconformity signifying the transition from syn- to post-rift around 32 Ma. Post- rift Post-rift sedimentation began with transitional sandstones and dark gray mudstones of the Zhuhai formation in the Late Oligocene. The PRMB has experienced deposition of marine sediment with fluctuating sea levels from the Miocene to present day. Today, terrigenous sediment input is mainly provided by the Pearl River, but during the Cenozoic other larger rivers likely contributed to sedimentation as well. =Subsidence analysis= Wells in the Pearl River Mouth basin have been studied to determine the subsidence history of the basin. Using backstripping methods, three separate rifting episodes were identified within the basin at 45-55 Ma, 45-25 Ma, and about 12-14 Ma with a fourth event at 5 Ma being identified in a single well. Most rifting in the basin was completed by 25 Ma, shortly after the time sea floor spreading began. Extension during rifting events was determined using McKenzie equations. Extension within the basin was determined to be greater than 48% at any given place based on uniform pure shear models and was mostly limited to before 25 Ma. Some extension (3-8%) also occurred after the main rifting phase, coinciding with more rapid sedimentation around 12 Ma. The presence of magmatism in the PRMB dating as recently as the Late Cretaceous-Early Paleocene indicates that the 80 My necessary to reach equilibrium in a plate following a tectonic or magmatic event had not yet been reached when rifting began in the basin. This timing implies that the lithosphere was hotter and weaker than equilibrium during the opening of the South China Sea and the formation of the PRMB. Forward modeling of the PRMB used elastic thickness (Te) values of 1‚Äì3 km to more closely reproduce basin geometries. Te values above 3 km could not produce basin geometries close enough to those observed. Œ≤ factors were calculated across cross section lines in the PRMB to represent extension in the basin. One cross section line across the PRMB found Œ≤=1.18 for the upper crust and Œ≤=1.4 for the entire crust. The differences in these values indicate a low viscosity for the lower crust during breakup. Regionally, Œ≤ values of the crust were also found to be less than Œ≤ values of the mantle. These findings indicate that uniform pure shear is not in effect in the PRMB. While some have suggested that the PRMB is on the upper plate in a simple shear model, findings in the conjugate margin, the Dangerous Grounds, also dispute this model. =Hydrocarbon exploration= The PRMB is a hydrocarbon-rich basin drawing interest from many energy companies, especially the area known as the Baiyun sag.

The Eocene Wrenching and Enping formations have proven to be major source rocks for the area with the dark mudstones deposited during that time.

Due to the intensive deformation occurring along the Caribbean and South American plates in this region, the basin has a unique structural and stratigraphic relationship. The Columbus Basin has been a prime area for hydrocarbon exploration and production as its structures, sediments and burial history provide ideal conditions for generation and storage of hydrocarbon reserves. The Columbus Basin serves as a depocenter for the Orinoco River delta, where it is infilled with 15 km of fluvio-deltaic sediment. The area has also been extensively deformed by series of north west to southeast normal faults and northeast to southwest trending anticline structures.  Location  The Columbus Basin makes up the eastern section of the EVB, occurring along the South American and Caribbean obliquely convergent plate margins. The East Venezuelan basin extends for approximately 1100 km wide where the Columbus Basin is most recent accounting for about 14,000 km¬≤ and is 15 Ma to 0 years in age. It is bounded by the Darien Ridge in the north (a continuation of the Central Range found on south western Trinidad) and the Delta Amacuro Platform to the south.  Tectonic history  Basic structural Map for the Columbus Basin, Trinidad The Columbus basin is Neogene in age and was formed by the oblique collision, from west to east, of the Caribbean plate and the South American plate. An easterly spreading centre in the Caribbean during the late Cretaceous led to the subduction of the Caribbean plate below the northern part of the South American plate. There was a transition during the Tertiary, from subduction to intense collision and deformation along the Caribbean and South American plates. The most intense deformation began in the early Miocene to Pleistocene. According to Garciacaro et al., the foreland basin was created by flexural subsidence at the passive margin of the colliding regions of the Caribbean and South American plates. The collision created loading of thrusts and folds which led to subsidence in the basin and contributed to the complex faulted and thrusted nature of the foreland basin formed. The Orinoco River delta has been the major source of siliciclastic sediments for the basin, with deposition within the basin beginning in the early Miocene. The Columbus basin is bounded by the Darien Ridge, part of the uplift region in the north west, which separates the thrusted area from the extended section to the southeast.  Structure  The two major structural features of the Columbus basin are a series of NW-SE, dipping to N-E, oriented faults and a series of NE-SW trending thrusts or anticlines. During the Pleistocene, the Columbus basin was divided into two sub-basins by the Columbus Channel Syncline. The dip in the northern sub-basin is to the south, while in the southern sub-basin is to the north. The faults are Pliocene to late Pleistocene in age and were developed as a result of sediment loading from the southwest. The get progressively younger from west to east and have throws as much as 3050m in some areas. The anticlines formed in association with the fault system as the normal faults cause extension, the sediments form rollover features (anticlines) along the NE dipping faults. Both the orientation of the fault and the fold axial traces of the antlicines are less than 45 degrees to the plate boundary, reaffirming the transpressional nature of the boundary.  Stratigraphy  Simple Stratigraphic Column for the Columbus Basin, Trinidad Most of the sediments within the Columbus basin are mainly sediments deposited in the paleo-Orinoco delta. These are thick Pleistocene to Pliocene deposits covering pre-Pliocene shales. The pre- Pliocene deposits, although not penetrated by wells in the basin, are thought to be Cretaceous marine facies deposited in self break extending west to east. A correlation of nearby onshore deposits supports the idea that the Miocene shales (maybe some Paleocene, Eocene and Oligocene deposits) underlie the Pleistocene to Pliocene units. This Miocene shale unit is considered a part of the Lower Cruse formation and is the source of the many shale diapirs that is found within the basin. The Cretaceous shale is also identified as the probable source rock for the Columbus basin. Based on the correlations presented in the paper by Leonard in 1983, the main stratigraphic units found overlying the Cretaceous shales in the Columbus basin are the Gros Morne, Mayaro, Palmiste and Erin Formation. From the bottom of the stratigraphic column of the basin, there is a general trend of the coarsening of sediment moving up the column. There are said to be three major regressive fluvio- deltaic sediment sequences within the stratigraphic column- the first within the late Miocene, the second regressive sequence in the middle Pliocene, and the third regressive sequence occurring in the mid to late Pliocene. Each regressive sequence is associated with the fall in sea level which led to the progradation of the delta further into the basin. There are coarser grained sands seen within these sections of the stratigraphic column. The major formations found within the basin are described below. = Gros Morne Formation = The Gros Morne Formation consists of Upper Miocene to Lower Pliocene clastic sedimentary sequences. It can be divided into three sections: Lower, Middle and Upper Gros Morne. The Lower Gros Morne corresponds to the first set of sediments being deposited into the basin as part of the proto- Orinoco delta. It is described from its correlation onshore Southwestern Trinidad as a deep marine shale section with coarsening upward to a shallow marine sand. The Middle Gros Morne is also known as the St. Hillaire silt indicates a regression consisting of silts interbedded with thin sands associated with middle to outer shelf environments. The Upper Gros Morne consists of a reservoir of the Columbus basin as this sedimentary unit is composed mostly of sand deposited in transitional-marine to terrestrial environment. = Mayaro Formation = The Mayaro Formation is the beginning of another regressive sequence. In the western part of the basin, the Mayaro Formation shifts from thick fine grained sands with alternating layers of silts and clays to a predominantly shale pro-delta unit. Due to how \\"clean\\" the layers of sand are, this layer is the most productive of the basin containing large accumulations of hydrocarbons that make up the larger producing fields in the basin including the Poui and Teak fields. = Palmiste Formation = The Palmiste Formation continues the regressive sequence started in the Mayaro Formation and is deposited in the late Pliocene. This formation shows a similar shift in sedimentary facies as the Mayaro formation. In the western part of the basin, there are thick, medium to fine grained sands with some interbedding with clay and silt, deposited in transitional-marine to terrestrial environment. In the eastern section of the basin, the sediments were deposited in deeper water and hence consisted of basal clay, coarsening upward into clays interbedded with fine grained sands. = Erin Formation = The Erin Formation is the most recent sequence deposited in the Pleistocene. The deposits consist of transitional marine in the west to shelf slope moving easterly. Currently, in the early Holocene, subsidence or possibly sea level rise of 100‚Äì200 feet contributed to deposits of a middle to outer neritic zone environment.  Relationship of sedimentation and tectonics  The Columbus basin has been greatly influenced by sedimentation and tectonic or structural features within the basin and in the surrounding areas. Sedimentation rates were extremely high in the Columbus basin reaching rates as much as 5 to 6 metres per 1000 yr on average for the entire basin with some depocenters reaching rates of 8 metres per 1000 yr. Most of the sediment supply having the most impact on the basin was deposited in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The regional extension that occurred as a result of the collision of Caribbean and South American plates was enhanced with the failure of normal faults due to the loading caused by increased sedimentation. These normal faults are part of a detachment that only reached the Upper Cretaceous to lower Miocene formations. As the paleo-Orinoco delta deposited sediments of clay and sand above these earlier formations, the sudden increased weight activated and increased the movement along these normal faults. Increase in sediment coupled with the low permeability of the Cretaceous shales underlying the paleo- Orinoco fluvio-deltaic sediments results in high hydrostatic pore fluid pressures within the Cretaceous shales which initiated their movement. As the Cretaceous shale underlies the Pliocene-Pleistocene sediment throughout the entire basin, the movement of shale and shale diapirs are widely common throughout the basin. The mobility of the shale diapirs were also influenced by the thrusting along faults on the Caribbean-South American Boundary and shortening of shale rich sediments of the Barbados accretionary prism.  Petroleum system  Map Showing the Major exploited Oil and Gas Field in Trinidad and Tobago The Columbus basin is one of the most important areas for hydrocarbon exploration in Trinidad and Tobago. The shelf and shelf edge are the primary hydrocarbon producing areas of the basin. Oil, gas and condensate make up the hydrocarbon resources found in the Plio-Pleistocene reservoirs of the basin. The generation of petroleum from the Lower Cruse formation is said to be of type II kerogen that is characterized by high oil to gas ratios. The gas to oil ratio of the thermogenic portion of the petroleum within the basin is 60‚Äì70% oil dominated in the NW of the basin and 90% gas dominated in the southeast. = Sources = The source of the hydrocarbons in the Columbus basin is believed to be the shales of the Miocene Lower Cruse Formation and possibly those of the Upper Cretaceous. = Migration = The NE-SW trending extensional faults that developed as a result of the convergent margin and loading provide pathways for the movement of the hydrocarbon from the Miocene shales to the fluvio-deltaic Orinoco Delta sands of the Pliocene-Pleistocene. = Reservoir = The reservoirs are the \\"cleaner\\" sands of the deltaic sandstones of the Late Miocene to early Pliocene-Pleistocene sequences. = Traps = The anticline structures that formed as the basin extended and with the activation of normal faults as sediment load increased, act as traps for the hydrocarbons. The faults also can act as traps as well. = Seals = The seals are the Pleistocene shales of the paleo-Orinoco delta sequences that are interbedded with the medium to fine grained sand reservoirs.

Uplift and loading of the Eurasian plate on to the Indian plate resulted in the flexure (bending) of the Indian plate, and the creation of a depression adjacent to the Himalayan mountain belt. This depression was filled with sediment eroded from the Himalaya, that lithified and produced a sedimentary basin ~3 to >7 km deep. The foreland basin spans approximately in length and in width. From west to east the foreland basin stretches across five countries: Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. The Himalayan foreland basin has been studied within the Himalaya (where the foreland basin succession has been uplifted and exposed in the Sub- Himalaya and Lesser Himalaya), and in the subsurface (where petroleum exploration wells and seismic data are used). The foreland basin fill traces back to the onset development of the foreland basin which started during the Paleogene period around 45 - 50 Ma . Deposition in the foreland basin appears to be diachronous; a lag in time exists between parts of the basin. The western extreme of the basin started developing during the Paleocene around 57-54 Ma, the central central portion began developing <2 Ma later, and the basin gets younger as it progresses towards the east. The stratigraphic succession of the basin is important as it preserves the sedimentary record of India-Eurasia collision.  Geologic Setting  During the Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic, the Indian plate drifted northward a vast distance resulting in the closure of the Neo-Tethys Ocean. Approximately 40-50 million years ago remnants of the ocean vanished as India collided with the Eurasian plate. As the continental plates are relatively low density they cannot be subducted. This results in the Eurasian plate being thrusted up leading to the rise of the Tibetan Plateau, bounded to the south by the collisional Himalayan mountain range. The Himalayan foreland basin is adjacent to the Himalayan mountain belt; it laps onto the Indian Craton to the south and is bounded by stacked thrust sheets of the Himalayas to the north. The foreland basin, much like the Himalayan mountain range, spans approximately west to east across Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. The actively subsiding foreland basin lies beneath the Punjab region of Pakistan and the Gangetic plain of India and southernmost Nepal.  Basin Subdivisions  The Himalayan foreland basin has been divided on the basis of modern drainage divides, and subsurface topography. Subdivisions based on drainage divides are most commonly used, with the Indus Basin reflecting the drainage area of the Indus River, and the Ganga Basin representing the drainage area of the Ganges River. The basin overlies a series of Indian Plate depressions and ridges, that have also been used to subdivide the foreland basin. The rock units that make up the Indian plate vary dramatically along the length of the basin, changing from Proterozoic Mobile Belt rocks, to Archean Craton, and Proterozoic Vindhyan Supergroup sedimentary rocks. These Indian Plate rock units extend under the foreland basin and have been correlated to a series of depressions and ridges underneath the foreland basin. As the Indian plate has flexed (bent) under the Eurasian plate, the depressions and ridges have acted as flexible and stiff areas respectively, influencing the thickness of the foreland basin fill.  Stratigraphy  The Himalayan foreland basin has been divided into different rock units in different parts of the basin. The earliest deposits of the foreland basin are marine mudstones, which are unconformably overlain by continental deposits. Neogene and Quaternary continental deposits make up the vast majority of the foreland basin fill. The stratigraphy of the foreland basin is best known from studies of uplifted strata in the Lesser and Sub- Himalaya, supplemented by data from the small amount of wells that test the hydrocarbon potential of the foreland basin drilled in India and Nepal. = Subathu/Bhainskati/Kohat Formations - Earliest Foreland Basin Fill = The Subathu formation containing predominantly of shales and minor amounts of sand. Field picture taken close to the city of Simia, India.The Paleogene Subathu Formation of India (correlative to the Bhainskati Formation of Nepal, and the Kohat Formation of Pakistan) represents the oldest known foreland basin deposits, and unconformably overlies older strata. The Subathu Formation and equivalents are relatively thin intervals (<150 m) predominantly composed of fossiliferous, organic-rich black shale. These units are interpreted as shallow marine deposits. Marine to shallow marine facies in the form of shales and minor amounts of sand also consists of predominantly green mudstone with minor red facies and were dated back to the upper paleocene to lower mid eocene period based on the existence of Nummulites gathered from biostratigraphical data. petrographic interpretation of the green Subathu Formation were shown to be predominantly sedimentary with minor traces of serpentine schist input. Although the red facies shows a more felsitic and of volcanic origins, it entails that it originates from continental flood basalts of the Indian craton. The Subathu Formation was interpreted to be a preservation of the intense collision between the two plates in the western part of the foreland basin that leads to thrusting. An evidence of a silicified chert breccia strata existing just on top of the rigid precambrian basement was interpreted as a growth fault that developed as a result of compressional tectonics. The thrust slices in the sub-himalayan ranges now preserves some of the Subathu Formation. Although a debate has arise, it is inferred that some locations where the Subathu Formation is exposed are now considered to be the forebulge of the foreland basin as it is overlain by a much younger formation where a time hiatus or an unconformity has occurred. A time hiatus of an approximately 10 MA are inferred based on thermochronology and magnetostratigraphy between the Subathu and the overlying formation, but it is highly controversial. = Dagshai/Dharamsala/Dumre Formations - Earliest Continental Depositis = Field photo of the Dagshai formation exposed in the town of Palampur, North India.The Dagshai Formation has been dated back to the Oligocene-Miocene Epoch where it consists of primarily fine grained material of alluvial origins. The Dagshai is distinctive by its red color consisting of mostly red mudstone, siltstone and grey sandstone. It is the oldest continental deposits and overlies the Subathu formation. A debate has arise of whether the Dagshai Formation overlies conformably or unconformably on top of the Subathu formation. recent research by dating detrital micas and fission track dating of detrital zircons shows conclusively that there is an unconformable nature between the Subathu and Dagshai Formation. Magnetostratigraphic data suggests that the Daghsai formation was deposited at approximately 27 Ma with 2 Ma uncertainty. Previously, multiple studies of facies interpretation of the Dagshai formation has been conducted with varying results regarding the past depositional environment; the presence of quartzitic sandstones was thought to be leftovers of an extensive and prolonged weathering in alluvial plains in which time tropical weathering was intensifying. The study by Yani Najman et al. interpreted that the Dagshai is a result of crevasse play and overbank floodplain facies because of an abundance of fine grained material; The general setting of the Dagshai Formation was concluded to be a past alluvial environment. = Siwalik Group - The Thickest Record of Himalayan Detritus = Field photo of the Siwalik sandstone complex taken in the city of Jawalamukhi, Northern India.The Siwalik Group is a coarsening upward siliciclastic succession that makes up the thickest accumulation of detritus derived from the Himalaya in the foreland basin. The deposits are continental, and largely reflect deposition in floodplain, meandering river, and braided river environments. The Siwalik Group has been informally divided into the Upper, Middle, and Lower Siwalik since the early 1900's based on vertebrate fossil markers. Numerous researchers have broken the Siwalik Group into formations at different locations along the Himalaya, but these formations are local-scale, and cannot be correlated regionally. Boundaries of the Siwalik Group are diachronous, as they have been constrained to different times at different locations along the Himalaya. Because these boundaries are diachronous, it would be incorrect to assign a single specific age to the top or bottom of each subdivision.  Lower Siwalik  The Lower Siwalik is the base of the Siwalik Group. Deposition of the Lower Siwalik started in the Middle Miocene. The Lower Siwalik is characterized by alternating facies of sandstone and mudstone, deposited in fluvial and floodplain environments. Paleosol deposits are commonly interlayered with sandstone lenses on the scale of >1 m to 10 m. The Lower Siwalik is conformably overlain by the Middle Siwalik.  Middle Siwalik  The Middle Siwalik was deposited from the upper Miocene to the Pliocene. This unit is dominated by sandstone beds, punctuated by thin mudstone to siltstone horizons. The sediment supply for the Middle Siwalik originated from the main provenance of the rising Himalayas. With vertical facies variation from sandstone-mudstone to sandstone-mudstone-conglomerate with a thickness approximately . The unique part of this multistorey sand complex is the fact that it is underlain by a major erosional surface which extends laterally for hundreds of meters. individual stories vary in thickness and are recognized by the presence of intra and extra-formational clasts along the base of each storey. These facies assemblages suggests a deposition by sheet floods in a braided channel environment. The vertical stacking of this multistorey sandstone complex further indicates of a channel bar that migrates with channels existing predominantly as depositional sites. The Middle Siwalik is conformably overlain by the Upper Siwalik.  Upper Siwalik  The Pliocene to Quaternary Upper Siwalik is interpreted as the sedimentary record of the last phase of Himalayan orogeny. The Upper Siwalik predominantly consists of conglomerate facies in its upper layers and alternations of sandstone, mudstone and conglomerate in the lower part with a maximum thickness of . The Upper Siwalik is overlain by unlithified Quaternary sediments such as the Neogal conglomerate and red clays. The basal part of the Upper Siwalik shows predominantly of crudely stratified conglomerate, sandstone and massive mudstone which suggests a deposition of high energy conditions; this facies assemblage and characteristics are commonly found in gravel transport fans and suggests a deposition by gravelly braided rivers in medial to distal alluvial fan settings.  Basin evolution  Continental collision process between the drifting Indian plate and the Eurasian plate starting at 60 Ma. Original video courtesy of Tanya Atwater and Peter Molnar. More information regarding the video can be found at http://www.geol.ucsb.edu/faculty/atwater/ = Initial collision and onset of the foreland basin development = The Paleocene epoch marked the initial time of the India-Eurasia collision. Based on paleomagnetic records, around the time of 55-50 Ma the velocity of the Indian Plate decreased rapidly and is followed by a sequence of thrusts and compressional tectonics between the two plates which then triggered the development of the Himalayan Mountain belt. It is believed that the initial collision occurred close to the equator where deposits of bauxite is found within the stratigraphy of the foreland basin overlying a silicified chert breccia strata existing on the pre-existing basement of the basin. The chert breccia strata was interpreted as a growth fault in the fold thrust belt as a result of compressional tectonics. With the collision being an active ongoing process, it progressively generates weight which resulted a downward flexing of the subducting Indian plate and created an accommodation space to be filled with sediments. The flexural subsidence of the basin is slow as a result of the hard and rigid precambrian basement making a relatively shallow foreland basin. Topographic load exerted from the developing Himalayan mountain range results in the downward flexing of the Indian Plate. Modified from Egan and Williams, Dept. of Earth sciences, Keele University = Active convergence = During the Eocene epoch the ongoing process of an active convergence between the two plates increased crustal thickening and further increased the load that originated from the Himalayan mountain belt. From Eocene to early Miocene time, thrusts and uplifts are occurring at the Himalayan zone. The initial development of the foreland basin indicated from the oldest marine deposits in the existing stratigraphy shows the basinal subsidence was shallow as a result of the rigid precambrian basement coupled with a slow rate of sedimentation and sediment starvation. The Eocene period also marked the onset of a shift from marine facies deposits on to fluvial deposits stratigraphically. Continued motion of the Indian plate after the India-Asia collision further led the focus of the deformation of the Indian plate across of the marginal area of the Indian Shield. This type of event has resulted in intracontinental shortening. Major intracontinental shear associated with the Central Crystalline Zone has been also been recognized. = Climate change and erosion = The Oligocene-Miocene boundary has an important effect on the structure of the basin. Carbon Isotope data and Pollen analysis indicates of a climatic change around SE Asia which significantly increases humidity of the region. From this, reconstruction of monsoonal records was established and it is inferred that around 24-20 Ma is the time when the monsoon intensified. The intensification of the monsoon also resulted in intensification of erosion around the Himalayas. This erosion then caused a reduction in mass of the Himalaya which made the foreland basin partly invert, rebound, and essentially uplift. This is supported by the discovery of the older marine deposition of the Subathu formation in parts of the thrust slices in sub-Himalayas, at a high elevation than it would normally be found.  Hydrocarbon potential  Despite the presence of gas seeps along the Himalaya, and over 70 years of hydrocarbon exploration, no commercially viable hydrocarbon fields have produced from the foreland basin succession. Exploration wells have been drilled in the Indian, Pakistani, and Nepalese portions of the basin. Most of the drilled wells intersecting the Siwalik Group (Upper, Middle, and Lower Siwalik) indicate poor source rock potential. Organically-rich Subathu Formation samples in the form of coal show total organic content levels up to 80%, suggesting the Subathu Formation (and correlative units) may have source rock potential. Despite the high TOC levels, the coals exhibit low hydrogen index which indicates the potential to only form gaseous hydrocarbons. Furthermore, it is assumed that the gaseous hydrocarbon potential by them may have been lost by tectonic events that occurred in the basin. This is evident by palynological rock study that further indicates of more than 96% of the samples taken from the Subathu Formation was organically lean. Exploratory wells for hydrocarbon exploration were also drilled in the town Jawalamukhi. Although the discovery of gas seepages around this area was recorded, currently it does not hold any commercial value to be produced.  Active Deformation of the Foreland Basin  Himalayan deformation was previously thought to stop at the foot of the Himalaya, or the northern boundary of the foreland basin (the Main Frontal Thrust). The Himalayan foreland basin was thus thought to be undeformed. Himalayan deformation has been shown to extend into the subsurface of the foreland basin, in the form of blind thrust faults, and strike-slip faults. These faults reach over 37 km south of the Main Frontal Thrust, and are responsible for several modern-day topographic highs. Active deformation of the foreland basin has only been mapped in one area of Nepal, but may be present in other regions.

The Murray Ridge separates the two basins. The offshore Indus basin is approximately 120 to 140 kilometers wide and has an areal extent of ~20,000 square km. Location map of the Offshore Indus Basin, Pakistan Tectonic setting =Basin formation= The offshore Indus basin is a rift and passive margin basin which developed following the separation of the Indian Plate from Africa in the late Jurassic. During the Late Cretaceous, the separation of Madagascar from India occurred and was followed by rapid northward movement of the Indian plate. In the early Paleocene, the Indian plate passed over the Reunion hotspot. This event also led to the extrusion of large volcanic rocks, known as the Deccan Traps. During the Eocene, the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate, uplifting the Himalayas. Presence of the Middle Eocene sandstones in the distal Indus fan, which contain feldspar grains with an origin in or north of the Indus suture zone, is an evidence to the occurrence of this event. The Indian plate continues to collide with the Eurasian plate as shown by earthquakes in and around the Himalayas. Seismic data in the offshore Indus basin show evidence of an early rift geometry below the Deccan volcanics. Imaging is hampered by the presence of volcanics, which partly infill the rifts and by the thick overlying Indus Fan section of Oligocene to Recent age. The precise age of the rifts is unknown but is interpreted as most likely a mid-Cretaceous to Paleocene age and associated with the break up of the Madagascar/Seychelles/Indo-Pakistan plate. During the early post-rift phase, attached carbonate platforms of Paleocene and early Eocene age formed along the continental margin and detached platforms on volcanic seamounts within the basin. Between the carbonate banks, coeval pelagic sediment was deposited in the intervening structural lows. As the Indian plate drifted northwards away from the Reunion mantle hotspot, the basin subsided rapidly. This was accompanied by major clastic influx from the Indus river and leading to deposition of up to 9 km of Oligocene to Recent sediments. =Crustal structure and tectonic elements= Seismic and gravity data suggest that the underlying crust in the offshore Indus basin is of three types: continental, transitional and oceanic. Continental crust is interpreted for the area below the shelf and upper slope based on the presence of deep rift geometries on seismic lines. Transitional crust occurs on the slope in water depths of 1500‚Äì3000 m and is characterized by a prominent gravity low and a northeast- southwest-trending chain of seamounts of Late Cretaceous-Paleocene age. Crust in this region is interpreted to represent thinned continental crust which has been subsequently thickened by the intrusion of thick volcanic rocks by the process of igneous underplating. Further basinwards, the transitional crust is replaced by the oceanic crust characterized by a prominent gravity high and a well-imaged Moho reflection on seismic lines. The northwest of the Murray ridge is a major plate boundary transform fault which formed in the Late Oligocene/Early Miocene in response to plate reorganization following the opening of the Gulf of Aden. Onlap of the Miocene and younger stratigraphy on the southeast side of the ridge confirms the age of the ridge and resultant hanging wall uplift. Motion along the Murray ridge bounding fault has resulted in the development of northwest-southeast-trending faults, folds and shale diapirs in the hanging wall. The Makran accretionary wedge, north of the Murray ridge, developed in response to the subduction of the Gulf of Oman oceanic crust beneath Eurasia from about 14 Ma onwards. The southern boundary of the offshore Indus basin is marked by the Saurashtra Arch. It is a volcanic high which extends eastwards into onshore India, coinciding with large outcrop of Deccan volcanics. In the offshore, the arch is cut by steep vertical faults interpreted as extensional faults associated with strike-slip movement along an east-west-trending transform fault marking the northern edge of the Arabian Sea oceanic crust. Two other features have been identified southeast of the Saurashtra Arch, the Laxmi Ridge and the Laxmi Basin. The Laxmi Ridge is interpreted as continental fragment and the Laxmi Basin is considered to be an area of extended continental crust respectively. The gravity and seismic data suggest that the Laxmi Ridge may represent an area of thinned continental crust which has been subsequently thickened by igneous underplating and the intrusion of thick volcanics similar to the transitional area in the offshore Indus basin. =Stratigraphy and sedimentation= Basin stratigraphy Stratigraphy of the Offshore Indus Wells drilled on the continental shelf of the offshore Indus basin have been drilled down to Cretaceous rocks. The oldest formation penetrated is the Sembar Formation of Early Cretaceous. It is composed of shales. Onshore Sembar Formation is the major source rock, responsible for charging the sands of the Goru Formation. Sembar is overlain by Goru Formation. Goru is subdivided into Lower and Upper Goru. Lower Goru is sandy onshore and a proven reservoir. Offshore, however, it shales out. Upper Goru is a massive shale and was deposited during Late Cretaceous. It is overlain by Parh Limestone, Mughalkot (limestone interbedded with shale) and Pab Sandstone Formations, deposited during Late Cretaceous. Deccan volcanics of the Paleocene overlie the Cretaceous Pab Sandstone. These are overlain by Ranikot Formation (majorly sandstone), also Paleocene in age. Eocene carbonates, Ghazij/Kirthar lie on top of the Paleocene Ranikot Formation. Nari (Oligocene in age), Gaj (Miocene) and recent sediments, were brought down by the Indus river after the Himalayan uplift and deposited over the Eocene carbonates. The Indus fan and its channel-levee systems The Indus Fan One of the most significant depositional feature of the offshore Indus basin is the Indus Fan. It is the second largest fan system in the world after the Bengal fan between India, Bangladesh and the Andaman Islands. The Indus fan was deposited in an unconfined setting on the continental slope, rise and basin floor, covering much of the Arabian Sea. The entire fan extends over an area of 110,000 square kilometers with greater than 9 km of sediment accumulating near the toe-of-slope. Fan sedimentation is estimated to have begun at the end of the Oligocene or beginning of the Miocene, during a period of faster Himalayan exhumation, possibly linked to Monsoon intensification. Cartoon sketch of a deep sea fan channel-levee system (CLS) The upper Indus Fan, both ancient and recent, consists some of the largest channel-levee systems (CLS). These channel-levee systems act as conduits for carrying and depositing sediments into the deeper part of the basin. The coarser grained sediments are deposited in the channel belts whereas the finer grained silts and clays are deposited along the levees. This arrangement of sediments is ideal for stratigraphic plays and that is why these channel-levee systems are of utmost importance to the petroleum industry. =Hydrocarbon potential= The offshore Indus basin is significantly under-explored. To-date only 12 wells have been drilled in the offshore Indus basin, out of which only 3 were drilled in the deep sea. All of these have been unsuccessful attempts. Some of these wells encountered high pressures in the Miocene section. Gas shows and non-commercial gas quantities were also reported in the Miocene strata of most wells. As far as the petroleum system is concerned, presence and effectiveness of the reservoir and trap are of low risk. The channel and sheet sandstones of Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene are good potential reservoirs. Oligocene clastic rocks can also act as reservoir rocks in distal fan facies. Four types of traps have been identified in offshore Indus: an extensional rollover anticline trend in the upper slope, drape structures over the Eocene carbonate banks and seamounts, stratigraphic traps formed by sands pinching out against the Murray Ridge and folds associated with the Murray Ridge shear faults and shale diapirs. Presence of seal may be an issue in some areas due to erosional channels. The source rock is questionable, as Sembar Formation, which is a proven source onshore, is too deep offshore and most likely overmature to charge the reservoirs. Paleocene-Eocene carbonates can be the potential source rocks in the offshore Indus basin. However, this needs to be proved in terms of both quality and quantity.

After traveling downriver via flatboat to New Orleans, he arrived with his company in Veracruz in January 1848. In February, he took part in skirmishes in the Orizaba area, and helped escort General William G. Belknap from Veracruz to the National Bridge (en route to Mexico City). In April 1848, he was appointed hospital steward at Veracruz by Dr. Barclay McGhee, a prominent Monroe County physician who was serving as a military surgeon. He later wrote that he helped alleviate an outbreak of yellow fever by using a water cure that his uncle had taught him. He was discharged in July 1848.Richard M. Edwards, Stewart Lillard (ed.), Down the Tennessee: The Mexican War Reminisciences of an East Tennessee Volunteer (Loftin and Company, 1997; originally published in the Knoxville Tribune, 1895). After the war, Edwards studied law under Samuel A. Smith, and was admitted to the bar. He married Mary Lucinda Craigmiles in 1851,\\"Married,\\" Athens Post, 21 November 1851, p. 3. and commenced the practice of law in Cleveland, initially specializing in \\"legal affairs for soldiers.\\"Athens Post, 23 August 1850, p. 3.

As the secession crisis intensified in 1861, he remained committed to the Union, and endorsed his district's Unionist congressional candidate, George W. Bridges, in March of that year.Athens Post, 22 March 1861, p. 3. Edwards was a delegate to the Knoxville and Greeneville sessions of the pro-Union East Tennessee Convention in May and June 1861, and represented Bradley County on the Convention's powerful business committee at both sessions.Thomas William Humes, Loyal Mountaineers of Tennessee (Overmountain Press, 1998; originally published in 1888), pp. 109, 115‚Äì116. While in Greeneville, Edwards made a pact with several other Convention delegates, including Joseph A. Cooper and Robert K. Byrd, to return to their respective homes and raise and drill companies for military service.Oliver Perry Temple, Mary Boyce Temple (ed.), \\"Joseph A. Cooper,\\" Notable Men of Tennessee (Cosmopolitan Press, 1912), p. 104. In August 1861, Edwards was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives seat for Bradley County. Since the state had seceded and joined the Confederacy, Edwards and several other Unionist members of the legislature‚Äîincluding John M. Fleming, Robert H. Hodsden, and Dewitt Clinton Senter‚Äîwere required to take the Confederate oath of allegiance in order to take their seats. He remained with the legislature until February 1862, when the Union Army's capture of Nashville forced the state government to flee. In March 1862, he joined the commissary of the Union Army's First Tennessee Regiment, led by fellow East Tennessee Convention delegate General James G. Spears.James Alex Baggett, Homegrown Yankees: Tennessee's Union Cavalry in the Civil War (LSU Press, 2009).\\"Richard M. Edwards,\\" The Reports of Committees of the House of Representatives for the First Session of the Fifty-second Congress (U.S. Government Printing Office, 1892), Report No. 109. Commissioned by Tennessee's military governor Andrew Johnson to raise a cavalry regiment, Edwards spent the Spring of 1862 recruiting soldiers and acquiring horses and other supplies for what would initially be known as the First East Tennessee Cavalry. By July he had recruited over 400 men, including future congressman Jacob Montgomery Thornburgh (who was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the regiment) and Sevier County sheriff and bridge burner William C. Pickens. In September, Edwards and his burgeoning regiment marched with General George W. Morgan from the Cumberland Gap area to Greenup, Kentucky, on the Ohio River.Alexander Eckel, History of the Fourth Tennessee Cavalry (Overmountain Press, 1929), pp. 16-18, 27-28. After he and Pickens quarreled over who should command the regiment, Pickens and several of the recruits split off in hopes of forming their own regiment. In November, the First East Tennessee was transferred to the Army of the Cumberland and ordered to Louisville, Kentucky, where Edwards continued to recruit men from among the East Tennessee Unionist refugees who were flocking to the area. The competition among the new regiments for recruits was intense. At one point, Governor Johnson's son, Robert Johnson, who was commanding one of the new regiments, was placed under house arrest for enticing 125 men away from Edwards' regiment. In January 1863, Edwards and his regiment were ordered to Nashville. Here, they engaged primarily in drilling and performing scouting operations. To avoid confusion with an infantry division that had previously been promised conversion to cavalry as soon as horses became available, the First East Tennessee was redesignated the Fourth Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry. On July 6, 1863, Edwards resigned his command of the Fourth Tennessee. Several factors had converged to force his resignation. First, he had yet to take the oath of allegiance, which required Union Army officers to swear they had never served in the Confederate government (Edwards had taken the Confederate oath in order to take his seat in the state legislature in late 1861). Furthermore, several Union Army commanders had grown skeptical of Edwards after he endorsed a speech by New York congressman Sunset Cox that criticized President Abraham Lincoln's war policy. Finally, Edwards' ability to command was questioned after he became embroiled in an internal quarrel with a regimental surgeon. After resigning, Edwards continued to recruit men, hoping at some point to reassume command of the Fourth. Postwar politics During the years following the Civil War, Edwards supported the allies of President Andrew Johnson‚Äîcommonly called \\"Conservatives\\"‚Äîwho sought more lenient measures toward former Confederates.\\"Meigs County,\\" Nashville Union and Dispatch, 7 April 1867, p. 1.\\"State Items,\\" Memphis Daily Appeal, 30 June 1867, p. 1. He spoke out against the policies of Tennessee's Radical Republican postwar governor, William G. Brownlow, specifically Brownlow's \\"franchise\\" laws aimed at preventing former Confederates from voting. At a Conservative rally in Athens, Tennessee, in March 1867, Edwards called for armed resistance to the franchise laws, and was arrested for making \\"insurrectionary and treasonable speech.\\"\\"The Traitors, Outlaws, Vagabonds and Scoundrels of McMinn County,\\" Knoxville Whig, 27 March 1867, p. 2.\\"Free Speech Suppressed in East Tennessee,\\" Memphis Public Ledger, 18 May 1867, p. 2.

Following the enaction of the new state constitution in 1870, Edwards ran for district attorney general, but was defeated by A.J. Trewhitt.\\"Bradley County,\\" Knoxville Chronicle, 10 August 1870, p. 1. In 1878, Edwards ran for governor on the populist Greenback ticket. During this period, the dominant issue in state politics was over how to manage the state's out-of-control debt, much of which had been accrued due to railroad construction. Edwards blamed railroad bondholders for the debt, going so far as to accuse them of plundering the state treasury, and calling for the state to invalidate railroad bonds.\\"Joint Discussion,\\" Memphis Public Ledger, 14 September 1880, p. 1. A Knoxville Chronicle reporter who interviewed Edwards during this period noted, \\"he chews the stump of his cigar as if he had a bondholder between his teeth, or a railroad magnate, and wished to crush every bit of life out of them.\\"\\"A Talk With the Candidates,\\" Knoxville Chronicle, 22 July 1880, p. 4. In the election, he placed a distant third, winning just 15,155 votes to 89,958 for the victorious Democratic candidate, Albert S. Marks, and 42,284 for the Republican, Eli Wight.Tennessee Blue Book (1890), p. 170. Edwards once again ran for governor on the Greenback ticket in 1880. He expressed disappointment over how Marks had managed the debt issue, and accused Marks of allowing the state's workers to be \\"plundered by soulless corporations.\\"\\"Greenbackers,\\" Memphis Daily Appeal, 2 July 1880, p. 4. He managed to win just 3,459 votes, however, well behind the Republican candidate, Alvin Hawkins (103,964 votes), the \\"state credit\\" Democrat, John V. Wright (73,783), and the \\"low tax\\" Democrat, S.F. Wilson (57,080). Edwards opted against a third bid for governor in 1882, instead endorsing the Democratic candidate, William B. Bate.\\"Fresh Recruits for General Bate,\\" Memphis Public Ledger, 17 October 1882, p. 2.\\"And Still They Come!\\" Morristown (TN) Gazette, 18 October 1882, p. 2.

These included a multipart series on his Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War experiences, which appeared in the Knoxville Tribune in the mid-1890s, and has since been edited and republished as a book, Down the Tennessee: The Mexican War Reminisciences of an East Tennessee Volunteer, by historian Stewart Lillard. Edwards also wrote the chapter, \\"Bradley County and the Town of Cleveland, Tennessee,\\" for the 1893 book, East Tennessee: Historical and Biographical.

Rifting between the North and South American plates continued in the Early-Jurassic, approximately 160 million years ago, and formation of the Gulf of Mexico, including subsidence due to crustal thinning, was complete by 140 Ma. Stratigraphy of the basin, which can be split into several regions, includes sediments deposited from the Jurassic through the Holocene, currently totaling a thickness between 15 and 20 kilometers. Tectonics =Pangaea= Beneath the sediments of the Gulf of Mexico basin, most of the pre-Triassic basement rocks are believed to be allochthonous thrust sheets sutured during the formation of Pangaea. However, it was during the break-up of the supercontinent that the foundation for the Gulf of Mexico sediments would be laid. Prior to the rifting which formed the Gulf of Mexico basin, extensional deformation in the Late-Triassic caused by the breakup up of Pangaea, and more specifically the rifting of the Atlantic Ocean, created basement graben formations which filled with terrestrial red bed sediments, and volcanic sediments from the eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Plume. The plume erupted 60,000 cubic kilometers of flood basalts over ancestral North and South America, Africa and parts of Europe. In addition to the basalt flows, other important igneous rock types include diabases associated with the grabens and red beds, and overlapping, north-northwest trending dike swarms related to the tectonic volcanism of the breakup of Pangaea. =Early to mid-Jurassic= Separation of the North and South American Plates in the Early-Mid Jurassic beginning with the rotation of the Yucatan Block, along with changes in sea level and thermal activity from the active rift, created a shallow marine basin wherein thick Jurassic salts and evaporites could be deposited. These evaporites overlay a thick transitional crust, the local basement rock prior to rifting, and deposition of salts continued over the forming oceanic crust as rifting spread the sea floor throughout the Jurassic. It was during the Jurassic, approximately 140‚Äì160 million years ago, that the shape of the Gulf of Mexico as we know it was formed. The unique shape of the Gulf of Mexico, surrounded on all sides by continental crust, is the result of two different tectonic boundaries: an ocean-continent transform boundary, and a magmatic plume fueled seafloor spreading center active contemporaneously in regards to geologic time. The transform boundary caused two approximately 22¬∞ counterclockwise rotations of the Yucatan Block away from the North American plate. One rotation happened prior to seafloor spreading, and the second rotation happened while the basin spread, creating the current geographical shape of the Gulf of Mexico and the current placement of the Yucatan Peninsula. Simple animation depicting the opening of the Gulf of Mexico The active rifting of the Late-Triassic to Mid- Jurassic, and the stratigraphy which depended strongly on that tectonic development, is followed by a relatively calm tectonic period in the Late- Jurassic. The Late-Jurassic Gulf of Mexico is characterized mostly by prolonged subsidence in the central region, as well as heavy sedimentation around the Florida Platform and Northern Gulf of Mexico. =Late Jurassic through the Cretaceous= While a few intrusive igneous formations found as far south as Mexico City are dated to the Late-Jurassic or Early Cretaceous, the Gulf of Mexico during that time was relatively devoid of igneous activity. It wasn't until the Late Mesozoic that low-volume yet widespread volcanism occurred along the Western and Northwestern margins of the Gulf of Mexico, leaving the Yucatan Peninsula with an extremely alkali volcanic field in the subsurface. The volcanism is believed to have been activated along ancient plate boundaries weakened by the loading of sediments in the Gulf. =Sedimentation and stratigraphy= Pre-rift As mentioned above, the pre-rift stratigraphy of the central Gulf of Mexico basin, which now lies beneath nearly 20 kilometers of sediment deposited during the Jurassic through the Holocene, is made up primarily of extensional graben formations filled with \\"red beds,\\" basalt flows, and diabase dikes and sills deposited and intruded during the break-up of Pangaea and the explosion of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Plume. Red beds, also referred to as non-marine clastic sequences, which are often red in color, have been found in wells drilled in the Gulf of Mexico which penetrated the Late-Triassic and Early-Jurassic strata, filling the extensional graben features. The Gulf of Mexico basin red beds are specifically named the Eagle Mills formation, located directly beneath the salt, evaporite and marine sediments deposited during the Jurassic, and often found with the diabase dikes and basalt flows mentioned above. Basement rocks in the northeastern region of the Gulf of Mexico basin are fragments of the African plate which remained behind during the breakup of Pangaea and date back to the late Precambrian through the Cambrian. It is atop these Precambrian plate fragments that the mainly carbonate and evaporite sediments deposited after the opening of the Gulf of Mexico has become the Florida Platform. Early-mid Jurassic Salt in the Gulf of Mexico can be divided into two main regions: the Northern Gulf of Mexico salt basin and the Campeche salt basin; interpreted to have formed simultaneously. Also referred to as the Louann and the Yucatan Salt basins.(Jurassic evolution of the Gulf of Mexico salt basin. Michael R. Hudec, Ian O. Norton, Martin P. A. Jackson, and Frank J. Peel; AAPG Bulletin, v. 97, no. 10 (October 2013), pp. 1683‚Äì1710) Salt deposition in the Gulf of Mexico is poorly dated; the Louann Salt has no index fossils and the age is based on the ages of formations below and above. Salt deposition began in the Jurassic after the first rotation of the Yucatan Block. The thick halite was later split into two main sections as the seafloor spread, with some continued salt deposition as the rifting continued. The age of the salts are supported by the stratigraphy in the northern Gulf of Mexico where the Eagle Mills red beds, as discussed above, contain dikes as young as 180 Ma, and the Smackover formation above the salts contain index ammonite fossils placing the salts at an age no younger than 156 Ma.The Gulf of Mexico Basin Salvador, Amos, J Geol. Soc. Am., Boulder, CO, United States( 1991) Deformation of this nearly 4-kilometer halite formation would eventually be caused by differential pressure due to uneven and heavy sediment loading on top, by siliciclastic, eolian, playa and other sediments characteristic of arid terrestrial environments closer to shore, implying that at certain times during deposition, sediments accumulated almost up to sea level. Simplified Stratigraphic Sequence of Northern Gulf of Mexico from the Late-Triassic through Early-Cretaceous The salt structures, which include anticlines, pillows, plugs and walls, in addition to extensive sheets, were created long after deposition by the rapid overlying sedimentation. Nearer the depocenter, which for the Gulf of Mexico basin was towards the spreading center, terrestrial sediments grade into marine shales and limestones. Post salt deposition, the strata recorded millions of years of marine flooding sediments, carbonates from coral reefs, thick sandstones, and eventual deltaic sediments, all of which helped shape the characteristic features within the Gulf. A large, marine shelf platform, the Florida Platform, and underwater marine canyons formed in the 150 million years after the opening of the gulf. Post-rift Post rift sediments are the results of a several million year story involving various carbonate reef formations, and heavy erosion events which flooded the gulf with terrestrial clastic sediments from inland North America, essentially recording the tectonic history of the North American continent since the Cretaceous. The first post-rift sediments deposited on the Florida Platform were also Mid-Jurassic evaporites, followed by deltaic and shallow-marine siliciclastics; eventually sediments grade into the Cretaceous carbonates, evaporites, and chalks. More recently, the Laramide Orogeny and consequential uplift of the Rocky Mountains, which led to increased sediments flooding the gulf, is responsible for the rapid loading and burial of the Wilcox Formation (pg 43), which is one of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico formations currently being exploited for hydrocarbons. This rapid loading is also responsible for the first salt flows from beneath the basin- margin region towards the continental slope.

The Adare Basin is a geologic structural basin located north-east of Cape Adare of Antarctica, for which its named, and north of the western Ross Sea. The Adare Basin is an extensional rift basin located along a seafloor spreading center that forms the failed arm of the Tertiary spreading ridge separating East and West Antarctica, known as the West Antarctic Rift System and similar in structure to the East Africa Rift System. Centrally located in the Adare Basin is the Adare Trough. The extension of this rift system is recorded in a series of magnetic anomalies which run along the seafloor at the extinct, north-south trending, Adare spreading axis. The Adare spreading system continues unbroken into the Northern Basin underlying the adjacent Ross Sea continental shelf. Antarctic extension The continent of Antarctica is divided into two continental blocks, separated by the Transantarctic Mountains of the West Antarctic Rift System. East Antarctica, also known as Greater Antarctica, composes two-thirds of the landmass of Antarctica and is considered the coldest and driest landmass on Earth. East Antarctica is a stable craton of Precambrian age. Meanwhile, West Antarctica is an orogenic belt composed of several smaller units, which converged 100 ma. These units are covered in a vast ice sheet, known as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Two major extensional events have affected the West Antarctic Rift System. This led to the formation of a series of continuous, north-south trending basins stretching from the Transantarctic mountains out into the Ross Sea embayment. The first is associated with the breakup of the supercontinent, Gondwana (Gondwanaland), during the Jurassic or Cretaceous. The second, is associated with the formation of the West Antarctic Rift System between East and West Antarctica, which began in the Eocene and lasted into the late Oligocene era. This extensional phase was responsible for the formations of the basins on the continental shelf, including the Adare Basin. There has been considerable debate over the kinematic history of the West Antarctic Rift System. =Adare extension= Since the Middle Cretaceous Era 100 million years ago, paleomagnetic measurements suggest that there have been between 500 and 1000 km transtentional motions between East and West Antarctica. Offset magnetic lineations can be used to establish spreading history of the Adare Basin specifically. These resolvable marine magnetic anomalies run along the spreading axis of the Adare basin and reveal a rate of extension between the plates. Extension took place for 17 million years during the middle Cenozoic Era, from between 43-26 million years ago. Seafloor spreading in the basin took place at a constant rate in opposite directions, the seafloor spread faster in an eastward direction at a rate of 7.5 mm/year, while it spread to the west at a rate of 5 mm/year. This spreading has accounted for about 170 km of plate separation. The formation of the Adare Trough, an uplift feature, formed as a result of fault reactivation within the first 5 million years after spreading stopped. No significant extension takes place in the Adare Basin after the Adare trough in the Neogene Era from 23-3 million years ago. The set of magnetic lineations defining the Adare Basin continue unbroken under the adjacent continental shelf of north western Ross Sea. These anomaly lineations coincide with the Northern Basin, implying that Northern Basin is floored by oceanic crust that was subsequently infilled by younger sediments to form the morphological continental shelf. In addition, rupture of the continental crust in this region must have occurred at the onset of Adare Basin formation Geologic map of the Adare Basin off coast of Antarctica. Adare Trough prominent in center of image. Geologic map of the Adare Basin with 250 meter contour lines highlighted. The Adare Trough The Adare Trough is a single, northwest-southeast trending, graben roughly 120 km long with high rifted flanks located centrally in the Adare Basin, 100 km northwest of Cape Adare. The flanks are roughly 40 km apart and are asymmetrical when compared to one another, with the East flank rising higher than the west by roughly 550 meters. The major uplift required to form the Adare trough marks the last major extensional phase of the Adare basin. Magnetic anomalies curve southwards from the Adare Trough towards the Ross Sea, indicating the Adare Trough is part of the extinct third arm of a West Antarctic Rift System ridge- ridge-ridge triple junction. Numerous volcanic cones are located on the eastern half of the Adare Trough, as well as in the eastern end of the basin. Furthermore, seismic reflections of the trough indicate a shallow basement. These observations indicate an upwelling of hot mantle material resulted in a shallow lithosphere basement, which is further supported by low seismic velocities underneath the trough. Topographic Profile of the ocean floor surface of the Adare Basin Tectonic evolution Seismic reflection and swath bathymetry data in the Adare Basin and the adjacent Ross Sea shelf reveal three major tectonic events in recent times. =Oligocene event= The first event is one of Brittle deformation of the basin, and is represented by the appearance of normal faulting which took place ‚àº24 Ma. The faults dip toward the spreading axis and may have reactivated preexisting tectonic structures in order to begin the formation of the Adare Trough. This faulting resulted in negligible extension of less than 2 km, and did not seem to extend outside the basin. This faulting played an important role in the modern day sediment supply to the basin. =Early Miocene event= The second is an early Miocene (roughly 17 million years ago) rifting event which produced half grabens composed of west tilted blocks and east dipping normal faults which extended the basin between 3‚Äì5 km. Faulting resulted in the uplift of the western flank and southeastern corner of the Adare Trough, and subsidence south and southwest of the trough. The tilted blocks align in a northeast-southwest direction that starts south of the Adare Trough and heads toward Cape Adare. Faulting reached the shelf edge, indicating that this event was probably linked with rifting activity outside the basin, most likely with the east dipping faulting in the Northern Basin, a neighboring sedimentary basin in the Ross Embayment. No motion is observed in the Victoria Land Basin during this interval, as expected given its proximity to the Eocene‚ÄêOligocene pole of rotation. The pole of rotation between East and West Antarctica remained in the same location until the end of the early Miocene. This event marks the last major extension activity in the Adare Basin. =Pliocene event= The final event during the Pliocene marks the youngest phase of tectonic activity in the Adare Basin. Igneous material penetrated the sedimentary stratigraphy to create volcanic cones which protrude from the sediment stratigraphy, as well as subhorizontal and saucer-shaped sills interrupting the stratigraphy. 257 different volcanic features have been mapped in the basin, partially covered by additional sediment. Geochemical analyses of the Pliocene basalts and the southwest-northeast trending spatial distribution of volcanic centers within and outside the Adare Basin indicate a relation to the Miocene volcanic activity found on land southwest of the basin. Steep normal faults produced prominent seafloor scarps but resulted in only a minor extensional component. At this stage, in terms of horizontal motion, the Adare Basin is nearly locked. Stratigraphy =Sedimentation= Most sedimentation in the Adare Basin took place after the second extensional event. Sedimentation offshore Antarctica is primarily driven by pelagic settling, down-slope gravity flows, and across-slope current flows driven by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The continental slope in the Adare Basin is very steep and sinuous, causing turbidite channels to be common. Several Antarctic deep water currents are also responsible for depositing large amounts of sediment into the basin. Early Miocene tectonic faulting caused stratigraphic unconformities within the Adare Basin. These unconformities separate the deposition pattern into three characteristically unique domains of stratigraphic units in the Adare Basin. These are the West, East, and Center units, with the Center unit being inside the Adare Trough and along the spreading axis. Seismic transects reveal faster seismic velocities, deeper in the Center the West units of the basin, while faster velocities are detected shallower to the northeast of the trough in the East unit. This indicates that the stacked layers of sediment are thicker above the spreading axis than above the flanks of the trough. =Stratigraphic units= Small sonar systems attached to floating buoys, called sonobuoys have been used by geologists to shoot seismic transects across the Adare Basin in order to establish 2D velocity models of the subsurface stratigraphy beneath the seafloor down to a depth of 5.5 km. The deeper deposited sediment has been compacted under heavier pressures for longer time periods, causing the sediment to become denser and the velocity of the seismic waves to increase with depth. Velocities from beneath the Adare Trough tend to be slightly higher than the average, indicating that the lithosphere is slightly thicker underneath the trough than the surrounding basin. Within the depth capable of measurement 6 distinct stratigraphic units have been established with characteristic velocities. The first unit begins at the seafloor with a velocity of 2000 m/s. The second unit lies 0.6 km beneath the seafloor and waves propagate with a velocity of 3000 m/s. The third layer begins at 1.8 km beneath the seafloor and has a velocity of 4200 m/s. The next layer begins at 2.3 km and has a velocity of 4900 m/s, followed by a layer at 3.1 km with 5700 m/s wave velocity. The final layer lies 3.3 km beneath the surface and displays velocities of 6000 m/s. =Lithosphere and basement character= Seismic transects, using sonobuoys, reveal additional crustal structures beneath layers of sediment, which the Moho is defined in the basin by a seismic velocity of 8000 m/s. The total lithospheric thickness of the basin is thicker along the central Trough and along the southwest end closest to the continental shelf. These reading measure to a basement depth of 5‚Äì6 km. Fast velocities detected in shallower depths are consistent with the presence of oceanic crust measurements, indicating the Adare basin extends past the continental shelf and onto the oceanic plate. This further confirms the presence of initiation of seafloor spreading along the spreading axis before the extinction of rifting in the Adare Basin.

The basin lies within a Northeast and Southwest trending strait that separates the peninsula from the nearby South Shetland Islands to the Northwest. The basin extends for more than from Smith Island (South Shetland Islands) to a portion of the Hero Fracture Zone. The basin can be subdivided into three basins: Western, Central, and Eastern. The Western basin is long by wide with a depth of , the Central basin is long by wide with a depth of , and the Eastern basin is long by wide with a depth of over . The three basins are separated by the Deception Island and Bridgeman Island. The moho depth in the region has been seismically interpreted to be roughly deep.  Tectonic development  Schematic cartoon of the Bransfield Basin tectonic setting. The Bransfield Basin is considered to be a back-arc basin that is located behind the South Shetland Islands. The Islands are believed to have formed from a period of subduction that occurred between the Phoenix Plate and the Antarctic plate starting roughly 200 million years ago during the Mesozoic. It is believed that the Phoenix plate stopped subducting under the Antarctic plate at least 4 million years ago during the Pliocene. Once the subduction ceased, it is believed that the extension that created the basin was initiated. Aeromagnetic surveys have provided evidence that the extension occurred 1.8 million years ago during the Pleistocene at a rate of per year. It is widely accepted that the Bransfield Basin formed from extension caused by slab rollback. New geophysical and structural data contradicts previously believed theories about slab rollback being the main mechanism for the opening of the basin. A newer theory for the opening of the basin is attributed to sinistral strike-slip motion between the Scotia plate and Antarctic plates. It is theorized that the trench between the Phoenix and Antarctic plates is locked in place and there is not any motion within the trench. The new data suggests trench retreat is not attributed as a mechanism for extension because there is a lack of seismic activity in the South Shetland Trench area, and that slab rollback is not a mechanism for extension either because if it were then Northwest-Southeast extension should be observed in the entire South Shetland region but instead compression can be observed. It is proposed that the motion between the Scotia plate and Antarctic plate are pushing the Phoenix plate to the Northwest creating compression. There are 10 identified volcanoes along the 300 km long ridge from Bridgeman Island to Deception Island. Deception (30 km diameter base), Penguin (8 km diameter base), and Bridgeman (25 km diameter base) islands are the tops of Pleistocene-Recent stratovolcanoes, while 7 additional submarine volcanoes exist as seamounts, with the Orca Seamount being the largest (20 km diameter base).  Geology  Cross section of the Bransfield Basin during alternating phases of glaciation The main factor that controls deposition inside the Bransfield Basin is glacial cyclicity. Additional contributing factors include physiography, tectonics, and oceanography. Three stratigraphic units have been identified on the margins. The oldest unit is an over- consolidated diamicton from subglacial processes. The middle unit is a pebbly-sandy stratified mud from the proximal-ice or sub-ice shelf. The youngest unit consists of diatmaceous mud originating from open marine conditions. Sedimentary systems occur on the margins that are related to glacial and glacialmarine, mass wasting, seabed fluid-escape, and countour current processes. = Glacial processes = Glacial processes have deposited a subglacial deformation till. The sediment that makes up this unit is derived from pressure melting of the glacier and from the substrate the glacier passed over. The subglacial deformation till unit is composed of a matrix-supported diamicton. = Glacial marine processes = Glacial marine processes have deposited two different units within the region. One of the units comprises proglacial debris flows have deposited a matrix-supported diamicton with interbeds of laminated mud on the lower portion of the continental slope. The other depositional process is a mixture of rain out from the ice from either melting or instantaneous dumping from the surface of an overturned portion of ice, and from marine rain out. The terrigenous and biogenic material compounds together to form sandy muds with sparse clasts. = Open marine processes = Open marine processes have deposited three units within the region. One of the units is a fining-upwards turbidity current deposit can be observed within the lower slope of the basin. Layers of volcanic ash around thick are within the deposit. Another unit is a contorted/disturbed mud that makes up a slide unit. This unit is distinct because its angular contacts and disturbed structures that form from sediment reworking and plastic deformation from sliding. The third unit is a stratified mud with clast layers at the lower slope's foot. This unit is deposited from contour currents, and differences in clast size is attributed to shifting current conditions.  Magmatism  The subduction event between the Phoenix plate and the Antarctic plate have built a volcanic arc consisting of low potassium to medium potassium content along the Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands. Volcanism occurred in multiple events during 130-110, 90-70, 60-40, and 30 -20 million years ago. The paucity can be interpreted as subducting younger crust or subsidence the post 20 million years arc after the basin formed. Volcanism is widespread within the Quaternary which created a series of submarine volcanoes. The submarine volcanoes produce glassy lavas ranging in compositions similar to what would be expected in arcs higher in large-ion lithophile elements to enriched mid-ocean ridge basalts. The Bransfield Basin is abnormal when it comes to the style of volcanism that can be observed within the basin. Undersea volcanoes experience what is called bimodal volcanism. Igneous rocks within the basin are Andesite and Basalt. The closer to the center of the undersea volcanoes the composition of the rocks shifts towards more felsic rock types such as Rhyolite, Rhyodacite, and Dacite. The source of this phenomenon is interpreted as a result from indicate formation from partial melting or fractional crystallization. This type of volcanism is commonly observed in Phanerozoic volcanic massive sulfide systems, and is not commonly observed in modern back-arc basins. Examples of where bimodal volcanism can be observed are the Okinawa Trough and the Sumizu Rift. The occurrence of incipient seafloor spreading in the basin is under controversy. Some researchers suggest that it does not occur within the basin because of the crustal thickness, magnetic anomaly patterns, and intracrustal diapirism. Other geoscientists suggest that it is occurring and is related to seamount volcanism and normal faulting within the basin.

Eastern edge of Lakshmi Planum seen in gray on the left. Tesserae are regions of heavily deformed terrain on Venus, characterized by two or more intersecting tectonic elements, high topography, and subsequent high radar backscatter. Tesserae often represent the oldest material at any given location and are among the most tectonically deformed terrains on Venus's surface. Diverse types of tessera terrain exist. It is not currently clear if this is due to a variety in the interactions of Venus's mantle with regional crustal or lithospheric stresses, or if these diverse terrains represent different locations in the timeline of crustal plateau formation and fall. Multiple models of tessera formation exist and further extensive studies of Venus's surface are necessary to fully understand this complex terrain. Exploration Pioneer Venus Orbiter detected regions of anomalous radar properties and high backscatter. Using SAR imaging, the Venera 15 and Venera 16 orbiters revealed these regions to be chaotically tiled terrain, which Soviet scientists named \\"–ø–∞—Ä–∫–µ—Ç\\" (parquet), later known as \\"Tesserae\\".Barsukov, V.L., et al, \\"The geology of Venus according to the results of an analysis of radar images obtained by Venera-15 and Venera-16 Preliminary data\\", Geokhimiya, Dec. 1984 The most recent data concerning tessera terrain comes from the Magellan Mission, in which the majority of Venus's surface was mapped in high resolution (~100 m/pixel). Future missions to Venus would allow for further understanding of tessera terrain. Locations Tesserae are recognized as covering 7.3% of Venus's surface, approximately 33.2√ó106 km, and occur mostly within a few extensive provinces. They are heavily concentrated between 0¬∞E and 150¬∞E. These longitudes represent a large area between a crustal extension center in the Aphrodite Terra and a crustal convergence center in Ishtar Terra. Tesserae are exposed almost entirely within Venus's crustal plateaus. Tessera inliers, regions of tessera not found within current crustal plateaus are thought to represent regions of collapsed crustal plateaus. Large regions of tessera terrain are labelled based on their latitude. Regions in the equatorial and southern latitudes are labelled as \\"Regio\\" while regions in the northern latitudes are labelled as \\"Tesserae\\" . A comprehensive list of Regiones and Tesserae can be found under List of geological features on Venus. Some well explored regions of tessera include: *Aphrodite Terra *Alpha Regio *Beta Regio *Fortuna Tessera *Ovda Regio Interpretive outline of tessera terrain (white outline) imposed on \\"GIS Map of Venus\\" (GIS Map of Venus source: USGS Astrogeology Science Center) Formation Model of crustal plateau and tessera terrain formation via mantle downwelling after Gilmore (1998). Tesserae represent an ancient time of globally thin lithosphere on Venus. Tessera Terrain does not participate in the global resurfacing events of Venus. It was thought by many researches that the Tesserae might form a global \\"onion skin\\" of sorts, and extended beneath Venus's regional plains. However, the currently accepted models support regional formation. Multiple models have been put forward to explain the formation of tessera terrain. Models of formation by mantle downwelling and pulsating continents are the most currently accepted models. A model of formation due to a lava pond via bolide impact was put forth, although it has not currently gained much traction in the scientific community due to skepticism of the ability of a bolide impact to generate sufficient melt. A model of formation due to mantle plumes (upwelling) was persistent for many years, however, it has since been abandoned due to its contradictory prediction of sequences of extension versus the observed cross cutting relationships. =Downwelling= Model of crustal plateau and tessera terrain formation after Hansen (2006). In the downwelling model, mantle downwelling, possibly due to mantle convection, causes compression and thickening of the crust, creating the compressional elements of tessera terrain. Isostatic rebound occurs due to the crustal thickening. After downwelling ends, a delamination event within the mantle produces extensional elements of tessera. This model does not currently explain tessera's location within crustal plateaus, and instead predicts a domical shape. =Lava pond via giant impact= In the lava pond via giant impact model, melt due to a bolide impact on a thin lithosphere rises to the surface to form a lava pond. Convection throughout the lava pond resulted in surface deformation that created tessera terrain. Isostatic rebound of the solidified pond creates a crustal plateau structure. This model does not currently explain how convection could transmit enough force to deform several kilometers of brittle material. =Pulsating continents= Pulsating continents model In the pulsating continents model, differentiated, low density crust survives early global subduction events forming continental regions. These regions undergo compression due to heating from the surrounding mantle, forming the compressional features of tessera, such as fold and thrust belts, and basin dome terrain. After sufficient crustal thickening has occurred, new lithosphere is generated causing gravitational collapse, producing the extensional features of tessera, such as extensive grabens. During this collapse, decompression causes partial melting, producing the intratessera volcanism seen within the larger regions of tessera terrain. This model requires that the material comprising tessera terrain is continental in nature. Future missions to venus to sample surface compositions are necessary to support this model. This model does not currently explain how a global subduction event could cause the delamination of the entire mantle lithosphere, leaving only low density crust behind. Variety of tessera terrain Individual patterns of Tessera Terrain record the variations in interactions of the mantle with local regional stresses. This variation manifests itself in a wide array of diverse terrain types. Multiple types of sampled Tessera Terrain are below, however, they are not meant as a classification scheme, and instead emphasize the variety of terrain types. Fold Terrain is easily recognizable by its well defined linear fabrics. This type of terrain is composed of long ridges and valleys, greater than 100 km long, that are cross cut by minor extensional fractures that run perpendicular to the fold axes of the ridges. This likely formed due to unidirectional contraction. Lava Flow Terrain is named such due to its resemblance to Pahoehoe flows found on Earth, with long curving ridges. It is thought that this terrain may be formed due to displacement and deformation due to movement of the material beneath these crustal pieces. Ribbon Terrain is characterized by ribbons and folds that are typically orthogonal to one another. Ribbons are long and narrow extensional troughs that are separated by narrow ridges. Ribbon terrain can be found both in large crustal plateaus and within tessera inliers. S-C Terrain is named such due to its geometric similarity to S-C tectonic fabrics on Earth. It consists of two main structures: synchronous folds and small, 5 to 20 km long graben that cross cut the folds perpendicularly. Unlike many other types of tessera terrain, S-C terrain indicates a simple, rather than complex deformation history in which deformation due to widespread motion on Venus is widely distributed. This type of terrain also indicates that strike-slip movement on Venus's surface is possible. Basin and Dome Terrain, also known as honeycomb terrain, consists of curved ridges and troughs that form a pattern analogous to an egg carton. These structures represent multiple phases of deformation, and are considered the most complex appearing style of tessera. Basin and dome terrain is typically found within the center of crustal plateaus. Star Terrain is composed of multiple graben and fractures that trend in many directions, but radiate in a star-like pattern. This pattern is thought to be due to doming underneath previously deformed and fractured areas, in which the local uplift causes the radiating pattern.

It inhabited what is now modern-day western Europe. The Don wolf (C. l. brevis) from eastern Europe is regarded as a taxonomic synonym, which indicates that one subspecies once lived across Europe. Taxonomy The cave wolf was first described by Georg August Goldfuss in 1823 based on a wolf pup skull found in the Zoolithen Cave located at Gailenreuth, Bavaria, Germany. In the early to middle Late Pleistocene, these large wolves existed all over Europe. They have not been studied in any degree of depth, and their relationship to modern wolves has not been clarified using DNA. All of the top predators in Europe commenced going extinct with the loss of the pleistocene megafauna when conditions became colder during the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum around 23,000 years ago. The last cave wolves used the side branches of the main caves to protect their pups from the cold climate. During this time the cave wolf was replaced by a smaller wolf-type, which then disappeared along with the reindeer, to finally be replaced by the Holocene warm-period European wolf Canis lupus lupus. In 2009, a study of the fossil remains of Paleolithic dogs and Pleistocene wolves found that five wolf specimens from Trou Baileux, Belgium, Trou des Nutons, Belgium, Mezine, Ukraine, and Yakutia, Siberia had a greater snout width than recent wolves. A similar trend was discovered in the North American fossil East Beringian wolf. In Hungary in 1969, a tooth (the premolar of the Maxilla) was found which dated to the Middle Pleistocene, and was assessed as being midway between that of Canis mosbachensis and Canis lupus spelaeus, but leaning towards C.l. spelaeus. Description Diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled Cave wolf populations are known from three caves separated by a few kilometers from each other that are located on the Franconia Karst along the Wiesent and Ahorn River vallies in the Upper Franconia region of the state of Bavaria, Germany. Sophie's Cave sits on the northwest slope of the Ailsbach Valley near Rabenstein Castle in the Ahorntal municipality. Gro√üe Teufels Cave (Big Devil's Cave) and the Zoolithen Cave are located nearby. They are also known from Hermann's Cave in the village of R√ºbeland near the town of Wernigerode, in the district of Harz, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Its bone proportions are close to those of the Canadian Arctic-boreal mountain-adapted timber wolf and a little larger than those of the modern European wolf. Some postcranial bones have similarly large proportions to those from the Sophie's and Gro√üe Teufels Caves, where the bone sizes are closer to those of Scandinavian Arctic and Canadian Columbian wolf subspecies than to those of the smaller European wolves. Bone sizes are one-eighth larger than European wolves, and this wolf was a specialized Late Pleistocene wolf ecomorph. Adaptation Cave wolf illustration Their dens have been identified, with the Zoolithen Cave supporting a large population and has yielded more than 380 bones as well as several skulls (including a holotype). Sophie's Cave has demonstrated the first \\"Early Late Pleistocene wolf den\\", with intensive faecal places and the first European record of half-digested cave bear bones found within the faecal areas in the cave. It demonstrates that wolves seem not to have used this cave as a cub-raising den, but that they were cave dwellers that fed on cave bear carcasses, similar to but less so than cave hyenas, but more so than cave lions. The abundant faeces seem to play a role in the \\"orientation\\" for trail tracking, similar to modern wolves, and less as den marking. The high abundance in a limited area of the Bear's Passage of the cave might be the result of periodical short-term den use of smaller cave areas. Wolves were scavenging on the bears that hibernated and died there, and therefore a simultaneous use as both a wolf and a cave bear den cannot be expected. Remains of a skeleton of at least one high adult wolf also might have been the result of a battle within the cave with the bears, the same as in the lion taphonomic record. The ecology of the early to middle Late Pleistocene wolves on the mammoth steppe and the boreal forests is not known, nor is whether they used caves as dens. Don wolf The Don wolf (Canis lupus brevis) is the name designated to the fossil remains of wolves that were found at the Kostenki I Late Pleistocene site by the Don River at Kostyonki, Voronezh Oblast, Russia and reported in 1994. Based on the size of its dental rows, the Don wolf was bigger than modern wolves from the tundra or the Middle Russian taiga. The length of its P4 was longer than the row of its molars M1-M2, which is different to the Late Pleistocene wolves from the Caucasus or the Ural Mountains. Its main characteristic was its shorter legs, due to shorter humerus, radius, metacarpals, tibia, and metatarsals. In 2009, a study compared the skull of one of these wolves to those found in Western Europe, and proposed that C. l. brevis of eastern Europe and C. l. spelaeus of western Europe are synonyms for the same subspecies. These were both comparable to the remains of a 16,000 YBP wolf skull found on the Taimyr peninsula in far northern Siberia. Relationship with the dog Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) passes along the maternal line and can date back thousands of years. Therefore, phylogenetic analysis of mDNA sequences within a species provides a history of maternal lineages that can be represented as a phylogenetic tree. In 2013, a study analysed the complete and partial mitochondrial genome sequences of 18 fossil canids dated from 1,000 to 36,000 YBP from the Old and New Worlds, and compared these with the complete mitochondrial genome sequences from modern wolves and dogs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that modern dog mDNA haplotypes resolve into four monophyletic clades with strong statistical support, and these have been designated by researchers as clades A-D. Based on the specimens used in this study, clade A included 64% of the dogs sampled and these were sister to a 14,500 YBP wolf sequence from the Kessleroch cave near Thayngen in the canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland, with a most recent common ancestor estimated to 32,100 YBP. This group of dogs matched three fossil pre-Columbian New World dogs dated between 1,000 and 8,500 YBP, which supported the hypothesis that pre-Columbian dogs in the New World share ancestry with modern dogs and that they likely arrived with the first humans to the New World. Clade B included 22% of the dog sequences and was related to modern wolves from Sweden and the Ukraine, with a common recent ancestor estimated to 9,200 YBP. However, this relationship might represent mitochondrial genome introgression from wolves because dogs were domesticated by this time. Clade C included 12% of the dogs sampled and these were sister to two ancient dogs from the Bonn-Oberkassel cave (14,700 YBP) and the Kartstein cave (12,500 YBP) near Mechernich in Germany, with a common recent ancestor estimated to 16,000‚Äì24,000 YBP. Clade D contained sequences from 2 Scandinavian breeds (Jamthund, Norwegian Elkhound) and were sister to another 14,500 YBP wolf sequence also from the Kesserloch cave, with a common recent ancestor estimated to 18,300 YBP. Its branch is phylogenetically rooted in the same sequence as the \\"Altai dog\\" (not a direct ancestor). The data from this study indicated a European origin for dogs that was estimated at 18,800‚Äì32,100 years ago based on the genetic relationship of 78% of the sampled dogs with ancient canid specimens found in Europe. The data supports the hypothesis that dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture and was initiated close to the Last Glacial Maximum when hunter- gatherers preyed on megafauna. The study found that three ancient Belgium canids (the 36,000 YBP \\"Goyet dog\\" cataloged as Canis species, along with Belgium 30,000 YBP and 26,000 years YBP cataloged as Canis lupus) formed an ancient clade that was the most divergent group. The study found that the skulls of the \\"Goyet dog\\" and the \\"Altai dog\\" had some dog-like characteristics and proposed that the may have represented an aborted domestication episode. If so, there may have been originally more than one ancient domestication event for dogs as there was for domestic pigs. One theory is that domestication occurred during one of the five cold Heinrich events that occurred after the arrival of humans in West Europe 37 000, 29 000, 23 000, 16 500 and 12 000 YBP. The theory is that the extreme cold during one of these events caused humans to either shift their location, adapt through a breakdown in their culture and change of their beliefs, or adopt innovative approaches. The adoption of the large wolf/dog was an adaptation to this hostile environment.

Interior of the chapel The chapel stands freely and has a rectangular plan which measures about eleven by fourteen metres. Having said that, it was originally built in the shape of a cross. In 1512, the rear end of the chapel was demolished and the stones were used in the construction of the present church. It also had six doors though only two remain. The church served as parish church until 1676 when the present church was built. A belfry was added in the 16th century.Grech, Alex. \\"A medieval gem: Bir Miftuh Chapel\\", Malta inside out, Malta.

The film stars Jack Holt, Sylvia Breamer, Clarence Burton, Anne Schaefer, Jean De Briac, and Edwin Stevens. The film was released on July 2, 1922, by Paramount Pictures. Plot Silent Era describes the film as a South Seas drama. From a newspaper story of the era: \\"The police force of the island in question is limited to three men of assorted uniforms and arms, who would rather do anything than face danger. Many parts of the world are no better policed and the comparative freedom from fear of punishment makes these gentry bold and aggressive. Jack Holt, in the role of Robert Kendall, shows how a man who believes that the same conditions of comparative honesty and freedom from danger obtain on the island as elsewhere, and finds himself mistaken, runs into a situation where he has to take the law into his own hands. When out in one of his boats, he provides himself with a machine gun and in one encounter with pearl pirates, sinks their schooner when they try to drive him away from his own pearl concession.\\"  Cast  *Jack Holt as Robert Kendall *Sylvia Breamer as Rita Durand *Clarence Burton as Nilsson *Anne Schaefer as Duenna *Jean De Briac as Perrier *Edwin Stevens as Michaels *Willard Louis as Governor of Papeete Filming troubles From a period newspaper: \\"Famous Plea Fruitless. \\"Don't give up the ship.\\" This time this was not the appeal of the famous Perry, but Clarence Burton's instructions, and he found them difficult to carry out, especially when the ship gave him up-by sinking. Burton, together with a gang of men who took the parts of pearl divers, was in command of a pearling tug in the new Paramount picture, \\"The Man Unconquerable.\\" As usual, Burton was the villain. Jack Holt, the star of the picture, in an armed launch gave him battle. Presently the tug commenced to sink, faster than they had intended. \\"Stick to it!\\" yelled Joseph Henabery, the director, hurrying to get the close-ups. But before he could arrive on the scene the tug had gone under. The only close-ups he secured were of Burton and his pearl divers splashing about on the surface trying to remove their clothes so that they could remain afloat. One of the deck hands on the photographer's boat stood by with a boat hook to pull them out when they showed signs of going down for the third time. In order to get a good \\"shot\\" of the sinking boat it was necessary to drag it by chains to shallow water at high tide and repair it at low tide. For four days a crew of laborers worked at the job; then they sat disgustedly on the beach while they watched the tug towed out to sea again and resunk -this time, properly and with due regard to the fans.\\" Filming locations Beach scenes were shot along Balboa Beach in California.

Based at Stord Airport, S√∏rstokken, it operated a fleet of Beechcraft Super King Air and later Dornier Do 328 aircraft. The airline was established as Nye Partnair A/S in January 1990, with largely the same owners and assets from the newly bankrupt Partnair. It was initially based at Haugesund Airport, Karm√∏y, but moved to Stord the following year following the purchase by Jon Furdal. The airline initially flew from Stord to Oslo. Flights started out of Skien Airport, Geiteryggen in 1993 and from Farsund Airport, Lista in 1996. The airline went through several owners, with Leif Georg Amundsen buying it in 1995. It struggled financially and filed for bankruptcy on 19 February 1999. History Air Stord Beechcraft Super King Air at Aberdeen Airport in September 1991 Air Stord had its origin in the aftermath of the bankruptcy of Partnair in October 1989. Its owners, the Thorsen brothers, established Nye Partnair (\\"New Partnair\\") along with Jostein Nerhus and Eirik M. Eide. The latter two were the owners of Fonnafly, which Partnair had bought half of in mid 1989. Nye Partnair was incorporated in January 1990 and bought large portions of the estate in bankruptcy. This gave it an initial fleet of four Beechcraft Super King Air and one Beechcraft King Air.Resser: 45 The King Air was sold in 1991.Hagby: 273 Nye Partnair was based at Haugesund Airport, Karm√∏y. It applied for an received concessions to operate a route from Karm√∏y to Stavanger Airport, Sola and Bergen Airport, Flesland. However, neither of these routes were ever started. At Haugesund Airport the airline took over Norving's former hangar and office facility and used it as a base.Reitan: 94 However, it instead chose to commence a service from Stord Airport, S√∏rstokken and Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The Thorsen brothers sold 52 percent of the airline to Jon Furdal in May 1991. The Kvinnherad-based aircraft broker stated that he saw a potential for growth on the Oslo to Stord route. He also saw the need for a new name and to relocate maintenance from Haugesund to Stord Airport.Resser: 47 Stord Municipality gave the company 25,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) to relocate,Resser: 49 which took place on 27 July. By then the fleet was reduced to three aircraft and the airline changed its name to Air Stord.Resser: 48 Stord Airport, S√∏rstokken The airline increased from two to four daily round trips Monday through Friday from August, and introduced a fifth daily service on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Friday from October. The following spring the airline established its second route, from Stord to Stavanger Airport, Sola. The same year it bid for offering air ambulance services for the National Air Ambulance Service using Super King Airs, but the bid was unsuccessful.Resser: 51 By 1992, Jon Furdal had bought all the shares in the airline. However, he chose to sell ninety percent of the company to Gregor Nys√¶ter at the end of the year.Resser: 54 Both Air Stord and Coast Air were in April and May 1993 granted concessions on the route from Skien Airport, Geiteryggen to Bergen Airport, Flesland. The domestic aviation market was deregulated from 1 April 1994 and Teddy Air stated competing with Air Stord on the Bergen route. Air Stord flew 31 flights per week, compared to the 16 offered by Teddy Air. Beechcraft Super King Air at Farsund Airport, Lista Teddy Air and Air Stord later commenced a cooperation on the route. Air Express considered opening a route from Oslo to Stord and proposed a cooperation with Air Stord.Resser: 58 This led to a restructuring of the airline in 1994, with Nys√¶ter selling the company. The airline was split into A and B shares. Aker Stord and Aker Elektro each bought 17.5 percent of the airline, Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap bought 10 percent and Inter Nor Stord Hotell and √Ösmund Myhre each bought 5 percent.Resser: 60 Later the group bought newly issued shares worth NOK 650,000.Resser: 61 The airline continued to lose money in 1994 and 1995. At the time S√∏rstokken had an insufficient runway to handle such aircraft.Resser: 62 Leif Georg Amundsen from B√∏mlo, through Amundsen Holding, bought all the shares in Air Stord on 31 December 1995. He announced that with the forthcoming expansion of the runway and terminal that the airline would start using the 33-seat Dornier Do 328 on the Stord to Oslo route.Resser: 63 With the take-over the company issued a capital increase of NOK 6.1 million, all bought by Amundsen Holding. With the work on the runway completed, Air Stord's first Do 328 could land at S√∏rstokken on 15 May 1996.Resser: 65 Christening of the airline's new Dornier Do 328 at Farsund Airport, Lista in 1996 Air Stord commenced scheduled services twice a day from Farsund Airport, Lista to Oslo and Stavanger from 24 June. Initially they used a Super King Air, later increasing to a nineteen- passenger Beechcraft 19. This was secured through two local shipping companies and the municipalities buying a significant portion of the airline. The Stavanger route was later terminated. Air Stord retired its King Airs between 1995 and 1997.Hagby: 106, 272 The airline continued to have ambitions of growth and in 1996 it announced that it would issue a capital increase of NOK 30 million. This was to secure finance of international routes, but neither these nor the capital increase were carried out, save for an eleven-million issue by Amundsen Holding. The airline went with a deficit in 1996 and in March 1997 it started bankruptcy negotiations.Resser: 67 This led to a restructuring of the airline, which at the time consisted of two Do 328s and 54 employees. The ground crew were offered to establish their own ground handling company and a number of other employees were laid off.Resser: 70 This led to all routes except Stord‚ÄìOslo and Farsund‚ÄìOslo to be terminated. Air Stord was one of several airlines in 1998 to announce that they could operate out of a possible civilian airport situated at Rygge Air Station. The Oslo flights moved to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen on 8 October 1998. By then the airline was operating three Do 328s. The airline was under sustained financial distress and was not making a profit on its routes. Air Stord filed for bankruptcy on 19 February 1999 and the following day all services were terminated.

It was used by various government and academic agencies until at least the late 1960s. The rocket carried what was essentially a radiosonde payload and was capable of reaching over 3000 feet (914 meters), where it then ejected a parachute and sent telemetry about temperature, humidity and barometric pressure during descent. A ground station with a manually tracked antenna received the signal where the data was processed and recorded.  Vehicle overview  The Cricketsonde rocket, made primarily of aluminum, was approximately 2.5 feet in length and 3 inches in diameter, and consisted of a propellant section, a recovery section, and a payload section. With the standard payload (telemetry package, battery and parachute), it weighed 5.5 lbs fully fueled. Depending on payload weight, the cricketsonde could achieve altitudes of over 3700 feet (1127 meters). = Propulsion section = A combination of acetone and liquid CO2 was used as the propellant. This mixture was used to control the thrust and thrust duration and was pumped into the rocket just before flight. The amount of fuel usually equated to about 2 seconds of thrust. = Telemetry and instrumentation section = Cricketsonde Telemetry Package 01 Nose section of the Cricketsonde rocket with nose cover removed. Telemetry and sensor electronics shown. The telemetry package included a transmitter (operating on 403 MHz), blocking oscillator, pressure switch and battery. A multivibrator switched the temperature and humidity sensors into the circuit, while a baroswitch over-rode the multivibrator to transmit pressure readings. The instrumentation consisted of a temperature, humidity and pressure sensors. The temperature sensor was a (at the time) standard ML-419 element, while the humidity sensor was a standard ML-476 carbon element. An aneroid-type baroswitch served as the pressure sensor. The temperature and humidity sensors were mounted in a vented housing attached to the parachute, which was exposed to the atmosphere when the parachute was ejected after apogee. Data sampling of temperature and humidity occurred approximately every 30 feet during decent, while pressure readings were taken about every 500 feet (152 meters). Power was supplied by a water-activated battery (Ray-O-Vac BSC5), which was inserted just prior to flight. A removable cover on the nose cone provided access. = Recovery section = Nose section of the Cricketsonde rocket with nose and payload covers removed. Telemetry and sensor electronics along with recovery parachute shown. The rocket was able to be recovered as the recovery section contained a 5-foot parachute, to which the entire rocket was attached. After launch, a preset timer controlled deployment of the parachute.  Ground equipment  The ground receiving station consisted of a manually tracked antenna, receiver, recorder and a power generator. More specifically, the receiver setup was composed of a microwave receiver (Polard Model R), frequency meter and discriminator (General Radio Corp Type 1142-A), a loudspeaker, and a multivibrator-pulse shaper.  Operation  Cricketsonde Launcher 01 In preparing the rocket for launch, the propellant chamber was first partially filled with acetone, then liquid CO2 was pumped in to a pressure of 400psi, being dissolved by the acetone in the process. After propellant charging was completed, the rocket was loaded tail-first into the launch breech, and a valved plug inserted into the nozzle. The launch chamber below the breech was charged with gaseous CO2 under pressure, and a launch tube added to the breech. At launch, a valve released the gaseous CO2 to expel the rocket. As the rocket left the launch tube, the plug in the rocket nozzle dropped off, allowing the rocket's fins to be deployed and the propellent charge to be released through the nozzle. The propellent discharge lasted about two seconds, giving the rocket a velocity of about 550fps (167 meters per second) and about 75g's acceleration for a .75 lb payload. After the propellant was exhausted, the rocket coasted to apogee, obtained approx 13‚Äì14 seconds after launch (with a .75 lb payload). A timer device then opened the parachute compartment, deploying the 5-foot parachute, and the rocket descended at about 10 fps (3 meters per second).  Development and operational use history  October - December 1963: Cricketsonde flights were conducted at the Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts, to determine the operational feasibility of the system. The results indicated \\"that the Cricketsonde had a good potential as an operational system.\\" 1964 or 1965 - At the request of a Texaco representative, the Cricketsonde was given operational tests with inconclusive results by WO Gary Meyers, USMC and members of the Marine Corps aerological staff at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina. Later, the Cricketsonde was tested on a field exercise at Page Field, Parris Island, South Carolina. Recollections of LtCol Gary Meyers, USMC Ret. August 1966, August 1968: The Cricketsonde system was used in conjunction with lidar to make vertical temperature and humidity structure observations. These observations were used to examine any relationship between vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols and the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity, the purpose being to explore the utility of optical radar to detect and measure meteorological features of the lower atmosphere, such as temperature inversions, haze and smog layers, and humidity variations.

Hosted by Terry Crews, the funny videos show was inspired by YouTube channel FailArmy. A panel of comedians views and analyzes the videos, which are divided into categories. In the first season each panel member selected a favorite in each category. Crews chooses a video in each category and decides on the \\"Fail of the Week\\" at the end. The panel member who picked the \\"Fail of the Week\\" receives the trophy. The show states in a disclaimer that viewer submissions are not accepted; unlike America's Funniest Home Videos, this show makes no claim as to whether people in the videos were hurt by their reckless behavior. The show was picked up for a second season to begin in the fall of 2015, but they were expected to be 8 or 9 unaired episodes ordered in February. The second season began airing November 6, 2015. The name was shortened, Crews said, because not everything funny is necessarily a fail. Also, the panel of judges no longer nominated favorite videos. Although not officially cancelled, Fox has not ordered a third season of the series. The show has no direct connection to another past Fox show of the near-same title, The World's Funniest!, which aired on the network from 1998 until 2000 and was produced by Brad Lachman Productions.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built in 1886. It is also known as Sabbath School Hall. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  St Paul's Presbyterian Church (left) and Hall (right), circa 1912 The Sabbath School Hall, designed by colonial architect Francis Drummond Greville Stanley, was the first building to be erected on the Creek Street Presbyterian Church's newly acquired property in Leichhardt Street (now St Pauls Terrace), Spring Hill, in 1886. It was built on the site of Brisbane's first children's hospital, a wooden building which was demolished to make room for the hall. In form and fabric, the hall was designed well beyond immediate requirements, in anticipation of the Creek Street congregation playing a more prominent role in the development of Queensland Presbyterianism. From May 1886 to May 1889 the Sabbath School Hall functioned as a temporary church while the permanent St Paul's Church was under construction, establishing a precinct which later included church, hall and manse. The manse was demolished in the 1980s. Over the subsequent century the hall became the focus for the church's social activities, and was home to an active Sunday School in the period prior to the First World War. An extensive library was established in the hall in connection with the Sunday School. The building served more than the immediate congregation, and in the late 1920s was the venue for local gymnastic competitions. Falling attendances at evening church services during the 1930s depression resulted in their being conducted in the hall, often in a less formal manner than the regular service. In February 1942 during World War II the Australian defence authorities requisitioned the hall for possible use as an emergency centre during air raids, and from these premises the Hon. Robert Menzies conducted his final campaign meeting for the 1949 Australian federal election at which he became Prime Minister of Australia. In 1982 sections of the exterior brickwork were renovated, and early in 1984 a new floor was laid, wiring and power points were renewed, plumbing was repaired and the interior was painted.  Description  St Paul's Presbyterian Church Hall, designed in the gothic style with classical nuances, is a low, wide brick building with buttresses and stone facings, built to a T-shape plan with the leg abutting the street. It is capped with a gabled roof clad in broad profile galvanised iron, above which square brick and stone pinnacles rise from the buttresses at the ends of each of the four gables. The front facade, which has a northwest aspect, features a central, pointed-arch window with drip moulding, three green glass lights, tracery, and mullions; and gothic arched doorways with stone pediments above, on either side of the window. Above this is a broad pediment decorated with abbreviated blind panel tracery. The interior, with its rendered walls, timber dado panelling and raised dais at the eastern end, is lit by rectangular multi-paned windows located in the bays along the sides. The hall remains largely intact in form, fabric and function.  Heritage listing  St Paul's Presbyterian Church Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Paul's Presbyterian Church Hall, constructed in 1886, is significant historically as evidence of the Creek Street congregation's anticipation of playing a prominent role in Queensland Presbyterianism, and as an integral part of a cohesive ecclesiastical precinct formed with the adjoining St Paul's Presbyterian Church and boundary fence. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is a rare 1880s gothic-styled brick hall in Brisbane, and is an example of the ecclesiastical work of former colonial architect FDG Stanley. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

It is known by a variety of titles, including \\"I Wouldn't Mind Dying (If Dying Was All)\\" and \\"A Mother's Last Word to Her Daughter\\". It was recorded seven times before 1930, using the preceding titles. It has been most often recorded in gospel or gospel blues style, but also in other styles such as country.  Description  The song consists of several four-line verses (quatrains) and a repeated refrain. The words both of verses and of refrain often differ from one artist to another. A standard feature is that the refrain consists of four lines, the first three of which are identical. Common variants of those three lines include \\"Bye and bye we're (or, I'm) going to see the King\\" and \\"Holy, holy, holy is His name\\". The fourth line almost always begins \\"(I) wouldn't (or, don't) mind dying\\". It concludes in various ways in different versions, for example \\"If dying was all\\", or \\"But I gotta go by myself\\", or \\"Because I'm a child of God\\". \\"The King\\" is a title of the Christian God. Many versions include a verse which refers to the vision of the chariot in the Book of Ezekiel, Chapter 1. A line found in many versions, \\"He said he saw him coming with his dyed garments on\\", alludes to the Book of Isaiah at 63:1: Titles like \\"Bye and Bye We're Going to See the King\\" and \\"I Wouldn't Mind Dying (If Dying Was All)\\" are taken from the refrain. The title of the 1929 version by Washington Phillips, \\"A Mother's Last Word to Her Daughter\\", whose verses differ markedly from other versions, was presumably chosen to indicate that he intended it as a companion song to his \\"Mother's Last Word to Her Son\\" of 1927.

It is their eleventh single overall, and the band's final single as a seven-piece. 80's Romance was overall the band's least successful single to chart, peaking at #71. Background 80's Romance is a Torch song that conveys the singer and the lover not seeing each other like lovers should. The singer claims her \\"heart is cold\\". This possibly means that the singer thinks her love has been denied by her lover, even though some other lyrics in the song conflict with that message. Music video The music video for the song shows the band setting their stage up for the music video and then shows them in their dressing room. Jennie Matthias spins around, showing off her outfit, while Miranda Joyce is shown wearing a wig of Sarah-Jane Owen's hairstyle. Towards the end of the video, the band is shown attempting to run through a glass wall. Sarah-Jane Owen is the first person to break through the wall, which is revealed to actually be Miranda Joyce still wearing the wig from before. She is then applauded. The rest of the music video shows the band doing their dance routine for the chorus that is played throughout earlier in the video. The band then experiments with cameras etc. and the video exits by reversing the single cover where the band's animated faces are replaced with their real faces which was also something shown at the beginning of the video.

Early Chinese texts also referred to this legendary food with the names Sh√¨r√≤u (Ë¶ñËÇâ, \\"look like meat\\"), R√≤uzhƒ´ (ËÇâËäù, \\"meat excrescence\\"), and T√†isu√¨ (Â§™Ê≠≤, \\"great year; Jupiter\\"). R√≤ul√≠ngzhƒ´ (ËÇâÈùàËäù, \\"meat Lingzhi mushroom\\") is a modern name popularized by Chinese news media reporting on purported discoveries of Feng throughout China, including a widely publicized Xi'an television reporter who misidentified a sex toy as a roulingzhi monster. Names Fƒìng (Â∞Å, lit. \\"hump\\") meant \\"mound, tumulus, raise a mound; altar; earth up (a plant); wall, bank of field; boundary embankment, fief\\" in Old Chinese (Schuessler 2007: 237); and means \\"to seal; bank (a fire); confer (title/territory/etc.) upon, feudal; envelope\\" in Modern Standard Chinese (DeFrancis 2003: 259). Feng occurs in other Chinese mythological names. Fengzhbu (Â∞ÅË±¨, with \\"pig; swine\\") or Bifeng (‰ºØÂ∞Å, with \\"elder brother; uncle\\"), the son of Kui and Xuanqi (ÁéÑÂ¶ª, \\"Dark Consort\\"), was named owing to his \\"swinish\\" wickedness. Wolfram Eberhard (1968: 59) says, Fengzhu translates \\"pig with a hump\\" because feng means \\"hump\\", although commentaries often interpret the word as \\"big\\". Sh√¨r√≤u (Ë¶ñËÇâ, lit. \\"look like meat\\") compounds shi (Ë¶ñ \\"regard; look at/upon; inspect; watch; sight; vision\\") with rou (ËÇâ \\"meat; flesh; pulp; 'flesh' of melons/etc.\\"). The Kangxi Zidian dictionary entry for shi (Ë¶ñ) quotes Guo Pu's Shanhaijing commentary to use the otherwise unattested variant j√πr√≤u (ËÅöËÇâ, with ËÅö \\"gather; assemble; get together\\"). T«îr√≤u (ÂúüËÇâ, \\"soil flesh\\") compounds tu (Âúü \\"soil; earth; clay; land; crude\\") with rou. Compare turougui (ÂúüËÇâÊ°Ç, with Ê°Ç \\"cinnamon; cassia-bark tree\\"), which is the Chinese name for \\"Cinnamomum osmophloeum\\". R√≤uzhƒ´ (ËÇâËäù, \\"meat excrescence\\") uses rou with the complex word zhi (Ëäù, \\"supernatural mushrooms; excrescences\\"). Fabrizio Pregadio (2008: 1271) explains, The term zhi, \\"which has no equivalent in Western languages, refers to a variety of supermundane substances often described as plants, fungi, or 'excrescences'.\\" L√≠ngzhƒ´ (ÈùàËäù, \\"spiritual excrescence\\") ‚Äì known in English as the Lingzhi mushroom and identified with Ganoderma genus ‚Äì is seen in the modern Feng name R√≤ul√≠ngzhƒ´ (ËÇâÈùàËäù \\"meat Lingzhi mushroom\\"). T√†isu√¨ (Â§™Ê≠≤, \\"great year; Jupiter)\\", combining tai (Â§™, \\"great; very; too\\") and sui (Ê≠≤, \\"year (of age)\\") in reference to Jupiter's orbit of 11.86 years (12 years in Chinese tradition), is an old name for the planet Jupiter. Jupiter is the God of the Year in the Chinese zodiac and Fengshui, and worshiped in religious Daoism. Feng is considered to be the earthly manifestation of Jupiter's shen (Á•û, \\"spirit; god; deity\\"). Classical usages Beginning in the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), the Chinese classics have recorded Feng and its synonyms. The Shanhaijing has 14 usages of Sh√¨r√≤u (Ë¶ñËÇâ, lit. \\"look like meat/flesh\\"), in locations north, south, east, and west of \\"The Classic of Regions Beyond the Seas\\" and \\"The Classic of the Great Wilderness\\". Scholars generally date these textual sections from around the 1st century BCE to 1st century CE, making shirou the earliest recorded name for feng. For instance, > Mount Menial [ÁãÑÂ±±]- the great god Lofty lies buried on its south face; the > great god Tellswift lies buried on its north face. Here there are black > bears and brown bears, striped tigers, long-tailed apes, leopards, and also > the leave-scarlet bird, the look-flesh creature, and the sob-sigh creature. > (6, tr. Birrell 2000: 110) \\"Lofty\\" and \\"Tellswift\\" translate Emperor Yao and Emperor Ku. Birrell notes that the shirou is, > A fabled creature, the recurring animalian motif of numerous utopian > passages in the text, usually associated with the burial place of deities. > Kuo notes that the look-flesh creature \\"is a mass of flesh which looks like > the liver of an ox; it has two eyes. Even though you eat it, it is never > really consumed, because it grows again, and is born again in the same form > as it was before.\\" This myth may constitute a utopian idea of a never-ending > supply of meat, from the perspective of the inhabitants of poor rural areas. > (2000: 237) The Shanhaijing commentary of Guo Pu (276-324) provides invaluable information about the shirou and turou ÂúüËÇâ. > It is a lump of meat in the shape of an ox liver. There are two eyes in it. > It can be eaten as food. More of them can be found. Such things are called > Feng and are edible. People do not know this. There is also another thing in > the sea called Turou that is pure black and five cun in width. It is as big > as an arm of an infant. There is an abdomen but no mouth and eyes. It has 30 > legs. It can be stir-fried and taken as food. This is something like a cross > between a worm and a fish, and is similar to Feng. (tr. Luo 2003: 4132) Feng also appears in the Shanhaijing mythic name fengshi (Â∞ÅÁü≥, \\"fief stone\\"), for example (tr. Birrell 2000: 87), \\"[On Mount Accord], the yufu jade is abundant on its summit, as well as copious amounts of bloodstone and fief- stone.\\" The Shanhaijing commentary of Hao Yixing (ÈÉùÊáøË°å, 1757‚Äì1825) quotes the (c. 533-544 CE) Qimin Yaoshu (tr. Birrell 2000: 218), \\"The stone is medicinal. It tastes sweet and is not poisonous.\\" Zhang Hua's (c. 290 CE) Bowuzhi \\"Record of the Investigation of Things\\" (tr. Greatrex 1987: 97) says, \\"In the land of Yuexi/Yuesui there is a cow that does not die if you cut a piece of meat off it. After some days the flesh has grown back again as before.\\" Yuexi/Yuesui commandery was around present-day Xichang, Sichuan. The (c. 320 CE) Baopuzi, written by the Jin Dynasty Daoist scholar Ge Hong, mentions R√≤uzhƒ´ (ËÇâËäù, \\"meat/flesh excrescences\\") in two contexts. Ge Hong's \\"A Taoist Library\\" (Ware 1966: 313, 381) lists the illustrated text Ruozhitu ËÇâËäùÂúñ, which is no longer extant. \\"The Genie's Pharmacopia\\" (‰ªôËó•, tr. Ware 1966: 179) categorizes zhi (Ëäù \\"a legendary numinous mushroom; Ganoderma; excrescence\\"), \\"There are five types of excrescences: rock [Áü≥Ëäù], wood [Êú®Ëäù], herb [ËçâËäù], flesh [ËÇâËäù], and the tiny [ËèåËäù, jun Ëèå means \\"mushroom; fungus; bacterium; germ\\"]\\", and each of them has 120 species. The text lists six kinds of rouzhi \\"flesh excrescences\\" that will give one the invulnerability and longevity associated with Daoist xian. Here are two examples. > The ten-thousand-year-old hoptoad is said to have horns on its head, while > under its chin there is a double-tiered figure 8 written in red. It must be > captured at noon on the fifth day of the fifth moon and dried in the shade > for a hundred days. A line drawn on the ground with its left root will > become a running stream. When its left foreleg is carried on the person, it > will ward off all types of weapons. If an enemy shoots at you, the bow and > arrow will both turn against the archer. The thousand-year-old bat is as > white as snow. When perching, it hangs head down because its brain is heavy. > If both of these creatures are obtained, dried in the shade, powdered, and > taken, a body can live for forty thousand years. > If in the mountains you should come across a little man seven or eight > inches tall riding in a palanquin or on a horse, it will be a flesh > excrescence. By seizing and taking it you will immediately become a genie. > (tr. Ware 1966: 184) The Zazhi ÈõúÂøó \\"Miscellaneous Notes\\" by the Song dynasty official Jiang Linji Ê±üÈÑ∞Âπæ (1005-1060) records that the Neo-Confucian teacher Xu Ji ÂæêÁ©ç (1028-1103) found a Feng in Luzhou (modern Anhui). > Mr. Xu Ji [ÂæêÁ©ç] once picked up a small baby at the riverside in Lu Zhou. > There were no fingers on its hands and there was no blood in its body. He > was afraid of it and buried it in the ground. This was actually Feng as > recorded in the book Baize Tu. Eating such a thing will increase one's > physical strength. (tr. Luo 2003: 4132) The (c. 3rd century) Baize tu (ÁôΩÊæ§Âúñ, \\"Diagrams of the Baize 'White Marsh' Spirit\\") is no longer fully extant, but is identified with a Dunhuang manuscript (P2682). The (1547) Xihu Zhi (Ë•øÊπñÂøó \\"West Lake Record\\") by Ming dynasty scholar Tian Rucheng (Áî∞Ê±ùÊàê, 1503-1557) uses the name Taisui. > When Dung Biaoyi [Ëë£Ë°®ÂÑÄ] dismantled a house and dug up the earth, something > like a lump of meat was found. A Taoist master said this was Taisui. It was > harmless. So it was abandoned. (tr. Luo 2003: 4132) Li Shizhen's (1578) Bencao Gangmu classic Chinese materia medica includes the Feng under Chapter 51, which describes medicines derived from yu (Á¶∫ \\"monkeys\\") and kuai (ÊÄ™ \\"supernatural creatures\\") such as the wangliang (È≠çÈ≠é \\"a demon that eats the organs of corpses\\") and penghou (ÂΩ≠‰æØ \\"a tree spirit that resembles a black tailless dog\\"). The Feng entry quotes the Shanhaijing with Guo's commentary, the Zazhi, and Xihu Zhi. Bernard Read's translation (1931, no. 407) glosses the Feng as \\"a naiad\\" and says, \\"This refers to a class of peculiar organisms such as the sea cucumber or anemones to which were accredited supernatural qualities, based upon the supposition that they were spiritual beings.\\" The sea cucumber and sea anemone are both marine animals, as is the turou. Modern revival For 2,000 years, the Feng creature (a.k.a. Taisui, Rouzhi, etc.) has been an obscure aspect of Chinese mythology, but in the late 20th century, Chinese media began reporting a series of fake Feng findings. In modern context, counterfeit and imitation goods made in China are so common that English borrowed the Chinese loanword shanzhai. Most of the alleged Feng findings have been restricted to Chinese-language sources, often with extraordinary pictures (Baidu Baike 2014). For instance, construction workers near L√ºshunkou District of Dalian dug out a 78-kilogram lump of fatty meat, which they sold to a Mr. Sun (Â≠ô) for 20,000 yuan (about $3,200), who later began selling \\"Taisui\\" mineral water. The Xinhua reporter, who inspected Sun's \\"Taisui\\" kept in a water-filled tank, said it was about 40 cm wide, resembled white pig fat wrapped in a brown and yellow skin, and felt like sauced beef tendon (Xinhua 2014). One \\"Feng\\" story received international attention in June 2012. Xi'an Television reported that villagers digging a well had found a \\"Roulingzhi\\", which was being kept in a bucket of water. The reporter who handled the object described as a fleshy monster with a mouth and nose (ABC News 2012), (Huffington Post 2012), (Xi'an TV 2012). However, after viewers identified it as a fleshlight sex toy with a vagina and anus, the story became an internet meme in China, and the station issued an apology (The Mirror 2012). Comparative mythology Legends about a \\"lump of flesh\\" are culturally widespread. In Chinese mythology (Eberhard 1968: 450, 231, 438, 300), the world-creator Hundun resembled a lump of flesh; the nine sons of the dragon were born as a limbless lump of flesh, split into nine parts and thrown them into the river, where they became dragon kings; the hero King Zhao of Zhou was born as a lump of flesh that had to be split; and the dead sometimes appear as a lump of flesh, like the Taisui. In a Chinese fairy tale, The Pretty Little Calf was born as the third wife's son, but the first and second wives claimed he was a lump of flesh, and tried to kill him by drowning and feeding to a water buffalo. Examples can be found in many cultures. The Indian Mahabharata tells how Gandhari, the wife of Dhritarashtra, wished for 100 sons, and after two years of pregnancy gave birth to a lump of flesh, which were cut into 101 pieces and placed in jars, and developed into 100 sons and a daughter. The Tamil saint Thirumalisai Alvar was born as a limbless lump of flesh after twelve months in the womb, abandoned by his parents, and returned to life by Vishnu. The creation of man in the Qur'an (22:5) says, \\"We first created you from dust, then from a sperm drop, then from clotted blood, then a lump of flesh [mudghah], both shaped and unshaped, so that We might manifest to you [Our power]\\". In Welsh mythology, Lleu Llaw Gyffes was born from a lump of flesh dropped by Gwydion, and concealed in a chest until he matured. In Manx folklore, if a Tarroo-ushtey water bull mates with a cow, it only calves a lump of flesh and skin without bones.

He enrolled at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Napoli in 1853.Biography from the Enciclopedia Treccani. Later, he studied with Gabriele Smargiassi, Giuseppe Mancinelli and the Palizzi brothers (Filippo and Giuseppe), painters in the Naturalistic style.Brief biography @ the Galleria Recta. He had his first exhibition in 1855 at the \\"\\"Real Museo Borbonico\\". The Battle of Dogali (1896) In 1860, however, he became fascinated with Giuseppe Garibaldi and enlisted in the \\"Guardia Nazionale\\" to help eliminate the brigantaggio; a major step in the reunification of Italy. His experiences had a decisive influence on his artistic career. A brief stay in Florence after his service brought him into contact with the Macchiaioli, who also had some influence. In 1863, one of his paintings was purchased by King Victor Emmanuel II.Brief biography @ Libero. In 1865, he moved to Rome then, in 1867, to Venice. In 1870, his admiration for Gustave Courbet led him to Paris. He was determined to meet Courbet, which he did and, while he was there, discovered the works of Th√©odore G√©ricault. In 1888, he was commissioned by the Italian government to create a monumental canvas depicting the Battle of Dogali (1887). After reading about the geography and local customs, he moved to Massawa to inspect the battle site in person and remained for almost five years to complete the painting. While there, he also created landscapes and portraits of the local people. In 1900, he was appointed to succeed his old teacher, Filippo Palizzi, as Professor at the Institute in Naples. After that, his productivity declined; although he made a few trips to Sicily to paint landscapes. A street in Naples has been named after him.

It was built from to . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Bellmount is a small timber cottage constructed in 1880 for Martin McLeod, a bank messenger for the Union Bank of Australia. Spring Hill first developed in the 1850s and 1860s following the subdivision of crown land north of the town centre. Unlike other suburbs, Spring Hill evolved almost entirely into a residential suburb that had very little commercial or industrial base. Social segregation between the rich and the poor arose immediately in the area due to the undulating topography of the land. The elite built superior residences along the ridges of Wickham and Gregory Terraces, taking advantage of the views, breezes and good natural drainage. In comparison, the poor built simple timber houses on small blocks of land in the hollows adjacent to the ridges. St Pauls Terrace (formerly known as Leichhardt Street), was a lesser ridge road that was taken up by various institutions such as churches and schools. The 1880s boom period saw the development of more elite residences and boarding houses in the Spring Hill area. Amongst the working-class people, pyramid-roofed type dwellings such as Bellmount became particularly popular and continued to dominate less prestigious domestic building until the 1890s. Deed of Grant for a 2-acre allotment along Leichhardt Street was granted to David McConnel as early as 1853. The land was subdivided into several allotments in 1872 of which a allotment was purchased by William Cookslerf. Further subdivision of that allotment resulted in three similar parcels of land, one of which was bought by Martin McLeod in 1880. On the site, now known as 71 St Pauls Terrace, McLeod erected a typical four roomed timber worker's cottage with a pyramid type roof. The cottage was later extended by the addition of two more rooms at the rear. Physical detailing of the attic within the main pyramid roof structure suggests that it may also have been added later. The property remained with the McLeod family for three generations until 1976. The building is currently used as offices.  Description  Bellmount is located on the southern side of St Pauls Terrace, opposite Brisbane Central State School, and amongst a small group of timber houses. The dwelling is essentially a typical four-roomed pyramid roofed cottage that has been extended at the rear. The building occupies almost the full width of the property and is set close to the street boundary. Due to the slope of the site, the house is elevated on timber stumps at the front but set close to the ground at the rear. The apex of the steeply pitched corrugated iron roof is decorated with a timber finial and a single dormer style window projects from the roof towards the street. A skylight has been fitted to the rear slope of the main roof. Half-round guttering, fixed by metal brackets, has been used for the main roof. The external walls of the original house are sheathed in twelve inch chamferboards and most of the original four-paned sash windows remain substantially intact. The extension at the rear of the building is clad in weatherboards and has multi-paned sash windows, which match the dormer window. The front verandah of the house also has a hipped roof that has a convex profile. The verandah has timber posts, brackets and top rails and cast iron balustrading. A pair of latticed screen doors provides access to the verandah and an early louvred infill panel exists at the verandah's southern end. In comparison to the front, the rear verandah is crudely constructed and has been infilled with a variety of claddings such as corrugated iron, lattice and fibreglass sheeting. The floor of the back verandah is brick paved. The building's original core is square and comprises two bedrooms on the north side, with a combined former parlour and drawing room on the other side. Two later built rooms at the rear provide accommodation for a kitchen and an extra bedroom. The attic bedroom, which is located in the main roof space, is accessed via a narrow set of timber stairs located in the former drawing room. A bathroom has been created by the partial enclosure of the back verandah. The internal walls of the house are single skinned and lined with vertical timber boards which are wide in the original section but narrower in the rear extension.  Heritage listing  Bellmount was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Bellmount, built in 1880, is important for demonstrating the early inner suburban development of Brisbane, particularly Spring Hill. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The attic is an unusual example of space utilisation rarely adopted in Queensland due to high internal temperatures. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The house is a substantially intact example of the typical four-roomed pyramid roofed worker's cottage that dominated domestic building during the 1880s to 1890s. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The house plays a significant role in the nineteenth century street scape of St Pauls Terrace, contributing aesthetically with its scale, form and use of materials.

It was built . It is also known as Allandoon and Cooee. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Moody's Cottages were constructed probably in the mid-1870s. They comprise a pair of semi-detached brick houses (Cooee and an unnamed neighbour) and an adjacent, detached brick house called Allandoon. William Moody, a letter carrier employed by the Brisbane Post Office, acquired subdivisions 23 and 24 of portion 236, parish of North Brisbane, in early 1870. Whether any buildings existed on the site, which Moody had purchased from William John Farmer Cooksley, a Brisbane builder, is not known. Although directories reveal Moody was resident in Brisbane by 1874, he is not listed specifically as living in Victoria Street until 1876. In September 1874 the property was re-surveyed into three equal resubdivisions by Richard Gailey, licensed surveyor and a leading Brisbane architect, and it is likely that he was the designer of the cottages. The survey plan was signed by both William Moody and Thomas Spilsbury, a compositor and later Queen Street confectioner, whose purchase of resubdivision 3 from Moody was registered immediately the survey was completed. On this property Spilsbury raised a mortgage of , which may have financed the construction of the three houses, in partnership with Moody. The mortgage was released in April 1876, and the resubdivision was resold to Moody in May of the same year. Little is known of Moody's background which might account for how a postman, promoted to mail sorter in the 1880s, was able to become the owner of three brick houses. Moody's houses remained the property of his daughters Susannah, Hannah and Margaret Jane until 1949. Allandoon was renovated in the 1980s, and remains a private residence. In 1988 the semi-detached houses were converted into a house and gallery/studio by well known Brisbane artist Rick Everingham, and the name Cooee is generally applied to the pair.  Description  = The Duplex (Cooee and neighbour)= Cooee and its unnamed neighbour originally formed a pair of semi-detached, single-storeyed brick cottages with separate, steeply pitched gabled roofs containing attic spaces lit by dormer windows. The galvanised iron roofs are likely to have been shingled originally. The foundations are of Brisbane tuff and the exterior and party walls are brick on edge ['rats nest' bond], a cheaper form of construction seen occasionally in surviving Brisbane buildings of the 1860s and 1870s, such as the 1863 Callender House (Theosophical Society Building) on Wickham Terrace. The buildings follow the slope down Victoria Street, with the southeastern house higher than its attached neighbour. Both houses have narrow front verandahs adjacent to the street pavement. These have separate convex galvanised iron roofs, timber posts with replaced fretwork brackets, cast-aluminium balustrading and brick end walls of English bond construction. Timber lattice has been added to the verandah of the higher house. No. 8, the top house and the larger of the two, consists of a central brick core with four rooms, an end hallway which leads through the house to an attached kitchen/dining room and bathroom (twentieth century additions), and two attic bedrooms. French doors open from the two front rooms onto the verandah. Internal walls are of brick or vertically jointed pine boards, and cedar doors with fanlights are a feature. No.12 is a smaller building consisting of two main rooms, attic bedroom, and hallway with a pressed metal ceiling which leads to the rear of the house, where twentieth century kitchen, dining room and bathroom facilities have been added. In 1988 false ceilings were installed in the main rooms to accommodate track lighting, and the house was converted into an art gallery, the attic room becoming an artist's studio. By early 1989 the pair had become a house and gallery/studio with the removal of a section of the brick party wall. Despite some alteration to both structure and fabric, the former semi-detached houses retain their basic form and materials, present a reasonably intact exterior to the street, and are of a housing type rare in Brisbane. = Allandoon = Moody's Cottages - Allandoon, 2009 Allandoon is a small, single-storeyed brick house, rectangular in shape, with a gabled roof of corrugated iron which probably was shingled originally. The foundations are of Brisbane tuff and the earliest section of the building is constructed of brick on edge ('rats nest' bond), the same technique used in the adjacent semi-detached cottages. A narrow front verandah, which has a convex corrugated iron roof, timber posts, fretwork brackets, cast-aluminium balustrading and brick end walls of English bond construction, abuts the street pavement. Internally the house consists of four main rooms opening off a central hallway, with later kitchen, dining and bathroom facilities added at the rear. The house presents a reasonably intact exterior to the street, and is painted in heritage shades.  Heritage listing  Moody's Cottages was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Moody's Cottages are significant historically as important surviving evidence of the growth of Spring Hill as a dormitory suburb in the 1860s and 1870s, and in particular of the area between Leichhardt Street and Gregory Terrace. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. They are rare Brisbane examples of masonry working-class homes of the 1870s, rarer still for their brick and stone construction, brick on edge work, and gable style. They include a rare example of 1870s masonry, semi-detached working class housing in Brisbane. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. They include a rare example of 1870s masonry, semi-detached working class housing in Brisbane. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The cottages have aesthetic value and are important for their streetscape contribution.

Life and career Henry Ford, from Cranbrook in Kent, joined the University of Oxford on 9 July 1776, at the age of 23, matriculating as a member of Pembroke College. He later became a member of Christ Church and obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1780. He was appointed Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic straight after obtaining his degree. He was not the only candidate: William Jones, a lawyer and linguist, also applied. He had a reputation as a radical, and although Ford was \\"a comparative nonentity\\" (in the words of Jones's biographer), he had the advantage of having married the niece of a bishop, and so \\"nepotism and politics triumphed\\". Ford obtained his Master of Arts degree in 1783. When Matthew Lamb, the Principal of Magdalen Hall, resigned in 1788, Ford was his successor. He obtained a doctorate in civil law in the same year: it was customary at the time for the heads of colleges and halls to have a doctoral degree. He then \\"retired as much as he could from the public view\\", wrote one historian of Hertford College (a successor institution to Magdalen Hall), adding that \\"it was his excessive shyness that gained for him a certain notoriety and a place among the early Oxford caricatures.\\" In addition to his Oxford positions, he was also an ordained priest in the Church of England. He was a residentiary canon of Hereford Cathedral, rector of Cradley and vicar of Woolhope and Fownhope in Herefordshire. These were positions given to him by his wife's uncle, John Butler, the Bishop of Hereford. After Butler's death in 1802, Ford (who was the bishop's executor) arranged for a memorial tablet to be placed in the cathedral. Ford died on 26 July 1813, and was buried in Hereford Cathedral; a memorial to him was placed in the cloisters. He was succeeded in his positions as Lord Almoner's Professor and Principal of Magdalen Hall by John Macbride. Alumni Oxonienses, a 19th-century register of students and academics at the university, records that Ford had two sons, Charles and Frederick, who both studied at Oxford. He and his wife, Mary, also had a daughter, Anna Louisa. Mary died on 18 December 1831 \\"in her 80th year\\". An obituary in The Gentleman's Magazine praised Ford's \\"great and varied acquirements in general science\\", his \\"profound knowledge of Oriental literature\\" and his \\"unaffected piety, gentleness, and benevolence.\\" It also described him as \\"an affectionate husband and tender father.\\" Notes References Category:1753 births Category:1813 deaths Category:Alumni of Pembroke College, Oxford Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:English Arabists Category:18th-century English Anglican priests Category:19th-century English Anglican priests Category:Lord Almoner's Professors of Arabic (University of Oxford) Category:Principals of Magdalen Hall, Oxford ","title":"Henry Ford (professor)"},{"id":"45252874","text":"Calgary Scientific is a technology company focused on access and interaction with large graphical data files and applications, without moving or copying the data.

The American media franchise, The X-Files, created by Chris Carter uses inspirations and sources from other fictional media as well as many real-life paranormal cases that have been alleged/documented, though not necessarily proven to be true. The show's creator Chris Carter stated: Many of our ideas spring from actual accounts, essays, pieces in journals that we expand by posting \\"what if\\".THE X-FILES BOOK OF THE UNEXPLAINED (Volume Two) by Jane Goldman Fictional inspirations =Film= The X-Files also borrows themes and settings, both major or minor, from popular movies during or around the same time era that covered the same or similar topics of the paranormal, government conspiracy, and alien contact. The X-Files pilot episode's ending draws inspiration from Raiders of the Lost Ark, which shows the government archiving top secret items and documents kept away from the public. The show's early episodes borrow elements from various films including Close Encounters of the Third Kind, JFK, and The Night Strangler. Amongst other films that the shows first season episodes borrow from are It, based on the popular horror novel of the same name by Stephen King. Additional inspirational films include Poltergeist (1982), Ghostbusters (1984), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Die Hard (1988), Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982), The Thing (1982), Predator (1987), Moonraker (1979), The Entity (1982), Cocoon (1985), The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988), the Terminator films (1984), Project A (1983), Congo (1995), The Exorcist (1973), and The Omen (1976). These are among many other films that the series borrows from or includes themes and settings from them. =Television= The show's darker tones and settings also borrows from other TV shows with similar themes and settings. The concept of the show borrows from another TV series Twin Peaks. The inspiration for one of the main characters Dana Scully and her role at the FBI borrows from The Silence of the Lambs. Her relationship to Fox Mulder draws elements from the 1960s TV series The Avengers. Alongside many real-life documented cases dealing with the concepts of alien abduction, alien invasion and UFOs, The X-Files franchise also borrows these same themes from other TV shows that have also covered the subject. Such shows go back to the 1950s, 60s and 70s when such topics were popular and massively discussed in the American media. Television series of those times such as The Quatermass Experiment from the 1950s, The Invaders from the 1960s, Kolchak: The Night Stalker from the 1970s, V: The Final Battle from the 1980s all served as inspirations.What's His Name? John Fiedler: The Man the Face the Voice by Elizabeth Messina Non- fictional inspirations Prior to conceiving The X-Files in 1993, Chris Carter traveled the world writing for Surfer and read a report claiming that some 3.7 million Americans may have been abducted by aliens. While the American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) does not have a branch that investigates paranormal cases as seen in The X-Files universe, the organization was involved in assisting the United States Army and the United States Air Force (USAF) investigate UFO sightings going back to the 1950s when the phenomenon first became popular. =Episodes directly inspired by true cases= The episode from the third season of the show, \\"Jose Chung's From Outer Space\\", draws inspirations from real-life alien abduction cases, including that of Barney and Betty Hill and also includes the use of hypnosis to revive the memories of these alleged abductions.

He suggested using an unencrypted emergency warning, in the hope of provoking a Japanese response, thus establishing whether Midway was a target. Early years Born in Stockport, New York, Holmes was the son of Johan Erik Jonasson Holmes, a Finnish immigrant who worked as a fireman in a paper mill, and Esther F. Holmes.US Federal Census, 1900 Wilfred Holmes graduated from the US Naval Academy, Annapolis, 1922, and had a master's degree in engineering from Columbia University. He served as a line officer in the Navy, in submarines. He wrote submarine adventure stories for the Saturday Evening Post and technical articles under the pen name Alec Hudson.University of Hawaii biography of Wilfred HolmesJasper Holmes in \\"Maritime Texas\\" One of the former, \\"Rendezvous\\", imagined an air raid in which flying boats were refueled by submarines at a Pacific atoll, allowing them to reach targets which would normally be well outside their range. This scenario would later play out in real life in the form of Operation K, a March 1942 attack by Japanese H8Ks on Pearl Harbor. Unlike the massive carrier-based surprise attack three months earlier, this only involved two aircraft and failed due to bad weather. Naval Intelligence chief Edwin T. Layton later concluded that the Japanese had made use of the idea from \\"Rendezvous\\" when planning the operation. Holmes retired from the Navy in 1936 because of arthritis of the spine, and joined the faculty of the University of Hawaii. Intelligence officer In 1941, Lieutenant Holmes was recalled to duty and assigned to Station HYPO, which was breaking Japanese codes, especially their naval cipher JN-25. He was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on February 25, 1942. By May 1942, US Naval Intelligence knew that the Japanese were planning an attack at a spot they called AF, but did not know what AF signified. Navy cryptanalyst Joseph Rochefort thought AF was Midway Island. Holmes had the idea of faking a water supply failure on Midway. He suggested using an unencrypted emergency warning, in the hope of provoking a Japanese response, thus establishing whether AF was Midway. Holmes' ruse worked and led to the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Midway. Holmes was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. Continuing to work at Station HYPO, Holmes was promoted to Commander on May 8, 1943, and then to Captain on December 19, 1944.

Sprague de Camp. It was first published in the magazine Unknown for September, 1940.Laughlin, Charlotte, and Levack, Daniel J. H. De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography. San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, page 176. It first appeared in book form in the collection The Reluctant Shaman and Other Fantastic Tales (Pyramid, 1970); it later appeared in the collection The Best of L. Sprague de Camp (Doubleday, 1978), and the anthology Bestiary! (Ace Books, 1985) The story has been translated into French and German. Plot summary Folklorist R. B. Wilcox, collecting material for a book on the legends of upstate New York, queries Aceria Jones, a Gahato tea room hostess, regarding the village's rumored haunted woodpile. Aceria dismisses the story, but suggestively tells him she would be extremely grateful if he could point her to a job in the vicinity of a Norway maple (Acer platanoides). Moralistically rejecting her advances, Wilcox leaves, unknowingly killing his chance of getting the inside story. The history of the woodpile goes back to a mansion built by 19th century Swiss immigrant August Rudli, who imported two Norway maples to grace his estate. A century later the house had gone back to nature, but one of the maples still thrived, until all the hardwood timber on the lot was sold and logged in the winter of 1938. The logs cut from the tree end up in Gahato at Dan Pringle's sawmill, where the next spring they are sawn into boards and stored in Pile No. 1027. The trouble starts the following summer, when Pile 1027 is to be consolidated with Pile 1040 in the wake of a large timber order depleting the top half of each. Mill workers Henri Michod and Olaf Bergen are spooked when the remaining lumber in Pile 1027 begins swaying beneath them for no logical reason. Consequently, they stop work, whereupon their irate foreman Joe Larochelle assigns the job to another millhand. After he and Joe also experience the pile's uncanny behavior, the latter ties down the offending boards and the crew trucks the rest of the wood over to Pile 1040. When they return to load the remainder, however, the boards start flying out of their hands, now seemingly eager to go into the truck. The lumbermen watch in astonishment as the boards load themselves and the truck moves of its own accord over to Pile 1040, where it dumps its load. Joe goes to Dan Pringle's office to tell what happened; Pringle suspects it some sort of trick perpetrated by union organizers. The two return to the pile, where Pringle encounters a young woman who, to his disquiet, seems invisible and inaudible to anyone but him. Dismissing Joe, he confronts her alone. The woman identifies herself as Aceria, a sphendamniad, or maple spirit, as distinct from dryads, which are oak spirits. She was hibernating when her tree was cut down, but is still bound to its remains, as she can only live in a Norway maple, and there are no others in the vicinity. Pringle is unsympathetic. He regards the lumber as his property, to be sold off like any other batch of wood. When Aceria warns him she will never let him send the boards away, he pugnaciously accepts the challenge. In the days that follow, the pile's supernatural reputation grows as Aceria invisibly undermines all efforts by Pringle's employees to move the wood, and begins to sabotage his operation in other ways. She even goes so far as to fool his wife Helen into thinking she is a mortal woman having an affair with him. Pringle refuses to give in. He supervises the next attempt to move the boards himself, offering time and a half to his men. Aceria counterattacks by animating a cloud of sawdust, first as a dust storm and then in the form of a horrifying flying monster. The workers abandon Pringle. That night he and Joe return to the pile with kerosene and a blowtorch, determined to burn it rather than surrender to Aceria. She responds with the ultimate threat; to organize the mill workers into a union. Since she is a spirit able to materialize and disappear at will, Pringle will have no way to stop her. In despair, he finally surrenders. They reach an accommodation. Pringle sells the whole pile at a cut rate to the owner of The Pines tea room, Earl Delacroix, who needs a new dance floor. As part of the deal, Delacroix has to hire Aceria as hostess. Now, by day, she works in the tea room and dances with the male customers, while at night she returns \\"home,\\" merging herself with the floorboards. But she would still prefer a living tree, and so asks all her acquaintances, sooner or later, if they happen to know where a Norway maple grows. Reception Everett F.

He served as missionary bishop of the Episcopal Church (United States) for the Episcopal Diocese of Guatemala and later as bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Colorado. He was an Evangelical and was considered a moderate theological conservative. He supported women's ordination but opposed active homosexuality.Vale - The Rt. Rev. William Frey, Anglican Ink, 17 October 2020 Ecclesiastical career He was ordained to the priesthood in 1956 in the Episcopal Diocese of Colorado. He holds a BA in Spanish and a minor in French from the University of Colorado, and a Master of Divinity from the Philadelphia Divinity School. He became a missionary in Latin America in 1962 and was consecrated as missionary bishop of the Diocese of Guatemala in 1967. In 1971 he and his family were evicted from that country for making public statements about peacemaking during an undeclared civil war. His books The Dance of Hope (2010) and Cancelada: Why They Threw us out of Guatemala (2012), give details about his family's eviction from Guatemala. In 1972 Frey was elected bishop coadjutor of the Diocese of Colorado and then installed as bishop of the diocese the following year. During that time there was a dispute over the use of the Episcopal Church's revised Book of Common Prayer. Frey seized St. Mark's Church, Denver, by downgrading it from a parish to a mission, citing what he described as an inflammatory article by the church's pastor as proof that the priest intended to secede from the diocese, which the priest denied. This was reported to be apparently the first time an Episcopal parish had been dissolved in the United States in a dispute over forms and rites of worship. He also had a connection to actress Ann B. Davis from TV's The Brady Bunch. In 1976, Davis sold her home in Los Angeles to move to Denver, Colorado, where she joined the Episcopal communal house of approximately 18 members headed by Frey and his wife, Barbara. Davis was part of that household, which relocated to Pennsylvania and finally Texas, until her death in 2014.McCaughan, Pat. \\"RIP: Ann B. Davis, Brady Bunch‚Äôs ‚ÄòAlice,‚Äô will be ‚Äòsorely‚Äô missed,\\" Episcopal News Service, 2 June 2014. In 1985, he was one of the four candidates to be Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, but lost to more liberal bishop Edmond Browning.Vale - The Rt. Rev. William Frey, Anglican Ink, 17 October 2020 In 1990, after 18 years in Colorado, he resigned as bishop to become the dean of Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry in Ambridge, Pennsylvania. He stepped down as dean in 1996 and moved to the San Antonio region in Texas to retire, but remained active in ministry. After the resignation of Bishop Jeffrey N. Steenson, Frey was asked to be assisting bishop for the Episcopal Diocese of the Rio Grande. During his time as assisting bishop of Rio Grande he debated Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori. What was billed as a debate, with Frey representing traditional, orthodox Christianity, took place on December 12 of 2009. Some conservative observers were disappointed by Frey's lack of willingness to press Jefferts Schori on her former statements that called into question basic tenets of Christianity, like Jesus' resurrection from the dead. He also served as interim rector of Christ Church, San Antonio, Texas. He was a member of Communion Partners, an Episcopalian group which opposed the 77th General Episcopal Convention's decision to authorize the blessing of same-sex marriages in 2012. The measure to allow the blessing of same-sex unions won by a 111‚Äì41 vote with 3 abstentions. Frey's wife Barbara died in 2014.

Although many of these are a common feature in pre-war building stocks, these housing types have become much less common. Background The term ‚Äúmissing middle‚Äù became popular in American and Canadian urban planning in the 2010s to describe a housing type that was many decades ago common in these countries but is now in many cases ‚Äúmissing‚Äù. Many forms of what is now described as ‚Äúmissing middle‚Äù housing was built before the 1940s including two-flats in Chicago, rowhomes in Brooklyn, Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, two-family homes or ‚Äútriple-decker‚Äù homes in Boston, and bungalow courts in California. Post-WW- II, housing in the United States trended significantly toward single-family with zoning making it difficult to build walkable medium density housing in many areas reducing supply of the now ‚Äúmissing‚Äù middle. The resurgence of missing middle housing is due to many factors including resurgent demand for this type of housing, demand for housing in amenity rich walkable neighborhoods, the necessity of housing affordability, environmental efforts to support walk-ability and transit oriented developments, and changing demographic trends. The American Association for Retired Persons (ARRP) released new report, which showed that more and more, Americans want to ‚Äúage in place,‚Äù and need easy access to services and amenities available in walkable, urban, transit-oriented communities. Millennials have been shown to drive less, and seek housing choices in walkable neighborhoods close to transit. The numbers of automobile miles traveled increased each year between 1946 and 2004; today Americans drive less than 2004, and no more per person than in 1996. The decline in driving is most striking among young people aged 16 to 34, who drove 23% fewer miles on average in 2009 than their age group did in 2001. ‚ÄúMillennials prefer amenity rich housing choices. These amenities are within walking distance,‚Äù presented Howard Ways of the Redevelopment Authority of Prince George's County in Washington D.C. ‚ÄúThey prefer smaller units with open floor plans and are not interested in yard work at all.‚Äù Small Housing B.C. has stated that \\"The structure of the traditional North American suburb has failed to live up to the expectations of many who settled in suburban neighbourhoods, and new ways are being sought to re-engineer suburban living and re-build those settlement patterns.\\"  Design  Missing-middle housing comes in a variety of building types and densities but may be characterized by a scale similar to that of single family housing, location in a walkable neighborhood, and a smaller amount of parking. Forms of missing middle housing may include side-by-side duplexes, stacked duplexes, bungalow courts, accessory dwelling units (carriage houses, basement apartments, etc.), fourplexes, multiplexes, townhomes, courtyard apartments, and live/work units. These building types typically have a residential unit density in the range of 16 to 30 units per acre but are often perceived as being less dense because they are smaller in scale. Because of its scale, missing middle housing may mix into single family neighborhoods, act as an end-grain of a single family housing block, act as a transition between higher density housing and single family housing, or act as a transition from a mixed use area to a single- family area. The resulting density may support broader community desires, including walkable retail, amenities, public transportation, and increased ‚Äúfeet on the street‚Äù.  Benefits  Missing middle is tends to become naturally affordable rental housing as it ages, and provides supports a level of density that supports the shops, restaurants, and transit that are associated with walkable neighborhoods. Missing middle housing units are usually smaller units than single family homes because they share a lot with other homes, which results in lower per-unit land costs. It is also one of the cheapest forms of housing to produce because it is typically low-rise, low parking, wood-frame construction, which avoids expensive concrete podiums. Since the construction and building materials are comparatively less complicated than larger mid-and high-rise structures, a larger pool of small- scale and local home builders can participate in the creation this form of housing. The efficient use of land and infrastructure may be financially productive for municipalities with more people paying taxes per acre for comparatively little infrastructure. Missing Middle Housing offers greater choice in housing types that still blend into existing single family neighborhoods, unlike mid-rise apartment buildings. They are typically more affordable than a single-family home because they are smaller and share communal parking and lawns. Lloyd Alter of Treehugger says there is a certain amount of density required for building green cities that support transit- oriented development: \\"I have made the case that you don't want it too high; that there is a Goldilocks density that's just right. One form of housing that gets close to Goldilocks is the stacked townhouse.\\" Examples Several states have adopted or proposed legislation aimed at increasing the stock of missing middle housing with Oregon notably adopting such legislation in 2019. Many municipalities are updating their land-use and zoning regulations to better support missing middle housing. Changes to land use regulations to support missing middle housing may also include changes such as form-based- codes, transit-oriented development, and other updates. Portland, Oregon, has a number of historic Missing Middle housing types located throughout the city, most of which are duplexes, that were built before the 1920s before the city's first zoning plan was approved. Zoning for single-family homes was expanded in the 1950s and the building of duplexes or triplexes largely became illegal in Portland. Some local developers are now advocating for these Missing Middle types, saying that they are key to building the bike-friendly neighborhoods Portland is known for. The Minneapolis, Minnesota Minneapolis 2040 plan calls for up-zones the city to allow two- and three-family buildings on what had been single-family lots, tripling the potential number of housing units in the city. Per the plan, the Minneapolis City council has adopted zoning updates to permit more missing middle housing. The new zoning in Minneapolis does not prohibit construction of single-family homes no neighborhoods in the city are zoned exclusively for single-family zoning. New duplexes and triplexes must be built within the existing building envelope, and up to two units can be added within that footprint to owner-occupied homes. Zoning changes also permit cluster development and accessory dwelling units while reducing parking requirements. The City of Seattle proposed to remove regulatory barriers in their Land Use Code to make it easier for property owners to create accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and increase the number and variety of housing choices in Seattle‚Äôs primarily single-family zones. Seattle has adopted zoning changes to promote missing middle housing including permitting accessory dwelling units and expanding where missing middle housing types are permitted. Many other communities across the Pacififc northwest are working to support missing middle housing types including Eugene, Olympia, Spokane, and Bellingham, and Tigard among others. Many communities of different sizes and locations are updating their land use regulations to support missing middle housing including smaller cities such as Bloomington, Indiana, and Canadian cities including Edmonton, Alberta among many others.

It was previously called Oriel Mostyn ('Oriel' is Welsh for 'Gallery') but was rebranded as simply Mostyn following its 2010 revamp. Background The roots of the gallery started with a Miss Clarence Whaite (daughter of the president of the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art), who in 1894 set up a meeting of 'lady artistes' at the 'Round room' in Conwy, after an agreement of a name for Miss Whaite's new Society; 'The Gwynedd Ladies' Art Society', Lady Augusta Mostyn, who presided at the meeting was the first to donate ¬£2.2s (~¬£1500 in 2019 after inflation) which made her the founding member.Cheshire Observer (Chester, Cheshire, England) 29 Dec 1894, Sat - Page 5 The gallery was re-established in 1978 in a building that was originally built for wealthy local arts benefactor and photographer, Lady Augusta Mostyn, in 1901. The original Mostyn Art Gallery ran from 1901 to 1913 and for two years housed works by Gwynedd Ladies Art Society (GLAS) who were denied membership of male dominated local art societies on the basis of their gender. The three (originally five) bay building, faced in red brick and terracotta, is Grade II listed, as a building by the Mostyn Estate architect, G. A. Humphreys, that helps define Llandudno. The same Edwardian building became available in the late 1970s and was proposed as the home of a new gallery for North Wales. It was officially opened on 11 August 1979. It reopened again in May 2010 after a ¬£5 million refurbishment, partly financed by a ¬£3 million grant from the Arts Council of Wales. The refurbishment of the original galleries and the new extension was by Ellis Williams Architects, and won the Gold Medal for Architecture from the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 2011. The gallery rebranded itself as Mostyn, dropping the word 'Oriel' and upsetting some local people by dropping the Welsh prefix. Mostyn is a charity registered in England and Wales (Mostyn Gallery Limited 507842).

The sequel to 2014's Red Rising, Golden Son continues to follow lowborn Darrow's plan to destroy the Society from within. It debuted at #6 on The New York Times Best Seller list and won the 2015 Goodreads Choice Award for Science Fiction. The third novel, Morning Star, was published in February 2016. Plot summary Darrow, now one of the Peerless Scarred and in the service of his enemy, Nero au Augustus, is poised to gain control of his own fleet of warships, which he knows will be useful to the Sons of Ares and their plan to undermine the Society. During his final exam at the Academy, Darrow faces off against Cassius's older brother, Karnus au Bellona, in an epic space battle. Darrow pulls a tactical move but underestimates Karnus and loses, resulting in hundreds of casualties. Karnus becomes praetor of his own fleet and all of Darrow's plans have unraveled. Defeated, Darrow returns to his quarters at the Academy and is set upon by Karnus and members of House Bellona, bent on revenge for Julian's death. After Darrow suffers from this humiliation and the loss to Karnus, Augustus releases Darrow from his contract and advises he will be auctioned to another House at the Summit, a gathering of the Great Houses on Luna. Without the protection of Augustus, Darrow is vulnerable to Bellona family whose matriarch has tasked them to murder Darrow and bring back his heart. Awaiting the end of his contract, Darrow is approached by Victra au Julii (Antonia's half-sister and one of Darrow's lieutenants at the Academy) who leads him to the Jackal, Adrius au Augustus, at a bar in Lost City. The Jackal was exiled by his father thanks to the manipulations of his advisor, Pliny, but has managed to create an empire of his own. He now controls 30% of all the media and is poised to use his power to influence a House to buy Darrow's contract and wishes to bring down the Sovereign and the Sons of Ares and place himself as the head of the Society. The Jackal offers a partnership with Darrow and proposes he becomes the face of the revolution. While discussing their plans, a Pink Darrow recognizes as Evey, a former pleasure slave of Mickey the Carver, enters the bar intent on assassinating the Jackal. Before Darrow can stop her, Evey sets off an explosion, and Darrow narrowly manages to save the Jackal. Darrow learns that Evey is working for Harmony, a leader of the Sons of Ares. Harmony reveals to Darrow that Dancer, his former mentor, has died but that Ares still has a mission for him. The Sons of Ares have planted explosives all over the cities of the Society, and Darrow has been tasked to set off an explosion at the Summit. Darrow is hesitant, but is convinced after Harmony shows a recording of Darrow's wife, Eo, speaking to her sister before she is executed. She asks her sister to hide a cradle from Darrow, revealing her pregnancy. Darrow's anger towards the Society is reignited and he accepts Harmony's assignment. At the Summit, Darrow prepares to carry out his plans and drugs his close friend, Roque au Fabii, in order to spare his life. He enters the gathering fully prepared to act, but at the last moment he realizes Eo would not have wanted for Darrow to be responsible for countless deaths. He devises a new plan, the best way to infiltrate the Society is not through violence among the Colors but through civil war among the Golds. Darrow challenges Cassius, who has arrived with Virginia \\"Mustang\\" au Augustus (Darrow's former love interest), to a duel to the death. Cassius, thought to be the better fighter, is bested by Darrow who has been secretly training with Razor Master, Lorn au Arcos. Darrow nearly kills Cassius but is stopped by the Sovereign, Octavia au Lune, revealing her favor for the Bellona family. The rules of the Society state that a duel to the death is final but the Sovereign demands Cassius's life be spared on a technicality. Darrow then defiantly cuts off Cassius's sword arm, causing chaos to erupt and disrupting the Sovereign's plans to wipe out the Augustus family. A full-scale massacre ensues, and many prominent families are murdered by rival Houses. Darrow narrowly escapes, but is taken into custody by Fitchner, now an Olympic Knight loyal to the Sovereign. The Sovereign proposes that Darrow enter her service. She tests him by giving him the option of playing a simple yet deadly game in which creatures called Oracles measure vital signs while two people ask questions of each other. If the Oracle senses a lie, it injects venom into the liar. Darrow agrees to play, and eventually catches her in a lie about her plans for the Augustans at the gala, while Mustang is present. Fitchner, the newly-appointed Rage Knight, saves the Sovereign from the venom. The Sovereign tries to explain to Mustang and Darrow the reasons for her plans. She laments Augustus' insubordination and states he is to blame for the revolution sparked by executing Eo. She believes if the ArchGovernor of Mars is killed and replaced by the Bellona, there will finally be peace on Mars for all Colors. Mustang, who had entered the service to the Sovereign in order to protect her family, is angered that the Sovereign plans to murder her father and her entire house, but pretends to acquiesce. Afterwards, she alerts Sevro au Barca, who organizes his Howlers and rescues Darrow and what remains of the Augustus family. They hold the Sovereign's grandson, Lysander, hostage to ensure they leave Luna safely but not before Quinn (a loyal Howler and Roque's lover) is severely wounded by Aja, the Sovereign's deadliest fury. Before they escape, Darrow is betrayed by his friend, Tactus, who frees Lysander and returns him to the Sovereign, taking their bargaining chip with him. Adrius performs surgery on the wounded Quinn, who is in a critical condition. Now on the run and allied with House Augustus and House Telemanus, Darrow formulates a plan to defeat the Sovereign and the Bellonas who now rule Mars. They attack the largest ship of the Sovereign's armada and incite the LowColors to murder the Golds on board. During the chaos, Darrow obtains the service of a Stained Obsidian, Ragnar, and renames the ship The Pax after his late friend. The victory is bittersweet, however, when they return to find that Quinn has died. This death further drives a wedge between Roque and Darrow. Later, Sevro reveals to Darrow that he was contacted by Ares and knows Darrow was born a Red. Darrow, convinced by a message from the still-mysterious Ares and the still-alive Dancer, is overcome with emotion and is grateful to share his burden with a close friend. Later, Darrow meets with Augustus's council and establishes that they must obtain more ships in order to defeat the Sovereign. Pliny believes their plans are fruitless and the only way to survive is to run to the farthest reaches of the solar system. Darrow believes he can convince his mentor Lorn to join the fight. He meets with Lorn who refuses to join Darrow, as he says he is now a man of peace and cares only for the safety of his family. Lorn then reveals that the Sovereign arrived before Darrow and provides him with a means of escape. However, Darrow was aware of the Sovereign's plans and advises Lorn that Roque has a host of ships lying in wait. Lorn is then forced to join Darrow as Aja and Tactus arrive with a squad of Praetorians. Prepared for battle, Darrow sets off land mines, injuring Aja and killing her team. While Aja dives into the sea, Tactus escapes, attempting to carry out the Sovereign's orders to kill Lorn's family. Darrow and Lorn pursue him and Darrow appeals to Tactus's trust in Darrow and need for Darrow's approval. After admitting he wants to come back and join him, Tactus lowers his weapon and embraces Darrow, but is killed by Lorn for threatening his family. When they return to their Fleet, Darrow learns from Mustang that Pliny has betrayed them and under the service of the Sovereign, has captured loyal house members and killed others. Darrow plans a rescue mission and storms Pliny's ship. He convinces the Peerless Scarred who guard Pliny to join him or die. In a gesture of their new shift in obedience, they kill Pliny. Afterwards, the Jackal broadcasts that Darrow has called for an Iron Rain. Houses from all over the solar system flock to join Darrow's cause. Darrow stages a televised battle against the Sovereign. His army falls in an Iron Rain from the sky onto Mars. Aided by a group of loyal Golds and Greys and Sevro's contact with the Sons of Ares, Darrow invades the capital fortress, but is thwarted when a Brown child acting as a decoy sets off an EMP blast. The EMP renders their armor useless and Darrow's forces are overwhelmed. Darrow manages to cut himself free of his suit and escape with Ragnar and Sevro. Angered, an injured Darrow rushes ahead of his allies and boards the Sovereign's ship. He attempts to assassinate her in a last ditch effort, managing to kill Karnus Au Bellona before being subdued by Aja Au Grimmus. Fitchner, also on the shuttle, is ordered to execute Darrow, but instead he escapes with Darrow and as Darrow loses consciousness reveals he is Ares. When Darrow awakes from a coma, he meets with Fitchner who reveals why he became Ares and started the revolution. Fitchner explains to Darrow that he fell in love with a Red and met with a Carver who made it possible for his wife to conceive a child with a Gold. She eventually gave birth to Sevro, but The Board of Quality Controls learns of their actions and \\"disposed of\\" Fitchner's wife. Angered, Fitchner vowed to bring down the Society and formed the Sons of Ares. Later, Darrow learns from Mustang that his efforts were not in vain. Roque and his fleet have defeated the Bellonas and the Sovereign, but Cassius and his mother escaped. The Augustus family has taken back Mars and Augustus plans to name Darrow his heir. Harmony has gone rogue, forming her own band of rebels against the Society. She is captured by the Jackal along with Mickey and other Sons. Darrow visits Victra and the Jackal, presenting them each with a gift. Before Adrius sees his, a squad of Sevro's men, in disguise, storm the Jackal's lair and free the prisoners from Adrius's grasp. Darrow, now weary of war, and realizing Mustang must know his secret if she is ever to fully trust him, returns home to Lykos. Mustang joins Darrow on his trip and he leads her to his home. He gives her a holotape (a recording of his \\"carving\\" into a Gold) and asks for her to watch the tape, and if she understands, to enter his home. After a heartfelt reunion with his mother, Darrow finds that Mustang has disappeared. He ultimately encounters her in a mining tunnel where Mustang angrily confronts him. She is prepared to kill him, but Ragnar intercedes, expressing his deep trust for Darrow and the freedom and purpose Darrow has given him, and Mustang leaves them kneeling in the dust. Darrow and his companions have a grand victory parade on Mars and Darrow is hailed as a hero. Later, a feast is held in his honor, Roque presents Darrow with a gift in an ivory box. As Roque passes the box to Darrow, he injects him with a tranquilizer and hisses that he is a traitor. Darrow, stunned by his friend's betrayal, realizes too late that the Sovereign has organized a coup. In the ensuing chaos, Lorn is murdered, Victra is shot in the back by her own sister Antonia, and the Jackal captures his father Nero. The Jackal explains to his father that he orchestrated this coup and to illustrate his willingness to do anything for power, confesses that he arranged the death of his older brother, Claudius, the more beloved of Nero's sons. As Nero angrily states he should have smothered the Jackal in his crib, the Jackal calmly shoots him. Cassius arrives, and the box Roque handed to Darrow is revealed to contain the head of Fitchner, stuffed with grapes, an echo of a long ago betrayal by Nero au Augustus of the Bellona family. Cassius tells Darrow that the Sovereign learned of his carving from the Jackal and wishes to dissect him to learn how he became a Gold. Cassius hisses that he will avenge his slain family members, and that the Sovereign and her forces will hunt down and kill all who have opposed her.

Mummagraphics, Inc., 469 F.3d 348 (4th Cir. 2006), is a case in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in which Mummagraphics, Inc. is sued by Omega World Travel, Inc. (Omega) and Cruise.com (a fully owned subsidiary of Omega) after Mummagraphic alleged that they received 11 commercial e-mail messages in violation of the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act of 2003 as well as Oklahoma state law. In the initial filing, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia had awarded summary judgment to Omega on all of Mummagraphics' claims finding that the commercial emails from Omega did not violate the CAN-SPAM Act, and that the CAN-SPAM Act preempted Oklahoma state law. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Parties The appellant (original plaintiff) was Mummagraphics, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation with its only place of operation in Oklahoma City. It provided web based services and hosted websites devoted to opposing spam messages. These websites included sueaspammer.com and OptOutByDomain.com. Its president was Mark Mumma. The appellees (original defendant) included Omega World Travel, Inc. and Cruise.com. Cruise.com was an operator of a website that sold cruise vacations. It sent email advertisements, also known as \\"E-deals,\\" to prospective customers. Background Cruise.com sent 11 e-mails containing travel offers to inbox@webguy.net, an email address operated by Mummagraphics. Each message contained a link on which the recipient could click in order to be removed from future mailings, and each message also stated that the recipient could opt-out of future e-mails by writing to a postal address provided in each e-mail address. Each message also contained a link to the Cruise.com website and a toll-free phone number for the company. Mummagraphics claimed that the Cruise.com e-mail messages contained several inaccuracies. First, each message stated that the recipient had signed up for the Cruise.com mailing list, but it had not asked that inbox@webguy.net receive the company's offers. Second, while each message listed Cruise.com as the sending organization, each also included the address \\"FL-Broadcast.net\\" (not a domain name linked to Cruise.com) in its header information. In addition, the messages' \\"from\\" field listed cruisedeals@cruise.com, an email address that Cruise.com had stopped using. Upon receiving the Cruise.com emails, Mumma did not use the opt-out link to remove the email address from the Cruise.com email list. Instead, Mumma called Omega's general counsel and complained that he had not asked to receive the email messages. He also refused to use email opt-out mechanisms, and instead threatened to sue for violations of Oklahoma law. Omega asked Mumma for the email address at which he was receiving the e-mail messages, but Mumma did not give it to them. Instead, he asked Omega to remove from all future mailings every address containing any of the domain names listed on Mummagraphics' OptOutByDomain.com website. Omega indicated that it would do so but later realized that removing all those addresses required considerable effort. So it did not immediately remove the addresses. A day later, Mummagraphics received another email message at inbox@webguy.net. It sent a letter to Omega stating that it had received multiple unsolicited email messages from Cruise.com. But again did not specify the email address at which the messages were being received. The letter claimed that the messages violated federal and state laws and said that Mummagraphics intended to sue for at least $150,000 in statutory damages unless they settled the matter for $6,250. It also attached the Cruise.com emails to his letter. For these email attachments, Omega was able to figure out the email address at which Mummagraphics was receiving the Cruise.com commercial emails and removed it from the Cruise.com mailing list. When Omega refused to pay the demanded settlement money, Mummagraphics accused Omega and Cruise.com of being \\"spammers\\" on its \\"anti-spam\\" websites. It also posted pictures of the Omega and Cruise.com executives, taken from their respective websites, on these \\"anti-spam\\" sites. On the basis of these postings, Omega and Cruise.com sued Mummagraphics claiming defamation, copyright infringement, trademark infringement, and unauthorized use of likeness. Mummagraphics raised counterclaims under CAN-SPAM Act and the Oklahoma law (these were the only claims that were pending in front of Fourth Circuit). It alleged that the Cruise.com e-mails contained actionable inaccuracies and that it failed to comply with opt-out provisions. The district court held that the CAN-SPAM Act preempted Mummagraphics' claims under Oklahoma's statutes. It further held that Cruise.com had not violated the CAN-SPAM Act because the email inaccuracies were not substantial and opt-out provisions were not violated. Mummagraphics appealed. Prior History The district court had awarded summary judgment to Omega on all of Mummagraphic's claims on the grounds that the CAN-SPAM Act preempted Mummagraphic's claims under Oklahoma's statutes. In addition, Mummagraphics had failed to allege material inaccuracies or pattern of failure to conform to opt-out requirements that is necessary to establish liability under the CAN-SPAM Act. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals = Mummagraphics' claims under Oklahoma state law = The Fourth Circuit upheld the district court holding that Oklahoma law could not cover these emails because the CAN-SPAM Act preempted state law with regard to immaterial misrepresentation. The court reasoned that the CAN-SPAM Act's exceptions only allow states to punish \\"falsity and deception,\\" and immaterial representation falls outside of the meaning of these terms. Thus, according to the court, the CAN-SPAM Act implicitly prevented states from punishing immaterial misrepresentations like the ones here. Mummagraphics argued that it was entitled to damages under the provisions of Oklahoma law which provide that \\"[i]t shall be unlawful for a person to initiate an electronic email message that the sender knows, or has reasons to know (1) misrepresents any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path of the electronic mail message; (2) does not contain information identifying the point of origin or the transmission path of the electronic mail message; or contains false, malicious or misleading information which purposefully or negligently injures a person.\\" The district court had held that the above provisions of the Oklahoma statute were preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act insofar as they applied to immaterial misrepresentations. And because the misrepresentations in this case were immaterial, Mummagraphics was not entitled to any damages under the Oklahoma statutory claims. Upon appeal, Mummagraphics argued that because the CAN-SPAM Act permits states to \\"prohibit[] falsity or deception\\" (under ), the district court was incorrect to hold that Oklahoma state law could not cover immaterial misrepresentations. The Fourth Circuit agreed with the district court finding that although by its terms Oklahoma state law was not limited to material misrepresentations, it was preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act in the case of immaterial misrepresentations. This was so because the CAN-SPAM exception allows states to punish only \\"falsity and deception\\" in commercial emails. The Court held that although the terms \\"falsity and deception\\" have not been defined in the CAN-SPAM Act, common meaning of these words indicates that the CAN-SPAM exception is applicable only to material misrepresentation. The court explained that \\"deception\\" requires more than bare error. While \\"falsity\\" may be defined as not being true it also conveys a sense of tortiuousness and wrongfulness. The word \\"falsity\\" when read in combination with \\"deception\\" indicates traditionally tortious or wrongful conduct. Thus, Congress would not have intended \\"falsity\\" to mean simply an error. Adopting such a meaning would also defeat the very purpose of the CAN-SPAM Act which is to ensure a careful balance between preserving a potentially useful commercial tool (electronic communication) and preventing its abuse. According to the court, Mummagraphics' reading of the \\"falsity or deception\\" exception would permit this exception to swallow the whole rule, giving states more power than intended and undermining the regulatory balance that Congress established. Accordingly, Mummagraphics' broad reading of the exception was not compatible with the structure of the CAN-SPAM Act as a whole. Thus, Mummagraphics' claims under Oklahoma state law failed. =Mummagraphics' claims under the CAN-SPAM Act= Mummagraphics argued that Cruise.com violated the CAN-SPAM Act by putting inaccurate header information in the commercial emails. The court noted that the CAN-SPAM Act provided at that \\"[i]t is unlawful for any person to initial the transmission, to a computer of a commercial electronic message . . . that contains, or is accompanied by, header information that is materially misleading.\\" The Act further explains that \\"materially\\" when used in connection with false or misleading header information, includes \\"alteration or concealment of header information in a manner that would impair the ability . . . to identify, locate, or respond to a person who initiated the electronic mail message or to investigate the alleged violation, or the ability of a recipient of the message to respond to a person who initiated the electronic message.\\" Mummagraphics alleged that the Cruise.com emails violated this provision of the CAN-SPAM Act because their emails' header incorrectly indicated that the emails were sent from \\"FL-Broadcast.net\\" and also because the emails' \\"from\\" address indicated an email address that was non-functional. The court rejected these claims, finding that the alleged misrepresentations were not \\"materially false or misleading\\" in view of the CAN-SPAM Act. The court noticed that the very purpose of the Cruise.com emails was to encourage the recipients to contact Cruise.com to book the cruises that the emails advertised. For this purpose, the Cruise.com emails, even though contained incorrect information in their headers, were otherwise full of ways to \\"identify, locate or respond to the sender\\" or to \\"investigate [an] alleges violation\\" of the CAN-SPAM Act. . For example, each email had a link to the Cruise.com website and a toll free contact number to call. Because the emails contained accurate identifiers about the sender, any inaccuracies in the header could not have impaired the efforts of any recipient, law enforcement organization, or other party raising a CAN-SPAM claim to find the company. The court also rejected Mummagraphics' claim for alleged violation of the CAN-SPAM Act's e-mail removal provisions. At , the Act requires that commercial emails include \\"a functioning return electronic mail address or other form of Internet-based mechanism . . . that a recipient may use to submit . . . internet based communication requesting not to receive future commercial electronic mail messages.\\" The Act also requires at that the senders of the commercial emails honor requests for removal made via these mechanisms within 10 business days. In addition, at the Act also permits internet access service providers to bring suit under these provisions for \\"a pattern or practice\\" that violates the requirements. The court held that Mummagraphics' sole allegation that the appellees failed to remove inbox@webguy.net from the ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤E-deals‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ mailing list within 10 days of Mark Mumma's call to Omega's general counsel did not satisfy the standard of \\"a pattern or practice.\\" Thus, Mummagraphics' claims under the CAN-SPAM Act failed too. =Mummagraphics' tort claims under the Oklahoma state law= With regards to the Mummagraphics' tort claim asserting that Cruise.com's emails amounted to trespass to chattels under the Oklahoma state law, the court held that the district court correctly granted summary judgment on this claim because Mummagraphics' had not offered evidence that the Cruise.com emails caused Mummagraphics more than nominal damages. The Court explained that trespass to chattel is a common tort that may be committed by intentionally (a) dispossessing another of the chattel, or (b) using or intermeddling with a chattel in possession of another. Such claims may be brought only when the trespasser (a) disposes the other of the chattel, (b) the chattel is impaired as to its condition, quality or value, (c) the processor is deprived of the use of the chattel for a substantial time, or (d) body harm is caused to the possessor, or harm is caused to some person or thing in which the possessor has a legally protected interest. The court noted that no Oklahoma court had earlier recognized trespass to chattels based upon intangible invasions of commuter resources. And the courts that have recognized such causes of action have not allowed \\"an action for nominal damages for harmless intermeddling with the chattel.\\" Here, Mummagraphics had failed to submit any evidence the receiving the 11 commercial emails from Cruise.com placed a meaningful burden on its computer system. Thus summary judgment was appropriate on this claim. = Policy considerations = Finally, commenting on the frustration and consternation that unsolicited commercial e-mails have created among the large number of internet users, the court stated that its role was not to determine the best way of regulating unsolicited commercial e-mails. Instead, its purpose was merely to implement the balance that the Congress sought to struck with the CAN-SPAM Act. Reactions After Omega World Travel, some commentators were concerned that the Fourth Circuit's interpretation of CAN-SPAM may frustrate consumers' self- help measures and further insulate spammers from prosecution. Some commented that the decision made \\"the very narrow and ineffective CAN SPAM law even more narrow and ineffective.\\" See also =General Information= * CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 * Federal preemption * Cyber law =Law Journal Articles= * Spam-a- lot: The states' crusade against unsolicited e-mail in light of the CAN-SPAM Act and the overbreadth doctrine * The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003: A False Hope * The Effectiveness of Litigation Under the CAN-SPAM Act.

He served in the Royal Navy during World War II and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross three times. Later, he was a businessman involved in shipbuilding and served as Chairman of British Shipbuilders from 1980 to 1984. Early life Atkinson was born on 7 March 1916 in Tynemouth, England. He was one of three sons born to Nicholas Ridley Atkinson, a civil engineer with the Tynemouth Improvement Commission, and his wife Margaret. He was educated at a grammar school, and then studied engineering at the University of London. His older brother was The Reverend Canon Professor James Atkinson, who was a Church of England priest and academic specialising in Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. His other brother died in March 1943 with the sinking of a merchant ship on which he was serving. It had been torpedoed and Robert was close enough to his brother's vessel to hear its distress signal over his ship's radio but not close enough to reach it before it sank. Military career Following the completion of his university degree, Atkinson joined the Royal Naval Reserve. He was promoted from acting sub-lieutenant to sub lieutenant on 13 August 1939. His first command was a requisitioned private yacht, , which he sailed from the United Kingdom to Gibraltar. From there, he was to conduct irregular operations in the Mediterranean Sea. One such operation was the seizure of an Italian tanker carrying aviation fuel, which he then sailed back to the UK. He later described the act, committed against a country that had yet to enter World War II, as 'pure act of piracy'. On 23 September 1940, he was promoted to lieutenant and granted seniority in that rank from 1 May 1940. He was awarded his first Distinguished Service Cross in 1941. He was the second-in-command of , a , and was involved in the dangerous duty of convoy escort. He took command of another Flower-class corvette, , in 1942 and escorted three crucial convoys, including ONS 5 in spring 1943. He was awarded his second DSC for his actions during this mission, which included a possible sinking of a U-boat. He received his third in 1945 for sinking German submarine U-878 in the . Atkinson was demobbed in 1946. Business career Following the war, Atkinson studied engineering at London University and McGill University, Montreal. Returning to the UK, he entered business and held managerial positions at William Doxford, Tube Investments, Unicorn Industries and Aurora Steel. In 1980, he was appointed Chairman of British Shipbuilders. He retired from that position in 1984. Personal life In 1941, Atkinson married Joyce Forster. Together they had two children; one son and one daughter. His first wife died in 1973. In 1977, he married Margaret Hazel Walker. They did not have any children. Atkinson died on 25 January 2015, at the age of 98. He was survived by his daughter and his second wife. Honours On 4 March 1941, Atkinson was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) 'for courage and skill in a successful action against an enemy submarine in heavy seas'. On 19 October 1943, he was awarded a bar to his Distinguished Service Cross (IE awarded the DSC for a second time) \\"For gallantry and devotion to duty in determined and successful attacks on U-boats while serving in H.M. Ships Duncan, Pink, Sunflower, Vidette, Tay, Loosestrife, Alisma, Spey, Pelican, Jed, Snowflake and Lagan on Convoy Escort duty\\". He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1983, and therefore granted the title sir.

Her research broadly studies how animal behavior evolved in mammals, with a specific focus on the social behavior, demography, and genetics of the yellow baboon, although some of her work has included the African elephant. She was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2014, won the Cozzarelli Prize of the National Academy of Sciences in 2016, and was elected a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences in 2019.  Education  Alberts received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology from Reed College in 1983, and went on to earn a Master of Arts in Biology from University of California, Los Angeles in 1987. She earned her Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolution at University of Chicago in 1992 for her work with her advisor, Jeanne Altmann. Her dissertation examined the maturation and dispersal of male baboons. She pursued postdoctoral research at the University of Chicago as an NIH Fellow, and was a Junior Fellow at Harvard University, and a Bunting Fellow at Radcliffe. She has been on the faculty at Duke since 1998.  Research  Alberts' research focuses on the interplay between environment, genetics, and behavior. She has published over 100 peer- reviewed articles in the fields of anthropology, genetics, endocrinology, biology, and primatology. Early in her career, her research focused largely on the behavior of male baboons through dispersal, mate guarding, social rank within the group, while later in her research career, she expanded her inquiry to include life history, epigenetics, endocrinology, and mating systems of both sexes. Notably, her work has found links between longevity and social relationships within baboon groups, with cohesive group-living having benefits for surviving environmental stresses. Her most recent work focuses on the social dimensions of aging and how early-life adversity affects behavior, body size and immune function Alberts has also served as an editor for numerous peer-reviewed journals in a variety of fields, including Behavioral Ecology (journal), the American Journal of Primatology, and PeerJ.

It is an understory tree in karri forest but also occurs as a stunted shrub in places like Bluff Knoll in the Stirling Range. Description Karri oak usually grows as a medium tree high, although in harsh, exposed situations in places like the top of Bluff Knoll it is a stunted shrub or poorly-formed tree in shrubland. As with other members of the family Casuarinaceae, the foliage consists of wiry green branchlets called cladodes with rings of minute leaf scales. In this species, the branchlets are about long, roughly square or X-shaped in cross section, with four scale-teeth in each ring. The rings of scale-leaves are apart. Separate male and female flowers form on the same individual plant. The fruiting structure is a woody cone, shaped like a short cylinder with its diameter roughly equal to or slightly greater than its length. The fruit is a winged samara long. It often grows in association with Acacia pentadenia and Asplenium aethiopicum often grows as an epiphyte on its branches. Taxonomy This species was first formally described in 1873 by George Bentham Flora Australiensis from specimens collected by James Drummond near Cape Riche, Western Australia. Bentham gave it the name Casuarina decussata. In 1982, Lawrie Johnson moved it to its current genus Allocasuarina in his revision of the she-oaks. It is closely related to A. torulosa of New South Wales and Queensland. Bark of a young A. decussata in the Walpole-Nornalup National Park. The specific epithet (decussata) is a Latin word meaning \\"like the letter X\\" or \\"the Roman numeral ten\\". Distribution and habitat Karri oak is restricted to the southwest of Western Australia in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographical regions. It grows on loam in the karri forest but also found on much poorer soils in the Stirling Range. Cultivation and uses Karri oak is not known in cultivation and there is only limited availability of timber because most trees are in national parks but its pale reddish-brown heartwood has distinctive rays that potentially make it useful as a craft wood.

Without pasteurization or high-pressure processing (HPP), cold-pressed juices can be stored in a refrigerator for up to three days when phytochemical and micronutrient degradation occurs. Some juicers use technology that helps delay oxidation which can allow for slightly longer storage in refrigerators. This type of juice has been commercially produced for decades, but became more common in some countries since 2013. In general, these juices are more expensive than other types of juices, as they are made from 100% fruit and vegetables without any added ingredients. It has been reported that a 12-ounce bottle could cost as much as US$12. History Although cold-pressed juices were produced over several decades, the products gained more common use during the fad of juice \\"cleansing\\", expanding into a wider industry in the early 21st century. Manufacturing process Making cold-pressed juice is a two-step process. The first stage is to shred or compress the fruits or vegetables into a pulp. In industrial production, the shredding process uses a steel rotating disc. Produce is loaded into a large hopper feeding tube and typically falls into a filter bag. The second process is the hydraulic press; this exposes the shredded produce to extreme pressures between two plates. The pressure causes the juice and water content from the produce to drip into a collection tray below, leaving behind the fibre content in the filter bag. The pomace left behind is generally composted, recycled in food products or discarded. The industry standard hydraulic cold-press technology with vertical pressing layers was invented by Dale E. Wettlaufer in 1983. Vertical press layers with open-top cloth bags allow for faster loading and emptying of the press, compared to the classic rack-and-cloth method which involved wrapping layers of ground fruit in cloth. After extracting juice from fruits and vegetables, the juice may be consumed raw, or the manufacturer may choose to put the juice through a preservation method such as HPP or pasteurization in order to extend shelf life and kill potentially harmful microorganisms. Pasteurization or HPP allows the juice to be stored for about 30 days. Without pasteurization, as for typical home-made juices stored in a refrigerator, significant degradation of phytochemicals and micronutrients occurs within 6 days. Industry Starting with Liquiteria in 1996, cold- pressed juice bars first emerged in New York City and have since spread internationally. Though the size of the cold-pressed juice industry is not independently tracked, the 2013 estimates ranged from US$1.6 billion to US$3.4 billion. Nutrient preservation Cold-pressing does not preserve phytochemicals or micronutrients better than conventional centrifugal juicing or blending. Color and physicochemical composition, including polyphenols, carotenoids, vitamin C, and antioxidant capacity, were not different among juices of various tropical fruits prepared using a cold-press instrument, a centrifugal juicer or a blender. Cold-pressed juices showed degradation of constituents within 6 days of normal cold storage in a refrigerator. High cost Cold-pressed juices could cost US$10 for a 16-ounce bottle, and as high as US$12 for a 12-ounce bottle. The high cost has been attributed to the manufacturing process which uses an HPP machine that may cost from US$800,000 to over US$2 million. Alternatively, the incremental cost of tool processing could range from US$0.25‚ÄìUS$0.45 per bottle, not including transport. Counter- top juicers produced for home-use can be purchased for anywhere between $100-$2000 dollars; there are single-gear mastication juicers at lower price points and there are hydraulic press juicers at higher price points.  Laws and regulations  There are laws and regulations governing the production and distribution of raw juice that vary widely by region. In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration prohibits wholesale distribution of raw juice, stating that it may only be sold directly to consumers. In order to sell juice wholesale, the juice must undergo a process that achieves a \\"5 log reduction in bacterial plate count.\\" The process must reduce the amount of microorganisms by 100,000 times. There are several processes available that can achieve a 5-log reduction, including heat pasteurization and ultraviolet light filtering, but the most common process in the cold-pressed juice industry is HPP. Juice manufacturers may also have to organize an approved HACCP (Hazard Analyses Critical Control Points) plan. In a HACCP plan, the manufacturer must identify at which points in the manufacturing process the juice may become contaminated, and how to regularly test and confirm that the juice is not being contaminated. The manufacturer must keep log books available for health inspectors if requested. Nutritional labeling requirements must be followed in some regions, including the US, where the nutrition facts label must state nutritional content, ingredients and the manufacturer.

He was one of the leaders of the Tripoli Jewish community for some 50 years. Early life and family Nathan Adadi was born in Palestine. Little is known about his early life. He served as a shadar and was dispatched to the Jewish community in Livorno, Italy, to collect funds for the Jews of Palestine. Afterwards he traveled to Tripoli, where he became a prominent student of Mas'ud Hai Rakkah, one of the leading rabbis of Libyan Jewry in the 18th century. Rakka·∏• chose Adadi as a son-in- law, and Adadi and his wife had one son, Mas'ud Hai Adadi. Together with Hakhamim Shalom Plus and Moshe Lachmish, Adadi led the Tripoli Jewish community after Rakka·∏•'s death in 1768. Among Adadi's students was Rabbi Yehuda Lavie, a leading rabbi and kabbalist in Tripoli in the 19th century. In 1802 Adadi was appointed to the Tripoli beit din (rabbinical court), but served only for a few days. According to his grandson, Abraham Hayyim Adadi, he \\"resigned voluntarily because he was a zealot, favoring no man, however rich or prominent\\". Later years and death Adadi's son and daughter-in-law died at a young age, leaving one young son, Abraham Hayyim Adadi (1801-1874). Adadi took the boy into his care and was his primary Torah teacher. In 1818, Adadi decided to return to Palestine, and his 18-year-old grandson accompanied him. Later that same year, Adadi died in Safed. Works Adadi authored numerous works on the Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah, and Mishnah, including the sefarim Me'orei Natan and Chok Natan, but his writings were not published and were subsequently lost. Adadi began preparing for publication the second volume of his father-in-law's major work, Ma'aseh Rokea·∏•, a commentary on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, from handwritten manuscripts, but did not complete the task.

This is how the company illustrates its marketing idea of the synthesis of the natural and the technical. An important highlight of the store interior is a wall of changeable color which should serve as a background for mannequins wearing brand's new collection items, as well as LED lighting. These details is intended to help communicating Audimas new season's updates to shopping centre visitors before they actually enter the store. The interior of the central store area (or the \\"home\\" area) illustrates the home interior. The sales equipment should remind the customer a large closet. The central displays of the sales floor is installed using home-like elements, carpets, armchairs, picture frames and shelves. Such composition is supplemented with natural looking mannequins. The \\"action\\" area of the new concept Audimas retail store includes items that should stimulate customers desire to travel. Each store is equipped with a different item stimulating visitors this kind of desire. That is another marketing way Audimas chooses to attract visitors to its products and increase retail sales.

Biography He was educated by the painters Carl Joseph Begas in Berlin and L√©on Cogniet in Paris (1845). After this he spent a couple of years in Rome. His paintings are characterized by humour and a poetic atmosphere. Wilhelm Amberg has won many awards and from 1886 was a Member of the Senate of the Prussian Academy of Arts, Berlin. Works Werther, 1870 The painting depicting A reading from the novel The Sorrows of Young Werther shows five young girls seated in a romantic spot in the nature, who went outdoors to read from this novel. One of them is crying, leaning on the other girl's shoulders. The other one is leaning towards the girl reading, with intense attentiveness, also having a handkerchief in her hand, the same as the girl sitting beside the reader. She also has one, that is beside her placed on the vegetation overgrown with moss she sits on ... all the young girls are moved by the lecture. Soon after its publication in 1774, young women were impressed by the novel and young men began to dress in yellow pants and blue jackets, like young Werther, the main character in the novel. Werther shoots himself with a pistol after he is rejected by the woman he loves, and shortly after its publication there were many reports of young men using the same method to kill themselves in an act of hopelessness.

Canadian Journal of Zoology 45: 1215-1224 . T. commodus belongs to the order Orthoptera, the family Gryllidae which are characterized by wings that are folded on the side of the body, chewing mouthparts and long, thin antennae. T. commodus has the ability to learn via the recognition of rewards. In addition, they are also capable of odour recognition and thus can be taught via odour pairing.Anderson C, Kasumovic M. 2017. Development rate rather than social environment influences cognitive performance in Australian black field crickets, Teleogryllus commodus. PeerJ 5: 1-15.  Morphology  T. commodus can grow up to 30 mm long, with long antennas and legs adapted for jumping.Kimber B, McDonald G. 2015 . Black Field Crickets Teleogryllus commodus. Pest Notes Southern 1: 1-5. Their coloration is usually black or brown. Nymphs can be recognized by a white stripe on the abdomen. Adult females are characterized by ovipositors which are long structures used for laying eggs. In contrast, males have modified veins in forewings with hard pegs that play a role in song production.Montealegre-Z F, Jonsson T, and Robert D. 2011. Sound radiation and wing mechanics in stridulating field crickets. The Journal of Experimental Biology 214: 2105-2117. Another fact about black field crickets is that their tegmina (leathery forewing) is asymmetrical. T. commodus undergo hemimetabolous (the lack of pupal stage from larva to adult) development with 3 main stages: egg, nymph (multiple stages~8), and adulthood Females age faster than males do.Hunt J, Jennions M.D.,Spyrou N, and Brooks R. 2006. Artificial Selection on Male Longevity Influences Age‚ÄêDependent Reproductive Effort in the Black Field Cricket T. Commodus. The American Naturalist 168:72-86 .Zajitschek F, Lailvaux S.P., Dessmann J, and Brooks R. Diet, sex, and death in field crickets. Ecology and Evolution 2:1627-1632 . Furthermore, virgin males have a shorter life expectancy than mated males, most likely due to high calling efforts in attracting mates. However, high quality males may still die sooner if they call very intensely.  Habitat  T. commodus can be located throughout Australia and New Zealand. The species originated in Australia but with time they were introduced to New Zealand. They are known to cause significant damage to pastures and gardens. The habitat of T. commodus consists of rocky surfaces or ground with large amounts of cracks as it gives them shelter from the sun, and is most active at night. Moreover, T. commodus live in clusters and thus seek living quarters that are already occupied by others.Evans A.R. 2016. A study of the behaviour of the Australian field cricket T. commodus (Walker) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) in the field and in habitat simulations. Zeitschrift f√ºr Tierpsychologie 62: 269-290 . The adult males usually change burrows every two days as a consequence of scarce mates or frequent attacks from other males.  Diet  T. commodus are omnivores so their diet is rather broad but they mostly feed on plants, so far no preference for any particular plants has been established. Reproductive differences between male and females result in differing dietary requirements. Females require a diet with higher protein content for the production of eggs, whereas males require an energy rich diet for call production.  Reproduction  Males attract females to burrows through production of advertisement calls, wherein females will mount the males should they be interested - therefore, song production is a key determinant for fitness of the male.Bentsen C.L., Hunt J, Jennions M.D., Brooks R. 2006. Complex Multivariate Sexual Selection on Male Acoustic Signaling in a Wild Population of Teleogryllus commodus. The American Naturalist 167:102-116.Shackleton M.A., Jennions M.D., Hunt J. 2005. Fighting Success and Attractiveness as Predictors of Male Mating Success in the Black Field Cricket, T. commodus. Behavior Ecology 58:1-8 . Once a female have chosen a mate, they undergo multiple matings to increases the males‚Äô probability of paternity. Successful mating leads to oogenesis (production of egg), ovulation (release of egg into oviduct), fertilization, and oviposition (deposition of eggs using ovipositor).Larson E.L., Andres J.A., Harrison R.G. 2012. Influence of the Male Ejaculate on Post-Mating Prezygotic Barriers in Field Crickets. PLOS One 7: 1-10 . Once the eggs are laid they need to absorb water required for development.Browning T.O. 1965. Observations on the Absorption of Water, Diapause and Embryogenesis in the Eggs of the Cricket T. commodus. J. Exp. Biol 43:433-439 . The duration of water absorption is dependent on the temperature of the environment; in higher temperatures, faster water absorption is required. By absorbing water, the size of the egg shell increases thereby increasing the odds of the progeny hatching.  Song production  Male black field crickets produce mating calls using their forewings. Rubbing of wings produces pure tones, while rapid oscillations produce acoustic radiation. The greatest degree of sounds are generated upon wing closure. The general pattern of advertisement calls start with single chirp then move to pulsation with high repetition. The duration of calls is an aspect females seek as an indication of genetic superiority. In addition, females show a preference for males that produce a large number of repeats during calling. As such, males spend as long as half a night calling. Prolonged calling, however, comes with a price by shortening of the male lifespan because of the associated high energy expenditure. Calling is also an indicator of male age, as the expression of signaling changes with age. Females showed a preference for males that produce large number of repeats during calling.  Fight behaviour  T. commodus fighting behavior resembles that of hermit crabs and gammarids.Reaney L.T., Drayton J.M., Jennions M.D. 2010. The role of body size and fighting experience in predicting contest behaviour in the black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 65:217-225 . Their stereotypical fighting sequence starts with antennal contact and mandible flaring. If neither male concedes from the aggressive display, violent wrestling and biting proceeds. The winner of the fight often exhibits acoustic display. The antennal contact is a way for males to communicate their strength. Naive males are just as likely as larger males to win a non-physical opponent.  Predators  Natural predators of T. commodus include bats and ground beetles.Giachino P.M. 2005. Results of the Zoological Missions to Australia of the Regional Museum of Natural Science of Turin, Italy. Monographs Museo Regionale di Scienze Naturali Torino 42: 239-268 .Kibedi J. 2016. An Investigation on the Ecological Significance of the Terrestrial Context in Predator-Prey Interactions between Echolocating Bats and the Australian Field Cricket. School of Biomedical Science 1-207. The key to crickets' survival when targeted by predators is detection. T. commodus mostly rely on their hearing when avoiding predators, which is affected by their surroundings. Inbreeding avoidance Male T. commodus use advertisement calling to attract mates. Inbred males call less often than out- bred males. Female T. commodus prefer males with a more frequent calling effort, so that inbred males suffer reductions in mating success. Male calling rate likely serves as an indicator to females of genome-wide heterozygosity and/or male condition.

It was designed by Joseph Monier and built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 August 1998.  History  The Monier Ventilation Shafts are thought to have been constructed , as part of a system of ventilation shafts (either concrete or steel/iron) located at intervals along some of Brisbane's inner city arterial stormwater drains. Three concrete shafts survive (of at least five erected) and may be the first pre-cast reinforced concrete structures in Queensland. The Wickham Terrace shaft, on the footpath at the eastern end of Albert Park, opposite Twine Street, was one of a pair, the other having been erected just inside the park, opposite Lilley Street, but since removed. A concrete shaft of identical dimensions exists on the footpath of St Paul's Terrace, opposite Gloucester Street. Both the Wickham Terrace and St Paul's Terrace shafts appear to have been associated with the first Spring Hill stormwater drainage system, laid in the 1880s. A third shaft, of similar but smaller dimensions, exists on the footpath near the former Queensland Primary Producers' Woolstore No.8, in Florence Street, Teneriffe. Stormwater drains were laid in Florence and Ethel streets in mid-1904, and the concrete ventilation shaft at the east end of the Florence Street drain may have been constructed shortly afterwards. In the 19th century, the distinction between drainage and sewerage was not well defined. Drains were described as sewers and they received a combination of sullage, roof and surface run-off. They relied on rainwater for flushing, and discharged to the nearest watercourse. When Brisbane acquired municipal status in late 1859, there was no system of drainage or sewerage in the town. Most people dumped refuse in the creeks and channels, trusting that stormwater would carry it away to the river, and for some years the Municipal Council considered drainage and sewerage as one and the same thing. However, from about 1868 the Council adopted the policy of \\"rainfall to the river\\" and \\"sewerage to the land\\", developing a city drainage scheme to carry off stormwater and an earth closet sanitary service. The Brisbane Drainage Act of 1875, under which the colonial government agreed to set aside crown land for sale to finance Brisbane's drainage scheme, provided the impetus for construction of Brisbane's early arterial stormwater drains. The systems were designed by the colonial government's Engineer for Harbours and Rivers, William David Nisbet, and carried out by government contractors under government supervision. Upon completion they became the property and responsibility of the Brisbane Municipal Council, which was responsible also for laying branch drains. By 1878, the inner city was drained by three separate systems: * the Frog's Hollow system - a main drain down Albert and Margaret Streets with branches laid by the Brisbane Municipal Council * the Adelaide-Creek Street system, which drained the centre of the town from Makerston Street to Queen Street and the lower sections of Elizabeth and Charlotte Street * the Makerston Street system, which served the area between Makerston Street and Petrie Terrace, and between Wickham Terrace and College Road and the Brisbane River. Between 1879 and 1886 the Brisbane Municipal Council, with government loans, developed an arterial drainage system for the densely populated suburbs of Spring Hill and Fortitude Valley (even though the Valley lay outside the Brisbane town boundary). Much of this work comprised open drains, which were covered in the late 1890s. South Brisbane and Kangaroo Point drainage systems were constructed in 1885-86. In the late 1880s, the Brisbane Municipal Council drained parts of New Farm, and a drainage system for Petrie Terrace, begun in 1883, was completed in the late 1880s. By 1890, the Brisbane Municipal Council had completed an arterial drainage scheme for the city core, at a total cost of nearly . The densely populated Booroodabin Division was annexed to the Municipality of Brisbane in 1903, and in 1908 a loan was secured to enable the Council to complete the drainage of Merthyr, New Farm, Teneriffe, Bowen Hills, Mayne and Newstead by the end of 1909. Without a proper sewerage system, Brisbane residents still tended to dispose of household and trade waste into the stormwater drainage systems. This led to the chronic pollution of local creeks, and foul smells emanating from the stormwater drains. Prior to bacterial theory being widely accepted, such miasma was thought to cause disease. The situation was compounded in 1900 with the arrival of bubonic plague in Australia, carried by rats aboard ships arriving from foreign ports. The first case of human plague in Sydney was reported in January 1900, and in Brisbane (a day and a half away by steamer) on 27 April 1900. Between 1900 and 1909, plague broke out in most of Queensland's ports, galvanising the State into developing tighter controls over public health and sanitation. In the early 20th century, the Commissioner of Public Health, using the strong coercive powers given to him under the provisions of the Health Act of 1900, required the Brisbane Municipal Council to erect ventilators in city streets to remove foul and unhealthy smells from the drainage systems. In 1900, the Council called tenders for the construction and erection of a ventilating shaft at Thorn Street, Kangaroo Point. No trace remains of this vent, except for its design, which was in the Monier system of re-inforced concrete, and identical with that of the vents that have survived on Wickham Terrace and St Paul's Terrace. The Monier system of reinforced concrete (invented by Frenchman Joseph Monier and patented in 1867) was introduced to Australia in the early 1890s by WJ Baltzer, a New South Wales engineer. Monier's was the first true reinforced concrete, based on calculations which ensured that the steel was dispersed so as to take tension and shear forces. Baltzer, in association with contracting engineers Carter Gummow and Co. of Sydney, gained the Australian rights to this innovative fabric. The company constructed the first Monier system structure (a small arch for a storm water culvert) in Burwood, New South Wales, in 1894 and a sewer aqueduct linking the Sydney suburbs of Annandale and Balmain in 1895. The first use of the Monier system in Victoria was in 1897 with the Anderson Street Bridge over the Yarra River, designed and constructed by Carter Gummow & Co. Carter Gummow and Co. began manufacture of Monier pipes in Sydney in 1897, and John Monash's Reinforced Concrete & Monier Pipe Construction Co. commenced production in Melbourne in 1903. During the financial year 1903-04, the Brisbane Municipal Council authorised the spending of on erecting sewer [drain] ventilating shafts wherever they were urgently needed. It is thought that the surviving concrete ventilation shafts were constructed in consequence.  Description  The three surviving concrete ventilation shafts are located in Brisbane's inner city suburbs of Spring Hill and Teneriffe. Two are in Spring Hill - one at the eastern end of Albert Park, on the footpath on Wickham Terrace opposite Twine Street; another on the footpath on St Paul's Terrace, opposite Gloucester Street. A third is located on the footpath in Florence Street, Teneriffe, west of the intersection with Macquarie Street. They ventilate stormwater drains rather than sewers. The Spring Hill ventilators are located on ridges, but the Teneriffe ventilator is on low ground near the Brisbane River. It is not known what rationale was adopted in deciding where the vents were to be placed. The ventilators are constructed of reinforced concrete, hexagonal in shape, with simple ornamentation at half height and apex. The Spring Hill ventilators are tall with a base width of . They have a wall thickness of at the base, tapering to at the top. The Teneriffe ventilator is of slightly smaller dimensions. All three ventilators are thought to have been constructed in accordance with the patented Monier ventilation system for venting public sewers and drains, and probably pre-cast in an hexagonal mould, with the top face open.  Heritage listing  Monier Ventilation Shaft 2 was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 August 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Monier Ventilation Shafts, constructed , are important in illustrating late 19th/early 20th century attitudes toward public health and sanitation, and survive as visible evidence of Brisbane's early and extensive stormwater drainage scheme and venting system. The three surviving concrete shafts are thought to be the first pre-cast reinforced concrete structures in Queensland, and examples of the earliest application of the Monier system of reinforced concrete construction in Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. They provide rare surviving evidence of this early use of true reinforced concrete, and are significant as indicators of the technically advanced state of municipal engineering and construction in Brisbane at the turn of the 20th century. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. They have the potential to contribute further to our understanding of: * community attitudes toward public health in the late 19th/early 20th centuries * Brisbane's early stormwater drainage scheme * early pre-cast reinforced concrete technology in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. They remain highly intact examples of their type and demonstrate engineering skill and involvement in creating aesthetically pleasing but functional structures.

She has a backpack, with a sniper rifle strapped to her side, and is standing beside a man in his 40's, who has brown hair and beard, and a revolver in his right hand. The Last of Us, a 2013 action-adventure survival horror video game developed by Naughty Dog, deals with the relationship between an older man, Joel, and a teenaged girl, Ellie. Joel is tasked with escorting Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States in an attempt to create a potential cure against an infection to which Ellie is immune. The relationship between the two characters became the basis of the game's development. Joel is the primary playable character of the game, though players assume control of Ellie for a short portion. Throughout their journey, Joel and Ellie meet various characters: Tess, a survivor who is closely acquainted with Joel, Marlene, leader of the militia group the Fireflies; Bill, a survivor who fortified his own town; Henry and Sam, brothers from Hartford; Joel's brother Tommy and his wife Maria who have built their own settlement; and David, the leader of a group of cannibals. In addition, Joel's daughter Sarah appears in the game's prologue, and Ellie's friend Riley Abel is featured in the downloadable content pack The Last of Us: Left Behind. A team at Naughty Dog designed the character appearances, and creative director Neil Druckmann was the main writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, simultaneously performing the motion capture work for their characters. Various characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming completely different from the initial vision. The relationship of the characters received praise from several gaming publications, and the acting has resulted in multiple awards, including two BAFTAs and a DICE Award. Creation and conception alt=A 35-year-old man with curly black hair talking into a microphone, looking at something to the left of the camera. The relationship between the characters of Joel and Ellie, portrayed by Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, respectively, was the central focus of the game's development. Creative director Neil Druckmann wrote the game's script, particularly focusing on the characters. Though the development team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realized that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly to the development of the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (2009), in turn inspired by the video game Ico (2001). The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills. The character's performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded later in a studio. The development team felt that the post-apocalyptic world and the survival horror genre gave them the opportunity to better develop the characters. Taking inspiration from their work on the Uncharted games, the team used their knowledge of paralleling characters with the conflict in both gameplay and stories when developing The Last of Us. They also took inspiration from the books The Road (2006) and City of Thieves (2008), and the film No Country for Old Men (2007), noting that they all include memorable characters and using this as a point of inspiration. \\"[W]e can make you as a player feel more of what it's truly like to exist inside of a world where every bullet counts and each step you take is a conscious choice that's going to make or break your existence,\\" said Straley. The team also felt that the \\"pressures of the world\\" allowed them to better develop their characters. They felt that the pressure forced the characters to make interesting decisions, allowing better development. Lead characters =Joel= alt=A 34-year-old man with spiky blonde hair, smiling at something to the left of the camera. Joel Miller (Troy Baker) is the protagonist of The Last of Us. Originally from Texas, Joel was a single father in his late 20s when the initial Cordyceps outbreak occurred. Fleeing with his brother Tommy and his twelve-year-old daughter Sarah, they got involved in a firefight with a soldier, and Sarah was mortally wounded and died in his arms, leaving him traumatized. In the 20 years that follow, Joel did whatever he had to do to survive. Twenty years after Sarah's death, Joel works as a smuggler in the Boston quarantine zone with his friend and partner Tess. While out searching for a former accomplice who stole some of their merchandise, Joel and Tess are tasked by Marlene, an acquaintance and leader of a rebel militia called the Fireflies, to smuggle Ellie to a rendezvous point. Joel discovers that Ellie is immune to the infection. Upon their arrival, Tess reveals that she has sustained a bite on the journey, and insists Joel finds Tommy, a former Firefly, in order to continue the mission. Joel is initially surly and short towards Ellie, though he begins to warm up to her as their journey continues. This is compounded when Joel, having initially asked Tommy to carry on in his place after meeting up with him, changes his mind and carries on as planned. Their bond deepens when Ellie nearly loses Joel to a severe injury, and when he comes to her aid after she is nearly killed by a band of cannibals. Ultimately, Joel shows his devotion to Ellie when he chooses to rescue her from the doctors who plan to remove and examine her brain, as opposed to allowing her to die. To ensure they are not pursued, Joel kills Marlene. Driving away, Ellie wakes up, after which Joel tells her the doctors gave up on discovering a cure. Ellie later confronts him about the events, and Joel swears to her that he was telling the truth. When designing Joel's physical appearance, the team tried to make him look \\"flexible enough\\" to allow for him to appear as both a \\"ruthless operator in the underground of a quarantined city\\" as well as a \\"caring father figure to Ellie\\". When writing the character of Joel, Druckmann initially took inspiration from Josh Brolin's portrayal of Llewelyn Moss in No Country for Old Men (2007), which he saw as \\"very quiet, very cool under pressure\\". However, Baker's interpretation of Joel as a more emotional person evolved the character in a different way. Druckmann felt that players, specifically parents, would be able to relate to Joel's character and his bonding with Ellie. Druckmann became intrigued by players who discussed Joel's morality, distinguishing him as a hero or villain; Druckmann felt that Joel was only \\"a complex person who's made good and bad decisions\\", but allowed it to be open to interpretation. When auditioning for the role, Baker read a phrase on the character sheet that stated Joel had \\"few moral lines left to cross\\", which became the \\"anchor point\\" to the character for him. Baker returned to portray Joel in The Last of Us Part II (2020). =Ellie= alt=A 30-year-old woman with long, blonde hair, smiling at someone to the right of the camera. Ellie (Ashley Johnson) is a fourteen-year-old orphan and the other main playable character in the game, and one of the few characters to have never known life before the infection. Much of her backstory is revealed in the additional content The Last of Us: Left Behind and the comic book miniseries The Last of Us: American Dreams. After surviving a bite from the Infected, Ellie is tasked to Joel to be escorted to the Fireflies. Initially annoyed by Joel's surliness, Ellie starts to feel a strong attachment to him. After experiencing a traumatizing encounter in the Winter, in which Ellie is nearly raped and murdered by a band of cannibals, she becomes withdrawn and introverted. When Joel finally gets her to the Fireflies, it is discovered that she has a mutant strain of the Cordyceps fungus growing on her brain, which may be used to create a vaccine; in order to extract the fungi, an operation on Ellie's brain is required, that will likely kill her. While she is being prepared for surgery, Joel makes his way to the operating room and carries her to safety. When Ellie awakens from unconsciousness, Joel lies by telling her that the Fireflies found many other subjects, and had stopped looking for a cure. Ellie later confronts him about it, demanding to know the truth. When he reassures her that he is telling the truth, she replies with \\"Okay\\". The team felt that the establishing of the physical appearance of Ellie was \\"critical\\"; they felt that she needed to appear young enough to make her relationship with Joel believable, but old enough to be credible as a resourceful teenager capable of surviving. When questioned about the inspiration for Ellie as a gameplay feature, Druckmann recalled when he and Straley were brainstorming ideas for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and created a mute character who would summon the player to follow them, creating a \\"beautiful\\" relationship through gameplay alone. Though this concept was never included in the final game, the idea was raised when the team were discussing a new project, ultimately inspiring Ellie. Following the release of Left Behind, in which Ellie is seen kissing her friend Riley, Druckmann has confirmed that she is gay. Johnson returned to play Ellie in The Last of Us Part II. Secondary characters =Tommy= Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) is Joel's brother. At the initial outbreak, he picked Joel and Sarah up in his car to take them to safety. When the car is hit by a truck, he defends Joel as he carries Sarah, whose leg is badly hurt. After Sarah's death, Joel and Tommy initially survive together, but differing outlooks and Joel's hardened ways led to their estrangement, and Tommy left to join the Fireflies. After becoming disillusioned, he subsequently left them as well, and built a settlement around a working power plant in Wyoming with his wife, Maria. Many years later, Joel arrives at Tommy's settlement, and the brothers are reunited. Tommy initially refuses to take Ellie off Joel's hands, but upon seeing their close bond and realizing that Joel doesn't trust himself to protect Ellie, he agrees to take her to Marlene himself. However, Ellie confronts Joel about Sarah and, after having a change of heart, Joel and Ellie continue their journey after Tommy promises them sanctuary should they need it. The development team aimed for Tommy's physical appearance to resemble Joel \\"in stature and rugged toughness\\", but also to express his compassionate approach to the world. While Tommy shares Joel's \\"gritty masculinity\\", he also has a gentleness which Joel lacks. Pierce originally auditioned for the role of Joel, which was later given to Troy Baker. When the team was required to cast an actor for the role of Tommy, they immediately contacted Pierce, as they were impressed by his audition. Baker felt that the chemistry between him and Pierce assisted in the realistic relationship between Joel and Tommy. Pierce reprised the role of Tommy in The Last of Us Part II. =Marlene= Marlene (Merle Dandridge) is the leader of the Fireflies, a militia movement hoping to wrest control of the Quarantine Zones from the military. She was tasked by Ellie's mother, a close friend of hers, to look out for her daughter, but Ellie only met her after her infection. After being wounded in Boston, she offers to sell Joel and Tess the merchandise Robert stole from them and sold to her in return for smuggling Ellie out of the Quarantine Zone. Joel meets Marlene again at the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City, where scientists are running tests on Ellie. Marlene reveals that they will operate on Ellie, which will result in her death; Joel disagrees with the operation and fights back. After Joel rescues Ellie, Marlene tries to stop him from leaving, insisting that taking Ellie will merely delay her death until a more gruesome one occurs, and Ellie's return to her would help to create a cure against the infection. Joel disregards her and instead shoots her in the stomach. She begs for her life, but Joel executes her with a shot to the head, ensuring that no-one is left to come after them. The team aimed for Marlene's physical design to make her look \\"capable and in control\\", while conveying compassion, to result in players believing that she does care for Ellie. Dandridge found the character of Marlene to be complex, believing that she \\"wants to do the best thing for the greater good\\", but events in her life have resulted in a confused moral standing. Though she personally believed that Marlene is a fundamentally \\"good\\" person, Dandridge felt that the ambiguous morality of the characters is a significant contributor to the interest in their humanity. Dandridge also appreciated the use of motion capture, comparing it to theater productions. =Tess= alt=A 31-year-old woman with long, brown hair, smiling with her head tilted at someone holding a microphone to the left of the camera. Tess (Annie Wersching) is Joel's smuggling partner and friend. After chasing down and killing Robert, a former accomplice who stole their merchandise, Tess and Joel are offered their merchandise back from Robert's buyer Marlene if they agree to help smuggle Ellie to the State Capitol building outside of the Quarantine Zone with Joel. She and Joel successfully make it to the Capitol building, only to discover upon arrival that the people they are meant to rendezvous with are all dead. When Joel protests that they must return, Tess insists that she cannot go any further and reveals she was bitten on the journey. As soldiers arrive at the building, Tess orders Joel, as a last obligation to her, to find Tommy and get Ellie to the Fireflies, before sending them off while she covers them. Tess is then killed in the subsequent gunfight, ensuring she never turns. When designing the physical appearance of Tess, the team aimed to make her look \\"tough and capable\\", striving to add an element of strength in order to show that she might be more ruthless than Joel. Tess was originally intended to be featured as the main antagonist of The Last of Us, pursuing Joel for a year before a final confrontation in which she is killed by Ellie. However, the team found it difficult to believe that Tess would dispute with Joel and pursue him for a year; this was solved by majorly altering the story. Wersching was impressed by the script, and Druckmann's ability to write unique female characters. When writing the game's female characters, particularly Tess and Ellie, Druckmann avoided external influences, such as the media's portrayal of women, as he wished to write his own story. =Bill= Bill (W. Earl Brown) is a survivor and business partner of Joel and Tess who lives in Lincoln near Boston. A paranoid, aggressive, and distrustful man in his late 40s, Bill lives alone in a heavily fortified town, laden with his traps that include some captured Infected. During the game, Joel finds Bill in the hope that Bill will pay off a debt by fixing up a car for Joel and Ellie to drive to Tommy's community, but Bill insists that the only working car battery is in the unexplored part of town. After fighting their way to the local high school, Bill discovers the battery he was going to use is missing. They escape the swarms of infected surrounding the school, and find themselves in an abandoned house, where Bill discovers his former partner, Frank, has committed suicide by hanging; it is revealed that the two had had a falling out and Frank had been planning to escape in Bill's car. After getting the car started, Joel drops Bill off and expresses sympathy for what happened between him and Frank. Bill merely responds by ensuring that their debt is settled and then ordering Joel to leave his town. In The Last of Us Part II, set four years later, Ellie tells Dina about Bill and his traps. Bill's appearance was designed to reflect practicality, as opposed to self-expression; most of his clothing and gear can also be used as a survival tool. Bill is revealed to be homosexual at one point in the game. Druckmann initially left this vague in the script, but was inspired at the script read-through to alter a few lines to further reflect Bill's sexuality. To make Bill interesting, Druckmann explored the concept of contradictory statements; while Bill states that becoming attached to people will lower chances of survival, it is revealed that he had a partner that he really cared for. Bill's role in the game was also to voice Joel's concerns about escorting Ellie, as Joel doesn't voice them. \\"[T]he reason to have Bill there is that Bill can actually say that to Joel, and warn Joel about that stuff,\\" Druckmann said. Sam Einhorn of GayGamer.net felt that the revelation of Bill's sexuality \\"added to his character ... without really tokenizing him\\". American organization GLAAD named Bill one of the \\"most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013\\", calling him \\"deeply flawed but wholly unique\\". =Henry and Sam= Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter) are two brothers that Ellie and Joel encounter while trying to escape from a group of hunters in Pittsburgh. Henry is 25 years old, while Sam is thirteen. Joel and Henry initially think each other are hostile, until they see Sam and Ellie, respectively. Like Joel, Henry is an experienced survivor, and the two decide to team up, since both pairs are looking for the Fireflies. They work together to overpower the bandits guarding the exit to the Quarantine Zone, and escape to an abandoned radio tower in the Suburbs. There, Joel and Henry bond over their mutual love of motorbikes, but Sam becomes morose and introverted, particularly after a conversation with Ellie over death and the Infected. The next day, it emerges that Sam was bitten while escaping the Suburbs, and he attacks Ellie, forcing Henry to kill him. Overcome with grief and guilt at his brother's death, Henry commits suicide with his gun. Both the physical appearance and behavior of Henry and Sam were designed to reflect that of Joel and Ellie; the backpack and jeans worn by both duos reflect the physical resemblance, while the behavioral resemblance was in that they are both forced to make tough decisions over time. After Brandon Scott was chosen to portray Henry, the team only showed him some artistic sketches of the game, avoiding specific details about the story. Scott enjoyed portraying the character, particularly due to the fact that he was allowed to introduce elements of his own personality. \\"You don't have to plan [the little nuances] ... because you get to just be the character,\\" Scott said. He also felt that recording the voice and actions simultaneously was \\"exciting\\" and helpful. The team felt that Henry's actions are dedicated to protecting Sam, and that Scott introduced that dedication to the character. Druckmann stated that Henry and Sam's relationship mirrored that of Joel and Ellie's. Ellie was seen by the team as a mentor to Sam. Johnson felt that Sam was \\"genuinely scared\\", admiring this significant difference from the game's other characters. =David= Veteran voice actor alt=A 44-year-old man with short, brown hair, talking into a microphone, and smiling to the right of the camera. David (Nolan North) is the leader of a group of cannibals that Ellie runs into at the Lakeside Resort where she is sheltering Joel while he recovers from a grievous wound. Initially, Ellie runs into him and a fellow hunter after killing a deer, and he offers to trade the deer for some penicillin for Joel. After he and Ellie are forced to fend off a swarm of infected, David reveals that he is actually the leader of the gang of hunters that Ellie and Joel had killed previously at the University of Eastern Colorado, when Joel was injured. He allows Ellie to get away, but later tracks her down and kidnaps her, taking her to his base in the town. There, Ellie discovers that David's gang are cannibals. She resists their attempts, manages to kill his assistant and flees into the town, while David and his gang stalk her. David eventually corners her in a restaurant, and stalks her for several minutes, as it burns down. Eventually, he manages to pin her down and tries to strangle her, but she catches hold of his machete and swings it, knocking him off her, and brutally hacks him to death, before Joel arrives and pulls her off. David's physical posture and gestures were specifically designed to suggest a warm and caring nature, making players believe his acceptance to welcome Ellie to his community. Veteran voice actor Nolan North, who portrays protagonist Nathan Drake in Naughty Dog's Uncharted series, was chosen to play the role of David. When approached by Druckmann about the role, North immediately accepted the part, appreciating its diversity from his previous acting roles. When portraying David, North was required to change his voice to fit the role. The first voice he proposed to Druckmann was ultimately chosen for the game; he describes it as \\"very quiet ... and the voice can break a little\\". To portray the character, North approached his personality from multiple perspectives, viewing David as a \\"survivor\\". North empathized with David, stating that most of David's actions were understandable when considering the apocalyptic situation. He felt that David was initially attempting to protect Ellie, who was viewed as a \\"glimmer of hope\\". Prior to the writing of the script, David was referred to as the \\"cannibal king\\", and it was known that Ellie would encounter an enemy that would change her. When North was cast, the team found it interesting to make David charismatic, and infatuated with Ellie. =Riley= Riley Abel (Yaani King) is Ellie's best friend. Appearing in the Left Behind additional content, Ellie and Riley became friends at the military boarding school where Ellie was sent when she turned thirteen, where at some point Riley left to join the Fireflies. At the start of Left Behind, she returns after a long absence, and ambushes Ellie in her room. The two go to their old hangout in an abandoned shopping mall, where they fight over Riley's revelation that she will soon be posted to another city. Ellie eventually supports her decision, but as the two dance together before parting, Ellie becomes tearful, and begs Riley not to leave. Without hesitation, Riley rips her dog tags off, deciding to choose Ellie instead of the Fireflies. Moved, Ellie impulsively kisses her, which she returns. Overjoyed, Riley and Ellie are pondering how to proceed when they are attacked by infected. Both sustain bites, and decide to embrace in their final hours together. Riley turns, while Ellie does not. King prepared for the role of Riley by studying the single- player campaign of The Last of Us, as well as the comic book The Last of Us: American Dreams (2013). She stated that Riley has \\"an extremely strong personality, very driven, very confident for a 16-year-old\\". King felt that Riley and Ellie have a really close friendship, requiring each other to survive. She noted that they care about each other, and that they can both rely on their relationship. She also saw Riley as Ellie's mentor, helping her discover new perspectives in the world. =Sarah= Sarah (Hana Hayes) is Joel's twelve-year-old daughter, whom he had when he was in his late teens, and the game's first playable character. The posters and photos on her wall suggest that she was a keen soccer player. At the start of the game, she gives her father a new watch for his birthday. In the early hours of the next day, she is awoken by a commotion and the sound of Tommy phoning Joel. Later, Joel bursts into his office, pulls a revolver out of his desk drawer and shoots their neighbor. Sarah leaves with Tommy and Joel, but her leg is hurt in a crash, forcing Joel to carry her. On the outskirts of their hometown, they come across a soldier, who follows his orders and shoots at them. Sarah is fatally wounded by bullets and dies in Joel's arms. The team felt that Sarah's physical appearance should feel authentic, displaying her relationship with Joel, while simultaneously establishing her as a distinct character. They aimed to establish the character as \\"a down-to-earth girl who shares many qualities with Ellie\\". On the relationship between Joel and Sarah, Hayes felt that they are \\"more like best friends than father and daughter\\", citing their playfulness and humor with each other. Hayes felt intimidated during her audition, due to her inexperience with video game performances. She found it difficult to perform lines in the recording studio, preferring to perform them with the body movements; she believed that the latter felt more natural. To perform Sarah's death, Hayes forced herself to remember and experience previous moments in her life, such as her grandfather's death. =Other characters= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"font-size:100%\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10%;\\"  Character ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10%;\\"  Actor ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:80%\\"  Details - ! Robert  Robin Atkin Downes  Robert is an arms dealer, who was supposed to sell weapons to Joel and Tess. When he instead sells the guns to the Fireflies, Joel and Tess infiltrate his warehouse, ultimately finding him and executing him. - ! Maria  Ashley Scott  Maria is Tommy's wife, and Joel's sister-in-law. Maria and her father ran a settlement in Jackson County shortly after the outbreak of the infection. When Joel and Ellie visit the settlement, Maria opposes Joel's suggestion for Tommy to escort Ellie to the Fireflies, as she is scared that he would come to danger. Ultimately, Joel continues on his journey with Ellie, and Tommy returns to the settlement with Maria. The team aimed for Maria's clothing and demeanor to reflect her \\"strong and fiercely capable nature\\". Scott originally auditioned for the role of Tess; when the team required an actor for Maria, they immediately contacted Scott. She reprised the role for The Last of Us Part II. - ! James  Reuben Langdon  James is David's assistant. He was hunting with David upon their encounter with Ellie, during which he was ordered to gather some supplies from their base. When he returns, he discovers Ellie holding David at gunpoint, but is ordered to avoid conflict; Ellie ultimately leaves. When David later captures Ellie, he and James prepare to kill her, restraining her against a table. When Ellie informs them of her infection, James' grip loosens, and Ellie takes advantage of this by stabbing him with a knife, killing him. Druckmann felt that Langdon added a dynamic between James and David, in which there is conflict between the two characters, but they still respect each other. - ! Frank   Frank is Bill's ex-partner. A letter that Frank wrote before killing himself reveals that Bill's growing paranoia and set-in-his- ways attitude had led to the end of their relationship, and Frank had been intending to take the usable battery, fix up a car and escape Bill's town for good. - ! Ish   Ish is an unseen survivor. Through a series of letters, notes and diary entries found over the course of the sewer mission in the Suburbs, it is revealed that Ish, a fisherman by profession, had set up shelter in a sewer just after beaching his boat, and later accepted some travelers who had children with them to join him. Over some time, the sewers had turned into a thriving commune, but it came to an end when, after someone accidentally left a door to the outside open, a swarm of infected attacked and killed many of the inhabitants. A final note from Ish in one of the nearby houses reveals that he had made it out alive with a few people. Kotaku called the story of Ish \\"the hardest lesson\\" learned in The Last of Us: Ish is a better person than Joel, but his kindness got other people killed. } Reception The characters received acclaim. Eurogamer's Welsh found that the characters were developed with \\"real patience and skill\\", appreciating their emotional value, and Joystiq's Mitchell found the relationships \\"genuine\\" and emotional. Kelly of Computer and Video Games found the characters \\"richly painted\\", feeling invested in their stories. GameSpot's Carolyn Petit felt that the game's sense of humanity is positively reflected through the characters. Tom Hoggins of The Daily Telegraph called the characters \\"complex\\" and \\"flawed\\", stating that they help the game maintain \\"its own identity\\". The character performances also received praise, with Edge noting that the script improved as a result. Eurogamer's Oli Welsh repeated similar remarks, naming the performances \\"sympathetic and understated\\". IGN's Colin Moriarty called the voice acting \\"consistently superb\\", and Matt Helgeson of Game Informer felt that the actors realistically \\"convey the heavy emotional toll placed on each character\\". Jim Sterling of Destructoid felt that the voice acting is \\"impeccably performed\\", resulting in \\"genuine and credible\\" characters. Kotaku's Kirk Hamilton remarked that the actors \\"have an uncommon chemistry and fearlessly tackle their roles\\", praising their delivery of the emotional material. Some of the actors were awarded for their performances; Troy Baker won awards from Hardcore Gamer and the Spike VGX 2013, while Ashley Johnson received two BAFTAs and a DICE Award, as well as awards from the Spike VGX and The Daily Telegraph. Many critics discussed the game's depiction of female characters. Jason Killingsworth of Edge praised its lack of sexualized female characters, writing that it \\"offers a refreshing antidote to the sexism and regressive gender attitudes of most blockbuster videogames\\". Eurogamer's Ellie Gibson praised Ellie as \\"sometimes strong, sometimes vulnerable, but never a clich√©\\". She felt that Ellie is initially established as a \\"damsel in distress\\", but that this concept is subverted. GameSpot's Carolyn Petit praised the female characters as morally conflicted and sympathetic, but wrote that gender in video games should be evaluated \\"based on their actual merits, not in relation to other games\\". Chris Suellentrop of The New York Times acknowledged that Ellie was a likable and \\"sometimes powerful\\" character, but argued that The Last of Us is \\"actually the story of Joel\\", stating that it's \\"another video game by men, for men and about men\\". The Last of Us was also praised for its depiction of LGBT characters. A kiss between two female characters in Left Behind was met with positive reactions.

Early life  Croker was born as Marianne Nicholson. Croker's father was Francis Nicholson, a leading watercolourist. Croker had a brother, Alfred.  Career  Some time after 1818, Croker and her brother Alfred made the acquaintance of Thomas Crofton Croker, then a civil servant with antiquarian interests. The three made a number of trips to the south of Ireland to gather material for a proposed publication ‚Äì Researches in the South of Ireland (1824) ‚Äì to which Marianne contributed illustrations. In Marianne, Thomas Croker found a partner who shared his interests and talents, and the two made numerous visits to Ireland in support of Thomas's later publications dealing with Celtic folklore. Marianne's extensive contributions to Thomas's work are largely unacknowledged. Croker was the author of two books, Barney Mahoney and My Village Versus Our Village ‚Äì both published at her request under her husband's name. She also exhibited a number of landscape paintings.  Personal life  In 1830, Croker married Thomas Crofton Croker, a civil servant with interests in antiquity. They had one child, Thomas Francis Dillon Croker, an amateur antiquary and poet.

Markley (August 29, 1935 ‚Äì September 9, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter and record producer who co-founded the psychedelic rock band, The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, in the late 1960s, and became one of the most controversial figures that emerged from the era. Early life Markley was the adopted son of an oil tycoon. He became a law graduate, and then, a local television persona for the Oklahoma programming, Oklahoma Bandstand in 1958. He performed in several college bands and by 1960, started a decade-long music career. Early music career In 1960, Markley moved to Los Angeles to pursue a music career. He was signed by Warner Bros. Records to release his first single, \\"Will We Meet Again\\", paired with \\"Tia Juana Ball\\", which was distributed in late 1960. Markley sang, and played bongos. By late 1961, another single emerged on the same label, \\"Summers Comin' On\\", backed by \\"It Should Have Been Me\\". All of the songs were either written or co-written by Markley with composer Baker Knight, who later wrote \\"Shifting Sands\\" for The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band on their second album, Part One, in 1967. Markley's solo career, however, stalled after the singles met with very little success. These rare compositions which rested in obscurity for decades were re-distributed on the 2011 compilation album, The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band Companion. Before the end of 1965, Markley was introduced by his friend Kim Fowley, to a band, Laughing Wind. The band performed at a concert that also included The Yardbirds, which took place in Markley's mansion in Los Angeles after The Yardbirds could not book any other performance. Many directors and musicians including Jeff Beck and Jim McGuinn of The Byrds were also present as guests in the sizable gathering. The Laughing Wind comprised Markley's future bandmates Michael Lloyd, Danny Harris, and Shaun Harris. Markley was less concerned about the band's actual performance than he was with the crowd a rock band brought, particularly young women. His obsession with young girls would be part of Markley's personality that would directly affect his later music. Markley proposed that he join and fund the band. The group reluctantly accepted Markley's offer, and The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band was formed. The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band Using his legal expertise, Markley quickly controlled the name and productions of the band. Tracks on all the band's albums, except Where's My Daddy?, had Markley listed as the primary composer, even if he took no part in any actual writing. Markley did write some basic compositions during the band's existence, like \\"1906\\", which fitted well into the psychedelic rock era of the late sixties. However, as his career with the band progressed, Markley's lyrics became more explicit in their references to underage girls. Several of his compositions were released as singles. Markley strived to achieve compositions equal to his bandmates', but with his sometimes disturbing lyrics, they did not sell successfully. Despite his lacking skills as a musician, Markley's input became key to the overall sound and style of the band. With the band, Markley produced six albums, one of which was under the name Markley A Group. While Markley contributed spoken word and backing vocals, the 1966 lineup had Danny Harris playing lead guitar, Shaun Harris at bass guitar, and Michael Lloyd with rhythm guitar. The addition of John Ware on drums completed the group. Lead vocals were shared among the band members, as determined by Markley. After their minor FiFo Records album consisting mostly of Laughing Wind recordings, Volume One was released, Markley's influence helped the band sign to the Reprise label for three albums, and smaller independent labels for the final two releases. The band was able to produce a wide variety of music ranging from folk rock, to guitar-led freakbeat, and multilayered, avant-garde compositions. Their most acclaimed album, 1968's Volume 3: A Child's Guide to Good and Evil, has been considered a psychedelic masterpiece. The band's popularity as a live act came from their elaborate light shows which, according to Ware, were \\"the ultimate street happening for a while\\". Markley's role in the performances was restricted to tambourines and on occasions, backing vocals. However, the band's live performances did little to save the band from disbanding in 1970, after the album Markley A Group. Later life and death Markley continued to work in the music business as a record producer, most notably on Jim Stallings' (a.k.a. J. J. Light) album, Heya!. Markley collaborated with Lloyd and Danny Harris on a gospel album called Goodness and Mercy, but, after the album's release, Markley dropped out of the music scene altogether. He lived a bohemian lifestyle after purchasing a smaller residence in Los Angeles in his efforts to interest women. Authorities attempted to arrest Markley on undisclosed charges involving two young women, but he temporarily evaded the law. However, with his interest in underage girls resulting in convictions on other occasions, he ultimately changed his name to avoid scrutiny. Combined with the traumatic event of losing his father and declining mental stability, Markley's health slowly deteriorated throughout his life. He showed himself sporadically to past band members and looked more obviously ill with each appearance. Bob Markley died on September 9, 2003, in Los Angeles, but the cause of his death was not reported.

In 2000, during the dot-com bubble, the company was valued at over $50 billion and Buckley's 3.5% stake made him a multi-billionaire on paper at the age of 40. In 2017, the company announced the sale of its majority-owned assets and that it would monetize its remaining assets and return capital to shareholders. Early life and education Buckley grew up in a prominent Bethlehem area family. His father ran a money management business called Buckley & Meuthing and his grandfather ran Buckley Brothers, also a money management firm. Buckley attended Moravian Academy from Kindergarten through sixth grade, and Episcopal Academy from seventh grade through high school. He then attended University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. While in school, Buckley was motivated more by sports than business and starred on the North Carolina soccer team. His coach, legendary Anson Dorrance recalled \\"He played with wonderful, physical, reckless abandon\\", leaving it all on the field. Career In 1983 through 1985, Buckley spent three years working as a Commercial Loan Officer and in the Loan Reclamation Department at Philadelphia National Bank, later called CoreStates Financial Corporation. In 1986, Buckley co-founded a medical supply company called Centralized Management Systems, which was sold in 1987. In 1988, Buckley joined Safeguard Scientifics, a venture capital firm. From 1991 to 1996, Buckley was the Vice President of Acquisitions at Safeguard. There, he oversaw the acquisitions of a number of companies including ChromoVision, Diamond Technology, Video Server, and XL Vision. =Internet Capital Group= Buckley and fellow Safeguard executive Ken Fox noticed an emerging market in e-commerce business-to-business and left Safeguard in February 1996 to found a venture capital firm, Internet Capital Group (later shortened to ICG). They asked Safeguard head Pete Musser for $5 million in funding, but he insisted on investing $15 million. Buckley and Fox raised $40 million to start ICG, twice what they wanted. In addition to Safeguard, major investors included Comcast, Compaq, and BancBoston Ventures. Buckley served as the CEO and president of the company from March 1996 to December 2001, at which time he became the company's Chairman, a position he continues to hold. ICG invested $1.4 billion in 61 start-up firms; and an article declared that \\"Buckley put B2B on the map\\". In August 1999, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, offering stock for sale at $12 per share. By December 1999, the stock was trading at over $200 per share and Buckley's stake of 10,000,000 shares, or 3.5% of the company, was worth over $2 billion. By November 2000, the stock was down to $11 per share and after the September 11 attacks it traded for 20 cents per share. Buckley sold very little of his stock and remained optimistic. After ICG survived the crash, paid down the debt and changed its business model to move towards an operating model. Instead of taking small stakes in many companies, it invested in a few \\"core\\" companies at a time, as a majority owner. This allowed the company to have much greater control over the operations of its investments. Buckley refocused the company to find strategic partnerships with traditional industry leaders such as a joint venture with DuPont called CapSpan in early 2000. In September 2014, when the company changed its name to Actua Corporation, its stock was trading around $6 per share and was worth approximately $200 million. In 2017, the company sold its three majority-owned businesses and in 2018 announced a voluntarily liquidation whereby it would seek to sell its remaining assets while winding down operations. At its closing, Actua distributed close to $18/share and provided a triple return to investors. =Other affiliations= Buckley is a director of several technology startups including Critical Alert, Diagnostic Bio Chips, Dropps and Margaux. He is on the advisory boards of the Carolina Entrepreneurial Initiative, the UNC Kenan‚ÄìFlagler Business School, and the Vetri Foundation and Starfinder Foundation. Previously, he was a director of Breakaway Solutions, Channel Intelligence, Familywyze, ICG Commerce and VerticalNet . Buckley is known for a \\"coach-like style\\" of management that encourages teamwork and camaraderie. Recognition In 2000, Buckley was named the Entrepreneur of the Year by Price Waterhouse, and received the Entrepreneurial Excellence Award from the Greater Philadelphia Venture Group. Buckley's cash compensation is $450,000 per year. Between 2008 and 2014, he received $12 million in compensation. Buckley is a leader in the venture capital and has worked closely with industry names such as David Bookspan of Dreamit Ventures, Ken Fox of Stripes, Matthew J. Safaii of Arrowroot Capital Management, Mark Sugarman of MHS Capital. Personal life Buckley is an avid runner, often traversing a long, rocky hill near the Actua headquarters at Valley Forge National Historical Park. Early American History and the founding of the country is an important passion, and Buckley is currently working on a documentary film. Buckley has two children, Alexa Buckley, co-founder of women's footwear company Margaux, and Dutch Buckley, co-founder of Healthy Human Teas.

Brulle is an American environmental sociologist and professor of sociology and environmental science at Drexel University. He is also an associate professor of public health at the Drexel University School of Public Health. He advocates aggressive political action to address global warming. Education and academic career  Brulle received his B.S. from United States Coast Guard Academy in 1974, his M.A. in sociology from the New School for Social Research in 1981, his M.S. from the University of Michigan in natural resources in 1982, and his PhD from George Washington University in sociology in 1995.Robert J. BrulleCurriculum Vitae Brulle joined the faculty of Drexel University as an assistant professor in 1997. He became an associate professor there in 2003 and a full professor in 2008. Brulle is a faculty member of the Department of Culture and Communication of the College of Arts and Sciences at Drexel. Research Brulle‚Äôs research includes the strategy and funding patterns of what he calls ‚Äúthe climate change countermovement,‚Äù the movement critical of action to address global warming. Brulle was interviewed by Frontline, a public television program that produces and broadcasts in-depth documentaries, for their 2012 documentary on climate change denial titled Climate of Doubt. He described the climate change countermovement as \\"comprehensive\\" and as \\"an add-on to the already-existing conservative movement in the United States.\\" Brulle estimated the total annual income of the nonprofit environmental movement as $2.7 billion, and noted that progress toward a cleaner US environment often comes at the expense of other nations, in a 2009 interview by the Imaginova Corporation published by Fox News. Brulle analysed the funding of organizations associated with the climate change denial movement during a year-long fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. Brulle published results in December 2013 in Climatic Change, a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal. According to Brulle, it was \\"the first peer-reviewed, comprehensive analysis ever conducted of the funding behind climate change denial.\\" Brulle's study estimated that the 91 organizations he examined had a total annual income of just above $900 million, and that the vast majority of funds donated to such organizations came from conservative foundations. Over the eight years covered by the study (2003-2010), the American Enterprise Institute received the most funding‚Äî16% of the total funds, and the donor-advised funds Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund were the largest funders. The study also found that the amount of money donated to these organizations by means of Donors Trust and other foundations whose funding sources cannot be traced has risen dramatically over the previous five years. The report was covered by the Washington Post, Forbes, Scientific American, The Guardian, Science Daily, and the International Science Times. The research was featured in the public information website on climate change from the Governor of California's Office of Planning and Research. A senior fellow from the Heartland Institute, one of the organizations included in the study, writing in an opinion piece in Forbes, criticized Brulle's work and its media coverage on a number of points, including that the organizations included in the study had diverse agendas, and not all of their revenue was devoted to climate change education. Bruelle acknowledged in the PBS interview, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say how many dollars went from this foundation to this organization specifically for climate change. . . .‚Äù Brulle collaborated on research into factors affecting US public opinion on climate change, and found that politicians are more influential than scientists. The research was featured by National Geographic and USA Today. Political activity Brulle endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

History Teenage Engineering was founded in 2005 by Jesper Kouthoofd, Jens Rudberg, David Eriksson and later joined by David M√∂llerstedt, who previously headed the audio department at EA DICE. Their first product, the OP-1, was introduced at the NAMM Show in 2010. Shortly after release, Teenage Engineering produced several \\"accessories\\", which could be used to manipulate the unit's input knobs. Following the success of the OP-1, the company began working with the Stig Carlsson Foundation to develop the OD-11 speaker, inspired by a speaker of the same name manufactured by Sonab and designed by Swedish designer Stig Carlsson in 1974. It was well received for its minimalist design, a faithful reproduction of the original, and for its sound quality. Despite two early appearances at the Consumer Electronics Show and an original release date of Summer 2013, it was not released until 2014. Teenage Engineering aimed to maintain Carlsson's goal of designing a speaker for use in a \\"regular home\\", rather than one designed to be used in an unrealistically ideal, noiseless environment. In 2013, the company collaborated with the Swedish clothing company Cheap Monday after ordering new work uniforms from them; Kouthoofd had previously collaborated with creative director, Ann-Sofie Back. The companies jointly announced the Pocket Operator (PO-10) synthesizer series in January 2015. The series includes three models: PO-12 rhythm, a drum machine; PO-14 sub, a bass synthesizer; and PO-16 factory, a lead synthesizer. Each model doubles as a 16-step sequencer. According to CEO Jesper Kouthoofd, Teenage Engineering sought to design synthesizers that would retail for ; however, each PO actually retails for . The POs target musicians seeking a less expensive alternative to the OP-1, which currently retails for . The series uses a minimalist design, evoking pocket calculators and, according to Kouthoofd, Nintendo's Game & Watch games. Sonically, they emulate vintage synthesizers, in response to the contemporary surge in the popularity of retro style electronic music gear. The synthesizers debuted at the 2015 NAMM Show. The Pocket Operators were a success at NAMM, and sales were estimated by third parties to be as high as 40,000 units, which delayed shipments by up to three months. The PO-20 series of the Pocket Operators were introduced at the 2016 NAMM show. The PO-20 synthesizers have some additional effects and functionality that were not present in the original PO-10 series, but maintain the price point. The PO-30 series further elaborates upon the original Pocket operators by adding a drum synthesizer made in collaboration with MicroTonic, a sampler, and a voice synthesizer. These were released starting in late 2017 at a slightly increased price from previous series. PO-30 devices feature a microphone for use in recording audio samples and for transferring data. In 2018, Teenage Engineering announced a new line of audio equipment products, Frekvens, in collaboration with IKEA. The modular system takes visual cues from Bauhaus design. Founder Kouthoofd had previously collaborated with IKEA on Kn√§ppa, a camera made of cardboard. On May 22, 2019, Panic announced Playdate, a new handheld video game console designed in collaboration with Teenage Engineering. The device features a mechanical crank which is specifically credited to Teenage Engineering. Awards and accolades The OP-1 has won awards for its design and sound engines. * The OP-1 synthesizer won one of ten of Sweden's Design S Awards in 2012. The award committee described the OP-1 as \\"A technological product which through a clever colour scheme and fantastic graphics is intuitive, easily accessible and incredibly inviting. Music and machine in one\\". * In 2014, the OP-1 was awarded second prize in Georgia Tech's Margaret Guthman Musical Instrument Competition. * In 2017, the Pocket Operator series was awarded a Good Design Award by the Japan Institute of Design Promotion. The Institute noted that while the functions of the devices were not immediately clear, the format \\"inspires a desire to press the buttons\\". Musicians Musicians who use Teenage Engineering products include Kevin Parker, frontman of Tame Impala, Beck, Bon Iver, Depeche Mode, Kings Kaleidoscope, Low, Miike Snow, Drew Shirley of Switchfoot, Housemeister, Damian Kulash of OK Go, Chicago producer Monte Booker, Swedish House Mafia and Lauren Mayberry of CHVRCHES.

He reigned from 1596 to 1608 (Some other Sulu Tarsilas or genealogical records say he reigned from 1585 to 1600). He was the son of the previous Sultan Muhammad ul-Halim, also known as Pangiran Buddiman. The title \\"Batara\\" in his name is a reference to Brunei annals, which used the title \\"Batara\\" to identify rulers of Sulu as there were numerous cases of intermarriage between the 2 royal houses. \\"Shah\\" may have been his actual given name or another royal title, referencing the Persian royal title. \\"Tengah\\" on the other hand, was another title, or an indication of birth order, as this meant he was in between an older brother and a younger brother. During his reign, he was known for being an intelligent and respectable ruler of Sulu, as well as an advocate of the Sharia Law in his domains. His reign also marked the end of the first phase of the Spanish-Moro Conflict, a conflict to span 3 centuries, throughout the Spanish colonisation of the Philippines. Moro raids began to frequent during his reign, with slave-raiding parties from many of his subjects across Sulu beginning to terrorise and ravage the coasts of the Philippines and its environs.  Early life  During his father's reign, Sulu gained de facto independence and trading rights from the Bruneian Empire. In 1578, the same year Sulu gained freedom, the Spaniards sent a military expedition that ended in Pangiran Buddiman's agreement on a regular tribute of pearls to be sent from Sulu to Spanish Manila, however due to multiple military expeditions carried out by the now independent Sulu Sultanate in and around the Visayas, no such tribute would again be given during Buddiman's reign, much less during the reign of any of his successors. Very little is known of Tengah's early life in Sulu. What is known, however is that he was the 2nd of 3 sons and an unknown number of daughters. What happened to these other possible heirs to Sulu is not known. As an official prince of Sulu, he was given the princely title of \\"Pangiran\\" which was given to all possible heirs to the Sultanate. He was a direct descendant of the first rulers of Sulu.  Reign  = Accession to the throne = Some Sulu genealogies put the beginning of his reign at 1585, others state the beginning of his reign as 1596. Whichever date is true, what is known as fact is that he was crowned and proclaimed Sultan almost immediately after his father's death. His coronation was recognised by the different Chiefs or Datus of Sulu, who were now his subjects. = Administration = His reign saw little reform in the Sulu ruling and kinship system which was established nearly a century ago by his ancestors. However, the independence of the Sultanate saw immense economic growth and stronger presence in the region. Sultan Tengah used this economic rise to his advantage, winning over numerous chiefs and subordinate rulers to his side. He no longer had to be dependent of Brunei's economy or military and much less pay Brunei any tribute. This made his lands extremely wealthy. He was known for being incredibly wise and intelligent in ruling the Sultanate. He was also considered a \\"tidy\\" ruler, who kept himself clean and presentable to any chief, this reflected the situation of the young state, who had to prove to its benefactor Brunei, that it was capable of self-governance, and to show a cultured face to the intruding Spaniards, who have opted to make war with the Sulus.  Sharia Law  He also acted as a judge for his people and he was known for his knowledge of the Sharia code of laws which he used to govern his people. His reign can be considered an Islamic oriented one due to the widespread use of the Sharia law throughout his domains.  Relations with Brunei  Just a few decades earlier, due to a Spanish attempt to bring Sulu out of Brunei's influence, Sulu gained de facto independence from Brunei. This, however did not mean an end to their friendship as states. Sultan Tengah arranged for the marriage of his sister to the Sultan Hassan of Brunei. He also took the title Batara, a Bruneian title for Sulu royalty. The marrying off of a female member of the family to another was a known gesture, indicating the superiority of the receiving party in those days. Islam was also a connecting factor for the 2 Sultanates. Islamic preachers or Panditas regularly travelled from Brunei to Sulu to evangelise the people there. Militarily, the marriage of Sultan Hassan of Brunei with a Sulu princess begot a son, Muwallil Wasit or Rajah Bongsu who would later become the Sulu sultan himself after his uncle, Sultan Tengah's death.  Relations with Spain  Sultan Tengah not only inherited an independent and economically stable state from his father when he became Sultan. He also inherited his father's main enemy, the Spaniards. Ever since the Spanish intrusion and colonisation of the Philippines the Muslim states of the Southern Philippines have been threatened by the new Spanish enemy. Though he was not one for military conflict, he was constantly under attack by the Spaniards. The last major Spanish expedition to Sulu was in 1579, under the command of Captain Juan Acre de Sadornil, the Spaniards led an expedition to Sulu and Mindanao. The expedition was decisively beaten by Sulu. However, in 1593, the Spaniards did succeed in establishing their first ever Catholic mission established by the Jesuits in Samboangan (Sama word for Sabuan, A docking point) at Caldera bay (present-day Recodo). This settlement was short- lived, due to fierce Muslim resistance that threatened to destroy the settlement. When Sultan Tengah ascended to the throne around 1596, the Spaniards sent and expedition once again to make war with Sulu. They attacked the capital of Sulu, Bauang (known to the Spaniards and later renamed as Jolo). However, this expedition was beaten decisively by the Sulus, under the command of Sultan Tengah's nephew, Rajah Bongsu, or Muwallil Wasit who was sent from Brunei to aid the Sulus militarily. For this act of bravery, Muwallil Wasit was named Adapati or protector of Sulu, while Sultan Tengah continued to rule as Sultan. In November 1596, the Manila Spanish government sent Juan Ronquillo to build fortified military garrison in Tampakan to thwart Moro slave raids that began to escalate in number and severity, as Sulu's maritime power increased. But abandoned it the following year to re-position itself to Caldera bay in the Zamboanga Peninsula. Another expedition was sent by the Spaniards in 1598, however, the Manila Spaniards experienced severe drawbacks and returned to Manila, with no confrontation taking place. This was the last major expedition sent by the Spaniards during Sultan Tengah's reign, marking the end of the first phase of the Spanish-Moro wars. Slave raiding continued as an uninterrupted activity, sanctioned by Sultan Tengah himself to enjoy its economic benefits to the Sultanate. = Dynastic Disputes = Early on during his reign, it is believed that a cousin of his, known only by the name Adasaolan, attempted to usurp the throne from him. Due to dynastic troubles such as this, Sultan Tengah was dependent of his nephew, Rajah Bongsu, or Muwallil Wasit to protect Sulu, particularly when Sultan Tengah, just newly crowned as ruler had to face the Spaniards in 1596. He was not known as a military-oriented leader and often solved disputes within his domains peacefully and diplomatically. After the Spaniards' last ill-fated expedition, Muwallil Wasit was called back to Brunei where his family was and Sultan Tengah continued to protect his throne from his cousin and usurper. Adasaolan even married a Maguindanao princess to further contest his cousin's right to rule. However, Sultan Tengah, more beloved by his people and favoured by Brunei, maintained the throne and continued to rule Sulu prosperously.  Issue and Death  Sultan Batara Shah Tengah begot no known children, and therefore had no heir. Sulu was relatively stable and the economy continued to rise during the latter part of his reign. His usurper was dealt with, but the major candidates for the throne were unclear. Upon his death in 1608, Brunei, fearing another dynastic conflict, this time, a much worse one, due to the lack of a ruler for Sulu dispatched Pangiran Muwallil Wasit to Sulu to assert his rights as Sultan. He was a great military leader after all, and had inherited a growing and powerful state on the rise.

Biography The daughter of a prominent English solicitor, Ellis was born in the northern town of Wigan, near Manchester, in 1874. She studied English literature at Oxford University in the era before women were permitted to take degrees there. In 1899 she published An English girl's first impressions of Burmah, a humorous account of a recent six-month stay in what is today Myanmar, then part of British India. Six novels and a collection of short stories followed. Most of these books were historical romances.

Assessing her final novel in 1913, the reviewer for The Bookman (London) wrote: \\"Among present-day writers of historical novels I should place Miss Beth Ellis very highly.

Negative reviews tended to deprecate Ellis's choice of genre, rather than her competence within it. As The New York Times wrote of her fourth novel in 1910: \\"The book is a good one of its kind. But, of course, some censorious reader will inevitably ask: 'Has not its kind been done to death?'\\"New York Times Saturday review of books, 30 July 1910, p. 424.

Rath offers artist-quality and student instruments in its line of tenor, bass, contrabass and alto trombones. Rath Trombones was founded in 1996 by instrument technician Michael Rath, and is Britain's only trombone manufacturer. Rath's 12 craftspeople create as many as 500 trombones per year, exporting instruments through 25 distributors in North and South America, Japan, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Taiwan. History Company founder Michael Rath (b. 1963 in Slough, Berkshire, England) studied musical instrument technology at Merton Technical College in South London. He finished at Merton in 1981 and for the next nine years served an apprenticeship with Paxman Musical Instruments, a Covent Garden-based manufacturer of (French) horns. Himself a brass player ‚Äì he began on tuba at age 11 ‚Äì Rath opened his own brass instrument shop in West Yorkshire, specialising in repairs and customisation. His clientele grew to include professional musicians, particularly trombonists, from throughout Europe. In 1995, British jazz trombonist Mark Nightingale asked Rath to create a bespoke instrument. Completed in 1996 after nearly two years of prototyping, this tenor instrument became the first Rath trombone. With tenor trombones in steady production, Michael Rath, along with technicians Andy Hutchinson and Adrian Davison, began development of a full trombone line. Hutchinson crafted bells, Davison the hands slides, and Rath did the remainder himself. Over the next decade the Rath catalogue grew to include small-bore jazz trombones, large bore symphonic instruments, bass, contrabass and alto models. Rath instruments grew increasingly popular in Europe, while less known in the U.S. Rath Trombones faced setbacks, including cash-flow problems and the increasing demands of production on what began as a three-person shop. Another blow came in 2006, when respected trombone slide specialist Adrian Davison died at the age of 28 in a motorcycle accident. Today, Rath trombones are popular with solo artists and brass band, symphony and jazz trombone sections around the world. Their reputation has been enhanced with representation at regional and international trade shows and conventions of musicians and music educators, and a growing roster of high-profile endorsing artists. A line of student- level instruments, JP/Rath Trombones, was introduced in 2014 in collaboration with UK instrument distributor John Packer, and is manufactured by Rath- trained technicians. The Rath Trombones shop is located in Honley, Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, United Kingdom. In 2015, the shop was selected from hundreds of UK businesses for a visit by Anne, Britain's Princess Royal.

O'Brien Lock & Dam, one of two major locks in the CAWS The Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) is a complex of natural and artificial waterways extending through much of the Chicago metropolitan area, covering approximately 87 miles altogether. It straddles the Chicago Portage and is the sole navigable inland link between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River and makes up the northern end of the Illinois Waterway. The CAWS includes various branches of the Chicago and Calumet Rivers, as well as other channels such as the North Shore Channel, Cal-Sag Channel, and Chicago Sanitary & Ship Canal. The CAWS ends near the Lockport Navigational Pool, the highest elevated of the eight pools of the Illinois Waterway. There are three major locks within the CAWS, operated by the Army Corps of Engineers: the Chicago Harbor Lock, the Lockport Lock & Dam, and the Thomas J. O'Brien Lock & Dam. Artificial waterways connecting the Mississippi and Great Lakes systems via the Chicago area, over the Chicago Portage, began with the I&M; Canal in 1848. The CAWS as it exists today began to take shape in 1900, with the construction of the Chicago Sanitary & Ship Canal to reverse the flow of the Chicago and Calumet Rivers, which previously flowed into Lake Michigan, so as to instead flow toward the Mississippi River, thus carrying sewage away from the city of Chicago. Thereafter additional artificial waterways were built that became part of the CAWS, such as the North Shore Channel, which runs inland from Wilmette to the Chicago River and was constructed in 1910, and the Cal Sag Channel, which provides a direct path from the Calumet River to the Illinois Waterway and was finished in 1922. In the 21st century, a focus of concern around the CAWS has been its potential role as a corridor for Asian carp to enter Lake Michigan. Suits in district court and before the United States Supreme Court have been unable to obtain an injunction requiring the connection between the CAWS and the Mississippi drainage to be closed.

Retrieved 13 February 2015 The existence of SCPs is withheld from the public to prevent mass panic and to allow human civilization to function normally. When an SCP is discovered, the SCP Foundation deploys agents either to collect and transport the SCP to a Foundation facility, or to contain it at its location of discovery if transport is not possible. If an SCP is too widespread, elusive, or otherwise inaccessible, containment consists of suppressing all knowledge of the SCP from the public. Once SCPs are contained, they are studied by Foundation scientists. Test subjects acquired by the Foundation (referred to as D-class) are used to interact with dangerous SCPs due to the danger posed by those SCPs and the expendability of the D-class. The SCP Foundation maintains documentation for all of the SCPs in its custody, which can include or link to related reports and files.

Like Lovecraft, SCP Foundation case files generally lack action sequences and are written in a pseudo-academic tone. Cook-Wilson argued that both Lovecraft's works and those of the SCP Foundation were strengthened by the tensions between their detached scientific tone and the unsettling, horrific nature of the stories being told. Bryan Alexander, writing in The New Digital Storytelling stated that the SCP Foundation is possibly \\"the most advanced achievement of wiki storytelling\\" due to the large-scale and recurring process through which the SCP Foundation's user-base creates literary content.Alexander p. 73 Andrew Paul, writing for Dark(ish) Web on Medium, noted the large variety in style throughout the works and related the short-writing format to current trends in digital media such as Snapchat and Vine.

Projects The flagship project, Indian Mixed Ability Group Events (IMAGE), operates in partnership with the Laureus Sport For Good Foundation, and uses sport as a social vaccine to create Disability Confidence between disabled and non-disabled Indian society.Sport Star Live: \\"Real Heroes in the heart of sports\\"Laureus Sport for Good Foundation The past decade has seen IMAGE progress from an after-school club to a community outreach program. The initiative started in 2005, when IMAGE was piloted at SKSN Institute with 195 of its disabled 8-12 year olds and 195 non-disabled 8-12 year olds from local schools of various socio-economic backgrounds. Over the next 6 years, 18 IMAGE clubs sprang up around Rajasthan, totalling 1200 members.

It was designed by Benjamin Backhouse and built from 1867 to 1913. It is also known as State Emergency Services State Headquarters and former Fortitude Valley Boys School and former Fortitude Valley Girls and Infants School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 March 1999.  History  New school building, Fortitude Valley, July 1950 Two substantial brick buildings form the former Fortitude Valley State School in Brookes Street, Fortitude Valley. The two-storeyed brick building designed by Benjamin Backhouse in 1867 was the former Girls and Infants School. The adjacent single-storey designed by Richard George Suter in 1874 was the former Boys School. Fortitude Valley was settled throughout the 1850s, with a boost to immigrants with the arrival of John Dunmore Lang's free settlers on the ship Fortitude. Denied promised land grants this group moved from York's Hollow, near Wickham Terrace, to what became known as Fortitude Valley. A government census in 1861 showed that there was a total population of over 1300 people in the district by that year. The Fortitude Valley School opened in rented premises in 1861 in Ann Street near Brunswick Street with an average attendance of 140 boys. A girls school joined the boys in 1864. As attendance continued to rise in this flourishing village, the need for a more permanent educational facility ensued. The site in Brookes Street was selected, and the students took up residence in the 1867 two-storeyed building designed by Benjamin Backhouse. As enrolments continued to grow the need to provide additional facilities saw a second building designed by Richard Suter constructed in 1874. The Girls and Infants school were located in the original building and the Boys occupied the new building. The schools were considered separate entities. Both Backhouse and Suter's designs were modelled on the Lancastrian system. This system combined galleried schoolrooms and smaller classrooms for use in conjunction with monitors and pupil teachers. Monitors and pupil teachers used the classrooms for drill learning with small groups while the teacher conducted the main class in the schoolroom. The arrangement of the rooms allowed the school to cope with very large numbers of children in ratio to small numbers of teachers. The 1867 Fortitude Valley School was designed to accommodate 300 children. Benjamin Backhouse was born in Ipswich, England and migrated to Queensland in 1861 after a sojourn to the Victorian goldfields between 1852 and 1860. During his eight years in Brisbane he was to erect more than 100 buildings, drawing from a wide range of public, commercial and private clients. He was architect to the Board of General Education between 1863 and 1868. He designed brick schools for Warwick (Warwick East State School 1864), Maryborough (1866), and Bowen (1866). He supervised the construction of South Brisbane State School (1864) and extended the Brisbane Normal School. He also designed a number of timber schools in the southern part of Queensland before moving south to Sydney in 1869. Richard George Suter was born in London and migrated in 1853. By 1865, Suter was working with Backhouse whilst establishing his own practice. After Backhouse left Queensland in 1868, Suter was offered independent commissions from the Queensland Board of Education. Suter was to develop the use of exposed external studding on timber buildings which was particularly popular in school building constrained by cost and availability of materials. The school closed in December 2013 due to low student numbers, despite a prolonged campaign by parents and students to keep it open. The Queensland Government argued that there was another school only away that could accommodate the students.  Description  Two distinctive and substantial brick buildings on the south side of Brookes Street, Fortitude Valley, between the Fortitude Valley Police Station and the railway line, were the core buildings of the former Fortitude Valley State School. Their decoration and construction details are reminiscent of the Gothic Revival style favoured for ecclesiastical and educational buildings of the time. Within this idiom, these buildings give expression to a more restrained Gothic, displaying a sense of mass solidity and simplicity. Both are lively compositions with decorative textured surfaces and discrete detailing. = Former Girls and Infants School (Benjamin Backhouse 1867) = This free-standing two-storey red face brick building sits on a rusticated Brisbane tuff base. The exterior is now painted. Though asymmetrical, the school is designed to a basilica-like plan with the narthex and nave expressed externally by steeply pitched intersecting gable roofs. The main entrance is from a five-sided apse porch to the east. To the north, a timber single-storey room with gable roof and decorative paired brackets projects from the middle of the nave. The passage between this room and the main building is now enclosed. The verandah to the south is now enclosed and a single storey brick extension has been constructed to the southeast corner off the apse porch and south verandah. The building has battered, banded corners and two horizontal stringcourses to the upper level. The north and south gable fronts have three lancet windows to the upper level each with a plain head-mould. Beneath the eaves, both gable fronts are decorated with crow gable corbelling and three blank bullseye windows. A vertical rectangular louvred vent to the east gable sits above the apse porch. The eaves are supported by plain corbelled brackets and the underside is lined with tongue and groove boards. The words \\"primary school\\" are spelt out in projecting brick on the north side of the nave at the upper floor level. Curved sunhoods with bold brackets and lattice spandrel screens shelter the windows of the ground floor to the west and southwest. The entry and circulation apse opens into a large school room from which two smaller teaching rooms open to the west. The ground and first floor plans are identical. These rooms are now partitioned into office workspaces and meeting rooms. The interiors are plain with stop-chamfering to doors and window frames. The apse stair has stop- chamfered newell posts with ball and half- ball tops and plain rectangular timber post balustrading. Much of the joinery survives. The ceiling to roof of the large school room at the upper level is presently covered by a suspended ceiling of acoustic tiles, but a preliminary investigation reveals that the roof is supported by four collar-braced king- post trusses within a lofty timber lined roof space. The arched pendant posts with decorative corbels survive and are visible beneath the suspended ceiling. A dog-leg stair with half landing has been inserted from the south-west teaching room to the teaching room directly above. In the large school rooms, high set windows to the south and larger lower windows to the north accommodated galleried classes. High set windows to the south and west of the small teaching rooms also accommodated galleried classes. The south verandah is enclosed with weatherboards and louvres and partitioned into toilets. A timber louvre to the former southwest lavatory on the south verandah survives. There are hat/coat hooks along the masonry wall to the verandah. The pavilion extension to the south of the apse is entered from the south verandah. A light and airy room, with a mansard profile sheeted and battened ceiling, it is lit by a bank of south facing windows. = Former Boys School (Richard Suter 1874) = This axially-planned, symmetrical one-storey brick building is east of the former Girls and Infants School and also conforms to a basilica-like plan. Separate, steeply pitched gabled roofs express the narthex and nave and the main entrance is from a five-sided apse porch to the north. The building sits on stone foundations and the verandahs to the east and west rest on low brick piers. The verandahs have been enclosed. The beehive-like corbelling to the eaves of the nave and north gable front is more elaborate than the corbelling on the Girls and Infants School. The apse entry, with a narrow tongue and groove board lined ceiling, opens into the high ceilinged large school room from which two small teaching rooms open to the south. The large school room has been subdivided into two spaces by a vertical tongue and groove lined post and rail framed partition. Both partitioned spaces have a tongue and groove lined ceiling with a plain cornice. There are timber floors throughout. Cambered arched window openings are a feature throughout the building and double arched doors open from the large school room to both verandahs. Windows to the south portion of the large school room are sheeted over and could not be inspected. Windows to the west wall of the north portion have been clumsily replaced but a window to the north east survives. The two small teaching rooms are lit from the south by a bank of casement windows and each opens to its adjacent verandah. The flat sheeted and battened ceiling across these rooms falls with the gable roof slope near the edges of the rooms. Throughout the building door mouldings, window frames, verandah posts and verandah rails are stop-chamfered. Many verandah posts survive within the enclosing boarding, some with capitals intact. There is evidence that there were handrails and balustrading to the verandahs. = Grounds = The former Opportunity School, a number of sheds, masts and a lookout are scattered to the south of the site. Bitumen paths have been laid throughout the site. A bitumen carpark and a gravel parking lot lie to the north of the site. There is haphazard planting to the Brookes Street boundary and close to the buildings. These incidental buildings and plantings are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  Fortitude Valley State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 March 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Two distinctive and substantial brick buildings on the south side of Brookes Street, Fortitude Valley, between the Fortitude Valley Police Station and the railway line were the core buildings of the Fortitude Valley State School. The two buildings are early examples of Queensland public school buildings, demonstrating the evolution of settlement in Brisbane. The 1913 extension to the former Girls' and Infants' School and the dividing partition of the former Boys School are important for demonstrating architectural responses to changes in educational theory. Other alterations indicate architectural responses to the evolution of the operational activities of the Fortitude Valley State School. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. They are rare examples of the Gothic Revival style favoured for ecclesiastical and educational buildings in the nineteenth century. The two buildings are important for their intact interiors including; roof trusses, timber lined ceilings, joinery, and apse stair. The design allowed for large schoolrooms combined with small classrooms that accommodated galleried seating, features essential to the nineteenth century Lancastrian teaching system. They are rare surviving Queensland examples of schools designed to accommodate this system of education. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The two buildings contribute to the Brookes Street streetscape aesthetic, which includes the Holy Trinity Church and Rectory, the Fortitude Valley Police Station and the 1948 Fortitude Valley State School. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The 1867 two-storeyed former Girls' and Infants' School designed by important Queensland architect Benjamin Backhouse, and the 1874 single-storeyed former Boys' School designed by another important Queensland architect Richard George Suter are outstanding examples of their educational work.

It was designed by Hennessey, Hennessey & Co and built in 1934 by P H Turner & Co. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 November 2008.  History  Bulolo Flats, a two-storeyed block of eight self-contained brick flats, was erected in 1934 for Brisbane businessman and politician Thomas Charles Beirne as purpose-designed residential flats for young women working in his TC Beirne Department Store in Fortitude Valley. The building was designed by the prominent architectural firm of Hennessy, Hennessy and Co. of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Thomas Charles Beirne (1860‚Äì1949) had a strong association with the development of retailing in Queensland and with the expansion of Fortitude Valley as a major Brisbane retail centre. Like his contemporaries Michael Daniel Piggott, James McWhirter and Frank McDonnell, Beirne founded a fortune based on the burgeoning retail trade and the transformation of nineteenth-century drapery stores into large twentieth- century department stores. After having trained as a draper in Ireland Beirne had emigrated to Victoria in 1884, where he was employed in a Melbourne drapery store. In 1886, he joined fellow Irishman MD Piggott in partnership in a small retail drapery in South Brisbane. A disastrous fire in the store in 1889 and the dissolution of the partnership in August 1891 resulted in Beirne establishing his own store in Fortitude Valley, which was emerging as a retail centre to rival North and South Brisbane. His business expanded over the succeeding decades to become one of Queensland's leading department stores, with branch stores established at Ipswich (1892) and Mackay (1902). In 1894 James McWhirter was employed as Beirne's manager for one year, became his partner for another three years, then opened his own establishment on the other side of Brunswick Street in Fortitude Valley, in competition to Beirne. The strong rivalry between the Beirne and McWhirter drapery shops and their evolution into large department stores was one of the principal factors in establishing Fortitude Valley as an important retail centre, dominated for the first half of the twentieth century by the two \\"big\\" stores. From 1898 Beirne was an active member of the Brisbane Traders' Association. He was a supporter of the Labor Party from its infancy, but would not be tied to Party policy. In 1905 he was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council, remaining a member until the Council was abolished in 1922. He was a successful business person and sat on a number of company boards, including those of the Brisbane Tramway Company, the Queensland Board of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, Queensland Trustees, the Atlas Assurance Co., and the British Australian Cotton Association. In 1927 he was elected to the Council of the University of Queensland and served as warden of the University from 1928 to 1941. In 1935 he donated to the University to establish the TC Beirne School of Law. A devout Roman Catholic and close friend and confidant of Archbishop James Duhig (1871‚Äì1965), Beirne was a prominent benefactor of the church. In July 1929 he was awarded a papal knighthood of the Order of St Gregory the Great in recognition of his work for the Church, especially in connection with Duhig's planned Holy Name Cathedral in Fortitude Valley. On his death in 1949 The Courier-Mail commented that \\"Brisbane has lost a personality whose life has been woven strongly into its own progress and development for half a century\\". Beirne was regarded as a good employer and in erecting Bulolo Flats he appears to have had the welfare of his female employees at heart, the flats being intended for the use of girls who came from the country to work at his Fortitude Valley department store. Many of Beirne's young female employees were experiencing city life for the first time, and he took a paternal interest in their moral welfare. Located in McLachlan Street close to Brunswick Street, Bulolo was conveniently situated within easy walking distance of the main Fortitude Valley shopping centre and the TC Beirne emporium. The building accommodated eight flats, each comprising a large bed- sitting room with adjoining sleep-out balcony, a kitchenette with built-in cupboards, and tiled bathroom with built-in bath, hot water geyser and built- in cupboards. Each flat had both a private entrance and a service entrance with a trades hatch to receive deliveries (such as milk, bread, meat and vegetables). Shared laundry facilities were provided on the rooftop. The flats offered girls the privacy of a home of their own, as an alternative to shared accommodation in hostels, boarding houses, guest houses, private hotels and tenement or apartment buildings. The construction of Bulolo Flats was an indication of changing social attitudes toward the role of women in the workplace and of community expectations about the behaviour of women in society. Designed as private homes for young women earning their own income, they were symbolic of contemporary community recognition that many young, unmarried women of this era could support themselves financially and were no longer content to live in the family home, or in supervised accommodation such as hostels, or in other forms of communal dwellings. At the same time, the intention to attract only female occupants allayed traditional community suspicions about the immorality of single men and women inhabiting shared residential accommodation. By insisting that Bulolo Flats were designed for women only, the stigma of \\"fast\\" or \\"loose\\" being applied to the young unmarried female occupants was removed. Although quite fashionable in Sydney and in London, flats designed especially for single women were uncommon in Queensland, and no other self-contained block for this purpose is known to have been purpose-constructed in Brisbane in the interwar period. Sometimes referred to as \\"bachelor flats\\", they were distinguished from one-bedroom flats in that the bedroom and sitting room were combined, with a small kitchenette attached (sometimes just an alcove with a sink and single gas burner). Bachelor flats often had shared bathrooms, water closets and laundries, and were in reality tenements, not self-contained flats. For example, the only other identified, purpose-built interwar flat/tenement building in Brisbane designed expressly to accommodate single girls was St Helier, a block of six brick tenements erected in 1930 in Grey St, South Brisbane (no longer extant). Each apartment comprised a bed-sitting room with kitchenette. Bathrooms and water closets were shared ‚Äì one bath per three persons ‚Äì and there was a common laundry. In 1932 a second storey was added, comprising three tenements and an owner's flat of six rooms. Similarly, a few blocks of \\"bachelor flats\\" or tenements were erected in Brisbane for single men ‚Äì such as Donegal (1934 and 1936) on St Paul's Terrace in Fortitude Valley. Bulolo was unusual in that, although designed along the lines of \\"bachelor flats\\", the apartments were self-contained with private bathrooms and water closets. Bulolo was erected in the vanguard of the revival in Brisbane residential construction following the economic depression of the early 1930s. A chronic housing shortage in Brisbane had been exacerbated by the Depression and the collapsed of the residential construction industry. With many young couples unable to afford to purchase land and take on house repayments the demand for rental accommodation intensified, and in this environment small flat developments, both purpose-designed and house conversions, were proving attractive investments for small-scale developers. For a large enterprise such as TC Beirne (Pty) Ltd, however, the construction of Bulolo Flats was a philanthropic gesture rather than an investment opportunity, providing employment during construction and much-needed residential accommodation for young women during an accommodation shortage. Title to the site of Bulolo Flats was acquired by TC Beirne (Pty) Ltd early in 1934; in July that year Council building approval was obtained to erect a block of flats to cost and work commenced the same month. The contractor was PH Turner & Co. and the building was designed by architects Hennessy, Hennessy and Co. Hennessy, Hennessy and Co. was a Sydney-based architectural firm with branch offices in Brisbane and Melbourne. The firm had been established in Sydney in 1884 by John Francis Hennessy and Joseph I Sheerin as Hennessy and Sheerin. Both were devout Catholics and friends of Archbishop of Sydney (later Cardinal) Patrick Francis Moran, and their firm designed extensively for the Catholic Church in New South Wales. In 1912 Sheerin left the practice; his place was taken by Hennessy's son Jack Francis Hennessy, junior and the firm was renamed Hennessy and Hennessy. The Brisbane office was established in 1916 in association with Brisbane architect Francis Richard Hall (Hennessy and Hennessy and FR Hall). In 1925 Jack Donoghue was the Brisbane partner (Hennessy, Hennessy, Keesing and Co. and JP Donoghue). Leo Joseph Drinan was manager of the Brisbane office 1924‚Äì1927 and Brisbane partner/manager from 1928 to 1967. Like the Hennessys, Hall, Donoghue and Drinan were all Catholics with close connections to the Church in Queensland. Jack Francis Hennessy, junior, the principal of this firm in the interwar period, was TC Beirne's son-in-law, having married Stella Beirne in 1922. Hennessy, Hennessy and Co.'s work for the Catholic Church in Queensland included Villa Maria Convent on St Paul's Terrace, Fortitude Valley and plans for the Holy Name Cathedral, also in Fortitude Valley, which did not come to fruition. Hennessy, Hennessy and Co. were leading practitioners of mainstream interwar styles such as Spanish Mission and Romanesque and many of their buildings featured textured face brickwork, as in Bulolo Flats. The name of the flats appears to have been derived from the Bulolo goldfield in the Central Highlands of Papua New Guinea, southwest of Lae. The site of a rush in 1934 when these flats were constructed, the Bulolo field was attracting much Australian interest and investment. Bulolo Flats remained the property of TC Beirne (Pty) Ltd / TC Beirne Ltd / Duncan Street Properties (Pty) Ltd until 1955. The flats remain in single ownership and have not been strata-titled.  Description  Bulolo Flats occupies most of a narrow, slightly sloping site at the southern end of busy McLachlan Street, Fortitude Valley, on the eastern side of the street, close to the northern exit from the Story Bridge, and one allotment south of the intersection of McLachlan and Brunswick streets. It is a two-storeyed brick building comprising eight one-bedroom brick flats, four flats per floor, accessed via a central entrance from McLachlan Street. The roof is hidden behind front and side parapets. A laundry block is accommodated on the roof, at the rear. This has a flat roof behind its own parapet. On each side elevation, a centrally- positioned recess accommodates timber stairs and landings that once functioned as the service stairs, and now serve as fire- escapes only. The upper floor flats and front ground-floor flats each have a door opening onto the service stair. The two rear ground-floor flats have a back door opening to the narrow spaces along the sides of the building. At each side of the building three brick steps lead from the street to these side spaces, which once provided side access to the service door of each flat. This access is now gated. There is a brick planter box each side of the front entrance, occupying a narrow space between the front wall of the building and the street boundary. It is a well-executed building in both design and workmanship, with brickwork used for simple decorative effect in the exterior elevations. The exterior walls are of face-brick, of a flecked, mostly red- orange hue. The plinth, which is deeper at the front where the ground slopes to McLachlan Street, is of cream brick. Exterior decorative detailing ‚Äì such as to window sills, around the top of the planter boxes, and along the top of the parapet to the side and front elevations ‚Äì is in dark brown, salt-glazed brick. The front elevation to McLachlan Street is divided into three bays, delineated by simple brick pilasters which rise above the level of the parapet. In the two front side bays, on each level, former sleep-outs have been enclosed with fixed glass panels in aluminium frames. In the central bay, on the upper level, there is a fixed glass window with an aluminium frame; on the lower level a central entrance porch has been constructed over the original stairs. Above the porch is a rendered panel with the name of the building, BULOLO, in low relief \\"Art Deco\\" style lettering. The decorative detailing in the front elevation is simple but effective, and includes: the use of polychromatic brickwork in the parapet; the use of multiple brick pilasters at the corners of the building; the creation of textured effects using expressed brickwork; and the incorporation of six small \\"grotesques\\", two in each of the front bays, at about the height of the upper floor.  Heritage listing  Bulolo Flats was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 November 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Bulolo Flats, constructed in 1934, is important for its association with the provision of residential accommodation for women in Brisbane during a period of chronic, bordering on acute, housing shortage. It was one of the few residential establishments of its type constructed in Brisbane at this period, and was an attempt to address contemporary community concerns about the moral \\"evils\\" of single men and women together in other forms of shared residential accommodation of the period, such as boarding houses, guest houses, and private hotels. The place also demonstrates contemporary community recognition that modern young women were seeking an independent lifestyle outside the family home. Brisbane attracted the greatest percentage of residential flat developments in the State during the interwar years, and from late 1933 the erection of purpose-designed, purpose-built blocks of residential flats led the recovery in Brisbane residential construction following the severe and widespread economic depression of the early 1930s. Construction of Bulolo Flats in 1934 was in the vanguard of this activity. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Bulolo Flats is an uncommon Queensland example of purpose-built residential flats of the interwar period intended to accommodate single women only. Unlike some other \\"bachelor flats\\" or \\"flats for business girls\\" of this period, in which bathrooms and lavatories were shared, the Bulolo Flats, although essentially bed-sits, were self-contained, with private bathroom, water closet and kitchenette. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Bulolo Flats remains highly intact. As an excellent example of its type it is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a well-designed, well- constructed, domestic-scale block of self-contained residential flats for single women. Each small flat contains a bed-sitting room, sleep-out, kitchenette, bathroom, water closet, built-in cupboards, and front and rear (trades) entrances. Common areas include the central street entrance, halls, stairwells and the former shared laundry facilities on the rooftop. The lack of provision of garaging is consistent with its interwar purpose as flats for young women residing within easy walking distance of their place of work. Decorative details such as the planter boxes at the front, either side of the entrance stairs; the stylistic concerns with utilising brickwork for decorative purposes (including salt-glazed highlights and patterns in a darker colour brick and the incorporation of dramatic pilasters to the exterior); and the incorporation of small \\"grotesques\\" in the front elevation; remain intact. The place is an excellent example of the domestic work of the architectural firm of Hennessy, Hennessy and Co. in Queensland. The firm received a large number of commissions from the Catholic church in Queensland, and they are better known for their design work in convents, church schools, churches and presbyteries throughout the south-east of the State. In Bulolo, their concern with Romanesque stylistic influences so often found in their institutional work and of which they were leading practitioners, is apparent in their domestic design work as well. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place has a special association with TC Beirne, a prominent Queensland businessman and politician, for whom the flats were erected. It remains strong evidence of his compassion as an employer and as a committed Catholic and humanitarian, which earned him the respect of his staff and of the Queensland community generally.

It stars Sharan, Ishita Dutta, Vimala Raman and P. Ravi Shankar in the stellar roles. The film marks the reunion of director Kumaran and actor Sharan after their previous venture, Jai Lalitha. Produced by Uday K. Mehta, the film released on 6 February 2015. The core plot of the movie is based on the 1990 Malayalam movie His Highness Abdullah. http://www.kannadaprabha.com/cinema/review/kannada-film-raja-rajendra- review/246316.html Plot This story is about a guy named Mani (Sharan), who also is an imposter of a dreaded goon named Bottle Mani (P. Ravi Shankar). Due to this he earns the wrath of bottle Mani. Alternatively, Neelakanta Raju (Ramakrishna), a member of a royal family is an old man with three daughters and a long last son. He hopes that his son and his grandson come to him one day, while his sons-in-law want him to die as soon as possible. To get the old man killed, the three sons-in-law along with Shastri (Suchendra Prasad) go to city and contact a guy who promises him to send Mani to act like grandson of Neelakanta Raju. Instead of the original bottle Mani, he fixes up Mani so that Mani could get his mother cured with the contract money. Mani goes to palace and gains entry into household, but a being tender heart he fails to kill the old man, instead he saves the old man's life and gains his confidence. He also falls in love with Shastri's daughter in due course. The trio and Shastri, find out that Mani is different from Bottle Mani and try to expel him out of house. However, the spirit of Raja Rajendra who was father of Neelakanta Raju takes over Mani and teaches them lesson. Day after day, every night the spirit takes over Mani and starts expelling the enemies of family. This attracts the attention of police and Inspector Indrajith (Sadhu Kokila) comes to investigate the issue. The trio hire a black magician to seal the spirit of Raja Rajendra in a bottle and become successful. The spirit gets released when Indrajith discards the bottle by mistake. Unknowingly, Shastri's daughter requests magician to give the spirit of RR, and he gets confused as the bottles do not have any labels. He brings along spirits of a bus conductor, kabaddi player, independence activist and drama artists. What follows is the laughter riot in climax where all these spirits take over different people there and how Mani wins over the trio. Cast * Sharan as Mani and Raja Rajendra(dual role) * Ishita Dutta * Vimala Raman as Raja Rajendra's wife * Ramakrishna as Neelakanta Raju * Sadhu Kokila as Inspector Sadhu Gowda * Srinivasa Murthy as a music teacher * P. Ravi Shankar as Bottle Mani * Neenasam Ashwath * Suhas Girish * Tabla Nani * Lakshmi Siddaiah * Suchendra Prasad as Neelakanta's son-in-law * Rekha Kumar * Nurse Jayalakshmi Production Pon Kumaran who previously worked with Sharan in the comedy film Jai Lalitha had mutually agreed to do a mythological comedy film prior to the film's release. The film took off during July 2014 and quickly completed the filming process in and around Mysore and Bangalore locales. It was earlier reported that Sridhar V. Sambhram who composed music for Jai Lalitha would compose for this film as well. However, later Arjun Janya was roped in to tune the music. Television actress Ishita Dutta was roped in to play one of the lead opposite Sharan. Another popular south Indian actress Vimala Raman, who earlier acted in the blockbuster Aptharakshaka, was roped in to play the second lead. She joined the team on 15 November 2014 to shoot for her scenes. Soundtrack Arjun Janya has composed the background score and music for the film's soundtrack. Actor Sharan made his debut in singing with this film. The album consists of four tracks, the lyrics for which penned by K. Kalyan, V. Nagendra Prasad and Yogaraj Bhat. Release The film censored with 'U' certificate is all set to release on 6 February 2015. =Critical reception= \\"Desimartini\\" rated it 3/5. Sreeja Sreedharan of Desimartini described the movie as \\"Sit back, laugh it off and take notice of Sharan.The film has the perfect length and editing is crisp. Cinematography captures the mood well while the director should concentrated a little more on the wide-angle shots which sometimes look bare. This is the perfect film to enjoy your weekend and there is no doubt that Sharan has a new hit on his hands. P Kumar has managed to get together a simple story and transform it into wholesome entertainment. He wins as the story writer and director. \\" References External links  'Raja Rajendra' CD comes Category:2015 films Category:Kannada-language films Category:Indian films Category:Indian comedy films Category:2015 comedy films Category:2010s Kannada-language films Category:Films scored by Arjun Janya Category:Films directed by Pon Kumaran ","title":"Raja Rajendra"},{"id":"45255950","text":"After the Morning is the debut release by American pianist John Hicks recorded in 1979 and released on the West 54 label.John Hicks discography accessed January 29, 2015 Two earlier sessions led by Hicks were released on Strata- East Records following this album.

Early detection and accurate diagnosis is essential for the effective management of plant disease. Thus the first step in studying any disease is its timely detection of the diseased plant. Quick initial detection is largely based on the signs and symptoms of disease. Signs are the visible physical presence of either the pathogen itself or the structures formed by the pathogen. Common examples of easily detected signs are those such as the fungal mycelia and spore masses of downy mildews observed on infected leaves and the bacterial ooze of Xanthomonas leaf streak disease on rice. Symptoms are the visible changes that occur in the host plant in response to infection by pathogens. For any disease in a given plant, there is the characteristic expression of symptoms, usually occurring in a sequential series during the course of the disease. This series of symptoms depicting the disease picture is referred to as the disease syndrome. Morphological symptoms may be exhibited by the entire plant or by any organ of the plant. These have been categorized into different groups for easy of study. Primarily, morphological symptoms of plant diseases can be categorized into 6 different types. * Necroses * Growth abnormalities * Metaplastic symptoms * Proleptic symptoms * Color changes * Wilts Necroses Necroses are caused due to necrosis or death of plant cells. The affected plant tissue usually turns brown to black in color. Necrotic symptoms could appear in any part of the plant such as in storage organs, in green tissues, or in woody tissues. =Necrosis in storage organs= Death of cells in storage organs terminates in decomposition or decay referred to as a rot. Two types of rots are identified as Dry rot and Wet rot on storage tissues. Soft rots are those where the pathogen breaks down the host cell walls, resulting in the exudation of juices from the infected tissue. The organ becomes mushy or pulpy and a foul smell often develops due to colonization by secondary invaders. Many fungi and bacteria cause soft rots on several fruits and vegetables. Species of the fungus, Rhizopus and bacterium Erwinia are two such commonly found pathogens causing soft rots. In a dry rot, the storage organ becomes hard and dry, and in some diseases, there is rapid loss of water and the infected organs become shriveled, wrinkled, and leathery. Dry rots showing such symptoms are referred to as mummifications. =Necrosis in green tissues= Necroses on green tissue are termed differently based on the nature of symptoms and the type of green tissue. The term, damping off refers to the sudden wilting and topping over of seedlings as a result of extensive necrosis of tender tissue of the roots and stem near the soil line, due to the attack of soil-borne pathogens such as fungus, Pythium. This fungus is known to cause damping off in an assortment of seedlings such as that of brinjal, chilli, mung beans, tobacco, tomato, and Cucurbita. A spot refers to a well-defined area of gray or brown necrotic tissue. Spots are very common on leaves and fruits and are probably the most familiar necrotic symptom. Sometimes the necrotic tissue within a leaf spot may crack and fall off from the surrounding green tissue leaving an empty space. Such a symptom is known as a shot hole. Minute or very small spots are sometimes referred to as flecks or specks. When dark mycelia of a fungal pathogen appear on the surface of necrotic spot, blotting the leaves, shoots, an stems as large and irregular spots, the symptom is referred to as a blotch. Both streaks and stripes occur in grasses and are elongated areas having dead cells. Streaks occur along the stem and veins, while stripes are in the laminar tissues between veins. Net necrosis is a symptom resulting from an irregular pattern of anastomoses between streaks or stripes. Blights are characterized by the rapid death of entire leaves including the veins or parts of the leaves. Blights also could occur on flowers and stems. Scorches resemble blights, but there necrosis occurs in irregular patterns between veins and along leaf margins. Firing is sudden drying, collapse and death of entire leaves. Firing occurs in response to the activity of root rot and vascular wilt pathogens. Scald is the blanching of epidermal and adjacent tissues of fruits and occasionally of leaves. The sudden death of unopened buds or inflorescence is referred to as blast. Extensive necrosis of fruits that resemble in premature dropping is called shelling. =Necrosis in woody tissues= Necrosis of woody tissue often brings about various types of die-back symptoms. Dieback is the extensive necrosis of a shoot from its tip downwards. Restricted necrosis of the bark and cortical tissue of stems and roots is termed as a canker. In cankers, necrotic tissue in the sunken lesions is sharply limited, usually by a callus from adjacent healthy tissue. When woody tissues are diseased, they may exude different kinds of substances. When the exudate is gummy, the symptom is called gummosis, while it is resinosis when it is resinous. If the exudate is neither gummy nor resinous, it is described as bleeding. Abnormalities in growth Many disease symptoms are associated with growth changes in diseased plants. These could be caused by either reduced growth due to hypoplasia and atrophy or excessive growth due to hyperplasia and hypertrophy. =Hypoplasia and atrophy= Hypoplasia is the failure of plants or plant organs to develop fully due to a decreased production of the number of cells. Hypoplasia results in plants or plant parts of sub-normal size.http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/280003/hypoplastic-symptom Atrophy is the reduction in the size of plant cells produced. This also results in stunted plants or plant parts. Dwarfing is the failure of a plant or a plant part to attain its full size. Rosetting is a condition where the internode of a plant do not elongate, and hence, the leaves appear close together in a cluster. =Hyperplasia and hypertrophy= Hyperplasia is the enlargement of a plant tissue due to excessive increase in the number of plant cells produced. Hyperplasia results in overdevelopment in size of plants or plant organs.http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/279676/hyperplastic- symptom Hypertrophy is excessive growth due to the enlargement of individual cells. This condition also results in the overdevelopment in size of plants or plant organs. Hyperplasia and hypertrophy could result in the enlargement of leaves and fruits, and the enlargement of stems and roots. Enlargement of leaves and fruits Several symptoms expressing enlargement of leaves and fruits are commonly observed among diseased plants. Curling, which is the bending of the shoot or the rolling of the leaf, is a result of over-growth on one side of an organ. Often viral diseases cause such leaf distortions due to irregular growth of the lamina. Leaf curl of papaya is caused by papaya leaf curl virus (a begomovirus). Extreme reduction of the leaf lamina brings about the symptom known as the Shoe-string effect. The puckering or crinkling of leaves due to different growth rates in adjacent tissue is known as savoying. Overgrowth of epidermal and underlying tissues of leaves, stems, fruits and tubers may result scab formation. Scab consists of raised, rough, and discrete lesions. These are often sunken and cracked, giving a typical scabby appearance. Localized swellings or enlargement of epidermal cells due to excessive accumulation of water or fungal structures is termed intermuscence and the diagnostic symptom is the appearance of a blister. Enlargement of stems and roots Symptoms causing enlargement of stems and roots are termed differently based on their nature. Excessive accumulation of food material in stems, above a constricted area produces a swelling termed sarcody. Localized swellings that involve entire organs are termed tumefaction. Commonly exhibited tumefactions are galls, clubs, and knots. Excessive development of adventitious organs results in fasciculation, that is the clustering of organs around a focal point. Such examples include witch's broom and hairy root. Witch's broom is a broom-like mass proliferation due to the dense clustering of branches of woody plants while hairy root results due to excessive development of roots. Fasciation is the broadening or flattening of cylindrical organs such as stems. The continued development of any organ after it has reached a stage beyond which it normally does not grow is known as proliferation. The outgrowth of tissue in response to wounding is known as a callus. Callus formation is found to form around most cankers. Metaplastic symptoms Metaplastic symptoms are those which form when tissues change from one form to another. Such symptoms include phyllody, the development of floral organs into leaf-like structures, juvenillody, the development of juvenile seedlings on mature plants and russeting, a superficial browning of surfaces of fruits and tubers due to suberization. Proleptic symptoms Proleptic symptoms result from the development of tissues earlier than usual. Examples include prolepsis, the premature development of a shoot from a bud, proleptic abscission, the premature formation of abscission layers and restoration, the unexpected development of organs that are normally rudimentary. Color changes Changes in the color of plant tissue are a common symptom of plant disease. Often these color changes are brought about by the yellowing of normal green tissue due to the destruction of chlorophyll or a failure to form chlorophyll. Such repression of leaf color may be complete or partial. When color repression is complete, it is known as albication. However, the more common, partial repression is referred to as chlorosis. Patches of green tissue alternating with chlorotic areas are described as a mosaic. Mosaic is a symptom caused by many viruses. Based on the intensity and the pattern of discoloration, mosaics are termed differently. Irregular patches of distinct light and dark areas are known as mottling. Streaking and ring spots are still other distinct types of discolorations. Ring spots are circular masses of chlorosis with a green center. Vein clearing and vein banding are yet other common color changes on leaves. Chlorophyll may also develop in tissues normally devoid of it. Thus usually white or colored tissue becomes green in color. This is called as virescence. Anthocyanescence is due to the overdevelopment of anthocyanin and result in the development of a purplish coloration. Color changes can also take place in flowers. Such an example is the color break virus-affected tulips.http://www.hawaiiplantdisease.net/glossary/Anthocyanescence.htm Wilts Wilting is due to loss of turgor in plant tissue resulting in the dropping of plant parts. They are common symptom in diseases where the pathogen or the toxic metabolites it produces affects the vascular tissue of the host plant. Interference in water transport brought about by the infection of these vascular pathogens leads to wilting. Unlike wilting due to low soil moisture, wilting due to the activity of these pathogens cannot be overcome by watering the plants. Infected plants eventually die.http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/644850/wilt  See also  * Plant pathology * American Phytopathological Society * Australasian Plant Pathology Society * Biological control with micro-organisms * British Society for Plant Pathology * Burl * Common names of plant diseases * Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables * Forest pathology * Fungicides * Gene-for- gene relationship * Global Plant Clinic * Glossary of phytopathology * Herbivory * Inducible plant defenses against herbivory * List of phytopathology journals * Microbial inoculant * Mycology * Pesticide * Phytoplasma * Plant defense against herbivory * Plant disease forecasting * QoI * Strobilurins * Stunt References  External links  * International Society for Plant Pathology * Australasian Plant Pathology Society * American Phytopathological Society * British Society for Plant Pathology * Food Security Journal * Contributions toward a bibliography of peach yellows, 1887‚Äì1888 Digital copy of scientist Erwin Frink Smith's manuscript on peach yellows disease. * Erwin Frink Smith Papers Index to papers of Smith (1854‚Äì1927) who was considered the \\"father of bacterial plant pathology\\" and worked for the United States Department of Agriculture for over 40 years. * Plant Health Progress, Online journal of applied plant pathology * Pacific Northwest Fungi, online mycology journal with papers on fungal plant pathogens * Rothamsted Plant Pathology and Microbiology Department * New Mexico State University Department of Entomology Plant Pathology and Weed Science * Pathogen Host Interactions Database (PHI-base) * Grape Virology Category:Agronomy Category:Pathology ","title":"Morphological symptoms of plant diseases"},{"id":"45255990","text":"Bluefin Robotics is an American robotics company, headquartered in Quincy, Massachusetts, which specialises in the design and manufacture of military and civilian autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and related technology. The company was founded in 1997, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Battelle Memorial Institute in 2005. Its products include the Bluefin-21 underwater search robot and its military derivative, the Knifefish minesweeping AUV, which entered service with the United States Navy in 2017. Bluefin was involved in the development of several advanced Navy projects, including the Black Pearl AUV and the Proteus optionally-manned submersible. Company history and overview Bluefin Robotics was founded in 1997 by Dr James Bellingham and Frank van Mierlo, both engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr Bellingham was the manager of the MIT AUV laboratory. Frank van Mierlo was the CEO of Bluefin from 1997 until August 2005. At the outset the company had a contract from ONR to build the BPAUV and an order from Racal to build two deep-water survey vehicles. Both contracts were completed successfully. In the first eight years of its existence Bluefin was always profitable and each year grew by double digits. In many ways Bluefin started the AUV industry. Jim Bellingham was the first person to build a small AUV at MIT (the Seasquirt vehicle). Bluefin Robotics was the first independent AUV company in the world and the original employees of the company went on and started twelve other ventures many of which were in the Marine robotics industry. In 2005, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Battelle Memorial Institute, an Ohio-based nonprofit research and development company. In 2010, Bluefin Robotics won a gold award at the 7th Annual Team Massachusetts Economic Impact Awards, and in 2013 it received accolades from R&D; Magazine and the Robotics Business Review. In April 2014, it received a US$7.11 million federal contract from the US Navy's Office of Naval Research for the development of the Navy's experimental Black Pearl AUV. , Bluefin Robotics employs around 200 people. The company is a member of several business and technology associations, including the Marine Technology Society (MTS), the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), the Mine Warfare Association (MINWARA), the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) and the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council (MassTLC).

Description A male Everglades pygmy sunfish. The photographer notes that it \\"turned very pale in the photo box\\" The fish can grow to a maximum length of 3.4 cm (in total length), and it generally grows to 2.3 cm (TL). Scales are present at the top of its head. Its mouth is both small and oblique. The fish does not have a lateral line. A crescent-shaped area behind each eye may be gold or iridescent blue. It has dark lips. Egg count in the ovaries of females in captivity ranged from 115 to 500, increasing with the fish's size. The fish has variable color and form. Its body is generally colored brown with darker spots. The fish has several rows of dark red spots on its dorsal and anal fins. \\"Nonbreeding\\" fish may have light streaks, mottling, or blotches. Females of the species in general are colored brown on their backs with mottled brown and cream/white coloring underneath, or they may be reddish brown. The females have no markings. \\"Breeding\\" males are colored black with iridescent blue spots. Males have black fins with or without brown spots. Male bodies may be black, brown, or dark green with blotches or spots. A few indistinct dark bars may be present on the male body. Males may have brassy or blue-green iridescent scales scattered across their bodies. According to one source, males are dark black and have iridescent blue flecks, and females have a brown coloration. Distribution and habitat The Everyglades pygmy sunfish can be found in the United States from the end of Cape Fear River, North Carolina to Mobile Bay, Alabama. It may also be found from the south of Florida to the northern end of the Everglades. The fish has been found more often in the natural marshes rather than the constructed marshes of central Florida. The fish lives in freshwater and demersal habitats at a pH range of 7.0 to 7.5 and a temperature range of 10 to 30 degrees Celsius. They reside in swamps, sphagnum bogs, sloughs with heavy vegetation, canals, overflow pools, ponds, lakes, and streams; generally over mud, silt, sand, limestone, or detritus. They exist in such areas where the current is slow and water levels fluctuate. They prefer shallow areas as well as areas of vegetation. The species tends to stay restricted to black water environments more than other species of the genus. The species' population density is highly dependent on environmental conditions. However, the fish is considered common in most of its range and its overall population (estimated at 100,000 as of 2013) is large and stable. Behavior The Everglades pygmy sunfish tends to live alone. As an invertivore, the fish preys on worms and other crustaceans in its habitat. Prey include cladocerans, dipteran larvae, annelids, chironomids, copepods, ostracods, and newly hatched snails. Where food is centrally located, males will establish territories with closer proximity to the center based on dominance. In environments of evenly distributed food, males will range freely and will not establish territories. Like many other fish species, Elassoma evergladei is oviparous. A female may lay 40 to 60 eggs, and a male will guard the eggs. Eggs are laid in aquatic plants, especially in those from the genus Ceratophyllum. =In captivity= In captivity, males will establish their territory in feeding areas. Human significance The fish is sold commercially for aquariums. One author considers it \\"the best-known member of the group [pygmy sunfishes] in the aquarium hobby.\\" In 2013, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species named the species Least Concern because of its \\"large extent of occurrence, large number of subpopulations, large population size, apparently stable trend, and lack of major threats.\\" Etymology, taxonomy, and history Elassoma refers to the Greek words elasson, for \\"smaller\\", and soma, for \\"body\\". Evergladei means \\"of the Everglades\\", named for the location the type specimens were captured. David Starr Jordan first described the species in 1884, and his original specimens measured one inch in length. One 1918 publication mentioned the species' common name as the \\"southern pygmy sunfish\\".

It is a member of the DnaQ family of exonucleases and non-processively acts on the 3' end of single-stranded nucleic acids. RNase T is capable of cleaving both DNA and RNA, with extreme sequence specificity discriminating against cytosine at the 3' end of the substrate.  Structure and mechanism  RNAse T catalyzes the removal of nucleotides from the 3' end of both RNA and DNA. It is inhibited by both double stranded DNA and RNA, as well as cytosine residues on the 3' end of RNA. Two cytosines at the 3' end of RNA appear to remove the activity of RNAse T entirely. This cytosine effect, however, is observed less with ssDNA. This lack of sequence specificity in ssDNA, combined with its ability to act on ssDNA close to a duplex region, has led to its use in creating blunt ends for DNA cloning. Structurally, RNAse T exists as an anti-parallel dimer and requires a divalent cation to function. center RNAse T is able to achieve its sequence specificity in RNA digestion via several aromatic residues that sandwich between nucleobases. The œÄ-œÄ interactions between four phenylalanine residues and the two nucleotides at the 3' end are different depending on the identify of the nucleotides, which changes the conformation and thus activity of the enzyme. An additional glutamic acid residue rotates to hydrogen bond to cytosine by not other bases, further increasing specificity.  Function  A member of the larger DEDD family of exoribonucleases, RNAse T plays a key role in the maturation of tRNA as well as the maturation of the 5S and 23S rRNA domains. Specifically, RNAse T cleaves the 3' AMP residue from the 3' CCA sequences at the end of tRNA, which explains RNAse T's sequence specificity for stopping at the 3' CC sequence. Additionally, RNAse T can play a role in DNA repair by cleaving the 3' end of bulge DNA. While E. coli can survive without RNAse T, its absence leads to slower life cycles and weakened response to starvation. Additionally, the presence of RNAse T in E. coli is linked to increased resistance to UV damage. It has been theorized that, while other ribonculeases can perform the function RNAse T, the fact that RNAse T is more effective at cleaving DNA and RNA near double-stranded regions means that alternatives are less effective. Despite the apparent usefulness of RNAse T, the enzyme is only found in gammaproteobacteria. In E. coli, RNAse T is encoded by the rnt gene and is hypothesized to have diverged from the proofreading subunits of polymerase III during the emergence of gammaproteobacteria.

History From May 1915 to July 1916, the mountain and its surroundings was the location of fierce fighting between Italian and German, later Austrio-Hungarian, troops, as part of the Italian front in World War I. Climbing Most climbs start from the north, where the mountain is a relatively easy hike, or the west face, where the summit can be reached by a via ferrata. The south face, however, is a much more difficult challenge, with many of the routes being either fifth or sixth graded climbs.

The film was dubbed into Telugu as Trisha Leda Nayanthara.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIcvsjBYkJ0  Plot  While travelling by train, Jeeva (G. V. Prakash Kumar) tells the ticket collector why he left his home and is travelling to Kumbakonam. When Jeeva was born, he was born together with two other girls - Aditi (Manisha Yadav) and Ramya (Anandhi) - due to the shortage of room in the hospital. Jeeva is close to his uncle Vishu (VTV Ganesh) and asks for his advice every time he has problems with girls. The three of them grew up together since a young age. When they are studying together in higher secondary, Aditi leaves to Bangalore for a week. During this time, Ramya and Jeeva fall in love. Jeeva is afraid about proposing to Ramya, whereas Ramya proposes to Jeeva, and he accepts. That night, Ramya visits Jeeva, and both romance while roaming around the city. The next day, Jeeva reveals to his friend accidentally about his make out session with Ramya. It starts to spread around the school, and Ramya gets so angry with Jeeva that she dumps him. She leaves Chennai to forget him. As she is leaving, Aditi calls Jeeva and proposes her love to Jeeva on the phone, which Jeeva accepts. Their relationship is going well for almost three years. One day, Jeeva finds out that Aditi was drinking and forces her into giving up drinking as he hates girls drinking. She promises to stop drinking, but once again, he sees Aditi drinking in a club. He becomes so angry that he scolds her in front of everyone, gets heartbroken, and behaves so wildly that he is forcibly taken away from there. Jeeva tells this story to the ticket collector and finally reaches Kumbakonam, where Vishu was living. At the railway station, Vishu receives Jeeva. Jeeva asks Vishu for advice, for which he says that if one girl leaves, there is always another one. Jeeva then sees Ramya there and falls for her again. He goes after her, but she chases him off again because of what happened in school. There, Vishu tells him to get into contact with Ramya's aunt Simran (Simran). He then tries to make Ramya fall in love again with the help of Simran, doubting whether he can succeed or not. Jeeva gets close to Simran, and with her help, he finally successfully woos Ramya again. When they are about to be united, he asks Ramya five questions as he did not know what happened to her these three years when he was not with her. The final question turns out to be whether Ramya is a virgin or not (as Ramya had a breakup recently). Initially, Ramya gets angry by that question but finally confesses that she is not a virgin as she had sex with her ex-lover Harish (Arya). On hearing this, Jeeva gets angry and immediately asks Ramya to call Harish. Harish arrives at the scene and tries to convince Jeeva that they had sex only once, but Jeeva becomes more angry cursing that the curse of virgin boys will not leave these kind of girls and leaves that place immediately. Ramya and Harish unite once again. Jeeva, feeling disgusted, plans to leave Kumbakonam and go back to Chennai. He tells Vishu that he wants only a virgin girl, but his uncle scolds him by saying that nowadays, virgin girls are really hard to find, but Jeeva sticks with his policy and leaves for the train, which has started moving. He tries to catch the train and sees one hand extended from a train compartment to help him board inside. That is Priya (Priya Anand). Jeeva thanks Priya and sits beside her in the train, trying to flirt with her by asking about her whereabouts, in which she replies Trichy, and he decides to follow, which symbolizes the audience that Jeeva is on a new mission trying to woo Priya. The film ends with him saying \\"Trisha Illana Nayanthara\\" (if not Trisha, then Nayanthara).  Cast  *G. V.

Origin After the defeat of the short lived Xueyantuo khanate, Sir people escaped to west. In 679-681 term they supported Turkic revolt against the Tang Empire in China. After the Turkic Empire was restored they took part in the formation of the new empire. Uyghur Khaganate Uyghurs, who replaced the Second Turkic Khaganate possibly mentioned the K√Øvchak, instead of Sir, as the tribe who accompanied the Turks in their Moyun Chur monument. Thus it seems that the names Sir and K√Øvchak were used interchangeably and K√Øvchak was the name Sir people assumed after the collapse of the Turkic Empire. Klyashtorny proposed that the new name K√Øvchak means \\"unfortunate\\" in Old Turkic language, probably referring to the problems they encountered after the collapse of the empire. K√Øvchak remnants escaped to west to Kimek territory. The Kipchak people of the later era likely descended from the K√Øvchak of the 8th century.

The film is a remake of the 1975 film, Disciples of Shaolin, which was directed by Chang Cheh. Plot After the death of his father, the poor and illiterate Kwan Fung-yiu (Aaron Kwok) goes out to the provincial capital to seek refuge from Tuen Ching-wan (Ti Lung), a friend of his deceased father, and works in a dye factory, the \\"Four Seasons Weaver\\". The political situation in the capital is tense. With his superior identity as a Manchurian, Hak Wo-po (Kenneth Tsang), owner of the \\"Tin Lung Spinner\\", dominates the city and set up a gambling den where he sends his workers to fight with workers of \\"Four Seasons Weave\\". The newly appointed magistrate Yuen Tin-yau (Cheung Siu-fai) and his instructor Mr. Wah (Paul Chun) want to eradicate Hak, but they do not have enough evidence to bring him to justice. Later, Tin-yau meets Pak Siu-kwan (Maggie Cheung), the owner of \\"Four Seasons Weaver\\" and Wah's daughter Lin (Jacklyn Wu). Then it was revealed that Tuen was a fugitive who changed his name and hid in the dye factory to avoid arrest and developed affection towards Pak. Fung-yiu and Lin also develops a mutual bond after an incident. \\"Tin Lung Spinners\\" had always been inferior to \\"Four Seasons Weaver\\". Feeling vengeful, Hak sets \\"Four Seasons Weave\\" on fire to vent his anger. Fung-yiu, who is witless, dazed and confused, gets up to the fighting arena, and was lured by Hak where he kills his friend's father. Fung-yiu had fallen further and further into a quagmire of confusion. He also reveals Tuen's past identity as a killer and Tuen is wanted by officials. Yuen Tin-yau's discerning eyes can tell greatness from Fung-yiu, and they work together to defeat the \\"Dragon Place\\". However, Tuen was ambushed by Hak where he swallowed poison and shot to death by millions of arrows. Fung-yiu hurried off to save Tuen, but it was too late by then.

The band was formed in 2011 in Hamburg.  History  J√∂rn Schubert (Dark Age) always wanted to combine heavy metal music with classical music. For this purpose, he sought suitable musicians, eventually finding the soprano Nina Jiers and the baritone Thorsten Schuck. At that time, Jiers had no experience with metal. Mirko Gluschke (Dead End Circle), who is a good friend of Schubert, became the growling vocalist. Dirk Schl√§chter (Gamma Ray) became the band's bass guitarist. In addition, during the recording of the demo, Corvin Bahn (ex-(?)Gamma Ray), Andr√© Schumann (Dark Age) and Guiomar Espineira (flautist) helped, in order to release the first demo (\\"Destined Ways'\\") in mid-2011, in collaboration with the producer Elke Freese (Dark Age, Hammer Studios). On 29 May 2012, Schubert signed a contract with the record company earMUSIC which asked him to record an entire album. The recordings for the album Destined Ways began in June 2012 and were finished in November 2012. It was released in Germany on 29 August 2014 and internationally on 18 July 2014. The two year time gap between the completion of the album and its release was explained by the search for a suitable sample space and new members. Schumann and Espineira were only intended in the studio recordings and Bahn was not available at that time for live performances. Therefore, the band searched for new live musicians. Eventually, Mikis Trimborn (Syndemic) became the second guitarist, while Thorsten Harnitz (Counter-World Experience, Crystal Breed) became the drummer. On 1 August 2014, Neopera made their second appearance at Wacken Open Air Liveshow.

The ground, which has staged \`A' internationals and U19 matches, now looks set for a major period of development. History The first cricket in Matara dates back to 28 December 1884 when a Combined Ceylonese Cricket Club played against Matara CC. There was no Matara Cricket Club during this period and the team was made up of a collection of cricketers who played against visiting teams from the other parts of the island. The Matara Cricket Club was actually established in 1904, with the bulk of the side being European tea planters. In the early part of the century the ground did not have a pavilion with the players using a shed, which had been erected for the annual Race Meet. In 1966 the then President of the Matara Sports Club, Edmund Samarasekera, who continued for 21 years in the position, played a major role in developing the venue. A new pavilion was constructed and contributions from various cricket enthusiasts assisted in completing the building. The first international side to play in Matara was the Pakistan U23 team in 1973. Former internationals, Pramodya Wickremasinghe and Sanath Jayasuriya both come from Matara.

He is currently signed to WWE where he serves as the play-by-play commentator on Raw. Phillips served as the play-by-play commentator on NXT from 2014 to 2017, SmackDown Live from 2017 to 2019 and on 205 Live and NXT UK from 2019 to 2020.  Career  = Early broadcasting career = Hannifan's first broadcasting experience was as a public address announcer for a football game in his sophomore year of high school, where he also played backgammon and track and field. It was then he immediately knew he wanted to be in sports broadcasting. His quest to perfect his craft took him to Penn State Altoona and then Penn State main campus, majoring in broadcast journalism with an emphasis on sports broadcasting. During his time in Happy Valley, Hannifan was actively involved in COMRadio, the student-run radio station at Penn State. After working with Big Ten Network's Student U branch and graduating from Penn State, Hannifan did play-by-play for Juniata College's football and basketball teams in central Pennsylvania for $50 a game. While doing that in the summer of 2012, he was waiting tables to stay afloat financially. After a year and a half out of school, Hannifan was wondering if broadcasting was a right fit for him, when he received a job offer from WWE. = WWE (2012‚Äìpresent) = Hannifan conducted backstage interviews for the WWE App on Raw and was the lead announcer on Superstars, Main Event and SmackDown, flanked by color commentators Jerry Lawler and Byron Saxton, until he was replaced by NXT's play-by-play commentator Rich Brennan on the August 27, 2015 episode of SmackDown. He also served as the Social Media Lounge host on all WWE pay-per- view pre-shows, until Fastlane (2017) when Charly Caruso took the Social Media Lounge, and also conducts backstage interviews for WWE.com. Hannifan, as Tom Philips, serves as lead play-by-play announcer for SmackDown Live commentary team. After winning the United States Championship against Kevin Owens at Payback, Chris Jericho put both Philips and RAW reporter Mike Rome on The List for both interrupting his goodbye to RAW general manager Kurt Angle. He was the lead commentator for the NXT brand tapings and broadcasts since 2014 until being replaced by Mauro Ranallo in 2017. Phillips also acted as lead play-by- play announcer at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, 2017 for the SmackDown brand, becoming the fifth person in the company's history to act as the lead commentator at WrestleMania. Philips also led commentating in 205 Live before Vic Joseph replaced him. Phillips filled in for Cole on the October 2, 2017 Raw so that Cole could attend the wedding of his son. On October 5, 2019, WWE announced that a new commentary team will be on NXT UK. On November 1, 2019, due to significant flight delays, Phillips filled in on commentary for Michael Cole and Corey Graves on SmackDown with other substitute announcers Renee Young, Aiden English on first hour and Pat McAfee on second hour. Phillips also acted as lead play-by-play announcer at Royal Rumble on January 26, 2020 for the Raw brand, then the next day, Phillips announced that he returns for his new play-on-play commentator role on Raw, replacing Vic Joseph joining the Raw commentary team alongside Jerry Lawler and Byron Saxton. On March 12, 2020, Phillips left the announce team on NXT UK.  Other media  Hannifan was also the host of one of WWE's most popular YouTube series, 5 Things, until October 21, 2015, when Kyle Edwards replaced him. Phillips resumed the position in 2016 after Edwards was released from WWE.

A semi-simple object is one that can be decomposed into a sum of simple objects, and simple objects are those that do not contain non- trivial proper sub-objects. The precise definitions of these words depends on the context. For example, if G is a finite group, then a nontrivial finite- dimensional representation V over a field is said to be simple if the only subrepresentations it contains are either {0} or V (these are also called irreducible representations). Now Maschke's theorem says that any finite- dimensional representation of a finite group is a direct sum of simple representations (provided the characteristic of the base field does not divide the order of the group). So in the case of finite groups with this condition, every finite-dimensional representation is semi-simple. Especially in algebra and representation theory, \\"semi-simplicity\\" is also called complete reducibility. For example, Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility says a finite-dimensional representation of a semisimple compact Lie group is semisimple. A square matrix (in other words a linear operator T:V \\\\to V with V finite dimensional vector space) is said to be simple if its only invariant subspaces under T are {0} and V. If the field is algebraically closed (such as the complex numbers), then the only simple matrices are of size 1 by 1. A semi-simple matrix is one that is similar to a direct sum of simple matrices; if the field is algebraically closed, this is the same as being diagonalizable. These notions of semi-simplicity can be unified using the language of semi-simple modules, and generalized to semi-simple categories. Introductory example of vector spaces If one considers all vector spaces (over a field, such as the real numbers), the simple vector spaces are those that contain no proper subspaces. Therefore, the one-dimensional vector spaces are the simple ones. So it is a basic result of linear algebra that any finite-dimensional vector space is the direct sum of simple vector spaces; in other words, all finite-dimensional vector spaces are semi-simple. Semi- simple matrices A matrix or, equivalently, a linear operator T on a finite- dimensional vector space V is called semi-simple if every T-invariant subspace has a complementary T-invariant subspace.Lam (2001), [ p. 39] This is equivalent to the minimal polynomial of T being square-free. For vector spaces over an algebraically closed field F, semi-simplicity of a matrix is equivalent to diagonalizability. This is because such an operator always has an eigenvector; if it is, in addition, semi-simple, then it has a complementary invariant hyperplane, which itself has an eigenvector, and thus by induction is diagonalizable. Conversely, diagonalizable operators are easily seen to be semi-simple, as invariant subspaces are direct sums of eigenspaces, and any basis for this space can be extended to an eigenbasis. Semi-simple modules and rings For a fixed ring R, a nontrivial R-module M is simple, if it has no submodules other than 0 and M. An R-module M is semi- simple if every R-submodule of M is an R-module direct summand of M (the trivial module 0 is semi-simple, but not simple). For an R-module M, M is semi-simple if and only if it is the direct sum of simple modules (the trivial module is the empty direct sum). Finally, R is called a semi-simple ring if it is semi-simple as an R-module. As it turns out, this is equivalent to requiring that any finitely generated R-module M is semi-simple.* Examples of semi-simple rings include fields and, more generally, finite direct products of fields. For a finite group G Maschke's theorem asserts that the group ring R[G] over some ring R is semi-simple if and only if R is semi-simple and G is invertible in R. Since the theory of modules of R[G] is the same as the representation theory of G on R-modules, this fact is an important dichotomy, which causes modular representation theory, i.e., the case when G does divide the characteristic of R to be more difficult than the case when G does not divide the characteristic, in particular if R is a field of characteristic zero. By the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem, a unital Artinian ring R is semisimple if and only if it is (isomorphic to) M_{n_1}(D_1) \\\\times M_{n_2}(D_2) \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times M_{n_r}(D_r), where each D_i is a division ring and M_n(D) is the ring of n-by-n matrices with entries in D. An operator T is semi-simple in the sense above if and only if the subalgebra F[T] \\\\subset \\\\operatorname{End}_F(V) generated by the powers (i.e., iterations) of T inside the ring of endomorphisms of V is semi-simple. As indicated above, the theory of semi-simple rings is much more easy than the one of general rings. For example, any short exact sequence :0 \\\\to M' \\\\to M \\\\to M \\\\to 0 of modules over a semi-simple ring must split, i.e., M \\\\cong M' \\\\oplus M. From the point of view of homological algebra, this means that there are no non-trivial extensions. The ring Z of integers is not semi-simple: Z is not the direct sum of nZ and Z/n. Semi-simple categories Many of the above notions of semi- simplicity are recovered by the concept of a semi-simple category C. Briefly, a category is a collection of objects and maps between such objects, the idea being that the maps between the objects preserve some structure inherent in these objects. For example, R-modules and R-linear maps between them form a category, for any ring R. An abelian categoryMore generally, the same definition of semi-simplicity works for pseudo-abelian additive categories. See for example Yves Andr√©, Bruno Kahn: Nilpotence, radicaux et structures mono√Ødales. With an appendix by Peter O'Sullivan. Rend. Sem. Mat. Univ. Padova 108 (2002), 107‚Äì291. https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0203273. C is called semi- simple if there is a collection of simple objects X_\\\\alpha \\\\in C, i.e., ones with no subobject other than the zero object 0 and X_\\\\alpha itself, such that any object X is the direct sum (i.e., coproduct or, equivalently, product) of finitely many simple objects. It follows from Schur's lemma that the endomorphism ring :\\\\operatorname{End}_C(X)=\\\\operatorname{Hom}_C(X, X) in a semi-simple category is a product of matrix rings over division rings, i.e., semi-simple. Moreover, a ring R is semi-simple if and only if the category of finitely generated R-modules is semisimple. An example from Hodge theory is the category of polarizable pure Hodge structures, i.e., pure Hodge structures equipped with a suitable positive definite bilinear form. The presence of this so-called polarization causes the category of polarizable Hodge structures to be semi-simple.Peters, Chris A. M.; Steenbrink, Joseph H. M. Mixed Hodge structures. Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete. 3. Folge. A Series of Modern Surveys in Mathematics [Results in Mathematics and Related Areas. 3rd Series. A Series of Modern Surveys in Mathematics], 52. Springer- Verlag, Berlin, 2008. xiv+470 pp. ; see Corollary 2.12 Another example from algebraic geometry is the category of pure motives of smooth projective varieties over a field k \\\\operatorname{Mot}(k)_\\\\sim modulo an adequate equivalence relation \\\\sim. As was conjectured by Grothendieck and shown by Jannsen, this category is semi-simple if and only if the equivalence relation is numerical equivalence.Uwe Jannsen: Motives, numerical equivalence, and semi-simplicity, Invent. math. 107, 447~452 (1992) This fact is a conceptual cornerstone in the theory of motives. Semisimple abelian categories also arise from a combination of a t-structure and a (suitably related) weight structure on a triangulated category.  Semi-simplicity in representation theory  One can ask whether the category of finite-dimensional representations of a group or a Lie algebra is semisimple, that is, whether every finite-dimensional representation decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations. The answer, in general, is no. For example, the representation of \\\\mathbb{R} given by :\\\\Pi(x)=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & x\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} is not a direct sum of irreducibles. Example 4.25 (There is precisely one nontrivial invariant subspace, the span of the first basis element, e_1.) On the other hand, if G is compact, then every finite-dimensional representation \\\\Pi of G admits an inner product with respect to which \\\\Pi is unitary, showing that \\\\Pi decomposes as a sum of irreducibles. Theorem 4.28 Similarly, if \\\\mathfrak{g} is a complex semisimple Lie algebra, every finite-dimensional representation of \\\\mathfrak{g} is a sum of irreducibles. Theorem 10.9 Weyl's original proof of this used the unitarian trick: Every such \\\\mathfrak{g} is the complexification of the Lie algebra of a simply connected compact Lie group K. Since K is simply connected, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the finite-dimensional representations of K and of \\\\mathfrak{g}. Theorem 5.6 Thus, the just-mentioned result about representations of compact groups applies. It is also possible to prove semisimplicity of representations of \\\\mathfrak{g} directly by algebraic means, as in Section 10.3 of Hall's book. See also: fusion category (which is semisimple).

The attacks, which occurred in more than six different locations, resulted in 44 deaths.  Attacks  Militants launched simultaneous assaults involving mortars and car bombs on security facilities in the North Sinai towns of El-Arish, Sheikh Zuweid and Rafah, targeting the army's Battalion 101 following the North Sinai curfew hours that began after 7 pm and ended at 6 am. In Al-Arish, police offices and an army base were the first targets hit, followed by a military-owned hotel which sustained heavy rocket attacks, then came the car bomb explosion at the rear gate of the army base. A number of security checkpoints were also hit later in the day, including one south of the city and one in Rafah. The Sheikh Zuweid attack involved the Al-Zohor military camp, which was hit by mortar shells. Residents of the Sinai and the Egyptian state news media reported that the attackers had used multiple car bombs and mortars against their targets. = Security response = Egyptian warplanes bombed militant targets in the region where the attacks took place. The following day Apache helicopters also launched air raids on alleged militant spots. It was also reported that on 6 February 2015 Egyptian security forces launched an attack, killing 47 Islamic militants in Northern Sinai.Reuters, 6 February 2015: Egyptian military kills 47 militants in the Sinai  Casualties  44 people were killed overall. Wilayat Sinai, however, released a statement where it said that \\"hundreds\\" were killed, a claim that was rejected by the military which said that the numbers will not be announced. Estimates of the wounded range from 62 to over a hundred. Most of the casualties were a result of the first attacks on the hotel and military base, during which 25 people were killed, including nine civilians, and more than 58 were wounded.  Damage  Parts of the Al-Arish National Museum, which holds numerous artifacts and paintings from ancient times, were destroyed during the bombings, including the main front and one of the sides of the building which later collapsed as a result. However, the head of the Museums Sector at the Ministry of State of Antiquities, Ahmad Sharaf, confirmed that none of the museum's antiques were harmed during the incident. Government newspaper Al-Ahram said that one of its offices, which is opposite to the hotel and base that were hit, was completely destroyed during the attacks. It is unclear, however, whether the office was a target of the assault or not.  Responsibility  The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant linked militant group Wilayat Sinai, formerly known as Ansar Bait al-Maqdis until it pledged allegiance to ISIL in November 2014, claimed responsibility for the attacks on an affiliated Twitter account. Wilayat Sinai said that the incidents were part of a series of attacks that they had dubbed \\"We Swear We Will Revenge\\", which the group dedicated to \\"avenge for women and girls\\" held in government prisons.  Reactions  ;Domestic In response to the attacks, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who was attending the African Union summit in Ethiopia at the time, cut short his visit and returned to Egypt. Sisi ordered the establishment of a \\"unified command to combat terrorism\\" in the Sinai Peninsula and put Osama Askar, commander of the Third Field Army, in charge of the command after promoting him to lieutenant-general. Sisi's decree was announced by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF). During a meeting between Sisi and the SCAF, plans have been discussed to combat the \\"qualitative development of terrorist operations in Sinai,\\" despite \\"the success of daily strong blows to terrorist hotbeds\\". After the meeting, Sisi made a live address to the nation, where he said: \\"I am ready to die [for Egypt]... and meet God for what I have done\\". He also hinted back at the period before the 2013 protests and ouster of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, claiming he had spoken with a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood who allegedly told him that people would come \\"from all around the world\\" to fight him. ;International The African Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the Security Council condemned the attacks, along with the governments of Bahrain, China, Cyprus, Hungary, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States. Furthermore, Hassan Firouzabadi, top commander of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, said that the attackers were \\"helping the Zionist occupiers\\". \\"The Islamic forces are deployed in Sinai desert to prevent the Zionists‚Äô aggression on Muslim territories, including the strategic Sinai Peninsula, and attacking them is a foolish act.\\", Firouzabadi said.
