Its most recent iteration, Cortex Prime, was designed by Cam Banks and published by Fandom Tabletop. Prior versions appeared in the licensed roleplaying games published by Margaret Weis Productions, where it was used as the house system. Cortex is an adaptable game system focusing on characterization and story development. Game mechanics Cortex is an extensible and modifiable game, but a few elements are common to all games. Characters are described with a number of trait sets, such as attributes, skills, relationships, or powers. Each trait within each set is rated with a die size. For example, a strong but unintelligent character might have Brawn d10 and Brains d4. When rolling dice, players select one trait from each set and roll their dice together as a pool. Dice that roll 1 are 'hitches,' and represent something going wrong in the attempt. The highest two die results are added together for the player character's effective total. Another die not used in the total is selected as the effect die, the size of which determines the magnitude of the die roll's impact. Players also have access to a limited pool of 'plot point' tokens, which can be spent in a number of ways. Prominent among these is to roll more than one die from a single trait set, or to add additional die results to the total. Most Cortex games include Distinctions as one of the trait sets, which describe what makes the character distinctive. These traits are rolled as a d8 when they are beneficial. When the distinction hinders the character, however, it is rolled as a d4, and the player earns a plot point. History The earliest predecessor to Cortex was the Sovereign Stone Game System, produced by Sovereign Press, Inc and published by Corsair Publishing, based on the Sovereign Stone novels. The game was written by Larry Elmore and Don Perrin. Cortex Classic In 2004, the rights to Sovereign Stone was transferred to Margaret Weis Productions, where the system was used for the Serenity Role Playing Game, published in 2005. The game system was used, with minor amendments, for Battlestar Galactica Role Playing Game in 2007 and Supernatural Role Playing Game in 2009. The game was released as a standalone, generic roleplaying game in 2008 as Cortex Role Playing Game System. Cortex Plus In 2009, Cortex development was passed to Cam Banks, who refined it into \\"Cortex Plus\\" by introducing its roll-and-keep system and streamlining all ranked stats to use die sizes that could be rolled in various conflicts. Cortex Plus saw its debut in 2010 with Smallville Roleplaying Game and Leverage: The Roleplaying Game. Both games were developed concurrently, with design notes passed between writing teams, but each game featured unique variations on the basic Plus engine. The next round of development saw Banks create Marvel Heroic Roleplaying, published in 2012. This game focused on action sequences and fights. The core game was originally slated to be followed by a long series of supplements, each focusing on a different historical period of Marvel's fictional history. However, in 2013, Margaret Weis Productions announced that it would not be renewing its Marvel license,archive.org link of MWP press release and the game went out of print. The Cortex Plus Hackers Guide, an anthology compilation of many different 'hacks' of Cortex Plus, was initiated in January 2013. Without the licenses for the three existing games, the Hacker's Guide presented three 'flavors' of Cortex Plus: drama, action, and heroic. Monica Valentinelli then developed the Firefly Role-Playing Game, published in 2014. Firefly was primarily based on the Leverage rule set. Cortex Prime On November 1, 2016, Margaret Weis Productions released a statement announcing that Cam Banks and his new design studio Magic Vacuum had licensed the Cortex system and would be \\"taking over the design, development, and publishing of games based on these rules... for 2017 and beyond,\\" coinciding with \\"Margaret’s retirement from RPG development to focus on her current novel and film projects.\\"Statement on Margaret Weis Productions web site Banks then set out to normalize the four games of the Cortex Plus era as well as the preceding four Classic games into a single, unified system. This iteration, Cortex Prime, was funded via Kickstarter in April of 2017. Prime discards the 'drama, action, and heroic' flavors of Plus and instead offers an extensibly modular system that can be custom-built for vastly different play experiences. As part of the Kickstarter stretch goals, five volumes of \\"spotlight\\" mini settings, compiled by 22 authors, were also planned and funded. In September 2019, Fandom Tabletop acquired the rights to Cortex from MWP and hired Cam Banks as their new Cortex Creative Director.Fandom Acquires Cortex RPG Rules System and Hires Cam Banks Fandom intends to publish the Cortex Game Handbook in 2020.Kickstarter August Update: Final PDF, Xadia, and Grayskull In 2021, Fandom plans to publish the five volumes of spotlights, as well as two licensed game settings: Tales of Xadia: The Dragon Prince Roleplaying Game based on The Dragon Prince television show,‘The Dragon Prince’ Tabletop RPG ‘Tales Of Xadia’ Announced and Legends of Grayskull: The Masters of the Universe Roleplaying Game based on The Masters of the Universe franchise.Become Masters of the Universe in New LEGENDS OF GRAYSKULL RPG ReferencesExternal links * Cortex RPG Official Site Category:American role-playing games Category:New Zealand role- playing games Category:Role-playing games based on television series Category:Margaret Weis Productions games Category:Marvel Comics role-playing games Category:Role-playing game systems ","title":"Cortex System"},{"id":"64782404","text":"Roniti Teiwaki is an I-Kiribati politician.

António Tomás da Guarda Cabreira de Faria e Alvelos Drago da Ponte (30 October 1868 - 21 November 1953) was a Portuguese mathematician, polygraph and publicist. A member of the aristocratic Cabreira family, António Cabreira was a claimant to the Miguelist noble titles of Count of Lagos and Viscount of Vale da Mata, which he used. António Cabreira is notable for his vast published work on an extensive variety of different fields (among them mathematics and geometry — one of his papers posited a solution for the problem of squaring the circle, as well as that of circling the square, cubing the sphere, and sphering the cube — mechanics, astronomy, literature, art, anthropology, philosophy, sociology, history, archaeology, insurance, jurisprudence, politics, and military organisation), and for spearheading the creation of many ephemeral learned societies, chief among them the Academy of Sciences of Portugal (created in 1907 after dissension with the Lisbon Academy of Sciences) and the António Cabreira Institute (established in 1919). Early life and education Birthplace of António Cabreira, in Tavira (currently the Municipal Archive) António Cabreira was born at 4:30 p.m.Livro de Registo de Baptismos 1869 (folha 15 v.), Paróquia de Santa Maria do Castelo, Tavira - Arquivo Distrital de Faro on 30 October 1868, in the family home in Tavira, on the corner of Rua Borda de Água de Aguiar and Rua da Alegria (renamed in 1917, Rua Jacques Pessoa and Rua Dr. António Cabreira, respectively). He was the son of General Tomás António da Guarda Cabreira (1822–1886) and his wife D. Francisca Emília Pereira da Silva from Ponta Delgada; on his father's side, he was the grandson of Tomás António da Guarda Cabreira (1792–1834), a field marshal in the Miguelist army during the Portuguese Civil War, who had been granted the titles of Count of Lagos and Viscount of Vale da Mata by the Miguelist faction. António Cabreira was the younger brother of Colonel Tomás Cabreira (1865–1918), a Republican politician who taught Chemistry at the Lisbon Polytechnic School and who briefly occupied the office of Minister of Finance in 1914. António Cabreira was baptized at the Church of Saint Mary of the Castle, on 17 February 1869. As a child, Cabreira was taught by Fr. Francisco de Paula da Fonseca Neves, parish priest of Lumiar in Lisbon, but abandoned his studies at age 12 to accompany his father while he served as a lieutenant colonel in Porto and in Lagos. In 1885, at age 17, he enrolled in the National Lyceum of Faro, and from 1887 to 1889, went to study in Lisbon. At age 21, after a medical committee turned him down as physically unfit for a military career like that of his father and grandfather, he started attending the marine engineering course at the Lisbon Polytechnic School: it was around this time that he became engaged in politics (a fact that once again forced him to interrupt his studies), having joined the Legitimist Party. He quickly rose though the ranks and filled several positions in the party leadership, having successfully brought student grievances to public attention and lobbied for student welfare. In 1891, Cabreira became the Political Editor of the periodical A Nação, the official organ of the Legitimist Party. Academia Photograph of António Cabreira, published in 1914 In 1894, António Cabreira established the Instituto Dezanove de Setembro (Nineteenth of September Institute; the birthday of Miguel, Duke of Braganza), which provided primary and secondary education courses. Cabreira was at first occupied with the management of the institution; in 1899, he began teaching Rational Mechanics and Philosophy of Mathematics to the Institute's Science students. In the wake of the generalised nationalist sentiment brought about after the 1890 British Ultimatum, António Cabreira became active in the Lisbon Geographic Society, vigorously promoting Portuguese colonialism. In the 1890s, António Cabreira started publishing his numerous monographs that brought to light his mathematical discoveries and his novel viewpoints on philosophy and sociology: among these first works are Análise Geométrica de Duas Espirais Parabólicas (\\"Geometric Analysis of Two Parabolic Spirals\\", 1895), Sobre as Propriedades Geométricas da Espiral de Poinsot (\\"On the Geometric Properties of Poinsot's Spiral\\", 1896), Descoberta e Primeiras Propriedades Geométricas de uma Espiral Binómia do Primeiro Grau (\\"Discovery and First Geometric Properties of a Binomial Spiral of the First Degree\\", 1897). In 1896, the Geographic Society publicly lauded his first works as \\"scientific successes\\". On 18 March 1897, he was simultaneous and unanimously elected a fellow of the Royal Academy of Sciences and a foreign associate of the Academy of Sciences, Inscriptions, and Fine Arts of Toulouse. He later became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences and Letters of Montpellier (29 March 1898), of the Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Fine Arts of Dijon (3 March 1897), of the Academy of Political and Social Sciences of Venezuela (7 March 1922), a corresponding academic of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona (31 March 1909), and a corresponding academic of the International Academy of Letters and Sciences of Naples (6 April 1921). He was awarded a honorary doctorate in Mathematics by the University of Arizona on 18 June 1912, and was bestowed with the University of Amsterdam's Medal of Honour on 23 December 1933, on the occasion of its tricentennial. In 1907, António Cabreira founded the Academy of Sciences of Portugal, as an competing institution to the old Lisbon Royal Academy of Sciences. The new, short-lived Academy (dissolved in 1925), was a reflection of Cabreira's partisanship of absolutism and his loathing for the declining liberal monarchy and its institutions; the new Academy attracted valuable support from leading figures of the republican movement — unlikely allies but also oppositionists to the regime — chief among them prominent politicians (and later Presidents of the Republic) Teófilo Braga, Bernardino Machado, and António José de Almeida. After the 1910 Revolution, the Republican authorities were quick to approve the statutes of the new Academy in an attempt to legitimise it into an official academy of the regime, but in due course, and especially after Braga's death in 1924, it started to lose its relative importance and fading into obscurity as the old Lisbon Academy was gradually assimilated into the new regime. Nevertheless, the Academy was successively enlarged by the creation of \\"Annexed Institutes\\", with the intention of disseminating the Academy's \\"patriotic and educational work\\" throughout the Portuguese World. These included: *The Instituto Teofiliano (\\"Theophilian Institute\\"), established in 1912, named after its patron, Teófilo Braga, and devoted to the study of his literary and political work; *The Instituto de Trabalhos Sociais (\\"Institute for Social Works\\"), established in 1914, that worked with a trade association representing national matchmakers so their products could compete with foreign ones in the Portuguese colonies; *The Instituto Arqueológico do Algarve (\\"Algarve Archeological Institute\\"), established in 1915; *The Instituto Histórico do Minho (\\"Minho Historical Institute\\"), established in 1916 and headquartered in the 15th-century Casa dos Arcos in Viana do Castelo, under the patronage of explorer Gonçalo Velho; *The Instituto António Cabreira (\\"António Cabreira Institute\\"), established in 1919, named after Cabreira himself, with the goal of studying and divulging \\"his valuable work and his relevant services to Science and Homeland\\"; *The Instituto Científico-Literário de Trás-os-Montes (\\"Trás-os-Montes Scientific and Literary Institute\\"); *The Instituto Histórico-Arqueológico do Alentejo (\\"Alentejo Historical and Archeological Institute\\"), headquartered in Évora and with braches in other district capitals in Alentejo; *The Instituto Etnológico da Beira-Alta/Viseu (\\"Beira Alta/Viseu Ethnological Institute\\"). António Cabreira was also responsible for the First Colonial Congress in 1900, and the First National Pedagogical Congress in 1908. In 1920, Cabreira hosted the First National Archaeological Congress (Congresso Arqueológico Nacional), held in Tavira. Even though it was sparsely attended by the Portuguese archaeologists, the Congress was notable for defending the principle of archaeological exploration across the country and the safeguarding and promotion of archaeological heritage, and for criticising the established practices of the National Archaeology Museum. Criticism Caricature of António Cabreira studying a chamber pot, published in Bordalo Pinheiro's satirical periodical A Paródia in 1902. The text reads: \\"Do not be surprised by the presence of this object [...]. I am using it for the sake of convenience: while I can use the rim to test my new method for the division of the circumference, I can also use the inside to unload my ideas.\\" Antonio Cabreira had an inflated sense of his own academic importance and of the significance of his work. Due to his prolific published monographs on a vast array of different areas of knowledge, he soon created a public image of great intellectual dynamism and exaggerated cultural protagonism. This was heightened by his frequent self-congratulatory publications and speeches, particularly one delivered to the Lisbon Academy of Sciences in 1922 and published under the title Discurso Comemorativo das suas Bodas de Prata Académicas e Epítome dos Trabalhos Apresentados na Academia das Ciências de Lisboa (\\"Commemorative Speech of His Academic Silver Jubilee and the Epitome of his Work Presented before the Lisbon Academy of Sciences\\"). His numerous published monographs frequently featured a title page framed by a sprawling full list of his honorary distinctions, mentioning each of his many memberships in national and international learned societies and were accompanied by fanciful photographic portraits of Cabreira in elaborate academic garb, decked in collars and decorations. This recurring posture inspired harsh criticism from some figures of the Portuguese cultural and academic scene, such as physician and politician Augusto de Vasconcelos, and the priest, theologian and Camões scholar José Maria Rodrigues. Rodolfo Guimarães denounced the quality of Cabreira's work in the field of mathematics and did not go without answer: Cabreira refuted every last of Guimarães's objections in two separate monographs (Quelques mots sur les mathématiques en Portugal, 1905; and Les Mathématiques en Portugal, 1910) — in which he defended his own mathematical work as \\"original and important\\". Rather telling is Cabreira's response to the French Academy of Sciences's refusal to publish one of his papers, by arguing that its reception being registered in the Academy's comptes-rendus was in itself proof of its scientific merit: > \\"Le fait de la Note être mentionnée dans les Comptes Rendus démontre déjà > l'existence de quelque valeur, puisque ni tous les travaux adressés à > l'Académie sont présentés en scéance. En outre, mon travail ne pouvait être > publié par cette très haute corporation scientifique en conséquence d'avoir > un caractère très élémentaire.\\" Death and legacy The Cabreira family plot in the Tavira Municipal Cemetery; the inscription pertaining to António Cabreira reads: \\"DOCTOR ANTONIO CABREIRA, COUNT OF LAGOS / FELLOW OF THE LISBON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES\\". António Cabreira died in Lisbon, on 21 November 1953, and was interred in the family plot, in the Municipal Cemetery in Tavira, beside the remains of his parents, General Tomás António da Guarda Cabreira and D. Francisca Emília Cabreira, as well as those of his brother, Colonel Tomás Cabreira. The imposing funerary monument is decorated with the arms attributed to the Counts of Lagos, and architectural motifs of lions, armillary spheres, and the crosses of the Military Order of Aviz and of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword. The back of the monument is inscribed: > EIS UM MOIMENTO DIGNO E QUE A SAUDADE ERGUEU > PARA REPÔR NA MORTE O MEU DESFEITO LAR > JULHO 5 DE 1928 > (\\"Behold a dignified monument that longing built / to set right, in death, > my broken home / 5 July 1928\\") The mausoleum was unveiled with much pomp on 5 July 1928, in the presence of the Civil Governor of Faro District (standing in for the President of the Republic), as well as representatives of the Ministers of War and of Public Instruction, the local Mayor, the Military Commander, the Municipal Administrator, and the parish priest. A bust of António Cabreira by sculptor Raul Xavier was unveiled in 1944 in the Public Park in Tavira, in the presence of Cabreira himself, on the occasion of his Academic Golden Jubilee. In 1942, Cabreira donated the house in which he was born (located on a street that currently bears his name) to the local City Council, as a suitable place to hold the Municipal Archive; it serves that purpose to this day. His personal archive, as well as the furniture in his personal study, was left to the Lisbon Geographic Society.

As a descendent of Paio Peres Correia, António Cabreira had the rank of \\"Knight of Honour\\". The Order's statutes were approved by the Government, the Cardinal-Patriarch of Lisbon (António Mendes Belo), and the Bishop of Faro; however, by 1947, the Order was seemingly dormant and the State had forbidden its use in official ceremonies.

straddle the border between northern Thailand and north-central Laos, and the highlands that stretch eastward across north-central Laos. While much of the forest cover has been degraded, there are still large areas of relatively untouched forest.  Location and description  The Luang Prabang range is the easternmost of the north-south mountain ranges of northern Thailand. Together with the highlands of north-central Loas they form an ecoregion of very high rainfall (2,000-3,000 mm/year) and a relatively long dry season.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification (Aw)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year (all months being greater than average temperature), and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, but more than (100-(monthly average)/25) mm. The dry month usually at or right after the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. Rainfall in the mountains of northern Laos can average 2,000-3,000 mm/year.  Flora and fauna  There is not one single type of rainforest in the ecoregion. Rather, there are many different forest communities reflecting location, altitude, and local climate. Starting at 800 meters elevation, the lower tropical seasonal rainforest becomes the montane rainforest, with a dominant canopy of Dipterocarpus turbinatus (source of keruing wood), and Wax tree ( Toxicodendron succedaneum). Also present at this transitional level are palm trees such as the Sugar palm (Arenga pinnata). At elevations of 1,500 meters, broadleaf evergreen forests of Castanopsis hystrix are found. The low, open nature of the forest may be due to past clearing or fire. At these levels there are also conifer hardwood forests of Quercus griffithii (an oak with an oblong crown) and Keteleeria (Keteleeria evelyniana). Thinner soils support (Engelhardia) on granitic soils, or Khasi pine (Pinus kesiya) on clay or sandstone. Due to the relative isolation area, there are significant populations of rare large mammals including the critically endangered Red- shanked douc, the endangered Asian elephant and the endangered Eld's deer. Over 540 bird species are known to have territory extending into the ecoregion.  Protected areas  Protected areas in the ecoregion include: * Nam Phouy National Biodiversity Conservation Area, home to the largest population of wild elephants in Laos. (2,000 km2) * Khun Nan National Park, on the Thai side of the Luang Prabang, known for its waterfalls and streams. (249 km2) * Phou Khao Khouay, 40 km north of Vientaine in Laos, with three large rivers flowing into the Mekong River. (80,000 km2) * Phu Luang Wildlife Sanctuary, i northern Thailand, supports a population of 100 wild Asian Elephants. (897 km2). * Nam Nao National Park, in the Luang Prabang of northern, supporting Thailand different forest types, deciduous and evergreen.

It is located within the former town of Walden in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The complex is owned and operated by Vale Limited, which is notable in the area for its mining operations. History=Before the dam People of the indigenous First Nations have inhabited the area for thousands of years. Groups such as the Ojibwe and Odawa used the Vermilion River as a transportation corridor, living in seasonal camps along its length and crossing troublesome sections, like falls and rapids, with portages. European colonization of the area formally began with the 1850 Robinson-Huron Treaty, and began to intensify after the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway's Algoma Branch in the 1880s, running parallel and to the north of the river. Townships were surveyed along the line around this time, including Lorne Township, named after John Campbell, the Marquis of Lorne, who had recently been Governor General of Canada. The stretch of river in Lorne Township was soon the site of significant logging operations, as well as settlement by Finnish homesteaders. At the same time, small mining operations had sprung up around the Sudbury area, facilitated by rapid technological changes, relative ease of extraction, and the logistics advantages created by the railway. Among these was the Mond Nickel Company, founded by the German- British chemist and industrialist Ludwig Mond. In 1900, Mond opened the Victoria Mine in Denison Township, which initially operated using cordwood boilers to produce steam power at the smelter. As a fuel source, however, wood was a quickly-depleting resource in the area due to intensive deforestation caused by logging, wood-burning, and clearance for new settlements. Mond was a smaller competitor to the Canadian Copper Company, whose subsidiary the Huronian Power Company (established by 1902) had developed the High Falls dam on the Spanish River to leverage hydropower for its mining and smelting operations. Mond would follow suit with its own competing subsidiary, the Lorne Power Company. Construction and early operations The Lorne Power Company's first major project was the Wabagishik dam at Lorne Falls. Dam construction occurred in either 1908 or 1909, and the plant was commissioned in 1909. By the end of the year, the generating station was connected to the Victoria Mine, which switched to electric power, though not soon enough to save the lives of two workers who had died in 1908 when a steam boiler exploded. The Lorne Falls plant was followed in 1915 by the Nairn Falls Dam and Generating Plant on the Spanish River, also owned and managed by the Lorne Power Company. Both plants provided 60 Hz power to Mond's operations, in contrast to the 25 Hz produced by Inco's Huronian Power Company. In 1929, 20 years after operations at the plant began, the Mond company merged with the International Nickel Company, or Inco, which was the Canadian Copper Company's corporate successor. Not long after this, the Lorne Power Company was also merged into the Huronian Power Company, bringing its pair of plants under Huronian management. By 1952, Huronian was managing five main plants: the Lorne pair as well as three of its own construction, and still operating parallel 25 Hz and 60 Hz distribution networks. The 60 Hz power from the former Lorne plants was being supplied to the Garson Mine, Lawson quarry, and the smelters at Creighton, Copper Cliff, and Coniston. Recent history In the mid-2010s, safety inspections revealed deterioration of the concrete of the spillway, which was causing safety and stability issues with the dam. A 2016 assessment resulted in a \\"moderate\\" hazard potential rating, and rehabilitation of the existing spillway structure was discounted due to the level of deterioration, resulting in a decision to replace the original spillway. The dam owner, Vale Limited, conducted a number of surveys of fish populations around the dam, which included minnows, perch, pike, suckers, sunfish, bullheads, and walleye. Other species identified as being potentially affected by construction work included painted and snapping turtles, as well as seven species of bat. Ultimately, a minimum flow provision was added to the spillway replacement project to improve walleye spawning conditions at the base of the spillway, along with a post-construction monitoring program and a staged timeline of bush clearing recommended to minimize the impact on bat habitat. Geography and hydrography The dam sits on the Vermilion River, downstream from Ella Lake (which is the dam's headpond) and upstream from Wabagishik Lake. It is located in the geographic Lorne Township, Concession No. 3, Lot No. 8, within the boundaries of the former town of Walden, now a part of Greater Sudbury in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. The nearest sizable communities are Lively to the east and Nairn Centre to the west; the nearest city is Sudbury to the east, whose municipal boundaries the complex falls within.

Allmand was born in 1885 at Wrexham, England, however he always said he was Welsh. His father was a flour miller called Frank Allmand. He studied at the University of Liverpool starting in 1902, and attained honours in 1905. In 1906 he undertook an M.Sc, and in 1910 a Doctor of Science. He then went to Karlsruhe and Dresden Germany from 1910 to 1912. From 1913 to 1919 he was an assistant lecturer at University of Liverpool. He was in Germany at the start of World War I in 1914, and had to escape the country via Poland, Russia and Sweden. During the war he had the job as Assistant Chemical Advisor, where he had to overcome chemical warfare. A Military Cross was awarded to him in 1916. His next job was the Professor of Chemistry in King’s College, London starting in 1919 until 1950, when he retired. During this time he also served as Dean of the faculty, and was also titled as \\"Senior Professor\\". In 1929 he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society. He was president of the Faraday Society from 1947 to 1948. He served as vice-president of the Chemical Society. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, a member of Electroplaters Technical Society, American Chemical Society and the Deutsche Bunsen Gesellschaft. He studied electrochemistry and photochemistry. He married Mile Marguerite Marie S. Malicorne in 1920 and had three children, Marguerite, Michael, and Christopher. A Victoria Cross was awarded posthumously to Michael, and was presented to his family by King George VI at Buckingham Palace on 17 July 1945. A. J. Allmand died in 1951 after a botched operation.

The campaign was launched in June 2020 with a public petition. It urges the American Ornithological Society to commit to \\"address the issue of eponymous honors and other potentially derogatory, oppressive, or simply irrelevant holdovers in English common names\\".  Background  The American Ornithological Society (AOS) maintains a checklist of birds of North America, and claims responsibility for arbitrating the official common names of birds occurring in this area. Proposals for name changes can be submitted to the North American Classification and Nomenclature Committee (NACC) of the AOS. The Bird Names for Birds websites notes several notable past proposals, including a rejected proposal to change the name of Maui Parrotbill to a newly created name in the Hawaiian language, and a proposal to change the name of Oldsquaw to Long-tailed Duck. This latter proposal was accepted, but the comments on the decision by NACC stated that considerations of \\"political correctness\\" alone were not enough to merit a name change. In 2018, Robert Driver, a graduate student at East Carolina University, filed a proposal to the NACC, requesting that they change the English common name used for McCown's longspur, named after Confederate general John Porter McCown. The proposal was rejected by NACC citing the need to maintain stability in naming conventions but also deferring the matter to further discussion. In 2020, following weeks of widespread \\"Black Lives Matter\\" protests following the killing of George Floyd and calls for racial justice in the United States, Confederate monuments and memorials were toppled by protesters or removed by city officials across the country. After the Central Park birdwatching incident led to initiatives like Black Birders Week, increasing attention was paid to eponymous bird names, particularly those honoring historical figures with links to slavery.  Campaign  The AOS changed the name of this species from \\"oldsquaw\\" to \\"long-tailed duck\\" in 2000. On June 22, 2020, the Bird Names for Birds campaign was launched through a letter to the American Ornithological Society, penned by ornithologists Gabriel Foley and Jordan Rutter, and co-signed by 180 other individuals. The co-founders of the initiative argue that \\"honorific names cast long, dark shadows over our beloved birds and represent colonialism, racism and inequality. It is long overdue that we acknowledge the problem of such names, and it is long overdue that we should change them.\\" Besides McCown's longspur, other common bird names with problematic eponymous or honorific references mentioned by the campaign include Bachman's sparrow, Townsend's warbler, Bendire's thrasher, and Hammond's flycatcher. By August 2020, over 2,300 individuals had signed the petition, which received formal support by the American Bird Conservancy. On July 24, 2020, a second proposal to change the McCown's longspur's name was submitted to NACC by Robert Driver and by NACC chair and Smithsonian researcher Terry Chesser, after consulting with the AOS Diversity and Inclusion Committee.  Response  On July 8, 2020, AOS president Kathy Martin announced that the society's leadership was developing \\"new society- level policies in our nomenclature\\", and that next steps would be formally announced during the 2020 edition of the society's annual conference. On August 7, 2020, NACC announced the decision to change the common name of Rhynchophanes mccownii from McCown's longspur to thick-billed longspur, as a literal translation of its genus name, Rhynchophanes, following a unanimous vote. The organizers of the Bird Names for Birds campaign welcomed the decision, but emphasized the need to address other 149 common bird names that they consider equally problematic.  Precedents  Concerns about the legacy of eponyms in science have been raised in a variety of disciplines. Medical eponyms associated with Nazi human experimentation or Nazi politics have long fallen out of favor or have been selectively deprecated by the medical community. Since 2007, the Israel Medical Association Journal and European Neurology have maintained lists of eponyms honoring Nazis and their collaborators. Some physicians have argued the use of eponyms in the medical nomenclature should be discontinued altogether, while others have argued that such eponyms should be retained as \\"a means of conveying immortal dishonor.\\" In 2015 the Swedish Ornithological Society completed its first global list of over 10,000 Swedish bird names and, through the process, decided to remove a number of potentially offensive names it had identified. The 2020 protests against racism further encouraged academic institutions and scholarly societies to remove potentially offensive references from journal names or academic prizes. In August 2020, NASA announced the decision to deprecate widely used nicknames for a number of astronomical objects, stating that \\"they are not only insensitive, but can be actively harmful.\\" In a press release, the agency said that Eskimo is \\"widely viewed as a colonial term with a racist history, imposed on the Indigenous people of Arctic regions.\\" The decision established that planetary nebula NGC 2392, historically known as the \\"Eskimo Nebula\\", among other astronomical objects, should be uniquely referred to by their catalog numbers.

The sport was briefly popular among some members of the metropolitan upper classes in the US, UK and France. Although the bullets were made of soft wax they could inflict significant damage to exposed flesh. For this reason the competitors wore heavy protective clothing and guards. The sport was demonstrated at the 1908 Olympic Games but did not survive the First World War. It may be seen as a precursor of the modern sport of paintballing. History A duelist protected against wax bullets. Fencing, or sport duelling with swords has existed at least since the middle ages and featured in the first Olympic Games of 1896. In 1901 Dr. John Paul Devillers, a French target shooter, developed a wax bullet specifically designed to allow non- fatal or sport pistol duelling between opponents. Devillers developed a mask to protect the face and persuaded the French gun making firm Piot-Lepage to manufacture appropriate weapons. In 1904 he founded Le Societe de l'Assaut au Pistolet, effectively the first pistol sport dueling club. By 1905 the club had over 100 members including Cosmo Duff Gordon, Walter Winans and Frances's ex-president Casimir Perier. Clubs were also established in the UK and US. In 1908 pistol sport dueling was demonstrated at the London Olympics. In 1909 a match was conducted outside the Carnegie Hall in New York. The sport continued into the second decade of the 20th Century but became outmoded after the First World War. As stated by V.G. Kiernan, a historian of duelling, \\"... the First World War may not have been the war to end all wars, but it was perhaps the duel to end all duels.\\" Rules Competitors wore a face mask incorporating a heavy plate glass visor. Leather or heavy cloth overgarments protected the body. The pistols included a steel shield similar to that found on an epee to protect the shooter’s hand. The two competitors, would stand at a distance of twenty or twenty-five yards (18 or 23 metres) apart, each armed with a pistol carrying a single charge and wax bullet. Each duellist was accompanied by a commissaire de tir who would perform the role of Second and also use a stopwatch to measure the time taken for their duellist to fire. A director asked the duellists: \\"Are you ready ?\\" At this question the competitors were to cock their weapons, then reply: \\"Yes.\\" Both must answer. The director then gave the words: \\"Fire! One!—Two!—Three!\\" Each competitor had to aim and fire between the first sound of the word \\"fire\\" and the last of the word \\"three\\".

He rose to international prominence after appearances on NBC’s Little Big Shots, and The Ellen DeGeneres Show. His life and early career as a makeup artist (MUA) are featured in Quest Red's reality docuseries Being Reuben which aired in January 2020 in the U.K., then rebroadcast August 2020 in North America on The CW. As of August 2020, he has 233,000 YouTube subscribers, and 315,000 Instagram followers. Women's Wear Daily calls de Main “one of Gen Z’s most unconventional beauty influencers”.  Early life and education  Reuben de Maid was born in Cardiff, Wales in March 2005 to parents Vicki, a salon owner, and father, Matthew, a lawyer. Cardiff is a “conservative area”, but Reuben generally felt safe to pursue dressing up, and playing with makeup at home, as well as advancing a beauty career. Reuben first got interested in makeup around the age of eight, during his primary school years, and started watching YouTube videos by “fabulous” people like Patrick Starrr. De Maid said, \\"I used to watch my phone for hours on end, learning from tutorials and blogs, seeing how to do it.\\" He practiced and then started his own YouTube channel and improved over time; he has been on social media since he was eight including Instagram. He finds experimenting with makeup to be therapeutic. It was years later he would realize that he was a part of breaking the gender stereotypes of the beauty industry. His parents were supportive but his mother did warn him other people might troll or online bully him. He started attending a drama school at night and was bullied both verbally and physically. At first he kept the harassment secret from his family but found relief later by talking about the experiences. He transferred to another school where the students were more accepting. At around ten years old, his parents amicably spilt, his father lives about two miles away and is still in the family’s lives.  Career  De Maid came to international attention in April 2017 when he appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show talking about, and displaying both his makeup and singing skills, and spoke of being bullied. He sang “And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going” from the 1981 Dreamgirls musical; and was surprised by Kim Kardashian West. He was compared to the “flamboyant” Adam Lambert. Host DeGeneres gifted him with “a laptop, make-up and lights so he could start his own make-up tutorial channel on YouTube”. After Ellen he also appeared on the reality show Keeping Up With the Kardashians. He later performed on the children's variety show Little Big Shots and his clip went viral. Back in the U.K. he appeared on Good Morning Britain, and This Morning talking about the trolling and bullying he has survived. He took part in a public service announcement for AntiBullyingPro, along with other celebrities. Although he has been experimenting with makeup since he was eight, he has only focused on his beauty influencer career since 2018. He practices a couple times a week after school and on weekends. He films and edits himself taking up to three hours to film, and up to the same time to edit. The BBC News noted that as of April 2017 “Men are making huge gains in the make-up industry. Brands including CoverGirl and Anastasia Beverly Hills now have male models to showcase their products. Earlier this year Manny Gutierrez was hired as Maybelline's first male face to represent their brand.” Women's Wear Daily calls de Main “one of Gen Z’s most unconventional beauty influencers”. In 2019 a United Kingdom Ricochet Ltd.—a Warner Bros. International Television Production Company—and Krempelwood Ltd.-produced “observational docuseries”, Being Reuben, was secured by The CW American network for the summer 2020 schedule. In an interview about his goals de Maid states, \\"I hope I give young boys and other young people the hope that they can do makeup if they love it, ... I just want to send the message across a bigger platform to fight the prejudice against boys in makeup and to equalize the fact that men and women are the same and makeup doesn't have an agenda.\\" The six-part series had previously aired on Quest Red in the U.K. and Ireland in 2019; it was filmed when de Main was fourteen. According to Women's Wear Daily, he “represents a wave of Gen Z beauty influencers who are more diverse, gender-fluid and beauty-savvy than ever. Members of Gen Z are digital natives and have an inherent understanding of technology — especially social media, which for them, is often identity- driven.” , Gen Z spends about $140 billion directly. As of January 2020, he has over 500,000 followers on Instagram and YouTube including Kim Kardashian- West. The two filmed a makeup tutorial together which has 8.3 million views as of January 2020. His Instagram followers are 85 percent female and mostly aged 18-24, from the U.S. and U.K. He also has an eyelash range with London-based W7 cosmetics, his first product collaboration. W7 put together a Here Come the Boys campaign, a group of boy beauty influencers is shown breaking stereotypes in the first episode of Being Reuben. For the campaign De Maid was the lead as W7's brand ambassador—De Maid’s first ambassadorship—of the group of ten “of the UK's leading male influencers and makeup artists” (MUA). De Maid has also created content for other brands including Kardashian's KKW Beauty which she had gifted De Maid during his first Ellen appearance.  Personal life  De Maid lives in Llandaff, Wales with his mother Vicki, two younger siblings, a sister and brother, and an older brother. As seen in Being Reuben, Vicki's father also helps take care of the three children.

The volcanic field has been deeply eroded, in many places to Proterozoic basement rock, and the underlying plutons are widely exposed. The western part of the field has been thrown down by faulting on the eastern margin of the Rio Grande rift and deeply buried under younger lava flows and sediments of the rift (Servilleta Basalt and Santa Fe Group).Johnson et al. 1989 Erosional remnants of the Latir field are found on the west side of the Rio Grande rift in the Tusas Mountains. Paleoproterozoic quartz monzonite just outside the ring dike of the Questa caldera The oldest rocks in the field have been dated to the Paleoproterozoic and range in age from 1750 Ma to 1690 Ma. The older rocks are thus among the oldest rocks exposed in New Mexico.Bauer and Williams 1989 These were overlain by Mississippian limestone and Pennsylvanian and Permian red beds. The area was thrust eastward during the Laramide orogeny, then eroded to low relief, removing much of the sedimentary cover and depositing small amounts of Eocene to Oligocene sediments. The Latir volcanic field was erupted onto this surface. The earliest volcanism began about 30 Ma and consisted mostly of intermediate composition magmas (andesite and dacite) with small amounts of higher-silica rhyolite erupted from numerous vents. Some thin rhyolite tuffs are attributed to more distant eruptions in the San Juan volcanic field. The precaldera rocks are mostly metaluminous (moderate in aluminum content) with a silica content ranging from 53% (basaltic andesite) to 67% (quartz latite). The rhyolites likely formed from fractionation of the original intermediate magmas.Johnson and Lipman 1988 The beginnings of regional extension at 26 Ma coincided with a transition to alkaline volcanism. Exposure of Amalia Tuff within the heavily eroded Questa caldera Ring dike of Questa Caldera exposed in Red River canyon The early volcanism was associated with the growth of a batholith in the upper crust beneath the field. The batholith broke through to the surface at 25 Ma and erupted some of peralkaline (alkali-rich) rhyolite ash flows to form an outflow sheet of densely welded Amalia Tuff. The emptied batholith collapsed to form the Questa caldera, which is at least across. The deep erosion of the caldera has made it a useful laboratory for understanding processes occurring below the surface in calderas. For example, fission track dating shows that the upper part of the batholith beneath the caldera had cooled to 100°C by a million years after emplacement and that uplift increased to the south. Bear Canyon Pluton of the Latir volcanic field, east of Questa, New Mexico, USA Magma continued to rise into the volcanic field, forming post-caldera batholiths that intrude both the caldera fill and the nearby pre-caldera volcanic and basement rocks. These intrusions likely drove resurgence of the caldera floor. All of these intrusions took place significantly later than the caldera eruption, with only the ring dike itself having an age comparable to the eruption,Tappa et al. 2011 and so cannot be part of the original magma chamber.Zimmerer and McIntosh 2012 The intrusions continued into the early Miocene, 22 million years ago. These were accompanied by postcaldera eruptions, but the postcaldera flows have been entirely eroded away except in the Timber and Brushy Mountains (), a small intrarift horst within the Rio Grande rift. The Latir volcanic field is the southern terminus of a southward migrating Tertiary magmatic locus that blanketed much of the southern Rocky Mountains with volcanic rock during the Eocene and Oligocene. It has been suggested that this migration of volcanic activity heated and weakened the lithosphere along its path to produce focuses for later extensional deformation of the eastern Cordillera. Magmatic sources The magmas erupted in the Latir volcanic field show isotopic chemistry indicating the magmas evolved in an open system, with crystal fractionation, magma mixing, and crustal assimilation all playing roles.Johnson et al. 1990 However, the precaldera rocks are overwhelmingly derived from basaltic magmas produced in the upper mantle, rather than melted crust. The precaldera intermediate-composition rocks likely were produced by mixing between fractionated magma and primitive basalt. This is reflected in unusually high nickel and magnesium contents and in the reverse zoning of hornblende and augite phenocrysts. Isotope data indicates that large amounts of melted crust were assimilated into the magmas, though only one set of flows contain xenocrysts typical of crustal melt. Crustal assimilation took place almost entirely in the deeper levels of the crust. The Amalia Tuff magma formed from a parent that was enriched in alkali metals and trace elements and had a large component of melted crust. Degassing of underlying volatile-rich alkali basalt may have transported enough alkali elements into the Amalia magma chamber to change the magma to a peralkaline composition. Fractional crystallization took place at an intermediate level of the crust before the final magma body formed at a relatively shallow level. Miocene lavas from the same region did not assimilate significant crust nor mix with primitive basalts, suggesting that these processes required large magma chambers fed by large flows of basaltic magma from the upper mantle. The Miocene magmas may reflect a time when the flow of basaltic magma had diminished or extensive faulting allowed the magma to erupt before it could pool in the subsurface. Fractionation of magma deep below the Latir field is estimated to have produced of new crust underneath the field. This may have been accompanied by delamination.MacCarthy et al. 2014 Sedimentation The growth of the Latir volcanic field produced enormous quantities of volcaniclastic sediments (Abiquiu Formation). Modeling suggests that these produced an alluvial fan that filled the adjacent basins of the newly opening Rio Grande rift and extended beyond the westernmost bounding faults of the rift. Both subsidence within the rift and flexural subsidence from the weight of the volcanic field contributed accommodation space for sediments, with flexural subsidence accounting for at least of accommodation space out to from the field. Another of accommodation was contributed by higher stream gradients, from the increasing elevation of the volcanic field and its contribution of a heavy load of sediments.Smith et al. 2002 Economic geology An outcrop of the Sulfur Gulch pluton near the Questa molybdenum mine, New Mexico, USA. Tailings pile of the Questa molybdenum mine, New Mexico, USA A rich molybdenum deposit along the Red River east of the town of Questa is related to the emplacement of the Sulfur Gulch post-caldera granitic pluton along the south margin of the Questa caldera at about 23 Ma. Minor molybdenum mineralization is also found in the Bear Canyon and Lucero Peak plutons. The underground Molycorp molybdenum mine exploited molybdenum mineralization under Goat Hill, which dominates the mouth of the Red River Canyon as seen from the town of Questa. The ore was emplaced by hot meteoric water circulating through fracture zones above the cooling plutons on the south margin of the Questa caldera, with the best deposits found where the Sulfur Gulch pluton meets precaldera andesite. The mineral zone is dominated by pyrite, alkali feldspar, fluorite, calcite, and quartz, with the chief molybdenum ore being molybdenite.Audétat et al. 2011 The ore zone is exposed at Sulfur Gulch, so named because the bright yellow molybenum-rich iron hydroxides weathered out of the ore veins was mistaken for sulfur. The ore itself was mistaken for graphite and use locally as a lubricant for wagon wheels. However, in 1916, prospector Jimmy Fay had a sample analyzed for precious metals and got back a report that the sample contained molybdenite, which was becoming highly prized for industrial uses. The Western Molybdenum Company was organized in La Jara and gathered up claims but did little to develop them. In November 1918, the R and S Molybdenum Company was organized in Denver, purchased seven Western Molybdenum Company claims, and filed additional claims. Production began in the spring of 1919 and ore was concentrated at a converted gold mill on the Red River above the mine.Schilling 1988 The Molybdenum Corporation of America acquired the property in 1920, and mining was almost continuous until 1971 except during the height of the Great Depression.The Taos News, 8 August 2014 The mine was unusual in that the molybdenite occurred as high-grade deposits in fissure veins rather than as low-grade disseminated ore. Total production by 1956 was 18,095,000 pounds of molybdenite. The mine was shut down \\"permanently\\" in 2014.

Background  In 1862, Guatemalan President Rafael Carrera revealed to his subordinates a plan to invade Salvadoran territory and overthrow Salvadoran President Gerardo Barrios, one of his rivals. The following year, 1863, Carrera invaded El Salvador and captured and devastated the local populations of Ahuachapán, Chalchuapa, and Santa Ana. On 13 February 1863, Barrios established his headquarters in the town of Jesús de los Milagros de Coatepeque anticipating that it would be Carrera's next target.  Order of battle = Salvadorans  The Salvadoran Army under Gerardo Barrios consisted of 4,000 infantry soldiers. The army also consisted of an artillery corps and one cavalry corps. Most of the soldiers were stationed on the San Pedro Malakoff hill while the rest were divided between the El Congo hill and the town of Coatepeque where Gerardo Barrios himself would wait for Carrera with his soldiers. The main road to Santa Ana was fortified with barricades and wooden palisades. A trench with defensive positions was also built on a hill near the Santa Ana Volcano with 150 men stationed there. The position was very removed from the main defenses but its positioning was critical since if it was captured, Carrera could outflank the defenders and reach the village from behind. The commanders of the Salvadoran Army were: *Gerardo Barrios – General Commander *José Trinidad Cabañas – Commander of the General Staff *Tomás Santander – Head of the Barrios Personal Guard *Domingo María Jehl – Vicar General *Horacio Parker – Commander of the Artillery Brigade *Alexandre Biscouby – Chief of the Artillery of San Pedro Malakoff *Alexandre Bassel – Chief of the Artillery of El Congo *Santiago González – Commander of the 1st Division *Rafael Osorio – Commander of the 2nd Division *Eusebio Bracamonte – Commander of the 3rd Division *Mariano Hernández – Commander of the 4th Division *Pedro Escalón – Commander of the 5th Division *Manuel Estévez – Commander of the Santa Ana Volcano Defenses  Guatemalans  The Guatemalan Army was larger than the Salvadoran Army. It was composed of 6,500 infantry soldiers. The attacking Guatemalans were better equipped than the Salvadorans with better artillery and better rifles. The commanders of the Guatemalan Army were: *Rafael Carrera – General Commander *Paul Brun – Commander of the Artillery *José Víctor Zavala – Commander of the 1st Division *Vicente Cerna Sandoval – Commander of the 2nd Division *Serapio Cruz – Commander of the 3rd Division  Battle  On 22 February, skirmishes began between the reconnaissance patrols of the two armies. On 23 February, there were several Guatemalan attacks on the Salvadoran positions on the San Pedro Malakoff hill. The attacks were all repelled by Biscouby's forces. Carrera gave the order for these assaults to stop since the attacks made no progress. The Guatemalans then dedicated themselves to bombarding the primary defending positions. At night the attacking Guatemalan troops managed to surround the San Pedro Malakoff hill and took the Salvadorans by surprise, but the attack was also repelled On 24 February, the Guatemalans attacked the two hills and the town itself with their entire army. While the Guatemalans were just about to capture a trench, a fire broke out and many soldiers fled. After the fire died down, the Guatemalans regrouped and attacked the town. The assault failed with Barrios himself defeating Carrera with his personal guard. After the attacks left hundreds dead, Carrera decided use his artillery to its maximum capacity, opening fire towards Coatepeque and the San Pedro Malakoff hill from a hill they occupied, however, the cannons did not do enough damage to the Salvadorans. At around 1 in the afternoon, the Guatemalans attempted a last attack to dislodge the Salvadorans, but a company under the command of Estanislao Pérez defeated them. General Santiago González and his division left their positions and attacked the Guatemalans head-on and managed to push them back a little before being surrounded. González's soldiers broke through the encirclement and returned to their positions. Meanwhile, General Eusebio Bracamonte attacked the Guatemalan rear which caused a panic in Carrera's entire army who began to flee. Carrera, seeing his strength dissipate, gave up and retreated from the battle field at around 5 in the afternoon. Upon seeing the Guatemalans retreat, González pursued the Carrera with cavalry to Jutiapa in Guatemala. The battle ended in a decisive Salvadoran victory.  Aftermath  Carrera was forced to withdraw and leave the cities of Santa Ana, Chalchuapa, and Ahuachapán as well as the other towns he had occupied. However, he again invaded El Salvador in June and directly besieged San Salvador and forced Gerardo Barrios to resign and flee the country on 26 October 1863.

The ship began to leak fuel oil in the following weeks, and broke apart in mid August. Although much of the oil on board Wakashio was pumped out before she broke in half, an estimated 1,000 tonnes of oil spilled into the ocean in what was called by some scientists the worst environmental disaster ever in Mauritius. Background MV Wakashio, a large capesize bulk carrier, was built by the Universal Shipbuilding Corporation of Tsu, Japan. She was laid down on 23 September 2004, launched on 9 March 2007, and was delivered on 30 May 2007. She had a deadweight tonnage of 203,000 tons, a length overall of , and a beam of . She was powered by a single diesel engine that gave her a service speed of . The ship belonged to Okiyo Maritime Corp., an associate company of Nagashiki Shipping Co. Ltd., and was operated by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines. At the time of her grounding, Wakashio was flying under a Panamanian flag of convenience, despite her Japanese ownership. The ship was sailing without cargo, and departed from Lianyungang, China on 4 July, stopped in Singapore, and was scheduled to reach Tubarão, Brazil on 13 August. A crew of 20 was on board, none of whom were injured. Japan's ClassNK inspection body said in a statement on 11 August that the ship had passed an annual inspection in March. Mitsui OSK said they doubted whether the incident would have a significant effect on their earnings.  Incident  IMO workers in hazmat suits stand in surf near the wreck on August 13, 2020 Wakashio ran aground on a coral reef on 25 July, but did not immediately begin leaking oil. Oil began to leak from the ship on 6 August, by which time Mauritius authorities were trying to control the spill and minimize its effects, isolating environmentally sensitive areas of the coast, while waiting for help from foreign countries to pump out an estimated 3,890 tons of oil remaining on board. By 10 August, about 1,000 metric tons of fuel had spilled, with estimates of the remaining oil onboard ranging from 2,500 to 3,000 metric tons. High winds and waves halted cleanup efforts on 10 August; visible cracks in the hull of the ship led to worries that the ship might \\"break in two,\\" according to Mauritius' prime minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth. Jugnauth said that 3,000 tons of oil had been pumped out of the ship's fuel reservoirs. Data from Finnish Iceye satellites indicated the spill had increased from on 6 August to on 11 August. The ship broke up on 15 August when there were still 166 tons of fuel inside. Waves high hindered cleanup. After she split, Wakashio's bow section was towed into the open ocean and scuttled on 24 August. Recovery operations continued around the stern section, which remained aground, and on 31 August a tugboat working on the wreck sank after colliding with a barge in heavy weather, killing at least three crewmembers. According to investigators who conducted interviews with crew members, the crew had been celebrating the birthday of a sailor on board the ship at the time of the grounding, had sailed near shore for a wi-fi signal. However, local police denied reports that the ship had sailed close to land seeking a Wi-Fi signal, saying that looking for a phone signal would not have required sailing so close to land. The ship then failed to respond to warnings of the errant course. The ship's captain, Capt. Sunil Kumar Nandeshwar, 58, an Indian national, and deputy captain outsourced by HK shipmanagement company Anglo Eastern were arrested on 18 August on suspicion of negligence in operating the vessel. The grounding happened at an area which is listed under the Ramsar convention on wetlands of international importance and near the marine park of Blue Bay. Tourism plays a major role in the economy of Mauritius, accounting for about 63 billion Mauritian rupees (US$1.59 billion) in spending in 2019, and is centered around marine scenery and animals likely to be endangered by the oil spill. Greenpeace stated that \\"[t]housands of species [...] are at risk of drowning in a sea of pollution, with dire consequences for Mauritius’ economy, food security and health.\\"  Aftermath = Cleanup Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth declared a \\"state of environmental emergency\\" and requested French help on 7 August. \\"When biodiversity is in peril, there is urgency to act,\\" French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted, \\"France is there. Alongside the people of Mauritius. You can count on our support dear Jugnauth.\\" France sent both military and civilian equipment and personnel from its overseas territory of Réunion. Local volunteers joined forces to remedy the situation by making cloth barriers stuffed with straw and human hair. Japan sent a six-member crew of specialists to help in the cleanup. On 11 August 2020 Indian Oil Mauritius Ltd (IOML) started to evacuate oil from the breached vessel onto the IOML barge Tresta Star, which had a capacity to hold 1,000 tonnes of oil. India has sent 30 tonnes of technical equipment and material to the country to help contain the oil spill as well as a 10-member team of the Indian Coast Guard specialising in containing oil spills. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said the spill \\"risks bringing devastating consequences for the economy, food security, health and tourism industry.\\" The group also reminded countries about the importance of international legal instruments such as the HNS Convention for liability and compensation. Spilled oil is being collected and loaded onto barges for handling in Port Louis. On 31 August, a fatal accident occurred during a squall when the tug collided with its barge and subsequently sank; three of the eight-person crew were killed and one more is missing.  Anti-government protests  Port Louis protest (31 August 2020) Perceived failure of the government to respond promptly and effectively has resulted in protests. In Mauritius, 150 000 protesters assembled in the capital Port Louis, focusing on the Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth, including calls for the prime minister to step down. The Prime Minister has denied any responsibility. International protests, primarily led by Mauritian diaspora, also occurred in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg, Germany, and the UK. The government has suspended the parliament, and has been accused of suppressing local media and preventing independent reporting regarding the incident, drawing sharp rebuke. Additionally, the government has been criticised for delegating critical decision-making to faceless and unaccountable 'advisors'.  Calls for shipping industry reform  The oil spill has, along with the 2020 Beirut explosion, brought into sharp contrast failures of the shipping industry, with critics highlighting lax attitude to operational safety. Pope Francis called for increased environmental care to address and prevent such disasters in the future. Shipping industry commentators and publications have also called for self-reflection by the stakeholders, including supporting the calls for increased shipping industry financial responsibility when it comes to disaster response and cleanup. Environmental damage Pointe d'Esny beach before the oil spill Oceanographer and environmental engineer Vassen Kauppaymuthoo said, \\"Around a little bit less than 50 percent of this lagoon is covered by environmentally sensitive areas, be it corals, be it seagrass, be it mangroves, be it entire mudflats, sand beaches and dunes, which is huge. Which confirms the sensitivity of this lagoon, in terms of oil spill.\\" Ecotoxicologist Christopher Goodchild from Oklahoma State University said, \\"With this oil spill it looks like there is infiltration out of the mangroves, so you have the oily substance that can bind to organic matter or dirt and start to settle in and just being able to remove that toxic sediment can be a real challenge.\\" Flakes of the damaged anti-fouling coating on the hull can also poison the marine fauna and flora on the reef and surroundings in a similar fashion to what occurred on the Great Barrier Reef. Reuters quoted unnamed scientists as saying that the spill was likely the worst environmental incident in the history of Mauritius, with effects possibly lingering for decades. From 6 to 11 August, the spill expanded to over . The island's environment minister Kavy Ramano, together with the fisheries minister, told the press that it was the first time that the country faced a catastrophe of this magnitude, and that they were insufficiently equipped to handle the problem. Many dead sea mammals washed up on local beaches in the days following the spill, and more have been found seriously ill. Among the dead animals are dolphins and melon-headed whales. Compensation and cleanup funding Mauritius requested compensation for the spill from Wakashio owner Nagashiki Shipping, which according to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage is responsible for oil damage. The ruling treaty for the circumstances of the incident is the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, which prescribes a maximum payout of 2 billion Japanese yen in the original draft to which Mauritius is a signatory, and 7 billion yen according to a 1996 amendment signed by Japan. Wakashio is insured by the Japanese P&I; Club for up to US$1 billion; the agency said it expected to pay at least some portion of the cost of the recovery effort. On 2 September 2020, Mauritius also asked Japan to pay $34 million in reparations for the disaster; the island nation demanded the money to \\"support local fishermen whose livelihoods were adversely impacted by an oil leak last month\\", according to a Mauritian government document. The ship's operator/charterer, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, pledged 1 billion (about US$9.4 million). The Mauritius Natural Environment Recovery Fund will \\"fund environmental projects and support the local fishing community\\". The president of MOL cited the payment as their \\"social responsibility\\" while apologizing for the damage. MOL also expects that ship owner Nagashiki Shipping will contribute to the Fund.

Easy Peak is situated in North Cascades National Park, and is often climbed during the Easy Ridge approach to Mount Challenger and the remote northern Pickets. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mineral Mountain, to the west, and Whatcom Peak is set to the east. Glacierets line the north slope of Easy Ridge between Easy Peak and Whatcom Peak. Precipitation runoff from this peak drains north into the Chilliwack River, or south into headwaters of the Baker River. Climate Easy Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Easy Peak centered, from north The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The “U”-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

This Act was construed as one with the Electricity (Supply) Acts 1882 to 1933, and was cited as the Electricity (Supply) Acts 1882 to 1935. It authorised the Central Electricity Board to make arrangements with owners of generating stations that were not selected stations; it authorised the Central Electricity Board to supply electricity directly to railway companies; and amended Sections 11 and 12 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926.  Background  The Central Electricity Board had been established by Section 1 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926. Its duties (Section 2) included the identification of selected electricity generating stations, generally those that could produce electricity at the lowest cost. There were a number of marginal stations for which the price the Central Electricity Board was able to offer was still not below the working costs. Agreements were reached for these stations to take a supply from the board bringing the station under grid control. These agreements were ultra vires and were retrospectively sanctioned by section 1 of the 1935 Act. Section 11 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1919 had prohibited railway companies from building generating stations unless they could demonstrate that electricity undertakers could not provide a supply at an equivalent or lesser cost. Railway companies had to negotiate with multiple undertakings along the route of their tracks. With the construction of the National Grid (1927–33) these arrangements had become wasteful and impracticable. Section 3 of the 1935 Act address this issue and permitted the Central Electricity Board to supply in bulk to railway companies. The Central Electricity Board had, in some cases, offered long term concessions to undertakings to undercut private generation. These arrangements were retrospectively permitted by Section 2 of the 1935 Act.  Provisions of the Act  The Electricity (Supply) Act 1935 received royal assent on 12 February 1935. Its long title was ‘An Act to authorise the Central Electricity Board to make certain arrangements with authorised undertakers who are the owners of, or control, generating stations which are not selected stations; to authorise the Central Electricity Board to supply electricity directly to railway companies for certain purposes; to amend sections eleven and twelve of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.’ The Act comprised four sections as follows. Section 1 (1) gave the Central Electricity Board the power to enter into agreements concerning operation with the owners or operators of generating stations that are not selected stations. Such agreements include regulating the manner in which the station is operated and maintained and including supplying electricity to the board and taking a supply from the board. Section 1 (2) required the Electricity Commissioners to inquire into the working of past arrangements to which Section 1 (1) applies, to ensure that arrangements did not entail a financial loss to the Board. Section 2 gave the Central Electricity Board the power to supply electricity to authorised undertakers at a price and a tariff specified by Section 11 of the 1926 Act. Section 3 specified the price to be charged by authorised undertakers for electricity supplied to railway companies. It gave the Electricity Commissioners the power to specify the charges and allowances to be included in the price to be charged. Section 4 gave the Central Electricity Board the power to supply electricity directly to railway companies. Section 5 defines the short title, citation, interpretation and extent of the Act. The Act did not extend to Northern Ireland.  Operation of the Act  The provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Acts 1882 to 1935 remained un-amended until the nationalisation of the industry under the Electricity Act 1947.  Later Acts  The Electricity Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo. 6, c. 54), nationalised the UK electricity supply industry. The Electricity Commissioners, the power companies, and the joint electricity authorities were abolished. The ownership of electricity generation and transmission facilities was vested in the British Electricity Authority.

The subject heading became a topic of political interest in the United States in 2016, when a decision by the Library of Congress to revise the heading and replace it with the terms \\"unauthorized immigration\\" and \\"noncitizens\\" was opposed by congressional Republicans. Background The Library of Congress Subject Heading (LCSH) \\"Aliens, Illegal\\" was established by the Library of Congress (LC) in 1980 and revised to \\"Illegal aliens\\" in 1993. The subject heading incorporates references from non-preferred forms of the term including \\"Aliens --Legal status, laws, etc.\\"; \\"Aliens, Illegal\\"; \\"Illegal aliens--Legal status, laws, etc.\\"; \\"Illegal immigrants\\"; \\"Illegal immigration\\"; and \\"Undocumented aliens\\". It also references related terms such as \\"Alien detention centers\\" and \\"Human smuggling.\\" Associated headings include \\"Children of illegal aliens\\" and \\"Women illegal aliens.\\" In this context, alien is a legal term meaning a person who is not a citizen or national of a given country. Attempts to revise heading and backlash In 2010, racial justice organization Race Forward debuted a campaign to \\"Drop the I-Word,\\" an effort to ask media sources to no longer use the word \\"illegal\\" when referring to undocumented immigrants, arguing that using the word to describe people was dehumanizing, racially charged, and legally inaccurate. Multiple news outlets stopped using \\"illegal\\" to describe people in the early 2010s, including the Associated Press. Student activists at Dartmouth College, including the Dartmouth Coalition for Immigration Reform, Equality and DREAMERs (CoFIRED), issued a series of racial justice demands to the Dartmouth administration in February 2014, one of which requested the term \\"Illegal aliens\\" not be used in the library's catalog. Together with Dartmouth librarians, the students from CoFIRED submitted a formal request to LC in the summer of 2014 for the heading to be revised to \\"Undocumented immigrants\\". In February 2015, LC announced it would not change the heading, in part because resources such as Black's Law Dictionary used \\"Illegal aliens\\" as an established term. Librarian activists continued to gather support to ask LC to revise the heading. The Council of the American Library Association passed a resolution in January 2016 calling the term \\"dehumanizing, offensive, inflammatory, and even a racial slur\\" and urging the Library of Congress to change the subject heading to \\"Undocumented immigrants\\". In March 2016, LC announced that it would replace the heading with two new headings: \\"Noncitizens\\" and \\"Unauthorized immigration\\". Following that announcement, Republican lawmakers made multiple attempts to block the revision of the subject heading, including the introduction of a bill by U.S. Representative Diane Black requiring the Library to retain the heading. In June 2016, the House of Representatives added a provision to the 2017 appropriations bill for the legislative branch requiring LC to retain the heading without revision. While the final bill did not require LC to keep the \\"Illegal aliens\\" heading, it did require LC \\"to make publicly available its process for changing or adding subject headings\\". The Library of Congress has made no announcement regarding the heading since May 2016. Further developments Change the Subject is a 2019 documentary focusing on the efforts of the Dartmouth students in petitioning for changing the \\"Illegal aliens\\" subject heading. It has been screened throughout the U.S. More than forty libraries and library systems have enacted changes to this subject heading in their own library systems.

Jewish law requires prayers thrice a day. Christian denominations like the Oriental Orthodox church pray at canonical hours seven times a day. Muslims pray five times a day, with the timings determined by daily astronomical phenomena.  Judaism  Jews stop to pray Maariv (evening prayer) while at a Tel Aviv flea-market shop Jewish law requires Jews to pray thrice a day; the morning prayer is known as Shacharit, the afternoon prayer is known as Mincha, and the evening prayer is known as Maariv. According to Jewish tradition, the prophet Abraham introduced Shacharit, the prophet Isaac introduced Mincha, and the prophet Jacob introduced Maariv. Jews historically prayed in the direction of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, where the \\"presence of the transcendent God (shekinah) [resided] in the Holy of Holies of the Temple\\". In the Bible, it is written that when the prophet Daniel was in Babylon, he \\"went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open to Jerusalem; and he got down upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously\\" (cf. ). After its destruction, Jews continue to pray facing Jerusalem in hope for the coming of the Messiah whom they await.  Christianity  From the time of the early Church, the practice of seven fixed prayer times have been taught. In Apostolic Tradition, Hippolytus instructed Christians to pray seven times a day, \\"on rising, at the lighting of the evening lamp, at bedtime, at midnight\\" and \\"the third, sixth and ninth hours of the day, being hours associated with Christ's Passion.\\" Christians attended the liturgy on the Lord's Day, worshipping communally in both the morning and evening. They prayed privately throughout the rest of the week, with the exception of Christian monastics who gathered for prayer corporately. This practice of seven fixed prayer times was done in the bodily positions of prostration and standing, which continues today in some Christian denominations, especially those of Oriental Christianity. Oriental Orthodox Christians (such as Copts and Indians), as well as members of the Mar Thoma Syrian Church (an Oriental Protestant denomination), use a breviary such as the Agpeya and Shehimo to pray the canonical hours seven times a day while facing in the eastward direction, in anticipation of the Second Coming of Jesus; this Christian practice has its roots in , in which the prophet David prays to God seven times a day. In the Indian Christian and Syriac Christian tradition, these canonical hours are known as Vespers (Ramsho [6 pm]), Compline (Soutoro [9 pm]), Nocturns (Lilio [12 am]), Matins (Sapro [6 am]), 3rd hour prayer (Tloth sho\`in [9 am]), 6th hour prayer (Sheth sho\`in [12 pm]), and 9th hour prayer (Tsha' sho\`in [3 pm]). In the Coptic Christian and Ethiopian Christian tradition, these seven canonical hours are known as the First Hour (Prime [6 am]), the Third Hour (Terce [9 am]), the Sixth Hour (Sext [12 pm]), the Ninth Hour (None [3 pm]), the Eleventh Hour (Vespers [6 pm]), the Twelfth Hour (Compline [9 pm]), and the Midnight office [12 am]; monastics pray an additional hour known as the Veil. Church bells are tolled at these hours to enjoin the faithful to Christian prayer. Those who are unable to pray canonical hour of a certain fixed prayer time may recite the Qauma, in the Indian Orthodox tradition. In Western Christianity and Eastern Orthodox Christianity, the practice of praying the canonical hours at fixed prayer times became mainly observed by monastics and clergy, though today, the Catholic Church encourages the laity to pray the Liturgy of the Hours and in the Lutheran Churches and Anglican Communion, breviaries such as The Brotherhood Prayer Book and the Anglican Breviary, respectively, are used to pray the Daily Office; the Methodist tradition has emphasized the praying of the canonical hours as an \\"essential practice\\" in being a disciple of Jesus. Many Christians have historically hung a Christian cross the eastern wall of their houses, which they face during these seven fixed prayer times. Before praying, Oriental Orthodox Christians and Oriental Protestant Christians wash their hands, face and feet in order to be clean before and present their best to God; shoes are removed in order to acknowledge that one is offering prayer before a holy God. In these Christian denominations, and in many others as well, it is customary for women to wear a Christian headcovering when praying.  Islam  local time, the Muslim prayer times differ by locations and change from day to day. Muslims pray five times a day, with their prayers being known as Fajr (dawn), Dhuhr (after midday), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (sunset), Isha (nighttime), facing towards Mecca. The direction of prayer is called the qibla; the early Muslims initially prayed in the direction of Jerusalem before this was changed to Mecca in 624 CE, about a year after Muhammad's migration to Medina. The timing of the five prayers are fixed intervals defined by daily astronomical phenomena. For example, the Maghrib prayer can be performed at any time after sunset and before the disappearance of the red twilight from the west. In a mosque, the muezzin broadcasts the call to prayer at the beginning of each interval. Because the start and end times for prayers are related to the solar diurnal motion, they vary throughout the year and depend on the local latitude and longitude when expressed in local time. In modern times, various religious or scientific agencies in Muslim countries produce annual prayer timetables for each locality, and electronic clocks capable of calculating local prayer times have been created. In the past, some mosques employed astronomers called the muwaqqits who were responsible for regulating the prayer time using mathematical astronomy. The five intervals were defined by Muslim authorities in the decades after the death of Muhammad in 632, based on the hadith (the reported sayings and actions) of the Islamic prophet. According to Justin Paul Heinz, the five fixed prayer times in Islamic prayer were likely influenced by the canonical hours of Oriental Orthodox Christians (who were regarded as Monophysites) in the 4th century who prayed seven times a day, given the extensive contact that Muhammad and his companions had with Syrian Christian monks. Abu Bakr and other early followers of Muhammad were exposed to these fixed times of prayer of the Syrian Christians in Abyssinia and likely relayed their observations to Muhammad, \\"placing the potential for Christian influence directly within the Prophet’s circle of followers and leaders.\\"  See also  *Ad orientem *Breviary *Cantharus *Cross necklace *Direction of prayer *Daily devotional *Mealtime Prayer *Home altar *Hygiene in Christianity *Prayer book Notes References  External links  *Shehimo - Indian Orthodox Christian prayer times *Agpeya - Coptic Christian prayer times *Salah - Islamic prayer times Category:Jewish behaviour and experience Category:Christian prayer Category:Salat Category:Time in religion ","title":"Fixed prayer times"},{"id":"64783280","text":"The 1946 United States Air Force C-47 crash, known in China as the April 8 Incident, was the crash of US Army Air Force C-47B-1-DL (registration 43-16360) from Chongqing to Yan'an that struck a mountain in Shaanxi, China, killing all four crew members and 13 passengers, including several top Communist Chinese leaders. Background Following the end of World War II, the Kuomintang government of China and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) commenced negotiations for a political settlement to form a joint government. During WWII, the US Air Force set up operations at Chongqing, including the Flying Tigers units that fought Japanese forces in China. The US military remained in Chongqing after the end of the war, and US government agents were instrumental in organizing negotiations between the Kuomintang and CCP. In order to facilitate these negotiations, the US Air Force flew CCP representatives between the Communist headquarters at Yan'an in Shaanxi province to Chongqing.

In October 1967 for instance, a recruitment visit by Dow Chemicals, which supplied napalm to the military, was interrupted by protests. The Harvard Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs drew particular attention, with sit-ins disrupting their meetings. Although the faculty was willing to reduce the programs’ privileges, the Harvard Corporation refused to terminate it. These developments, alongside the creation of a degree program in Afro-American studies, led to the events of April 1969. On the night of April 8 to 9, a group of about 300 students, led by the SDS, tacked a list of demands on the door of home of Nathan Pusey, then President of Harvard. Not only did it call for the abolition of ROTC, but also for lower rent and student involvement in designing the curriculum for the Afro-American studies degree. The demands were later rejected by Pusey as baseless. At noon on April 9, a group of 30 to 70 students entered University Hall, ejecting administrative staff and faculty. While most left the building peacefully, some faculty like assistant dean Archie Epps were forcefully expelled. At 4:15pm Harvard Yard was closed off by the administration, citing safety concerns. The occupiers were threatened with criminal prosecution and disciplinary action if they did not leave until 4:30. The Boston Globe estimated the number of students inside University Hall to now be about 500, with at least 3000 onlookers in the Yard. At 5pm, a meeting between moderate students and Dean Fred Glimp was convened at Lowell Lecture Hall, both agreeing on a peaceful resolution of the conflict. At 10pm on April 9, Pusey decided to call in city and state police for help. At 4:45am that night, the mayor of Cambridge, Walter Sullivan, warned the occupiers to leave, before sending over 400 police officers in at 5am. Estimates on the number of people arrested vary between 100, 196, and 300. Amongst them were a number of press people, who got released immediately. At least 75 persons were injured, of which about 50 were treated at hospitals. Most of those arrested were charged with trespassing, of whom around 170 were fined twenty dollars. Three were charged with assault and battery, and two were sentenced to nine months in jail. Robert Tonis, chief of the Harvard University Police, believing the police intervention to be unwarranted, spoke with the occupiers, apologising for the actions of the police. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences were quick to condemn the intervention of the police, while also criticising the occupation. A number of students were expelled, some of them without the possibility of reapplication. The reaction of the press was mixed: While most were critical of the occupation, some outlets like Newsweek said that faculty and students should have been consulted before police were called in. In the aftermath of the occupation, a series of reforms began. The ROTC lost the privileges not held by other extracurricular activities by a vote of the faculty. The Harvard Corporation later endorsed that vote. Student representatives got a role in the appointment of faculty for Afro-American studies.  Harvard Square Riots  After the Students for a Democratic Society fractured in 1970, multiple groups emerged from the Harvard chapter, the more conservative of which was the November Action Coalition. It secured a permit to organize a parade on April 15 1970, protesting the trial of Black Panther leader Bobby Seale, as well as being part of a broader anti-war effort. The date was significant, because the rally also protested against using tax money for war efforts and it was the final day to file Federal income tax reports. The march to Harvard Yard was described by the New York Times as largely peaceful, with rocks being thrown sporadically. A sound truck encouraged participants to “go all the way to Harvard Square – where the enemies are”. The number of protesters was estimated to be around 1500 by the time they entered Harvard Square at 7pm. At 7:20pm, the street lights were turned off and police formed a line, wearing masks and no badges. Some protesters started rioting, throwing bricks, smashing windows, setting fires and taunting Harvard University students watching from their dormitories. While two buildings and two police cars were set on fire, fire trucks were able to quickly extinguish these. The roughly 2,000 police officers present started charging the protesters at 8:19pm, firing tear gas and occasionally throwing back bricks thrown at them. The streets were cleared at about 1am and the 2,000 National Guard soldiers who were standing by at their Boston and Cambridge armouries dismissed at 2am. A curfew imposed that evening was lifted at 6am. At least 314 people were treated for injuries at hospitals, including 35 policemen. 70 of those injuries were serious lacerations or bone fractures. The damages were estimated at 100,000$ by the Cambridge city manager James L. Sullivan. Harvard University officials maintained that few Harvard students were involved and promised to provide legal assistance to any students arrested.  1970: Bombing of the Harvard Semitic Museum  The Harvard Semitic Museum, now the Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East, housed the Center for International Affairs (CFIA) on the top floors of its building. It provided economic advisory to developing countries and conducted research on international issues, but it was accused by the Students for a Democratic Society in 1965 as supporting the anti-Communist regime in Indonesia. Henry Kissinger was an Associate Director at the Center, but was working as Richard Nixon’s National Security Advisor at the time of the bombing. These factors made the CFIA and by extension the building in which it was housed a prime target for anti-war groups. On October 14, 1970, a few minutes after 1am, a bomb placed in the desk of an Army colonel visiting Harvard for independent study, exploded on the third floor of the museum. Roughly 25 minutes early, a woman telephoned a warning to the Harvard Police. No one was in the building at that time. In a letter sent to Boston news outlets the following day, the Proud Eagle Tribe claimed responsibility, describing themselves as a group of \\"revolutionary women\\" aiming to destroy \\"Amerikan [sic] imperialism\\". Museum staff had seen two unidentified young women in the building about 4 pm the day before the bombing. The FBI investigated but the case was not solved.

As governor he tried to keep his office independent, but he was restricted from pursuing his own policies and was only dependent on Baghdad. Al-Anbari regarded himself as the advocate of the people; while judging a case involving the caliph, he reportedly remained in his seat when the caliph entered the court. In the year 783 AD, under the succeeding caliph al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), al-Anbari was removed from his office as a governor of Basra by the order of the caliph. According to Tarikh Baghdad by al-Khatib al- Baghdadi, al-Anbari was dismissed because he refused an order from the caliph al-Mahdi to find in favor for a military leader against a merchant in a case.

He attracted a broad range of Evangelical Anglicans to his church where he preached about \\"prophetical questions\\" having closely studied the Book of Revelation. This included his speculations that the Roman Catholic Church would unite with the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church of England to become the Antichrist. In 1867 he left London for Ipswich where he was appointed the minister for St Margaret's Church by the Simeon's Trustees, an Evangelical Anglican organisation. In 1881 he was appointed as an honorary canon at Norwich Cathedral. He gave up his benefice in 1895, but remained active, sharing his understanding of the prophetical aspects of the Christian scriptures with the readers of the The Times of London until shortly before his death.

According to Fars News Agency, this documentary series is divided into four chapters entitled \\"Secret of Armageddon\\", \\"Secret of Armageddon 2: Army of Shadows\\", \\"Secret of Armageddon 3: Temple of Darkness\\" and \\"Secret of Armageddon 4: Ghost Project\\" and, were broadcast from the News channel, IRIB TV1 and IRIB TV3 of IRIB during 2008 to 2010. The fourth part of the series, entitled Ghost Project, caused the program to be criticized at the Hebrew University of Tel Aviv in Israel. The Secret of Armageddon 4 (Ghost Project) According to the producers, the documentary series \\"The Secret of Armageddon 4: The Ghost Project\\" is based on domestic and foreign documents which shows the role of hidden Zionist centers in using the media (including press, radio, TV, Internet, cinema and computer games) in the soft war against Islam, Iran and the Islamic Revolution. The series also depicts the emergence of \\"new quasi-mystical and polytheistic sects\\" to destroy the minds of the younger generation and turn them away from monotheistic and Abrahamic religions. Summary of episodes=Episode 10 (Media Pluralism) It is about publications after the Islamic Revolution (except Kayhan, Islamic Republic, Resalat) and states that they are affiliated with Masonic and Zionist circles and follow the command of ideological collapse which underlies the physical collapse. And Americans, Europeans, and Zionist foundations are the financial and intellectual supporters of these publications. Episode 11 (Shock Corridor) This section is dedicated to the destruction of the BBC and states that this media has a direct connection with the spy apparatus, the Baháʼí Faith, and the Zionist centers. Episode 12 (Attack of Waves) In this section, all satellite channels are considered as Zionist-American channels whose goal is to overthrow the Islamic Regime in Iran. Episode 13 (Internet) This section refers to large IT companies such as Facebook and Microsoft; generally, the Internet is the product of the Pentagon within the digital Cold War (or the Zionist-Crusade war) and all of which are affiliated with Zionism. The trafficking of some 800,000 women and girls from east to west is a crime and corruption caused by the Internet. Episodes 15, 16 and 18 (re-reading the history of Iranian cinema) This section re-reads Iran's cinema, stating that the cinema in Iran was formed by the Zionists and Freemasons and that the first circle of cinemas in Iran was created by graduates of the Zionist schools of the Alliance (Israeli International Union). Episode 19 (Zionist sects) In this part, it is said that the Zionists have tried to stand against the holy savior of the Islamic world by producing parallel and false saviors. According to the producers of this collection, the Bábism and Baháʼí Faith sects have emerged in this way. Medias such as BBC and VOA are also propagandists, and Ali Mohammad Bab (founder of Babism) is affiliated with the global empire of Zionism. There is also a picture of a letter from Mohammad Ali Bab, which is referred to as a picture of Ali Mohammad Bab's humiliating repentance letter and is a document of his illiteracy. Episode 20 (Coup d'état Terrorists) This section addresses the issue of the Baháʼí Faith and states that the Baháʼís have been responsible for the anti-Iranian and anti-Islamic events of the past two centuries and they have had close ties to Constitutionalists through Britain. This issue is mentioned in the statement \\"a terrible terrorist, espionage, coup d'etat and destructive operation of Baha'i sect\\". Episode 21(Dream of the Promised Land) This section describes the continuation of the Baháʼí crimes and their relationship to Israel, the CIA, and SAVAK, and their efforts to conquer Iran as a Promised Land. Episode 22(secular dervishes) This section refers to the subject of informal (non-governmental) Shiite mysticism, in which it is stated that these mysticisms were created by the Zionist centers, and the Sufism and Dervishes are made by Zionists and Freemasons.\\" Episode 24 (Emerging Mysticism) The producers of this episode deal with mystics and sects founded by Dalai Lama, Sai Baba, Krishna Morti and Ashu, etc. which are promoted by the facilities of the Zionist and Freemasonry intelligence agencies and are all corrupt, leading to moral perversions and most of them intend to stand against the idea of Intidhar of the Shiites (waiting for emerging of 12th Imam). All these false mystics (as the episode states) want to follow the same evil idea of conquering the earth that is desirable to the Zionists. Episodes 25 and 26 (Anarchist Mysticisms (Elia, Paulo Coelho, etc.) and Zionist conspiracies against Dhohor) Episodes 25 and 26 of this series were rebroadcast several times on IRIB in February 2011. It says that Elia Ramallah (founder of El-Yasin community) claims to be a god and he has misled the Iranian youth. Paolo Coelho has anti-divine, polytheistic, and corrupt ideas and, of course, is dependent on Israel and his works are toward stabilization of Israel, and he is moral corruption, Satanist, Zionist and addict. The episode also deals with Shimon Peres (former Prime Minister of Israel and one of the founders of New Zionism) and the Aknkar movement. And Satanism is considered as a Zionist sect that is also associated with the CIA, and this organization tries to identify Sahib al- Zaman (12th Imam of Shias) and assassinate him and create obstacles for his emergence. Next, the creators of the collection (from Kayhan Research Institute) have tried to direct the viewers' minds towards their desired project by adding a section on Satanism (as the most prominent aspect of Judaism). The film emphasizes that \\"American presidents, their foreign ministers, European presidents, and even the pope are Satanists.\\" These two episodes, which seem to be the culmination and focus point of its creators, were repeated many times. The last time (until September 2011) coinciding with the 9/11 anniversary, was broadcast by Jam-e-Jam 1, 2, and 3 satellite channels (only episode 25 and 26). Reactions to the broadcasting of this series The program was reviewed at the University of Tel Aviv in 2009 and noted its effectiveness. In addition, the annual report of the Israel Terrorism Intelligence Center in 2008 and 2009 read about this serial: \\"This collection tries to follow Iran's anti-Zionist tendencies and tries to reflect the demands of the Islamic revolution against Israel in the world.\\" The IRIB News channel's website wrote about the effectiveness of this series: \\"It is enough that Tel Aviv University in Zionist Regime, by analyzing 105 episodes of 'The Secret of Armageddon' declares that the series has been successful in achieving its goals because 25,000 websites have used this TV program, and Tel Aviv University warns about it as a great danger.\\" References Category:2000s Iranian television series Category:2008 Iranian television series debuts ","title":"The Secret of Armageddon"},{"id":"64783735","text":"Prakash Raj (born 11 June 1998 in Singapore) is a Singaporean footballer.Prakash Raj: Young Lions are capable of winning even though we are young foxsports.ph References Category:Singaporean footballers Category:Living people Category:1998 births Category:Association football defenders Category:Young Lions FC players ","title":"Prakash Raj (footballer)"},{"id":"64783760","text":"Nazhiim Harman (born 2 March 1999 in Singapore) is a Singaporean footballer.Collarbone fracture steers Dollah Kassim Award nominee Nazhiim towards football tnp.sg References Category:Association football defenders Category:Living people Category:Singaporean footballers Category:1999 births Category:Young Lions FC players ","title":"Nazhiim Harman"},{"id":"64783764","title":"Magkano ang Iyong Dangal?"},{"id":"64783815","text":"Arturo Reyes can refer to: * Arturo Reyes (writer) (1864-1913), Spanish writer * Arturo Reyes (footballer) (born 1969), Colombian football manager and former footballer ","title":"Arturo Reyes"},{"id":"64783823","text":"Nguyễn Hằng Tcheuko Minh (born as Benoit Elmakoua Tcheuko; born 18 August 1983 in Cameroon) is a Cameroonian retired footballer.Cầu thủ nhập tịch Nguyễn Hằng Tcheuko Minh: Đoạn kết buồn & con đường tù tội bondsplus.vn References Category:Cameroonian footballers Category:Living people category:Association football midfielders Category:1983 births Category:CLB Đồng Tháp players ","title":"Nguyễn Hằng Tcheuko Minh"},{"id":"64783835","text":"New Glasgow Cubs in 1912–13.

Life Mosse was born in Ireland but the actual location and date is unknown. She was the daughter of Joseph Rouviere, Esquire of Dublin. She moved to London with her mother in about 1802 or 1803. Her first novel, Lussington Abbey, was published anonymously in 1804. The following year she married Isaac Mosse, who was about 40 years old, in London. The wedding was on 4 December 1806 in St Marylebone. Her mother died the following year. Her 1807 novel, A Peep at our Ancestors, is one of her best known. It was a romantic novel set in the 12th century including explanatory footnotes. Mosse complained that this book should have appeared in 1805 and blamed the difficulties of dealing with the publishers from Ireland and the death of her supporter the Duke of Leinster. The novel was said to be based on documents but there seems little evidence of research. Her book Heirs of Villeroy the year before had good reviews and in 1808 The Old Irish Baronet, or, The Manners of my Country followed. The latter was based on a 1788 gothic story, The Old English Baron, by Clara Reeve. In 1814 her husband had his book Enclytica, Being the Outlines of a Course of Instruction on the Principles of Universal Grammar published. In 1822 her husband suffered paralysing strokes. He had lost his money in a swindle a few years before and they now relied on the novels that Mosse published and the patronage of Louisa Gordon, Marchioness Cornwallis. During the 1820s she published four novels. A Father's Love and a Woman's Friendship in 1825, Gratitude and other Tales in 1826, Woman's Wit and Man's Wisdom, or, Intrigue the following year and in 1829 The Blandfords, or, Fate and Fortune. Her novels were a poor income and she seemed unable to find other writing work. Her husband's single publication enabled her to make appeals to the Royal Literary Fund and they were of assistance to them but the last successful appeal was from the \\"side of his coffin\\". She told the fund that she had written plays but she suspected that although she had some encouragement she felt it would need a man to persuade a company to perform them. Her work 'The distress of women was also mentioned in her 1830 appeal to the fund. She published most of her novels at the Minerva Press. Mosse died in London in poverty in 1834. An appeal on her behalf for funds for her funeral were turned down by the Royal Literary Fund who noted that she was living in \\"great destitution in a miserable attic\\".

In a crime spree lasting nearly two years across three states, Newman committed four murders and a dozen bank robberies prior to his capture at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for his crimes and imprisoned at Jessup Correctional Institution, where he was found dead in his cell in 2000. Early life Little is known about Newman's early life and upbringing. A native of Wheaton, Maryland, he attended Virginia Tech in the 1970s and 1980s, but failed to earn a degree, earning money as an unemployed house painter. In 1978, after a girlfriend dumped him, he unsuccessfully attempted to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head and chest with .22 caliber handgun. While working as an insurance claim adjuster, he began a relationship with a woman from Rockville, but she too would dump him in early 1982. After this, Allan began spying on her. On March 21, 1982, he stalked the woman and a man she was dating, using shortcuts to arrive at her house. He snuck in, and when he heard the couple arrive, grabbed two butcher knives and hid under the bed. The woman came into the room and found him, at which point Newman lunged at her and attempted to choke her. Her date then entered the room, and was immediately backstabbed twice. The two managed to temporarily hold off Newman and call the police, but the assailant fled through a bedroom window, cutting off the telephone cord with the knives and re-entering by smashing through the kitchen door. Again, the woman's date was stabbed in the face and chest, but miraculously survived the ordeal. Newman was later arrested and charged with 13 crimes, including attempted murder. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, with his lawyer, Thomas Heeney, claiming that his client was suffering from delusions and paranoia. As part of a plea bargain, Allan plead guilty to two charges of battery and was given mandatory psychiatric counseling and give years probation, as well as a restraining order. He later wrote an apology letter to the woman, claiming that he was sorry and wanted to change for the better. In early 1985, he requested an early termination of his probation, which was denied. After living in Falls Church, Virginia for several years, Newman moved to an apartment building near the Wheaton Metro Station. He was described as a regular-looking and quiet tenant, but was often behind on rent. Crime spree Newman's first recorded crime occurred on February 20, 1991, when he stole a 1987 Nissan Sentra in Rockville, shooting the owner in the arm. The following day, a bank in Fairfax, Virginia was robbed by a man using the same car. Months later, on November 13, he attempted to burgle into an automobile dealership in Silver Spring, but was intercepted by two maintenance workers: 30-year-old Jose Escobar and 39-year-old Maura Portillo. In retaliation, Newman shot and killed both of them using his .357 Magnum, and fled the scene. Twelve days later, Allan carjacked a red Toyota Supra in Rockville, which he used to rob a Signet Jewelers bank in Ellicott City the next day. On January 15, 1992, he shot and killed 31-year-old Jose Ramos during a robbery at a parking lot outside his Rockville apartment. On February 24, while searching for another car, Newman came across 45-year-old Dr. Shahin Hashtroudi, an Iranian-born professor at the George Washington University, who was just leaving her Bethesda office. He shot her once in the head, leaving her to die from her injuries before stealing her white 1987 Toyota Camry. Hashtroudi's car was later used for robbing the Central Fidelity Bank in Chantilly, Virginia on March 5, with Newman ditching the vehicle five days later.Location reported as either Fairfax or Merrifield On April 9, Newman carjacked a man in Falls Church, and the day after, used it as an escape vehicle after robbing the Citizens Bank of Maryland in Bethesda. His last recorded crime occurred in October: donning either a ski mask or undergarments to cover his face, he threatened two teenage girls with a handgun in Woodlawn, telling them to hand over their car, a black 1983 Honda Civic belonging to one of the girls' mothers. At that moment, an off-duty officer encountered him, and the two men exchanged gunshots before Newman fled with the car. Capture, imprisonment and death Following the carjacking, a police chase was initiated which spanned three states and ended in two shootouts between Newman and law enforcement. Eventually, he crashed the car into a curb in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, resulting in another standoff. After 45 minutes, during which Newman expressed suicidal tendencies and threatened to shoot himself in the head, he was eventually persuaded to surrender. Following his arrest, police departments from Maryland, Virginia and the FBI began investigating Newman's activities, aiming to connect him recent bank robberies and carjackings in the region. His apartment in Wheaton was searched, with police seizing his 1980s blue Chevy Chevette, stacks of newspapers dating back to 1989, clothing, shopping bags, painting equipment and other items. In the meantime, the ATF tested shell casings from the Magnum that Newman was carrying, revealing that it was the same weapon used in the Hashtroudi killing. Two days after this revelation, Newman was also connected to the Escobar–Portillo and Ramos killings. He was also suspected in the murders of 34-year-old businessman J. Schuyler Alland in Baltimore and 29-year-old Reynaldo Patdu, who was shot dead in the same apartment complex where Newman lived. It was later determined that the cases were unrelated, with Alland's actual murderers being captured a year later. Newman was convicted of the four murders and several weapons offences, receiving four terms of life imprisonment. He was sent off to serve his sentence at the Jessup Correctional Institution, where several years later he would be found unconscious in his shared cell. Medical personnel were unable to resuscitate him, and Newman was declared deceased. His death was investigated and his cellmate questioned, but no conclusive cause of death could be determined.

After studying painting in Frankfurt, he worked at the Oper Frankfurt, assisting Caspar Neher. Together they moved to Brecht's Berliner Ensemble where Hill created an iconic stage for Mutter Courage and took hundreds of scene photographs now archived at the Akademie der Künste. When the Berlin Wall was erected, Hill, who lived in the West and had worked in the East, began to work freelance, including at the Royal Opera House. In 1966 he became director of scenery (Ausstattunggsleiter) at Opernhaus Dortmund, and there he created the stage for the world premiere of Eli by Walter Steffens, which was followed by 45 other productions. Hill is best remembered for his focus on light projection.  Life and work = 1913–1945  Born in Eberstadt (now part of Darmstadt), he was called Hainer at an early age. His mother was a tailor and his father a decoration painter. Beginning in 1927, following elementary school, Hill was trained as a house painter. Simultaneously, he took a course in decoration painting at the Städtischen Gewerbeschule in Darmstadt. Starting in 1931, he continued his education at the Staatsschule für Kunst und Handwerk, studying painting under Richard Throll. He received his diploma in May 1935. While at university, he created many watercolours, drawings, and oil paintings. He then worked as an assistant to Ludwig Sievert, the chief scenic designer at the Städtische Bühnen Frankfurt. In December 1935, with a scholarship, he was a 'master student' (') of Franz Karl Delavilla at Städel'sche Kunstschule. Hill's focus became the use of lighting, and its influence on the space on stage and its relation to the dynamic of music. At the Oper Frankfurt, he met the designer Caspar Neher, and made projections realising Neher's ideas, for projects in Frankfurt, later also in Berlin, Darmstadt, Hamburg, Glyndebourne, Berlin and Vienna, for 34 productions between 1936 and 1951.  1945–1961  After World War II, Hill worked as scenic designer at the Städtische Bühnen Gera and then at the , where he met Bertolt Brecht in 1950. He followed him to Berlin, working until 1953 as scenic designer and assistant director, with Brecht, Therese Giehse, Benno Besson and Egon Monk. He introduced the technique of projections, which impressed the critic and the playwright Heiner Müller. He also turned to theatre photography, producing hundreds of photographs of scenes from such Berliner Ensemble plays as Mutter Courage, Urfaust, Dom Juan, Die Gewehre der Frau Carrar and Der Kaukasische Kreidekreis. He worked as a guest at the Schillertheater, the Komische Oper Berlin, the Hamburg State Opera and again in Frankfurt. From 1953, he was chief scenic, light and costumes designer (Ausstattungsleiter) at the Staatsoper Berlin, which then played at the Admiralspalast. He moved to West-Berlin in 1954, which made later international work possible. When the opera house Unter den Linden was reopened, he designed the stage for Alban Berg's Wozzeck, played on 14 December 1955, conducted by Johannes Schüler and staged by Werner Kelch, which became an unexpected success. He created designs for Elektra by Richard Strauss, Gluck's Orpheus und Eurydike, Borodin's Fürst Igor, Egk's Der Revisor, Jean Kurt Forest's Tai Yang erwacht and Mussorgski's Chowanschtschina. In 1959, Hill held a Master class for projection painting at the Bayreuth Festival. He designed the set for the first scenic presentation of Bach's St Matthew Passion in Europe at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, conducted by Hermann Scherchen  1961–2001  The building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 caused a break in his career. As all positions in West Berlin were taken, he began to work freelance in the world, carrying a mobile workshop. In 1961 he designed for Wagner Der Ring des Nibelungen at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, well received by the press. In 1962 he was a guest at the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe, and received a contract the following year. He created, beginning with Tchaikovsky's Pique Dame, scenes for 27 plays and operas. In 1963, he designed stage and costumes for Wagner's Lohengrin at the Royal Opera House in London, conducted by Otto Klemperer, with Sandor Konya in the title role and Régine Crespin as Elsa. In 1966 when the new Opernhaus Dortmund opened, he designed the stage for Hindemith's Mathis der Maler, conducted by Hans Swarowsky. He remained at the house from 1967 to 1976 as Ausstattungsleiter and Erster Bühnenbildner, working with conductors Wilhelm Schüchter, Werner Egk, Hans Wallat and Marek Janowski, and directors Hans Hartleb, , and Karl Paryla. Among his 45 projects there, he designed the stage for the world premiere of Eli by Walter Steffens. His last major project was a collaboration with Harry Buckwitz in 1977 at the Schauspielhaus Zürich Schweyk im Zweiten Weltkrieg, with Helmut Lohner and Christiane Hörbiger in the leading roles. He then turned to designs and drawings. Hill died on 20 August 2001 in Karlsruhe. His gravestone shows his motto: \\"Die Seele des Bühnenraums ist das Licht. Es gibt der Phantasie des Betrachters die notwendige Orientierung\\" (\\"The lighting is the soul of the stage. From it, the imagination of the audience gets the orientation it needs\\".) His estate is held at three locations, by Deutsches Theatermuseum, in the , and in the , especially his photographs of Brecht's performances with the Berliner Ensemble.

Career Zhebrak received his undergraduate degree from Timiryazev Agricultural Academy in 1925, then pursued a four year program in graduate studies at the Institute of Red Professors, graduating in 1929. The Institute of Red Professors was created by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to address a shortage of Marxist professors, Zhebrak was one of just 236 graduates during the period 1924 to 1929. Zhebrak received a Rockefeller Fellowship, pursuing post-graduate studies at Columbia University in 1930–31. From 1935 to 1948, Zhebrak was head of the genetics department at Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. Over the 1948–49 academic year, Zhebrak was a professor of botany at the Moscow Institute of Timber Industry. In 1949 he moved to the Academy of Medical Science's Institute of Pharmacology in Moscow, where he was a professor of botany until his death, in 1965. Zhebrak had joined the Communist Party in 1928, during his graduate studies. As his scientific achievements continued through his career, this party membership reduced possible roadblocks within the Soviet academic community; by example, he had witnessed that 62 of the 69 professors at the Institute of Red Professors, during the last year of his graduate studies, were members of the Communist Party. In 1940, Zhebrak was granted membership in the Academy of Sciences of the Byelorussian SSR (serving as its president in 1947), and he served as an official of the Science Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1945–46. In 1996, Nikolai Krementsov published the book Stalinist Science, in which he cites Zhebrak, and others, as forces who found ways to bypass and even exploit the Party's political systems, creating more academic freedom than would otherwise have been allowed. This was not without its dangers, as he was one of numerous scientists targeted by an anti-cosmopolitan campaign in the immediate period after World War II.

The success and international acclaim of their first titlePauline Tam, The Ottawa Citizen, December 27, 1995, \\"No longer strangers\\"., Midnight Stranger in 1994, led to a production partnership and publishing arrangement with Corel Corporation, an expanded production budget, and the creation of an associated web site version called \\"Club Mode\\". Mode was intended to be the launch vehicle for an expansion of Corel's CD Home Collection into the multimedia entertainment business; however, after a scathing review in PC Gamer magazineT. Liam McDonald, PC Gamer, January 1997, \\"Reviews: Mode\\"., Corel never fully released Mode, the division responsible for the CD Home Collection was shut downFrank, Issue 237, January 15, 1997, \\"Blood flows over Corel video game bomb\\", and its software assets were sold to Hoffmann + Associates of Toronto. Mode did receive many favourable reviews at the time, and has since developed an international fan base, see Reception below. Edited playthroughs by one player posted on YouTube between 2012 and 2014 have collectively received over 100,000 views. Experienced from the player's Point Of View (POV), users find themselves at the start of the game crashing an exclusive high-society fashion and art party on the top floor of an unnamed hotel hosted by anarchist artist Vito Brevis. The primary mystery at the heart of the event is Vito’s true intentions. He appears cynical and anarchistic, but hidden information can be found that implies that he is actually part of a secret cabal that is using this event as some kind of supernatural ritual. The gameplay progresses through emotion- based interactions with other characters that are also attending the party, with the goal of creating in the player a feeling of shared intimacy with those characters. Gameplay Like Midnight Stranger, Mode is video-based and also uses an emotional continuum Mood Bar for interaction with the in-story characters rather than a text interface or an itemized set of options for each interaction. In Midnight Stranger, the Mood Bar had been proven to simulate some of the frustration and uncertainty of dealing with other people in social situations,Rahlmann, Reed. Newmedia Magazine, September, 1994. and provide a more realistic role playing experienceLowell, Jeremy. Shift, Winter 1995., and so was used similarly in Mode. The red, left end of the bar represents a negative response (\\"no\\", \\"I disagree\\", \\"I don’t like that\\"), the blue central part of the band represents a neutral response (\\"I don’t know\\", \\"I don’t care\\", \\"I have no opinion\\"), and the green right end of the bar represents a positive response (\\"yes\\", \\"I agree\\", \\"I like that\\").Jim Gasperini, Wired, December 1994, \\"Virtual Loneliness\\". While the bar is a smooth colour gradient that shows no clear demarcations, giving the illusion of infinite choice, practically there were usually only a few possible pathways from any given bar, with varying percentages of the bar devoted to the choices depending on circumstance. Mode had more material than Midnight Stranger, and was distributed on 3 CD-ROMs; however, it continued to use the technique of embedding small frames of video into full screen still frames to save disk space -- usually the head and shoulders of the speaking character being the only part of the frame that moved. This embedded video technique allowed many times more interactive material to be included on the disks than could have been done with full-screen video (even if highly compressed), and thus allowed greater freedom in storytelling and a more diverse cast within the technical limitations of the CD-ROM format. This approach was both laudedDavid Wade, CD- ROM Today, October 1994. and criticized in published reviews, since it is a clever solutionEden Maxwell, Computer Gaming World, October 1994, \\"Relationships That Pass In The Night\\". yet often created distracting disjoints between character motion and the framing image.Matt Foley, Axcess Magazine, Vol. II, No. 5.

Background=Hari Singh Hari Singh Jaaj was born in Chandigarh and graduated with a degree in mathematics from St. Xavier's College, Mumbai. He then studied audio engineering in Chennai, and later specialised in electronic music production in Manchester, UK. He performs as a backing vocalist and is the producer and audio engineer. Sukhmani Malik Sukhmani Malik was born in New Delhi and grew up in Chandigarh, listening to folk songs and Sufi music. She got a bachelor's degree in psychology and music and then pursued a master's in Hindustani classical vocal music in Chandigarh. Between 2003 and 2007, she trained with a classical vocalist in Rampur gharana Band Singh and Malik met in November 2008, and discovered a shared interest in folk music. They formed a band in 2009, producing 10 songs and getting their first gig in \\"a couple of weeks\\". Both Singh and Malik sing, while the former also works as a producer and operates the console during live performances. Their songs fuse Punjabi folk music and electronic music, and draw from the poetry of Sufi saints such as Bulle Shah, Baba Farid, Kabir, and Shah Hussain. The compositions have been noted for making the Sufi poets' work accessible to today's audiences. In a 2013 interview in The Hindu, Malik explained their choice of genre, \\"The idea was to do old folk songs, because the new generation doesn’t hear them. And Hari wanted to go into a chill-out zone with it.\\" The duo perform in Punjabi, Hindi or English. Their style is minimal in contrast to the usual modern renditions, and Singh explained in an interview: \\"Bhangra is a very new thing. Traditional folk has never been hardcore; it is very easy going, you never hear big dhols. The idea was to keep that vibe.\\" Hari and Sukhmani produced the folk song Kangi Bawan for director Deepa Mehta's 2008 film Heaven on Earth. In 2016, they collaborated with the Pakistani rock band Noori for the song Yaariyan. In 2019, they collaborated with the Australian band The Coconut Kids on the song Baagey, a bilingual reinterpretation of Baage Vich Aaya Karo, a traditional Punjabi love song. Collaboration with folk artists The duo have collaborated with folk musicians from India and abroad, including morchang player Chugge Khan, Indian percussionist and composer Trilok Gurtu, Vietnamese classical guitarist Thu Le, Iranian percussionist Fakhroddin Ghaffari, singer Suman Sridhar, and Arshad Khan, who plays esraj, a stringed instrument from the Bengal region.

On the same day Trump had signed into law Hong Kong Autonomy Act, one of the laws from which the order derives authority. The act and the executive order are the US's response to the imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China on June 30, 2020, which was described as \\"an unusual and extraordinary threat [...] to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States\\" in the preamble. Trump said the executive order was to \\"hold China accountable for its aggressive actions against the people of Hong Kong\\", and Hong Kong would be treated the same as China. The order directs government agencies to eliminate preferential treatments given to Hong Kong as compared to Mainland China. Background The Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (HKPA), last amended by the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, is the groundwork for the US policies that maintain relations with Hong Kong as separate from Mainland China, to the extent consistent with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, after the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong.While existing US laws and certain international agreements continue to apply to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after July 1997, section 202 of the act allows the US president to issue an executive order to suspend such treatments if he determines that Hong Kong is \\"is not sufficiently autonomous to justify treatment\\" different from that accorded China under US laws. In May 2020, after the Chinese National People's Congress decision on Hong Kong national security legislation was adopted, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported to the US Congress that Hong Kong was no longer autonomous. Following the enactment of the Hong Kong national security law by Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in June 2020, the US Congress promptly and unanimously passed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act.  Provisions  The measures introduced in the executive order include: * Export control **All of Hong Kong's license under the Export Administration Regulations that are not available to China are to be revoked **The export of \\"U.S.-origin defense equipment\\" to Hong Kong is to be ended under the Arms Export Control Act * Sanctions The Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary of State can impose sanctions on foreign persons who are : **engaged in developing, adopting, or implementing the Hong Kong national security law **engaged in undermining the democracy, threatening the autonomy, imposing censorship or committing serious human rights abuse in Hong Kong **leaders or officials of a government or private entities engaged in the above activities * Law Enforcement Notice of intent is given to: ** suspend the Agreement for the Surrender of Fugitive Offenders ** terminate the Agreement for the Transfer of Sentenced Persons ** end the provision of training to the Hong Kong Police at the International Law Enforcement Academies * Travel and Immigration Hong Kong is no longer treated as separate from China: ** for the purpose of numerical limitations on immigration under the Immigration Act of 1990 ** with respect to the duration of nonimmigrant visas under Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 ** for the Diversity Immigrant Visa program (commonly known as the green card lottery) ** for the eligibility of its residents to Visa waiver programs of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands (both holders of HKSAR Passport and British National (Overseas) passport are affected) *Other provisions **Hong Kong is to be treated as the same as China by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States in its annual reporting **A notice of intent is to be given to terminate a 1989 bilateral agreement granting reciprocal exemption of income tax **The Fulbright exchange program with Hong Kong and China is to be terminated **The cooperation between the U.S. Geological Survey and the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Institute of Space and Earth Information Science is discontinued  Implementations = Sanctions  On August 7, 2020, pursuant to the order, the US Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on 11 individuals for \\"undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and restricting the freedom of expression or assembly\\", including: *Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong, member of the Executive Council, member of the Committee for Safeguarding National Security (CSNS), who pushed the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill *Chris Tang, Commissioner of Hong Kong Police Force, member of the CSNS, under whose leadership the police besieged the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in November 2019 *Stephen Lo, Former Commissioner of Hong Kong Police Force, under whose leadership 4000 protesters were arrested and 1600 were injured *John Lee, Secretary for Security of Hong Kong, member of the Executive Council, member of the CSNS, who introduced a new police unit dedicated to enforcing the Hong Kong National Security Law *Teresa Cheng, Secretary for Justice of Hong Kong, member of the Executive Council, member of the CSNS *Erick Tsang, Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs of Hong Kong, member of the Executive Council *Xia Baolong, Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of China *Zhang Xiaoming, Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of China *Luo Huining, Director of the Hong Kong Liaison Office of the Chinese government *Zheng Yanxiong, director, Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong *Eric Chan, Secretary General of the CSNS Also subject to sanctions on the same day, corresponding with an action by the United Nations Security Council, is Bi Sidi Souleymane from the Central African Republic. The militia group Return, Reclamation, Rehabilitation (3R), is responsible for the killing, torture, rape, or displacement of thousands since 2015 under his leadership.https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1087 As a result of their inclusion in the Specially Designated Nationals List, all of their property and interests in property in the US are blocked and must be reported to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. All US persons are prohibited from transactions (including the contribution or provision of funds, goods or services) involving the property or interest of the eleven sanctioned persons.  Country of origin marking of products  The executive order suspended the application of section 201(a) of HKPA to section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S. Code § 1304), which stipulates that every article of foreign origin shall be marked the English name of the country of origin. On August 11, 2020, US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) announced that the imported goods produced in Hong Kong could no longer indicate themselves as \\"Made in Hong Kong\\" after September 25, but must indicate \\"China\\" as the country of origin instead. This reversed the practice announced by the then-US Customs Service in June 1997, which determined that that goods from Hong Kong should continue to indicate their origin as \\"Hong Kong\\" after July 1, 1997. This change does not affect the reporting for purposes of assessing duties under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.  Suspension or termination of three bilateral agreements  On August 18, 2020, the Consulate General of the United States in Hong Kong notified the government of Hong Kong that the United States had suspended or terminated three bilateral agreements: for the surrender of fugitive offenders, for the transfer of sentenced persons and for reciprocal tax exemptions on income derived from the international operation of ships. The US Department of State referred to this as part of the implementation measures set forth in the executive order.  Responses =Signing of the executive order China's ministry of foreign affairs criticized the US for interfering in \\"purely China’s internal affairs\\", namely the implementation of a law that safeguards the country's national security. The spokesperson urged to US to \\"correct its mistakes\\", otherwise China will give \\"firm response\\" and impose sanctions on relevant US persons. The HKSAR government, in addition to reiterating the necessity of the national security law, said the SAR's special status as a separate customs territory, under the \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" principle, is conferred by the PRC Constitution and the Hong Kong Basic Law. It warned the US that unliteral measures that limit normal business activities would affect its own interests, and stressed that the measures imposed under Hong Kong Autonomy Act and the executive order \\"do not have any legal effect\\" on Hong Kong's financial institutions. It might also consider taking actions against the US under the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Countersanctions On August 11, 2020, China imposed sanctions without specification on eleven US individuals, namely Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton and Pat Toomey, Representative Chris Smith, Carl Gershman (president of the National Endowment for Democracy), Derek Mitchell (president of the National Democratic Institute), Daniel Twining (president of the International Republican Institute), Kenneth Roth (executive director of the Human Rights Watch) and Michael Abramowitz (president of Freedom House). The spokesman of the foreign ministry said the sanctioned \\"behaved badly\\" on Hong Kong-related issues. Rubio, Cruz and Smith had been put on a travel ban by China. Criticism by Hong Kong Commerce Secretary Hong Kong's commerce secretary Edward Yau condemned USCBP's measures, saying labelling a product from Hong Kong as \\"made in some other place\\" was \\"calling white black\\". He added that this practice did not comply with WTO rules, as it undermined Hong Kong's status as a separate customs territory. Bilateral agreements Hong Kong government severely reprimanded the US on August 20, denouncing such acts as having \\"[politicized] juridical co-operation\\" which damaged the basis of juridical cooperation between the governments. As a result, Hong Kong government announced that it had, at the central government's instruction, notified the US Consulate General of the suspension of the agreements of surrender of fugitive offenders and of mutual legal assistance on criminal matters. It said it would continue to upload the principle of mutual assistance and reciprocity.

History The Khen dynasty replaced the weak rulers of the Kamata kingdom in the middle of the 15th century.There were only three Khen rulers. The last king, Nilambar expanded the kingdom to include the present Koch Bihar district of West Bengal, the undivided Kamrup and Darrang districts of Assam, northern Mymensingh, now in Bangladesh, and eastern parts of Dinajpur district.Baruah, S L (1986), A Comprehensive History of Assam, New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd., page 44}}In 1498, its last capital at Gosanimari was attacked by the invading army of Alauddin Husain Shah of Bengal. That was the end of the Khen dynasty. Geography=Location Rajpat is located at The Kamtapur Fort was spread from the Dharla River in the east to Godaikhora in the west, and from Sitalabas in the north to Silduar-Soawariganj in the south. The palace was in the centre of the fort and is now referred to as Rajpat.Koch Bihar Jelar Purakirti (in Bengali), Data compilation and writing by Dr. Shyamachand Mukhopadhayay, published by the Department of Archaeology, Government of West Bengal, Second edition 1974, Page 28. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivisions. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. The fort The fort was surrounded by a horse-shoe type high earthen wall running for around and was open only on the side where the Dharla River was there. Now, it is mostly around 30 feet high and 35 feet wide. It was higher and wider in earlier days. The fort had seven entrance doors. There was a 250 feet wide float all around it. There was a system of providing regular water for it. Various people visiting the fort in the earlier days had seen many roads, temples, ponds and other utilities. In 1808, Dr. Buchanan Hamilton, visited the place and saw many broken structures. He also saw two brick-built walls inside the earthen enclosures. He left behind a detailed report. Now, all one can see is a large mound strewn with broken pieces of structures. Many statues or interesting items found in the fort have been kept aside for visitors to see. Archaeological Survey of India According to the List of Monuments of National Importance in West Bengal Rajpat is a monument of national importance. Excavations were carried out in 1998-2000, by the Archaeological Survey of India at the Rajpat Mound. Only a few antiquities and some pottery have been found. The pottery bears similarity with pottery made/ used in Assam, some of the antiquities indicate their belonging to the Pala- Sena period of the 11-12th century. The excavations do point to the place having come up before the Khen dynasty captured it.

Since Bâciyân-ı Rûm was an organization made up of women and that no such group was mentioned in any other source than Aşıkpaşazade's work, it attracted the attention of many researchers. It was claimed that it might be a mistake of copying to take the form of the word \\"bâciyân\\" (sisters). Franz Taeschner argued that the original of this might be \\"hajiyân-ı Rûm\\" (pilgrims of Rome) or \\"bahşiyân-ı Rûm\\" (clerks of Rome). Zeki Velidi Togan also supported this view. On the other hand, Mehmet Fuat Köprülü, taking into account that Haji Bektash Veli's relationship with them was explained, and since female members of his sect were usually given the nickname \\"bacı\\", sees the existence of this organization possible. A record that confirms Köprülü's view, was Bertrandon de la Broquière's travelogue. La Broquière mentioned that the Beylik of Dulkadir had a Turkmen militia consisting of women.

Set primarily in 1927 Paris, the book is largely inspired by events in the life of artist Tamara de Lempicka.  Plot  Set primarily in 1920s Paris, The Last Nude is told through two perspectives: a young Italian-American named Rafaela Fano, and the Art Deco painter Tamara de Lempicka. Rafaela, a 17-year-old runaway, by chance meets the wealthy aspiring painter de Lempicka and agrees to model for her. Rafaela becomes both de Lempicka's muse and lover, inspiring the painter's most esteemed work La Bella Rafaela. As Rafaela's attraction and relations to Tamara grow, she learns the high price of ambition and reality. All but the last 60 pages of the novel are told from Rafaela's point of view, and work as a fictionalised biography of de Lempicka. The last chapters, told from de Lempicka's perspective, are set in Mexico in 1980. The artist once again takes up her brush and works on her last painting, a copy of the portrait of her long-ago muse. Avery described why she changed character viewpoints in the latter part of the novel: > \\"I wrote the entire novel from Rafaela's point of view, and then I was > completely taken by surprise by this voice in my head that was louder, > stranger, more demanding, more ruthless than Rafaela's voice — it was > Tamara's voice. And I had to try writing in it, and it just came out like a > roar. Like an aria. And I was excited and scared, and I just let her speak, > and ... having done so, realized that something Rafaela took 120 pages to > say, Tamara could say in two lines. And that meant that I wound up cutting > the book by a full quarter.\\"  Reception  Avery's second novel, The Last Nude was generally well- received by critics, who commented on her evocation of 1927 Paris: \\"a fun and transporting travelogue. The author's effusive enthusiasm for era and place is palpable.\\" \\"The conversations between Tamara and Rafaela crackle with erotic charge, while the prose, at once elegant and precise, brings scenes to life with vivid force.\\" Several reviewers commented on the obvious passion Avery had for her subject, and The Last Nude was compared to the historical novels of Sarah Waters, and praised as \\"the kind of offbeat, risky book that’s threatened with extinction by an increasingly risk-averse publishing industry.\\" There was disagreement over the effectiveness of the second portion of the book, in which an ageing de Lempicka paints her last portrait of Rafaela: \\"The Last Nude's closing segment goes about elucidating some of the motivations behind the character's behavior, but the cluttered denouement feels imbalanced,\\" although the contrast between \\"the energetic frenzy of the 1920s and the retrospective and cynical elderly Lempicka provides a successful counterbalance of narrative.\\" Awards and nominations *Finalist for the Lesbian Fiction prize at the Lambda Literary Awards *Winner of the American Library Association Stonewall Book Awards Barbara Gittings Literature Award  References  Category:2012 American novels Category:Novels with lesbian themes Category:Novels with bisexual themes Category:Stonewall Book Award- winning works Category:American LGBT novels Category:Lambda Literary Award- winning works Category:Novels set in Paris Category:2010s LGBT novels Category:American historical novels ","title":"The Last Nude"},{"id":"64784282","text":"Ashok Sarma is an Indian politician from Assam belonging to Bharatiya Janata Party.

The song was released on 7 August 2020. It is the band's first single in 17 years, and is part of The Makarrata Project, a themed mini-album of collaborations with Indigenous artists. Midnight Oil has pledged to donate its share of any proceeds it receives from the song to organisations promoting the 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart, which called for the creation of a \\"First Nations Voice\\" enshrined in the Australian Constitution. Background The track takes its title from Sydney's traditional owners, the Gadigal people (also spelled \\"Cadigal\\"), whose land extends from the Sydney CBD to South Head and through to the Inner West. A statement from Sony Music Australia explained: \\"It is a provocative recount of what happened in this place, and elsewhere in Australia, since 1788\\". The track lyrics use a play on the traditional Welcome to Country. In a statement, the band said regarding the song: > \\"We've always been happy to lend our voice to those who call for racial > justice, but it really feels like we've reached a tipping point. We urge the > federal government to heed the messages in the Uluru Statement From The > Heart and act accordingly. Hopefully this song and The Makarrata Project > mini-album we've created alongside our First Nations friends can help shine > a bit more light on the urgent need for genuine reconciliation in this > country and in many other places too\\". The song includes a verse written and spoken by Gadigal poet Joel Davison, who told NITV the experience was \\"validating\\" as a poet and language revivalist. Davison said: \\"It was kind of wild being contacted by their manager, and at first I thought it was a scam or something. I didn't know what to think. He expressed gratitude for his inclusion in the song, stating: \\"I'm glad that I was able to be there to make sure that the language of my Gadigal ancestors was heard on this track\\". Live performances Midnight Oil played the song at the 17th Annual National Indigenous Music Awards on 8 August 2020. Critical reception Tom Breihan from Stereogum described the song as \\"a big, bouncy rocker that sounds a whole lot like an arena jam\\", adding, \\"like so many Midnight Oil songs before it, the track is all about how Australia belongs to its Aboriginal people and about how white colonizers should get the fuck out\\".

History Before the Marshall Islands become an independent state (1986), the Marshallese decided to have their own constitutional law in 1966. In 1976, was organised a Constitutional Convention of 46 elected members. This Convention drafted the Constitution of 1979, having into consideration a future independence status. Structure The Constitution of the Marshall Islands mixes British and American constitutional concepts based mainly on Westminster system, with a legislative branch that originates the executive branch, with an independent judicial branch. The legislature is a bicameral institution, consisting of the Council of Irooij (Traditional High Chiefs) and the elected Nitijeļā (Parliament). The Nitijeļā is the law-making branch of the legislature and consists of 33 elected members, every four years. The Nitijeļā also elects from its members the President of the Marshall Islands and, on nomination by the President, other members of the parliament to serve as the Cabinet of the Marshall Islands. The Cabinet is the executive branch and directs the actions of the Government. The Cabinet is then responsible to the Nitijeļā for its executive actions.

R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth fantasy writings have often been accused of embodying outmoded attitudes to race, but he was strongly anti-racist both in peacetime and during the two World Wars, and Middle-earth is both multi- cultural and multi-lingual, in peace or war.  Alleged racism  Some critics have found what they consider outmoded views on race in Tolkien's Middle-earth stories, generally based on their views of how his imagery depicts the relationship between evil and race (the main races being Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit, Southron, Man, Orc).  Fear of moral decline through racial mixing  The scholars of English literature William N. Rogers II and Michael R. Underwood note that a widespread element of late 19th century Western culture was fear of moral decline and degeneration; this led to eugenics. In The Two Towers, the Ent Treebeard says:. The Two Towers, Lord of the Rings book 3, ch. 4, \\"Treebeard\\" The film-maker Andrew Stewart, writing in CounterPunch, cites this speech as an instance of \\"mid-twentieth century scientific racism .. which alarmingly spells out the notion of 'race mixing' as a great sin\\".  Orcs as demonized enemy  In a private letter, Tolkien describes orcs as: alt=Poster showing fanged caricature of \\"Tokio kid,\\" a Japanese person pointing a bloody knife at a sign that reads \\"Much waste of material make so-o-o-o happy! Thank you!\\" A variety of critics and commentators have noted that orcs are somewhat like caricatures of non-Europeans. The journalist David Ibata writes that the orcs in Peter Jackson's Tolkien films look much like \\"the worst depictions of the Japanese drawn by American and British illustrators during World War II.\\" The scholar of English literature Robert Tally calls the orcs a demonized enemy, despite (he writes) Tolkien's own objections to demonization of the enemy in the two World Wars. Andrew O'Hehir describes orcs as \\"a subhuman race bred by Morgoth and/or Sauron (although not created by them) that is morally irredeemable and deserves only death. They are dark-skinned and slant-eyed, and although they possess reason, speech, social organization and, as Shippey mentions, a sort of moral sensibility, they are inherently evil.\\" He notes Tolkien's own description of them, saying it could scarcely be more revealing as a representation of the \\"Other\\", but that it is \\"the product of his background and era, like most of our inescapable prejudices. At the level of conscious intention, he was not a racist or an anti-Semite\\", and mentions his letters to this effect. In a letter to his son, Christopher, who was serving in the RAF in the Second World War, Tolkien wrote of orcs as appearing on both sides of the conflict: The literary critic Jenny Turner, writing in the London Review of Books, endorses O'Hehir's comment that orcs are \\"by design and intention a northern European's paranoid caricature of the races he has dimly heard about\\".  Moral geography: West versus East  alt=Tolkien's moral geography of Middle-earth, good in the west, evil in the east, simple in the north, sophisticated in the south. The Shire is in the northwest (simple/good) quadrant, Gondor in the southwest, and Mordor in the southeast. Stewart states that the geography of Middle-earth deliberately pits the good West against the evil East; John Magoun, writing in the J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia, concurs, stating that Middle-earth has a \\"fully expressed moral geography\\". The peoples of Middle-earth vary from the hobbits of The Shire in the Northwest, evil \\"Easterlings\\" in the East, and \\"imperial sophistication and decadence\\" in the South. Magoun explains that Gondor is both virtuous, being West, and has problems, being South; Mordor in the Southeast is hellish, while Harad in the extreme South \\"regresses into hot savagery\\". Any North-South bias was denied by Tolkien in a 1967 letter to his interviewers Charlotte and Denis Plimmer:  Anti-racism = Opposition to peacetime Nazi racial theory  In 1938, the publishers of the German translation of The Hobbit, of Potsdam, wrote to Tolkien asking if he was of arisch (\\"Aryan\\") descent. He asked his English publisher, Stanley Unwin, if he should He drafted two letters to Rütten & Loening; only one survives, and his biographer Humphrey Carpenter presumes that Unwin sent the other to Rütten & Loening. The surviving draft says  Opposition to wartime anti-German propaganda  The Indigenous studies scholar Lisa Tatonetti writes that even though \\"his textual imagery often aligns with racialized ideologies\\", Tolkien was sharply anti-racist in the Second World War. Tolkien reacted with anger to the excesses of anti-German propaganda during World War II. In a 1944 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:  Opposition to racism in South Africa  During the Second World War, Tolkien's son Christopher, training in South Africa, expressed concern about the treatment of Africans at the hands of whites, and his father replied:  Polycultural Middle-earth  The Germanic studies scholar Sandra Ballif Straubhaar states that \\"a polycultured, polylingual world is absolutely central\\" to Middle-earth, and that readers and filmgoers will easily see that. The historian and Tolkien scholar Jared Lobdell likewise disagreed with any notions of racism inherent or latent in Tolkien's works, and wondered \\"if there were a way of writing epic fantasy about a battle against an evil spirit and his monstrous servants without its being subject to speculation of racist intent\\". Straubhaar calls the \\"recurring accusations in the popular media\\" of racism in Tolkien's construction of Middle-earth \\"interesting\\". Straubhaar quotes the Swedish cultural studies scholar David Tjeder who described Gollum's account of the men of Harad (\\"Not nice; very cruel wicked Men they look. Almost as bad as Orcs, and much bigger.\\". The Two Towers, book 4, ch. 3 \\"The Black Gate is Closed\\") in Aftonbladet as \\"stereotypical and reflective of colonial attitudes\\". She argues instead that Gollum's view, with its \\"arbitrary and stereotypical assumptions about the 'Other'\\", is absurd, and that Gollum cannot be taken as an authority on Tolkien's opinion. Straubhaar contrasts this with Sam Gamgee's more humane response to the sight of a dead Harad warrior, which she finds \\"harder to find fault with\\": Straubhaar quotes the English scholar Stephen Shapiro, who wrote in The Scotsman that Straubhaar concedes that Shapiro may have had a point with \\"slant-eyed\\", but comments that this was milder than that of many of his contemporary novelists such as John Buchan, and notes that Tolkien had in fact made \\"appalled objection\\" when people had misapplied his story to current events. She similarly observes that Tjeder had failed to notice Tolkien's \\"concerted effort\\" to change the Western European \\"paradigm\\" that speakers of supposedly superior languages were \\"ethnically superior\\". Patrick Curry, Christine Chism and others argue that race-focused critiques often omit relevant textual evidence, cite imagery from adaptations rather than the work itself, ignore the absence of evidence of racist attitudes or events in the author's personal life, and claim that the perception of racism is itself a marginal view.

As of 2020, she heads the Sami Research Steering Committee at the Research Council of Norway. For the period 2020 to 2022, she has been appointed project leader for the SANKS (Sami Advisory Unit on Mental Health and Substance Use) project Vold og overgrep i samiske samfunn (Violence and Abuse in Sami Communities). Biography Born on 8 December 1953, Marit Myrvoll was raised with her sister and her little brother in Bodø in Norland County by her Sami mother who came from Sør-Troms. As a child, she became familiar with some of the Sami traditions and expressions which she later studied in depth at university. While at Bodø High School, she wrote an essay about the Norwegianization of the Sami, aware that it was not ideal to be a Sami in the Norwegian town. After high school, while training to be a teacher she learnt a bit more about the Sami. She went on to work as a teacher from 1977 to 1987 apart from a couple of years when she studied Sami culture and ethnic relationships at the University of Tromsø. In 1980, she participated in the establishment of the Bodø Sami Association, later renamed the Sør-Salten Sami Association, a local branch of the Norwegian Sámi Association (NSR), becoming its first president. After becoming a mother in 1981, she reduced her political involvement until she attended a meeting of the National Sami Association in 1983, later being elected to the organization's student union, Sámi Oahppolihttu. In 1987, she was successful in applying for appointment as secretary of the NSR. Together with her six-year-old son she moved to Karasjok where she stayed for the next five years. After the Sami Act was adopted in 1987, she played an active part in preparing for the Sami parliamentary elections in 1989, speaking at information meetings around the country. In 1989, this led to her becoming a member of the Norwegian Sami Council in preparation for the opening of the Sami Parliament. For the next three years, she was an official for the administration of the Sami Parliament. While studying at the University of Tromsø in 1996, Myrvoll wrote a dissertation on the Dalai Lama's approach to democratization while living in exile. It was based on her 1994 field study at the Tibetan refugee settlements in India where she met the Dalai Lama on several occasions. In March 2011, she earned a PhD in social anthropology from the University of Tromsø with a thesis titled \\"Bare gudsordet duger. Om kontinuitet og brudd i samisk virkelighetsforståelse\\" (Only the word of God counts. On continuity and change in the Sami's understanding of reality). As of August 2020, Myrvoll is director of the Várdobáiki Museum at the Várdobáiki Sami Centre in Tjeldsund Municipality in the far north of Norway. She heads the Sami Research Steering Committee at the Research Council of Norway.

She is now a Life Fellow at Girton College. Throughout her time in Cambridge, she lectured on and supervised most of the courses in theoretical physics. Research Williams’ early research was in elementary particle physics, then during her second postdoctoral position she started working in classical general relativity. Eventually she combined these two interests by working in quantum gravity in an attempt to find a unified theory of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Her particular approach, called Regge calculus, is a version of discrete gravity where curved space-times are approximated by collections of flat simplices. This may be thought of as a generalisation of geodesic domes to higher dimensions. Williams’ work on Regge calculus includes the classical evolution of model universes, and numerical simulations of discrete quantum gravity, together with investigations of the relationship between Regge calculus and the continuum theory. She has written around 100 papers on her research. Knowledge transfer Williams has given talks on her research to student societies, sixth formers and younger pupils.

Raniculture In 2016, Brazil was considered the 2nd largest frog breeder in the world, second only to Taiwan. However, it is small-scale, without even precise data about the quantity produced: the last official survey cited 160 tons per year, but some say that this number is three times higher. Because the price of a kilo of frog meat is high, consumption is reduced and reserved for a very few people.Brasil é segundo maior criador de rãs do mundo Frog meat is easy to digest, has high nutritional value, low fat content and low cholesterol, and also is considered a gastronomic delicacy. Some nutritionists consider frog meat to be the best protein available for consumption. Carne de rã seria a \\"melhor proteína\\", segundo \\"nutricionista sarada\\": como ela come?

Bangladesh government awarded him the title of Bir Bikram for his bravery in the independence war.  Birth and education  Martyr Lilu Mia's ancestral home is in Kandi village of Lokmankhar in Chhayasuti union of Kuliyarchar upazila of Kishoreganj district. His father's name is Sona Mia, mother is Sirennesa. He was married. His wife is Lalita Begum and they have two sons and two daughters.  Role and martyrdom in the liberation war  The Bengali EPR troops of Thakurgaon Wing were perplexed. Because, at that time there were more than 120 non-Bengali army in that wing headquarters. Besides, there were some army soldiers there. In the end, the call of patriotism won. On the night of 28 March (then clockwise 29 March), the Bengali EPR troops, including Lilu Mia, revolted. The clash between Bengali and non-Bengali EPRs in the wing lasted till March 30. Most of the non-Bengali EPR and Pakistani army (about 115) were killed in the clashes. Then the EPR freedom fighters jumped into the war taking up positions in different places. One group formed defenses at Bhatgaon (23 miles before Thakurgaon), one at Deviganj, one at Shibganj. Apart from this, they also set up defenses at Khansama, Jaiganj and Jharbati on various roads connecting Thakurgaon and Syedpur. During the war of resistance, the freedom fighters did not have field telephone or wireless communication with each other. As a result, there is difficulty in communication between them. Runner was the only means of communication. Then sometimes the responsibility of this work is given to the fearless and tactful Lilu Mia. He performed this duty with courage along with the war. One day in the third week of April, Lilu Mia was going from one defence to another on a motorcycle while performing this duty. On the way, he was attacked by the Pakistan Army at a place named 10 miles on the Dinajpur-Saidpur road. There were defence of the freedom fighters at 10 miles. But the freedom fighters left the defensive position a few days ago after admitting a lot of casualties due to the heavy attack of the Pakistan army. Meanwhile, the news of the freedom fighters from one defence to another has to reach through that area. Taking advantages of the leaving of freedom fighters in the area of 10 miles, the Pakistani army took place there. Occasionally, Pakistani helicopters fly in the sky in a short period. The responsibility of conveying the news fell on Lilu Mia. He did not give up not being even afraid. He went forward through that area without fear. But he did not succeed. The Pakistani army started firing at him. He was shot and fell to the ground. He gave his life doing his duty. He was martyred. The body of martyr Lilu Miah could not be recovered by his comrades. Later his body was buried there by the local villagers. They did not mark the place for fear of Pakistani army. His comrades did not find his body after independence.  Career  Martyr Lilu Mia was working in the 9th Wing (now Battalion) of Dinajpur EPR Sector in 1971. His rank was Lance Naik. Wing Headquarters is located in Thakurgaon town. He was posthumously awarded the title of Bir Bikram for his outstanding contribution in the war of liberation, especially as a runner. According to the Gazette of 1973, his Heroism Review Number is 114.

The radar was originally designed for use during the initial stages of an amphibious assault or military operation where its lightweight relative to other radar systems was a distinct advantage. Once larger radars such as the SCR-270 or AN/TPS-1 came online the SCR-602 could also be used to fill in gaps in radar coverage. Numerous variations of the SCR-602 were manufactured during the war. It was utilized by the United States, United Kingdom and Australia.  Developing the radar  Development of the SCR-602 began in 1942 at the behest of Colonel Gordon P. Saville of the United States Army Air Corps. With delays to the manufacture and fielding of both the SCR-588 and SCR-527, the Air Corps was quickly seeking another radar for ground-controlled interception. This new radar was an adaptation of the United Kingdom's Chain Home Low radar. The Signal Corps was asked to develop a lightweight assault-type radar that could be both air transportable and hand-carried as well as have a range of over 100 miles on enemy bombardment aircraft. Prior to this request, the Air Force relied on the British lightweight warning (LW) radar, which the Signal Corps studied for ideas. After testing the VT-158 in various existing sets such as the SCR-268, a team led by Captain John Marchetti incorporated the VT-158 in a new system designated as the SCR-602. The original SCR-602, known as SCR-602-T1 for “Type 1”, was almost an exact copy of the British LW radar. With the implementation of the VT-158, Marchetti's team developed the SCR-602-T8 (Type 8), which was based on a modified SCR-268 used in the Canal Zone. In order to prove that the newly developed SCR-602-T8 was air transportable, the Signal Corps flew the first laboratory model in a Douglas B-18 Bolo from Newark Airport to a test site in Orlando, Florida on February 27, 1943. Upon arriving at its destination, the SCR-602-T8 was set up and calibrated for testing. At the end of the tests, the engineers determined that the model had a range in excess of 110 miles and could be mass-produced. The SCR-602-T8, which was designated as the AN/TPS-3, soon became the most successful variant of the SCR-602 model. Consisting of a 10-ft parabolic reflector antenna with a horizontal polarized dipole radiator at its focus and a console with an A-scope and a PPI-scope, the AN/TPS-3 became widely used by Army and Marine forces for early warning at beachheads, isolated areas, and captured air bases. Furthermore, the AN/TPS-3 could be assembled and put on the air by a crew of four men in thirty minutes, making it easy to deploy. Many Japanese kamikaze aircraft attacks were reportedly foiled by this radar. By 1944, 900 sets of the SCR-602-T8 were manufactured by Zenith Radio Corporation, and the accompanying VT-158's were produced by Eitel-McCullough, Inc., a manufacturer of high-frequency transmitting tubes located near San Francisco. However, the exact number of VT-158's produced throughout the war remains unknown.  Technical description  The radar utilized the BC-800-B IFF receiver/transponder.  Operational history  The SCR-602 was developed in time to be utilized by the U.S. Army during the invasion of North Africa in November 1942.

The closure was deeply unpopular and became a key campaign issue in the 1982 state government election. Following a change of government, passenger services resumed on 23 July 1983. The re-opening of the railway was the beginning of a shift in metropolitan transport policy that saw bipartisan support for the revitalisation and expansion of Perth's passenger railway system. The campaign against the closure of the railway was led by Peter Newman, a local Government councillor and environmental scientist.  Background  Fremantle railway line at southern side of Fremantle railway bridge Perth’s passenger rail services were believed to have been in serious decline throughout the 1960s and 1970s with reports of passenger numbers falling as commuters switched from public transport to cars and employment moved out of the central city. Calls by various stakeholders for the electrification of the system had been ignored. The 1955 Stephenson- Hepburn Plan had recommended the expansion of the existing rail network into the northern suburbs, however this recommendation was not implemented in the 1963 Metropolitan Region Scheme. Commencing with the 1970 Corridor Plan, successive government reports throughout the 1970s had recommended the closure of the existing rail lines and their replacement with bus services,Director General of Transport Western Australia. (1976). Public Transport in Perth Region A Review Paper for the Minister for TransportDirector General of Transport Western Australia. (1978). Development of the Public Transport System in the Perth Metropolitan Region 1978/79 to 1982/83. Perth: Department of Transport Western Australia. but these recommendations were not acted on by the government at the time. Successive state governments had reduced investment in both passenger and freight rail services over the same period of time with the Court government accelerating the closure of regional services in the late 1970s. This included Albany and Mullewa passenger services in 1976 and 1978 respectively and various freighting services over the same period. Dependent as they were on aging railway stock (some of which dated to the 1930s), passenger rail services were relatively uncomfortable and attracted a declining ridership.Committee for Perth (June 2011) 'What we thought would kill us' Case Study 2: The Evolution of Perth's Passenger Rail System As the rolling stock neared the end of its lifespan, the government of the day was required to consider either a substantial capital works program, or the cessation of passenger services entirely. John Knox, appointed to the Department of Transport in the early 1970s was a key player in the process of consolidating and closing rail services.Newman, Peter (2012) The Perth Rail transformation: some political lessons learned. Light Rail 2011 Conference, 6 April, Sydney. When the closure of the railway was mooted in 1975, 40,000 people signed a petition against it. However the it was again proposed by the Minister for Transport in October 1977.  Announcement of closure (May 1979 – September 1979)  In May 1979, the Court government announced the imminent cessation of passenger railway services along the Fremantle line and the replacement of public transport services with a fleet of articulated buses. Some rolling stock was to be transferred to the Armadale and Midland lines, with a review of the closure to occur within three years. Article from Athol Thomas, The Canberra Times West Australian correspondent on 2 February 1979 supporting the government decision to close the railway. The justification for the cessation of the railway service was that it was uneconomic, inefficient and inflexible in comparison to equivalent bus services. The government pointed to declining passenger numbers and an increase in the annual cost of providing rail services in comparison to buses. The Minister for Transport was quoted as saying it was \\"futile\\" to oppose the decision. The decision was applauded in some quarters and was supported by most transportation experts, but was met with immediate community and local government opposition. Academic and local government councillor Peter Newman and 11 others formed the Friends of the Railways advocacy group for the purpose of opposing the government policy. Within three months of formation, the Friends of the Railway had 400 members.Western Australia, Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Assembly, 29 August 1979, pages 2362–2418 By May, Friends of the Railway had gathered 100,000 signatures on a petition against the closure and prepared a detailed report rebutting arguments in favour of the railway closure and laying out an alternative proposal for the electrification of the system. This garnered widespread media coverage and as protests grew, comparisons were made to the community opposition around the demolition of the Pensioners Barracks. Under pressure from the community and local governments including Fremantle and Subiaco the Minister for Transport announced he would review the submission and present it before cabinet. The Minister requested additional information from Friends of the Railway, which they provide by June. Pressure continued to grow, with the Sunday Independent reporting market research that found 80% of metropolitan voters were against the closure, including 70% of voters who voted Liberal in the last election. Friends of the Railways sought permission from the government to take surveys of passengers on the railways, but the request was denied. On 27 July, the alternative transport proposal was formally rejected by cabinet and the government reiterated its intention to closure the railway on 2 September. This leads to a formal request in August from the railway unions for a parliamentary inquiry, which was denied. On 6 August, Friends of the Railway was the recipient of leaked internal documents from Westrail indicating that the Department of Transport had suppressed reports that contradicted the governments position that electrification of the line was uneconomical. The Minister initially denied the existence of the report, before acknowledging it the next day when photographic evidence was printed by the Daily News. On 17 August it was alleged that the Government disrupted a public Friends of the Railway meeting at the Cottesloe Civic Centre by bussing in Liberal party members to stifle debate. Later in August, a public protest of up to 3000 people marched through Perth and the closure was debated extensively in the Legislative council with the government alleging that “subversive” actors were funding Friends of the Railway, and the opposition accusing the government of a “systematic dismantling” of railway services.Hansard. Legislative Council. 29 August 1979. In their defence, the government claimed to be investing in rail along the Armadale and Midland lines, but that the Fremantle line lacked the population density to support the services.  Cessation of passenger services (September 1979 – July 1983  On 1 September an estimated 1200 people turned out to watch the last train to Fremantle. The following day, public transport services were replaced by 17 articulated buses. Despite widespread cross-political dissatisfaction with the railway closure the government justified the policy as part of an overall investment in public transport and promised that it would be subject to review with three years. The continuation of freight services ensured that the railway line remained operational and so, in spite of a clear swing to Labor, the government won the 1980 election. Over the next three years the replacement bus services failed to attract comparable passenger numbers to the closed railway line. Peter Newman suggests a decline of around 30%. Later reports found total passenger numbers on the rail network bottoming out at 58 million during this time period. In 1982, following the review of the closure, the government released Transport 2000: A Perth Study. This report reaffirmed the government policy and recommended that the Fremantle line remains closed. With the government taking a firm position on the railway closure the Opposition under Brian Burke promised to reopen the line if Labor wins the election.  Change of government  The Labor opposition won the 1983 state government election, entering government for the first time since 1974. In May of the same year Cabinet agreed to honour their election commitment to reopen the Fremantle railway. On 23 July 1983 the Fremantle rail reopened with passenger numbers restored to their pre-1979 levels. At this point the infrastructure and rolling stock was in such a poor state that the government was compelled to investigate the immediate electrification of the entire line, a program that commenced in 1986 and concluded in 1991.

Early years Anastasia Georgiadou was born Ottoman Greek in 1891 in the Büyükdere suburb of Istanbul, then Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire, present-day Turkey. Her father was a Captain of the Ottoman Gendarmerie. At a very young age, she accompanied her instrument-playing father in singing at guest gatherings. Later, she sang to her father's music on a rowboat on Bosphorus off Büyükdere among 20-30 rowboats during full moon at summer nights. She sometimes sang alone in the sea at night. People at the seashore, listening to her singing, nicknamed her (\\"Efthalia the Mermaid\\") from the age of five or six. Professional career She sang cantos and folk songs on stage at the music-performance coffee houses in Galata quarter. Her music career changed after her marriage to Sadi (later Işılay), a notable violinist. She performed together with her husband. Between 1923 and 1926, she recorded her songs for Pathé Records in Paris, France, where she lived with her husband. During this time, she gave concerts in Europe and the Middle East. She was the first non-Muslim singer, who recorded 56 songs of about one hundred works compiled from Anatolia for Columbia Records, on behalf of the Dâr-ül Elhan (\\"House of Melodies\\"), today Istanbul University State Conservatory. To avoid ethnic tensions, she used Turkish pseudonyms instead of her original name on the first 30 or so records she made. The number of her records after 1927 neared 50. After her songs were acclaimed at performances before President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (), from 1930 on she did not avoid using her name. She used the name \\"Deniz Kızı Eftalya\\" on most of her records except for eleven of them. In 1934, she recorded for the label His Master's Voice under the name \\"Eftalya Sadi\\", using her husband's given name as her family name, just before the surname law took effect in Turkey. She was associated with Greek-Turkish master musicians and composers, oud player Yorgo Bacanos (1900–1977) and his brother, kemenche, and oud virtuoso (1888–1950). She was so popular under the nickname \\"Deniz Kızı Eftalya\\" that Aleko Bacanos dedicated to her a composition titled Gel Ey Denizin Nazlı Kızı Nûş-i Şarâb Et (\\"Come on, coy mermaid, drink wine\\") in the Acem-Aşiran melody type. The song became so famous that its cover versions were performed by the Modern Folk Trio and other notable artists several decades later. Retirement and death Eftalya's artistic life of almost 25 years ended with the jubilee night, organized on 4 August 1936 by the \\"Şirket-i Hayriye\\" (today Istanbul City Ferry Line) during a full moon night. Four passenger ferries were decorated, and a stage was constructed on a raft. The ferries sailed from Bebek on the Bosphorus northwards up to Büyükdere, stopping by piers on both sides of the strait. People gathered ashore joined the event with paper lanterns. The program featured also zeibekiko dances, whose music Eftalya enjoyed. She fell ill during the jubilee event, and died in Istanbul on 15 March 1939. She was interred at Şişli Greek Orthodox Cemetery following the religious funeral service at the Hagia Triada Church.

Serving as the sequel to EA Sports UFC 3 (2018), it was released on August 14, 2020 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Gameplay Like its predecessor, UFC 4 is a fighting game based on the mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). There are 229 unique fighters, with 81 alternate versions. The game features a career mode, which was designed to be an \\"onboarding experience\\" to teach the player the basics of five MMA disciplines which include boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, and jiujitsu. The goal of the career mode, which allows players to create their own custom fighter, is to become the G.O.A.T. (which stands for \\"greatest of all time\\"). As players progress in the game, they can choose to accept or decline fights, which will affect the development of the fighter's career. The control scheme was also improved and streamlined to make the game more accessible. Multiplayer modes, including Blitz Battles, and Online World Championships, would also be available. In addition to fighting in the The Octagon, players can also fight in Backyard and Kumite, which resembles an underground fighting arena. However, unlike its predecessor, Ultimate Team would not return in UFC 4. Development The game was officially announced on July 12, 2020. Similar to UFC 3, the game utilized the Real Player Motion technology, which was designed to make clinches believable. The tech also helped create new takedown animations which respond to how players play the game. EA also recruited Daniel Cormier and Jon Anik to provide commentary for the game. Joe Rogan, who provided the commentary for previous games, did not return due to his dislike for providing voice-over for video games. Players who pre-ordered the game would get exclusive access to play as Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua. On the day of announcement, EA also revealed that Israel Adesanya and Jorge Masvidal would be the cover fighters for the game. The game was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on August 14, 2020. The game received an emergency patch in September 2020 to address a major bug.https://www.gamespot.com/amp-articles/ufc-4-gets-an-emergency-update-see- the-patch-notes/1100-6481862/ Reception According to review aggregator Metacritic, the game received generally positive reviews upon release. IGN praised the new submission system and career mode, but said that \\"longstanding problems still remain in the ground game and some dated visuals\\". Push Square stated that it was \\"significantly better\\" that its predecessor, however, Hardcore Gamer said it was \\"fun albeit bland\\". Games Radar praised the clinches but criticised the camera. The game was heavily criticised by fans for the addition of in-game advertisements that were added two weeks after the game's release. A post on Reddit showing advertisements in the game for the second season premiere of the Amazon Prime Video television series The Boys, which included two full-screen pop-ups at the beginning and end of the replay, a smaller pop-up on the timer overlay during gameplay, and the show and service's logos layered in the middle of the Octagon canvas, garnered over 86,000 upvotes as of September 5, 2020.

The magazine was subtitled Zeitschrift für Mode und Kultur (meaning Magazine for fashion and culture in English). It is known as the most famous fashion magazine of East Germany. History and profile Sibylle was launched by photographer Sibylle Gerstner in 1956. She was also the funding editor-in-chief of the magazine of which the goal was first to educate women on how to dress. In 1961 she was replaced by Margot Pfannstiel in the post. Following this change the goal of Sibylle became to encourage feminine elegance and fashion with no political concern. The magazine was published on a bimonthly basis first by the Modeinstitut Berlin and then, by the Verlag für die Frau. Therefore, the headquarters of the magazine moved from Berlin to Leipzig. Sibylle covered brands from East German and other communist countries without featuring those reflecting the Western consumerism. In other words, it never focused on stimulating consumption or creating incentives to buy. However, the magazine did not always represent the official approach of the state, particularly by the late 1960s and during the 1980s. Each issue of the magazine was controlled by the women's commission of the party's central committee before the publication. Ute Mahler who is a photographer and curator and worked for Sibylle argued that East German authorities did not consider the magazine as a significant publication and therefore, censorship was not strict. Nevertheless, some of the issues of Sibylle were not permitted by the East German authorities due to its coverage of women wearing blue jeans or mini skirts and due to featuring smiling models. Although Sibylle was a fashion-oriented magazine, it also covered articles dealing with art, literature, travel, theater and included interviews. The magazine allocated forty pages for fashion-related themes and the remaining forty pages for culture-related subjects. The work by German photographers Roger Melis, Günter Rössler, Werner Mahler and Sibylle Bergmann was frequently featured in the magazine. Arno Fischer was another photographer who worked for Sibylle. His revolutionary fashion photographs showing the models in the middle of the street were first published in the magazine. Dorothea Melis was one of the Fashion editors of the magazine. Following her assignment to the post by Margot Pfannstiel she redesigned and modernized the magazine. In addition to fashion photography, Sibylle included daily life photography which featured not only East Germany but also Eastern Europe countries and the Soviet Union. Those taken in Moscow were very frequent. The magazine became very popular among women due to its coverage of sophisticated self-sewing articles which was very popular in the country at that time. For a long time the circulation of Sibylle was 200,000 copies. Following the reunification of Germany the magazine continued to be published. However, due to financial reasons Sibylle folded in 1995. Legacy In 2001 a documentary film was made about Sibylle. It has also been subject of several exhibitions in different cities of Germany, including Rostock, Rüsselsheim and Cottbus. One of them was in Dresden which opened in April 2018. In June 2019 another exhibition entitled Sibylle – Die Ausstellung was held in Berlin. In 2016 Ute Mahler published a book covering the photographs and other items published in Sibylle.

He has been held in an Egyptian prison since December 2016 without formal charges or a trial. His incarceration is in violation of Egyptian law and has been condemned by international rights groups, media freedom organisations and the United Nations. Career Hussein was born on 12 December 1966 in the Giza Governorate village of Zawiyat Abo Musallam. He attended Cairo University and graduated with two degrees in political science and law. Hussein began his journalism career as a politics editor and then broadcaster for the Voice of the Arabs radio station in Cairo. He joined the state-run Nile TV in 1997 as a political affairs correspondent before a promotion to the channel's head of correspondents. Hussein worked with several Arabic news channels and became Cairo's bureau chief of Sudan TV. He taught news production and editing at the Radio and Television Institute in Cairo. Hussein joined Al Jazeera's Cairo bureau as a correspondent in 2010 after serving as a freelancer for the network. When the Egyptian authorities closed Al Jazeera's Cairo office in 2013, he moved to Al Jazeera's headquarters in Doha to work as a news producer. Arrest and imprisonment On 20 December 2016, Hussein was arrested shortly after his arrival in Egypt while on a personal visit to see his family. He was questioned for 14 hours without a lawyer present and then released. Hussein was arrested for a second time on 23 December 2016 but it was not announced by Egyptian authorities until two days later. Hussein was accused of \\"incitement against state institutions and broadcasting false news with the aim of spreading chaos\\"; the charges were denied by Hussein and the Al Jazeera Media Network (AJMN). Egyptian media circulated information that detailed Hussein as a terrorist and an enemy of the state. Hussein has been held in the maximum-security Tora Prison where he has experienced physical and psychological duress. He was kept in solitary confinement for the first three months after his arrest, where he suffered a broken arm and was refused proper medical treatment. In May 2019, an Egyptian court rejected an order by the state prosecutor to release Hussein. Authorities instead returned Hussein to prison and opened a new investigation into him with unspecified charges. Hussein requested to visit his critically ill father in hospital before the latter's death in November 2019 but was rejected by the prison warden. The Egyptian penal code sets a maximum pre- trial detention period of 620 days for individuals who are investigated for a felony. Hussein reached 1,000 days of illegal detention in September 2019. Hussein shares a cell with three other inmates. He is allowed to have visitors once a week, where his family have observed Hussein's substantial weight loss and developed concerns for his health. Calls for release The Al Jazeera Media Network (AJMN) has consistently denied the charges placed against Hussein and have called for his release. Mostefa Souag, the Acting Director General of AJMN, has called Hussein's case as \\"baseless accusations and trumped-up charges.\\" On the 1,000th day of his illegal detention, Al Jazeera launched a campaign website at FreeMahmoudHussein.com. On 3 February 2018, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) deemed the detention of Hussein as \\"arbitrary\\" and demanded his immediate release. The OHCHR report concluded there is \\"no legal basis in Egyptian law\\" for Hussein's continued pre-trial detention and drew attention to Egyptian authorities' failure to produce justifiable evidence. The International Press Institute and Amman Center for Human Rights Studies have called for Hussein's release. His case has been detailed by the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission.

Published in 1983, the work describes the author’s life from his conversion to Christianity in 1953, at the age of twenty-seven, up to his residency in Vermont at the age of fifty- seven.  Overview  Buechner introduces his second autobiographical work by narrating the years leading up to his attendance at Union Theological Seminary, New York. The author recalls the process of writing his first two novels, A Long Day’s Dying and The Seasons’ Difference, and a brief spell in Europe, during which he met Lewis Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Bernard Berenson, and Alice B. Toklas.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 6-7. Upon returning to New York, Buechner recounts his time at Union, and his encounters with Reinhold Niebuhr, Paul Tillich, Martin Buber, James Muilenberg, Samuel Terrien, Wilhelm Pauck, Cyril Richardson, and Robert McAfee Brown.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 8. Buechner particularly remembers the teaching style of Muilenberg: ‘Up and down the whole length of the aisle he would stride as he chanted the war songs, the taunt songs, the dirges of ancient Israel. With his body stiff, his knees bent, his arms scarecrowed far to either side, he never merely taught the Old Testament but was the Old Testament.’Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 15. When Buechner met Judith, the woman who was to be his wife, it was Muilenberg who officiated their wedding: ‘[his] hands trembled so as he read the service’.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 34. Alongside his studies, Buechner also recalls the time he spent serving at a church-run ‘employment clinic’ in East Harlem, and the stories of those whom he met while working thereBuechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 22. – an experience that the author memorialised in his third novel, The Return of Ansel Gibbs. Now and Then further recounts Buechner’s experiences as a chaplain and Theology teacher at the Philips Exeter Academy, and the completion of his fourth novel, The Final Beast. Here Buechner expounds upon the place that his new-found faith had come to hold in his work as a novelist: ‘I am a Christian novelist in the same sense that somebody from Boston or Chicago is an American novelist. I must be true to my experience as a Christian as black writers to their experience as blacks or women writers to their experience as women. It is no more complicated, no more sinister than that.’Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 60. Following nine years spent at Exeter, the author then describes the relocation of his family to Vermont, where he completed his fifth novel, The Entrance to Porlock (1970). In this third and final chapter, Buechner also remembers being invited to deliver the Noble Lectures at Harvard (out of which he would publish The Alphabet of Grace), and his conception of the character of Leo Bebb, who became the central focus of his next four books, a tetralogy titled The Book of Bebb: Lion Country (1971), Open Heart (1972), Love Feast (1974), and Treasure Hunt (1977). Finally, the author recalls his discovery of hagiography, and with it his encounter with St Godric of Finchdale, which would eventually become his tenth novel, Godric.  Themes  In Now and Then, Buechner develops the key theme that had been central to his first autobiographical work, The Sacred Journey: the concept of listening. In the final chapter he writes: ‘Listen to your life. All moments are key moments.’Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 92. At the heart of this concept is the notion that ‘if God speaks to us at all other than through such official channels as the Bible and the church, then I think that he speaks to us largely through what happens to us’.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 3. ‘What I have done both in this book and its predecessor’, he continues, ‘is to listen back over what has happened to me […] for the sound, above all else, of his voice.’Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 3. With this theme in mind, the title for this second memoir, Now and Then, is drawn from a quote by Paul Tillich: ‘We want only to show you something we have seen and tell you something we have heard […] that here and there in the world and now and then in ourselves is a New Creation.’Paul Tillich, The New Being (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1955), pp.17-18. Commenting upon Buechner's memoirs, scholar Dale Brown writes that the autobiographical works ‘illustrate Buechner’s theory of what he calls the “sacred function of memory” – the obliteration of the artificial designations of past, present, and future in order to reinhabit and reunderstand the moments of our lives.’Brown, W. Dale. (2006). The Book of Buechner : a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 255.

The Battle  The Mannerheim Line had been pierced in the Second Battle of Summa and Field Marshal Mannerhein had ordered on 15 February a general retreat to the Intermediate line. However, the effective deployment of the Red Army also broke through the Intermediate line and the Finnish troops were allowed to retreat further to the line Vyborg (Viipuri)– Tali – Noskuanselkä – Kuparsaari – Vuoksi on 27 February 1940. The Soviet 7th Army under command of Kirill Meretskov, was now ordered to launch a two-sided flank movement and a direct frontal attack. The 10th and 28th Rifle Corps were to advance west of Vyborg across the frozen Vyborg Bay and the 19th Rifle Corps was to advance east of the city. The 34th and 50th Rifle Corps attacked directly towards Vyborg. Despite many problems, the troops of the Northwest Front advanced to Vyborg, and on the morning of 10 March, the 28th Rifle Corps seized a bridgehead at Vilajoki, which was over five kilometers wide. At the same time, units of Cherevichenko's cavalry began advancing on the ice of the Gulf of Finland and concentrated on the island of Piisaari, from where he was preparing to bypass the city of Vyborg. However, flooded areas, supply problems and constant Finnish counterattacks prevented the Red Army from achieving any more visible progress, and until 12 March, the fighting was so intense that both sides in this area reached a state of complete exhaustion. On 13 March, the Finnish delegation finally accepted Molotov's peace conditions in Moscow, allowing the ceasefire at 12:00.

At present, the hydropower station is still operating normally, and the more than 20 million kWh of electricity that it keeps producing each year is still being delivered to parts of China. History In 1908 (Qing Dynasty, Year 34 of Guangxu), wealthy Yunnan merchant Wang Xiaozhai (王筱斋), also known as Wang Hongtu (王鸿图), took the lead in recruiting commercial stocks to prepare for the construction of the plant. In July 1910, the construction of the plant began, with a total installed capacity of 480 kilowatts, and on the evening of May 28, 1912, the hydropower station officially generated electricity, using 22kV transmission lines to supply power to Kunming, which was 32 kilometers away from the power station. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Air Force bombed the Shilongba Hydropower Station four times from 1939 to 1941, but still failed to destroy the power supply. Since 2002, four small fertilizer and chemical plants located upstream of the Shilongba Hydropower Station have discharged excessive sewage into the Tanglang River, causing serious corrosion of the station's equipment and forcing it to shut down on 14 October 2003 and resume power generation on December 10, 2003.

He held this position from 1792 to 1807 and again from 1821 until his death in 1833; in the years between, the bakufu exerted direct control over the whole of Ezo, while the Matsumae clan were relocated to Yanagawa Domain. He was successor to his father Matsumae Michihiro and succeeded in turn by his grandson Matsumae Yoshihiro. Names He originally went by the name of and was also known as . Biography Matsumae Akihiro was born in An'ei 4 (1775), the eldest son of Matsumae Michihiro, eighth daimyō of Matsumae Domain. In Kansei 4 (1792), his father stepping aside, he became the ninth daimyō. Alerted to the question of the northern frontier by the arrival of Russian and British ships (under Adam Laxman and William Robert Broughton respectively), in 1799 the bakufu assumed direct control over eastern Ezo. Initially the bakufu was to be directly responsible for the area from Urakawa to the Shiretoko Peninsula, and the nearby islands, for a fixed term of seven years; however, since access to this region via Hakodate was still through Domain territory, this caused teething issues for both parties; and so, later that same year, the Domain was asked to relinquish also all the area east from the on the Oshima Peninsula to Urakawa (i.e., including Hakodate). His domain thus greatly reduced, Matsumae Akihiro was compensated with the grant of lands in Musashi Province, in what is now Kuki, Saitama Prefecture, to the value of five thousand koku. In Kyōwa 2 (1802), the bakufu decided to take permanent control of eastern Ezo, establishing the Hakodate bugyō, the Matsumae clan receiving a gift of 3,500 ryō of gold in return. In Bunka 2 (1805), learning that Nikolai Rezanov, on his return from Nagasaki, had met with officials of the Matsumae Domain and a number of Ainu, the bakufu sent out to inspect the state of affairs in Matsumae and western Ezo. Taken ill upon his arrival in Matsumae that winter, he returned to Edo, journeying north again in 1806, his tour of inspection taking him from Matsumae to Sōya, before he returned to Edo once more. Concluding that the Matsumae Domain was unable to protect the norther borders, in 1807 the bakufu decided Matsumae Akihiro should hand back Matsumae and western Ezo, so as directly to control the entirety of Ezo. Matsumae Akihiro was consequently transferred to Yanagawa Domain in Mutsu province, in what is now Date, Fukushima Prefecture, the fief valued at 9,000 koku. In Bunsei 4 (1821), Matsumae Akihiro was returned to his former fief in Ezo. The following year, he founded the han school. Passing away in Tenpō 4 (1833), he was succeeded by his grandson Matsumae Yoshihiro, his son Chikahiro having died in 1827; another of Matsumae Akihiro's fourteen children, by more than one lady, Matsumae Takahiro, would later become the twelfth daimyō. Matsumae Akihiro's grave may be found amongst those of the other Matsumae daimyō at in Matsumae.

Writing process  The model of the writing process is divided into three major processes: Planning, Writing, and Reviewing. The Artifice is designed to encourage collaboration between writers on each phase. To help writers find a good topic to explore, the platform offers Topics. With this feature, writers can explore user submitted topics and also make their own topic suggestions. Once an article has been submitted for review, it will be available for processing by upper-tier writers who can provide helpful feedback to improve the content. The peer-reviewed editorial system is in place to make sure published articles contain high-quality content, formatting unity, and professional credibility. Once a writer gets published, they gain the ability to process submissions, work in collaboration with prospective writers, and thus decide what type of material meets their own standards.

Early years (1891–1919) Marcel Alphonse Joseph Maquet was born in Huy, Liège Province, Belgium on 1 November 1891. His parents were Alfred Maquet and Céline Lomba. In 1913 he obtained his bachelor's degree in Commercial and Consular Sciences from the University of Liège. During World War I (1914–1918) he was mobilized on 29 July 1914 in the 14th line regiment. He took part in the fighting near Liège. He was made a prisoner at Boncelles and was taken to Germany. After the war he studied at the colonial school and was admitted as a colonial administrator 2nd class. Junior colonial administrator (1919–1930) Maquet began his service in Boma on 19 June 1919, and was assigned to the Yokolo Territory in Équateur Province. He managed to calm a troubled region where the factoreries had burned the land and destroyed the culture. The authorities and the local people appreciated his sense of diplomacy and his composure. He was promoted to territorial administrator 1st class in 1922, assistant district commissioner in 1925, chef de service of Indigenous Affairs and Labor (Affaires indigènes et Main-d'œuvre, AIMO) in 1927 and director-general of AIMO in 1931. He helped organize the chiefdoms and the workforce, improved the roads and developed cotton cultivation in Équateur. He suggested regulation for the copal trade. Maquet married Jeanne Maquet-Tombu (1893-1978), who accompanied him to the Congo in 1930. She was known as a pastel artist, had a doctorate in Art History and Archeology and was also an author. In 1936 her book Le siècle marche won the Triennial Prize for Colonial Literature. Maquet conducted ethnographic inquiries into Bokanja and Bolanda in the Bokungu Territory in 1925. He and Martin De Ryck conducted an ethnographic inquiry in Lionje in the Boende Territory in 1926/1930. District commissioner (1939–1940) Macquet was made district commissioner 2nd class on 1 January 1930. In 1933 he was appointed the principal district commissioner in Léopoldville. Macquet took an interest in locally made ivory carvings and tools, some dating to the pre-colonial period, and later wrote about them in the journal of the Musée de la vie indigène in Leopoldville. In a letter of 5 December 1939 to Governor General Pierre Ryckmans Maquet opposed clemency for former leaders of the Kimbanguist movement had converted to the Salvation Army, since they distorted the teachings of the Salvation Army in their speeches to large crowds, and continued to support the movement. On 20 December 1939 vice-governor Paul Ermens wrote to Maquet about the relegation of Simon-Pierre Mpadi before the opening of the Agricultural Colony of Boende. He said Mpadi was one of the main leaders of the \\"Mission des Noirs\\", many of whose members were former Kimbanguists. They were concealing xenophobic views behind a pretense of loyalty to the authorities but a desire for autonomy of their church. This was considered very dangerous. Provincial commissioner / governor (1940–1945) Maquet was appointed commissioner of Stanleyville Province on 18 November 1940, replacing Rodolphe Dufour. In 1941 the title was changed to governor of Stanleyville Province. He was responsible for a province where a large number of colonial troops were stationed with a view to possible intervention in Abyssinia. Some of the Europeans were angry at the delay in taking action, but Maquet and General Auguste Gilliaert managed to calm the situation. As in Équateur, Maquet made social and economic improvements in Stanleyville. In March 1943 Maquet was recalled to take over the government of the Léopoldville province. He left Stanleyville on 10 March 1943, replaced by Alexis Bertrand. He replaced Albert-Émile de Beauffort as governor of Léopoldville Province. He left this position in 1945, and was replaced in 1946 by Léon Morel. He retired on 27 December 1945. Later career (1945–1960) After retiring from active service, Maquet became a member of the Colonial Council in 1946, vice-president of the Office of African Cities and permanent member of the UNESCO commission in Belgium.

This series tells the story of a young girl who became Grand Empress Dowager of the Sheng Kingdom. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/world/asia/china-films-movies- hengdian.html Plot Helan MingYu is a princess from the YongLin kingdom, prophetized to become Empress. Helan MingYu and Xiao ChengXu met when they were young and fell in love. They had planned a future together. Xiao ChengRui saved a girl whom he was mislead to believe was Helan MingYu. When he met Helan MingYu, he started taking a liking to her. Upon hearing the gossip about when Helan MingYu was little and was prophetized to become mother of all under heaven, he thought it practical to marry her. He dispatched his empress to persuade Helan MingYu into accepting the emperor. She was reluctant. But when news of Xiao ChengXu's death in battle spread across the kingdom, she accepted her fate and decided to marry the new emperor, Xiao ChengRui. On the day of her wedding, news came that Xiao ChengXu was alive but it was too late as MingYu felt a duty (as many lives were on the line) to go through with the wedding to Xiao ChengRui. This decision sealed her fate and put her on a path where she had to use her wits and knowledge of the art of war to navigate court and harem intrigue to secure her son and her grandson's throne thus becoming Empress Dowager and eventually Grand Empress Dowager. Xiao ChengXu was taken under the wings of his third brother, Prince Xiao ChengRui, since he was little. Despite being born from different mothers, they had a very strong bond until the passing of their father, the Emperor of Sheng. Emperor of Sheng passed away without a written edict as to whom he passes the crown on to - he only left a verbal edict with Consort Mu. This set off a series of scheming and events that pitted brothers against each other. More so was the conflict between once devoted brothers, Xiao ChengXu and Xiao ChengRui. Xiao ChengXu vowed to take back what is rightfully his (the throne and his love) so he built up his military power and influence in the court. In a confrantation, his 3rd brother scolded him and told him he does not have what it takes to be emperor - he is not emperor material. Over time he had so many missed opportunities to seize the throne - is it fate? Xiao ChengRui thought he was groomed by his father to become the next emperor to the realization that he was not named as his successor. For all his hard work and many years of bravery in battles by his father's side, he felt entitled and that he was best suited to become the next emperor so when the opportunity was offered to him, he mulled over the sanctity of what they would embark on to make it happen. Eventually he gave in to his deep seeded ambitions and usurped the throne from his unbeknowst brother. It seemed Xiao ChengRui was destined to take all. And he took all, but he could not win the heart of a woman he wanted so dearly thus began a game of cat and mouse and his rapid decline into narcissism. Towards the end of his life, while playing a last game of chess with Helan MingYu, he told her that for once he would win her. He set up a scheme by whom he chose as his successor so that he could ensure his Sheng kingdom does not fall and does not end up usurped by Xiao ChengXu. To stabilize the court, Xiao ChengXu was convinced by Helan MingYu to assist the young Xiao QiYuan as Emperor. He was persuaded to not take the throne but instead become regent to the emperor thus having all of the unlimited power just without the title of emperor. He eventually agreed. However, he cannot suppress his feelings for Helan Mingyu and desires to marry her. As Xiao QiYuan grows older, he begins to suspect Xiao ChengXu of having a love affair with his mother. His suspicion eventually leads to Xiao ChengXu's death in battle. Helan Mingyu is conflicted, but puts her kingdom above her personal desires. Xiao QiYuan isn't content with his life after being forced to marry a woman he doesn't love. His favorite consort, Dong RuoXuan passes away from illness and he dies of grief. Helan MingYu eventually becomes Grand Empress Dowager, and helps her grandson ascend to the throne.

Biography Rothschild was born on June 14, 1861 in Eufaula, Alabama, the son of Amanda (née Blun) and Frank Rothschild. He spent most of his childhood in Columbus, Georgia. His grandfather, Nathan Blun, was a prosperous merchant in New York City and Rothschild's family moved to Manhattan in the 1870s. Rothschild attended P.S. 35, the Packard School of Business, and then graduated with a degree in business from the College of the City of New York. In 1878, he went to work at his grandfather's manufacturing business and in 1887, he founded S.F. & A. Rothschild with his brother. On April 1, 1893, Rothschild in partnership with Nathan Straus and Isidor Straus (who was married to Rothschild's aunt, Ida Blun Straus), bought out Joseph Wechsler's interest in Wechsler & Abraham, co-founded by Rothschild's father- in-law Abraham Abraham, and changed the store's name to Abraham & Straus.

He fell from favour and died in prison after a new emperor came to power.  Biography  Franz Gotthardi was probably born in Pest. It was in Pest that he built his career as a businessman and opened a coffeehouse. One source identifies him as a \\"formerly bankrupted coffee trader\\" During the time of Emperor Joseph II Gotthardi emerged as a police officer becoming a government advisor and, in 1787, head of the police service in Pest, creating a network of agents and informants. In 1790 the emperor died and, according to at least one source, the \\"Josephine system\\" of surveillance collapsed. The emperor died childless and the imperial crown therefore passed to his younger brother, Leopold II. The French Revolution which had been unfolding since 1789 had made the government intensely nervous. The well-publicised and intensifying difficulties of the emperor's youngest sister between 1789 and her execution by guillotine in 1793 made it personal. Meanwhile, Franz Gotthardi found himself having to relocate from Pest to Vienna where he was installed by the new emperor as a director of the Court Theatre (\\"Burgtheater\\") at an annual salary of 2,100 florins. The theater directorship was a cover which may or not have convinced observers. He became an imperial advisor. By the first part of 1791 Franz Gotthardi was installed as head of the Imperial Secret Police. Government policy was driven by a terror of secret organisations that might be conspiring to re-run the Storming of the Bastille and its ever more alarming aftermath in Vienna. For Gotthardi there was a focus on recruiting agents and informants, an activity in which he was presumably already well versed on account of his work during the 1780s in Pest. Principal targets included freemasons, Jesuits and others identified as \\"Illuminati\\". Given the shadowy nature of the world in which Gotthardi operated, it is unsurprising that many details of his work remain undisclosed. One high-profile recruit known to posterity is the politician, and a leader of the so-called \\"Hungarian Jacobin\\" movement, Ignác Martinovics, who was reportedly an exceptionally productive intelligence agent. Another, known to posterity as much for his legacy as a dramatist as for his espionage work up till 1792, was Leopold Alois Hoffmann, was Gotthardi's friend Leopold Alois Hoffmann. The two men had originally met in Pest, where Hoffmann held an academic post between 1785 and 1790, and had together returned to Vienna in 1790 as the political weather further downriver became dangerously heated for members of the German-speaking minority with a significant public profile. By the time of his death in 1795 Franz Gotthardi had become something of a hate figure in certain quarters. He had quickly built up a network of agents whose professional duties included both reporting on \\"public opinion\\" and manipulating it. There are hostile references to his having diligently encouraged espionage and imposed a brutal police system, while clamping down on press freedom. The Emperor Leopold died unexpectedly on 1 March 1790, having served as emperor for slightly more than two years. The imperial crown passed on to a new generation. It is clear that Gotthardi never enjoyed the close working relationship with the young Emperor Francis that he had established with the emperor's late father. At some point between 1792 and 1795 the emperor dispensed with the services of his father's spy chief. During 1794/95 Gotthardi was caught up in a lawsuit triggered by the recently uncovered \\"Jacobin conspiracy\\" His former top agent, Ignác Martinovics, was charged and convicted for setting up two republican secret clubs: one for aristocratic members, and one for members with bourgeois background. Martinovics was found to have stirred up a revolt among the Hungarian serfs, and to have set up four regionally based directorates. Gotthardi, as the intelligence boss of Martinovics, fell under suspicion. On the night of 23/24 July 1795 both men were among those arrested in Vienna. Martinovics reportedly believed that the authorities must already know more than they did, and promptly made a full confusion in the hope of improving his situation. Gotthardi was clearly aware of the activities of the \\"Jacobin\\" conspirators organised by Martinovics, and though there is no indication that he ever conspired with them, it also appears that he never betrayed them to the regular security services. Of the 42 republican club members arrested and convicted, six were executed on 20 May 1795. Martinovics was one of these.Tomasz Kamusella: The Politics of Language and Nationalism in Modern Central Europe, Publisher: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009, Franz Gotthardi was not among those executed: instead he received a 35-year prison sentence. According to at least one source, it was as a consequence of the conditions under which he was held in prison that Franz Gotthardi died, probably during the final part of July 1795, less than six months after his sentencing.

He took care of Hans Christian Andersen when the later writer first arrived in Copenhagen as a child and remained his loyal friend and supporter for the remainder of his life. He was also involved in the foundation of the Thorvaldsen Museum. Early life and education Collin was born in Copenhagen, the son of director of the Royal Danish Class Lottery Niels Collin (1736–97) and Ingeborg Bolten (1735–1817). He grew up in the Collin House in Bredgade. He was taught at home, first by his parents and then by private teachers, including Christopher Frimann Omsen and the priest Michael Gottlieb Birckner. He studied law at the University of Copenhagenm graduating in 1795. Career Collin's first job was in his father's office. This left him with enough time to study foreign languages and follow lectures on philosophy, mathematics and physics at the university. In 1800, he passed the examination in surveying. He was a member of Drejer's Club where many of the leading writers of the time met and was himself a contributor to Knud Lyne Rahbek's Minerva and other journals. Collin left the Class Lottery when his father died. His contacts among high-ranking civil servants got him a position as a volunteer in the Treasury (Rentekammeret) where he mainly worked in the agriculture departments. In 801, he was appointed as first copyist and then clerk. In 1807, he was appointed as bank commissioner and in 1812 as Assessor in Finanskollegiet and in 1916 as a finance deputy (deputeret for finanserne). He worked under first Ernst Schimmelmann and then Johan Sigismund von Møsting. From early in his career, Collin had thoughts about a fundamental reorganization of the central administration. In 1815 he anonymously published as short article in Minerva in which he mocked the indolent and incompetent civil servants who only thought of their work as long as they were in their offices instead of \\"bringing it along wherever they go, going to bed with it at night and getting up with it in the morning\\". In the same articles, he proposed to place the responsibility for the government's government spending and incomes in a single department. On several occasions, personally, he in vain presented the same idea to Møsting. He was a member of the important finance commission which was established in 1836 under the leadership of Adam Wilhelm Moltke. He was a member of the Treasury from 1831–40 He retired in December 1848. Collin and H.

Collin was a member of Landhusholdningsselskabet from 1805 and served as president of the association from 1809–55. Culture Collin was secretary for the foundation ad usus publicos from 1803 to 1833. This brought him in contact with most of the leading cultural figures of the time. He was a co-founder of Athenæum and Selskabet til naturlærens udbredelse. In 1841, he became an honorary member of Academy of Fine Arts. Personal life Collin married Henriette Christine Birckner, née Hornemann, (c. 26 November 1772 – 21 May1845) on 13 November 1803 in Ledøje Church.

The mural was commissioned by the museum's first director (monikered \\"The Keeper of the Tate\\"), Charles Aitken for the re-opening of the institution's restaurant where to this day it forms the entire interior surround of what is now the eponymously named eatery, \\"The Rex Whistler Restaurant\\". The work has been at the center of controversy in recent years over the artist's depiction of a black child chained to and running behind a horse and cart and images of Chinese people deemed to read as stereotypical. When the restaurant re-opened with the mural completed it was described by its publicity as \\"the most amusing room in Europe\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20120626005002/http://www.tate.org.uk/about/our- work/collection/about-the-collection/works-in-the-fabric-of-tate- buildings/rex-whistler-expedition-in-pursuit-of-rare-meats However the organization The White Pube began a campaign against the mural on Instagram .

The idea for a mural in the establishment was first come up with by the antiques dealer Joseph Doveen who donated £500 to the nascent effort.http://tdclassicist.blogspot.com/2012/09/rex-whistler-murals.html?m=1 Rex Whistler was recommended for the job, submitted drawings, and was chosen for the project in 1926 while he was still a student at the Slade School of Art. He was paid £5 a day over the 18 months it took to complete the work. The action depicted in the mural takes place in the fictive land of \\"Epicurania\\" ruled over by the \\"Duke of Epicurania\\". The content of the mural was created in a collaboration between Whistler and the novelist Edith Olivier (1872-1948). The story articulated in the work depicts an account wherein an \\"expedition\\" of a group of seven people departs in search of exotic meats. They travel on all manner of transport; bicycles, carts and horses from their point of departure (the) \\"Duchy of Epicurania\\", and venture through bizarre and enchanting lands while coming upon creatures such as; unicorns, truffle dogs and two giant gluttons guarding the entrance to a cave. The tale finishes with the adventurers arriving back to an ebullient welcome, and the menu of the Epicuranians, which had previously consisted of dry biscuits, is forever changed.\\" The mural had restoration work done to it in 2014 during a £45 million museum revamp.https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/04/tate-removes- reference-to-amusing-restaurant-after-racist-images-in-mural-draw-anger References Category:British paintings Category:1927 paintings Category:1927 in art ","title":"The Expedition in Pursuit of Rare Meats"},{"id":"64786031","text":"390px Detail The Trinity Triptych is a 1513 oil on panel painting by Domenico Beccafumi, now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale in Siena Anna Maria Francini Ciaranfi, Beccafumi, Sadea Editore/Sansoni, Firenze 1967.. Beccafumi's earliest surviving painting, it was produced as the altarpiece for the Cappella del Manto in the Santa Maria della Scala hospital complex, where it remained until 1818. This influenced the choice of Cosmas and Damian as two of the accompanying saints, flanking John the Baptist and John the Evangelist. The artist also produced a fresco cycle for that chapel, of which only Joachim and Anna Meeting at the Golden Gate survives. A prestigious work in light of the commissioning institution's importance and wealth, it showed Beccafumi's welcome back to Siena (he had just returned from Rome at the time). A cartouche on the frame records the work was commissioned by Battista d'Antonio da Ceva \\"for his devotion[s]\\". As shown in documents rediscovered by Samminiatelli, the work was delivered between February and March 1513 at a fee no greater than 35 florins.

The North Korean campaigned against the previous white minority government and provided military training to ANC rebels in camps in Angola. In August 1998, after the end of apartheid, North Korea and South Africa formally established diplomatic relations. Both countries agreed to maintain non-residential relations at ambassadorial level.

Shepley was given credit for having expanded Time Inc. into different areas of publishing and into television and video. Early life and career Shepley was born on August 16, 1917, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He attended Camp Hill High School in the Harrisburg area, from where he was graduated in 1935. He then was admitted to nearby Dickinson College, where he was in the class of 1939. There he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. Shepley had found a first position in newspapers at the local The Harrisburg Daily Patriot, which his father had been the editor of. He had also been a stringer for the Associated Press in Harrisburg. After completing his second year at Dickinson he dropped out in 1936, becoming a cub reporter for The Pittsburgh Press. He was still working there as of 1937. In 1937 he married the former Jean Stevens from Camp Hill. They would have two sons and two daughters together. Following his time in Pittsburgh, he got a job working for United Press Associations, first covering the Pennsylvania General Assembly in Harrisburg from 1937 to 1940. He then went to Washington, D.C., in 1940, where he covered the U.S. Congress for United Press. World War II and aftermath In 1942 he began working for Time magazine's Washington bureau. He then became a war correspondent for Time and Life magazine. He covered the South-East Asian theatre of World War II. In January 1944 he and several other reporters went to Deogarh, Madhya Pradesh, to meet with Brigadier General Frank Merrill, who was showcasing a new U.S. Army long-range penetration special operations jungle warfare unit that had been training in India. The reporters sat around trying to think of an appealing name for the unit that would enthuse the American public; Shepley suggested \\"Merrill's Marauders\\", and that name became the one the unit has always been known by. Shepley did not join Merrill's unit for its insertion into the Burma campaign, however, instead moving on to a different assignment. Shepley also reported from the South West Pacific theatre of World War II, as well as the European theatre of World War II, where he covered the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. During that battle he was briefly caught behind German lines. In 1945 he was commissioned as a captain in the Army, as part of the General Staff Corps, and was detailed to the personal staff of Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall. In that role he accompanied Marshall to the Potsdam Conference and also helped him write an official report regarding the war. In 1946 he was an attaché on the Marshall Mission to China, a mission that attempted, but failed, to negotiate creation of a truce and a unified government between the Communist Party of China and the nationalist Kuomintang. Bureau chief and book author Subsequently, in 1946 Shepley returned to Time Inc. as a diplomatic correspondent back in Washington. In 1948 he became chief of the Washington bureau, a position he continued to hold into the 1950s. The prominence of his position, his wartime reporting, and his past association with Marshall, all combined to give Shepley unusual access to the U.S. defense and diplomatic establishments. By 1953, American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer had taken stances related to the development of the hydrogen bomb and the value and morality of strategic bombardment that led to a concerted effort against Oppenheimer undertaken by the United States Air Force and other elements of the defense and atomic energy establishments.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 127ff. Several Time-Life publications were involved in this and Shepley's role in orchestrating the anti-Oppenheimer effort was seen with dismay by at least one former Time Inc. executive. This work then grew into a book that Shepley wrote together with a former submariner who was a reporter on his staff, Clay Blair Jr. The resulting Shepley and Blair work, The Hydrogen Bomb: The Men, The Menace, The Mechanism (1954), provoked considerable controversy at the time with its charges that the U.S. development of the hydrogen bomb had been intentionally delayed by some scientists led by Oppenheimer and that the Los Alamos Laboratory had been infiltrated by Communists. While the book was positively reviewed across a large number of newspapers and magazines at the time of publication,Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, p. 141. several scientists who had worked at Los Alamos on the bomb's development soon issued statements refuting its narrative. Interviews conducted during the mid-to- late-1950s (but not published until many decades later) showed almost no scientists speaking well of the book, even those (including physicist Edward Teller) portrayed favorably within it.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 142, 144, 189n61. Subsequent scholarship has established that the Shepley and Blair account was largely inaccurate,Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 139–143. and moreover, that it was guided by stark H-bomb proponent, and Oppenheimer antagonist, Lewis Strauss.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 144–147.McMillan, Ruin of J. Robert Oppenheimer, pp. 245–247, 312n10, 312–313n15. In 1956, Shepley interviewed Secretary of State John Foster Dulles for Life magazine, and Dulles told him that during the Eisenhower administration the United States had on three occasions been on the \\"brink\\" of war \\"and looked it in the face\\" (the instances were in Korea during the armistice talks in June 1953, Indochina in April 1954, and the Formosa Straits in late 1954–early 1955). The Dulles remark gained considerable attention and the phrase \\"brinkmanship\\" became part of Cold War vocabulary. Shepley left the Washington bureau chief position in 1957 to run Times North American news service. On a Time-Life photo shoot in 1957 Shepley met model Yvonne Hudson, originally from California.See resulting photographs of Yvonne McCuskey at this Life page, photographer Hank Walker. Retrieved August 8, 2020. They subsequently married. She had three daughters, from a previous marriage to World War II fighter ace Elbert Scott McCuskey, whom the Shepleys raised together under his last name. The couple also had a daughter of their own. As the 1960 United States presidential election got underway, Shepley took a leave of absence in 1959 to act as an advisor to the campaign of Vice President Richard M. Nixon, who was running for president and became the Republican Party nominee. In that capacity he worked for Nixon's unofficial campaign manager, Leonard W. Hall, and alongside other Nixon aides such as James Bassett. One of Shepley's assignments during the summer of 1960 was to negotiate with the U.S. State Department to request alternative funding for Tom Mboya's plan to send Kenyan students to American universities. Shepley obtained a commitment, but those running the program followed their original plan of accepting money from the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation instead. Thus began the Kennedy Airlift, to the political benefit of Nixon's general election rival, Senator John F. Kennedy. Publishing executive Following Nixon's defeat, Shepley returned to Time Inc., but this time to the business side of the publishing enterprise. He had no business training of any formal nature. He became an executive, first being assistant publisher of Life magazine. Then by 1964, he was publisher of Fortune magazine. Following that, he became publisher of Time magazine, which he was by 1967. Finally in 1969 he became president of Time Inc. During this period he lived in Port Washington, New York, and then in Sands Point, New York. As an executive, he was known as \\"Brass Knuckles Shepley\\" for his blunt and aggressive management style. Indeed, Time Inc.'s own acknowledgement of his passing called him a \\"brusque but decisive manager\\". Well-known Time-Life political correspondent Hugh Sidey said that \\"Shepley was a great boss – tough, curt, no-nonsense but absolutely loyal. He put his faith in reporters and let them go.\\" During his time as president, Shepley worked closely with chairman of the board Andrew Heiskell and editor-in-chief Hedley Donovan. Time Inc. began Money magazine in 1972, People magazine in 1974, and brought back Life magazine as a monthly in 1978. It acquired the Book of the Month Club. Shepley oversaw the acquisitions of Temple Industries and Inland Container Corporation, two companies in the pulp and paper industry, which were subsequently spun off to form Temple-Inland. Most significantly, during the mid-1970s Time Inc. cultivated Home Box Office (HBO) as the first nation-wide pay television service. Shepley publicly proclaimed what he saw as the potential of HBO back when it was first a small regional service in Wilkes-Barre and a couple of similar towns in eastern Pennsylvania, saying in early 1973, \\"Time Inc. has long been intrigued with this method of communication. Initial marketing results indicate a bright role for subscription television. It seems clear that people are willing to pay fair prices to see television programs of their choice which are free of commercials.\\" Time Inc. subsequently bought American Television and Communications in 1977, which became its cable television property. Shepley's personal role seeing a corporate vision for HBO and an overall cable strategy was of decisive importance. Shepley's successor as Time Inc. president, J. Richard Munro, has said, \\"Without any doubt, Jim was the father of HBO. He nurtured it and believed in it. The same was true in cable television, with American Television and Communications.\\" Not all of Shepley's actions worked out. Shepley was the motivating force behind Time Inc.'s purchase of the money-losing Washington Star for $28 million in 1978, convincing Time's board of directors that owning a daily newspaper in the capital would bring a unique sense of prestige. Despite the paper's labor unions agreeing to work concessions that Shepley demanded, the acquisition failed, as the Star lost a further $85 million before the board shut it down in 1981. Shepley stepped down as president of Time Inc. in 1980. He remained on the board of directors, serving as chair of the board's executive committee, until he retired in 1982. Final years and death Shepley lived in Hartfield, Virginia, after leaving Time Inc. During his retirement he served on the boards of the South Street Seaport Museum, the Pullman Transportation Company, the Henley Group, the Hilton Hotels Corporation, and The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. Shepley died at age 71 of cancer at the M.D. Anderson Clinic in Houston, Texas, on November 2, 1988. Awards and honors Shepley received an honorary degree from, and gave a commencement address at, Dickinson College in 1959. He received an honorary degree from Clarkson College of Technology in 1966. And he received an honorary degree, and gave a commencement address, at the University of Florida in 1978. In 1967, Shepley served as national chair for Dickinson College's fund-raising challenge program in association with the Ford Foundation. The James R. Shepley HBO Communications Center in Hauppauge, New York, is where HBO program signals are sent up to a communications satellite.

He was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945, when he led the country to victory in the Second World War, and again from 1951 to 1955. Apart from two years between 1922 and 1924, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1900 to 1964. Ideologically an economic liberal and imperialist, he was for most of his career a member of the Conservative Party, as leader from 1940 to 1955. He was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924. Fundamental ideology The historian Roger Hermiston writes that, when forming his national coalition government in May 1940, it helped Churchill that his own career had \\"never been circumscribed by party affiliation\\". He had begun as a Conservative, defected to the Liberals for twenty years and then returned to the Conservatives. Stuart Ball asserts that he was always comfortable with the idea of governing coalitions. Churchill was perceived by some observers to have been largely motivated by personal ambition rather than political principle, and he lacked \\"permanent commitment to any party\\". While Robert Rhodes James wrote that Churchill was \\"fundamentally a very conservative man\\", Martin Gilbert considered him to be always \\"liberal in outlook\\". Roy Jenkins believed that, whether Churchill was conservative or liberal, he invariably opposed socialism, except that he was completely reliant on the help and support of his Labour Party ministers in the wartime coalition. Churchill was wary of socialist tendencies toward state planning and bureaucracy, because he consistently believed in both the liberty of the individual and of free markets. Paul Addison asserts, however, that Churchill was paradoxically supportive of trade unionism, which he saw as the \\"antithesis of socialism\\". While Churchill was in some respects a radical and a reformer, it was not from any desire to challenge existing social structure, but to preserve it. He could not empathise with the poor, so instead he sympathised with them, displaying what Addison calls the attitude of a \\"benevolent paternalist\\". Monarchism Although Churchill upset both Edward VII and George V during his political career, he was firmly monarchist. Jenkins says Churchill \\"exhibited a romanticised view of the British monarchy\\", and this was especially so in his warm regard for Elizabeth II. His loyalty to Edward VIII almost ruined his political career but, following the abdication, Churchill immediately transferred his loyalty to George VI with whom, despite some initial reservations on the King's side, he formed a close relationship during World War II. Imperialism British Empire at its territorial peak in 1921. Churchill was always an imperialist, with the American historian Edward Adams characterising him as an adherent of \\"liberal imperialism\\". Jenkins says that, as with the monarchy, Churchill held and displayed a romanticised view of the British Empire. Addison says he saw British imperialism as a form of altruism that benefited its subject peoples because \\"by conquering and dominating other peoples, the British were also elevating and protecting them\\". To Churchill, the idea of dismantling the Empire by transferring power to its subject peoples was anathema – especially manifested in his opposition to the Government of India Act 1935 and his acerbic comments about Mahatma Gandhi, whom he called \\"a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir\\". Racial views Some critics have equated Churchill's imperialism with racialism, but Addison among others has argued that it is misleading to describe him as a racist in any modern context because the term as used now bears \\"many connotations which were alien to Churchill\\". Addison points out that Churchill opposed anti-Semitism and would never have tried \\"to stoke up racial animosity against immigrants, or to persecute minorities\\". In 1921, as Secretary of State for the Colonies, Churchill travelled to Mandatory Palestine where he declared himself to be a supporter of Zionism and refused to prohibit Jewish migration to Palestine. Against that, Churchill did make some disparaging remarks about Indians, though essentially directed at Gandhi and the Indian National Congress party and secessionists generally. However, Churchill was driven in this antipathy by imperialism, not by racism. He was angered in autumn 1930 by the Labour government's decision to grant Dominion status to India. He argued that it would hasten calls for full independence from the British Empire. He joined the Indian Empire Society which opposed the granting of Dominion status. In his view, India was not ready for home rule because he believed that the Hindu Brahmin caste would gain control and further oppress both the \\"untouchables\\" and the religious minorities. In March 1931, when riots broke out in Cawnpore between Hindus and Muslims, he claimed that the situation proved his case. Other political views=European unity Churchill was an early proponent of pan-Europeanism, having written an article in 1930 calling for a \\"United States of Europe\\", although it included the qualification that Britain must be \\"with Europe but not of it\\". After the Second World War, he eagerly sought the creation of the Council of Europe to be centred round a Franco- German partnership, with Britain and the US as \\"friends and sponsors of the new Europe\\". He supported the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1950 but again emphasised that Britain must not actually join any federal grouping. In November 1951, he called for a \\"United Europe\\" in a Cabinet paper but under the proviso that \\"(it is) only when plans for uniting Europe take a federal form that we cannot take part, because we cannot subordinate ourselves or the control of British policy to federal authorities\\". Ireland Churchill always opposed partition of Ireland. As a minister in 1913 and again in 1921, he suggested that Ulster have some autonomy from an independent Irish government, but was always opposed by Ulster Unionists. As Leader of the Opposition, he told John W. Dulanty and Frederick Boland, successive Irish ambassadors to London, that he still hoped for a united Ireland.

To varying degrees, the people in this corridor are essentially a mixture of similar BantuPhilippson G, Montlahuc M-L. Kilimanjaro Bantu. In: Nurse D, Philippson G, editors. The Bantu languages. London: Routledge; 2003. pp. 470–500. (vandu, as the people), Nilotic (Maa speakers) and Cushitic (Muu, as the people) branches of the African people. The groups were dynamic, fluid and flexible. They shared a common history characterised by constant movement between the different areas for trade, battles, migration as well as social reasons. They were categorised arbitrarily by Europeans into the following culturally, linguistically and/or genetically related groups: *Arusha *Meru *Pare *Taveta *Taita *Chagga *Mbugu  Colonial  As it occurred throughout East Africa Ole Bjørn Rekdal.

PhD Thesis, the people in this corridor have been poorly characterised by early European visitors, resulting in incorrect categorisation of ethnicity, language and groups. The assumption of static tribes is foreign to the region; the indigenous population often better identify with lineages/clans. Although those early classification persists, they are acknowledged as trivial divisions by the indigenous population, as evident in the shared history and occurrence of the same lineages/clans amongst the different groups.  Ancestry  Based on the dominating languages and customs (e.g. initiation, circumcision); the area is predominantly of Bantu ancestry. Genetic studies confirm this Bantu ancestry, but show notable differences to the adjacent Mijikenda bantu-speaking people reflecting their distinct cultural historiesMitochondrial DNA diversity in two ethnic groups in southeastern Kenya: perspectives from the northeastern periphery of the Bantu expansion.

Evidence of the Cushitic ancestry is in the influence of extinct Cushitic languages on the Bantu languages that either replaced them (e.g. Taita Cushitic) or resulted in a mixed language (i.e. Mbugu language)Maarten Mous, Leiden University. The Making of a Mixed Language: The case of Ma’a/Mbugu. 2003. John Benjamins Publishing Company. https://doi.org/10.1075/cll.26. Most of the Cushitic groups were assimilated/co-mingled/absorbed, but remnants of those lineages remain amongst the Mbugu people. The Nilotic influence can be attributed to groups such as the Ngasa that introduced practices of female circumcision in this population. With the Maasai settled in the open plains around much of the area, inevitably a part of the population adopted and assimilated into the Maasai culture to form groups such as the Arusha. This interaction has also resulted in a number of Nilotic lineages in this population, often holding prominent roles due to their warrior status; as evidenced in the names, practices and oral history. A further insight into this mixed ancestry is in the traditions and distinct phenotypes observed within members of this population. This has also been established genetically, where gene flow of non-bantu speakers were shown to be partially incorporated into what are now Taita.

Perkins: The Army Operating Concept DARPA AlphaDogfight Trials (ADTs), 20 August 2020 Definition According to the US Army the definition of overmatch is \\"the concept where my (insert lethality system here) can willfully and without prejudice or luck defeat your (insert your protective system here).\\" According to Raytheon overmatch is a verb which means \\"to defeat threats at every level – strategic, tactical and technological.\\" Example — AI versus human pilots AI agents are not subject to the physiological constraints of a human pilot, such as the danger of flying at low altitude, or the g-forces of the aircraft accelerations. Human pilots noted that the AI agents flew with fine motor control. In the 2020 AlphaDogfight Trials (see image to the right), the AI agents battled for the chance to dogfight an expert human pilot. The winning AI agent consistently defeated an expert human pilot.

Approximately 1,500-2,000 of his poems and numerous prose works survive. Korea doesn't develop the hangul writing system until the 15th century; these earlier works were written using hanmun characters. The 13th century Collected Works of Minister Yi of Korea by Yi Kyubo is one of the earliest texts of a Korean writer commissioned by an official patron. Background Medieval Korean poetry was influenced by Chinese culture. In 1190 Yi Kyubo passed a State Civil Examination that the Koryo dynasty modeled on the Confucian traditions of the Tang Dynasty. He became the first privy counselor of the ruling Ch'oe family. Yi Kyubo fled to Kanghwa island during the Mongol invasions of Korea. As Korean peasants were left to the slaughter, Yi Kyubo composed poems describing their plight. Yi Kyubo was one of the most important literary critics of his time, concerned with form theory (yongsa ron) and creative theory (shunui ron). His views diverged from those of Yi Illo, who rejected the notion of the importance of individual creativity in poetry. Although both held similar views, Yi Illo was more conservative and placed a greater emphasis on classical Chinese forms. value the use of an elegant or refined language. Influence of Chinese poets Modern Korean scholars have attributed Chinese influence in Yi Kyubo's writing to Bai Juyi (白居易), Tao Yuanming (陶淵明) and Su Dongpo (蘇東坡). Bai Juyi was one of the most influential Tang dynasty writers, even more influential than Li Bai and Du Fu. Although the Middle Tang era was four centuries before Yi Kyubo's time, imitation of Middle Tang literature continued to be commonplace in the Song Dynasty. Koryo envoys had acquired copies of two of the four major encyclopedic works compiled during the reign of the Song emperor Taizong, one of which was the Wenyuan yinghua (Finest Blossoms in the Garden of Literature). This work had intended to teach Song era writers how to compose poetry ad other literary works. He wrote a poem about Tao Yuanming called Reading Tao Yuanming's Poems\\": > Tao Yuanming freed himself from official business: he returned to the > country, to wander among pine, bamboo and chrysanthemum. When he had no > wine, he sought out a fried; he fell down drunk every day. On the sleeping > bench he stretched his body out; the breeze blew cool and refreshing. From > the bright ancient world he came, a scholar noble and true. I think of the > man when I read the poems; his integrity will be praised for a thousand > years. Yi Kyubo's works were heavily influenced by Su Dongpo, considered the greatest poet of the Northern Song of whom he wrote: \\"Dongpo was the greatest man of letters, towering over all others in modern times.\\" Works Yi Kyubo wrote prose works in the kajon genre, \\"fictitious\\" biographies first popularized by Han Yu in the Tang dynasty. Along his works in this genre are the Tale of the Turtle in Clear Water and The Story of Mr. Yeast. The Lay of King Tongmyong may be Yi Kyubo's best known poem. The mythic tale of the founding of the Kingdom of Koguryo emphasized local Korean historical legends and cultural achievements. It is considered a nationalist rebuttal to Chinese-dominated historical traditions and Mongol political dominance.

ANA itself was sold to Ansett in October 1957, which was liquidated in 2002. New England Airways Airlines of Australia was originally incorporated as the New England Airways (NEAL) on 1 January 1931, with George A. Robinson as managing director and his future son-in-law, Keith Virtue (1909–1980) as director and chief pilot. Taking over the QANTAS Brisbane–Lismore route, the company first used a four-passenger Mahoney-Ryan B-1 (VH-UIZ) and three-passenger de Havilland Puss Moth (VH-UPM). Further aircraft were purchased, and more routes acquired and extended. Airlines of Australia Limited In October 1935 the new company of Airlines of Australia Limited was floated to replace and incorporate New England Airways. It commenced operations in January 1936. The new company also acquired the rights to manufacturing Sikorsky flying boats. Australian National Airways (ANA) gained a controlling interest in Airlines of Australia in April 1937, although the two airlines and assets retained separate public identities until 1 July 1942. Their two surviving Stinsons were then renamed VH-UKK Binana and VH-UYY Tokana. Airlines of Australia also held shares in ANA. By 1954, the company was showing a financial loss. The airline colour was red. Aircraft Airlines of Australia owned over twenty aircraft, including: * VH-UGG Lismore, Stinson Model A tri-motor monoplane, brought from the US to Australia by June 1936, crashing in March 1937 at Archerfield, Brisbane, Queensland. Crash, killing one pilot and one passenger, involved the right engine. * VH-UHH Brisbane, Stinson Model A tri-motor monoplane, brought from the US to Australia by June 1936, crashing in February 1937 in the McPherson Ranges, south of Brisbane, Queensland. Crash, killing two pilots and three passengers, attributed to wind down-draft in bad weather. * VH-UKK Townsville, Stinson Model A tri-motor monoplane, brought from the US to Australia by June 1936, was still in existence by March 1945. It was inspected as part of a coronial inquiry investigating the crash of now-Australian National Airways' Stinson A2.W aircraft, VH-UYY Grafton, a fatal crash at Redesdale, Victoria on 31 January 1945, that may have been attributed to a crack in the tail fitting. VH-UKK had developed cracks on two previous occasions.

The fighting was closely connected to the Second Liberian Civil War and the Sierra Leone Civil War and primarily occurred on Guinea's borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone. Beginning in September 2000, some of the most intense fighting took place around the city of Guéckédou in December, before the level of violence decreased in 2001.  Background  Guinea's support for LURD rebels (pictured) lead to tense relations with Liberia In 1999, Guinea had 450,000 refugees from the First Liberian Civil War and the Sierra Leone Civil War, the highest number in Africa at the time. Most of these refugees lived near the borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia. While this border region was initially peaceful, in the late 1990s the Sierra Leonean rebel group RUF began to conduct cross border raids into Guinea. The start of the Second Liberian Civil War in 1999 lead to an influx of more refugees and cross border raids from Liberian forces. During the First Liberian Civil War, Guinea had supported the government of Samuel Doe, and had sent troops as part of an ECOMOG force, which clashed with the forces of the rebel leader Charles Taylor. When Taylor became the president of Liberia, Guinea supported the LURD rebel group, which it allowed to launch attacks on Liberia from Guinea. Thus, relations between the two countries were tense. Guinea experienced two failed coup attempts in 1996 and 1998. With Liberian and RUF support and alleged weapons deliveries from Burkina Faso, Guinean officers who fled the country after the 1996 coup attempt formed the Rassemblement des Forces Démocratiques de Guinée (RFDG) in order to overthrow president Lansana Conté.  Insurgency  A map of Guinea. The fighting primarily took place near the borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone The first attack was on September 2, 2000, at Massadou, on the border with Liberia. At least 40 people, including civilians, were killed. On September 4, Madina Woula, on the border with Sierra Leone, was attacked, causing the deaths of at least 40 people. On September 6, the RUF was allegedly involved in the temporary capture of Pamelap, the closest attack at the time to the capital, Conakry. In response to the attacks, on September 9, president Lansana Conté gave a speech in which he said that there were rebels among the refugees and that the refugees should go home. In addition to the Guinean Army, LURD forces were mobilized to defend Macenta and Guéckédou. Young Guineans from the border areas were recruited into local militias called Young Volunteers. On September 17, Macenta was attacked, and the head of the UNHCR office in the town was killed, along with other civilians. Macenta and Forécariah were attacked multiple times in September. In October and November the fighting was primarily in the Languette region, an area near Guéckédou that borders both Sierra Leone and Liberia. At the start of the insurgency it was mostly unknown who was causing the attacks, but in mid-October the RFDG claimed responsibility. While there were also reports of rebels called the Union des Forces pour une Guinée Nouvelle (UFGN) and Union de Forces Démocratique de Guinée (UFDG), these were mostly like part of the RFDG. On November 30, the rebels took control of towns near the city of Kissidougou which they managed to hold for about a week. Fighting also took place in the refugee camps around Kissidougou. On December 6, RUF fighters attacked Guéckédou from the south and east while RFDG and Liberian troops attacked from the west. The fighting in the town lasted for weeks and displaced 100,000 people. On March 9, 2001, rebels attacked the Nongoa area in the last significant attack in the insurgency, although isolated fighting was reported until 2002.  Aftermath  The fighting greatly affected Guinea's large refugee population. Refugees were harassed, attacked, forcibly recruited, and displaced by the fighting. In addition, after the killing of the head of the UNHCR office in Macenta, UNHCR activities outside Conakry were suspended for months, leaving refugees without assistance. The fighting also displaced many Guineans. However, the insurgency did not manage to turn into a civil war that would have caused much more damage. In February 2002, a meeting between the presidents of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in Rabat lead to a commitment to security along the countries' borders and to repatriate refugees.

Relations between Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe independence movement started before the 1980 independence and were marked by participation of both sides in activities of the Non-Aligned Movement. History Both the Zimbabwe African National Union led by Robert Mugabe and the Zimbabwe African People's Union led by Joshua Nkomo participated as observers in the 1978 Non-Aligned Movement Ministerial Conference in Belgrade. Mugabe's movement was perceived as more China aligned and supported while Nkomo's movement was perceived as a pro-Soviet movement. Cold War Yugoslavia, marked by experience of the 1948 Tito–Stalin split, showed more sympathies towards the Mugabe's movement to which it provided certain military assistance in ts fight against racist regime of unrecognized Rhodesia. Yugoslavia showed its preferences on protocol level by assigning Mugabe's movement delegation number 110. while Nkomo's movement ended as 111. delegation. Yugoslav diplomacy pushed for quick conclusion of the Lancaster House Agreement which directly led to the creation and recognition of the Republic of Zimbabwe. British Conservative politician and minister in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Peter Blaker visited Belgrade in November 1979 where in conversation with Josip Vrhovec he stated belief that agreement will be reached soon, while Yugoslavia expressed concerns over foreign intrusion in Zambia. Relations from 1980 until the Breakup of Yugoslavia One of the first large international outings for Robert Mugabe after the independence happened at during the state funeral of Josip Broz Tito in May 1980. Mugabe, who was inspired by Yugoslav model, stated that Yugoslav support to Zimbabwe's revolution is large and will never be forgotten, and that World War II Yugoslav Partisans resistance against Fascism was inspiration in Zimbabwe. Cvijetin Mijatović visited Zimbabwe in spring of 1981 during his African tour while Mugabe returned this visit in November of the same year.

History proves that there had been significant phases of Migration to Asssam (Ancient Kamarupa or Pragjyotishpur) during the ancient period.Many historians claim that after the Austric group migrated to ancient Assam, the next group of people who arrived in Assam is the Dravidian group who are represented by Bania and Kaibbartas today in Assam.Cambridge History of India ( Page, 49-50)Chandra Bhusan's : Assam, Its Heritage and CultureEarly History of Kamrupa----Rai KL Barua Bahadur(1933)(page-16,17,18,19) Unlike the mainland Baniya community, this community of Assam is recognized as Schedule Caste by Govt. of India.http://socialjustice.nic.in/writereaddata/UploadFile/Scan-0002.jpghttps://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_sc_assam.pdf Origin Chand Sadagar, (Assamese:চান্দ সদাগৰ) who was a Merchant ( Bania in Assamese ) is believed to be the ancient descendant of the ethnic Bania community of Assam. He was a rich and powerful river and sea merchant of Champak Nagar, Kamarupa who lived between 200-300 AD. Narayan Dev gave an account in his Manasamangal about the merchant ship of the trader Chand Saudagar proceeding to the sea from ancient Champaknagar of Assam passing through Saptagram and Tribeni, the tri-junction of the Ganges, Saraswati and Jamuna River. In the Padmapuran ( Hindu Scriptures), account of Chand Bania ( Sadagar) is specifically mentioned. Narayan Dev also have mentioned in Padmapuran about the father of Behula who was called as Sahe Bania. Sahe Bania established his kingdom at Udalguri/Tangla area of the old Kamarupa.Further, it has been established in the history book \\" Mangaldai Buranji \\" by the historian Dineswar Sarma that Chand Sadagar belonged to ancient Bania community whose predecessors are represented by the Assamese Bania community today. These people later got scattered all over Brahmaputra valley . However, people with direct lineage of Chand Sadagar are still there in Udalguri and Tangla district of Assam. The ruins and statue of Chand Sadagar are found in Chhaygaon Area of Assam.It is proved genuine by the Archaeological Department of India.Moreover, Champak Nagar is still found in Chaigaon of Kamarupa.  Medieval history  During the Medieval Period, most of the people from Bania community accepted Vaishnavism under the patronage of Srimanta Sankardeva. Hari Das Baniya, a prominent Vaishnav Saint during the 14th century, was a devotee and a very close disciple of Srimanta Sankardeva. Hari Das Bania Ata later took Patronage at the Barpeta Satra although he originally belong to Nagaon. He played a significant role in the Vaishnav Moment led by Srimanta Samkardeva. The famous historian of the Ahom King Purandar Singha, Swarnakar Dutiram Hazarika was from this community. One of his well known history book is 'Kali Bharat Buranji'. It is the one and only history book written in the form of poetry in Assam. He also wrote several other important books in the 18th century like Rasik Puran (about the evil effect of Opium Drug in the Assamese society) and Baniya Xokol Axomoloi Oha Vrittanto (an account of the Advent of Baniyas to Assam). The Baniyas of Assam were offered good ranks in the Ahom Administration/Army : Pani Phukan, Hazarika, Boruah, Borah, Mudoi etc. The Bania people like the Kaibbartas were considered as lower class by the Kayastha & Brahmin community of Assam in the older times. Even, this system is still in practice in some of the places in Assam. Like, the Kaibbarta community, the Baniya community of upper Assam also joined the Moamoria Rebellion (1769–1805) as they were followers of Aniruddha Deva. They took patronage under the Satras that followed the Kala Sanghati (Mayamara Cult which allowed people from all castes and tribes equal status and opportunities in preaching and practicing the Vaishnav Dharma) like Dihing Satra, Mayamara Satra etc.  Post-Colonisation era  During the late 1980s Sjt. Sonadhar Senapati who was a well educated Assamese man and was working in a good position at the Assam Secretariat at Shillong represented the problems of the oppressed castes and tribes of Assam in front of the British. During the meeting he met Mr. Mahi Miri who represented the Mising Tribe in the meeting. Sonadhar Senapati was impressed with the Charming personality of Mr. Mahi Miri. Sonadhar Senapati breaking all the stereotypes of the society during that time arranger his daughter's (Indira Senapati's) marriage with Mr. Mahi Miri who later became the Chief Conservator of Kaziranga National Park. It was under the leadership of Sonadhar Senpati, that these indigenous community from the Brahmaputra Valley was inserted in the Schedule Caste category by the Govt. of India. Indira Senapti alias Indira Miri is also one of the famous personality of the Assamese Bania community. Indira Miri who did her masters at University of Edinburgh, UK during that time was appointed as the Chief Education Officer of NEFA with her base at Sadiya, a small Assamese town and worked among the tribals for ten years. During the earthquake of 1950, Miri and her fellow teachers were known to have worked for bringing relief to the people of the region.

He is known for his work on the survival of Leptospira spp in the environment, research on conditions and media for Leptospira growth, his role in the initial discoveries of leptospirosis in New Zealand, for early epidemiologic descriptions of leptospirosis as an occupational disease of dairy farmers, and for the major pathogenic Leptospira species, Leptospira kirschneri, that was named in his honor.  Early life and education  Kirschner was born in Andrichau, near Bielitz, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, (present-day Andrychów, Poland) to Jewish parents. He studied medicine in Vienna. Kirschner's studies were interrupted by service in the medical corps during World War One. Following the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Kirschner followed Professor Robert Doerr, an experimental pathologist, to Amsterdam for further studies at the Koninklijk Instituut voor de Tropen (KIT), the Dutch Royal Tropical Institute. KIT housed the first leptospirosis reference laboratory in Europe.  Career and research = Pasteur Institute, Bandung, Dutch East Indies  In 1921 Kirschner joined the Pasteur Institute at Bandung, Java, in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) where he served as Deputy Director of the Institute under Louis Otten. The Institute was responsible for preparing vaccines and carrying out diagnostic services for 70 million people. While there, Kirschner undertook important work on the survival in the environment of the bacteria that causes leptospirosis, and he and a colleague developed an effective vaccine against plague, testing early versions on themselves. Kirschner’s work in Java was cut short by the Japanese invasion in 1942. He and wife Alice, a gifted violinist from Vienna, survived and provided considerable covert assistance to other prisoners using his scientific knowledge.  University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand  Kirschner was recruited to the University of Otago Medical School by Dr – later Sir – Charles Hercus in 1946, to the Medical Research Council Microbiology Unit. At the time of his arrival, New Zealand was considered to be free of leptospirosis, an assumption based in part on the absence of native terrestrial mammalian hosts. However, Kirschner noted that many mammalian species that could serve as hosts of Leptospira spp had been introduced to New Zealand, and that measures at ports to prevent rats being imported on ships were weak. Kirschner hypothesized that leptospirosis was very likely to be present and responsible for febrile illness among farmers in New Zealand. He established a leptospirosis reference laboratory at the University of Otago Medical School, confirming with Dr – later Sir – Edward G. Sayers, future Dean of the Otago Medical School, human leptospirosis in New Zealand for the first time in a sharemilker from Auckland in 1949. Then with Mr – later Professor – A. Neil Bruère the first livestock and occupational disease outbreak among dairy farm workers in Westland in 1951. Kirschner promoted close collaboration between human and animal health experts, known today as the ‘One Health’ approach. Kirschner and colleagues went on to describe the major leptospirosis problem among dairy farmers in New Zealand; studied factors supporting and inhibiting Leptospira growth; and procedures for the culture, isolation, and identification Leptospira. Kirschner was an important early influence on the career of a generation of leptospirosis experts, including Professor Solomon Faine, Monash University, and Professor Roger Marshall, Massey University. Kirschner died in Dunedin on 23 November 1970 and is buried with wife Alice Kirschner at the Dunedin Southern Cemetery.  Honors and recognition  In 1992 Marshall and colleagues named the major pathogenic Leptospira species Leptospira kirschneri for Kirschner.

Early life and education  Born in Zemun, Syrmia, Austrian Empire, Moser was the son of a winegrower and smoker from Upper Austria. As a child he received violin lessons and sang in the church choir. His high school singing teacher was Friedrich Hegar. From 1874, Moser attended the Zurich Kantonsschule. After graduating from high school, he first studied engineering at the Technical University of Zurich and architecture in Stuttgart. In addition to his studies, he gained further musical experience, among other things as first violinist of the \\"Zurich Student Quartet\\" and conductor of the Stuttgart Academic Singing Association. He finally turned his attention to music for good and in 1878 became a student of Joseph Joachim at the Berlin University of the Arts. The following year, Moser took up a post as assistant teacher there.  Career  In 1883 he received his first position as concertmaster at the Nationaltheater Mannheim, but had to give it up after a few months for health reasons. He worked first as a private violin teacher and from 1888 as a lecturer at the Berlin Musikhochschule. In 1900 he was appointed full professor for violin there. Among his students were Pálma von Pászthory, Josef Wolfsthal, Robert Imandt, Richard Czerwonky, Hans Bassermann and Julius Ruthström. In 1925, the philosophical faculty of the University of Berlin awarded him an honorary doctorate.Andreas Moser In Arnold Ebel (ed.): Berliner Musikjahrbuch. Verlagsanstalt Deutsche Tonkünstler AG, Berlin 1926. Moser played as violist in the Joachim Quartet and led his own string quartet in the 1890s, which performed in Berlin. However, he suffered from a \\"nervous complaint of the arm\\" (E. van der Straeten), which prevented him from performing regularly, so he concentrated on teaching. In Berlin he became Joachim's most important assistant and wrote music-theoretical publications with him, especially the three-volume Violin School of 1905. He also published a biography of Joachim, edited a collection of letters between Brahms and Joachim and, after Joachim's death, published Methodik des Violinspiels (Leipzig, 1920) and Technik des Violinspiels (Leipzig, 1925) and was active as editor of violin literature with Edition Peters and the Universal Edition.Andreas Moser In: Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart MGG vol. 9, . Bärenreiter-Verlag 1986  Personal life  From 1888, Moser was married to Edda (1868-1930), daughter of the writer Rudolf Elcho. The marriage produced a son, the musicologist Hans Joachim Moser.

The Yarenskian Gorizont (\\"Yarenskian Horizon\\") is a major biostratigraphic unit in Russia corresponding to Upper Olenekian-age terrestrial sediments. It lies above the Ustmylian Gorizont of the Vetlugian Supergorizont, and is located below a short unconformity overlain by the Donguz Gorizont. Some paleontologists elevate the Yarenskian to a supergorizont and subdivide it into two smaller units: the older Fedorovskian Gorizont and the younger Gamskian Gorizont. Others prefer to consider the Fedorovskian and Gamskian to be subgorizonts or members of the Yarenskian. Vertebrate index fossils of the Fedorovskian include the lungfish Gnathorhiza, the trematosaurid Inflectosaurus, and the procolophonid Burtensia. In the Gamskian, these index fossils are replaced by Ceratodus, Trematosaurus, and Kapes, respectively. The Yarenskian as a whole is characterized by the capitosaur amphibian Parotosuchus, and has also been known as the Parotosuchus fauna. A few geographical influence on the faunas can be observed; erythrosuchids and rhytidosteids are more common in southern exposures while procolophonids and putative \\"rauisuchids\\" are more common in the north. The Yarenskian encompasses several svitas (equivalent to geological formations). The most fossiliferous and best-exposed is the Petropavlovskaya Svita, a Fedorovskian-age assemblage in the Cis-Ural region (near the Ural River in Orenburg Oblast). Another productive unit is the Gamskian-age Lipovskaya Formation, which is found near the Don River in Volgograd Oblast. The Caspian Depression includes coastal sediments equivalent to the Yarenskian (such as the Bogdo or Bogdinskaya Svita), though there is some controversy over how the stratigraphy of the area should be defined. Thin exposures of Yarenskian units are also known further north in the Vyatka, Vychegda, Luza, and Pechora basins.

On 2 November 1813 Lady Mary Pelham, acting commander Perring (or Pering), and , John A. Norway, master, encountered the American privateer Globe, Captain Richard Moon, off Teneriffe. During the engagement, Captain Norway, the surgeon, and two seamen were killed on Montague; 11 seamen were wounded. Lady Mary Pelham had two men wounded, one of them being Perring. There were conflicting accounts of the engagement, one denigrating Perring as a lawyer whose sole experience had been sailing a yacht, and Lady Mary Pelhams contribution to the engagement being too little too late. The matter came up in Parliament where documents were table showing that a second court of inquiry had exonerated Captain Perring and acknowledged that Lady Mary Pelham{'}s intervention had saved Montague from capture and had eventually succeeded in driving Globe off. After the engagement Globe put into Grand Canary in a highly damaged state. She had had 33 men killed, 19 wounded, and five captured in attempts to board Montague. Captain James Graham assumed command of Lady Mary Pelham on 21 June 1814. Capture Captain Graham sailed from Falmouth on 20 November 1814 and arrived at Suriname in January 1815. Lady Mary Pelham sailed from Suriname to Barbados, and then to Antigua, leaving Antigua on 1 February.

Kemp had one man killed and three wounded in the 40 minute action. Kemp was armed with six guns and had a crew of 135 men; Lady Mary Pelham was armed with 10 guns and had a complement of 42 men, including five passengers. Almeida sold his crew $632.75 worth of clothes taken from Lady Mary Pelham. The sum then became part of the prize account. Kemp sent her into Wilmington, North Carolina where she was libeled on 31 March 1815 and condemned. American merchantman Lady Mary Pelham was sold in Wilmington, with new owners retaining the name.

History The institute was founded in 1822 by Carl Friedrich Zelter and served to train organists, cantors and teachers at seminars and grammar schools. In the early years, the training usually only lasted one year, but could be extended to two years if necessary. The first teachers at the facility, which was popularly called the Organ Institute (Orgel-Institut), were August Wilhelm Bach (organ) and Bernhard Klein (vocals and instrumentation). Carl Gottlieb Reissiger followed in 1825, followed soon after by Eduard Grell. Directors after Zelter's death were: * August Wilhelm Bach, 1832–1869, * August Haupt, 1869–1891, * Robert Radecke, 1892–1907, * Hermann Kretzschmar, 1907–1922, * Carl Thiel, 1922–1927, * Hans Joachim Moser, 1927–1933. * Fritz Stein, 1933–1934. * Eugen Bieder, 1934–1945. The institute was initially located in Zelter's apartment in the Singakademie building on the Fortress Moat. In 1832, the company moved to Papenstraße 10 to the official apartment of August Wilhelm Bach, which was located in the immediate vicinity of St. Mary's Church, where Bach worked as music director and organist.

Björkstén was the first coach in the Nordic countries to separate from the usual military gymnastics. She also served as the inaugural president of the Scandinavian Association for Women Gymnastics, however disliked competitive sports. Early life Björkstén was born in 1870 in Lappeenrantathe as the only girl to parents Johan Isak Björkstén and Elise Ollongren. As a child, her family moved to Forssa when the father got a provincial medical service in Tammela, and she grew up alongside Christian Sibelius. Björkstén trained as a gymnastics coach in Elin Asp's Institute in Helsinki and took a sabbatical to learn German gymnastics. Coaching career While working as the head teacher for women's gymnastics at the University of Helsinki, Björkstén began to question the legitimacy of the Pehr Henrik Ling method of gymnastics. She found the traditional, military-style gymnastics too stiff and formal when it should be, in her opinion, stimulating experience in everyday life. As a result, Björkstén developed a newer form of gymnastics which focused on freedom, energy, liveliness, and rhythm in movements. She was appointed the head coach of the Finnish gymnastics team at the 1912 Summer Olympics and her method became widespread across Europe. Prior to her influence, there had been no distinction between male and female gymnasts. Although she coached the Olympic team, Björkstén disliked competitive sports and medal for she questioned the health benefits of hard training. Following the Olympic Games, Björkstén became the first chair of the Swedish Federation of Physical Education for Women in Finland and the first lecturer in educational gymnastics at the Institute of Physical Education. She also served as the inaugural president of the Scandinavian Association for Women Gymnastics and held courses in Scandinavian countries every year. As a result of her gymnastics theory, she was invited to become Honorary member of The Ling Association and received official recognition in Scandinavia, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland.

The film is noted for its on-screen performances of old-time music commonly associated with Appalachia. Plot During the Great Depression, Vestal Abner, his wife Oza and their young son Charlie reluctantly move from their impoverished farm in Eastern Kentucky to Ohio, where Vestal has found a job. As Charlie grows up and eventually marries his childhood friend, Ruthie, he yearns to return to his boyhood home in the mountains, never losing his passion for the traditional mountain music of his ancestors.

Farmer, an old-time musician himself, loosely based the movie on the story of his grandparents, who migrated as children to Ohio from Jackson County, Kentucky during the 1930s. The title of the film refers to a musical style often used in traditional Appalachian music in which the third note is raised, not lowered as in a traditional minor key. Production The Mountain Minor was a collaboration of Alt452 Productions, WonderlandWoods.tv and From the Heart Productions. The film spans several decades as it follows the characters Charlie Abner and Ruth Whit from childhood into adulthood, marriage and retirement. Though many scenes are set in Kentucky, they were filmed primarily at the historic Willet Ponds Farm in Todd, North Carolina for logistical and budget reasons. Other scenes were filmed in Newport, Kentucky; Oxford, Ohio; and Eaton, Ohio. Because of the film's emphasis on old-time music and Farmer's desire for authenticity, he decided to cast most of the main roles with experienced musicians, including Smithsonian Folkways recording artist Elizabeth LaPrelle (of the duo Anna & Elizabeth), Dan Gellert, Ma Crow and Mike Oberst of the band The Tillers. As Farmer told Bluegrass Today, “I figured that if I took professional musicians who are used to performing, that musicians would make better actors than actors make musicians.” Release and Critical Response The Mountain Minor premiered at the Jukebox International Film Festival in Carson City, Nevada in 2018, where it received awards for Best of Festival and Best Picture-Runner Up. The film subsequently received awards in other festivals. In addition to film festival awards, The Mountain Minor received positive reviews in several publications. Bill McGoun of the Asheville Citizen-Times called it \\"a powerful and true-to-life depiction of people doing what they needed to do to make their way in a sometimes difficult world\\". James Peterson for the Old-Time Central described the film as \\"highly entertaining, packed with beautiful scenery, and full of great tunes played masterfully by the actors themselves\\". Joel Wertman, president of The Heartland Network, said, \\"This film captures beautifully how the country music genre was born\\". Following screenings at film festivals, The Mountain Minor had its commercial theatrical premiere at The Esquire Theatre in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 17 and October 20, 2019. Additional theatrical showings took place in other cities from November, 2019 until March, 2020. Subsequent theatrical showings were canceled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic causing most movie theaters and other entertainment venues to shut down beginning in March, 2020. With theaters closed, Alt452 Productions released The Mountain Minor on Blu-ray, DVD, Amazon and Vimeo on Demand in the spring of 2020. Several television entities also began showing, or making plans to show the film, including The Heartland Network, Kentucky Educational Television (KET) and West Virginia Public Broadcasting. A soundtrack album, The Mountain Minor Motion Picture Soundtrack, was released on October 16, 2020.

The wood features one of north-west Ireland's best and largest semi-natural deciduous woodlands. It contains old sessile oak woods, with holly and hazel trees. Other habitats include scrub, wet grassland, wet woodland, and wet heath. It is also a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive, listed in Annex I of the Directive. As part of the management of the wood, grazing livestock have been removed from the area, allowing a natural regeneration of the trees such as rowan and oak. During the winter months, small horses are grazed there in keeping with local tradition to eat rushes, grasses and sedges to open up ground for tree saplings to grow. The hazel trees are coppiced, and non-native trees are being removed from the site. Badgers, stoats, and foxes are known to inhabit the wood, and occasional visitors include deer. Buzzards and ravens nest in the wood, and many native Irish woodland birds also inhabit the area.

Early life and education  Suleiman's parents are from Mogadishu, in Somalia. Her mother was an anaesthesiologist and her father worked for the port authority. Suleiman's mother worked as a physician throughout the civil unrest in Mogadishu. They immigrated to Canada during the Somali Civil War, taking their three children (including Suleiman) and her teenage cousin with them. Suleiman has said that she was inspired to become a physician because of her mother. Her family relocated to Hamilton, Ontario, where her mother's medical degree was not recognised and her parents were forced to do janitorial work. Together they helped to settle refugees who had arrived in Canada. For her undergraduate studies, Suleiman studied neurobiology and physiology at the University of Maryland, College Park. She completed her medical training at Howard University College of Medicine, where she saw pictures of LaSalle D. Leffall Jr. on the walls. These experiences focussed her aspirations on becoming an orthopaedic surgeon. In 2009 Suleiman was made an Orthopaedic medical intern as part of the Nth Dimensions programme. Nth Dimensions supports women and minorities who want to become orthopaedic surgeons. She completed a rotation at the Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, where she was mentored by Erik King, Lurie Children's' first African-American orthopaedic surgeon. When she graduated from the orthopaedic programme at Northwestern Memorial Hospital she was the first African-American woman to do so.  Research and career  In 2018 Suleiman joined the faculty at the Feinberg School of Medicine, where she was the first African-American woman orthopaedic surgeon.

He was a member of the Grand Council of Ticino from 2007 to 2015 and the National Council from 2015 to 2019. He has been a member of the Council of States since 2019. Since 2020, he has been the President of the Swiss People's Party. Biography Chiesa was born in Lugano in 1974. His father was a street maintenance worker and he grew up in the Molino Nuovo section of the city. He graduated from the University of Fribourg with a degree in business administration. After college, he worked as a tax advisor and banking expert. However, his career shifted when he became the manager of a retirement home in the Italian region of Grisons. He entered politics as a member of the municipal council of Villa Luganese. In 2007, he was elected to the Grand Council of Ticino. He won a seat in the National Council in 2015 and served one term. In the 2019, he finished second in the first round of voting behind incumbent Filippo Lombardi. With no candidates taking an absolute majority in the first round, the election went to a second round where Chiesa and Marina Carobbio Guscetti surprised with a win over, Lombardi and Giovanni Merlini. Chiesa became the first member of the SVP to represent Ticino in the Council of States and, with the defeat of Merlini, was the first time in more than a century that FDP.The Liberals and its predecessor, the FDP, did not elect one of its members from Ticino. Chiesa was elected to his party's vice presidency in 2018. In 2019, he was mentioned as a possible successor to outgoing SVP president Albert Rösti; however, he initially rejected the overtures as his management of the retirement home did not allow him to take on another position. He later resigned from the center, which opened up the possibility of his nomination. In July 2020, a selection committee of the SVP tasked with nominating a new party president named Chiesa as its preferred candidate for the post. Andreas Glarner withdrew in favor of Chiesa. Before the election, Alfred Heer also withdrew. Chiesa was formally elected as the party president on 22 August 2020. Chiesa has been described as being very close to former SVP power broker Christoph Blocher. He has supported changes to Switzerland's bilateral treaties with the European Union with regard to immigration. He has criticized uncontrolled immigration as being responsible for traffic jams, higher housing costs and unfair competition for workers. He speaks Italian and French fluently and can speak German well.

In the TSS process, temperatures as high as 3000 K are applied for a duration of just seconds or milliseconds, followed by rapid cooling (a TSS image shown in Fig. 1). In this regard, TSS is distinct from conventional high-temperature syntheses that feature slow and near-equilibrium heating at limited temperature ranges (e.g., 1500 K for furnace heating) for extended periods of time (typically hours) and generally slow heating and cooling (~10 K/min). TSS utilizes high temperature to drive reactions at extreme and non-equilibrium conditions. Additionally, the use of the ultra-high temperature can dramatically increase reaction rates for rapid material production. As a result of these characteristics, TSS is particularly applicable for the discovery of new reactions and materials and enabling rapid manufacturing.  Realization  The TSS method was invented by Dr. Liangbing Hu and his team at the University of Maryland, College Park. The technology is also patented. The TSS was first realized by Joule heating of carbon materials to a high temperature and rapidly quenched with a short duration, which are controlled by electric power with a high temporal resolution. The essence of TSS is the ability to precisely control the high temperature to ensure rapid “shock” heating. Generally, the temperature, duration, and ramping rate can be independently controlled for specific heating requirements. Since high- temperature heating is ubiquitously used for reactions and materials synthesis, innovative TSS processes have been discovered and demonstrated, including microwave, laser, rapid radiative heating, and discharge flash heating, enabling synthesis of diverse emerging materials, such as single atom and alloyed catalysts, high entropy alloy nanoparticles, nanoscale composites, battery cathodes and anodes, and high-quality graphene, etc.  References  External Links  High-entropy-alloy nanoparticles Category:Industrial processes ","title":"Thermal shock synthesis (TSS)"},{"id":"64788111","text":"Hans Hugo Christian Hartleb (3 May 1910 – ?) was a German opera director.Hans Hartleb on MémOpéra  Life  Born in Kassel, Hartleb first engaged in theatre studies at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and received his doctorate there in 1936.

She is best known for socially engaged conceptual installations that address violence against women and the loss of Indigenous culture. Her works primarily explore themes of personal and cultural trauma, through the lens of a Native American woman. Recent work, employing indigenous matrilineal motifs, asserts female agency and challenges phallocentric hierarchies. Beyond the United States, Hill's art has exhibited internationally in Canada, Russia, Japan, and the United Kingdom.  Early life and education  Hill was born and raised in Atlanta and spent most of her adult life there. In 2006, she moved to Western North Carolina in order to focus on art, deepen her understanding of Cherokee culture and the endangered Cherokee language. Hill completed a Master of Fine Arts degree at Western Carolina University in 2012, and Retracing the Trace was part of her Master's project. In her thesis, Hill explained that each cord contained between one and 3,780 knots, representing the estimated numbers of rapes that go unreported in the United States every day. Elaborating on the use of these knotted and crimson-dyed cords, Hill stated that \\"They aren't being counted by our justice system, but I'm counting them. Each cord, like each woman, is unique.\\" Likewise, her use of the Inka khipu knotting system connected the silencing of sexual assault survivors to the silencing of indigenous cultures. In developing Retracing the Trace, Hill found inspiration in the work of other women artists who, similarly, explored themes of abuse and trauma, including Suzanne Lacy, Ana Mendieta, and Tracey Emin as well as the ideas of Jacques Lacan .  Artistic works  Her first exhibit, In de Soto's Path, happened in 1997 at the Santa Fe Indian Market. Some of Hill's earlier works also drew on Cherokee creation myths to explore linkages between sexuality, fulfillment, pain, and birth, presenting indigenous American art as connected to contemporary and universal, rather than strictly historical, themes. Her most famous work, Retracing the Trace, reflected her own experience as a rape survivor. The installation featured Hill laying in the middle of thousands of red cords tied into quipu knots. After Hill rose from the pile of strewn knots, her silhouette remained on the floor, the outline mirroring the imprint her own body left in the mud and leaves after her own rape. Over the course of ten days, Hill returned to the gallery, rearranging and affixing each knotted cord to a new position on the gallery walls until a new trace, this one of her own creation, encircled the space. Hill uses carmine to dye her works the signature crimson red that features so prominently in many of her works. In addition to being reminiscent of blood, the production of this particular dye by female cochineal insects to deter predators, also resonates with the major themes of Hill's work. Artist and art scholar Tania Abramson saw Hill's art part of a tradition of \\"female artists who were victims of sexual violence as mediums of enduring transformation, agents of shifting kaleidoscopes that dance between shame and resurrection, humiliation and insight, rage and imagination.\\" After receiving a First Peoples Fund Fellowship in 2015, Hill produced a limited edition letterpress artist’s book, Spearfinger, printed solely in Cherokee syllabary. Hill met Cherokee Nation artist Brenda Mallory in 2015 and, two years later, they co- exhibited Connecting Lines at the Portland Art Museum's Center for Contemporary Native Art. In 2019, Hill received the Ucross Fellowship for Native American Visual Artists. Other significant awards include 2016 Native Arts and Cultures Foundation Fellowship in Visual Arts, the 2015 Eiteljorg Museum Fellowship and 2015 First Peoples Fund Fellowship. Hill's work is featured in Susan Powers' book, \\"Cherokee Art: Prehistory to Present\\", Josh McPhee's book, \\"Celebrate People's History!: The Poster Book of Resistance and Revolution\\", and the PBS Documentary, “Native Art NOW!”.

It was formally established in 1919, and in 1933 was divided into the new provinces of Léopoldville and Lusambo. Location Congo-Kasaï was named after the Kasai River, a major left tributary of the Congo River that provides access to the region. By 1910 a factory of the Kasai Company had been established near Misumba, which had about two thousand inhabitants. The company had made successful trial rubber plantations. The company also bought rubber and ivory from the local people, some of whom used it to buy liquor from the Portuguese territory (Angola). Congo-Kasaï had five districts: the urban district of Léopoldville, capital of the colony, and the districts (from west to east) of Bas-Congo, Kwango, Kasaï and Sankuru. The Huileries du Congo Belge company had two zones (or circles) of exploitation in the province based on Brabanta and Leverville, of which Leverville was the most important. History In the early days of the Belgian Congo the colony was divided into 22 vaguely-defined districts. As the colonial system became established the rulers felt the need to assign the ethnic groups to defined territories, where before they had often been mobile. An arrêté royal of 28 July 1914 grouped the districts into the provinces of Congo-Kasaï, Équateur, Orientale Province and Katanga, with the objective of improving responsiveness through decentralization. The consolidation had in fact started in Katanga in 1912 and Orientale in 1913, but Congo-Kasai did not formally become a vice-government until 1919. Each province was made up of several of the existing districts, which were in turn divided into territories. The territories were divided into sectors. A great many chiefdoms were recognized. Several of the smallest might be combined into one sector, while the largest chiefdoms were split across sectors. As diamond mining activity increased, followed by copper, gold and tin mining in different parts of the colony, it became increasingly hard to recruit workers. Often laborers were obtained from the village chiefs through a combination of commissions and sanctions, and were then taken long distances from their homes to the mines. Death rates were high among the laborers due to poor diet, hard work and greater exposure to diseases, while birth rates were lower. The Commission for the Protection of the Natives in the Congo reported on the problems in 1919. The government and businesses both saw the value of keeping the workforce healthy and productive. The Kasai Company was given a concession for plantations to provide more food to their mine workers. The governor of Congo- Kasaï published regulations that detailed the minimum quantity and quality of rations. The original four provinces had considerable autonomy, but in 1933 they were reorganized into six provinces, named after their capitals, and the central government assumed more control. Congo-Kasai was divided into the new provinces of Léopoldville and Lusambo. In 1947 Lusambo was renamed to Kasaï. In 1965 Kasaï was split into Kasaï-Occidental and Kasaï-Oriental.

Richard Baxter disagreed with Owen, and the following year published a reply, called Aphorisms of Justification. Owen and Baxter continued to exchange views on the subject, and both gained followers for their positions. In 1959, the Banner of Truth Trust republished the book (as simply The Death of Death in the Death of Christ) with an introduction by J. I. Packer. In it, Packer stated that nobody has yet \\"refuted Owen's proof that [limited atonement] is part of the uniform biblical presentation of redemption\\". Carl Trueman suggests that this introduction \\"has probably proved more influential in modern evangelical circles than the text it introduces.\\" On the other hand, Tim Cooper argues that Packer's praise is undeserved, and that the book is \\"weak and unconvincing\\".

In 1987, she completed her studies in economics with a diploma thesis on economic statistics in South Tyrol,Diplomarbeit von Julia Unterberger-Zeller (Universität Innsbruck, 1986) in 1992 successfully completing the law studies offered by the Universities of Innsbruck and Padua with a diploma thesis on the implementation of EC law in Italy.Diplomarbeit von Julia Unterberger- Zeller (Universität Innsbruck, 1991) Professionally, she works as a lawyer specializing in family law in South Tyrol. From 1999 to 2008, she was President of the State Advisory Board for Equal Opportunities. In the provincial elections in 2003, Unterberger was able to win a seat in the Landtag and thus also in the regional council on the list of the South Tyrolean People's Party. She narrowly missed re-election in the 2008 provincial elections. After Christian Egartner had to resign from the Landtag according to a judgment of the court of cassation, Unterberger moved up for him and was sworn in again as a member of parliament on 21 July 2010. On 2 March 2011, she was elected President of the Landtag to succeed Dieter Steger. According to the intended rotation principle at mid-term of the legislative period, she was replaced in this office by Mauro Minniti on 18 May, but remained as vice-president. Unterberger used her work in the Presidium of the Landtag to implement a new interpretation of the rules of procedure that the opposition parties had unsuccessfully fought against and which will prevent future obstruction. Before the state elections in 2013, she decided not to run again. In the parliamentary elections in 2018 she was elected into the Italian Senate with 61.1% of the votes in the single constituency of Merano.

He attended a school in Kamionka, and then continued education in Ropczyce, from 1928 in a private school - Miejskie Staroklasyczne Koedukacyjne Gimnazjum in Ropczyce. He debuted with a poem Jesień (Autumn) printed in a school press Przyszłość (Future, issue from 1 September 1928) and a novella Dawne zapusty published in a timely Rola. He continued his education from 1932 at the Władysław Jagiełło Gimnazjum in Dębica, where he edited the school magazine U nas. He graduated from secondary school diploma in 1936. In 1938 he graduated from the State Pedagogium in Krakow. After completing a one-year military service in September 1939, he graduated from the Infantry Cadet School. He fought during the invasion of Poland in the 6th Infantry Division of the Kraków Army. He took part in the battles of Pszczyna and Tomaszów Lubelski. During the occupation, he lived with his sister Bronisława in the Księżomost part of Sędziszów Małopolski, and then from 1941 in Kraków, where he worked at the Social Insurance Institution (Ubezpieczalnia Społeczna). In Krakow, he was active in the underground, teaching high school students in underground classes. In 1945, he began studies at the Faculty of Humanities (Polish studies) of the Jagiellonian University, which he graduated on December 1, 1947. Wilhelm Mach himself considered his literary debut the publication of the poem Tobie dalekiej (To distant you), printed in autumn 1945 in a one-day journal Inaczej (Differently), co-redacted by him. He debuted as a prose writer with the story Rdza (Rust) in 1945 in the pages of the 42nd issue of the weekly Odrodzenie (Rebirth). In the years 1945–1946 he belonged to the literary group \\"Inaczej” (Differently). In the years 1945-1950 he was the secretary of the editorial office of the monthly \\"Twórczość\\" in Krakow, where he published short stories and literary reviews. He continued to publish in Odrodzenie (1945–1947) and Dziennik Literacki (1947–1950). From 1945 he was a member of the Youth Circle at the Krakow branch of the Polish Writers' Union. He became a member of the Union in 1948. In the years 1947–1948 he was on a scholarship from the French government in Paris. In 1950 he moved to Warsaw together with the editorial office of Twórczość. He was a literary consultant for the Polish Army House. In 1950–1958 he was the editor of the weekly Nowa Kultura (New culture), where he became known as a patron of aspiring and beginning writers, reviewing their works and advertising them to the publishers. From 1956 he traveled to the USSR and India, and from 1958 to Bulgaria several times, and in 1961 to the United States. He was friends with Zofia Nałkowska, who appointed him one of the four curators of her legacy. He died suddenly 2 July 1965. According to his biographer Janusz Termer and family, the cause was a heart attack. Literary friends of Mach, such as and Kazimierz Brandys, however, recalled that the writer committed suicide by poisoning himself and that he talked about such plans even earlier. He was buried on Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw (Quarter C 2 row, 6 m. 8).  Private life  The Polish literary circles were widely aware of Mach's homosexuality, but did not speak of it for over 20 years after his death. Nowakowski would later describe how Mach shared the fate of many Polish gay men of the period, having to hide in the closet and live a double life, looking for relationships in shady surroundings such as train stations. In 1976, after a publication of Kalendarz i klepsydra by Tadeusz Konwicki, Mach's sister threatened to sue the author, who called his friend Mach an \\"auntie\\" in the book, for defamation. She didn't file the charges, but the mention of Mach disappeared from the later editions.

He also represented Zambia at the 1989 CECAFA Cup and CAN 1990. Early life Chisala was born in Mufulira where his father Philemon Kapele worked as a miner for Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) Mufulira Division. The fifth born in a family of ten, He grew up in Section 5 of Kantanshi, one of the mining areas in Mufulira. His younger brother Patson Kapele would also go on to play for Wanderers.Chisala: ‘Mighty’ legend turns welder, Zambia Daily Mail, 3 September 2011 He attended Mufulira Mine and Kantanshi Secondary Schools where he played schools football, and joined Mutende Youth team before moving up to play club football. Playing career Chisala joined FAZ Division II Kafironda Explosives in Mufulira in 1985 where the coach, former Mufulira Wanderers striker Benson “Swift” Musonda, played him in central defence. After almost three years at Kafironda, Chisala made the move to Wanderers towards the end of 1987 where he found Ashious Melu and George Lwandamina established in central defence so coach Ackim Musenge decided to play him at right-back in the upcoming season. Occasionally featuring as a defensive midfielder, Chisala played in all the games in his first season at Wanderers, winning the 1988 Independence Cup when Wanderers beat Roan United 3–0, and the Champion of Champions trophy after a 3–2 victory over Kabwe Warriors. His performances were rewarded with the club's Footballer of the Year award for 1989 and when Melu left to pursue a professional career in Greece, Chisala dropped into defence where he cemented his position, and his commanding height saw him easily slot in though he was equally comfortable in midfield, scoring a number of goals and was soon after named captain of the team. He would go on to win the Heroes and Unity in 1991 when Wanderers beat Nkana 2–1 in an exciting final in Kitwe and another Champion of Champions Cup in 1992 following another clash with Nkana which Wanderers won 2–0. Wanderers would however twice finish as runners-up to Nkana in the league in 1989 and 1992. After Wanderers failed to win any silverware in 1993, Chisala left the following year to join Extension Gunners in Lobatse, where former Wanderers and Zambia coach Samuel ‘Zoom’ Ndhlovu was in charge. He also linked up with former Wanderers team-mate Francis Chisenga and the duo helped Gunners win the Botswana Premier League title in 1994.

It is an extreme form of misogyny, the policing of women's compliance to patriarchal gender expectations. Misogynist terrorism uses mass indiscriminate violence in an attempt to avenge nonconformity with those expectations or to reenforce the perceived superiority of men. Misogynist terrorism often targets representatives or stand-ins for a type of person that the terrorist feels anger toward. For instance, some have been motivated by a perception of entitlement to sex with women of a type the perpetrator sees as attractive. These attacks, some arising from the incel subculture, have targeted both women and men seen as sexually successful. Since 2018, misogynist or male supremacist ideology has been listed and tracked by counter-terrorist organizations as an emerging terrorist threat.  Recognition  According to the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT) at the Hague, counter-terrorism experts were slow to recognize misogyny as an animating ideology for acts of mass violence in comparison to recognition of other ideologies. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) have tracked misogyny or male supremacy as a motivation for terrorism since 2018, describing it as a \\"rising threat.\\" Blogger Jessica Valenti was influential in designating these acts as misogynist terrorism.  Motivations  Misogyny is common among mass killers, even among those who kill for other reasons. Following are specifically misogynist motivations that have been given as primary reasons for indiscriminate mass killings.  Sexual entitlement  Mass murderers, in some cases identifying as incels, have described being motived by a perception of entitlement to sex or companionship with attractive women, a desire to seek vengeance for the perception of being rejected by women, and a drive to put women \\"in their place.\\" For example, in the 2014 Isla Vista attack, the perpetrator set out to \\"punish all females for the crime of depriving me of sex.\\" Incel ideology has been a contributing factor to 90 fatalities and injuries since this attack, as of early 2020. Sexual entitlement, alone, has been a primary motivator for acts of terror. The ICCT have found that anti-feminist conspiracy theories are typically combined with other far-right ideologies in motivating terrorists; however, sexual entitlement may be a motivation that stands by itself.  Male supremacism  In some attacks or threats of terrorism the perpetrator has described desire to reenforce male superiority in a sexual hierarchy by preventing women from being recognized for their work or tolerated in leadership positions. For example, feminist video game critic Anita Sarkeesian received threats of mass shooting and bombing unless a ceremony in which she was to be given an award were canceled. The ICCT argueshttp://icct.nl/publication/male-supremacism-and-the-hanau-terrorist- attack-between-online-misogyny-and-far-right-violence/ that the Hanau terrorist attack, although the perpetrator also had some beliefs about sex in common with the incel subculture, should be understood as motivated instead by male supremacism.  Proving manhood  Valenti writes that some misogynist terrorists have been motivated by a desire to live up to a stereotype that \\"real men\\" are powerful through violence. Incel beliefs can include an abhorrence of men who are perceived as sexually successful with women. Male victims of misogynist violence have been targeted because of a desperation to assert superiority over these men.  Targeting stand-ins  As is typical of terrorism, these acts are intended to cause widespread fear. Any woman may reasonably be unsettled about the potential of being targeted, notes philosopher Kate Manne, because often victims of these killings are treated as essentially interchangeable. Women are targeted merely because they fit a certain type rather than because they have any particular relationship to the killer. Misogyny need not mean hostility to women universally, or even very generally. Instead, misogynist terrorists often express desire to target women of a particular type, as revenge for perceived slights, or because of a perceived connection of the targeted women with feminism. However, the women targeted have no actual connection to a terrorist targeting indiscriminately; instead they are viewed as representatives or stand-ins for the women he wishes to harm.  Responses  Like other forms of terrorism, misogynist extremist violence is intended to make a political statement. However, political responses to this form of terrorism have been less proactive than the governmental response to Islamic terrorism and other forms of terrorism. Counter-terrorist response is complicated by cultural attitudes toward misogynist crimes in general. Such crimes tend to be viewed as a \\"private issue\\" rather than a proper political subject. Further, because incel attacks sometimes target both men and women indiscriminately, the gender-based motivation of these attacks has been difficult to recognize. The 2020 Toronto machete attack, in which the perpetrator was associated with an incel group, was the first instance in which a government charged someone with terrorism on the basis of a misogynist ideology. Australian researchers have recommended securitisation of incel ideology, as has been done for other ideologies that animate terrorism. Jessica Valenti recommends that feminism build a helpful alternative culture for young men, as it has successfully for young women, which would give young men an alternative to misogynist online communities when seeking respite from mainstream culture's constraints.

The factory produces puree and paste.  History  The factory was established by Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana's first president. Construction was completed in 1961, along with several other factories built around the same time to further the Nkrumah government's policy of import substitution. However, the factory did not begin operating until 1973. After an extended closure, it recommenced operations in 2006 as Northern Star Tomato Company. At that time, it did not operate at full capacity. In 2009, the Ministry of Trade and Industry provided funding to pay staff salaries and purchase tomatoes from farmers. As of 2011, the factory had the capacity to handle 500 tonnes of raw tomatoes per day. It underwent its most recent corporate reorganisation in 2014.
