Police version  According to the Madhya Pradesh police, the undertrials had escaped from the prison using bed sheets and wooden logs, after allegedly killing a jail security guard using spoons and plates.  Staged encounter  Various proofs (audio tapes and videos) have emerged that the encounter killings could be staged. The leaked police control room audio clips clearly indicates that the operation was staged and there were orders from the top to kill all the prisoners. According to the tape police officers were angry over the killing of one of their officer during the prison break. The tape also suggests that police was also concerned over repeated prison break of those prisoners. During their last prison break they killed a jail guard and they repeated the same plan again. In a low quality video, it was shown that a police officer shot a terrorist when he was lying half dead along with his mates. The senior officials also praised the police guards for the encounter.  Responses  The kin of the killed prisoners have come out accusing the police of staging the encounter. Zulekha Bee accused that her brother was already threatened to be killed in a fake encounter by the jail authorities. Pervez Alam, the lawyer of seven killed prisoners, said that \\"It is a fake encounter, a cold-blooded murder. It was pre-planned murder and I believe they did not escape the jail, but they were made to flee by the police\\". The Shiv Sena mouth piece 'Saamna' argued that the killing were justified even if it was 'staged encounter'.

The site is private property and open to the public by appointment with Claudie LLewellyn (who lives in Montauban de Picardie : 06 11 30 76 35). Geography Located in the small village of La Boisselle, the site lies south of the D 929 Albert‚ÄìBapaume road and occupies a small area in the south-east of the village (see photographs). Once the location of a small number of houses, is now covered with grass and shrubs and separated from the built over areas of the village by the rue Georges Cuvillier (D 104) leading to Contalmaison in the north and the route de B√©court leading to B√©cordel- B√©court in the east. History La Boisselle is a settlement dating back to pre-Roman times.The La Boisselle Project: project details, access date: 4 November 2016 The D 929 Albert‚ÄìBapaume road follows the course of a Roman road. After the Battle of Bapaume during the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871), the village suffered serious damage. A farmstead that existed on the present site was ruined during the war and eventually demolished in 1883 by its owners, the Berchon family. The farm was later rebuilt and expanded before the First World War; it was a place of armed struggle during the first war on surface trenches and in depth with mining galeries and mines explosions opposing french then British troops against German troops. It shows several mine craters and a mining galerie. The terrain was never modified after WW1. 1914 During the Battle of Albert (25‚Äì29 September 1914), French units were forced back from Bapaume but were able to stop the German advance along the D 929 Albert‚ÄìBapaume road at La Boisselle. After their advance had been brought to a halt, the Germans brought in heavy artillery and began to shell the French, who withdrew their infantry from the village but soon began to fortify their remaining positions with underground works. On 18 December, a French attack captured the village cemetery at the west end of a German salient in La Boisselle. The French had sapped forward for several weeks and a shortage of artillery ammunition had left the Germans unable to stop the French progress. When the attack came, the French were only from the German front line and then established an advanced post only away. The French attacks forced the Germans back from the village cemetery and the western area of La Boisselle by 24 December, but the advance was stopped a short distance forward at L'√Ælot, in front of German trenches protected by barbed wire. On Christmas Day 1914, French engineers began to sink the first mine shaft at La Boisselle. Local but heavy fighting underground in the winter of 1914 and spring of 1915 also took place at nearby Fricourt, Bois Fran√ßais and Carnoy. The Germans, meanwhile, remained in the ruins of La Boisselle and fortified the ground they had gained with barbed-wire entanglements so that the front trench could be held with fewer troops. No man's land around La Boisselle varied from wide, the area of being the narrowest part. The site thus became part of the Western Front, a line that stretched from the North Sea to Switzerland and which remained essentially unchanged for most of the entire war. As a result of bloody and costly fighting for its occupation in late 1914, quickly attained a profound symbolic status with the French Breton and German troops. 1915 From January 1915 to the start of the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, was the scene of fierce underground fighting. Having started mining at La Boisselle shortly after the French, the Bavarian Engineer Regiment 1 continued digging eight galleries towards . On 5 January, French sappers were heard digging near a gallery and a camouflet was quickly placed in the gallery and blown, collapsing the French digging and two German galleries in the vicinity. A charge was blown on 12 January, which killed more than forty French soldiers. On the night of three more German mines were sprung close to . After the explosions, a large party of German troops advanced and occupied the demolished buildings but were not able to advance further against French artillery and small-arms fire. At a French counter-attack drove back the Germans and inflicted about For several more days both sides detonated mines and conducted artillery bombardments, which often prevented infantry attacks. On the night of a German sapper at La Boisselle inadvertently broke into French gallery, which was found to have been charged with explosives; a group of volunteers took racking minutes to dismantle the charge and cut the firing cables. Between April 1915 and January 1916 alone, sixty-one mines were sprung around , some with of explosives. In summer 1915, the French mine workings around La Boisselle were taken over by the Royal Engineers as the British moved into the Somme front. G.F. Fowke sent the 174th and 183rd Tunnelling Companies into the area, but at first the British did not have enough miners to take over the large number of French shafts; the problem was temporarily solved when the French agreed to leave their engineers at work for several weeks. On 24 July 1915, 174th Tunnelling Company established headquarters at Bray, taking over some 66 shafts at Carnoy, Fricourt, Maricourt and La Boisselle. After the Black Watch arrived at La Boissselle at the end of July 1915, existing trenches, originally dug by the French, were renamed by the Scottish troops which explains the presence of many Scotland-related names for the Allied fortifications in that front sector. To provide the tunnellers needed on the Somme front, the British formed the 178th and 179th Tunnelling Companies in August 1915, followed by the 185th and 252nd Tunnelling Companies in October. The 181st Tunnelling Company was also present on the Somme. At La Boisselle, elaborate precautions were taken to preserve secrecy, since no continuous front line trench ran through , which was defended by posts near the mine shafts. No man's land just south-west of La Boisselle was very narrow, at one point about wide, and had become pockmarked by many chalk craters. The underground war continued with offensive mining to destroy opposing strong points and defensive mining to destroy tunnels, which were long. Around La Boisselle, the Germans dug defensive transverse tunnels about long, parallel to the front line. In addition to digging defensive tunnels to obstruct German mining and creating offensive galleries aimed at destroying German fortifications, the Royal Engineers also dug deep wells to supply the troops with drinking water. In August 1915, the French and Germans were working at a depth of ; the size of their charges had reached . The British tunnelling companies dramatically increased the scale of mining operations by extending and deepening the system, first to and ultimately . In October 1915, the 179th Tunnelling Company began to sink a series of deep shafts in an attempt to forestall German miners who were approaching beneath the British front line. At W Shaft they went down from to and began to drive two counter- mine tunnels towards the Germans. From the right-hand gallery the sounds of German digging grew steadily louder. On 19 November 1915, 179th Tunnelling Company's commander, Captain Henry Hance, estimated that the Germans were 15 yards away and ordered the mine chamber to be loaded with of explosive. This was completed by midnight from 20‚Äì21 November. At 1.30 am on 22 November, the Germans blew their charge, filling the remaining British tunnels with carbon monoxide. Both the right and left tunnels were collapsed, and it was later found that the German blow had detonated the British charge. The wrecked tunnels were gradually re-opened, but about thirty bodies still lie in the tunnels beneath La Boisselle. 1916 On the First day of the Somme, 1 July 1916, the D 929 Albert‚ÄìBapaume road was to be the main axis of the Allied attack. The British infantry was to attack with a gap at La Boisselle, which could not to be attacked directly as the deeply-cratered ground around made direct assault on the ruined village impossible. The tunnelling companies were to make two major contributions to the Allied preparations for the battle by placing 19 large and small mines beneath the German positions along the front line and by preparing a series of shallow Russian saps from the British front line into no man's land, which would be opened at Zero Hour and allow the infantry to attack the German positions from a comparatively short distance. At La Boisselle, two mines with charges (known as No 2 straight and No 5 right) were planted at , at the end of galleries dug from Inch Street Trench by the 179th Tunnelling Company. To assist the attack on the village, two further mines, known as Y Sap and Lochnagar after the trenches from which they were dug, were placed to the north-east and the south-east of La Boisselle. These four mines were detonated by the Royal Engineers at on 1 July 1916, two minutes before Zero Hour and 15 other mines were fired along other sectors of the Somme front line. The British attack on the ruins of La Boisselle on 1 July 1916 turned into a disaster: Despite their colossal size, the Lochnagar and Y Sap mines failed to help sufficiently neutralise the German defences in the village, and the German troops had deep shelters that withstood the British artillery fire. La Boisselle was meant to fall in 20 minutes, but by the end of the first day of the battle, neither La Boisselle nor Ovillers had been taken while the III Corps divisions had lost more than . At Mash Valley, the attackers lost 5,100 men before noon, and at Sausage Valley near the crater of the Lochnagar mine, there were over 6,000 casualties ‚Äì the highest concentration on the entire battlefield. The III Corps' 34th Division suffered the worst losses of any unit that day. On 2 July, the British managed to cross , capture the German front line trench, occupy the west end of the ruined village by and to dig in near the church. The next day, the British gradually managed to drive the German units from La Boisselle, which was fully in Allied hands by 6 July. As the Allied advance continued down the D 929 Albert‚ÄìBapaume road until the end of the Battle of the Somme in mid-November, became redundant. Barton estimates that over 120 British and French miners died in the underground fighting on the site.Barton also made a television documentary on the archaeology of , which was shown on UK television as \\"The Somme: Secret Tunnel Wars\\" BBC Four (first aired on 20 May 2013), see , access date 31 October 2016. After the war After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the former inhabitants of La Boisselle returned and became private land again, although the farm and the other houses that had stood there before the First World War were not rebuilt. The deeply-cratered ground was left to the elements and the site gradually overgrew with grass and shrubs, thus preserving many wartime features of this former sector of the front line. is not normally open to the public,upon appointment. Exploration In 2011, British researchers around Peter Barton started archaeological, historical, technological and genealogical study of La Boisselle with special focus on . After removal of bushes and undergrowth, excavations revealed that the site still holds traces of trenches, shelters and extensive tunnels related to underground warfare./> A network of some of tunnels at depths of between and has so far been rediscovered.

Life  Johann August Wilhelm Sohn was born 29 August 1829, in Berlin, Germany. In 1847, he went to D√ºsseldorf, where he studied at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf (D√ºsseldorf Art Academy) with Rudolf Wiegmann, Theodor Hildebrandt, Wilhelm von Schadow and his uncle, Karl Ferdinand Sohn. After that, he supplemented his studies by traveling extensively. In 1861, he married his cousin, Sophie Emilie (Emmy) Sohn, making Karl Ferdinand his uncle and father-in-law.Christ on the Stormy Waters In keeping with the spirit of the D√ºsseldorf school of painting, he began by painting Biblical history scenes; notably \\"Christ on the Stormy Waters\\". Several works on religious themes remained unfinished, as he discovered the Dutch Masters and turned to genre painting. Although Naturalism began to establish itself as an art style following the German revolutions of 1848‚Äì49, conservative styles remained in force at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, until Schadow was ousted as Director in 1859. At that time, Sohn became one of the first to teach the new styles, and was named the first Professor of Genre Painting in 1874 (a position he had declined in 1867). His new duties kept him so busy, he was unable to finish a commission for a monumental painting from the National Gallery, which he worked on intermittently for 30 years. Despite this heavy schedule, he also presided over a popular painting school for women. In 1885, his wife Emmy had a stroke while they were on an evening walk and died later that day. Not long after, his son fell ill with a brain disorder that eventually left him paralyzed. In 1895, he resigned his Professorship, moved to P√ºtzchen, near Bonn, to look after his son. He died in P√ºtzchen four years later, on 16 March 1899.

The figures are of great, poignant truth: an old lady, who asks for an advocate to settle an inheritance dispute, but does not receive the one she wishes. It is uncertain how the young girl dressed in black, with a lovely, bashful face, is related to the older couple.

A variant for suburban transport was called Renault PY. History In 1926, the Soci√©t√© des transports en commun de la r√©gion parisienne (STCRP), the predecessor of the RATP, made its first major order of buses to Renault, after a minor order of Renaults KX Express. The order consisted of 50 (47 delivered) new low-floor models with rear entry, called Renault PN. 330 PNs were delivered between 1927 and 1930. The PNs were on service until the 1950s. In 1929, Renault introduced a PN version for suburban use, called PY. 25 were delivered and they were retired from service in 1939. Technical details Both the PN and the PY have the same engine, a 5.03-litre flathead inline-four unit, with a power output between at 1,000 rpm and at 1,500 rpm. The radiator is located at the back of the engine. The buses' length is between (PY) and (PN), the width is of and the wheelbase of . The buses have double wheels on the rear. The early models used solid rubber tyres that were later replaced by pneumatics, improving comfort. The gearbox is a 4-speed manual unit. The first vehicles delivered have cone clutch while later models incorporated a disc clutch. The capacity of the PN is of 39 passengers. The main differences between the PN and the PY are related to the chassis structure. The PN has a forward control style design, with the driver sat over the engine and a low-entry platform on the rear. The PY has more conventional design, with the driver behind the engine compartment and passenger access through a sidefront door.

As of 2013 it was the single most valuable public university presidential residence in the United States. History Built in 1907 by lumber baron Edwin Ames and his wife, the heiress Maud Walker Ames, Hill-Crest was in 1931 bequeathed to the University of Washington, along with most of the rest of the substantial Walker-Ames fortune. The university took possession of the property in 1932 with president Lyle Spencer becoming the mansion's first university occupant. The conditions of the bequest require the president of the university maintain permanent residence in the home and a 2006 request by president Mark Emmert to maintain a separate residence was rejected by the university's board of regentsdespite a flooded basement and other problems with the propertyas it would have forced the university to sell the house. In the early 2000s the property underwent an $800,000 renovation, following which a $2 million endowment was established by former football player Jim Houston to guarantee its perpetual upkeep. University president Michael K. Young was married at Hill-Crest in 2011. Previous presidential residences The University president's first residence was a wood frame structure located between Fourth Avenue and Fifth Avenue in downtown Seattle. It was occupied from 1861 to 1895. The former New York Pavilion of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition was subsequently renovated to serve as the seat of the president, which it continued to do until 1927 when it was converted for use as academic space.

The total interior footprint is ; interiors are decorated in wood paneling, principally Douglas fir and Honduran mahogany. There is a separate carriage house. Hill-Crest's approximate market value, in 2013, was $8.5 million making it then the single most expensive public university presidential residence in the United States and more valuable than the Washington Governor's Mansion.

Traditional stereotypes of men as socially dominant, along with related traits such as misogyny and homophobia, can be considered \\"toxic\\" due in part to their promotion of violence, including sexual assault and domestic violence. The socialization of boys in patriarchal societies often normalizes violence, such as in the saying \\"boys will be boys\\" with regard to bullying and aggression. Self-reliance and emotional repression are correlated with increased psychological problems in men such as depression, increased stress, and substance abuse. Toxic masculine traits are characteristic of the unspoken code of behavior among men in prisons, where they exist in part as a response to the harsh conditions of prison life. Other traditionally masculine traits such as devotion to work, pride in excelling at sports, and providing for one's family, are not considered to be \\"toxic\\". The concept was originally used by authors associated with the mythopoetic men's movement such as Shepherd Bliss to contrast stereotypical notions of masculinity with a \\"real\\" or \\"deep\\" masculinity that they say men have lost touch with in modern society. Critics of the term argue that its meaning incorrectly implies gender-related issues are caused by inherent male traits. Etymology and usage The term toxic masculinity originated in the mythopoetic men's movement of the 1980s and 1990s. It later found wide use in both academic and popular writing. Popular and media discussions in the 2010s have used the term to refer to traditional and stereotypical norms of masculinity and manhood. According to the sociologist Michael Flood, these include \\"expectations that boys and men must be active, aggressive, tough, daring, and dominant\\". Mythopoetic movement Some authors associated with the mythopoetic men's movement have referred to the social pressures placed upon men to be violent, competitive, independent, and unfeeling as a \\"toxic\\" form of masculinity, in contrast to a \\"real\\" or \\"deep\\" masculinity that they say men have lost touch with in modern society. The academic Shepherd Bliss proposed a return to agrarianism as an alternative to the \\"potentially toxic masculinity\\" of the warrior ethic. Sociologist Michael Kimmel writes that Bliss's notion of toxic masculinity can be seen as part of the mythopoetic movement's response to male feelings of powerlessness at a time when the feminist movement was challenging traditional male authority: Academic usage In the social sciences, toxic masculinity refers to traditional cultural masculine norms that can be harmful to men, women, and society overall; this concept of toxic masculinity is not intended to demonize men or male attributes, but rather to emphasize the harmful effects of conformity to certain traditional masculine ideal behaviors such as dominance, self- reliance, and competition. Toxic masculinity is thus defined by adherence to traditional male gender roles that consequently stigmatize and limit the emotions boys and men may comfortably express while elevating other emotions such as anger. It is marked by economic, political, and social expectations that men seek and achieve dominance (the \\"alpha male\\"). In a gender studies context, Raewyn Connell refers to toxic practices that may arise out of what she terms hegemonic masculinity, rather than essential traits. Connell argues that such practices, such as physical violence, may serve to reinforce men's dominance over women in Western societies. She stresses that such practices are a salient feature of hegemonic masculinity, although not always the defining features. Terry Kupers describes toxic masculinity as involving \\"the need to aggressively compete and dominate others\\"Kupers, quoted in and as \\"the constellation of socially regressive male traits that serve to foster domination, the devaluation of women, homophobia and wanton violence\\". According to Kupers, toxic masculinity includes aspects of \\"hegemonic masculinity\\" that are socially destructive, \\"such as misogyny, homophobia, greed, and violent domination\\". He contrasts these traits with more positive traits such as \\"pride in [one's] ability to win at sports, to maintain solidarity with a friend, to succeed at work, or to provide for [one's] family\\". Feminist author John Stoltenberg has argued that all traditional notions of masculinity are toxic and reinforce the oppression of women. Gender norms According to social learning theory, teaching boys to suppress vulnerable emotions, as in the saying \\"big boys don't cry\\", is a significant part of gender socialization in Western society. According to Kupers, toxic masculine norms are a feature of life for men in American prisons, where they are reflected in the behavior of both staff and inmates. The qualities of extreme self-reliance, domination of other men through violence, and avoiding the appearance of either femininity or weakness, comprise an unspoken code among prisoners. Suppressing vulnerable emotions is often adopted in order to successfully cope with the harsh conditions of prison life, defined by punishment, social isolation, and aggression. These factors likely play a role in suicide among male prisoners. Toxic masculinity can also take the form of bullying of boys by their peers and domestic violence directed toward boys at home. The often violent socialization of boys produces psychological trauma through the promotion of aggression and lack of interpersonal connection. Such trauma is often disregarded, such as in the saying \\"boys will be boys\\" with regard to bullying. The promotion of idealized masculine roles emphasizing toughness, dominance, self-reliance, and the restriction of emotion can begin as early as infancy. Such norms are transmitted by parents, other male relatives, and members of the community. Media representations of masculinity on websites such as YouTube often promote similar stereotypical gender roles. Some traditionally prescribed masculine behaviors can produce such harmful effects as violence (including sexual assault and domestic violence), promiscuity, risky and/or socially irresponsible behaviors including substance abuse, and dysfunction in relationships. Health effects The American Psychological Association has warned that \\"traditional masculinity ideology\\" is associated with negative effects on mental and physical health. Men who adhere to traditionally masculine cultural norms, such as risk-taking, violence, dominance, primacy of work, need for emotional control, desire to win, and pursuit of social status, tend to be more likely to experience psychological problems such as depression, stress, body image problems, substance abuse and poor social functioning. The effect tends to be stronger in men who also emphasize \\"toxic\\" masculine norms, such as self-reliance, seeking power over women, and sexual promiscuity or \\"playboy\\" behavior. The social value of self-reliance has diminished over time as modern American society has moved more toward interdependence. Both self-reliance and the stifling of emotional expression can work against mental health, as they make it less likely for men to seek psychological help or to possess the ability to deal with difficult emotions. Preliminary research suggests that cultural pressure for men to be stoic and self-reliant may also shorten men's lifespans by causing them to be less likely to discuss health problems with their physicians. Toxic masculinity is also implicated in socially-created public health problems, such as elevated rates of alcoholism and certain types of cancer among men, or the role of ‚Äútrophy-hunting‚Äù sexual behavior in rates of transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Psychiatrist Frank Pittman wrote about the ways in which men are harmed by traditional masculine norms, suggesting this includes shorter lifespans, greater incidence of violent death, and ailments such as lung cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.

Early life and education Gharib was born in September 1953 in the city of Tripoli in Northern Lebanon to a poor family of six children. His father was a Lebanese army soldier. After the retirement of his father from the army, the family moved to Rahbeh, their original town in Akkar in the north where he joined its official primary and secondary school. Gharib in the Union of Lebanese Democratic Youth During this period Gharib joined the Union of Lebanese Democratic Youth, a secular left-wing youth organization where he met with communists who attracted him with their ideas of social justice and equality. He continued his university studies in the Lebanese University in Beirut, where he studied chemistry in the faculty of education. Career After graduation, Gharib became a public secondary school teacher in chemistry, first in the city of Saida in the south where he taught Ibrahime Al-Amine, the current general director of Akhbar newspaper. Afterwards, he moved to teach in Beirut in the public and the private sectors. He remained an active teacher despite the big load that he had after becoming the Leader of the League of Public Secondary Teachers and later the coordinator of the Syndicate Coordination Committee that was formed between the union and leagues of public and private teachers and the public employees. Under his leadership, the unions organized continuous demonstrations demanding increases in the wages and proposing progressive taxes and more taxation on the interests and real estate companies. The popular movements lasted from 2012 till 2015 with diverse actions including sit-ins, demonstrations, and general strikes. In addition to the governmental and presidential palaces, the ministry of finance and the ministry of education, the demonstrations reached the economic ports of the country like the sea port and the airport. Gharib leading a demonstration for teachers and public employees Due to escalating discourse and action against the government and persisting stances on the rights of the teachers and employees, the political parties loyal to the government formed a large coalition in the teachers syndicate elections to defeat Hanna Gharib and they succeeded in doing so after forming a list supported by 11 parties against the list of Gharib which got 46% of the votes despite all odds. This ended Gharib's career in the leadership of the unions. During this time, Gharib was a leading member of the Lebanese Communist Party where he raised in ranks to its central committee then its political bureau for two terms. With increased public presence and media coverage, he was a well-known public figure in Lebanon especially among the communists and left-wing supporters. After the party's 11th conference in April 2016, Gharib was elected by consensus as the general secretary of the party. He is the seventh leader of the party after Fuad Shemali, Farajallah el-Helou, Nicolas Shawi, George Hawi, Farouk Dahrouj, and Khaled Hadadi. Personal life Gharib is married to Wafaa Bitar, the daughter of Isber Bitar who was one of the historical figures of the Lebanese Communist Party. He has a son, Walid, and a daughter, Hala.

She has worked in many telenovelas and TV series broadcast by Rede Globo. Biography Mautner was born in Rio de Janeiro on May 24, 1975. She is the only daughter of famous singer and writer Jorge Mautner and historian Ruth Mendes, and is of Austrian-Jewish and Yugoslav descent on her father's side. She initially debuted as an actress, portraying Paula in the 1991‚Äì92 telenovela Vamp, and also appeared in an episode of the TV series Voc√™ Decide, but later abandoned the acting career to become involved in directing. She debuted as assistant director in the first season of the long-running soap opera Malha√ß√£o in 1995, but wouldn't direct her first telenovela until O Cravo e a Rosa from 2000. In 2012, Mautner and Ricardo Waddington (who would become one of her most frequent collaborators) won the Pr√™mio Contigo! de TV, in the category \\"Best Director\\", for Cordel Encantado. After her work in the successful Avenida Brasil which was nominated to the International Emmy Award for Best Telenovela, (which won her yet another Pr√™mio Contigo! de TV for Best Director in 2013) and Joia Rara, she was promoted to Rede Globo's art director in 2014. On an interview to √âpoca magazine from September 15, 2016, she stated that after she ended work on her most recent telenovela, A Regra do Jogo (2015‚Äì16), which was nominated to the International Emmy Award for Best Telenovela, she would take a temporary break from TV in order to begin work on her first full-length film, an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel The Gambler. It will enter pre-production in 2017, after she finds a screenwriter and an appropriate actor for the leading role, and shooting will begin in Argentina in 2018. On June 26, 2017, she expressed her desire to direct a film adaptation of Raphael Montes' 2014 thriller novel Dias Perfeitos. She was originally slated to return to television in 2018, to direct the upcoming telenovela √ìrf√£os da Terra (initially known as Sal da Terra), by Duca Rachid and Thelma Guedes, who also wrote Joia Rara; however, this did not come to fruition. On December 19, 2016, it was reported that she began work on a miniseries based on Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, scheduled to be broadcast in 2018 by Rede Globo; Caio Blat and Carolina Dieckmann are being eyed to star. In 2017 she was chosen to direct the biographical miniseries Ass√©dio, written by Maria Camargo and inspired by the non-fiction book A Cl√≠nica, by Vicente Vilardaga, about the life and crimes of rapist and former physician Roger Abdelmassih, who was portrayed by Antonio Calloni. The series' 10 episodes premiered on September 21, 2018 on Globo's streaming service Globoplay. Despite her success, Mautner is often criticized by the actors she has worked with and other acquaintances as being too \\"strict\\" and \\"perfectionist\\". In 2017 it was reported that she fell out in favor with many of Rede Globo's telenovela writers, allegedly because of her \\"temperamental\\" demeanor, creative divergences with Jo√£o Emanuel Carneiro and the lukewarm reception of A Regra do Jogo. Personal life Mautner was married to actor Marcos Palmeira from 2005 to 2012. The couple had a daughter, J√∫lia, born 2007.

Previously, it had served on anti- aircraft (AA) duties in the United Kingdom and Normandy. Origin The battery was raised in May 1941 as part of 92nd S/L Regiment, Royal Artillery, the last all-male S/L regiment to be formed in the British Army. 92nd S/L Regiment comprised 556, 557, 558 S/L Btys and was assigned to 53rd Light AA Brigade in 4th AA Division. 53rd Light AA Brigade's role was to provide S/L cover for the North Midlands of England.Farndale, Annex D, p. 259; Annex M, p. 341.92 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79. In the summer of 1941, 92nd S/L Rgt transferred to a new 70th AA Bde in 4th AA Division. Then in October 557th Bty was attached directly to 5 AA Group (which had replaced 4th AA Division), and by 24 February 1943 it was formally detached from 92 S/L Rgt, which had transferred back to 53rd AA Bde.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, TNA file WO 212/83. Independent battery On 1 June 1943 the battery was at Toft Hall Camp in Cheshire, where it came under command of the newly-formed 76th AA Bde HQ at nearby Peover Hall at Knutsford, which was training for the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord).76 AA Bde War Diary, 1943, TNA file WO 166/11247. Mobile S/L units had their own Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) detachments, and 'N' S/L Battery Workshop was formed on 18 May 1943 at the REME Mobilisation and Holding Centre, Bestwood Camp, Arnold, Nottinghamshire. It was formally designated 557 S/L Battery Workshop on 3 June and mobilised for overseas service on 29 June. It travelled to join the battery at Oulton Park Camp, Tarporley, Cheshire, on 4 August.557 S/L Bty Workshop War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/13609. 557 S/L Battery left Oulton Camp on 3 January 1944, when it moved to Southend-on-Sea. From here its individual Troops went to practise 'Canopy' S/L defences at RAF stations at Bradwell-on-Sea, Coltishall and Twinwood Farm.557 S/L Bty War Diary January‚ÄìJune 1944, TNA file WO 166/14913. 76th AA Bde HQ was to be part of the initial assault forces on D-Day, while 557 S/L Bty was among the follow-up units, so in April 1944 it was transferred from 76 AA Bde to 51st AA Defence HQ in 21st Army Group, then to 103rd AA Bde, and finally to 107th AA Bde, which was scheduled to cross to Normandy after D-Day. The battery moved to Nettlebed in Oxfordshire where it was joined by a small signals section of the Royal Corps of Signals in preparation for its mobile role.Routledge, Table XLIX, p. 319. Normandy 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, as used for 'artificial moonlight', displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth Finally, 557 S/L Bty embarked at Gosport on 26 July and landed in Normandy the following day, where it came under the command of 100th AA Bde until 107th AA Bde HQ arrived and took over on 12 August. On arrival, A Troop and a section of B Troop were deployed to defend Caen, where a S/L lorry was burnt out by enemy shellfire on 3 August. The remainder of B Troop deployed south of Caen on 10 August.557 S/L Bty War Diary July‚ÄìDecember 1944, TNA file WO 171/1214.Routledge, p. 314. On 7 August, 344th Independent S/L Bty provided 'artificial moonlight' (or 'Monty's Moonlight') for a night attack south of Caen (Operation Totalize); officers of 557th S/L Bty attended to gain experience in this new technique. 557th's lights obtained several good illuminations during a Luftwaffe night raid on 15 August, and C Trp was deployed under 80th AA Bde to defend the bridges over the River Orne, and then moved forward to the bridges at St-Pierre-sur-Dives. Breakout As 21st Army Group's breakout from the beachhead got under way, A and B Trps were sent forward on 22 August to defend Troarn and Falaise, while a section of A Trp provided lighting for Royal Engineers (RE) working parties. By early September, the battery was with 107th AA Bde assisting the River Somme crossings.Routledge, Table L, p. 327. It then made a diversion to Le Havre where it provided artificial moonlight for the attack by I Corps on the night of 10/11 September (Operation Astonia) ‚Äìwhen it proved particularly valuable for ensuring safe passage through gaps cut in the minefields ‚Äì and then lighting for the continued fighting in the town and docks.Routledge, p. 317.Doherty, p 108. While C Trp went to the newly-captured bridge at Nijmegen, the rest of the battery assisted at the Siege of Dunkirk.Routledge, Table LI, p. 330. In October the battery joined II Canadian Corps in the Battle of the Scheldt (Operation Switchback), providing 'moonlight' for the attack on South Beveland and AA Defence for the Canadian gun lines.76 AA Bde War Diary, 1944, TNA file WO 171/1084. Afterwards, it provided lighting for bridge and airfield construction, and AA defence for the bridges at Grave (A Trp), Mook (B Trp) and Nijmegen (C Trp) that had been captured during Operation Market Garden. In mid-November most of the battery relieved 344 and 356 S/L Btys at Nijmegen where the two vital bridge were under regular attack from the air and from frogmen with explosive charges, so that searchlights had to sweep the river as well as the sky.557 S/L Bty War Diary October‚ÄìDecember 1944, summary at RA Netherlands.Routledge, p. 325, Table LII, p. 331‚Äì2. For the rest of 1944 and into January 1945, the battery remained at Nijmegen, under 74th AA Bde in First Canadian Army, with A Trp detached to Grave.Routledge, Table LIII, p. 342. 557 (Ind) M/L Bty War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/5103.557 M/L Bty Workshop War Diary January‚ÄìOctober 1945, TNA file WO 171/7088. Moonlight batteries At the end of January, in preparation for Operation Veritable, the battery began experiments to put a 90 cm searchlight onto a Canadian Ram tank with its turret removed, while the electric generator was placed in an accompanying tank. (The obsolete Rams were also being used as turretless armoured personnel carriers known as Kangaroos.) The aim was to give greater cross-country mobility to the lights. A section of C Troop began operating these vehicles in support of 15th (Scottish) Division during Veritable. However, this project was not proceeded with, because existing Canal Defence Lights on Grant tank chassis were brought of out storage and operated by 49th Armoured Personnel Carrier Regiment of 79th Armoured Division.Ellis, p. 384.Doherty, pp. 48, 166‚Äì7. When Veritable opened on 9 February, 557 Bty supported the attack by 3rd Canadian Division and 15th (Scottish) Division, providing low-intensity lighting for routes and marshalling areas. Four of the battery's 90 cm light, with their generators, were mounted on steel towers constructed by the Royal Engineers.Routledge, p. 350.Martin, pp. 229, 236. The following day the battery's lights were called upon to illuminate roads, and particularly to help a Canadian brigade in danger from floods. After their success in Veritable, the independent S/L batteries providing movement light were reorganised, officially redesignated 'Moonlight Batteries', and assigned directly to corps HQs. Between 5 and 14 March, 557 (Ind) S/L Bty was broken up at Vilvoorde to form 557 and 582 (Independent) Moonlight Batteries, each with about 250 men and 24 S/Ls, and a REME workshop of 33 men. These were assigned to II Canadian Corps and XXX Corps respectively as those formations assembled troops and equipment for the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder).582 (Ind) M/L Bty War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/5105.Routledge, pp. 351‚Äì3.Routledge, Table LVI, p. 365. 557 Moonlight Battery II Canadian Corps was only peripherally involved in the early stages of Plunder, but the necessary build-up of material involved much night movement, and the deployment of lights included deception sites. The lights were used for several nights before the actual assault to 'accustom the Germans to their use'.Saunders, p. 58. Nor did the battery entirely give up its AA role: on the night of 26 March it engaged a formation of three aircraft and claimed one Category B 'kill' with 20mm gun fire. The work was also dangerous: mines were plentiful, searchlight positions were singled out for retaliatory fire, and two of A Trp's forward S/Ls and equipment had to be abandoned for several days under machine gun and mortar fire. The battery borrowed two tanks from 25 Canadian Tank Delivery Squadron to reconnoitre the position, and the equipment was finally recovered. Meanwhile, A Troop deployed detachments as infantry in daytime to protect the flanks of the supply route to the advancing Canadians. Once II Canadian Corps was across the Rhine at Emmerich, A Trp supported the advance of 4th Canadian Armoured Division, B Trp 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and C Trp 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, all providing movement light and fighting light virtually every night, and also floodlighting for the engineers bridging the river. Occasionally the battery's 20 mm guns were called upon for ground shooting. When the German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath came into effect on 5 May, 557 M/L Bty had reached Borken. Its detached Troops rejoined Battery HQ (BHQ), and all 24 S/Ls were used to illuminate the huge Prisoner of war concentration guarded by 2nd Canadian Division. Orders to disband were received on 2 August, when the battery was at Aurich, but its vehicles were still being used to transport German refugees in September, and final disbandment was only completed on 31 October. 582 Moonlight Battery The Battery formed on 5 March 1945 at Vilvoorde under the command of Major A.L. Wright, and referred to itself as 'Wright's Irregulars'. For Operation Plunder, A Trp supported 3rd Division and B Trp Guards Armoured Division, which were the follow-up forces, while C Trp was assigned to 51st (Highland) Division, which led the assault. During the operation the battery provided artificial moonlight for XXX Corps' forming up areas, while half a squadron of CDLs of 49th APC Rgt illuminated the assault crossing on 23/24 March and engaged the enemy on the far bank with their 75mm guns.Scull.Doherty, pp. 166‚Äì7. C Trp, also providing fighting light, came under air attack during the night. Artificial moonlight was not universally welcomed by the assaulting troops, some feeling that they were silhouetted while crossing the river.Saunders, p. 68. C Trp crossed the Rhine on the afternoon of 28 March, followed the next day by BHQ. The Troops continued to advance with their respective divisions, lighting routes and bridge construction as well as providing fighting light. Guards Armoured decided to cloak its area in darkness, to hinder the scattered Germans from reorganising, so B Trp thickened up the lighting for 51st (H) Division. Both B and C Trps were bombed, with some casualties. A German wireless station attempted to cause confusion by broadcasting bogus orders to switch off the S/Ls. The battery provided movement light and fighting light almost nightly throughout April as XXX Corps advanced across Germany. When C Trp came under fire on 15 April a section commander was killed and two S/L projectors and their equipment were put out of action. Sergeant H. Wilson took over, applied first aid to the casualties and saw to their evacuation, then went forward under fire to assess the extent of the damage, extracting the undamaged vehicles.. He was later awarded the Military Medal. Captain A.J. Daymond, a troop commander, was awarded a Military Cross for getting a section back into action after it had suffered casualties from a German self-propelled gun and small- arms fire.Daymond's citation at WO 373/56/624. When 3rd Division assaulted across flooded country towards Bremen on 23 April, B Trp provided subdued light beams to indicate the axis of advance. C Troop then deployed a section to assist an anti-tank battery tasked with anti-submarine watch on the approaches to the port. The troop engaged one midget submarine with small arms fire. 582 Battery continued to provide fighting light for infantry attacks up to 3 May; 21st Army Group ceased fire on 5 May following the German surrender. After VE day, BHQ was established at Zeven outside Bremen to undertake occupation duties, which mainly consisted of providing security lighting for prison camps by exposing lights horizontally along the fences. Disbandment was ordered on 7 September and completed on 10 October 1945. The final War Diary entry commented 'Conclusion of the short but merry life of 'Wight's Irregulars'.'

For the most part, the buildings here were used for commercial purposes, but some of them housed light industrial operations, the post office, and the Masonic lodge. The buildings generally range from one to two stories, but a couple structures are three stories in height. Built between the 1860s and the early decades of the 20th century, the buildings are composed of masonry construction. Several were built using the areas limestone. The Italianate style is dominate, but other late 19th and 20th century revivals, and late 19th and early 20th century American movements are also found here. Other than its architecture, what makes Anamosa standout is that unlike most other Iowa city's it was never properly platted. Instead, the city grew organically from three commercial nodes. One was located in the flood plain of the Wapsipinicon River, and two others on the higher ground to the east. The two on the higher ground developed together and are the basis for this district's development. The city saw rapid development with the advent of the railroad through town and the demand for the limestone quarried from the area. The development of the Anamosa State Penitentiary beginning in the 1870s also affected the city's economic fortunes.

The building, which currently serves as a Magistrates' Court, is a Grade I listed building. History The building was commissioned to replace an earlier Sessions House which had been built in 1560 and demolished in 1768. Although a team of Robert Adam and his younger brother James Adam were selected to design the building, James took charge of the commission and the Georgian style design is credited to him. The building was completed in 1771. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with nine bays facing onto the Market Place with the end three bays on both sides slightly projected forwards; the central section of three bays featured a triple arched doorway on the ground floor and a triple sash window divided by two Ionic order columns on the first floor. A projecting clock, designed, manufactured and installed by John Briant of Hertford, was erected on the south elevation of the building in 1824. The Shire Hall was originally used to accommodate the assembly rooms and courts for the county but it also housed the town's corn exchange on the ground floor until the mid-nineteenth century. At that point the courts were relocated from the first floor to the ground floor. Pevsner describes the building as \\"completely unadorned unless the two curved projections on the north and south are accepted as ornamental\\". Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the meeting place of Hertfordshire County Council. A substantial council chamber, sometimes referred to as the \\"Round Room\\" or the \\"Rotunda\\", was established on the first floor. The Prince and Princess of Wales visited the Shire Hall on 23 July 1906. The county council moved to County Hall, a larger and more modern complex located further from the town centre, in summer 1939. The Shire Hall continued to function as a courthouse, although the Crown Court moved to St Albans in 1971, leaving the Shire Hall solely as a Magistrates' Court. The building was completely restored between 1988 and 1990 for which it was awarded a commendation by the Civic Trust in 1992.

The building, which is the headquarters of Hertfordshire County Council, is a Grade II* listed building. History The original Shire Hall for Hertfordshire was located in Fore Street in Hertford. After deciding that Shire Hall was too restricted for future expansion, county leaders chose to procure a new county headquarters: the site they selected was open land located just off Pegs Lane. Construction of the new building began in spring 1937. It was designed by James and Bywaters and Rowland Pierce in the Neo- Georgian style with Scandinavian elements; it was built by C Miskin & Son of St Albans and opened without ceremony in summer 1939. The design for the building involved an asymmetrical main frontage facing the Bullocks Lane; the left section of three bays featured a portico with four full height piers supporting a frieze with the words \\"Tertium iam annum regnante Georgio VI haec curia aedificata est\\" (\\"This building was constructed during the third year of the reign of George VI\\"); the portico contained a doorway flanked by square windows on the ground floor and it contained tall sash windows in a recess on the first floor; there was a copper-clad cupola at roof level; the right section contained a loggia of eleven bays on the ground floor and seven sash windows on the first floor. The principal room was the council chamber which was contained in a curved structure which jutted out of the main building to the west.

Calhoun, who grew up on the street, shows how disillusioned bohemians of every era have declared \\"St. Marks Is Dead\\" when their era on the street passed. The book was released on November 2, 2015, by W. W. Norton & Company. It was named by many publications one of the best books of 2015. Summary In a narrative history informed by 250 interviews and 70 rare images, St. Marks native Ada Calhoun profiles iconic characters, including W. H. Auden, Abbie Hoffman, Keith Haring, Beastie Boys, Frank O'Hara, Emma Goldman, The Velvet Underground, and New York Dolls. She argues that St. Marks has variously been an elite address, an immigrants' haven, a mafia warzone, a hippie paradise, and a backdrop to the film Kids‚Äïand always been a place that outsiders call home. The book is organized around pivotal moments throughout history when denizens declared \\"St. Marks is dead.\\" Reception St. Marks Is Dead was a New York Times Editors‚Äô Pick, Amazon.com Book of the Month, and named one of the best books of the year by Kirkus Reviews, The Boston Globe, Orlando Weekly, and New York Post. The Village Voice called it, \\"The Best Nonfiction Book About New York, 2015,\\" and said, \\"With St. Marks Is Dead, Ada Calhoun just became the most important new voice on old New York.\\" The Atlantic wrote: \\"Timely, provocative, and stylishly written ‚Ä¶Calhoun's book serves as a welcome corrective to that rallying cry [that gentrification is bad], and to the tendency to romanticize New York City in the 1970s, when the city was far more riotous and permissive than it is now. ‚Ä¶ Her aplomb, in fact, is precisely what the discussion needs. Her portrait of neighborhood resilience might suggest more temperate proposals for an increasingly polarized debate.\\" The New York Times Book Review said, \\"Calhoun, who grew up on St. Mark's Place, is careful not to romanticize any one era of the East Village (which serves as a suitable proxy for much of New York City during the past century). St. Marks Is Dead is an ecstatic roll call.\\" The book won the 2016 Independent Publisher Book Awards gold medal in U.S. History. ReferencesExternal links * St. Marks Is Dead, at W. W.

A reworking of her 1981 doctoral thesis Odi et Amo Ergo Sum (\\"I Hate and I Love, Therefore I Am\\"), [Doctoral thesis; under the name Anne Carson Giacomelli] Eros the Bittersweet \\"laid the groundwork for her subsequent publications, [‚Ä¶] formulating the ideas on desire that would come to dominate her poetic output\\", and establishing her \\"style of patterning her writings after classical Greek literature\\". Summary The book traces the concept of eros in ancient Greece through its representations in writings of the time. It examines eros as a simultaneous experience of pleasure and pain, as exemplified by a word of Sappho's creation: \\"glukupikron\\" (the \\"bittersweet\\" of the book's title). Carson considers how triangulations of desire appear in the writings of Sappho, ancient Greek novelists (Longus, Heliodorus, Achilles Tatius, and Chariton), and Plato (in his Phaedrus). Her analysis of Sappho's Fragment 31 sees \\"eros as deferred, defied, obstructed, hungry, organized around a radiant absence ‚Äì [‚Ä¶] eros as lack.\\" Reception Acclaim for Eros the Bittersweet grew in the fifteen years after it was published in 1986: in the words of John D'Agata, the book \\"first stunned the classics community as a work of Greek scholarship; then it stunned the nonfiction community as an inspired return to the lyrically based essays once produced by Seneca, Montaigne, and Emerson; and then, and only then, deep into the 1990s, reissued as 'literature' and redesigned for an entirely new audience, it finally stunned the poets.\\" By the turn of the millennium, Eros the Bittersweet had also entered into the popular consciousness, voted onto the 1999 Modern Library Reader's List for the 100 Best Nonfiction books of the 20th century, and mentioned (along with Autobiography of Red) in a 2004 episode of the television series The L Word.

They have toured Canada and the United States including doing Sketch Fest in Montreal and Vancouver as well as Just For Laughs. The group produces sketch comedy shorts that are distributed via YouTube and on their website, but have appeared on other sites as well such as Funny or Die. Goodmurphy and Steele have starred together in many television shows including the YTV show The Funny Pit with Roman Danylo, The Face of Furry Creek, CBC's The Pitch, and Out For Laughs. Steele made a memorable appearance on The Amazing Race Canada in season 2, coming in 3rd place with co-worker Rob Goddard. While Goodmurphy has been in Super Channel's Too Much Information with Geri Hall, Mark Forward and Lauren Ash, as well as Thirty Seventeen directed by Michael Coleman. The duo was short-listed for a Canadian Comedy Award in the Best Live Ensemble category in 2016. In early 2018 the duo's short film White Wine Boys Club won first prize at the Vancouver Just For Laughs Film Festival, as well as the Grand Prize competing Internationally against other JFL Film Festival winners. The Ryan and Amy Show have signed with Hadron Films to produce a 22 minute sketch comedy pilot, produced by Miles Forster & Chris Wilkinson. Members=Ryan Steele Ryan Steele grew up in the city of Langley, British Columbia, where he graduated from H. D. Stafford High School. He became interested in comedy at an early age, and started making comedy videos in his early-teens, with early successes 'Ferry Death' and 'Big Mac Attack'. After being diagnosed with testicular cancer at 19, he gave up the dream of being a comedian for a while. In his late 20s, he went to a Tony Robbins' like workshop where he was told to start doing Sketch Comedy, so he started his own ensemble sketch show. Amy Goodmurphy Amy Goodmurphy grew up in North Vancouver, British Columbia, and is a St. Thomas Aquinas Regional Secondary School alumna. She started comedy at the age of 23 after meeting Steele at the bar where he worked. He convinced her it would be worth her while to join his ensemble sketch show. It wasn't, so she started studying acting at Vancouver Acting School, graduating in 2012. Style The Ryan And Amy Show is unique in that it doesn't just do sketch comedy but is interspersed with previously recorded video. The smart transitions from video to sketch back to video is unrivaled in the industry today. Their style spans a wide variety from horror to displacement sketches. They've been described as a modern day Three's Company meets Mr. Dressup, for their affinity for tickle trunk magic and the lingering question of whether Steele may actually be straight. Kelowna Song In May 2017 the duo had a viral hit about the town of Kelowna, racking up over 150,000 hits in under a month. Performing as Mom's over Miami, they sang 'My Sharona' by the Knack but with different lyrics.

The 1861 book's five stories are Lois the Witch (124 pages), The Grey Woman (78 pages), The Doom of the Griffiths (52 pages), The Half-Brothers (20 pages), and The Crooked Branch (63 pages). Lois the Witch is a long short story or novella of historical fiction, which first appeared in 3 parts in October 1859 in the weekly All the Year Round edited by Charles Dickens. The story's protagonist, Lois Barclay, is raised in a parsonage in Barford, Warwickshire but as she becomes a young woman, both her parents die. In 1691, she crosses the Atlantic to live with her uncle and his family in Salem, Massachusetts and then becomes involved in the Salem witch trials. The book's second-longest story The Grey Woman is a Gothic tale of a young woman who, with her lady's maid, escapes from the castle of her rich, but abusive, husband Monsieur de la Tourelle. The stories The Doom of the Griffiths and The Half-Brothers were published in the 1859 collection Round the Sofa after previous publication in periodicals.

MCHP provides and uses population-based administrative data to inform health policy, social policy and health and social service delivery provincially, nationally and internationally. MCHP also creates population-based research on health and the social determinants of health. About MCHP has developed and maintains a comprehensive, population-based data repository on behalf of the Government of Manitoba for use by local, national and international research communities. The repository allows researchers to investigate the health, social and economic status of Manitobans, social determinants that influence health status and provision of appropriate health and social treatment and prevention services.http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/health_sciences/medicine/units/community_health_sciences/departmental_units/mchp/media/Healthcare_Policy_vol6_MCHP.pdf The Centre focuses primarily on the provincial context, but knowledge gained through research at MCHP has frequently been applied at the national and international levels. MCHP shares this knowledge through workshops, conferences, symposiums and research papers and media outreach. Access to repository data is permitted to researchers outside of the Centre, nationally and internationally. Research The diversity of research done at MCHP can be attributed to the large scope of data available in the population-based data repository. Historically, the primary focus has been on Manitobans‚Äô health status and the social determinants of health. However, the acquisition of social data into the repository in recent years has expanded the scope of research at MCHP to the well-being of Manitoban children, Metis and First Nations and the provision of appropriate, evidence-based services for these populations. Some examples of research topics arising from the repository include: *acute and chronic diseases; *inequities of health and healthcare use; *use of nursing homes, primary care, hospital care, emergency departments, urgent and critical care; *use of prescription drugs and alcohol; *use of family services, income assistance, and social housing; *cost of hospital care and smoking; *educational outcomes; and *evaluation of screening and prevention programs. Specifically, there are five research projects commissioned every year by Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living that are released publicly as reports. The Pathways to Health and Social Equity (PATHS) for Children research program is a five-year program comprising 15 inter- related projects that evaluate the impact of different interventions on the health and social outcomes of children in Manitoba. Other research projects are led by research scientists and graduate students both within MCHP, as well as researchers outside of the institute. Data Repository MCHP is the custodian of the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository, a large collection of person-level data about Manitoba residents that has been de- identified (anonymized) and can be linked. As of March 2016, there are 78 data files that are updated annually and a large number of additional data files that are brought in on a project- basis.http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/health_sciences/medicine/units/chs/departmental_units/mchp/media/Annual_Report_2015_16.pdf The repository can be accessed by authorized researchers, graduate students and data analysts at MCHP and at nine remote access sites located at the University of Manitoba (Bannatyne campus) and the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority. Most of these data are obtained from administrative data that are collected by MHSAL to help administer the universal healthcare system in Manitoba. Data in the repository provide information relating to health and health services use (e.g., diagnoses, prescriptions, emergency department visits), social services (e.g., income assistance, social housing, involvement with the justice system), education (e.g., Early Development Index, high school graduation) and surveys (e.g., Canadian Community Health Survey). MCHP also maintains a public documentation library (data descriptions and concept dictionary) that provides consistent information about the data files in the repository and methods for using the data in population-based research. Data descriptions provide information about the data file, relationships between data sets, data quality reports, and data dictionary with descriptive and statistical details about all data elements. The concept dictionary documents methods developed at MCHP for analyzing data in the repository, including project-specific approaches, suggested readings and references. Privacy, confidentiality and security Users of data in the repository receive training about the privacy, confidentiality and security practices at MCHP. These practices protect the privacy of service providers (e.g., doctors) and users (e.g., patients) and prevent the destruction or inappropriate use of the data. All data in the repository are stripped of information that can be used to identify individuals. Published reports do not provide data that can be linked to an easily identifiable, small group of individuals. Data are protected by a high level of physical and virtual security at access locations. Knowledge Translation Knowledge translation (KT) at MCHP is based both on integrated (start-to-finish) and end-use (information sharing tailored to the target audience) approaches. Integrated KT at MCHP includes the participation of stakeholders in research teams, advisory groups or the Need To Know Team. End-use KT at MCHP includes the presentation of research findings at conferences, workshops and briefings. MCHP holds several KT workshops every year that provide opportunities for knowledge translation and skills building for stakeholders. These events include: *MCHP-Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living Workshop; *Need To Know Workshops; *Regional Health Authorities Workshop; and *Manitoba Government Workshop. Other examples of end-use KT include sharing findings from published reports in mainstream media (TV, radio, web), social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) and academic journals. Funding Since MCHP was founded in 1991, its core funding has been provided by five-year contracts with Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL), a department of the Government of Manitoba. Additional grant- based funding supports the infrastructure, research and knowledge translation at MCHP. Maintenance and expansion of the data repository was supported with Canada for Innovation (CFI) funding in 1999 and 2010. The Need To Know Team, an ongoing knowledge translation project, was established with a Canadian Institutes for Health Research grant in 2001‚Äì2005. CFI funding also helped to establish Remote Access Sites where researchers and data analysts outside of MCHP can access the data repository. The team MCHP staffs approximately 60 personnel including researchers, data managers, research managers, data analysts, research coordinators, research support, information technologists, communications officer, finance officers, graduate students and research assistants. Collaborators MCHP collaborates with government departments and agencies which enables the maintenance and expansion of the data repository through data sharing agreements. Stakeholders that represent relevant government departments, government agencies, and service providers also participate as co-investigators or advisory group members.

Medical use was legalized in 2018 through a ballot initiative to amend the state constitution. Partial decriminalization (2014) In May 2014, Senate Bill 491 was enacted which reduced penalties for certain cannabis offenses. In particular, it eliminated the threat of jail time for first-time possession of up to 10 grams. The bill also reduced penalties related to the sale and cultivation of cannabis, and eliminated the ban on probation or parole for third-time drug felony convictions. It passed the Senate by a 29‚Äì2 vote and the House by a 140‚Äì15 vote, then became law without receiving the signature of Gov. Jay Nixon. SB 491 did not take effect until January 2017. Although penalties for cannabis were reduced under SB 491, possession of small amounts is still treated as a misdemeanor crime. For this reason the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws considers Missouri to only have partially decriminalized cannabis. CBD oil legalization (2014) In July 2014 Governor Jay Nixon signed into law the Missouri Medical Marijuana Bill, legalizing the use of CBD oil to treat persistent seizures. House Bill 2238 \\"allows the Department of Agriculture to grow industrial hemp for research purposes and allows the use of hemp extract to treat certain individuals with epilepsy\\". A neurologist must determine that the epilepsy does not respond to at least three treatment options in order for a person to be eligible. HB 2238 only allows hemp extract that contains at least 5% cannabidiol (CBD) and no more than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In 2015 the state issued licenses to two non- profits to grow cannabis for oil to be sold to patients. Medical cannabis legalization (2018) In November 2018, Missouri residents approved with 66% of the vote a ballot measure (Amendment 2) to legalize the medical use of cannabis. The measure allowed qualified patients to grow up to six cannabis plants and purchase an amount of cannabis per month to be determined by state regulators (required to be at least 4 ounces). The measure set a 4% tax rate on medical cannabis sales with proceeds to be earmarked for services for military veterans. Although some qualifying conditions are specified, the law additionally allows cannabis to be recommended for any \\"chronic, debilitating or other medical condition\\" as determined by a physician, along with any terminal illness. Also on the ballot with Amendment 2 were two other medical cannabis initiatives that were defeated. Amendment 3 contained a narrower set of qualifying conditions, a higher tax rate of 15 percent, and would not have allowed home cultivation. It failed with 32 percent of the vote. A third measure, Proposition C, was a statutory change as opposed to a constitutional amendment. It set a two percent tax rate and also contained no home grow provision. It failed with 44 percent of the vote. Municipal reforms=Columbia (2004) In November 2004, a ballot measure to decriminalize cannabis in Columbia passed with 61% of the vote. The measure stipulated that possession of up to 35 grams was to be processed in municipal court as a non- criminal offense, punishable by a maximum fine of $250. Also passed with 69% of the vote was an initiative to allow the use of cannabis with a physician's approval. A year earlier, in April 2003, a ballot measure to decriminalize cannabis in the city failed with 42% of the vote. Springfield (2012) In August 2012, the city council of Springfield voted 6‚Äì3 to enact (rather than let go to ballot) a citizen-led petition to decriminalize small amounts of cannabis. It was then repealed one month later, however, in effect blocking the proposal (which had obtained the requisite number of signatures) from appearing on the ballot. Since city council did not have this explicit power, organizers of the petition denounced the council's actions which they deemed to be illegal. A lawsuit was filed in federal court, and in April 2015 the city settled with the petition originators in the amount of $225,000. St. Louis (2013) In April 2013, the St. Louis Board of Aldermen voted 22‚Äì3 to allow police to cite individuals instead of arresting them for small amounts of cannabis. Cited persons would be processed in municipal court (instead of state court) and subject to a fine in the range of 100 to 500 dollars. The law went into effect in June 2013. Penalties were further reduced in February 2018 when the Board of Aldermen voted 24‚Äì0 to set a $25 fine for possession of up to 35 grams. Kansas City (2017) In April 2017, Kansas City residents approved with 75% of the vote a ballot measure to decriminalize up to 35 grams of cannabis. The measure eliminated the threat of jail time and reduced the penalty to a $25 fine. The penalty was later completely eliminated in July 2020 by a 9‚Äì4 city council vote. Polling In January 2014, St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay posted an informal poll on his mayoral website asking constituents whether or not they were in favor of the legalization of recreational cannabis. The published results showed that over 90% of the people who voted were in favor of legalization and 66% supported taxation upon its sale. Twenty-eight percent indicated they had used the drug in the past week.

Marnoch was a keen amateur musician and through his friendship with Charles Sanford Terry (historian), professor of history and archaeology at the University of Aberdeen he received the bound final proof of the full score of Edward Elgar's Violin Concerto. Terry was a close friend of Elgar and had been gifted the proof for his help with the proofreading of the concerto.Bryan Adams (Ed.) Elgar and his world Princeton University Press 2007 There is an annual Sir John Marnoch lecture in Aberdeen University medical school. Operation on the Duke of York Marnoch had been an army surgeon in the volunteer corps for many years and at the outbreak of war he was commissioned in the 1st Scottish General Hospital RAMC with the rank of lieutenant-colonel (latterly Brevet Colonel). Three weeks after the outbreak of war the Kings Surgeon in Scotland, Sir James Reid, received a call from the Palace asking him to go to Wick in northern Scotland. There he received Prince Albert (‚ÄòBertie‚Äô, 1895‚Äì1952), second son of the King, and the future King George VI. Prince Albert, who was serving as a midshipman on HMS Collingwood, had suffered from abdominal problems from an early age but on this occasion appendicitis was diagnosed. Reid travelled with the prince to Aberdeen on the hospital ship Rohilla. Marnoch performed an appendectomy on Albert in the Northern Nursing Home, Albyn Place, Aberdeen on 29 August 1914. The prince made a good recovery. He later returned to serve on the ship and thereafter took part in the Battle of Jutland.

QOP was developed by Jarvis Greiner and Jason Wilson of Biola University, California, as a method of objectively evaluating pitches in baseball. QOPBASEBALL is the brand of the QOP statistic. Development Greiner, one of the main contributors to the QOP statistic, was a film major and a pitcher for the Biola University baseball team in 2010. He came up with the idea for QOP while designing a statistics project for his then-professor, Wilson. He had realized that, while fastballs were generally judged by their speed, there was no standardized, quantitative measurement for other types of throws, particularly curveballs. Greiner filmed 30 of his teammates' pitches, and asked his baseball coach, John Verhoeven, to rate the pitches according to batting difficulty on a scale of 0 to 100. Afterwards, he watched the filmed pitches and obtained the pitches‚Äô initial height, breaking point, maximum height, and final location. A multiple regression model was then used to derive the initial version of the Greiner Index, a precursor to the QOP metric. The Greiner Index (GI) is calculated with the following formula, GI = -2.51rise + 1.88breakpoint ‚Äì 0.47knee_dist + 0.51total break where rise refers to the number of inches the ball rises vertically to the maximum height, break point the horizontal distance (in feet) from the release point to the maximum height, total break the number of vertical feet from the maximum ball height to the point it crosses the plate, and knee distance (also known as location) the number of inches above (positive) or below (negative) the batter‚Äôs knee. A single pitch with a 3-inch rise, 0.47 foot total break, 21.5 break point, and 8 inch location change, for example, would be calculated in this way: GI = (-2.51)(3)+(1.88)(21.5)-(0.47)(8)+(0.51)(0.47) In this case, the Greiner Index would be 53.6 points. After the Greiner Index was developed, Wilson expanded it to create the QOP metric, which then made its debut at the 2015 SABR conference. Specifically, the final location was reevaluated to take two dimensions into account, speed and horizontal break were added to the equation, and the model was generalized to include all pitches (not just curveballs). The formula for QOP is patent pending and therefore has not been published, but the statistics were made available online in 2016. The overall QOP of a pitch is increased by the following components: * Decreased rise (for curveballs) * Increased total break * Increased late vertical break * Increased horizontal break * Closeness to corners of strike zone * Increased velocity Since QOP is measured by breaking a pitch down into its individual components and analyzed from there, the pitch‚Äôs rating does not depend on the batter‚Äôs batting performance. This differentiates QOP from other commonly used pitching statistics, such as ERA (Earned Run Average). Some critics argue that the QOP metric is not truly objective because of its basis in the Greiner Index, which was calculated based on the ratings of John Verhoeven.  QOP and conventional baseball statistics  The QOP metric has been shown to have significant relationships with other, more conventional baseball statistics. When variables like pitch type, pitch count, runners on base, and times through the batting order are factored out, QOP has been demonstrated to have a statistically significant negative correlation with ERA (earned run average). In other words, a higher QOP (a better pitch) is correlated with a lower ERA (less runs earned). Wilson wrote that \\"averaged over all seasons, for players with an ERA of five or higher in one season, if they also have a QOPA [average QOP] over five, the prediction accuracy is 85.5 percent\\". Home runs per 9 innings (HR/9) has a negative relationship with QOP as well, with a peak at -0.5 that, while as of yet unexplained, can also be found in the relationship between HR/9 and mph. The QOP metric also illuminates the relationship between pitch quality and batting order: not only does pitch quality generally go down the second and third time through the batting order, but the general pattern usually remains the same each time through the order. The first and ninth batters face pitches with the highest QOP, on average, and the fourth, fifth, and eighth face the lowest. Applications Potential practical applications of QOP include tracking pitcher improvement (comparing pitches during and between seasons), scouting (if implemented on a radar gun for use in minor leagues and overseas), preventing injury (tracking significant decline throughout a season), and fan enjoyment (a potential complement to mph or rpm). It has not been proven to satisfy these applications.

As a player, he won the 1970‚Äì71 League of Ireland title with Cork Hibernians and as manager he won the 1992‚Äì93 League of Ireland Premier Division with Cork City. Family and early years O'Mahony was the son of Nora and Timothy O'Mahony and he grew up on Pearse Road in the Ballyphehane district of Cork. Two of his brothers were also League of Ireland footballers. Like Noel, Declan also played for Cork Hibernians while Pat played for Cork Celtic. Noel and Pat O'Mahony both attended Col√°iste Chr√≠ost R√≠ where Noel initially played Gaelic football before switching to association football. As a schoolboy he played for Ballyphenane United and Tramore Athletic. Pat O'Mahony also played for Athletic. In 1956 Noel O'Mahony was selected as the inaugural Cork Schoolboy Player of the Year. Playing career=Cork Hibernians During the 1960s and 1970s O'Mahony played for Cork Hibernians. Together with Miah Dennehy, John Herrick, Gerry Coyne and Dinny Allen, he was a prominent member of a successful Hibernians team managed by Dave Bacuzzi. He was invariably described as a \\"hard player\\", a \\"(take) no prisoners... centre-half\\" and as a \\"tough, no-nonsense defender\\". While playing for Hibernians, O'Mahony helped the club win the 1970‚Äì71 League of Ireland title, two FAI Cups in 1971‚Äì72 and 1972‚Äì73 and the Blaxnit Cup in 1971‚Äì72. His brother Declan also played as a goalkeeper for Hibernians and featured in the 1972‚Äì73 FAI Cup final. O'Mahony also served as team captain and played for Hibernians in Europe, including in a 1970‚Äì71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup tie against Valencia. Manager=Albert Rovers At the end of the 1975‚Äì76 season, Cork Hibernians resigned from the League of Ireland. The 1976‚Äì77 season saw them replaced by Albert Rovers with O'Mahony serving as their player-manager. O'Mahony subsequently remained in charge of Albert Rovers for most of their stay in the League of Ireland under their various guises as Cork Albert, Cork Alberts and Cork United. The highlight of his time with Alberts was guiding the club to the 1977‚Äì78 League of Ireland Cup final which they lost to Dundalk. Limerick During the 1980s County Limerick had two clubs, Limerick and Newcastle West, playing in the League of Ireland for the first time and O'Mahony managed both clubs during the course of the decade. In 1983‚Äì84 he was briefly in charge during a turbulent time for Limerick as rival factions within the club went to the High Court to decide who owned the rights to the club's name. O'Mahony also served as manager of Newcastle West. Cork City During the 1980s and 1990s O'Mahony had three spells in charge of Cork City. He was briefly in charge in 1986 before he was succeeded by Eamon O'Keefe. He was reappointed for the 1988‚Äì89 season and O'Mahony subsequently guided the club to eighth place in the league. Cork City also reached the FAI Cup final but lost to Derry City. However, because Derry City were Premier Division champions, Cork City qualified for the 1989‚Äì90 European Cup Winners' Cup. This was the first time Cork City qualified for Europe. In 1990‚Äì91 after finishing second in the Premier Division, Cork City qualified for the 1991‚Äì92 UEFA Cup. In the first round they held Bayern Munich to a 1‚Äì1 draw at Musgrave Park before eventually losing the tie 3‚Äì1 on aggregate. In 1992‚Äì93, with a team that included Phil Harrington, John Caulfield, Pat Morley, Paul Bannon, Gerry McCabe and Dave Barry, O'Mahony guided Cork City to their first Premier Division title after a series of three-way play-offs that also involved Bohemians and Shelbourne. Damien Richardson briefly took over from O'Mahony at the start of the 1993‚Äì94 but O'Mahony was re-appointed manager before the season ended. O'Mahony then became the only manager to win the League of Ireland Cup without getting the team to the final. Death and obituaries O'Mahony died peacefully on 30 May 2013 at Cork University Hospital. He was survived by his wife Noreen, partner Ann, sisters and brothers. Two weeks prior to his death, he had attended a 20-year reunion of Cork City's 1992‚Äì93 Premier Division winning team. An obituary in the Irish Examiner remarked that O'Mahony had achieved success at three of Cork city's sports stadiums. As a player with Cork Hibernians he graced P√°irc U√≠ Rinn when it was known as Flower Lodge.

Blocks C and D are Grade II listed buildings. History The oldest part of the complex, known as Block D Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it became necessary to find facilities for Essex County Council. Rather than using the shire hall for county council administration, as many other county councils did, county leaders established two small offices on the north side of King Edward's Street. Formal meetings of the full county council were held in London in the early 20th century, in order to minimise travel for county councillors working in the City of London, so there was no need for a meeting place in Essex. In due course more substantial facilities became necessary and a red brick building on Duke Street known as Block D, designed by Frank Whitmore in the classical style, was completed in 1909. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage with four bays facing Duke Street; the left bay featured an arched recess containing a doorway with a fanlight above flanked by Doric order columns and full height stone pilasters bearing the county coat of arms; there was a double window on the first floor and a triple window on the second floor with an open pediment above. When further expansion was needed, the properties in King Edward's Street were demolished and the most imposing part of the new county hall complex, a building clad in Portland Stone on the corner of Duke Street and Threadneedle Street known as Block C, designed by J. Stuart, was built between 1929 and 1939. The design featured a main entrance at the south east corner of the building; there was a doorway on the ground floor flanked by Doric order columns supporting an entablature with a pediment above; there was a round headed window on the first floor flanked by Corinthian order columns and there were smaller windows on the floors above. A geometric pattern was carved into the stonework above the doorway; this subsequently led to controversy as the carving was capable of being interpreted as a line of swastikas. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber, the committee room and the council chairman's room which were all fitted out at the expense of the businessman and philanthropist, Sir William Courtauld. A modern 3-storey building in the heart of the complex, known as Block B, followed after the Second World War and a modern 9-storey building on Victoria Road South, known as Block A, which was designed by H. Connolly, was built between 1959 and 1965.

The film stars Kalaiyarasan and Anaswara Kumar in the leading roles, with Chaya Singh and John Vijay in supporting roles. Featuring music composed by Ishaan Dev, the film which began production in 2015 and met with a couple of unexpected delays, finally managed to release in theatres on 23 November 2018.

After spending over a year meeting potential actors and producers, Jayadev met Kalaiyarasan in Chennai during August 2014 to discuss the film and after hearing the concept and storyline, Kalaiyarasan showed interest to work in the project. Jayadev reworked the screenplay and pre-production began in May 2015, with the team fixing the filming dates for August 2015. Anaswara Kumar was signed on to play the lead female role. Speaking about her role, Anaswara revealed that she would portray a college student who hails from a middle-class background, who is extremely protective of Vetri (played by Kalaiyarasan)\\". Chaya Singh revealed that she would be portraying a Bollywood actress, while Kalaiyarasan would play her mother's carer. However the film later was delayed twice, firstly as a result of Kalaiyarasan signing on to appear in Kabali and then as a result of the 2015 South Indian floods. Principal photography began on 15 December 2015 and after a schedule break, the second schedule started in February and the production was wrapped up on 28 August 2016. The film was shot entirely in and around the city of Chennai. Editing and other post production works were later completed by July 2016, with sound mixing completed at Prasad Studios by audiographer Krishnamoorthy and grading was done at Prism and Pixels by Nandhakumar.  Music  The songs and BGM are composed by Ishaan Dev and Lyrics by Murugan Manthiram & Velmurugan. *\\"Chennai Enga Ooru\\" ‚Äì Ishaan Dev *\\"Anbe Endhan\\" ‚Äì Adheef, Akhila Anand *\\"Adra Dolakku\\" ‚Äì Anthony Daasan, Jassie Gift *\\"Neramthaan Vandhathe\\" ‚Äì Abhay Jodhpurkar  Critical reception  The film received negative reviews from critics. Cinema Express wrote \\"The film tries to be a lot of things at the same time. It starts off as a murder mystery and quickly slips into the family-drama genre, while trying hard to be a comedy intermittently. This lack of clarity in the writing and the sloppy execution makes Pattinapakkam a hard film to sit through.\\" Times of India wrote \\"With hardly any convincing sequence, the whole set up looks staged and amateurish to the core.

It was the first passenger station in Blaenau Ffestiniog, then in Merionethshire, now in Gwynedd, Wales. This station is not to be confused with some miles distant on the Welsh Highland Railway; nor is it to be confused with the Festiniog and Blaenau Railway's northern terminus in the centre of Blaenau Ffestiniog which was sometimes referred to colloquially as \\"Dinas\\". Context The evolution of Blaenau's passenger stations was complex, with five different railway companies providing services to the area. Opening The station opened on 6 January 1865, carrying passengers to Portmadoc and points between. This was the first steam-hauled passenger service in Britain to use tracks of less than Standard Gauge, with the line carrying a quarter of a million people in its first year of operation. The station's first stationmaster was Mr John Lloyd, the initial service was five trains to and from Portmadoc each day except Sunday. Location The station was built among existing slate workings which had been rail-served for some years. The original route to the station and nearby workings was to be buried under slate waste from around 1900, but the railway still needed to access quarries near the former station, so a replacement branch was built from Glan-y-Pwll, allowing the original line to be buried. The station building was joined to Dinas engine shed which long outlived the station, finally closing in 1900, when it was replaced by a new building at Glan-y-Pwll. The original shed housed the railway's \\"Top Shunter\\", a locomotive long given to providing unofficial services to lineside dwellings. Closure In 1866 the FR opened Dinas Junction, from which its new \\"Branch Line\\" (the original line to Dinas being the \\"Main Line\\") ran to the new station nearer to the centre of the town. Trains from Portmadoc alternated between the two stations, but Duffws was better sited for passenger traffic, so Dinas closed in 1870. Slate traffic to the Dinas station area nevertheless continued well into the 20th Century. Modern times The station was eventually covered by slate waste, under which it is now completely buried.

He called \\"the new water he finds 'primary' water because of its close association with primary minerals.\\"Salzman, M.H., New Water for a Thirsty World; Science Foundation Press, Los Angeles: 1960, p. 42.

(1957): pp. 200-201. \\"Stephan Riess of California formulated a theory that \\"new water\\" which never existed before, is constantly being formed within the earth by the combination of elemental hydrogen and oxygen and that this water finds its way to the surface, and can be located and tapped, to constitute a steady and unfailing new supply.\\" Riess ultimately formulated the Theory of Primary Water and through the applied science of geo-hydrology, the study of surface waters of deep Earth origin, worked to end water scarcity globally. The book \\"New Water for a Thirsty World\\" by Michael Salzman was dedicated to him: Biography Born in 1898 to the Prussian Army officer Herman Franz Wolf Riess von Scheurnschloss and his wife (n√©e Koch) in Dillingen on the Danube, Kingdom of Bavaria (by that date part of the German Empire), he joined a \\"school ship\\" at the age of 14 to train to become a sailor. A few years later he served aboard a German Navy ship that was sunk during the 1916 Battle of Jutland in the North Sea. He was saved from the frigid sea by the British and became a prisoner of war. While a POW in England he began to learn English. After World War I he returned to Germany where he studied chemistry and metallurgy. Affected by the crisis of the post-war years of the Weimar Republic, Riess would travel to Australia and South America and ultimately the United States where he ended up in California working industrial mine concerns. During the late 1920s and early 1930s while working at mines throughout the American Southwest he experienced frequent flooding of mining operations by what seemed to him as inexplicable and sometimes immense flows of subterranean water.Hall, T.; Biography of Stephan Riess, unpublished obituary (1985). Riess began to study these phenomena as a new area of research. While working for Hoover Family interests in El Dorado Canyon south of Las Vegas, Nevada, where all water was piped great distance and elevation from the Colorado River, Riess worked with a crew to hand dig his first primary water well. When the source was struck, laborers scrambled from the pit to avoid drowning; eventually the free-flowing water created a lagoon until it was brought under control. Theory of primary water Steve Riess - Simi Valley As a mining engineer in the 1940s Riess had access to government and mining company assay laboratories. In order to investigate the problem of subterranean water, he began taking soil and rock samples from the failed mines and submitted them to chemical analysis. Riess thereby developed a body of test data leading to a previously undetected pattern. These waters, he noted: :*Emanated from below and surged upward, often to elevations far above the water table even in zones of no known aquifer with little precipitation, usually in hard rock :*Was chemically associated with Plutonic rock (which solidifies deep in the Earth where the cooling is slow and the various minerals have had time to crystallize) and not with any of the aggregate usually associated with meteoric water :*Traveled in a vertical or semi-vertical direction from the interior of the Earth toward the surface in hard rock faults or fissures By 1954, often together with drilling manager Jim Scott, Riess had sited and drilled 70 of these hard rock wells, usually located in distressed areas of little rainfall. In the midst of an extended drought in California, his work would come to the attention of news reporters, water resource bureaucrats, politicians, businessmen, farmers and industry leading to the publication of Salzman's book in 1960. By the late 1970s, he had drilled more than 800 wells that were supplied by what he regarded as primary water, and attracted a group of professionals who would launch The Riess Foundation and, in the 1980s, The Riess Institute to train the next generation of primary water specialists. Christopher Bird nominated Riess in 1982 for the Right Livelihood Award, considered the alternative Nobel Prize. The committee asked that his name be resubmitted in 1983. His legacy continues in the vision of the Primary Water Institute established by his protege and friend Pal Pauer. Reiss's theory received much publicity in the popular press during his life, and has become popular with dowsers.Christopher Bird, The Divining Hand (New York: Dutton, 1979) 147-177. His theory of primary water received very little support from John Mann Jr - a groundwater scientist in the 1950s.John F. Mann Jr., \\"Primary water - best selling fiction,\\" Water Well Journal, 1955: p.40-56. Riess' assertion that there are large volumes of potable primary water (what geologists now recognise as juvenile water) had been examined in the 1960s and rejected by hydrologists of the California Department of Water Resources and the US Geological Survey. Scientists from both organizations found no evidence that water pumped from Riess-located wells was anything but normal groundwater derived from downward-infiltrating precipitation.C. L. McGuiness, 1963, The Role of Ground Water in the National Water Situation, US Geological Survey, Water-Supply Paper 1800, p.18-21. The California Department of Water Resources compiled information on wells located by Riess, and of the 11 wells for which they had reliable information, yields varied from 0 to 90 gallons per minute, with an average of 19 gallons per minute artesian flow, with no data on the range of 500 to 3,000 gallons per minute pumping rate claimed by Riess for his wells.Harold B. Goldman, Ground Water, California Division of Mines and Geology, Mineral Information Service Aug. 1963, v.16 n.8. As of 2015 the United States Department of the Interior recognised Riess's Primary Water theories under the name juvenile water.https://www.usgs.gov/news/earthword-%E2%80%93-juvenile-water As a result of a series of field and laboratory experiments dating back 15 years‚Äîconducted primarily by seismologists, geochemists, mineralogists and geophysicists‚Äîthe theory that water is produced deep within the planet and is an addition to the hydrologic cycle has now been proven (2017): ‚ÄúThis is one way water can form on Earth,‚Äù says team member John Tse at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. ‚ÄúWe show it‚Äôs possible to have water forming in Earth‚Äôs natural environment, rather than being of extraterrestrial origin.‚Äù\\"Planet Earth makes its own water from scratch deep in the mantle\\" by Andy Coghlan in New Scientist (online), 27 January 2017: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2119475-planet-earth-makes-its-own-water- from-scratch-deep-in-the-mantle/ Criticism Riess's theory of primary water was criticized in mainstream geological and hydrological publications, including those of the US Geological Survey;‚ÄùC.

The existence of juvenile water has been commonly accepted by mainstream groundwater scientists, such as those of the US Geological Survey, since the 1920s.Oscar E. Meinzer, 1923, Outline of Ground-Water Hydrology, US Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper 494, p.31-32. The disagreement has been that juvenile water ‚Äì what Reiss called primary water, is considered by most groundwater scientists to be too highly mineralized to be potable.H. E. Thomas and D. E. White, ‚ÄúMeteoric vs nonmeteoric ground water,‚Äù Journal of the Irrigation and Drainage Division, American Society of Civil Engineers, June 1959, v.85 n.IR2 p.23-27. In a 1963 criticism of the Riess theory published by the US Geological Survey, C. L. McGuinness wrote: > There is no doubt that new water reaches the earth‚Äôs surface from the > interior. Geologists call it \\"juvenile water.\\" ‚Ä¶ It is invariably high in > mineral content, however;‚ÄùC. L. McGuinness, 1963, The Role of Ground Water > in the National Water Situation, US Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper > 1800, p.18. Geologists from the California Department of Water Resources investigated a number of wells cited by Reiss as examples of high-yield primary water wells. They reported that the actual flow rates were in most cases much lower than claimed by Riess. In addition, oxygen isotope analysis of the water identified it as of meteoric origin.Harold B. Goldman, ‚ÄúGround water,‚Äù California Division of Mines and Geology, Mineral Information Service, v.16 no.8. In an editorial \\"New nonsense for a thirsty world,\\" the Water Well Journal called attention to Reiss' failures at Alpine, Texas and Camp Desert Rock, Nevada. The editorial noted that the Riess-located well at Avalon, California, favorably mentioned by Salzman on page 51 of New Water for a Thirsty World, produced only 20 gallons per minute. It also noted that in discussing the supposed sale of Riess' Simi Valley wells to Clint Murchison for $1 million, Salzman failed to inform readers that Murchison paid Riess only $108,000 as a down payment, but after testing the wells and finding that they did not perform as Riess had promised, Murchison cancelled the deal.\\"New nonsense for a thirsty world,\\" Water Well Journal, February 1961, v.15 n.2 p,27.

Wilkinson's life and work is highlighted in the film Packed in a Trunk: The Lost Art of Edith Lake Wilkinson.  Early life and education  Wilkinson, the daughter of James P. Wilkinson and Lucy Lake Atkinson Wilkinson, was born August 23, 1868 in Wheeling, West Virginia. She moved to New York in 1888, studied at the Arts Student League of New York and earned a degree from Columbia Teacher‚Äôs College in 1905.  Later life and career as painter  Wilkinson spent extensive time in Provincetown from 1914 to 1923 as a member of the Provincetown Art Colony. She studied art with Charles Webster Hawthorne and Ambrose Webster, and was good friends with Blanche Lazzell. She also took up block printing, in particular a method known as the White-Line print, a technique started in 1915 by a group of artists who called themselves The Provincetown Printers. There are several white-line prints by Wilkinson that are signed and dated 1914, which pre-dates the earliest known prints by any of the others. On February 15, 1922, Edith's elderly parents were overcome by gas fumes in their Wheeling, West Virginia home. Edith's mother died from monoxide poisoning that day while her father was taken to a hospital and died the following day. Edith inherited an estate of approximately $35,000 (worth around $500,000 today) which was administered by local Wheeling attorney George J. Rogers. Years later, Rogers would be indicted for embezzling money from a number of his clients. He eventually declared bankruptcy, left the law profession and, by 1940, was working as a salesman for a household paper products company. While living in New York with her longtime female companion, Fannie Wilkinson of Augusta, Georgia, Edith received monthly checks from Rogers to cover her rent and daily living expenses. She had expressed an interest in moving back to Provincetown (an idea Rogers tried to discourage) and began studying French in anticipation of a possible trip to Paris. On March 22, 1924, Edith was admitted to the Sheppard Pratt Institution, an asylum for the mentally ill in Baltimore, Maryland in what was described as a \\"paranoid state\\". She was released on October 2 that same year, her condition having sufficiently improved. However, just five months later, on February 10, 1925, she was readmitted to Sheppard & Pratt where she remained for the next ten years. All of Wilkinson's possessions, including most of her artwork, were packed into trunks and shipped to her nephew, Edward Vossler, in Wheeling. In March 1935, Edith was transferred to Huntington State Hospital in West Virginia, still described as paranoid and now, at age 66, showing early signs of dementia. There she remained until her death on July 19, 1957. There is no evidence that she painted or did any artwork in the 30 years that she was institutionalized. In October 2013, Larkin Gallery in Provincetown, Massachusetts, hosted the return of Edith's work to Provincetown for the first time since her work was packed in a trunk and shipped to her family in the 1920's. None of the paintings or white line wood block prints was offered for sale; the event was simply a celebration of the return of this important artist's work to her beloved Provincetown, America's longest continuous artist's colony. Larkin Gallery Director, Stephen Briscoe, wrote at the time of the exhibit, \\" Edith, like so many others who have followed, came here to pursue a dream and, like so many since who, for whatever reason have chosen to leave or been forced to leave, has left a legacy that extends beyond tangible contributions. Edith‚Äôs return not only gives us the long withheld opportunity to see the world as she saw it nearly a century ago, it gives us something more. We‚Äôve gained a glimpse into history, not just of an artist who came to Provincetown with her life companion, women at the dawn of the new century, but of the plight of a woman whose control over her own destiny was forcibly taken from her. We‚Äôll never know what more we might have known of Edith‚Äôs work, of her vision, had her history continued along the line that she believed she was traveling. Instead we‚Äôll celebrate what has finally come home, at last, and hope that history will guide us to carefully and thoughtfully consider the future of this place that so many have cherished and been fortunate enough to have called home.\\" Decades later her life and art work was featured in a documentary, Packed in a Trunk: The Lost Art of Edith Lake Wilkinson. Today her work is in the collections of The Huntington Museum of Art as well as The Provincetown Art Association and Museum.

This station is not to be confused with the Festiniog and Blaenau Railway's (F&BR;) station which stood some distance away on the opposite side of Church Street. During that station's life from 1868 to 1883 passengers travelling from (say) on the F&BR; to on the Festiniog would walk between the two stations, much as passengers walk between the standard gauge and narrow gauge in modern-day Blaenau Ffestiniog. Context The evolution of Blaenau's passenger stations was complex, with five different railway companies providing services to the area. Station name Several sources comment on the name \\"Duffws\\", which is not a Welsh word but a corruption. What it is a corruption of is unclear, with some sources saying it comes from \\"Diffwys\\" (meaning 'steep slope or mountainside') - the pronunciation of both words is similar - others saying it is related to \\"Diphwys\\" and most making no comment. The station first appeared in Bradshaw on opening in January 1866 as \\"Diffwys\\", being changed to \\"Duffws\\" from 1867. Tickets largely used \\"Duffws\\", though an example bearing \\"Diphwys\\" is recorded. History Ffestiniog Railway engine \\"Welsh Pony\\" at Duffws (FR) station, 1886 The station opened in January 1866 for passengers to Portmadoc and points between. It joined the first steam-hauled passenger service in Britain to use tracks of less than standard gauge, with the line carrying a quarter of a million people in its first year of operation. The previous year the FR had opened station further from the centre of the town. Trains from Portmadoc alternated between the two stations, but Duffws was better sited for passenger traffic, so Dinas closed to passengers in 1870. Station layout The site and its buildings changed over the years. The initial station was built almost at a right angle to the running lines, with its tracks forming a very short branch adjacent to the north side of Church Street. In 1877 a new station building was erected northeast of the original, aligned with the running lines. Changes were made to tracks in later years, but the station building remains today. Both stations' platform was almost nominal, as the carriages were very low to the ground no height was needed. There were two running lines through the station: the \\"Passenger Line\\" which ran past the platform, with the other for goods and workmen's trains. The other two lines visible on photographs were a run-round loop for passenger locomotives and a siding. Closure The station closed throughout 1923-4, then closed for good in 1931, the last train having called the previous Autumn. The service was cut back to terminate at the joint GWR/FR station. Slate traffic continued past the station building. The FR closed progressively, the final axe falling in 1946, though quarries continued to use the line through the station to get ever-diminishing quantities of product to the exchange sidings at the LMS station. The station itself was eventually fenced off and its surrounds landscaped to become a car park. This process continued until 1962 with the eventual removal of all lines through the Duffws site when the quarries either closed or switched to using lorries to take slates to customers. Afterlife thumb By 2015 the station building had been converted to use as a public toilet. It had also been Grade 2 Listed.

It was commissioned by the Curtis Institute of Music for the pianist Gary Graffman. The work was first performed by Graffman and the Curtis Institute of Music Orchestra conducted by Andr√© Previn at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia, on February 4, 1993. Its New York City premiere was performed the next day by the same ensemble at Carnegie Hall. A then-unknown Hilary Hahn performed a solo violin section for both performances. Composition=Background The composer Ned Rorem and the pianist Gary Graffman first became acquainted as students at the Curtis Institute of Music. They were five years apart in age at the time and only later became close friends due to their mutual pianist friends Eugene Istomin and Julius Katchen. They remained friends for many decades since‚Äîwhich was furthered by Graffman's 1986 appointment as director of the Curtis Institute of Music, where Rorem had been on faculty for six years. Graffman, who had an ailment preventing the use of two fingers in his right hand, thus came to Rorem when the Institute decided to commission a new left-handed piano concerto. Before the premiere, Graffman commented, \\"I knew he would be just the right person to do this, and he did a terrific piece in eight movements. But when I saw it, I decided that it is really a piece for eight fingers, not five, because it is so difficult and jumps all over the place.\\" Structure The concerto has a duration of approximately 25 minutes and is cast in three numbered movements divided into eight subsections: Movement I. :1. Opening Passacaglia :2. Tarantella :3. Conversation Movement II. :4. Hymn :5. Duet :6. Vignette Movement III. :7. Medley :8. Closing Passacaglia Instrumentation The work is scored for a solo pianist (left hand only) and an orchestra comprising two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones, timpani, three percussionists, celesta, harp, and strings. Reception The concerto has been praised by music critics. A year after the world premiere, James R. Oestreich of The New York Times said the work \\"seems to grow in stature with each hearing.\\" John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune wrote, \\"The composer calls it an 'entertainment shaped like a suite,' an apt description for his unusual eight-movement design, which falls into the traditional fast-slow-fast pattern with a delicately lyrical section surrounded by sections of brilliant, spiky caprice.\\" He added, \\"This is inventive, accessible, cleverly scored, 'profoundly tonal' music (to use Rorem's words).\\" Recording The February 4, 1993 Carnegie Hall performance was commercially recorded and released by New World Records on March 14, 1994. The album also featured a recording of Rorem's Eleven Studies for Eleven Players.

Life and career Born in November 1871 to barrister Conway Edward Dobbs. Her father was Justice of the Peace for County Antrim, High Sheriff for Carrickfergus in 1875 and High Sheriff for County Louth in 1882. The family spent time living in Dublin where Dobbs was born. She attempted to learn Irish. However, when her father died in 1898 her mother moved the family back to Glenariff. Her mother was Sarah Mulholland, daughter of St Clair Kelvin Mulholland Eglantine, Co. Down. Dobbs was interested in learning Irish and found it easier to learn in Donegal where it was still spoken. Her first teacher was Hugh Flaitile. She attended the Irish College at Cloughaneely in the Donegal Gaeltacht. She brought the idea of promoting the language to the Glens of Antrim and her circle of friends. Dobbs was one of the small number of Protestant women interested in the Gaelic revival. 1904 saw the \\"Great Feis\\" in Antrim and Dobbs was a founder member of the Feis na nGleann committee and later a tireless literary secretary. In 1946, the Feis committee decided to honour her by presenting her with an illuminated address. It can be seen today at Portnagolan House with its stained glass windows commemorating a great Irishwoman. During her speech she said: ‚ÄòIreland is a closed book to those who do not know her language. No one can know Ireland properly until one knows the language. Her treasures are hidden as a book unopened. Open the book and learn to love your language‚Äô. Dobbs wrote seven plays, published by Dundalgan Press in 1920, though only three were performed. The Doctor and Mrs McAuley won the Warden trophy for one-act plays at the Belfast festival in 1913. However her plays were generally not a success and after 1920 she never wrote another. She continued to work on historical and archaeological studies and her articles were published in the Ulster Journal of Archaeology, in a German magazine for Celtic studies, in the French Revue Cletique and in the Irish magazine Eriu. Roger Casement was a good friend and although Dobbs never made her political opinions known she contributed to his defence costs when he was accused of treason. Although her political views were not clearly known Dobbs had been a member of the Gaelic League and in the executive of Cumann na mBan. She died in Portnagalon.

The metro plot was intended to become the first of a series attacks in Spain, Germany, France, Portugal and the United Kingdom as those countries contributed to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, with the timing determined by al Qaeda making political demands through Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud.  Arrests and indictment  Some 14 people ‚Äì twelve Pakistanis and two Indians ‚Äì were arrested between 18 and 19 January 2008 in the Raval multicultural neighborhood in Barcelona. The police searched four private homes, an industrial site turned into an Islamic prayer room and a bakery. One of the arrested cooperated with the intelligence services and became a protected witness. The police operation was authorized by Audiencia Nacional court after receiving information from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI). A number of books, pamphlets and other media containing radical Islamist ideas such as jihad and martyrdom were found by the Guardia Civil. Of the 14 detained, all were subjected to detention without contact to the outside world and transferred to Madrid. Two were released without charges on 22 January and two were released on 23 January and the remaining ten, of which nine Pakistanis and one Indian, were unconditionally provisionally imprisoned. On 14 March 2009, another member of the group who had left Barcelona before the police operation was arrested in Dutch city of Breda. Eight of the suspects, Maroof Ahmed Mirza, Mohammad Ayub Elahi Bibi, Mohamed Tarik, Qadeer Malik, Hafeez Ahmed, Roshan Jamal Khan, Shaib Iqbal and Imram Cheemawere were accused of being members of a terrorist organization and possessing explosives. The last three, Mohammed Shoaib, Mehmooh Khalid and Aqueel Ur Rahmnan Abassi, were only accused of belonging to a terrorist organization. The charges were upheld by the Audiencia Nacional in a 9 October 2009 trial. The judge concluded the constituted an organized group adhering to extremist Islamist ideology. Six of the sentenced were legal immigrants to Spain and most of those had lived in Spain since 2001. Five others arrived to Spain in the months prior to the plot. Months later, the Pakistani Taliban spokesman, claimed the attack in a video statement, which was posted on the Internet.

Recreational use of marijuana remains illegal in Minnesota.  History =Decriminalization In 1976, during a short-lived wave of decriminalization in the country, Minnesota reduced the penalty for possession for 42.5 grams or less to a petty misdemeanor. Medical marijuana The Minnesota Medical Marijuana Act creates a patient registry under the Department of Health relating to the therapeutic use of medical cannabis. It authorizes the use of medical cannabis in limited forms for certain qualifying medical conditions and regulates the distribution and manufacture of medical cannabis. It also creates a task force to conduct an impact assessment on medical cannabis therapeutic research and provides for certain criminal and civil protections for parties involved in the registry program. This passed the House 89‚Äì40 and the Senate 46‚Äì16. In May 2014 Governor Mark Dayton signed into law a bill legalizing marijuana for the treatment of nine severe medical conditions, including cancer, severe epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, glaucoma, Tourette's syndrome, ALS and Crohn's Disease. Registration for the program began on June 1, 2015, with actual distribution of medical marijuana beginning July 1, 2015. It is considered to be the most restrictive medical marijuana bill in the country, due to the limited number of medical conditions that qualify, and the forms of cannabis that are legal. To qualify for the program, patients must be diagnosed with one of the following conditions: Cancer (with pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or wasting), Glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, Tourettes, ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease), a seizure disorder, Multiple Sclerosis, Crohn's Disease, or a painful terminal illness with less than a year to live. For those individuals who meet the medical criteria, cannabis will only be legally available in liquid, pill or vaporized delivery method that does not require the use of dried leaves or plant form. In 2016, \\"intractable pain\\" was added to the list of qualifying conditions, with PTSD added August 1, 2017. Chronic pain and age-related macular degeneration were also added to the list of qualifying conditions on December 1, 2019; the changes will go into effect August 2020.  Responsible Adult Use Cannabis On November 6th, 2018, Tim Walz was elected to the Governorship. Walz argued that legalizing cannabis could bring in a new source of tax revenue if regulated properly, and it could reduce the number of people locked up for drug offenses: ‚ÄúI just think the time is here and we‚Äôre seeing it across the country. Minnesota has always been able to implement these things right.‚Äù On January 28th, 2019 Senator Melisa Franzen and Representative Mike Feiberg and Senator Scott Jensen introduced a bill that would allow people over 21 to possess, grow, and purchase limited quantities of cannabis. In a statement from Mike Feiberg ‚ÄúOur focus in drafting legislation to end the prohibition of cannabis in Minnesota is to ensure we have a responsible regulatory model for consumer access that still provides for public health, safety and welfare,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThe time has come for us to have this debate.‚Äù On March 8th, 2019, The Senate Republicans in Minnesota, voted down a measure to legalize the recreational use of cannabis. Republicans also decided not to create a task-force to study the issue further. Sen. Melisa Franzen, D-Edina, who sponsored the measure said ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a bill to move, so I think the debate is shut down in the Senate,\\" noting that Governor Tim Walz could convene a task force of his own but chose to not do so. Several proposals remain under consideration in the House, including the creation of a task force, similar to what Franzen proposed, and a constitutional amendment to let voters decide the fate of legalizing, taxing and regulating the recreational use of cannabis.

The valley is on the right bank of the Indus River, Pakistan's longest river, between Skardu and Giligit city. The valley is the biggest valley in term of area and population in Roundu subdivision. The valley has been one of the very important regions of the area in term of in history and of geological formation as well.  Geography  Stak Valley is situated in the middle of Skardu and Gilgit city on the right bank of the Indus River and Gilgit-Skardu Road. In the east of the Stak Valley lies the Askore valley and Thwar Valley. In the west are the Tooklano and Chamachoo. In the south there is Indus River and Ganji Valley just opposite to the Stak valley across the Indus river. In the north and northwest there is Haramosh and Kutia Glacier and likewise in the northeast the Goropha glacier. The prominent landmarks around the Stak valley are: Kutia Lungma Glacier, Goropha Glacier (which joins the Chogo Lungma Glacier), Haramosh Peak (7,397 m, 24,270 ft), Pharabar Peak (60,321 m 20,740 ft), Stak-La (Stak Mountain Pass 4,601 m, 15,491 ft) and some other peaks (Shinka, Mashika, Korang Kar) which are about 6,000 m (20,000 ft). The Stak River originates from the Stak-La and joins by Goropha, Kutia and Tooklano Streams and falls in Indus River after completing a course of about 30 km. The Stak River bisects the Stak Valley into two halves. One half starts from Rgialmokaza to Skangbudas and the other side starts from Khirzang to Tookla. Tookla is the last village of Stak, which is partly destroyed by a massive flood in 1999 which caused a huge destruction in the area, destroying the Gamba Tookla completely and Gongma Tookla partially. According to Geologists most of the villages are formed by the moraines, although the valley is one of the fertile valleys of the Roundu Subdivision.

Located on Church Street, it is an English Heritage hotel. It has recently been converted into a part of the Wetherspoons pub chain. It is famous for being mentioned in Charles Dickens' The Pickwick Papers. Location The pub is located on the A438, close to the River Avon and Tewkesbury Abbey. History Known originally as the Crown, The building, a well-known landmark of Tewkesbury is an amalgamation of a number of historic buildings dating from the 15th and 18th centuries, however, the pubs founding is listed as late 15th Century no confirmed date is known. It has been known by a number of names, including The Crown during Henry VIII's reign However, its current name 'the Royal Hop Pole' was acquired when in September 1891 (then) Princess Mary of Teck (Queen Mary Royal Consort of George V) visited the hotel, the royal crest still hangs over the entrance. The pub is mentioned in Charles Dickens' Pickwick Papers. It was purchased by J.D. Wetherspoon and re-opened in May 2008. During renovation work a former medieval banqueting hall was discovered in the structure. Today the building is still run as a hotel and has 28 bedrooms. Architecture The structure comprises two structurally separate buildings in its street front. The eastern half consisted of a three-storied, two-bay range jettied towards the street, with a contemporary hall wing to the north, the whole appearance of the later 15th century. The range to the street had a single large room on the ground and the first floor. The ground-floor room has exposed ceiling joists and was once lit by a range of two-light windows; it connects by a four-centred arched doorway with a wide side- passage, of which the original street doorway, with carved spandrels, moulded jambs, and brackets, is a larger version of similarly placed doorways in other houses of the town. The first-floor room was of some pretensions, having had two three-light windows with traceried heads and an oriel window, replaced in the 17th century, over the entrance to the side passage; the main ceiling beams have chamfered soffit-nibs. The second floor was once open to the roof, and the partition truss had shallow arch-braces to a collar-beam which had a central boss. The contemporary hall wing is of three bays; the floor area of the hall extended over all three, but the bay adjoining the range fronting the street had an upper story. The upper story was built above an elaborately moulded bressummer, supported by arched brackets, and there is a waist rail corresponding in height and in decorative detail in the east wall of the hall. A similarly enriched wallplate and cornice above indicate the quality of the hall. The former open truss has a deep arch-braced collar beam, with curved wind-braces to single purlins. A chimney-stack at the north end and an upper floor with richly moulded joists were inserted in the earlier 16th century. A two-storied wing adjoining the northwest corner of the hall wing and similarly aligned was built in the late 14th century. The upper rooms were open to the roof, which had a collar-purlin supported by crown-posts with four-way brackets. The cambered tie-beams are braced from principal posts in the side walls. An ovolo moulding cut from the solid runs from each face of the tie beams and along the upper edge of the wall plates. Riven lath filling in the internal trusses may represent an early division of the wing into separate lodgings.

He is best known for his co- discovery, along with Maria Kritzman, of enzymatic transamination and its dependence on vitamin B6. Braunstein and American scientist Esmond Snell have been cited as the \\"fathers of vitamin B6\\". Early life and education Braunstein was born in Kharkiv (then Kharkov), Ukraine in 1902. His father was an ophthalmologist. In his early education he displayed a facility for learning languages, became interested in studying chemistry, and eventually began study in medicine in 1920 at the Kharkov State Medical Institute. He then moved to Moscow and received his Ph.D. under the supervision of Vladimir Engelhardt in 1928. Academic career Braunstein spent his early scientific career at the People's Commissariat of Health. In 1936, he moved to the A. M. Gorky Institute of Experimental Medicine. In 1945, after the end of World War II, he assumed leadership of a laboratory at the Institute of Biological and Medical Chemistry, under the auspices of the then-new USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. In 1959, when his former Ph.D. advisor Engelhardt founded a new Institute of Radiation and Physico-Chemical Biology (later the Institute of Molecular Biology), Braunstein headed a laboratory there. Research Braunstein's best-known work centered on enzymatic transamination and the role of vitamin B6 (specifically, in its pyridoxal phosphate form) as a cofactor in these reactions. Along with Maria Kritzman, Braunstein co-discovered the phenomenon of transamination and described its biological significance in a series of papers beginning in 1937. Later, Braunstein's and Esmond Snell's research groups independently described a general catalytic mechanism for enzymes dependent on the biologically active form of vitamin B6, known as pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), as a cofactor. In his later career, Braunstein focused on X-ray crystallography, attempting to solve the structure of transaminase enzymes. After his death, Braunstein was recognized by colleagues for his scientific leadership. His skill with languages was remembered as facilitating international meetings throughout his career, at a time when English was less established as the common language of scientific discourse. As well as publishing in both Russian- and English-language scientific journals, Braunstein also translated scientific works.

It depicts a series of events that impact members of a Jewish family living in Washington, D.C., which some reviewers suggest includes autobiographical elements of Foer‚Äôs life. Here I Am is the first new novel published by Foer in over ten years, and it is the first in Foer's three-book installment with Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Plot Christian Lorentzen has described the plot as a blend of several different events, including \\"[a] divorce, a suicide, a bar mitzvah, an earthquake, an all-out Middle Eastern war, and the putting to sleep of a family dog\\". These plot elements are tied together through a central narrative about the ways in which these events impact the lives of a Jewish family living in Washington, D.C. Daniel Menaker notes that the \\"collage\\" of narratives overlap with one another at times, though they also sometimes conflict with each other. Jennifer Maloney has suggested that the novel contains several autobiographical elements. Constance Grady also cited similarities between Jacob Bloch, a character in the novel, and events in Foer's own life. When asked to describe the novel, author Jonathan Safran Foer said, \\"I would say it‚Äôs not my life but it‚Äôs me.\\" Background Here I Am is Foer's third novel, following Everything Is Illuminated (2002) and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2005). It is the first in Foer's three-book installment with publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The phrase \\"here I am\\" is derived from the biblical account of the words that were spoken by Abraham when he was asked to sacrifice his son, Isaac. Foer stated that he wrote two- thirds of Here I Am in the final year of his work on the novel. According to Time, Foer's work on the novel \\"went into high gear\\" after Foer decided to stop working on a planned television show for HBO called All Talk; the planned television show also would have focused on the life of a Jewish family in Washington, D.C. Foer explained that when he worked on the novel at his home, he would write on a laptop computer placed on his lap, and that he would move between rooms of his house whenever he began to experience \\"the inability to value [his] thoughts\\", an experience that Foer described as \\"Jonathan block\\".

Biography His father was a pharmacist and his mother came from a family of merchants. After taking a diploma at the Det von Westenske Institut, a private gymnasium, he began his artistic instruction at the drawing school operated by Frederik Ferdinand Helsted. In 1861, he took some classes at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, then attended the Modelskolen, but his studies were interrupted when he was conscripted to serve in the Second Schleswig War. He graduated from the Academy in 1866 and held his first exhibition that same year. From 1872 to 1878, he made several study trips to Italy and France; notably a trip to Paris from 1875 to 1876. Later in 1876, when the highly-respected painter, Vilhelm Kyhn, rejected the desirability of seeking inspiration from the French, Groth strongly disagreed. He wrote Dansk Kunst i Forhold til Udlandets (1876), providing a new approach to historical awareness of past influences. Inspired by the work of Georg Brandes, he argued that every period imposes its own requirements and that Realism was the appropriate goal for contemporary Danish artists. This led him to associate with the \\"\\" (roughly, the \\"Literalists\\") a group of radical intellectuals who between 1880-1882 met to discuss art and literature . Karl Gjellerup and Pietro Krohn were among its most notable members. His best works are generally believed to be those he did along the shores of Lilleb√¶lt and Helleb√¶k. In 1874, his painting Hede med en Mose was acquired for the Royal Collection.  Selected Paintings  File:Vilhelm Groth - To sm√•piger i skoven en efter√•rsdag.jpgTwo Young Girls in the Autumn Woods.

This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Isaiah, and is one of the Books of the Prophets. Chapters 40-55 are known as \\"Deutero-Isaiah\\" and date from the time of the Israelites' exile in Babylon. This chapter includes the third of the songs of the \\"Suffering Servant\\".  Text  The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 11 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (3rd century BC or later): * 1QIsa (2nd century BCE): all verses *1QIsa (1st century BCE): extant: verses 8‚Äì11 * 4QIsac (4Q57): extant verses 7‚Äì11 There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century), and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\\\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). Parashot The parashah sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.As implemented in the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 edition of the Hebrew Bible in English.

Similarly in : :The sun became black as sackcloth of hair. Third servant song The servant songs were first identified by Bernhard Duhm in his 1892 Commentary on Isaiah. The songs are four poems taken from the Book of Isaiah written about a certain \\"servant of YHWH\\". God calls the servant to lead the nations, but the servant is horribly repressed. In the end, he is rewarded. Those four poems are: # # # # Isaiah 52-53 The third of the \\"servant songs\\" begins at Isaiah 50:4, continuing through 50:11. The Jerusalem Bible divides it into two sections: *Isaiah 50:4-9: The servant speaks *Isaiah 50:10-11: Exhortation to follow the servant.Jerusalem Bible (1966), Isaiah 50:4-11 This song has a darker yet more confident tone than the others. Although the song gives a first-person description of how the Servant was beaten and abused, here the Servant is described both as teacher and learner who follows the path God places him on without pulling back. Echoing the words of the first song, \\"a bruised reed he will not break\\", he sustains the weary with a word. His vindication is left in God's hands. Almost all commentators agree that the language here is individual in nature.The Book of Isaiah: Chapters 40-66, by John N. Oswalt, W.B.

Layer I is mostly destroyed, which is attributed to its proximity to the surface. Some kilns and building remains have been found. The houses of layer II appear to have been built of wood and mudbrick on the ruins of Layer III in a hurry, according to Nimet √ñzg√ºc. Layer III itself was heavily damaged by fire, but appears to have represented the period of greatest prosperity for the site. Layers IV and V are unexplored, or at least unpublished, but presumably belong to the pre-Karum period. In 2016 new research using carbondating and dendrology on timber used in this site and the palace in K√ºltepe show the felling dates for primary construction of the Sarƒ±kaya Palace at Acemh√∂y√ºk are placed at RY730-731 on the MBA chronology. RY732 equates with 1793‚Äì1784 BCE (68.2% hpd; the 95.4% hpd is 1797‚Äì1781 BCE). This research shows that middle or low-middle chronology are the only remaining possible chronologies that fit these new data.  Research history Excavation of Acemh√∂y√ºk began in 1962 under the General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums in conjunction with the University of Ankara. From 1962 to 1988, Nimet √ñzg√º√ß led the excavations. Since 1989, the project has been led by Aliye √ñztan. Some the finds are on display in the Aksaray Museum; others are displayed at the Niƒüde Archaeological Museum.  History No narrative history of Acemh√∂y√ºk can be written. Layers IV and V belong to the period before the Assyrians established karum settlements in central Anatolia. Layer III belongs to the karum period and represents the height of the settlement's prosperity, but it was destroyed by fire. The cause of this fire cannot be determined. Settlement on the hill ceased after this until it was resettled in the Hellenistic or Roman period.  Architecture = The Sarikaya-Palace  There is a palace building on the citadel. The western part of the palace has been completely destroyed by later settlement and modern activity. The 1.5-2 metre thick walls are still p to 3.8 metres high in places. The palace must have contained around 50 rooms (the exact number is uncertain due to the subsequent destruction). The northern, eastern and western sides were surrounded by a portico, made of marble bases and wooden pillars. The ground floor of the building was used for storage purposes. Clay bullae were found in all the rooms. It is assumed that the rooms of the officials were on the upper floor, as at K√ºltepe.  Clay Bullae  The clay bullae in the Sarikaya Palace included sealings of Shamshi- Adad I, Dugedu (a daughter of Yahdun-Lim of Mari) and King Aplahanda of Carchemish.  Inscription Inscription on a sealing of Shamshi-Adad: ::dUTUsi dIskur ::Sakin dEnlil ::≈†am≈°i-Adad Appointee of the god Enlil  Pratt Ivories  Four ivory sphinxes from Acemh√∂y√ºk, Turkey. Pratt ivories, Metropolitan Museum of Art Between 1932 and 1937, a group of 2nd millennium B.C. ivory furniture fittings were donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by the collector George D. Pratt. Subsequent scholarship has shown that several of these pieces originally formed part of an elaborate gold and ivory throne, which has been convincingly reconstructed by Elizabeth Simpson. In the 1960s, archaeological excavations of the Sarikaya Palace revealed stylistically similar ivory pieces, including a wing that matched with a falcon in the Pratt collection. Rumors of looting from the site and photographs of the ivories from a nearby dealer have further demonstrated that the pieces originally came from Acemh√∂y√ºk, where they were looted and eventually sold on the antiquities market. Since their acquisition by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, they have become known as the Pratt Ivories or the Acemh√∂y√ºk ivories.

Plot The fictional film is set during Pondicherry's independence from France in 1954. It tells the story of Stanislas Charvin, a young European male born in India but raised in Marseilles, France by his grandmother. Stanislas returns to Pondicherry as the French administration are preparing to leave; he intends to collect his mother‚Äôs remains for repatriation to France for burial. While in India, he learns that his mother has not died but has disappeared. Stanislas discovers that she left her husband Andr√© for Weber, a half-caste man, and is consequently shunned and despised by her community. During the course of the film, Stanislas meets his father (whom he hates) but reconciles with him before his death. The film explores the self-discovery of the young 20 year-old Stanislas against the backdrop of the \\"great departure\\" as we see several images of boxes and suitcases in the background. The final message to appear before the credits roll makes an explicit connection between the loss of the \\"comptoirs\\" in India and the Algerian War: ‚ÄúNovember 1st, 1954, Pondicherry rejoins India as the Algerian insurrection explodes‚Äù.

Caracterizaci√≥n de los sitios arqueol√≥gicos Sabana de Bogot√° - ICANH The rock shelter is located in the municipality Tocancip√°, Cundinamarca, Colombia, in the northern part of the Bogot√° savanna. At Tibit√≥, bone and stone tools (knives and scrapers mostly) and carbon have been found. Bones from Haplomastodon, Cuvieronius, Cerdocyon and white tailed deer from the deepest human trace containing layer of the site is carbon dated to be 11,740 ¬± 110 years old. The oldest dated sediments are lacustrine clays from an ancient Pleistocene lake. Principal research at Tibit√≥ was carried out by Colombian archaeologist Gonzalo Correal Urrego, who also analysed other early sites Tequendama, Aguazuque and El Abra.Correal Urrego, 1990  Background  The Altiplano Cundiboyacense, and its southeastern flat portion the Bogot√° savanna, were populated by the first humans in the late Pleistocene, as evidenced by finds in Pubenza (16,000 years BP), El Abra, Tibit√≥ and others. Until roughly 30,000 years BP, the Bogot√° savanna was covered by a large lake; Lake Humboldt. This glacial lake surrounded by snowy peaks was fed by the glaciers of Sumapaz in the south, based on analysis of debris flow deposits close to Fusagasug√°, yielding ages between 40,000 and 7000 years BP.Hoyos et al., 2015, p.265 The approximately large lake contained an island, presently known as the Suba Hills (Cerros de Suba), in Bogot√°. Surrounding the lake, Pleistocene megafauna as Glyptodonts, giant sloths, mastodons and deer foraged. The lake retreated during the last 30,000 years, but remnants still existing today are the Bogot√° River and its tributaries, Lake Herrera and the many Wetlands of Bogot√°. The timber line around Lake Humboldt, in older texts named Lake Bogot√°, has been estimated to have been lower than today.Zonneveld, 1968, p.205 During the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene, the first humans arrived on the Andean high plateau at above sea level. They settled in caves and rock shelters in various locations on the Altiplano and had a hunter- gatherer lifestyle. The main ingredient of the early diet existing until colonial times was white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Fishing in the many lakes that existed in those times was another source of food for the people.  Description  When the first human settlers arrived at Tibit√≥, mastodons were still extant and served as food and bone tool source for the people Radiocarbon dating of a deeper lacustrine clay in the sequence of Tibit√≥ revealed the site was in a lake environment around 52,000 years BP.Vogel & Lerman, 1969, p.358 Pleistocene lakes also existed in the Ubat√©- Chiquinquir√° Valley to the northwest and in the valley of Soat√°, in the lower altitude northeasternmost part of the Muisca Confederation.Villarroel et al., 2001, p.79 The paleoclimate changed over the course of the latest Pleistocene and the Upper Pleniglacial was relatively humid, eroding earlier lagunal clays. The latest stage of the Pleniglacial was characterised by a cold and dry climate. In the valleys, hunter-gatherers lived. The original topography was covered in the Guantiv√° interstadial and El Abra stadial by humic sediments.Scott & Meyers, 1994, p.390 At Tibit√≥ remains of the extinct Pleistocene megafauna Cuvieronius, Haplomastodon and Equus amerhippus and extant white tailed deer and crab-eating fox have been found set in a circle. The bones were burnt and unburnt and mixed with stone artifacts and limestone chunks. The most important finds of Cuvieronius come from the Eastern Cordillera, with main sites Tibit√≥ and Mosquera.Prado et al., 2003, p.353 156 unifacial stone artifacts, of which 41% knives, pieces of carbon and bone tools have been found and analysed by Gonzalo Correal Urrego.Dillehay, 1999, p.208Correal Urrego, 1990, p.74 Ninetynine percent of the finds were from local origin.Gnecco & Aceituno, 2004, p.155 The bones, showing a relative higher abundance of Haplomastodon than Cuvieronius and the extinct American horse,Correal Urrego, 1990, p.76 have been carbon dated to be 11,740 ¬± 110 years old. This was confirmed by palynological analysis, that also indicated a p√°ramo climate at the time.Correal Urrego, 1990, p.77 This makes the site slightly younger than the oldest; El Abra, dated at 12,400 ¬± 160 years BP.

The site is located north of the town centre.G√≥mez Mej√≠a, 2012, p.146 At Checua, thousands of stone and bone tools, stone flakes and human remains have been found, indicating human occupation from around 8500 to 3000 years BP. Main archaeologist for Checua is Ana Mar√≠a Groot, who published the results of her research in 1992.Groot de Mahecha, 1992  Background  The Altiplano Cundiboyacense has been inhabited at least since 12,500 years ago. The first human settlers migrated via the Darien Gap from Central America to South America and led a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. They populated the rock shelters of the high plateau in the Andes, then still with abundant Pleistocene megafauna as Cuvieronius, Haplomastodon, Equus amerhippus and giant sloths. During this preceramic phase, the population shifted from rock shelters to open area settlement, of which Galindo and Checua are among the oldest. A later site in Soacha, Cundinamarca; Aguazuque is comparable to Checua. During the second millennium before present, the population increased and settlements became bigger. This is evidenced in the findings at the salt mine of Nemoc√≥n.Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.7  Description  The landscape around Nemoc√≥n is hilly with flat valleys. Checua is an open area settlement, located north of the urban centre  Geology  Checua is located in a valley of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense and its geology is determined by the Andean orogeny. Checua lies in the middle of a rich halite area, with salt mines in Nemoc√≥n, Zipaquir√° and Tausa surrounding the site. The sedimentary sequence consists of the oldest outcropping units of the Villeta Group of Early Cretaceous age. This sequence is followed by the sandstone formations of the Guadalupe Group, Late Cretaceous in age. Overlying the Mesozoic section is the Maastrichtian to Paleocene Guaduas Formation. Due to the Andean tectonic movements, most of the Tertiary section is eroded or non-deposited and the Guaduas Formation is overlain by the Pleistocene Sabana Formation.Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.11  Climate  The climate of the area around Checua is constant throughout the year with an average maximum temperature of and an average minimum of . The yearly precipitation varies from to , mostly in short erosional showers. The winds can be strong and aid the erosive process of the water.Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.12  Vegetation  The vegetation was of a lower altitude dry forest type with native species Dodanae viscosa, Baccharis sp., Prunus capuli, Xilosma speculiferum, Duratana mutissi, Lupinus sp., dividivi (Tara spinosa), Solanum sp., Hesperolemes heterophyla and fique (Agave sp.).Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.13  Stone tools  Lithic scraper tool The Checua site has been divided into nine stratigraphical units of sands and clays.Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.17 More than 1750 lithic tools have been found in the units, with a highest frequency in units 4 and 5b. They mostly consist of scrapers and knives. Furthermore, 2820 stone flakes, interpreted as materials to build tools have been discovered, with a highest frequency in unit 8.Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.28  Bone tools  Various bone tools have been found in Checua. The type is very similar to those found at Aguazuque and Tequendama. Apart from tools, also a musical instrument made from bone has been uncovered. This bone flute was discovered in stratigraphic unit 5b at a depth of .Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.56  Tooth enamel  Dating of the tooth enamel of one of the remains, using Electronic Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), provided an age of 7850 ¬± 190 years BP.Sandoval & Almanza, 2012, p.251 Using the same method, in 2014 another tooth enamel was analysed, providing an age of 5021 ¬± 202 years BP.Carvajal et al., 2014, p.128  Human occupation phases  As at Tequendama and Aguazuque, abundant remains of the domesticated guinea pig have been found at Checua Analysis of the various stratigraphic levels and the tools found, led to the identification of four zones of human occupation within a total time span of 5500 years (6500‚Äì1000 years BCE).Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.61 The first zone, dated to about 8500 to 8200 years BP, contains mostly scrapers and perforators used for the elaboration of meat and animal skins. The second zone of occupation, lasting from about 8200 to 7800 years BP, consists of various burial sites.Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.64-77 Here, also scrapers and perforators were found, together with the main ingredients of the diet of the people; white tailed deer and guinea pig.Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.66 In this zone, the bone flute has been unearthed.Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.76 The third level corresponds to the seventh stratigraphical unit where many bone fragments were found. The unit has been compared to Aguazuque for dating at around 5000 years BP, possibly lasting till 4000 years BP.Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.80 As is the case with Aguazuque, the fourth and uppermost zone has been disturbed by modern agricultural activities and the presence of glass indicates contamination with postcolonial influence. A top age for the sequence has not been provided, but an occupation until 3000 years BP is suggested.Groot de Mahecha, 1992, p.83  See also  *List of Muisca and pre-Muisca sites *Aguazuque, Tequendama, Tibit√≥, Nemoc√≥n *El Abra, Ana Mar√≠a Groot  References = Bibliography   *  Further reading  * * Category:Former populated places in Colombia Category:Tourist attractions in Cundinamarca Department Category:Muisca and pre-Muisca sites Category:Altiplano Cundiboyacense Category:Andean preceramic Category:Archaeological sites in Colombia ","title":"Checua"},{"id":"52184850","title":"List of Muisca and pre-Muisca sites"},{"id":"52184918","text":"Kea is an open-source DHCP server developed by the Internet Systems Consortium, authors of ISC DHCP, also known as DHCPd.

Chapters 40-55 are known as \\"Deutero-Isaiah\\" and date from the time of the Israelites' exile in Babylon. This chapter includes the second of the songs of the \\"Suffering Servant\\".  Text  The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 26 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008).

God calls the servant to lead the nations, but the servant is horribly repressed. In the end, he is rewarded. Those four poems are: # # # # Isaiah 52-53 The second of the \\"servant songs\\" begins at Isaiah 49:1, continuing through 49:12. This poem, written from the Servant's point of view, is an account of his pre-natal calling by God to lead both Israel and the nations. The Servant is now portrayed as the prophet of the Lord equipped and called to restore the nation to God. Yet, anticipating the fourth song, he is without success. Taken with the picture of the Servant in the first song, his success will come not by political or military action, but by becoming a light to the Gentiles. Ultimately his victory is in God's hands.

It protects the area of the War of Canudos, where peasants of mixed blood were massacred by Republican soldiers in 1896‚Äì97. Location The Canudos State Park is in the municipality of Canudos, Bahia, and has an area of . It is about from the state capital of Salvador. The park entrance is reached from highway BR-235 by a paved road. From the highest point there is a panorama of the Cocorob√≥ Dam. History The present town of Canudos is the third of that name. The first was destroyed by the army. The inhabitants rebuilt a town on the ruins, but it was destroyed by the Cocorob√≥ Dam, built by the military regime in the 1960s with the dual purpose of providing water for the region and erasing history. The vacant land was acquired by decree 33.193 of 27 May 1986, and the Canudos State Park was established by decree 33.333 of 30 June 1986. The decree authorized the Department of Education and Culture, through the Bahia State University (UNEB), to adopt the measures necessary for the park's construction. The stated purpose of the park is to make it impossible to forget the martyrs led by Ant√¥nio Conselheiro. Environment The area is dry and hot all year. Vegetation is caatinga, characterized by species with few leaves and many thorns, particularly cacti and bromeliads. When it rains the empty riverbeds suddenly fill with water but are sometimes dry again a few hours later, leaving pools where the animals drink. The Vaza-Barris River was like this until the Cocorob√≥ Dam was built. This was the difficult environment where Conselheiro and his followers lived. Intensive research carried out by the Canudos Project, co-funded by UNEB and the Funda√ß√£o de Amparo √† Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia (FAPESB), found about 120 species of plants native to the caatinga biome. The majority of plants were pau-de-rato (Caesalpinia pyramidalis). UNEB and the Companhia Hidrel√©trica do S√£o Francisco (CHESF) have planted about 1,000 seedlings of native plants, and plan to plant over 10,000 seedlings. Exhibits The Canudos State Park is in the area where the War of Canudos was fought, and has valuable historical, archaeological and anthropological sites, serving as an open air museum. It is structured to support historical tourism and research, with a photographic exhibition, relics, maps and signs. The park has a trail that leads past strategic points associated with the bloody 19th century battles. Signs describe the sites of military camps, hospitals, cemeteries of the soldiers and of Ant√¥nio Conselheiro's followers, and trenches occupied by the combatants. The park includes the Vale da Morte, where the soldiers buried their dead, the Vale da Degola and the Alto do Maio, where the commander of the third expedition Colonel Ant√¥nio Moreira C√©sar (1850‚Äì97) died. The graves in the Vale da Morte are shallow, and erosion uncovers the bones. Although measures have been taken to protect the sites, the ground is littered with old rifle bullets, shrapnel and pieces of pottery, which are vulnerable to tourists looking for souvenirs. A photographic exhibition has glass panels up to high with photographs of the war and its aftermath, as well as the map of the region and engravings of the country.

Transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1942, the minesweeper saw service on both the West and East Coasts of Canada as a convoy escort and patrol vessel. In 1944, Bayfield sailed for European waters and took part in the invasion of Normandy. She remained in European waters for the rest of the war and was returned to the United Kingdom in September 1945. The minesweeper was laid up until being discarded for scrap in 1948. Design and description A British design, the Bangor-class minesweepers were smaller than the preceding s in British service, but larger than the in Canadian service.Chesneau, p. 64Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 177 They came in two versions powered by different engines; those with a diesel engines and those with vertical triple-expansion steam engines. Bayfield was of the latter design and was larger than her diesel-engined cousins. Bayfield was long overall, had a beam of and a draught of . The minesweeper had a displacement of . She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted. Bayfield had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. British Bangor-class minesweepers were armed with a single 12-pounder () 12 cwt HA gun mounted forward. For anti- aircraft purposes, the minesweepers were equipped with one QF 2-pounder Mark VIII and two single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns.Macpherson (1997), p. 38 The 2-pounder gun was later replaced with a twin 20 mm Oerlikon mount. As a convoy escort, Bayfield was deployed with 40 depth charges launched from two depth charge throwers and four chutes. Operational history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the British 1940 construction programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 30 December 1940 by North Vancouver Ship Repairs at their yard in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Named for a community in Nova Scotia, Bayfield was launched on 26 May 1941. Transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy, the ship was commissioned on 26 February 1942. Following work ups, the minesweeper joined Esquimalt Force in May 1942, the local patrol and convoy escort force operating out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. Bayfield was one of the warships added to the west coast patrol force after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The main duty of Bangor-class minesweepers after commissioning on the West Coast was to perform the Western Patrol. This consisted of patrolling the west coast of Vancouver Island, inspecting inlets and sounds and past the Scott Islands to Gordon Channel at the entrance to the Queen Charlotte Strait and back.Douglas et al., No Higher Purpose, p. 349 Bayfield transferred to Prince Rupert Force, the local patrol and convoy escort force operating out of Prince Rupert, British Columbia in November. In March 1943, Bayfield was reassigned to the East Coast of Canada, arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 30 April 1943. The minesweeper was then sent to Baltimore, Maryland in the United States to undergo a refit. Following the refit, Bayfield returned to Canada to join Halifax Force, the local patrol and escort force operating out of Halifax. In February 1944, Bayfield sailed for European waters as part of Canada's contribution to the invasion of Normandy. After arriving at Plymouth on 7 March, the minesweeper was assigned to the all-Canadian 31st Minesweeping Flotilla.Schull, p. 233 The 31st Minesweeping Flotilla was assigned to the assault sweep during the landings on 6 June and cleared channel 3 in the American sector.Schull, p. 267 During the sweep, Bayfield served as a danlayer, marking the swept channel.Schull, p. 270 The minesweepers completed their work unmolested by the Germans ashore.Schull, p. 272 Following D-day operations, the minesweeper remained in European waters assigned to Plymouth Command until being paid off on 24 September 1945 before being transferred back to the United Kingdom. Bayfield was laid up in reserve at Sheerness until 1948. The minesweeper was sold on 1 January 1948 and broken up by King at Gateshead.Colledge, p. 78 References=NotesCitationsSources   External links * * Category:Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Bangor-class minesweepers of the Royal Navy Category:Ships built in British Columbia Category:1941 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of the United Kingdom Category:Bangor-class minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy ","title":"HMCS Bayfield"},{"id":"52185040","text":"Bellville is an unincorporated community in Marion County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.

In mixology, oleo saccharum can be used to sweeten beverages by their direct use or as an ingredient in flavored syrups. Oleo saccharum is a key component in many punch recipes, being listed as an ingredient as early as 1670. On a microscopic level, sugar extracts oils from fruit rinds gradually though osmosis, however, oil extraction is greatly accelerated through muddling or mechanical abrasion of the mixture, which helps to rupture oil-rich vacuoles on the rinds' surface or flavedo.

Unlike her contemporaries, she taught English and later wrote in English. One of the most well-known of the Shanghai School (haipai) writing style, Cheng revived the literary legacy of the elites who had been rejected during the Cultural Revolution. She won numerous awards for her novels and short stories before embarking on a series of non-fiction works telling the history of \\"Old Shanghai\\". Early life Cheng Naishan was born in 1946 in Shanghai, China, to Pan Zuojun () and the eldest son of the Cheng family. Her grandfather was Cheng Muhao (), noted banker of the Qing dynasty bank who served as Deputy Director of the Bank of China in Kobe, Japan, treasurer and Deputy Manager of the Bank of China in Shanghai, Inspector of China Insurance Company and as the General Manager of the Bank of China in Hong Kong. When she was two years old, her family moved to Hong Kong, where she began her elementary education. She first studied at St. Mary's English School, but after two years, her father withdrew her and enrolled Cheng and her older brother in the elementary school attached to the communist-run Xiangdao Middle School. After completing the fourth grade, Cheng's family returned to Shanghai to manage the family business interests there. During her high school years, she loved watching films and became interested in how plots were developed. She was also encouraged to read and study by her parents. Her mother had been an aspiring writer, before the revolution. She completed high school in 1964 and as the Great Leap Forward had ended previously, she was not sent to work in the fields. She then attended Shanghai Teachers Training College graduating with a degree in English in 1965. Though her grandfather had helped the communist underground at the time of the revolution, during the Cultural Revolution (1966 until 1976), Cheng's family was persecuted because of their intellectual, bourgeois background and though they wanted to leave, they were aware it was too dangerous to even apply. Family heirlooms and treasures, like photographs and jewelry, were confiscated and lost or destroyed. and her mother was sent to a mental facility several times. Career After completing her education, Cheng taught English at a Huimin Middle School () in Shanghai until 1979. In that year, she published her first novel, Songs My Mother Taught Me (Mama jiao chang de ge) in the magazine Shanghai Literature. She had originally written the work after the Gang of Four were convicted, wanting to tell the story of her mother's tragedy. Filling two exercise books with her scribblings, Cheng asked friends to read them and give their opinion. They were moved by the work and encouraged her to submit it to the editorial department of Shanghai Literature. When the story was accepted, if she would allow it to be edited, Cheng was encouraged to quit her teaching job and pursue a career in writing. That work was followed by a collection of short stories, Death of a Swan, published in 1982. In 1985, she joined the Chinese Writers Association and that same year began working at their Shanghai branch as a professional writer and won the National Best Novella award for her story, Daughter‚Äôs Tribulations (N√ºer jing, , 1985). Cheng explored topics that were rarely dealt with by her contemporary writers. She wrote about upper-class urban life, while her peers predominantly wrote about peasants, soldiers and workers. Intellectuals, with university education, wanted to participate in the development of China, but they were not allowed to do so. One of the reasons Cheng wrote about them was to recover the story of the generation lost between the national entrepreneurs at the end of the Republican era and the beginning of the communist era. She also wrote themes exploring her Christianity, casting religion, in the mostly-atheist literary tradition, in a sympathetic light. Rather than directly writing about religion, Cheng demonstrated beliefs in the actions of her characters. In addition to writing her own stories, Cheng translated the works of other writers including a translation with her mother of Nien Cheng's Life and Death in Shanghai (1987) and Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club (1989). Cheng wrote over seventy novels and novellas, nearly a dozen of which have been translated into English, Esperanto, French, German and Japanese. The Daughter‚Äôs Tribulations was adapted for film and four other works were presented as television dramas. Her most known work, The Blue House (1983) was based upon relationships of people she had known in her past. A son who rejected his father because the father tried to force him into an arranged marriage and a relative of her husband's whose complicated relationships between his wife, his concubine and the sons of both women give glimpses into the cultural elites' lives during politically changing times. It examines family relationships, rehabilitation and inheritance. The book won the \\"Zhong Shan\\" Literary Award. Her work The Poor Street (1989), also featured as a television adaptation, was a break from previous works, presenting a view of the blue collar and lower class life in Shanghai's diverse population. Her book The Bankers (1989) covered three generations (her grandfather's, her parents' and her own) of Chinese history and life in Shanghai and is the fictionalized tale of her own grandfather's life. In the 1990s, Cheng was able to use her Hong Kong citizenship to relocate there. She later traveled back and forth between Shanghai and Hong Kong, dividing her time between the cities for a decade before returning to Shanghai. Around the same time, Cheng wrote and published a series of non- fiction works, including Shanghai Tango (Shanghai tan'ge, , 2002), Shanghai Lady (Shanghai n√ºren, , 2004), Shanghai Fashion (Shanghai shizhuang, , 2005), Shanghai Romance (Shanghai langmanshi, , 2006) and Shanghai Saxophone (Shanghai sakesifeng, , 2007), which focused history of Shanghai. The illustrated books highlighted significant areas of the city's culture and were inspired when she realized that her grandchildren did not understand the history of their own city. She began collecting stories about various aspects of the city from old-timers, researching everything from the architecture to the people and legends of the city, \\"Old Shanghai\\", before the revolution. Death and legacy Cheng died in Shanghai on 22 April 2013 after battling leukemia. Cheng's monumental work on documenting the history of Old Shanghai, though interrupted by her death, preserved a unique part of China's history.

A contingent election for the President is decided by a vote of the United States House of Representatives, while a contingent election for the Vice President is decided by a vote of the United States Senate. During a contingent election, each House state delegation casts one vote to determine the president, rather than a vote from each representative. Senators instead cast votes individually for vice president. The contingent election process was first established in Article Two, Section 1, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution. It was subsequently modified by the 12th Amendment in 1804. The phrase \\"contingent election\\" is not found in the text of the Constitution itself, but has been used to describe this procedure since at least 1823. Contingent elections have occurred only three times in American history: in 1801, 1825, and 1837. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, the presidential and vice-presidential nominees on the ticket of the Democratic- Republican party, received the same number of electoral votes. Under the procedures in place at the time, this necessitated a contingent election the following year to decide which would be President and which Vice President. In 1824, the Electoral College was split between four candidates, with Andrew Jackson losing the subsequent contingent election to John Quincy Adams, despite having won a plurality of both the popular and electoral vote. In 1836, faithless electors in Virginia refused to vote for Martin Van Buren's vice-presidential nominee Richard Mentor Johnson, denying him a majority of the electoral vote and forcing the Senate to elect him in a contingent election. All three contingent elections in the nineteenth century were held by the outgoing Congress, since, at the time, congressional terms ended/began on the same day as presidential terms. In 1933, the 20th Amendment stipulated that the term of the incoming congress should start before that of the incoming President, and that it should be the incoming congress which would choose the President in any future contingent election.  Electoral College overview  In the United States, the president and vice president are indirectly elected (by the Electoral College, which, since ratification of the 23rd Amendment in 1961, consists of 538 presidential electors from the 50 states and the District of Columbia). Presidential electors themselves are directly elected on a state-by-state basis. Since the election of 1824, a majority of the states have chosen their electors on a statewide winner-take- all basis, based on the statewide popular vote on Election Day. Maine and Nebraska are the only two current exceptions, as both states use the congressional district method. Although ballots list the names of the presidential and vice presidential candidates (who run on a ticket), voters actually choose electors when they vote for president and vice president. These presidential electors in turn cast electoral votes for those two offices. Electors usually pledge to vote for their party's nominee, but some \\"faithless electors\\" have voted for other candidates. A candidate must receive an absolute majority of electoral votes (currently 270) to win the presidency or the vice presidency. If no candidate receives a majority in the election for president or vice president, that election is determined via a contingency procedure established by the 12th Amendment. In such a situation, the House chooses one of the top three presidential electoral vote-winners as the president, while the Senate chooses one of the top two vice presidential electoral vote-winners as vice president. The contingent election process was modified by the 20th Amendment, which took effect in 1933. The amendment greatly reduces the length of lame-duck sessions of Congress. As a result, the lame-duck Congress no longer conducts contingent elections, with the newly- elected Congress instead conducting contingent elections. For example, if a contingent election had been held to determine the outcome of the 1936 presidential election, the 75th United States Congress would have been charged with conducting the contingent election. In the 75th Congress, all members of the House of Representatives, and approximately one-third of the members of the Senate, had been elected in the 1936 elections. Section 3 of the 20th Amendment specifies that if the House of Representatives has not chosen a president-elect in time for the inauguration (noon on January 20), then the vice president-elect becomes acting president until the House selects a president. Section 3 also specifies that Congress may statutorily provide for who will be acting president if there is neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect in time for the inauguration. Under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, the Speaker of the House would become acting president until either the House selects a president or the Senate selects a vice president. None of these situations has ever occurred. The Constitution's silence on this point could have caused a constitutional crisis in the 1801 contingent election, as the House of Representatives seemed for a time to be hopelessly unable to resolve the Jefferson‚ÄìBurr Electoral College deadlock.  Procedures = Presidential election  Pursuant to the 12th Amendment, the House of Representatives is required to go into session immediately after the counting of the electoral votes to vote for president if no candidate for the office receives a majority of the electoral votes. In this event, the House is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes. Each state delegation votes en bloc, with each state having a single vote. A candidate is required to receive an absolute majority of state delegation votes (currently 26 votes) in order for that candidate to become the president-elect. The House continues balloting until it elects a president. As a consequence of the state delegation voting method, the party that holds the majority in the House could still lose the contingent election if the minority party holds the majority of state delegations. The District of Columbia, which is not a state, does not receive a vote (the 23rd Amendment, which granted the district electoral votes, did not also give it a vote in contingent elections). Historically, a delegation that did not give a majority of its vote to any one candidate was marked as \\"divided\\", and thus did not award its vote to any candidate. This practice, set by House rule, was responsible for turning the Jefferson‚ÄìBurr election of 1801 into a multiple ballot election. Also followed in 1825, but not a factor its outcome, the House could modify the rule for future contingent elections. Previous contingent presidential elections were held in closed session, and as such, the vote of each individual representative was not explicitly revealed outside the House Journal. The Constitution does not require a closed session for contingent elections, and future contingent elections could be held in an open session with public voting.  Vice-presidential election  Pursuant to the 12th Amendment, the Senate is required to go into session immediately after the counting of the electoral votes to vote for vice president if no candidate for the office receives a majority of the electoral votes. The Senate is limited to choosing from only the two candidates who received the most electoral votes. Unlike in the House, senators cast votes individually in this election. Because the Senate votes independently from the House during a contingent election, the House's presidential selection and the Senate's vice presidential selection could be from opposing parties. Additionally, the 12th Amendment states that a \\"majority of the whole number\\" of senators (currently 51 of 100) is necessary for election. In practical terms, this means that an absence or an abstention from voting is equivalent to a \\"None of the above\\" vote, and would impair the ability of both candidates to win the election. The explicit constitutional language about election by a majority of the whole number of senators may preclude the sitting vice president from breaking any tie which might occur, although some academics and journalists have speculated to the contrary.  Past contingent elections = Presidential election of 1800  The 1800 presidential election pitted Democratic-Republican ticket Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr against Federalist Party ticket John Adams and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. Under the Constitution as it then stood, before the passage of the 12th Amendment, each elector cast two votes, with no distinction between votes for president and for vice president, and the person receiving a majority of votes was elected president and the person receiving the second highest number of votes was elected vice president. Each party formed a plan in which one of their respective electors would vote for a third candidate or abstain so that their preferred presidential candidate (Adams for the Federalists and Jefferson for the Democratic-Republicans) would win one more vote than the party's other nominee. Democratic-Republicans failed to execute the plan, however, resulting in a tie between Jefferson and Burr with 73 electoral votes each, and a third place finish for Adams with 65 votes. The Constitution also mandated that, \\"if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse [sic] by Ballot one of them for President.\\" Therefore, Jefferson and Burr were admitted as candidates in the House election. Although the congressional election of 1800 turned over majority control of the House of Representatives to the Democratic-Republicans, the presidential election would be decided by the outgoing House, which had a Federalist majority. Even so, under the Constitution, in contingent elections the votes for the President are taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; consequently, in 1801, neither party had a majority as some states had split delegations. Given this deadlock, Democratic-Republican representatives, who generally favored Jefferson for president, contemplated two distasteful possible outcomes: either the Federalists manage to engineer a victory for Burr, or they refused to break the deadlock: the second scenario would leave a Federalist, Secretary of State John Marshall, as acting president come Inauguration Day. Over the course of seven days, from February 11 to 17, the House cast a total of 35 ballots, with Jefferson receiving the votes of eight state delegations each time, one short of the necessary majority of nine. On February 17, on the 36th ballot, Jefferson was elected after several Federalist representatives cast blank ballots, resulting in Maryland and Vermont's votes changing from no selection to Jefferson, thus giving him the votes of 10 states and the presidency. This situation was the impetus for the passage of the Twelfth Amendment, which provided for separate elections for president and vice president in the Electoral College.  Presidential election of 1824  The 1824 presidential election came at the end of the Era of Good Feelings in American politics, and featured four candidates who would win electoral votes: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay. While Andrew Jackson received more electoral and popular votes than any other candidate, he did not receive the majority of 131 electoral votes required to win the election, leading to a contingent election in the House of Representatives. (Vice presidential candidate John C. Calhoun easily defeated his rivals, as the support of both the Adams and Jackson camps gave him an unassailable lead over the other candidates.) Following the provisions of the 12th Amendment, only the top three candidates in the electoral vote (Jackson, Adams, and Crawford) were admitted as candidates in the House: Clay, the Speaker of the House at the time, was eliminated. Clay subsequently threw his support to Adams, who was elected President on February 9, 1825, on the first ballot with 13 states, followed by Jackson with seven, and Crawford with four. Adams' victory shocked Jackson, who, as the winner of a plurality of both the popular and electoral votes, expected to be elected president. By appointing Clay his Secretary of State, President Adams essentially declared him heir to the Presidency, as Adams and his three predecessors had all served as Secretary of State. Jackson and his followers accused Adams and Clay of striking a \\"corrupt bargain\\", which the Jacksonians would campaign on for the next four years, ultimately attaining Jackson's victory in the Adams‚ÄìJackson rematch in 1828.  Vice presidential election of 1836  In the 1836 presidential election, Democratic presidential candidate Martin Van Buren and his running mate Richard Mentor Johnson won the popular vote in enough states to receive a majority of the Electoral College. However, Virginia's 23 electors all became faithless electors and refused to vote for Johnson, leaving him one vote short of the 148-vote majority required to elect him. Under the 12th Amendment, a contingent election in the Senate had to decide between Johnson and Whig candidate Francis Granger. Johnson was elected easily in a single ballot by 33 to 16. Proposed alterations Some members of Congress have proposed constitutional amendments to alter the contingent election process. Some proposals call for the abolition of the Electoral College and the contingent election process in favor of the direct election of the president, with the candidate who receives a plurality or majority of the popular vote becoming president. Other proposals have sought to alter the contingent election process for president so that each member of the House, rather than each state delegation, holds one vote.

The airport was used by military aircraft during World War I. In addition, it was home of the Royal Flying Circus in the 1920s. A number of well-known aviators have flown into Wisener Field. These have included Wiley Post, \\"Slats\\" Rogers, Tommy Grace and Fay Lucille Cox. United States Senators Lyndon B. Johnson (later U.S. President), Phil Graham, and Kay Bailey Hutchison have flown into the airport.  Infrastructure  The airport has a single asphalt runway, 17/35, that measures .

The DJ, producer and three time DJ Awards winner for Best Producer and Best Deep House DJ, Mladen Solomun is one of the founders along with Adriano Trolio.  History  Before Adriano Trolio and Mladen Solomun founded Diynamic Music on November 4, 2006, Adriano worked as a promoter. He was one of the first guys who introduce the electro-house to Hamburg around 2002. At that time Solomun and Trolio throw monthly parties in which Solomun met Stimming and H.O.S.H with the same idea, to create their own label. The DIY name came up to make a reference to DIgital music. They are called Diynamic Music instead of Diynamic Records because there is not specific Diynamic sound. When they started, Diynamic Music used to be minimal, and they were also one of the first to try to mix old school Detroit sound in a modern European way. In 2013 the new kind of deep house that Diynamic played had many pop influences. It contained many vocals, a slow BPM, catchy bass-lines and sometimes even a chorus. In 2011, Adriano and Mladen launched their sub-label, 2DIY4 (to die for) a platform for anything that does not necessarily fit to Diynamic concept but they consider has to be released. This means bringing in a more overt pop influence.

The festival debuted on May 18, 2013 at the Arena Park in Amsterdam. Since then, organisers have taken the concept on the road hosting large-scale showcases in Mexico, Brazil and Ibiza, featuring strictly the Diynamic artists only. The second Diynamic Festival took place on May 30 at the Amsterdam Bos, a large forest about 30 minutes drive from the city centre. On May 29 two stages were presented for the third Diynamic Festival, the usual outdoor big mainstage and the new indoor second stage (all acts played longer sets).

He is known for sacrificing himself to help L√™ L·ª£i and the Vietnamese army escape from the Ming's blockade, a story that was later known as \\"Le Lai rescued Lord\\" (L√™ Lai c·ª©u ch√∫a Èªé‰æÜÊïë‰∏ª). History=Joining L√™ L·ª£i's army When L√™ L·ª£i started to assemble his army in 1416, L√™ Lai was one of the first men to join. L√™ Lai soon became one of L√™ L·ª£i's most trusted men, and during a meeting at L≈©ng Nhai, Le L·ª£i and 18 other men including L√™ Lai made an oath to protect Vietnam at all cost no matter what the consequences may be. In February 1418, the rebellion becomes active after L√™ L·ª£i proclaimed himself king.During this time, L√™ Lai was appointed as one of L√™ L·ª£i's subordinate commanders, a position he'll keep until his last stand at Ch√≠ Linh. Death In April 1418, two months after L√™ L·ª£i proclaimed himself as the king of the B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province, the Ming army surrounded a troop of Vietnamese rebels that included L√™ Lai and L√™ L·ª£i at the Ch√≠ Linh mountaintop for ten days. During those ten days, the Vietnamese troops had a shortage of food and water and were falling ill due to the cold weather. Fearing that the troops will soon be crushed by the Ming army and knowing that the capture of L√™ L·ª£i would lead to the end of the Vietnamese rebellion, L√™ Lai volunteered to pose as L√™ L·ª£i by wearing L√™ L·ª£i's armor and led an assault with 500 of the remaining Vietnamese troops and 2 elephants against the Ming army, giving time for L√™ L·ª£i to escape. While his diversion worked, L√™ Lai was captured and executed by the Ming army after his troops were crushed during the assault. Legacy Due to L√™ Lai's sacrifice, L√™ L·ª£i would live to fight the Ming army for nine more years until finally achieving victory and independence for Vietnam in 1427. Despite his life prior to the uprising being largely unknown, L√™ Lai is still seen as a symbol of bravery and patriotism in Vietnam. The story of his sacrifice is still told in Vietnam through history books, television, and folktales. After defeating the Ming army and becoming emperor of Vietnam, L√™ L·ª£i declared that if a memorial was ever to be held for him after his death, a memorial for L√™ Lai must be held one day before his own as a means of honoring Lai's heroism and sacrifice during the uprising. The memorial for both men are still celebrated in Vietnam today, with L√™ L·ª£i's memorial being on August 22nd, and L√™ Lai's on August 21st.

Metabolism Isopropylphenidine's metabolic pathway consists of N-oxidation, N-dealkylation, mono- and bis-hydroxylation of the benzene ring, and hydroxylation of the phenyl ring only after N-dealkylation. The dihydroxy metabolites were conjugated by methylation of one hydroxy group, and hydroxy metabolites by glucuronidation or sulfation.

With a combined installed capacity of , it is among the largest pumped-storage power stations in Japan. The facilities are run by the Chubu Electric Power Company. The station includes 4 distinct power plants. The first two power plants, Yahagi 1 and 2 are conventional power plants. The other two plants, Okuyahagi 1 and 2 are pumped-storage plants. Yahagi 1 uses water from the Yahagi Dam (Áü¢‰Ωú„ÉÄ„É†) and has a capacity of 60 MW. Yahagi 2 uses water from the Second Yahagi Dam (Áü¢‰ΩúÁ¨¨‰∫å„ÉÄ„É†), a smaller dam downstream of the main one, and has a capacity of 31.2 MW. The pumped-storage station has an unconventional configuration, with three reservoirs at different heights. The lower reservoir is created by Yahagi Dam on the Yahagi river. The upper reservoir is the Kuroda Dam lake, an artificial lake created by the Kuroda Dam. A third reservoir, in between the two at an intermediate elevation is formed by the Tominaga Dam. The two Okuyahagi power stations work in tandem between the three reservoirs. This configuration was necessary because of the geological conditions in the area, with a fault that prevented the safe construction of a single connection between upper and lower reservoirs. Okuyahagi 1 is the upper power plant, operating between the upper and the intermediate reservoir using 3 units with a combined capacity of 323 MW. The first unit started operation in September 1980, while the second and third units became operational in February 1981. The Okuyahagi 2 is the lower power plant operating between the intermediate reservoir and the lower reservoir employing 3 units with a combined capacity of 780 MW. Okuyahagi 2 became operational together with the first plant, with the first unit online in September 1980 and the other 2 in February 1981. The two plants operate as a single power station.

Rabbitt earned her bachelor of arts in geological sciences at Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard. During the time that Rabbitt studied at Radcliffe, it was against Harvard University's policies to allow students studying at Radcliffe to attend classes at Harvard, yet Harvard professor, Esper Larsen, allowed Rabbitt to work in his office under his tutelage. Rabbitt specialized in the seismology of nuclear explosions. Her work was acknowledged by \\"The Geological Society of America's History\\" for aiding in the rejuvenation of systematic research methods, when studying the earth. Alongside her contributions to the USGS, Rabbit revitalized the editorial process of scientific publications. She published seven works, including A Brief History of the U.S. Geological Survey,U.S. Geological Survey and Mary C. Rabbitt, 1975, A brief history of the U.S. Geological Survey, Washington, D.C., U.S. Government Printing Office, 36 p., https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70039204 (last accessed 5 Jan. 2018). three volumes of Minerals, Lands, and Geology for the Common Defense and General Welfare, John Wesley Powell‚Äôs Exploration of the Colorado River, John Wesley Powell: Soldier, Explorer, Scientist, and The United States Geological Survey, 1879-1989. In John Wesley Powell‚Äôs Exploration of the Colorado River, Rabbitt describes U.S. soldier, geologist, explorer, John Wesley Powell's, discoveries in the Colorado Plateau. She describes the depositional processes in the Grand Canyon as the Colorado River flows through the Grand Canyon, eroding the canyon walls and exposing layers of rock and fossil evidence recording a span of approximately two billion years. In Minerals, Lands, and Geology for the Common Defense and General Welfare Volume 2, 1879-1904, Rabbit outlines how the development of public land, mapping policies, and the development of mineral resources in the United States shaped the maturation of the field of geology. Volume 3 describes the USGS' interest in reviewing basic research from the 1904 conservation movement till strategic mineral studies. She outlines the struggles researchers faced during the intervention of the Federal government for conservation and public land classification. She describes how World War 1 and the subsequent economic crash in 1929 increased strain on the studies. She also conveyed how the changing economies of coal and agriculture and the need to study water and minerals put excess strain on the Survey. According to Rabbit, the study of geology was first differentiated from the study of natural history at a mining school in Freiberg, Saxony, but the science of geology began to advance once the United States Federal Government began employing geologists to evaluate mineral resources and classify mineral lands. Shortly after World War two, Rabbitt joined an allied group and helped interview Japanese scientists. In 1947, she married a geologist named John Charles Jack Rabbitt. Shortly after, in 1957 Rabbitt helped conduct studies about rock magnetics and further articulated the concepts of tectonics, geologic time scale, and the impact of factors such as stress and heat on stratification. l Mary's contributions were recognized when she received the Geological Society of America's History of Geology Award (1984). The award was renamed in her memory in 2005. Mary was also rewarded by the Department of the Interior's Distinguished Service Award(1988). The organizations hoped she would continue her path into making geology a more informed field.  Career  In 1937, after earning her bachelor of arts in geological sciences from Radcliffe, Mary C. Rabbitt worked alongside Perry Bylerly as a research assistant at the University of California. Continuing her career as a research assistant she would return to Radcliffe to work for Dr. Kirtley Mather. During the second world war she moved her career to Tennessee to serve at the Oak Ridge Observatory working with the Office of Scientific Research and Development on explosion seismology. After marrying John Rabbitt in 1947 Mary joined the U.S. Coast Guard and Geodetic Survey's seismology branch. Mary would later join her husband and work for the USGS headlining the Geophysical Abstracts Unit. She would also work with branch chief James Balsley, Jr on a variety of projects. This led to a greater understanding of various topics including magnetic-ore deposits, geological time scales, global tectonics and the behaviour of rocks and soils under various temperatures and pressures. Retiring in 1978 Rabbitt would go on to produce a three part history and assessment of federal earth- science and mapping policies. These texts covered the late 18th century and early 19th century reviewing topics in American history such as politics, economics and democracy through the lens of geologic history, minerals and mining. Rabbitt also provides information about geography, topography and palaeontology.  Personal life  Rabbitt is of Irish heritage and grew up in the Boston, Massachusetts, suburb of Canton. She attended Radcliffe institute for Advanced Study at Harvard graduating in 1937, after graduation she worked as a research assistant at the University of California, then at Radcliffe. She then moved to Tennessee to work with the Office of Scientific research and Development. Shortly after World War II in 1947 she married John \\"Jack\\" Charles Rabbitt, a geologist in the USGS. They had no children of their own however Mary would later become an aunt of two nephews and a niece. Mary C. Rabbitt retired in 1978 and would pass away August 8th, 2002.

During this period, he was affected by the May Fourth Movement and by the winter of 1921, he joined the newly founded Communist Party of China. After returning from Russia in 1930, he assisted Zhou Enlai in Shanghai's personnel and military transport work and at the same time participated in the translation of the \\"Soviet Infantry Fighting Order\\" and \\"Soviet Political Work Regulations\\". During the Long March in 1935, Fu was responsible for communal distribution and conducting preparatory work for combat. In August, he was elected as an alternate member of the 6th Central Committee. Upon Zhang Guotao's attempt to set up an alternate communist base, Fu classified him as an \\"alternate member of the Politburo\\" but refused to work for his branch of the central committee. Following the rendezvous between the 4th Red and 2nd Red Armies in July 1937 he became the director for Central Committee Northwest Organization Department that was based in Shaanbei. He was then appointed as the head of the political department in the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University. A picture of Eighth Route Army leaders during the Sino-Japanese War. From left, Huang Kecheng, Deng Xiaoping, Fu Zhong During Sino-Japanese War Fu attended the Luochuan Conference in August 1938 and was appointed as the director of civil affairs within the Eighth Route Army's political department. Simultaneously, he put forward the \\"Political Army Reform Program\\" which was published alongside \\"Political Military Order\\" that involved key leaders such as Zhu De, Peng Dehuai and Zuo Quan. In the spring of 1940, he issued orders for the Eighth Army to be involved in the communes and when he returned to Yan'an during winter, he was holding key positions such as being the deputy director of the CMC's and the Joint Defense Forces' (based at Yan'an) Political Department. In 1945, he participated in the 7th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, receiving praise from Mao Zedong for a speech regarding the unity of the party (Â¢ûÂº∫ÂÖöÁöÑÂõ¢ÁªìÔºåÂèçÂØπÂ±±Â§¥‰∏ª‰πâ) at the meeting. Chinese Civil War (1946-1950) In the beginning of 1946, Fu was transferred to Chongqing to take charge as the President of Xinhua Daily and the Propaganda minister for Sichuan. He also contributed to key doctrines of the CPC's military and politics, such as being involved in the publishing of \\"The Chinese People's Liberation Army Party Committee Ordinance (Draft)\\", \\"Revolutionary Military Commission Regulations\\", \\"New Red Army Initial Summary\\" and other documents. In the 1st National Artists Congress during July 1949, he published a report on the \\"Contributions of the Army to Art\\".

She is a 2012 laureate of the Cartier Women's Initiative. Career & ClickMedix Shih received her MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, and a master's degree in Systems Engineering, also from MIT. While she was a graduate student at MIT, she developed her first company, Click Diagnostics. Said company won the USAID 2.0 Challenge, and the World Health Care Congress Best Telemedicine Award. However, she was unhappy with the scale of the telemedicine system, and left the company to develop what would become ClickMedix. While at MIT, she was challenged with developing a healthcare business that would help a billion people. After receiving this challenge, she developed the idea for ClickMedix. In her words, \\"In developing countries they have scarce access to healthcare, but they do have mobile phones, and the idea spread from there, and all the way to the developed world too.\\" Thus, Shih decided to utilize cell phones to bring better healthcare to developing countries. The software allows patients and healthcare professionals to communicate with specialists using a mobile phone. One way in which they can communicate is by taking a picture of an injury and sending it to a specialist. ClickMedix was launched in 2011, with the initial aim of Botswanan women be screened for cervical cancer. From Botswana, the technology spread to Ghana, and spread again to 16 countries around the world. As of 2015, ClickMedix has helped over 100,000 patients in India be more effectively screened for ear infections. Hearing loss is a common diagnosis in India, and access to quick diagnosis through ClickMedix has improved the lives of thousands of people. ClickMedix has also helped reduce some patient wait times from months to 72 hours, and has helped physicians serve 15 times the number of patients they would normally be able to serve. ClickMedix also helps healthcare workers, as they are able to learn from the specialists they communicate with, and also communicate methods that they have learned with specialists. Shih hopes to further expand her business, while also looking for ways for remote doctors to be paid for their services more reliably. Her ultimate goal is to have one-click health care.

After, the urban district became a municipal borough in 1955 and the area then became the centre of a London borough in 1965, civic leaders decided to procure a purpose-built civic centre. The site they selected had been occupied by an office building erected by Middlesex County Council. The new building, which was designed by Andrew Derbyshire, was acclaimed as one of the most famous buildings in the British neo-vernacular style. It was planned from 1970 and the construction work, which was undertaken by Higgs and Hill at a cost of ¬£5.6 million, started in January 1973. It opened in stages from 1976 with a formal opening by the chairman of the British Airports Authority, Norman Payne, on 28 April 1979. Derbyshire's design envisaged a diamond-shaped building to the west containing the offices of the council officers and their departments and a more irregular shaped building to the east containing the public areas including the council chamber, the civic suite and register office. The main frontage to the public areas, facing onto the High Street, featured a loggia with eight entrances and a steep roof, with a two-storey block with a clock tower behind. The design made extensive use of brick and tile, to pay homage to traditional homely brick architecture of nearby buildings and suburban developments that were \\"indigenous to the borough\\". It was designated a Grade II Listed Building in April 2018.

The steamer was built, launched, placed in service, and wrecked within a single year. The rapids on the Snake river had only rarely been surmounted by a steamboat, and generally only with the aid of a steel cable for lining used to winch the entire boat upstream through the rapids. After only a few trips, Imnaha was destroyed in Mountain Sheep rapids, just downstream from the mining settlement of Eureka, on the Oregon side of the river. Construction Imnaha was built at Lewiston, Idaho for the Lewiston Southern Company or the Lewiston Southern Navigation Company. According to one source, the steamer was supposedly built much less strongly than other boats of the day. According to another source, Imnaha was \\"studily built and cross-braced in the bow.\\" Imnaha was the most important boat built on the upper Columbia river system in 1903. The builder was Joseph Supple. Another source gives the builder's name as one Kaston. Most of the work was done in Portland, Oregon, with the components sent to Lewiston in \\"knock-down\\" form for assembly by the Snake River. There was some delay in obtaining delivery of the boat's boilers, and so it was planned to launch the boat without them. When delivered, the boilers were to furnish steam at 250 pounds pressure, generating 500 horsepower The rapids on the Snake River flowed at speeds of 12 miles per hour in some places, and the only way for the boat to negotiate the currents going up river was to line through them by cranking in a steel cable attached to a steel bolt mounted in a rock on the shore. Prior to the completion of the boat, the president of the company, G.A. Nehrhood, stated that the vessel's speed of 17 miles per hour should alone allow it to surmount the rapids, and the hoisting cable was just an extra precaution. Imnaha would be equipped with one-half mile of steel cable connected to a capstan powered by a steam donkey engine to haul the steamer up through the rapids. No boat had yet negotiated the rapids upstream on the Snake River. By April 29, 1903, the boilers still had not been delivered. Owners and officers The Lewiston Southern Company was a subsidiary of the Eureka Mining Company, which was formed to exploit a supposed copper-rich mining area near Eureka, Oregon. The men behind the Eureka Mining Company were named Barton and Hibbs. They were engaged in stock fraud, by overstating the value of the company's stock, and then disappearing with the proceeds. Capt. Harry C. Baughman (1872-1932) was to be the master of Imnaha. J.C. Campbell was to be chief engineer. Dimensions Imnaha was over hull (exclusive of fantail, which was the extension over the stern on which the stern-wheel was mounted, with a beam of over hull (exclusive of guards, and depth of hold of . The overall size of the steamer was 330 gross and 216 registered tons. Imnaha was licensed to carry 100 passengers Imnaha was reported to have cost $20,000 to build. Engineering The boiler for Imnaha was built by W. J. Salberg & Son of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The boiler was about 13 feet long, 60 inches in diameter and contained 178 flue pipes, each 2.25 inches in diameter. It was tested to a steam pressure of 225 pounds per square inch. Imnaha's boilers were coal-fired, and required loading of 70 tons of coal per trip. The boat was equipped with a complete blacksmithing outfit on board. Regarding the steamer's ability to run upstream through rapids, Captain Baughman claimed that \\"with good fuel, the Imnaha could climb a tree.\\" The best fuel was pitch-filled pine, but there was little of it available at the river level in Hell's Canyon. Cordword cut in the higher elevations had to be hauled eight miles by wagon, and was expensive. Route The steamer Imnaha was the sole source of supplies for the 2,000 people who had flooded into Eureka, 55 miles upriver from Lewiston, based on news of the copper strike. Imnaha made 14 trips to Eureka from Lewiston. Before the construction of the Imnaha, all the supplies for the mines at Eureka had to be hauled overland from Elgin, OR. Eighty men were employed at the Lewiston Southern's mines at Eureka. In April, 1903, the company was reported to have invested $500,000 invested in mines and granite quarries at Eureka. On April 29, 1903, a pre- fabricated smelter was on the dock at Lewiston, waiting for Imnaha to be completed so it could be hauled up to Eureka to be assembled. Operations Imnaha in Mountain Sheep rapids. On April 21, 1903, Imnaha was reported to be \\"complete in every detail except the boiler.\\" There was at that time no definitive date by which the boiler was to arrive, and it would take about 10 days work to install the boiler once it did arrive. The boilers finally arrived in Lewiston on Sunday night, June 14, 1903. The reason for the delay was that the boat's chief engineer, J.C. Campbell, having inspected the route, ordered changes to the boiler design. Trial run On Saturday July 1, 1903, Imnaha made its trial run to Riparia, Washington. First commercial trip On July 4, Imnaha made its first commercial trip upriver to the town of Eureka, Oregon, on the Oregon side of the Snake River, at the mouth of the Imnaha River. Eureka Bar landing was 52 miles upriver from Lewiston. It took the steamer 14 hours to make the round trip. This was only the second time that a steamer had reached Eureka at the confluence of the Imnaha and the Snake rivers. Capt. Harry C. Baughman, son of pioneer steamboat captain, E.W. Baughman, was in command. The first steamer had been the Colonel Wright, in 1864. Navigation improvement work Low water in July and August hindered of steamboat operations. The main navigation obstructions on the Snake River between Lewiston and Pittsburg Landing were rock ledges and isolated boulders in the rapids, which at all stages of the river were hazardous, to a greater or lesser degree, to navigation. At the beginning of the low water season in July 1903, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers hired a blasting crew to work in small boats to remove boulders at Mountain Sheep Rapids, Bear Creek Rapids, and upriver from the mouth of the Salmon River. However the current, flowing at 10 to 14 miles per hour, was so swift that it was possible to do this work safely or effectively in small boats. Arrangements were made then to contract with the steamer Imnaha, at $47.50 per day, to perform the work. The boat began work on August 15, 1903. Using the steamer, a steam drill could be used on the submerged rocks and ledges in the middle of the stream. Obstructions at Ten-Mile Rapids, Buffalo Rock, and Grand Ronde rapids. On its first trip to improve navigation, Imnaha embarked ten 50-pound boxes of high grade explosives. On September 4, 1903, Imnaha suffered a mishap on Wild Goose rapids, which knocked a hole in the hull, requiring the vessel to be taken downriver to Riparia for repairs, and forcing abandonment of the use of the steam drill. A crew was left at Wild Goose rapids to work from small boats, but this effort had to be suspended on September 11, 1903 due to low water in the river. There was a great demand for river transport to the mines, and freight was backed up on the dock at Eureka waiting to be carried upriver by Imnaha. In early September 1903, Imnaha was reported to be unable to ascend the Snake River. On November 7, 1903, the river level at Lewiston was reported to be rising, so that soon Imnaha could resume its trips upriver to Eureka. Wreck For a steamer move upriver through the rapids on the Snake River, It was necessary to \\"line\\" through the rapids. Lining consisted of running a cable out from a winch on the steamer to a bolt secured in a rock on the shore. Once the cable was secured to the bolt, the winch would then crank in the cable, pulling the steamer upstream through the rapids. On Monday, November 9, 1903, Imnaha was proceeding upriver from Lewiston, and had just lined through Mountain Sheep Rapids, when a lining cable became entangled with the steamer's eccentric rod.Annual Report of the Inspector General, U.S. Steamboat Inspection Service, 1904, p. 22. Mountain Sheep Rapids were two miles downriver from Eureka. This prevented the stern-wheel from turning, causing it to lose forward momentum.A non-contemporaneous source states that Imnaha was wrecked at Wild Goose Rapids; this is incorrect. Imnaha drifted back downriver into the rapids, where it was wrecked and became an $18,000 total loss. All passengers were rescued. Loss to the cargo was estimated at $1,000. An early newspaper report estimated the cargo loss at $8,000 and the steamer value at $25,000. There was no insurance.

Rice and a racist depiction of African-Americans and their culture. The character was based on a folk trickster named Jim Crow that had long been popular among black slaves. Rice also adapted and popularized a traditional slave song called \\"Jump Jim Crow\\" (1828). The character is dressed in rags and wears a battered hat and torn shoes. Rice applied blackface makeup made of burnt cork to his face and hands and impersonated a very nimble and irreverently witty African American field hand who sang, \\"Come listen all you galls and boys, I'm going to sing a little song, my name is Jim Crow, weel about and turn about and do jis so, eb'ry time I weel about I jump Jim Crow.\\" Origin The actual origin of the Jim Crow character has been lost to legend. One story claims it is Rice's emulation of a black slave that he had seen on his travels throughout the Southern United States, whose owner was a Mr. Crow. Several sources describe Rice encountering an elderly black stableman working in one of the river towns where Rice was performing. According to some accounts the man had a crooked leg and deformed shoulder. He was singing about Jim Crow, and punctuating each stanza with a little jump. According to Edmon S. Conner, an actor who worked with Rice early in his career, the alleged encounter happened in Louisville, Kentucky. Conner and Rice were both engaged for a summer season at the city theater, which at the back overlooked a livery stable. An elderly and deformed slave working in the stable yard often performed a song and dance he had improvised for his own amusement. The actors saw him, and Rice \\"watched him closely, and saw that here was a character unknown to the stage. He wrote several verses, changed the air somewhat, quickened it a good deal, made up exactly like Daddy and sang it to a Louisville audience. They were wild with delight...\\" According to Conner, the livery stable was owned by a white man named Crow, whose name the elderly slave adopted. A more likely explanation behind the origin of the character is that Rice had observed and absorbed African American traditional song and dance over many years. He grew up in a racially integrated Manhattan neighborhood, and later Rice toured the Southern slave states. According to the reminiscences of Isaac Odell, a former minstrel who described the development of the genre in an interview given in 1907, Rice appeared onstage at Louisville, Kentucky, in the 1830s and learned there to mimic local black speech: \\"Coming to New York he opened up at the old Park Theatre, where he introduced his Jim Crow act, impersonating a black slave. He sang a song, 'I Turn About and Wheel About', and each night composed new verses for it, catching on with the public and making a great name for himself.\\"New York Times, May 19, 1907. \\"The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels; Interesting of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago\\". Retrieved September 8, 2019 via Newspapers.com. Jim Crow laws Rice's famous stage persona eventually lent its name to a generalized negative and stereotypical view of black people. The shows peaked in the 1850s, and after Rice's death in 1860 interest in them faded. There was still some memory of them in the 1870s however, just as the \\"Jim Crow\\" segregation laws were surfacing in the United States. The Jim Crow periodwhich started when segregation rules, laws, and customs surfaced after the Reconstruction era ended in the 1870sexisted until the 1960s when the struggle for civil rights in the United States gained national attention.  Legacy  By 1838, the term \\"Jim Crow\\" was used as an offensive term towards black people through to the end of the 19th century before it became associated with Jim Crow laws. The \\"Jim Crow\\" character as portrayed by Rice popularized the perception of African-Americans as lazy, untrustworthy, dumb, and unworthy of integration. Rice's performances helped to popularize American minstrelsy, in which many performers imitated Rice's use of blackface and stereotypical depiction, touring around the United States. Those performers continued to spread the racist overtones and ideas manifested by the character to populations across the United States, contributing to white Americans developing a negative view of African- Americans in both their character and their work ethic. Another character with the name Jim Crow was featured in the 1941 Walt Disney animated feature film Dumbo portrayed as a literal crow. The character, originally named Jim Crow on the original model sheets, was changed in the 1950s to \\"Dandy Crow\\" in attempt to avoid controversy. Floyd Norman, the first African-American animator hired at Walt Disney Productions during the 1950s, said that the reason for Jim's name was to make a cartoony jab at the Jim Crow laws in the South in an article entitled Black Crows and Other PC Nonsense. In the music video for Childish Gambino's \\"This Is America\\", Gambino shoots a man in the back of the head 53 seconds into the video while posing like a Jim Crow caricature.

During World War II, she lived in the Blouvlei settlement, where she became politically active with the Cape Flats Distress Association, resisting efforts to relocate the squatting residents.

Recorded during a performance at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tennessee, the album features improvised versions of material taken from the duo's first studio album Coming Apart and the single \\"The Show Is Over\\". It continues the project's trend of rejecting traditional musical structures and utilizing various methods of distorting their sound.  Background  In 2013, Body/Head received high-praise for the free structure and improvisation found on their debut album Coming Apart, which drew comparisons to early releases by bassist Kim Gordon's former band, Sonic Youth. At the time the material on No Waves was recorded, the duo was performing live at the Bijou Theater for the 2014 Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tennessee to promote the release of Coming Apart. Since the project formed in 2012, Body/Head has only arranged a limited touring schedule, making the album a rare glimpse into the act's live prowess. Guitarist Bill Nace explained in an interview for Rolling Stone magazine that the album's good sound-quality resulted from \\"microphones on the amps, not post-production whitewashing\\". He added \\"this particular raw mix had a certain character that held together as a whole\\". The three tracks on No Waves have all previously appeared on past Body/Head releases, albeit in different structural forms: \\"The Show Is Over\\" is the A-side of a single distributed in 2014, and \\"Abstract Actress\\" is a medley of the two Coming Apart songs. Music critic Andy Cush notes that, rather than attempting to replicate their studio work, the duo \\"treat the songs as rough outlines for further improvision, to be colored in as the musicians please\\".

History The complex was built in the thirteenth century as part of the Republic of Siena, and became an important defensive structure. It was sold in the middle of the fifteenth century to the lords of the castle of Cotone, who also owned part of the nearby castle of Sabatina. During the Renaissance period, redevelopment work was carried out that led to the overlapping of newer stylistic elements with the existing medieval ones. In the mid-sixteenth century, the castle became part of the territory administered by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and remained in private ownership. Restorations were completed at the end of the twentieth century. Current The castle is currently operated as a hotel and farm. One of the two original stone square towers is well-preserved. The buildings that make up the complex are organized around an inner courtyard, which is accessed through an archway; the walls are completely covered in stone. Not far from the castle was an old church, now deconsecrated and used as a private residence, which is recognizable by its bell tower.

He is known for his studies on the DNA replication and cell cycle regulation in Helicobacter pylori and Plasmodium falciparum, two pathogens affecting humans. An elected fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, India, Indian National Science Academy and the Indian Academy of Sciences, he is also a recipient of the National Bioscience Award for Career Development of the Department of Biotechnology in 2010. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 2012, for his contributions to biological sciences.  Biography  Suman Kumar Dhar, born on 6 March 1968 in the Indian state of West Bengal, graduated in chemistry from Burdwan University in 1989 and completed his master's degree in biochemistry in 1992 from Kalyani University before securing a PhD in molecular biology from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in 1998. After working briefly (1997‚Äì98) as a research assistant at the department of microbiology of the University of Nebraska, he did his post-doctoral studies at Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital of Harvard Medical School which he completed in 2001. Returning to India the same year, he joined Jawaharlal Nehru University as an assistant professor at the Special Centre for Molecular Medicine (SCMM) of the university where he rose in ranks to become an associate professor in 2005 and a professor in 2011, finally reaching the position of the chairperson of SCMM in 2011. In between, he served as a visiting fellow at Harvard Medical School (2002‚Äì03), Harvard School of Public Health (2003‚Äì04) and Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (2007); he also served as a Humboldt Research Fellow at Bernhard Nocht Institute in 2008. Besides his academic duties at JNU, Dhar is involved in the establishment of Centre of Excellence in Parasitology, a Department of Biotechnology-funded project. He was also a member of the proctorial committee constituted by JNU to inquire about the 2016 JNU protests.  Career  Dhar's research history starts during his graduate studies when he worked on Entamoeba histolytica, the protozoan which causes amoebiasis, focusing on its ribosomal DNA circle. Later at Harvard Medical School, his post-doctoral studies were centered on mammalian DNA replication which assisted him to identify the ORC6 (origin recognition complex subunit six) and its role in viral DNA replication. He also identified geminin, a replication inhibitor, as a blocking factor of viral DNA replication, a discovery which earned him a US patent. Later, he studied the human pathogens, Helicobacter pylori and Plasmodium falciparum and their DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. He also worked on anti-malarial drugs and proposed Acriflavine as an anti- malarial agent, which has also been patented by him. His work has identified PfGyrase for P. falciparum and HpDnaB helicase for H. pylori as targets and these researches are reported to be helpful in drug discovery efforts for Gastric ulcers, Gastric adenocarcinomas and Malaria. Dhar has documented his research by way of a number of articles and online repositories such as PubMed and Pubfacts have listed many of them. He has contributed chapters to three books which include Epigenetics: Development and Disease by Tapas Kumar Kundu. He is associated with many science journals such as Journal of Biological Chemistry, Molecular Microbiology, FEBS Journal and Medical Science Monitor as an ad-hoc reviewer and has delivered featured talks including his oration at the Gordon Research Conference on Host-Parasite interaction held in Rhode Island in 2012.  Awards and honors  While in the US, Dhar received two grants for his researches, a grant from the National Institutes of Health for studies on emerging infectious diseases (1997‚Äì98) and the United States Department of the Army grant for research on breast cancer (2000‚Äì03). He received the Senior International Research Fellowship of the Wellcome Trust in 2005, the tenancy of the fellowship extending to 2010, and on its expiry, he received the Wellcome Trust-DBT Senior Research Fellowship in 2010. In 2006, Dhar received the Swarnajayanthi Fellowship of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and four years later, DBT honored him again with the 2010 National Bioscience Award for Career Development. He was elected to the Guha Research Conference in 2007 and the next year brought him the Alexander Von Humboldt Fellowship and the Swarnajayanti Fellowship of the Department of Science and Technology. A member of the American Society for Microbiology, Dhar was awarded the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in 2012. The National Academy of Sciences, India elected him as a fellow in 2011 and he became a fellow of the Indian National Science Academy and the Indian Academy of Sciences in 2016.

It was established by the District Councils Act 1887, which took effect from 5 January 1888. The creation of the council followed resident advocacy for the creation of a local government in Terowie in 1887. The council comprised the cadastral Hundreds of Ketchowla, Terowie and Wonna at its creation. The council rented offices in the Terowie Institute building from 1888 to 1890 before purchasing an Anglican church which the congregation had outgrown; the former church was used as council chambers for the remainder of the council's existence. It gained a portion of the Hundred of Whyte in 1899, resulting in an increase from three to four numbered wards. The council's public works included roadworks throughout the district and kerbing, footpaths, stormwater drainage and tree planting in Terowie township, with more limited works in Yarcowie. In 1923, the council was responsible for an area of 475 square miles, with a population of 1,300 residing in 300 dwellings. The capital value of ratable property was reported as ¬£406,619. In that year, the only other \\"township of any importance\\" besides Terowie was reported to be Yarcowie. The council ceased to exist on 1 May 1935 when it was amalgamated into the adjacent District Council of Hallett following a Local Government Commission report into reducing the number of municipalities in the state. The complex amalgamation saw it almost simultaneously gain part of the abolished District Council of Booborowie and then, on its new boundaries, merge into the Hallett council.

The Word Qubeys is an ancient Somali word which was once common amongst the traditional Somali population. The word itself means cleanliness.

Orphaned as a child, she supported herself at 14 by working in the cotton mills, and later as a domestic and a seamstress. She was active in the abolitionist and labor movements, volunteered in military hospitals during the Civil War, and founded a charity for poor working women in Boston. In 1870, at the invitation of Susan B. Anthony, she addressed the National Woman Suffrage Association convention in Washington. The following year, she became one of the first working-class women in the United States to publish a volume of her own writings: Nature's Aristocracy; Or, Battles and Wounds in Time of Peace. A Plea for the Oppressed.  Biography = Early life  Jennie Collins was born into poverty in Amoskeag, New Hampshire (now part of Manchester), in 1828. Orphaned as a child, she was raised by her Quaker grandmother, who died when Jennie was 14. Left to fend for herself, she worked for some time in the cotton mills of Lawrence and Lowell, then as a domestic in the home of Judge John Lowell in Boston. From 1861 to 1870 she worked as a vest maker for Macullar, Williams & Parker, a clothing manufacturer whose owners later helped finance her philanthropic endeavors. While working in Boston she took evening classes in history and politics, and taught a history class herself at the Church of the Unity. Collins was an admirer of the Unitarian minister Theodore Parker, who was preaching in Boston at the time.Hoxie (1971), p. 362. She was also deeply interested in Spiritualism, a religious movement that was linked with labor and women's rights.Ranta (2010), p. xiii. Collins was an outspoken opponent of slavery, as was Parker. During the Civil War she volunteered in military hospitals, taught soldiers' children, and organized a group of local women who did charitable work for Union soldiers in their spare time.Ranta (2010), p. xi.  Activism  While still working as a vest maker, Collins began speaking out on labor and women's issues and campaigning for political candidates. At one event, at which she was the sole woman speaker, she spoke in support of Ulysses S. Grant, Charles Sumner, and William Claflin. She made her first major public address in 1868, at Washington Hall, in support of women's rights. She approached the subject from a distinctly working-class perspective, much as Margaret Foley did decades later. That same year, she spoke at the organizing conference of the Daughters of St. Crispin, the first national women's labor union in the United States. Her reputation grew, and she became one of Boston's leading speakers on issues such as child labor reform, the eight-hour day, and better wages and working conditions for women. In 1869 she joined the National Labor Reform League and helped organize the Boston Working Women's League. In the fall of 1869 she spoke in support of striking workers at the Cocheco Mill in Dover, New Hampshire. At one event, she addressed a crowd of thousands at Huntington Hall in Lowell, where she called for a boycott: \\"We working women will wear fig-leaf dresses before we will patronize the Cocheco Company.\\" Her rousing speech attracted the notice of suffragist Susan B. Anthony, who invited Collins to speak at the 1870 convention of the National Woman Suffrage Association. Her speech at the Union League Hall in Washington was a \\"decided success\\". One observer wrote later that Collins \\"tells her stories with such a tender, natural pathos that few eyes are dry during her speeches.\\"Stanton et al. (1882), p. 435.  Boffin's Bower  Artist's depiction of Boffin's Bower. Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, 1887. In the summer of 1870, with the backing of area business leaders, Collins established Boffin's Bower, a social center for working women, at 813 Washington Street. Its unusual name was derived from the Dickens novel, Our Mutual Friend. As Collins explained later, \\"If I had called my place 'Headquarters for Working Women,' or by any similar name, it would have attracted no attention whatever. But when I put up the sign 'Boffin's Bower' everybody ran up to the room to see what the place was. I made lots of acquaintances and friends that way, and got a great deal of help.\\" Boffin's Bower started modestly as a sitting room with a piano, and expanded to include a reading room with books and newspapers, and a workshop with sewing machines. The Bower provided food and clothing to the needy, and temporary lodging to a small number of homeless women. Through her connections with local businesses, Collins helped hundreds of women find employment each year; among them, the first female employees of the Boston Post Office. On special occasions she arranged for entertainment; there were Christmas dinners, comical readings, musical performances, and lectures by local speakers such as Julia Ward Howe. Collins knew that charitable work could not address the underlying causes of poverty, and she continually tried to do more. At one point she planned to open a \\"kitchen school\\", and in 1871 she petitioned the state legislature for aid in establishing a Young Woman's Apprentice Association to provide job training for unskilled workers.Neill (1910), p. 31. Through the Working Women's League, she and Aurora Phelps tried to create a woman-run homesteading community called \\"Aurora\\" in rural Massachusetts, but could not raise enough capital. Meanwhile, Collins had the more immediate needs of her \\"girls\\" to attend to. In 1872, the Great Boston Fire destroyed 65 acres of Boston's downtown. Hundreds of women who had lost their jobs, and in some cases their homes as well, flocked to the Bower for help. To raise funds for Boffin's Bower, Collins gave paid lectures and organized an annual fair. She also contributed most of the proceeds from her book, Nature's Aristocracy, edited by Russell Conwell and published in 1871. Collins was one of the first working-class women in the United States to publish a volume of her own writings. The book is a collection of autobiographical sketches, polemics, and fictional vignettes, loosely centered around the argument that American society had strayed from the ideals enshrined in the Constitution, creating a corrupt aristocracy and dangerous levels of wealth inequality. Despite her lack of formal education, and perhaps inspired by working-class writers such as Lucy Larcom as well as Dickens, Collins dreamed of a literary career that never materialized. Her annual reports on Boffin's Bower, however, were widely read and reported on in newspapers across the country, calling attention to the needs of those she called \\"the accidental poor\\": those who worked hard but could not support themselves in sickness or old age, and who could not obtain help from charitable institutions because they had not been \\"trained as mendicants\\". She wrote movingly of the plight of working mothers who had no access to affordable child care, women who were paid starvation wages, and girls who were cheated of their pay. In 1874 her input was sought by the State Bureau of Labor Statistics for a report on Boston's working women. She never married. Her contemporaries were apt to describe her in terms at once unflattering and admiring: unrefined and pugnacious; intelligent, witty, and kind-hearted. A reporter's description in the Sacramento Daily Union is typical: > A little, thin, angular, wiry figure, long past the bloom of youth, scorning > all pretensions to the conventionalities of society or the rostrum, she is > pre-eminently the champion and exponent of the working-women of New England.  Later years  Despite suffering from asthma, Collins was active until the end of her life. She contributed prolifically to newspapers and journals, as well as publishing annual reports for Boffin's Bower. During her last years, she lived in the home of a widowed friend named Eveline J. Pillsbury, and Pillsbury's brother. In 1887, she died of consumption at the home of a friend in Brookline. Her grave marker at the Walnut Hills Cemetery reads, \\"Jennie Collins, the Working-Girl's Friend, and Founder of 'Boffin's Bower.' Died July 20, 1887, aged 59 Years.\\"Ranta (2010), pp. xii, xiv.  Legacy  Boffin's Bower predated South End House, considered Boston's first settlement house, by nearly two decades.Ranta (2010), p. xii. Although Boffin's Bower served many of the same functions as a settlement house, it was not staffed by upper-class, college-educated reformers intent on studying the problems of the working poor, but by a working-class woman already familiar with them. After Collins's death, a women's charitable organization called the Helping Hand Society took over the work of Boffin's Bower, opening a low-rent rooming house for working girls on Carver Street (now Charles Street South), near the Women's Educational and Industrial Union. The Rev. Edward Everett Hale remarked at the time that thirty or forty such homes were needed in Boston.Hale (1888), p. 128. A new edition of Nature's Aristocracy was published by the University of Nebraska in 2010. In her introduction, historian Judith Ranta calls it \\"the first attempt by a U.S. author of any background or gender to produce an extended overview of working-class life.\\"Ranta (2010), p. ix.

Geremia was born in Palermo but spent an extended period of time in Bologna - where he experienced a radical conversion - and Fiesole for his admittance into the Dominicans before returning to Palermo where he became a sought after and noted preacher and miracle worker. Geremia's beatification was confirmed in 1784. Life Pietro Geremia was born in Palermo on 10 August 1399 to aristocrats. Geremia studied at the Bologna college since being sent there in 1417 and was perceived to be an excellent law student and his own pride led him to believe this to be true. One night in 1422 he dwelled on his vain success and what his future would bring when a deceased male relative knocked on his third floor window; Geremia sat upright and asked who was there before seeing this relative. The relative told him that his pride lost him a chance at entering heaven and so warned Geremia not to repeat his mistakes. The shaken Geremia purchased an iron chain as a penitential act from a locksmith the next morning and began to contemplate what his vocation might be. He received a sign that it was to enter the Order of Preachers; his enraged father came to Bologna to stop him but saw how pleased Geremia was with his decision when he entered. He started his novitiate in Fiesole and was ordained to the priesthood in 1424. He made his vows in 1423 and returned to Palermo in 1433. His fame as a preacher caught the attention of Vincent Ferrer who once visited him and the two discussed spiritual matters at great lengths. Geremia was seen as one of the finest preachers on the island and preached in the open often because the churches never could hold the vast number of people that flocked to see him. On one particular occasion there was no food for the people and he asked a fisherman for a donation but the fisherman refused him in a rude manner. So he got into a boat and rowed out to sea and made a sign to the fish who broke the nets in the water and followed him back to the shore. The fisherman apologized and so he made another sign to the fish who returned to the nets in the sea. On another occasion he was preaching on repentance in Catania when Mount Etna erupted in 1444; the people begged him to save him and he went to the Saint Agatha shrine and removed the saint's veil. He held the veil towards the flow of lava heading towards the town and the eruption and lava flow ceased. Geremia was sent to establish regular observance to all those Dominican monasteries in the Sicilian area - in particular Santa Caterina convent - and Pope Eugene IV once called him to Florence in 1439 to help heal the rift between the Greek and Latin churches - he managed a brief union. He was once offered a bishopric but refused it. He died on 3 March 1452 in the Santa Zita convent in Palermo. Beatification Geremia's beatification received the approval of Pope Pius VI on 12 May 1784.

Trueheart House is a residence of historic significance located in the town of Fort Davis, the seat and largest town of Jeff Davis County in the U.S. state of Texas. The house was built in 1898 and, along with the surrounding property, was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1996. The Trueheart House has also been distinguished as a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark (RTHL) since 1964. Description The Trueheart House and surrounding property occupy a one- block portion of the Paradise Valley Subdivision on the western edge of the town of Fort Davis located at 101 Madrone Street although officially at 804 Court Avenue with the county tax appraisal district even though the house faces eastward toward Madrone rather than northward toward Court. The property is bounded on the north by Court Ave., on the east by Madrone St. (formerly known as Seventh Street), and on the south by Woodward Avenue. No street separates the property from others to the west. Palisade cliffs of the Davis Mountains partially enclose the town to the north and west providing a backdrop setting for the property. An outcrop of large boulders extending northward from the north and northwest facings of the house provide a transition from the cliffs to an expansive view of a Chihuahuan Desert high- altitude plateau to the southeast. Court Avenue, running along the north side of the property, connects the property to the Grierson-Sproul House at the west end of the avenue and to the Jeff Davis County Courthouse at the east end, both of which are listed on the NRHP. Fort Davis National Historic Site is located nearby at the north end of town. The central main house dominates the property and has a frontal facade facing eastward toward Madrone St. The house is adjacent to a large, rocky outcrop on the north, and along the western edge of the outcrop are located a windmill, a cistern and pump house, and a water storage tank. To the south of the main house runs an unpaved drive beginning at Madrone St. that passes through and around a porte-coch√®re physically separate from the house's south approach, and then veers southward to Woodward Ave. southwest of the house. An additional drive branches northward passing in front of the house's main entrance on the east and then doubles back to Madrone St. The main house with its porte-coch√®re along with the windmill, cistern and pump house, and tank are considered contributing resources to the property's NRHP designation. Non-contributing buildings on the property include a guest house located west of the main house near the western property boundary and a garage near the southwest corner. Other non- contributing structures consist of a gazebo with accompanying piazza near a stone play house southwest of the main house, and stone retaining walls or fencing located within and around portions of the property. Other listed non- contributing objects include a flagpole in the yard in front of the main house and a former sign at the northeast corner of the property. thumb The Trueheart House is an approximately Queen Anne style residence sitting atop a foundation and support walls made of native stone with sand and lime mortar upholding double-brick plastered adobe walls which hold deep openings for imported milled wood-frame doors, windows, and roofing. Two chimneys vent four fireplaces within the house. The eastward-facing frontal facade features a northeast bedroom extending outward from the rest of the home's interior. At the southeast corner of the home is a circular balcony above a round exterior turret. The balcony extends into a central veranda ending at the wall of the northeast bedroom, accessed by a stairway directly across from the main entrance to the house from a sidewalk across the front lawn accessed from an additional stairway leading from the street. Around the corner of from the veranda on the circular balcony, a stairway descends nearly to a stone patio between the house and the porte-coch√®re, which itself has steps leading to the drive. A series of planters behind a stone retaining wall extend from the porte-coch√®re to the southwest corner of the house. The veranda is elevated above the ground due to the slope of the surrounding property. The front roofing features a gable over the northeast bedroom, a larger gable over the veranda, and a conical, shingled \\"Chinese\\" cupola over the turret. The back of the house features a stone porch outside the kitchen with doorways to the kitchen and northwest bedroom as well as steps leading to ground level on the south beyond the boulder field. The landscaping, in addition to ambient wildflowers and cactus among the rocky outcrop, include elm, pine, and junipers in the front which largely obscure the frontal elevation, and a hackberry tree in the back. Shrubbery and ground cover have also been cultivated around the home. At the main entrance are central double doors surrounded by a transom window and sidelights with doors and windows featuring leaded stained glass. Interior walls are composed of plastered adobe. The entrance opens into a foyer effectively serving as a parlor with a fireplace in the northwest corner which shares a chimney with fireplaces in both of the northern bedrooms. The foyer has doorways leading to the northeast bedroom and the great room on the southeast side of the house and has a portal opposite the entrance leading to the dining room. The great room has a window overlooking the veranda and balcony to the east, and windows to the south with views that include the porte-coch√®re, stone patio, and toward the southwest of the property and beyond. The great room has additional doorways leading to the dining room and the southwest bedroom, and it has a fireplace that shares the same chimney as one in the southwest bedroom. The southwest bedroom has a south-facing window, a doorway to the kitchen, and a separate bathroom at the southwest corner of the house with closet space and windows facing south and west. The kitchen has a double doorway leading into the dining room and a door leading to the back porch on the room's southwest corner. The kitchen has bay windows overlooking the porch, a pantry closet in the room's southeastern corner, and features a late-19th to early 20th Century cast iron gas stove. The sink is in the northeast corner with food preparation counters extending from there around the room's northwestern corner. The dining room, in addition to the above-mentioned portals, also has a doorway leading to the central bedroom on the house's north side and a portal into a hallway leading to a common bathroom and the northwestern bedroom. The northwest bedroom, accessed by the hallway from the interior of the house, also has a doorway leading to the back stone porch adjacent to the kitchen. This bedroom has windows facing north and west overlooking the boulder field. The northwest bedroom shares a common bathroom off the hallway that has a north-facing window. The northeast bedroom has windows facing the north and east, but is walled-off from the adjoining veranda. The flanking rooms hold ceilings, and some of the rooms on the north side still retain their original wood beaded-ceiling planks. Between the two north bedrooms are bathrooms for each as well as closets. Both north bedrooms also have private living room space. On the eastern end of the house's south facing is a tall unattached porte-coch√®re with elaborate stone paving and a landscaped landing at ground level. On the west end of the porte- coch√®re, steps lead from ground level to an adjacent stone patio, while further steps ascend to the southeastern balcony and front entrance from the veranda. The porte-coch√®re retains original iron rings for tying carriage horses. A doorway from the stone patio leads to a basement underneath the house's great room with an adjacent basement-level workshop through an additional door underneath the southeast balcony and southern portion of the veranda. In addition to the main house and porte-coch√®re, other contributing structures to the site's NRHP designation include the water-pumping and storage infrastructure on the west side of the boulder field dominating the home's northern exterior. These include an Aermotor windmill along with a stone pump house and cistern that originally served the house and gardens. A nearby large, square water storage tank constructed of stone integrates well into the adjacent boulder formation. The property's non-contributing features include the guest house, approximately west of the main house. This adobe structure includes a living room with a fireplace, kitchen, a full bath, and laundry space. The exterior of the guest home holds two shaded patios. At the southwest corner of the property along the Woodward Ave. entrance and south of the guest house is a garage. A piazza constructed of native stone lies south of the main house and is adjacent to a wooden gazebo which together are shaded by a large hackberry tree as well as other smaller trees and vines. To the northwest of the piazza/gazebo combination is a small, round playhouse constructed of stone with a wooden roof. Native stone and mortar retaining walls as well as walls and fencing enclose the property and separate different portions of the lawn and gardens within the property. A flag pole is located in the front yard of the main house while a sign, dating to the house's previous function as a museum, is also listed as a non-contributing structure although it has since been removed.

FCC is the 2016 court case in which the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the Federal Communication Commission's reclassification of broadband services as telecommunications services subject to common carrier regulation under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This decision was a major victory for net neutrality, the principle of non-discrimination by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) with regards to data that they carry. The court upheld a set of Open Internet rules adopted by the FCC: bans on blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization of Internet traffic, a \\"General Conduct Rule\\" prohibiting broadband providers from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging \\"(i) end users' ability to select, access, and use broadband Internet access service or the lawful Internet content, applications, services, or devices of their choice, or (ii) edge providers' ability to make lawful content, applications, services, or devices available to end users,\\" and an enhanced set of transparency requirements.  History  The 2014 D.C. Circuit court decision Verizon v. FCC vacated portions of the FCC Open Internet Order 2010 because it was determined that they could only apply to common carriers. At the time, broadband services had historically been classified as \\"information services,\\" a decision made by the FCC in the early 2000s and unsuccessfully challenged in court. The FCC followed the advice of the Verizon court and sought to reclassify broadband services as \\"telecommunications services,\\" giving broadband status as a \\"common carrier\\" under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. Application of certain sections of Title II, particularly 201 and 202, prohibiting \\"unjust or unreasonable discrimination\\" by common carriers, allowed the erection of the FCC's regulatory schemes.  Ruling  The court ruled 2-1 in favor of the FCC's reclassification of broadband as a \\"telecommunications service,\\" with Judges Tatel and Srinivasan in the majority and Judge Williams dissenting in part. In its review of the appropriateness of reclassification, the court applied Chevron's two-step test to determine (1) whether the Communications Act is ambiguous with respect to the classification of broadband, and, if so, (2) whether the FCC's decision to reclassify was reasonable. In Judge Williams' dissent, he called the FCC's reasoning \\"self-contradictory\\" and said the justification for reclassification \\"fails for want of reasoned decisionmaking.\\" Several of the telecom groups petitioned the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari following the Court of Appeals ruling, ultimately falling under the case name Berninger v. Federal Communications Commission (Docket 17-489). The petition argued that the FCC did not have the power to issue the Open Internet Order, which required a re-interpretation of the Communications Act of 1934, under the Chevron deference. On November 5, 2018, seven members of the Court denied the petition, leaving in place the Court of Appeals ruling, which established that the FCC had the ability to reclassify Internet under Title I. Chief Justice John Roberts abstained due to financial conflict, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh abstained due to his previous involvement with the case history. Three Justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch had recommended accepting the petition as to order a Munsingwear vacatur, in which the Appeals Court order would have been vacated, returned to that court, and have the case rendered moot due to the more recent 2018 FCC order that reversed the Open Internet Order.  Impact  The decision was a major victory for net neutrality, which had the support of FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and the Obama administration.

The work was commissioned by the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and composed between July 27, 1997 and April 1998. It was composed for the violinist Jaime Laredo and the cellist Sharon Robinson, who first performed the piece with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra conducted by Raymond Leppard in Indianapolis on October 15, 1998. Composition=Background Rorem had known and worked with the cellist Sharon Robinson and the violinist Jaime Laredo for many years. In 1980, Rorem had composed his suite After Reading Shakespeare specifically for Sharon Robinson. Likewise, he had composed his 1984 Violin Concerto for Jaime Laredo. Thus, when Rorem received a commission from the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, he used the opportunity to write a double concerto for the two soloists. Rorem described his intent for the piece in the score program notes, writing: Structure The work has a duration of roughly 35 minutes and is cast in eight movements: #Morning #Adam and Eve #Mazurka #Staying on Alone #Their Accord #Looking #Conversation at Midnight #Flight Instrumentation The work is scored for solo violin and cello and a small orchestra comprising two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, and strings. In the score program notes, Rorem commented on the meek instrumentation, remarking, \\"The scoring is plain: only eight winds, four brass, and strings. No glamorous harps, keyboards, or mallets, and no percussion, none. (In growing older I've come to feel that percussion is, at best, mere decoration, at worst, immoral, like too many earrings or too many exclamation points!!)\\" Reception Reviewing a recording of the work, Peter Dickinson of Gramophone wrote: Recording A recording of the work, performed by Laredo, Robinson, and the IRIS Orchestra under the direction of Michael Stern, was released through Naxos Records in December 2006.

Prior to its official air date, it was launched in a streaming format on November 1, 2016. It blends elements of real interviews with a fictional story of a group of astronauts as they land on the planet Mars. The series is based on the 2015 book How We'll Live on Mars by Stephen Petranek. The fictional narrative alternates initially between the years 2016 and 2033, using present day non-fiction interviews to explain events unfolding in the story. The series was filmed in Budapest and Morocco. A companion book to the series, called Mars: Our Future on the Red Planet, was published in October 2016 detailing the science behind the show. A prequel episode, called Before Mars, was produced and released conjointly with the series. It tells the fictional story of a moment in the life of one of the astronauts, and the decisions she made to get involved in science. On January 13, 2017, it was announced that National Geographic had renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on November 12, 2018. The lead actress Jihae confirmed that the series was cancelled after only two seasons on her official Instagram.

During the descent into the Martian atmosphere, there is a malfunction with their spacecraft, the Daedalus. They land 75.3 kilometres away from their planned habitat. On Earth their progress is being monitored. In the second season, the story jumps ahead several years into the future after the Daedalus astronauts have built a full- fledged colony called Olympus Town. Having established humankind as an interplanetary species, Season 2 examines the impact that humans have on the Red Planet and the consequences the planet has on us. Intermixed with the story are real-life interview footage from the present, of the crew, and their mission control; there are interviews with various public figures, including scientists and engineers, such as Elon Musk, Susan Wise Bauer, Andy Weir, Robert Zubrin, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, about the difficulties that the crew might face on a journey to, and living on, Mars.

ECES promotes sustainable democratic development through the provision of advisory services, operational support to electoral stakeholders, such as electoral management bodies, civil society organizations (active in the field of civic and voter education and election observation), political parties, parliaments, media, security forces and electoral dispute resolutions bodies. ECES‚Äô President is Monica Frassoni, a former Member of the EU Parliament, presently the Co-Chair of the European Green Party and twice Chief Observer for the EU Election Observation Missions (Venezuela and Bolivia, both in 2006) appointed by the former EU Commissioner for External Relations, Ferrero-Waldner. Jos√© Manuel Pinto-Teixeira is ECES‚Äô Vice President. He is a former high-level EU Official who served as Ambassador of the EU/ Head of Delegation in several countries, including: Cabo Verde, Ukraine, Belarus, Mozambique and Macedonia. ECES' Executive Director is Fabio Bargiacchi, one of the most prominent senior experts in the field of electoral support funded by European Union. In addition to being one of the co-founders of ECES, he is also part of ECES Management Board. Prior to his involvement with ECES he was at the forefront of the establishment of the Partnership between the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on electoral assistance and the Coordinator of the dedicated Joint EC UNDP Task Force.  History  ECES was established in September 2010 and launched in December of the same year when Abbot Apollinaire Mulhongo Malu Malu, the first President of ECES management board, was invited by the European Commission European Commission to attend the European Development Days in Brussels. During this occasion, the creation of ECES was announced. A shared ideal for a European not-for-profit electoral support ''' ECES emerged as an idea of a European not-for-profit foundation specialized in electoral support much long before being officially launched in 2010. The initiative came from Fabio Bargiacchi back in 1997, when he participated in an electoral supervision mission in Bosnia for the Organisation for the Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). There, he realised that the USA were funding American foundations and organisations dedicated to implementing electoral assistance via an established cooperative agreement since 1995, known as the CEPPS (the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening that still exists and comprise three not-for-profit organisations: the International Foundation for Electoral System, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republic Institute) . The EU and/or the EU member states however, did not have such organisations but were instead funding other international organisations such as the OSCE and the United Nations. Since then Fabio Bargiacchi worked exclusively on the electoral support sector again with the OSCE but mainly for the EU and the UNDP where from 2004 to 2010 he contributed to establish the strategic partnership between the EU and UNDP on electoral assistance including its dedicated Joint EC UNDP Task Force for which he was the coordinator from the UNDP Brussels office. Taking on board all these experiences he went on to fulfill his dream of establishing a European based not-for-profit foundation to provide an alternative delivery mechanism embodying the views and values of the EU and EU Member States as donors in favour of the electoral stakeholders of the beneficiaries' countries of their development cooperation. In July 2011, Fabio Bargiacchi was entrusted by the members of ECES management board to lead the organisation‚Äôs management unit as its Executive Director. The same year, Monica Frassoni was appointed as Vice President of ECES of which she later took over the Presidency, when Abbot Malu Malu resigned due to commitments in his home country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and to health reasons that unfortunately costed his life a few years later. 10 years of achievements ''' Despite having been launched at the end of 2010, ECES embarked on its first real large endeavour at the beginning of 2012 by delivering face-to-face and distance training to the electoral management bodies of the ten countries being members of the ECCAS (Economic Community of Central African States). The same year ECES was also awarded its first EU funded project to support the local elections in post-revolution Libya. Ten years down the line, ECES is now a well-established foundation that is proud of its roots and the course it has taken. It has overcome many challenges and boasts numerous milestone achievements. Our quest to deliver electoral assistance worldwide while promoting European values through a European distinct delivery mechanism is constantly growing. As such, ECES is committed to continuing contributing to democratic and electoral processes around the world and, together with the United Nations Development Programme and International IDEA, nowadays is one of the three most important partners of the EU for the implementation of EU funded electoral support. ECES area of expertise  Vision, Mission and Quality Policy  ECES‚Äô work focuses on: * Electoral and democracy support * Creation of synergies between election observation and electoral assistance programmes * Support of knowledge development in electoral administration * Developing leadership and conflict management skills for different electoral stakeholders through training and advisory services *Capacity building, cooperation, peer reviews and exchange of experiences in a South-South perspective. ECES' vision is to continue to be the reference not-for-profit private European organisation to implement electoral support projects in line with the values and policies of the European Union and its Member states in the context of their development cooperation with their partner countries. ECES strives to support the partner countries of the EU and of its Member States to organise their electoral processes in a credible and transparent manner as the best contribution to prevent electoral conflicts and to promote stability toward inclusiveness and fair societies. ECES' mission as a not-for- profit foundation is to work de facto as an association of electoral and EU project management experts implementing electoral support activities via copyrighted tools and methodologies resumed in our strategy called ‚ÄúA European Response to Electoral Cycle Support - EURECS‚Äù. ECES' quality policy is to be fully committed to the continuous improvement in the quality of ECES and our activities in implementing our EURECS copyrighted strategy. All the personnel working at ECES are aware of their crucial contribution to the achievement of our objectives through compliance with the necessary process, service, legal and regulatory requirements, always taking into consideration the needs of our donors and beneficiaries. We will continue to aim for the highest standards of professionalism in our operations and will work to ensure the satisfaction of our personnel, partners, donors and beneficiaries worldwide.  Collaborations  In addition to its experts and in-country teams, ECES also collaborates closely with several regional organisations and electoral networks, such as: African Union, ECOWAS, ECCAS, CEN-SAD, the RECEF (the Electoral Knowledge Network of the French Speaking countries worldwide), the EPLO (European Peacebuilding Liaison Office), the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) the ECF-SADC (Electoral Commission Forum of the Southern African Development Community), the ECONEC (Network of Electoral Commissions), the National Electoral Commissions of ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States), the Electoral Knowledge Network of the Central African States (RESEAC) and the SADC Electoral Support Network that comprises the platforms of the Civil Society Organisations dealing with Election Observation in the SADC countries. ECES developed a partnership with the Sant‚ÄôAnna School of Advanced Studies of Pisa Sant‚ÄôAnna School of Advanced Studies, a world ranked university, to promote customised, accessible and innovative capacity building programmes for all electoral stakeholders, including the Master on Electoral Policy and Administration ‚Äì MEPA. The ECES-SSSA's partnership facilitates the enrollment of EMB representatives and election practitioners in MEPA or in one of its 19 modules, structured around the Electoral Cycle Approach. ECES is also part of a consortium led by the College of Europe to implement the ERMES project (European Response on Mediation Support) to provide a tool for the EU to advance its objectives and role in the field of mediation and dialogue. The project is implemented under the supervision of the Service for Foreign Policy Instruments of the European Commission and in close consultation with the Mediation Support Team of the European External Action Services which will ensure the political steer. ECES is also member of the Federation of European and International Association established in Belgium (FAIB) and is part of the EU Transparency Register and the Transnational Giving Europe Network. In collaboration with European Partnership for Democracy (EPD) , ECES conceived a joint strategy called ‚ÄúEuropean Response to Electoral Cycle Support-EURECS‚Äù, an aid delivery mechanism devised to implement electoral and democracy assistance activities in line with European values and policies and consistent with the recommendations formulated by EU Electoral Observation Missions. ECES works together with the International Electoral Accreditation Body (IEAB) and the Organisation of American States (OAS) in order to spread the knowledge and comprehension of electoral standards of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and to assist electoral management bodies worldwide.  Key activities  ECES is specialised in effective handling of the very complex and delicate set of interactions among the electoral management bodies, multilateral and bilateral development agencies, governments, CSOs, political parties, and providers of electoral material and services by implementing the following set of activities: *Management of basket funds (EU and other donors): through the adoption of transparent management procedures in line with ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù of the sector, ECES is able to maximise the coherence and the complementarity of external contributions to the electoral processes in view to avoid duplication of efforts. *Political dialogue: strengthening and consolidating electoral stakeholders‚Äô commitments and adherence to common and shared democratic values. *Crisis management/mediation process with key electoral stakeholders including political leaders: support various local forums, such as a panel of influential persons; including nationals and senior mediation and conflict management experts who can advise and support the panel. *Link existing peace-building projects to early warning mechanisms: this activity seeks to tap into already ongoing local initiatives along these lines that need strengthened coordination to enhance effectiveness. *Religious networks and association mapping and inter- and intra-faith dialogue, with potential to counteract extremism and radicalisation: inter-and intra-faith dialogue has the potential to deal effectively with political and electoral challenges and contribute to the progress of democratisation and peaceful conduct of elections in ways that will give meaning and direction to followers of different faiths, anchored in religious guidance. *Confidence-building dialogue initiatives (regional, national and community level): such activities can contribute to strengthening and consolidating a wide range of electoral stakeholders‚Äô commitments and adherence to common and shared democratic values. *Advisory support: provision of specific, high quality, flexible and customisable electoral expertise in view to develop appropriate and effective answers to the needs of national authorities and electoral stakeholders; *Logistics and operational support: evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the logistic and operational electoral chain is a require for improvement in terms of effectiveness, timing, cost, sustainability, while providing support to logistic operations (inventory, electoral kit, deployment and storage of electoral material, etc.). *Media monitoring and institutional communication: media monitoring, which consists of observing media contents using quantitative and qualitative analysis in the long run, is essential to evaluate the media coverage of the electoral process, media pluralism and citizens‚Äô perception of the Electoral *Management Bodies (EMB) and the electoral process. *Procurement of electoral material: development of acquisition plans on behalf of donors and in full compliance with the procedures and technical specifications, which allows to identify the needs that develop the most appropriate management methodology and chronogram taking into account the challenges related to the electoral calendar; *Support EMBs to enhance their capacity to manage donors‚Äô funds including reporting and procedures and expending evaluation: fully in accordance with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Busan Partnership, ECES, while ensuring the transparency and traceability of funds‚Äô usage, support beneficiaries to become fully autonomous in managing financial contributions. *Development of innovative information and communication technologies (ICTs), user-friendly solutions and applications adapted to electoral support: technology can be a strategic asset for supporting electoral assistance related activities. *Implementation of civic-voter education campaigns: ECES designs and implements civic and voter education activities for different electoral stakeholders, particularly for electoral management bodies and CSOs. This is done using innovative tools, such as production of videos and using media monitoring and social network and implementing nation wide mobile cinema campaigns. *Design and securitisation of ballot papers: several studies demonstrated that the order of candidates, typography and layout such as the presence of logos and photos are not neutral ballot paper‚Äôs elements. In order to ensure a fair and equal treatment to all candidates, a digital processing of candidates and political parties logos allow standardising the presentation in line with common rules (background, colours, and templates). *Transmission of election results: support the design and implementation of transparent, effective and credible results transmission systems, which can contribute to the facilitation of acceptance of results while reducing the risk of accidents and violence; *Production of visibility plans: ECES for each and every single project produces visibility plan according to the rules and regulations of each donor, which is submitted to approval before it is implemented. This includes design and publishing of dedicated websites and social network activities.  Trainings and Capacity Development  Capacity development is one of ECES‚Äô main fields of expertise. ECES believes that dissemination of knowledge and sharing of lessons learned among diverse electoral stakeholders and practitioners establishes a fertile growing ground for further systematised exchange between stakeholders that otherwise only interacts ad-hoc. To this aim, ECES delivers courses both in the framework of its projects and as open enrolment courses. ECES organises the following training programmes: *Master in Electoral Policy and Administration; *Leadership and Conflict Management Skills for Electoral Stakeholders (LEAD) training in collaboration with the Centre for Creative Leadership and delivered in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Arabic *Leadership and Quality Management Skills for Electoral Administratoors (LEAD-Q) trainings; *Effective Electoral Assistance trainings; *Building Resources in Democracy, Governance and Elections (BRIDGE) training ; *Training on the Steps of the Electoral Cycle; *ISO Certification process; *Other training programmes.  International certifications  In July 2020, ECES received the official ISO accreditation for its yearlong efforts in implementing the ISO 9001:2015 for the improvement of its quality management system. The certification was awarded by European Quality Assurance (EQA), as a testimony to ECES abidance by the highest international standards for quality management. In May 2020, ECES officially received the TRACEcertification , hereby reinforcing its status as an organisation of excellence and reliable partner for companies and organisations around the world. Certification by TRACE signifies that ECES has completed internationally accepted due diligence procedures and has been forthcoming and cooperative during the review process. The successful completion of TRACEcertification demonstrates ECES' commitment to commercial and financial transparency, allowing us to serve as a valued partner to multinational organisations and companies.

Their description was as follows: \\"Subiculum bright yellow, thin; hymenium immarginate pallid, or yellow tinged with tawny.\\" Crustodontia has a monomitic hyphal system, meaning it contains only generative hyphae, and these hyphae have clamp connections. Crustodontia chrysocreas has a pantropical distribution. It has been widely collected, including the United States, Costa Rica, Caribbean Islands, Venezuela, equatorial Africa, Sri Lanka, China, Taiwan, Japan, Hawaii, Brunei, western Australia, and New Zealand. It is rare in Europe; its northernmost recorded collection location (51.7¬∞N) is in Belarus. The fungus causes a white rot in the woody debris of live oak and other hardwoods; it also causes white heart rot in living trees. Crustodontia is closely related to Phlebia. Molecular analysis places it in the Meruliaceae, in the phlebioid clade.

They were the first RUC officers to be killed by republicans during the Troubles and the first security forces to be killed in South Armagh, an IRA stronghold for much of the conflict. Background The conflict known as Troubles had started a year earlier in August 1969 with the Battle of the Bogside followed by the August 1969 riots. The first RUC officer to be killed in the conflict was Victor Arbuckle (29). He was shot dead by members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) on 12 October 1969, during street violence in the Shankill area of Belfast. The loyalists \\"had taken to the streets in protest at the Hunt Report, which recommended the disbandment of the B Specials and disarming of the RUC\\".McKittrick, David.

Unknown to the officers, the car contained a booby-trap bomb, made up of 20 lb (9.1 kg) of gelignite. It exploded when one of the officers attempted to open one of the car doors, badly wounding them and blowing them over a hedge. The blast was heard from Crossmaglen RUC station. The officers died of their wounds the next day. They were the first members of the security forces to be killed by republicans during the conflict.McKittrick, pp.56-57. The car had been stolen outside the Ardmore Hotel in Newry on 7 August. The action was planned and executed by an active service unit made up of IRA members from Navan, County Meath and Inniskeen, County Monaghan, both in the Republic of Ireland. The group was led by high-profile republican Se√°n Mac St√≠of√°in. Aftermath The next killing of a member of the British security forces was in February 1971, when the IRA shot dead Gunner Robert Curtis in Belfast. Curtis was the first British soldier to be killed in the Troubles. Crossmaglen would become an Irish republican stronghold and the Provisional IRA carried at many attacks on the British security forces there during the course of the conflict.

For the 2015 season, he played for Tabuan Muda in preparation for the 28th SEA Games held in Singapore. Wijaya FC signed him at the beginning of the 2016 season. Suhaimi transferred to Panchor Murai FC of the Brunei Premier League in 2017. He scored his first goal against IKLS FC on 14 May. At the conclusion of the Premier League season, he moved to Indera SC for the remaining matches of the 2017 Brunei Super League. He scored his first goal for Indera against former team Wijaya FC on 3 February 2018. In early February 2018, Brunei's professional club DPMM FC announced the signing of Suhaimi on their website, alongside Haimie Anak Nyaring, Abdul Hariz Herman and Abdul Azizi Ali Rahman. He officially signed to terms on 13 February. Under Brazilian coach Rene Weber, he made his debut on 7 April at left-back in a 4‚Äì2 victory against Home United. He swiftly became Weber's first-choice left-back in the team, earning plaudits for his strength in that position. Suhaimi scored his first goal for DPMM in a 2‚Äì2 draw at home against Balestier Khalsa on 7 July 2018. International career Suhaimi's first involvement with the national team setup was at the 2013 AFF U-19 Youth Championship held in Indonesia, where Brunei spearheaded by 15-year-old Prince Faiq Bolkiah conceded 30 goals in 5 matches to finish rock bottom of their group.

It profoundly elected the 10th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It was held in Beijing, China, between August 24‚Äì28, 1973. The congress was attended by 1249 people which represented 28 million party members across China. It was preceded by the 9th National Congress. It was ultimately succeeded by the 11th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.  Details of the Congress  On 20 August 1973, prior to the start of the congress, the Politburo of the Communist Party of China adopted a resolution to suspend the party memberships of Lin Biao, Ye Qun, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Li Zuopeng and Qiu Huizuo indefinitely. The congress was opened on 24 August, with Mao Zedong presiding over the meeting, Zhou Enlai delivering the political report and Wang Hongwen reporting regarding the revision of the Constitution. Mao and Zhou suggested the political rehabilitation of 13 old guard members such as Tan Zhenlin and Li Jingquan. The 10th Congress affirmed the revised Constitution of the Communist Party of China that was also adopted by the 9th national congress. It stipulated some adjustments in the structure but the provisions of the section is not much changed, such as the guiding ideology and the basic principles of the party. In the edited bill, only discussions and doctrines proposed or related to Lin Biao were removed. The 10th congress elected 195 Central Committee members and 124 alternate members, with the Gang of Four taking key roles within the central committee and the rehabilitation of politicians persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, which included Li Zuopeng, Deng Xiaoping, Wang Jiaxiang and others. Significance of the Congress= New power structure  The fall of Lin Biao and his cohorts in 1971 left many vacant posts in the party and the government. Of the 21-man Politburo only 10 were left and of its five-man Standing Committee, only three ‚Äì Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Kang Sheng ‚Äì were still present. Therefore, the 10th congress convened to elect new members to the unoccupied positions and to condemn the actions of Lin Biao as a right opportunist who \\"waved the red flag to defeat the red flag\\". During the congress, the Gang of Four managed to secure positions with the support from Mao. Jiang Qing and Yao Wenyuan were elected to the Poliburo, Zhang Chunqiao to the Standing Committee and Wang Hongwen as the party's second vice-chairman.  Continuation of the Cultural Revolution  Wang Hongwen in his debut keynote address during the congress announced the smashing of the \\"two bourgeois headquarters, the one headed by Liu Shaoqi and the other by Lin Biao\\". Thus he turned the Cultural Revolution into an ongoing process that would last into the future, for in the words of Mao, every seven or eight years a great disaster was inevitable to class nature. Wang stressed the revolutionary spirit of daring to go against the tide and the importance of training young leaders. With the future of the country in the hands of the young, struggle and continued revolution would punctuate Chinese political life.

The municipality was proclaimed on 29 June 1876 following the necessary petition of residents in the townships of Aberdeen, Kooringa and Redruth, severing the area from the new District Council of Burra. It was divided into three wards at its inception: North Ward, Middle Ward and South Ward (North, East, and West Wards from 1884). The proclamation named Philip Lane as the first mayor, and George Sara and August Bartholomaus (North Ward), Robert Sanders and Edward Lipsett (Middle Ward), and Joseph Roberts and John Snell (South Ward) as the first councillors. It met for the first time on 10 July, and established a council chamber in the Burra Institute. The creation of the Burra corporation followed an unsuccessful attempt in 1875 by the residents of the northern townships of Aberdeen and Redruth to form their own corporation. The municipality used a shaft of the Bon Accord mine as its water supply from 1884 to 1905. In 1911, the council initiated a public fund for the construction of the historic Market Square Rotunda in honour of King Edward VII. In 1945, the committee of the Burra Institute transferred the building to the council, which renamed it the Burra Town Hall and began screening films in the hall to pay down the debt.

With a combined installed capacity of , the system is the third largest pumped-storage power station in Japan. The facilities are run by Electric Power Development Company (J-Power). Like most pumped-storage facilities, the power station uses two reservoirs, releasing and pumping as the demand rises and falls. Tashiro lake, formed by the Kassa Dam, is the upper artificial reservoir, while Futai Dam on the Kiyotsu river forms the lower reservoir. Both dams are rockfill type dams, with a height of 90 m and 87 m, respectively. The reservoirs were built between 1972 and 1978. Okukiyotsu No. 1 is the first plant to be built on the site, and employs four 260 MW pump/generator units, for a total net capacity of 1000 MW. The maximum water flow is 260 cubic meters per second. Construction on the plant started in 1972 and it became operational between 1978 and 1982. Okukiyotsu No. 2 is a later addition to the site. The plant is composed of two adjustable speed pump/generator units for a combined power capacity of 600 MW and a maximum water flow of 154 cubic meters per second. Adjustable speed units allow for a rapid variation of power levels during both pumping and generation. These were the highest hydraulic head adjustable speed units in the world. Construction of the second plant started in 1992 and it became operational in 1996. Both plants have an effective head of 470 m.

In the late stages of development, the director decided to rename it to \\"Tram Number 8.\\" * Filming started in 1999 but was suspended until November 2001. * Due to these changes in timing, the director had to condense the filming from the original 8‚Äì9 months to 5 months. * Recording costed about 80,000 UAH (US$15,000), funded largely from a presidential grant issued to Stepan Koval in 1998. * The authors did not have time to create subtitles, so the tape was provided without them at the Berlin Film Festival. However, it was very well received by the public. * The film won a 'Special Mention' award from the 2003 FANTOCHE awards.  Plot  The film tells about a familiar situation: a morning tram filled with passengers, which people are trying to catch to get to work. Children, seniors, a young family and neighbours are discussing the show. This is what the average Ukrainian experiences on his way to work, as the transport situation shows. The situation is shown in an interesting, bright and witty way. The film uses a Plasticine animation technique to portray these events intelligently.

(formerly known as Atieva) is an American automotive company specializing in electric cars. The company was founded in 2007, and is based in Newark, California. History Lucid was founded in 2007 under the name Atieva and originally focused on building electric vehicle batteries and powertrains for other vehicle manufacturers. Some of Lucid's 500 employees had previously worked at other car companies such as Tesla and Mazda, including Peter Rawlinson, the former VP of Engineering at Tesla, and Derek Jenkins, the former Head of Design at Mazda North America Operations. The company has seen investments from Tsing Capital, Mitsui, Venrock, JAFCO, and others, providing an estimated US$131 million by 2016. Venrock, Mitsui, and JAFCO are still current investors in the company. The company rebranded to Lucid Motors in October 2016 and officially announced its intent to develop an all-electric, high-performance luxury vehicle. On November 29, 2016, state and company officials announced the planned construction of Lucid's US$700 million manufacturing plant in Casa Grande, Arizona, which was projected to employ up to 2,000 workers by the mid-2020s, initially building 20,000 cars and expanding up to 130,000 cars per year. The factory was then to be designed to support a maximum capacity of 380,000 cars per year. , the company had planned to break ground in 2017, and have cars in production by early 2019. On September 17, 2018, Lucid Motors announced that they were in talks with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia for a funding valued at over $1 billion. The investment was completed in April 2019. The investment will fund: the final engineering and testing of the Lucid Air model; the first-phase construction of its manufacturing plant in Casa Grande, Arizona; the commercial production of the Lucid Air; and Lucid's worldwide retail strategy, beginning in North America. Construction of the plant began in late 2019. Vehicles Lucid mainly developed battery technology in its early years, but began development of its first car in 2014. Development prototype The company initially used a Mercedes Metris van, named ‚ÄúEdna‚Äù, to develop the powertrain.  Lucid Air  A prototype of the Lucid Air fully electric car was unveiled in December 2016,Lucid Motors debuts luxury EV set to take on Tesla and was designed with a front motor and a rear motor for a combined . Lucid unveiled the production version of the car in September 2020, and announced that production will begin in spring 2021. Lucid has agreed with Mobileye to use their EyeQ4 chips and 8 cameras for driver assist features, and will make the car \\"autonomous ready\\". This 4-door sedan is able to reach a software-limited top speed of . In July 2017, running on the high-speed track at the Transportation Research Center in Ohio, a special version of the car (with the speed limiter disabled via software and other modifications) hit . Lucid originally planned to start production in 2020, but at the production unveil in September 2020 announced a delay to spring 2021. On June 30, 2020, Lucid announced that its \\"electric car will be the world's most aerodynamically efficient luxury car when it goes into production later this year.\\" The company \\"achieved a new benchmark in aerodynamic efficiency‚Ä¶ with tests recently completed at WindShear's advanced rolling-road wind tunnel, the automaker verified a coefficient of drag of 0.21.\\" On August 11, 2020, it was announced that \\"The first all-electric car from Lucid Motors is expected to set a new industry benchmark ‚Äî and record,\\" with an estimated EPA range of on a single charge. Lucid is collaborating with Amazon to build in compatibility with Amazon's voice assistant Alexa, allowing drivers to use the voice assistant for navigation, phone calls, media streaming, smart home control and more while driving.  Project Gravity  Lucid unveiled an electric SUV concept in September 2020 called Project Gravity, but provided only a brief \\"glimpse of the future\\" and short video segment. Batteries Lucid's car uses the 2170 standard for its lithium-ion battery cells, and supply agreements have been signed with both Samsung SDI and LG Chem. Lucid has designed, developed, manufactured and supplied battery packs for all race teams in the 2018-19 Formula E season, and will continue to do so for the 2019-20 season, in collaboration with McLaren Applied Technologies and Sony.

He was exiled and discredited for killing, with his sword in a fit of rage, a man he considered was a blasphemer. In his exile he experienced a radical shift in tone that compelled him to lead a penitential life for others. Gallerani soon returned to Siena - after receiving permission to do so - and in 1240 founded both a hospital and the religious association \\"Frati della Misericordia\\" - this association later died out in 1308 and was thus suppressed.

While documenting the Rana Plaza collapse in 2013, she took a photograph of a woman and a man who had died in each other's arms, which became emblematic of the incident. Biography Taslima Akhter was born in Dhaka, in Bangladesh, in 1974. Akhter is a graduate of Dhaka University, with Master's degrees in science and in public administration. While at the university, she was a member of the Bangladesh Student's Federation. She went on the study photojournalism at Pathshala, a photography school in Dhaka, which was founded by Shahidul Alam. She tries to bring attention to social and environmental issues through her photography, driven partly by her experience during the 2008 political emergency in Bangladesh. Akhter was among those who documented the fire at Tasreen Garments factory in 2012. Akhter has worked on projects in several cities in Bangladesh, as well as in Nandigram in India. Her work led to her receiving the Magnum Foundation scholarship in 2010. Her work has been exhibited in several countries. Akhter is a member of the women's organization Biplobi Nari Sanghati and the leftist activist group Gana Sanghati Andolan. She is also a coordinator of the Garments Sramik Sangathan (garment worker's union). In addition, she teaches at Pathshala. Akhter's politics have an influence on her photography. \\"Final Embrace\\" Following the Rana Plaza collapse in April 2013, Akhter and other photographers from Pathshala tried to document the lives of people who had died there, while also taking part in the rescue effort. These stories were later published as a book, titled Chobbish April: Hazaar Praner Chitkar (24 April: outcries of a thousand souls). The publication was related to Akhter's work with the garment workers' union. During this process, Akhter photographed a man and woman who had died in the building collapse, locked in an embrace with each other. Akhter was unable to identify the subjects of the photograph despite much effort. This photograph, known variously as the \\"Eternal Embrace\\", the \\"Death of A Thousand Dreams\\", and the \\"Final Embrace\\", received widespread critical attention and multiple awards, and became emblematic of the incident, in which 1100 people died. The photograph also received widespread attention online, and led to petitions to clothing companies demanding higher minimum wages and improved safety standards.

Produced by Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment, Judwaa 2 was released on 29 September 2017. Plot While flying back to Mumbai, Rajeev Malhotra meets Charles, a criminal. Malhotra then rushes to the hospital where his wife has given birth to Twin sons. The doctor explains that when the twins are near each other, their reflexes operate simultaneously. Malhotra has the authorities at the hospital waiting to arrest Charles. In the scuffle, Charles kidnaps one of the twins and leaves him at the train tracks. Charles is arrested and is sentenced to twenty years in prison. The police advises Malhotra to take his wife and Prem and leave India, so they move to London, England. The other twin is found by a woman named Kashibai and she raises him as her son in Mumbai, and names him Raja. Twenty years later, Charles is almost about to be released from jail. Prem has grown up to be a kind and gentle Christian boy who aspires to be a musician. He is thrashed and bullied by an upperclassman, Rocky, on his first day of college and is pitied by Samaira. Samaira is impressed by Prem's musical talents and asks him to come to her house and teach her music. At the same time, Raja has grown up to be a fun-loving young man and staunch devotee of Ganpati Bappa, growing alongside his friend Nandu in the slums. One day, he gets in brawl with Alex, a local goon's head, at the festivities for Ganesh Chaturti. Raja is warned to take Nandu and get out of India for a few days because Alex's goons will go after them. Raja and Nandu illegally fly to London and meet Alishka on the flight. Raja starts dating Alishka and Prem begins dating Samaira. Now that Raja and Prem are both in London and are in close proximity to each other, their reflexes start operating simultaneously, and this creates a lot of confusion for the both of them and their girlfriends. They are also mistaken for each other by many people in the city. One day, after Raja and Nandu save Malhotra from an accident, they find Alex and his uncle and discover that Alex lost his memory after that incident. Raja and Prem finally meet each other. They don't realize that they are twins and conclude that they only share the same face. Alex regains his memory and bring Raja and Nandu to Charles, who is Alex's dad. Charles holds Nandu hostage demanding Malhotra in exchange. Raja finally discovers that he and Prem are twins. Prem, disguised as Raja, brings Malhotra to Charles. Raja arrives and beats up all of his goons. Alex's uncle locks himself with Raja. But soon, Raja's reflexes reciprocate helping Prem beat Alex. Raja and Prem find their father tied to a bomb and later deactivate it after Raja's fluke. The Malhotra family is finally reunited and Prem marries Samaira while Raja marries Alishka.

It has applications in enumerative geometry, random matrix theory, mathematical physics, string theory, knot theory.  Introduction  The topological recursion is a construction in algebraic geometry.Invariants of algebraic curves and topological expansion, B. Eynard, N. Orantin, math- ph/0702045, ccsd-hal-00130963, Communications in Number Theory and Physics, Vol 1, Number 2, p347-452. It takes as initial data a spectral curve: the data of \\\\left(\\\\Sigma,\\\\Sigma_0,x,\\\\omega_{0,1},\\\\omega_{0,2}\\\\right), where: x:\\\\Sigma\\\\to\\\\Sigma_0 is a covering of Riemann surfaces with ramification points; \\\\omega_{0,1} is a meromorphic differential 1-form on \\\\Sigma, regular at the ramification points; \\\\omega_{0,2} is a symmetric meromorphic bilinear differential form on \\\\Sigma^2 having a double pole on the diagonal and no residue. The topological recursion is then a recursive definition of infinite sequences of symmetric meromorphic n-forms \\\\omega_{g,n} on \\\\Sigma^n, with poles at ramification points only, for integers g‚â•0 such that 2g-2+n>0. The definition is a recursion on the integer 2g-2+n. In many applications, the n-form \\\\omega_{g,n} is interpreted as a generating function that measures a set of surfaces of genus g and with n boundaries. The recursion is on 2-2g-n the Euler characteristics, whence the name \\"topological recursion\\". thumb  Origin  The topological recursion was first discovered in random matrices. One main goal of random matrix theory, is to find the large size asymptotic expansion of n-point correlation functions, and in some suitable cases, the asymptotic expansion takes the form of a power series. The n-form \\\\omega_{g,n} is then the gth coefficient in the asymptotic expansion of the n-point correlation function. It was foundB.

The idea to consider this universal recursion relation beyond random matrix theory, and to promote it as a definition of algebraic curves invariants, occurred in Eynard-Orantin 2007 who studied the main properties of those invariants. An important application of topological recursion was to Gromov-Witten invariants. Marino and BKMPVincent Bouchard, Albrecht Klemm, Marcos Marino, Sara Pasquetti, Remodeling the B-model, Commun.Math.Phys.287:117-178,2009 conjectured that Gromov-Witten invariants of a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold \\\\mathfrak X are the TR invariants of a spectral curve that is the mirror of \\\\mathfrak X. Since then, topological recursion has generated a lot of activity in particular in enumerative geometry. The link to Givental formalism and Frobenius manifolds has been established.P. Dunin-Barkowski, N. Orantin, S. Shadrin, L. Spitz, \\"Identification of the Givental formula with the spectral curve topological recursion procedure\\", Commun.Math.Phys. 328 (2014) 669-700.  Definition  (Case of simple branch points. For higher order branchpoints, see the section Higher order ramifications below) * For n\\\\geq 1 and 2g-2+n>0: \\\\omega_{g,n}(z_1,z_2,\\\\dots,z_{n})= \\\\sum_{a=\\\\text{branchpoints}} \\\\operatorname{Res}_{z\\\\to a} K(z_1,z,\\\\sigma_a(z)) \\\\Big( \\\\omega_{g-1,n+1}(z,\\\\sigma_a(z),z_2,\\\\dots,z_n) \\\\+ \\\\sum'_{\\\\overset{g_1+g_2=g}{I_1\\\\uplus I_2={z_2,\\\\dots,z_n} }} \\\\omega_{g_1,1+# I_1}(z,I_1)\\\\omega_{g_2,1+# I_2}(\\\\sigma_a(z),I_2) \\\\Big) where K(z_1,z_2,z_3) is called the recursion kernel: K(z_1,z_2,z_3) = \\\\frac{\\\\frac12 \\\\int_{z'=z_3}^{z_2} \\\\omega_{0,2}(z_1,z')}{\\\\omega_{0,1}(z_2)-\\\\omega_{0,1}(z_3)} and \\\\sigma_a is the local Galois involution near a branch point a, it is such that x(\\\\sigma_a(z))=x(z). The primed sum \\\\sum' means excluding the two terms (g_1,I_1)=(0,\\\\emptyset) and (g_2,I_2)=(0,\\\\emptyset). * For n=0 and 2g-2>0: F_g = \\\\omega_{g,0} = \\\\frac{1}{2-2g}\\\\ \\\\sum_{a=\\\\text{branchpoints}} \\\\operatorname{Res}_{z\\\\to a} F_{0,1}(z) \\\\omega_{g,1}(z) with dF_{0,1}=\\\\omega_{0,1} any antiderivative of \\\\omega_{0,1}. * The definition of F_0=\\\\omega_{0,0} and F_1=\\\\omega_{1,0} is more involved and can be found in the original article of Eynard-Orantin.  Main properties  * Symmetry: each \\\\omega_{g,n} is a symmetric n-form on \\\\Sigma^n. * poles: each \\\\omega_{g,n} is meromorphic, it has poles only at branchpoints, with vanishing residues. * Homogeneity: \\\\omega_{g,n} is homogeneous of degree 2-2g-n. Under the change \\\\omega_{0,1}\\\\to \\\\lambda \\\\omega_{0,1}, we have \\\\omega_{g,n}\\\\to \\\\lambda^{2-2g-n}\\\\omega_{g,n}. * Dilaton equation: \\\\sum_{a=\\\\text{branchpoints}} \\\\operatorname{Res}_{z\\\\to a} F_{0,1}(z)\\\\ \\\\omega_{g,n+1}(z_1,\\\\dots,z_n,z) = (2-2g-n) \\\\omega_{g,n}(z_1,\\\\dots,z_n) where dF_{0,1}=\\\\omega_{0,1}. * Loop equations: The following forms have no poles at branchpoints \\\\sum_{z\\\\in x^{-1}(x)} \\\\omega_{g,n+1}(z,z_1,\\\\dots,z_n) \\\\sum_{{z eq z'} \\\\subset x^{-1}(x)} \\\\Big(\\\\omega_{g,n+1}(z,z',z_2,\\\\dots,z_n) \\\\+ \\\\sum_{\\\\overset{g_1+g_2=g}{I_1\\\\uplus I_2={z_2,\\\\dots,z_n} }} \\\\omega_{g_1,1+# I_1}(z,I_1)\\\\omega_{g_2,1+# I_2}(z',I_2) \\\\Big) where the sum has no prime, i.e. no term excluded. * Deformations: The \\\\omega_{g,n} satisfy deformation equations * Limits: given a family of spectral curves \\\\mathcal S_t, whose limit as t\\\\to 0 is a singular curve, resolved by rescaling by a power of t^\\\\mu , then \\\\lim_{t\\\\to 0} t^{(2-2g-n)\\\\mu}\\\\omega_{g,n}(\\\\mathcal S_t) = \\\\omega_{g,n}(\\\\lim_{t\\\\to 0} t^\\\\mu \\\\mathcal S_t) . * Symplectic invariance: In the case where \\\\Sigma is a compact algebraic curve with a marking of a symplectic basis of cycles, x is meromorphic and \\\\omega_{0,1}=ydx is meromorphic and \\\\omega_{0,2}=B is the fundamental second kind differential normalized on the marking, then the spectral curve \\\\mathcal S=(\\\\Sigma,\\\\mathbb C,x,ydx,B) and \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal S}=(\\\\Sigma,\\\\mathbb C,y,-xdy,B), have the same F_g shifted by some terms. * Modular properties: In the case where \\\\Sigma is a compact algebraic curve with a marking of a symplectic basis of cycles, and \\\\omega_{0,2}=B is the fundamental second kind differential normalized on the marking, then the invariants \\\\omega_{g,n} are quasi-modular forms under the modular group of marking changes. The invariants \\\\omega_{g,n} satisfy BCOV equations.  Generalizations = Higher order ramifications  In case the branchpoints are not simple, the definition is amended as followsV. Bouchard, B.

Metrohm is the leading manufacturer of titration devices and one of the two biggest manufacturers of ion chromatography systems. Besides developing, producing and selling analysis instruments, the company develops applications for these, which find use in various industries. Metrohm employs over 2000 people in total, of whom ca. 560 work at the Herisau site, and as of 2007 generates an annual revenue of about 350 million Swiss Francs. History Metrohm was founded in 1943 in Herisau by Bertold Suhner and Willi Studer. At the outset, it produced measuring instruments for high-frequency technology and telecommunications. High-precision measuring instruments as well as radio receivers were added to its portfolio later on. In 1947, Suhner and Studer parted ways. Swiss journalist and author Peter Holenstein describes how this happened in his book on the lifework of co-founder Willi Studer: In June 1947, Emil Haefely, founder of the company Emil Haefely & Cie AG, which was one of Metrohm's first customers, asked Willi Studer, whom he had known for many years, to build a prototype for a cathode-ray oscilloscope. This being new technology for Metrohm, Bertold Suhner opposed the idea, fearing that the development wouldn't be possible within reasonable time and budget constraints. Indeed, while the development of the simpler instruments in Metrohm's portfolio had never taken Studer more than a few weeks, Studer still hadn't finished the prototype after several months at the end of November 1947. At this point, his colleague Suhner lost all hope that the project would come to a successful conclusion. A break between the co-founders was the result and led Studer to leave the company at the end of December 1947. From then on, Suhner ran the business by himself. Studer, on the other hand, went on to found his own company \\"Willi Studer\\", known as Studer today and famous for its audio equipment. In 1968, Bertold Suhner resigned from his post in the operational management of Metrohm and became strongly committed to the environment. He even fought for causes that could harm his own company, making it a difficult time for the new managing directors Lorenz Kuhn and Hans Winzeler. As a result of his intransigence in environmental matters, he also alienated friends, leaving him socially isolated towards the end of his life. Since 1982, Metrohm AG has been a full subsidiary of the Metrohm Foundation, which is the only shareholder of Metrohm AG. Metrohm co-founder Bertold Suhner put the foundation in place to ensure independence and thereby maintain the ability to make unswayed decisions. The foundation is however not only dedicated to the operation of Metrohm AG, but also to charitable and cultural purposes. For example, in 1999, the Metrohm Foundation equipped the public gymnasium Kantonsschule Trogen in the Swiss town of Trogen with internet access and more than 100 computer workstations to ensure that the public school can keep up with international standards. It has also endowed a professorship for the research on new materials at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences since 2014. Until 2006, 36 subsidiaries had been founded. For the most part, these are situated abroad and form a worldwide sales network. Research and development as well as production, however, remain at the Herisau site. Metrohm AG moved from the town center of Herisau in 2011 to its new premises in the industrial zone ‚ÄúH√∂lzli‚Äù. The new premises were expanded in 2015 to accommodate the growing number of employees. Product lines Metrohm develops and sells analysis instruments primarily for four chemical analysis techniques: * Ion chromatography (IC) ‚Äì This method is used to determine trace quantities of ions such as sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, chloride, fluoride, etc. (anions). IC is available but less commonly used for cations (metal ions) because other techniques, in particular atomic spectroscopy and voltammetry, are better suited for their determination. * Titrators serve the automatic execution of volumetric analyses. This classic wet-chemical technique remains the method of choice for, among others, the determination of water hardness and the analysis of the water content in organic solvents (Karl Fischer titration). * Polarography or, more generally, voltammetry denotes those electrochemical analysis methods that involve measuring a current as a function of an applied potential. It is useful for the determination of several important heavy metals in environmental samples and foodstuffs. Voltammetry is also suited for the determination of many organic analytes down to the ultra-trace level. * Near-infrared and Raman spectroscopy are used as secondary analysis techniques. For primary analysis, one of the above- mentioned chemical measuring techniques or other, physical measuring techniques are used. The use of chemometrics for data analysis is an essential part of NIR spectroscopy.

Many of his clients were from the nobility and royalty. He was sometimes referred to as the \\"sculpteur de souveraines\\" (sculptor of sovereigns).  Biography  He was the son of Adrien d'√âpinay, a lawyer and colonial politician. In 1839, his parents took him to France, where his father died suddenly a few months later. He returned to Mauritius with his mother and received his primary education there in Port Louis. In 1851, he went back to France with a former teacher as his legal guardian, to continue his studies, Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, Vanity Fair (1873) In 1857, he decided to pursue a career in art and settled permanently in Paris; studying sculpture in the studios of Jean-Pierre Dantan and finding himself attracted to 18th century art. It was at that time that he also began to draw caricatures. Thanks to a scholarship, he was able to study at the French Academy in RomeLa Nouvelle revue, 1887/11-12 (A9,T49), p.835., where he made studies of Classical sculpture under the tutelage of Luigi Amici (1817-1897), who created the statue at the tomb of Pope Gregory XVI.

His first success came in 1864, in London, where he presented a caricature of Napoleon III and Lord Palmerston walking arm-in-arm. Several thousand copies were printed by an English publisher. That same year, he was also commissioned by the Duc de Luynes, to create a statue of \\"Innocence\\" for the Ch√¢teau de Dampierre. The following year, he produced a bust of Alexandra of Denmark, the Princess of Wales. A monument to his father was dedicated in Port Louis in 1867. He provided cartoons to Vanity Fair from 1868 until his death. In 1869 he was married, in Paris, to Claire Mottet de La Fontaine (1844-1936), the daughter of Adolphe Mottet de La Fontaine (1795-1884), a Captain in the service of the Nizam of Hyderabad, Nasir-ud-Daulah. Her mother, Marie √âlisabeth de Warren (1814-1893), was a painter. She and her parents were born in India.Alix Laincel, Les peintres de la Femme, 1888, p. 234. After many years of shuttling between London, Paris and Rome, he decided to settle in London and made connections among the English aristocracy, but remained close to people with Parisian connections as well; especially the group centered on the Comte de Chambord, composed mainly of those who had left France following the Paris Commune. He returned to Paris for the Salon of 1874, where he displayed a sculpture of a nude female figure attempting to close a belt. Known as the \\"Golden Belt\\", it gained notoriety throughout Europe. His most famous work is probably a polychrome statue of Joan of Arc (Jeanne d‚ÄôArc au Sacre) which he exhibited at the Salon in 1902. Seven years later, one of his patrons offered the statue to Reims Cathedral, on the occasion of her beatification.

In the early Sengoku period, the Honj≈ç were weakened by internal rivalries. Honj≈ç Shigenaga (1540-1614) managed to reunite the clan, but was opposed by Uesugi Kenshin, who had united the Uesugi clan and was in control of southern Echigo. Kenshin defeated the Agakitashu petty lords one after another, and eventually forced Honj≈ç Shigenaga to submit. Shigenaga subsequently became noted general under Kenshin and fought at the Battle of Kawanakajima against Takeda Shingen. During the 1563 campaign against the Odawara H≈çj≈ç, he captured Sano Castle in K≈çzuke and was ranked as second among Kenshin's generals. However, he was dissatisfied with the small rewards he received from Kenshin and revolted in 1568 with the encouragement of Takeda Shingen. The outraged Kenshin laid siege to Murakami Castle, but could not take it by force. Shigenaga eventually surrendered in 1569 and was pardoned by Kenshin, but he revolted again ten years later, this time with the backing of Oda Nobunaga. After another bloody battle, he again surrendered and was again pardoned. After the death of Kenshin in 1578, Shigenaga supported Kenshin's successor Uesugi Kagekatsu. In 1588, Shigenaga defeated a Mogami army at the Battle of Jyugorihara and extended Uesugi control into the Sh≈çnai area. However, in 1598, Uesugi Kagekatsu was transferred to Aizu by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Shigenaga also accompanied him. The early fortifications consisted of earthen ditches and a wooden palisade. Honj≈ç Castle was awarded to Murakami Yorikatsu in 1598, who rebuilt it in the contemporary style with stone ramparts and who renamed it Murakami Castle. The Murakami were followed in 1618 by the Hori clan, who added a three-story donjon and rebuilt the surrounding castle town into what would eventually become the city of Murakami. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, Murakami saw a frequent change in rulers. The Hori were replaced by the Honda clan in 1643, followed by a branch of the Matsudaira clan in 1649. In 1649, Matsudaira Naoyori rebuilt the donjon and added new yagura watchtowers. However, in 1667 most of the castle was destroyed in a fire caused by lightning and its donjon and yagura were not rebuilt after that time. The Matsudaira were replaced by the Sakakibara clan in 1667, followed by the Honda again in 1704, the Matsudaira in 1710, the Manabe clan in 1717 and finally by a cadet branch of the Nait≈ç clan, who ruled until the Meiji Restoration of 1868. During the Boshin War of the Meiji restoration, although the samurai of the domain were divided between those who were loyal to the Tokugawa shogunate, and those who supported the imperial restoration, the domain joined the pro-Tokugawa ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei. Due to its strategic position at the entry to Dewa Province, the castle was attacked and destroyed by imperial forces. During the Meiji period, much of the stone ramparts were dismantled and the stones were sold to the townspeople of Murakami as building materials. Fearing that the remnants of the castle would disappear completely, descendants of former Murakami domain samurai formed a society to petition for the protection of the remaining ruins. In 1960, the area was granted protected status as a Niigata Prefectural Historic Monument. In 1993, this status was upgraded to that of a National Historic Site. The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017. Design of Murakami Castle Mount Gagy≈´ is long and narrow extending in a north to south direction, with the main areas of the castle spread along this ridge. The inner bailey is located at the top of the mountain, and at the southwest corner there was a three story donjon. On the northern corner of the inner bailey was a beak shaped terrace with a long and narrow secondary bailey (kuruwa), extending to the main gate. The stone walls of the inner bailey follow the contour of the original terrain. The main gate to the inner bailey as a large \\"masugata\\" gate. To the north of the main gate is the saddle of the ridge, and a third bailey, which was used for the drilling of troops. An outer gate was located on the western hillside, and next to this gate was the residence of the daimy≈ç. The total size of the castle was over 500 square meters, making it the second largest in Echigo after Kasugayama Castle.

She founded the True and Fair Campaign in 2012, calling for an end to financial misconduct in the investment and pension industries. She also founded the True and Fair Foundation.  Biography  Miller was born Gina Nadira Singh in British Guiana to Savitri and Doodnauth Singh, who later became Attorney General of Guyana. She is of Indian descent. She grew up in the newly independent Guyana, and was sent to England by her parents at the age of 10 to be educated at the fee-paying private Moira House Girls School in Eastbourne. When she was 14 Guyana introduced strict currency controls that prevented their parents from continuing to send funds for Gina and her brother, so she took a summer job as a chambermaid in an Eastbourne hotel. She studied law at the Polytechnic of East London (now University of East London) but left without completing her finals because her parents wanted her in Guyana. She has written that she was brutally attacked while at law school, that some of her attackers were fellow students, and that the attack caused her to give up her degree course. She gained a degree in marketing, and an MSc in human resource management at the University of London. She owned a property photographic laboratory in 1987, before becoming a marketing and event manager at BMW Fleet Division in 1990. She started a specialist financial services marketing agency in 1992, and launched the Senate investment conference programme in 1996. She became a marketing consultant in 2006. In February 2009, Miller co-founded the investment firm SCM Private (now SCM Direct) with her husband Alan Miller. She has been a leading campaigner against hidden charges in pensions and investment and what she has described as \\"flagrant mis-selling within the asset management market\\". She set up Miller Philanthropy (now rebranded the True and Fair Foundation) in 2009, and established MoneyShe.com in 2014, as a female-focused investment brand. She has been married three times, and has three children. In October 2017, Miller was named by Powerlist as the \\"UK's most influential black person\\" which recognises those of African and African Caribbean heritage. Those nominated were chosen by an independent panel with members including former High Court judge Dame Linda Dobbs and former Apprentice winner Tim Campbell. They rated nominees on their \\"ability to change lives and alter events\\". She was also named number 26 on the list of most influential British Asians by GG2 Power List.  True and Fair Foundation  Miller set up the True and Fair Foundation in 2009, with the stated aim of increasing philanthropy and common good in an era of growing inequality, social fragmentation and small state funding. It aimed to encourage those who have been successful to give back to the communities that afforded them their success, lessening the burden of giving for donors and philanthropists who wish to give smarter and in an efficient and transparent manner but may be time poor. The Foundation was a registered charity under English law and was removed from the register in July 2019.  True and Fair Campaign  In January 2012, she set up the True and Fair Campaign, with the stated aim to \\"limit the possibility of future mis-selling or financial scandals through greater transparency.\\" This initiative attracted the animosity of part of the City, earning her the nickname of \\"black widow spider\\". She reported being called \\"a disgrace [whose] lobbying efforts would bring down the entire City\\",  Brexit legal challenge  In June 2016, subsequent to the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Miller privately engaged the City of London law firm Mishcon de Reya to challenge the authority of the British Government to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union using prerogative powers, arguing that only Parliament can take away rights that Parliament has granted. On 3 November 2016, the High Court of Justice ruled that Parliament had to legislate before the Government could invoke Article 50. Miller said outside the High Court: \\"The judgment, I hope ‚Äì when it's read by the Government and they contemplate the full judgment ‚Äì that they will make the wise decision of not appealing but pressing forward and having a proper debate in our sovereign Parliament, our mother of parliaments that we are so admired for all over the world\\".  Motivations  Miller stated in various interviews that she was only pressing on with the legal action as a matter of democracy and parliamentary supremacy. Following the case, she made clear her opposition to Brexit: \\"I beg you, as Labour's leader, to reject a policy that will so obviously turn our country into a laboratory for one of the most extreme rightwing experiments we have witnessed since the 1930s.\\" Others have suggested that she simply wanted to prevent Brexit via whatever means available.  Outcome  The Government's appeal to the Supreme Court was heard in December 2016. When closing the hearing, the Court President said that the appeal raised important constitutional issues, and the Justices would take time to give full consideration to the many arguments presented to them, orally and in writing, and they would do their best to resolve the case as quickly as possible.SC Transcript, 8 December 2016, p.204 When the Supreme Court delivered judgment in January 2017, it upheld the High Court ruling by a majority of 8‚Äì3.Supreme Court Judgment [2017] UKSC 5. After the government's appeal was dismissed, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU formally introduced in Parliament, on 26 January 2017, a bill that, on 16 March, was enacted without amendment as the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017.Explanatory Notes, Prepared 25 January 2017 On 31st January 2020, the United Kingdom officially left the European Union following a vote by MPs in favour of the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill, 358 to 234 - a majority of 124; the bill also banned an extension of the transition period, beyond its expiry at the end of 2020.  Abuse and threats  The legal challenge met with a \\"torrent\\" of abuse from supporters of Brexit, including racial abuse and death threats. In the two days following the judges' decision, more than 79,000 tweets mentioned her account, of which about 13 per cent were hostile. Many referred to her as a traitor and mentioned her perceived foreignness. Miller's solicitor, Mishcon de Reya, was subjected to abuse as a result of its involvement in the case, and Brexit supporters mounted a protest outside the firm's offices. A man, aged 55, was arrested in November 2016 on suspicion of racially aggravated malicious communications over threats to Miller, but was later told he would not be prosecuted. Another man, aged 50, was arrested in January 2017, also in relation to the complaint made in November; the second man was later named as Rhodri Philipps, 4th Viscount St Davids, who was charged on 7 March. Philipps, of Knightsbridge, London, described Miller as a \\"boat jumper\\" and added: \\"If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles\\". Philipps also posted \\"¬£5,000 for the first person to 'accidentally' run over this bloody troublesome first generation immigrant\\" on Facebook. He pleaded \\"not guilty\\" to three charges of malicious communication under section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 when he appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 2 May 2017. At the May hearing, the prosecution said the crown would seek an increased sentence because of the racial aggravation factor. He was found guilty of two charges at his trial on 11 July 2017, at which he defended himself. Philipps described his own comments as \\"satire\\". He was later sentenced to 12 weeks in prison. At least eight other people were issued with cease and desist notices by the police. In August 2017, Miller said she had faced continuing threats of acid attacks in recent months, and fears leaving her home. In October 2019 detectives with the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into a GoFundMe campaign seeking to raise ¬£10,000 to hire a hitman to kill Miller.  Election activity = 2017 general election  Miller organised a crowdfunding campaign to back candidates opposed to a 'hard Brexit' in the 2017 general election. As of 21 April 2017, the campaign had raised over ¬£300,000. On 26 April 2017, Miller launched the Best for Britain campaign at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. The campaign called for a tactical vote to ensure elected MPs have a real final vote on the Brexit deal. It also encouraged young people to become actively engaged in the Brexit debate. She stated publicly that she personally would vote Liberal Democrat for the first time, having previously been a Labour supporter.Olivia Marks, \\"Gina Miller: Why You Should Vote Tactically\\", Vogue, 31 May 2017 She left Best for Britain after the election, describing it as both \\"a room full of white males deciding what's going to happen to the country\\" and \\"undemocratic\\". She also launched a legal challenge against the Conservative‚ÄìDUP agreement, the confidence-and-supply agreement secured by Theresa May's government in the aftermath of the election.  2019 European Parliament election  On 8 May 2019, Miller set up a website, Remain United, to encourage tactical voting in the EU parliamentary election on 23 May, to maximise the number of MEPs of various parties elected who support remaining in the EU.  Prorogation of parliament legal challenge  On 28 August 2019, Miller was one of a number of parties to launch legal proceedings against the Johnson government for prorogation of parliament, claiming to do so was unconstitutional. On 6 September 2019 the High Court ruled that the decision to suspend Parliament was lawful and dismissed her case but granted permission to appeal. A similar case lodged before the Scottish Court of Session found several days later that prorogation was unlawful as it had \\"the effect of stymying Parliament\\", setting up a hearing before the Supreme Court for 17 September. On 24 September 2019, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that prorogation was unlawful.

It is only found on South East Island (Rangatira), Houruakopara and Mangere Islands in the Chatham Islands, New Zealand. It is one of New Zealand's largest and rarest spiders. Description This large Dolomedes spider was first described by Eug√®ne Simon in 1899 as \\"one of the biggest and most robust species of the genus Dolomedes\\". This species demonstrates sexual dimorphism, with male body lengths of and females of . Both males and females are substantially larger than other New Zealand Dolomedes species. The carapace and legs are red-brown with orange stripes on the centre and sides of the abdomen. They have bright eye shine and can be spotted at night from 20 metres away. Ecology D. schauinslandi is active at night in forest and scrubland habitat, where it hunts for wƒìtƒÅ on the forest floor or tree trunks. Its predators may include mice and weka, which would explain its absence from Pitt Island, where it was described as common in the original species description. Mating has not been observed, but females have been observed carrying egg sacs in their chelicerae in November and December and guarding their nursery from December to February, as would be expected for a nursery web spider. Conservation This species, the only Dolomedes known from the Chatham Islands, is classified as having a relict population status, due to it surviving in less than 10% of its previously known habitat. It was probably present on the main Chatham Island prior to human settlement, as it is found on mouse-free Houruakopara Island which is only 200 m offshore. The other two islands in its current range, Mangere and Rangatira, are now free of introduced mammals and have restricted access to maintain their predator-free status; Rangatira was farmed up to the 1960s, but cats, mice, and rats were never introduced there. The Rangatira spider was first described from specimens collected on Pitt Island, but despite substantial surveys it has not been seen there since the early 1900s. Mice, which are known spider predators, were accidentally introduced to Pitt some time before 1951, and may have driven D. schauinslandi extinct there. It is possible that this species could re-establish itself on Pitt Island, if there was suitable predator-free habitat (Pitt Island has mice but not rats); spiderlings lift their abdomens when exposed to a breeze in the lab, which is a behaviour associated with aerial travel by ballooning.

The Fly Algorithm has first been developed in 1999 in the scope of the application of Evolutionary algorithms to computer stereo vision. Unlike the classical image-based approach to stereovision, which extracts image primitives then matches them in order to obtain 3-D information, the Fly Agorithm is based on the direct exploration of the 3-D space of the scene. A fly is defined as a 3-D point described by its coordinates (x, y, z). Once a random population of flies has been created in a search space corresponding to the field of view of the cameras, its evolution (based on the Evolutionary Strategy paradigm) used a fitness function that evaluates how likely the fly is lying on the visible surface of an object, based on the consistency of its image projections. To this end, the fitness function uses the grey levels, colours and/or textures of the calculated fly's projections. The first application field of the Fly Algorithm has been stereovision. While classical \`image priority' approaches use matching features from the stereo images in order to build a 3-D model, the Fly Algorithm directly explores the 3-D space and uses image data to evaluate the validity of 3-D hypotheses. A variant called the \\"Dynamic Flies\\" defines the fly as a 6-uple (x, y, z, x‚Äô, y‚Äô, z‚Äô) involving the fly's velocity. The velocity components are not explicitly taken into account in the fitness calculation but are used in the flies' positions updating and are subject to similar genetic operators (mutation, crossover). The application of Flies to obstacle avoidance in vehicles exploits the fact that the population of flies is a time compliant, quasi-continuously evolving representation of the scene to directly generate vehicle control signals from the flies. The use of the Fly Algorithm is not strictly restricted to stereo images, as other sensors may be added (e.g. acoustic proximity sensors, etc.) as additional terms to the fitness function being optimised. Odometry information can also be used to speed up the updating of flies' positions, and conversely the flies positions can be used to provide localisation and mapping information. Another application field of the Fly Algorithm is reconstruction for emission Tomography in nuclear medicine. The Fly Algorithm has been successfully applied in single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography . Here, each fly is considered a photon emitter and its fitness is based on the conformity of the simulated illumination of the sensors with the actual pattern observed on the sensors. Within this application, the fitness function has been re-defined to use the new concept of 'marginal evaluation'. Here, the fitness of one individual is calculated as its (positive or negative) contribution to the quality of the global population. It is based on the leave-one-out cross-validation principle. A global fitness function evaluates the quality of the population as a whole; only then the fitness of an individual (a fly) is calculated as the difference between the global fitness values of the population with and without the particular fly whose individual fitness function has to be evaluated. In the fitness of each fly is considered as a \`level of confidence'. It is used during the voxelisation process to tweak the fly's individual footprint using implicit modelling (such as metaballs). It produces smooth results that are more accurate. More recently it has been used in digital art to generate mosaic-like images or spray paint. Examples of images can be found on YouTube  Parisian evolution  Here, the population of individuals is considered as a society where the individuals collaborate toward a common goal. This is implemented using an evolutionary algorithm that includes all the common genetic operators (e.g. mutation, cross-over, selection). The main difference is in the fitness function. Here two levels of fitness function are used: * A local fitness function to assess the performance of a given individual (usually used during the selection process). * A global fitness function to assess the performance of the whole population. Maximising (or minimising depending on the problem considered) this global fitness is the goal of the population. In addition, a diversity mechanism is required to avoid individuals gathering in only a few areas of the search space. Another difference is in the extraction of the problem solution once the evolutionary loop terminates. In classical evolutionary approaches, the best individual corresponds to the solution and the rest of the population is discarded. Here, all the individuals (or individuals of a sub-group of the population) are collated to build the problem solution. The way the fitness functions are constructed and the way the solution extraction is made are of course problem-dependent. Examples of Parisian Evolution applications include: * The Fly algorithm. * Text-mining. * Hand gesture recognition. * Modelling complex interactions in industrial agrifood process. * Positron Emission Tomography reconstruction.  Disambiguation = Parisian approach vs cooperative coevolution  Cooperative coevolution is a broad class of evolutionary algorithms where a complex problem is solved by decomposing it into subcomponents that are solved independently. The Parisian approach shares many similarities with the cooperative coevolutionary algorithm. The Parisian approach makes use of a single-population whereas multi-species may be used in cooperative coevolutionary algorithm. Similar internal evolutionary engines are considered in classical evolutionary algorithm, cooperative coevolutionary algorithm and Parisian evolution. The difference between cooperative coevolutionary algorithm and Parisian evolution resides in the population's semantics. Cooperative coevolutionary algorithm divides a big problem into sub-problems (groups of individuals) and solves them separately toward the big problem. There is no interaction/breeding between individuals of the different sub- populations, only with individuals of the same sub-population. However, Parisian evolutionary algorithms solve a whole problem as a big component. All population's individuals cooperate together to drive the whole population toward attractive areas of the search space.  Fly Algorithm vs particle swarm optimisation  Cooperative coevolution and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) share many similarities. PSO is inspired by the social behaviour of bird flocking or fish schooling. It was initially introduced as a tool for realistic animation in computer graphics. It uses complex individuals that interact with each other in order to build visually realistic collective behaviours through adjusting the individuals' behavioural rules (which may use random generators). In mathematical optimisation, every particle of the swarm somehow follows its own random path biased toward the best particle of the swarm. In the Fly Algorithm, the flies aim at building spatial representations of a scene from actual sensor data; flies do not communicate or explicitly cooperate, and do not use any behavioural model. Both algorithms are search methods that start with a set of random solutions, which are iteratively corrected toward a global optimum. However, the solution of the optimisation problem in the Fly Algorithm is the population (or a subset of the population): The flies implicitly collaborate to build the solution. In PSO the solution is a single particle, the one with the best fitness. Another main difference between the Fly Algorithm and with PSO is that the Fly Algorithm is not based on any behavioural model but only builds a geometrical representation.  Applications of the Fly algorithnm  * Computer stereo vision * Obstacle avoidance * Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) * Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) reconstruction * Positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction * Digital art  Example: Tomography reconstruction  Tomography reconstruction is an inverse problem that is often ill-posed due to missing data and/or noise. The answer to the inverse problem is not unique, and in case of extreme noise level it may not even exist. The input data of a reconstruction algorithm may be given as the Radon transform or sinogram \\\\left(Y\\\\right) of the data to reconstruct \\\\left(f\\\\right). f is unknown; Y is known. The data acquisition in tomography can be modelled as: Y = P[f] + \\\\epsilon where P is the system matrix or projection operator and \\\\epsilon corresponds to some Poisson noise. In this case the reconstruction corresponds to the inversion of the Radon transform: f = P^{-1}[Y] Note that P^{-1} can account for noise, acquisition geometry, etc. The Fly Algorithm is an example of iterative reconstruction. Iterative methods in tomographic reconstruction are relatively easy to model: \\\\hat{f} = \\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,min}  Y - \\\\hat{Y}^2_2 where \\\\hat{f} is an estimate of f, that minimises an error metrics (here -norm, but other error metrics could be used) between Y and \\\\hat{Y}. Note that a regularisation term can be introduced to prevent overfitting and to smooth noise whilst preserving edges. Iterative methods can be implemented as follows: Iterative correction in tomography reconstruction. (i) The reconstruction starts using an initial estimate of the image (generally a constant image), (ii) Projection data is computed from this image, (iii) The estimated projections are compared with the measured projections, (iv) Corrections are made to correct the estimated image, and (v) The algorithm iterates until convergence of the estimated and measured projection sets. The pseudocode below is a step-by-step description of the Fly Algorithm for tomographic reconstruction. The algorithm follows the steady-state paradigm. For illustrative purposes, advanced genetic operators, such as mitosis, dual mutation, etc. are ignored. A JavaScript implementation can be found on Fly4PET. algorithm fly-algorithm is input: number of flies (N), input projection data (preference) output: the fly population (F), the projections estimated from F (pestimated) the 3-D volume corresponding to the voxelisation of F (VF) postcondition: the difference between pestimated and preference is minimal.

A tile has an orientation (angle Œ∏), a three colour components (R, G, B), a size (w, h) and a position (x, y, z). If there are N tiles, there are 9N unknown floating point numbers to guess. In other words for 5,000 tiles, there are 45,000 numbers to find. Using a classical evolutionary algorithm where the answer of the optimisation problem is the best individual, the genome of an individual would made of 45,000 genes. This approach would be extremely costly in term of complexity and computing time. The same applies for any classical optimisation algorithm. Using the Fly Algorithm, every individual mimics a tile and can be individually evaluated using its local fitness to assess its contribution to the population's performance (the global fitness). Here an individual has 9 genes instead of 9N, and there are N individuals. It can be solved as a reconstruction problem as follows: reconstruction = \\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,min} \\\\overset{x where input is the input image, x and y are the pixel coordinates along the horizontal and vertical axis respectively, W and H are the image width and height in number of pixels respectively, F is the fly population, and P is a projection operator that creates an image from flies. This projection operator P can take many forms. In her work, Z. Ali Aboodd uses OpenGL to generate different effects (e.g. mosaics, or spray paint). For speeding up the evaluation of the fitness functions, OpenCL is used too. The algorithm starts with a population F that is randomly generated (see Line 3 in the algorithm above). F is then assessed using the global fitness to compute G_{fitness}(F) = \\\\overset{x (see Line 10). G_{fitness} is an error metrics, it has to be minimised.

In Indo-China war, the pass has closed the trade between India and Tibet were stop, due to the agitation of Indo china War, the most of trader and porter retreat from silk route and some settle there after the war. The remaining settlers used to work in BRO (Border Road Organisation ), some in agriculture and the Indian army as a porter. There is an Indian Army base at Dzuluk, which has been used as a transit camp for the army movement to the Indo-Chinese border nearby. Due to poor quality of the soil and vagaries of weather, farming is well high impossible. Neither is there any possibility for cattle rearing as an occupation; most of the land is fenced and military-controlled, making it unfit for grazing.

The council was proclaimed on 8 August 1872, comprising the whole of the cadastral Hundred of Hanson. Its foundation was controversial: it had reportedly been supported by 40 farmers representing 13,000 acres and opposed by 48 farmers representing \\"about the same quantity of land\\", in addition to two large landholders representing 33,000 acres. The opponents of the council claimed that the proponents were mostly within the government town of Hanson (now Farrell Flat), and that most of the proposed district did not share a common interest with the town. However, those who supported the council were successful when the government decided to \\"extend the advantages of self-government\\" and recommended its proclamation. There was further controversy later in the year when the government appointed an opponent as a councillor to replace a supporter who had been disqualified. The council was divided into five wards in November 1873: Eastern Ward, Gum Creek Ward, Hanson Ward, Western Ward and North-Eastern Ward. Gum Creek Ward and Western Ward were amalgamated into a Middle Ward in 1879, while the North-Eastern Ward became the North Ward during the 1870s and was later abolished. A tender for a council chamber for the new council was accepted in 1874 at the \\"Torreston\\" subdivision at what is now Farrell Flat. This first chamber was vacated in 1878 and leased to the Education Department for school purposes, while the council selected a site for a new chamber and began construction later that year. In 1923, the council was meeting \\"for the matter of convenience\\" at Kooringa in Burra. In 1923, it was described as a \\"small agricultural district\\" with an area of 77,440 acres, with the capital value of ratable property being ¬£329,940. It had a population of 641 persons, residing in 148 dwellings, at the 1921 census.

It was released on October 10, 2011, under YMC Entertainment and distributed by CJ E&M; Music. The record served as the final release before the singer enlisted in military service. Following a video teaser, They Are Coming and the lead single of the same name were simultaneously released; the mini-album debuted and peaked at number nine on the Gaon Album Chart. In spite of various health issues, Wheesung promoted the record on music chart programs across television networks by performing the single. Background In February 2011, it was announced that Wheesung would be subject to conscription in South Korea, and was scheduled to enlist for military service within the final two months of the year. They Are Coming served as his final release prior to his enlistment on November 7. Music structure Musically, They Are Coming is an R&B; and hip hop record. It begins with the opening track \\"Music\\". An uptempo song, the lyrics are a reflection of Wheesung's career in the ten years prior. \\"They Are Coming\\" was described as a \\"dramatic\\" hip hop and R&B; song. \\"UUU\\" is evocative of a Europop-dance style. Release and promotion The release of They Are Coming was first announced on September 30, 2011. A music video teaser for the song \\"They Are Coming\\" was released on October 6. The mini-album and the music video for the title track were simultaneously released on October 10. On October 13, Wheesung began promoting \\"They Are Coming\\" by performing the song on weekly music chart shows. Prior to his first performance on Mnet's M Countdown, he began to suffer from \\"severe abdominal pain\\", vertigo, a common cold, and fatigue. Although he performed \\"UUU\\" live, he was required to lip sync the title track. After being diagnosed with gastritis and enteritis, Wheesung continued to perform the lead single the following day on KBS2's Music Bank in spite of a doctor's advisory to rest. He also performed the song on MBC TV's program Beautiful Concert. Critical reception Writing for online magazine IZM, Park Bom rated They Are Coming three and a half stars out of five. She lauded \\"Music\\" and described it as a song which \\"expresses self- confidence, honesty, and aspiration, which compiles the emotions of music\\". Rating the mini-album three stars out of five, Lee Byeong-ju of Rhythmer understood that They Are Coming served as \\"commemorative remembrance of Wheesung's enlistment\\", but expressed doubt in the record's \\"significance\\". He chose \\"Music\\" as the best song on the mini-album and commended Wheesung's particular autobiographical lyrics throughout the record, but he felt that arrangements and melodies for the remaining songs were \\"not so impressive and clich√©\\". He also noted that, despite Wheesung's vocal ability, the singer was \\"too cautious\\" and his vocal delivery was limited. Commercial performance On the chart dated October 9 ‚Äì 15, 2011, They Are Coming debuted at number nine on the Gaon Album Chart. By the end of the month, the mini-album sold 4,766 copies in South Korea.

It has smooth, silvery to greyish bark, sometimes with rough flaky bark near the base, lance-shaped adult leaves, pendulous, elongated flower buds arranged in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and cup-shaped to bell-shaped fruit.flowers and budsfruitbark Description Eucalyptus diminuta is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth silvery to greyish bark, sometimes with a short stocking of rough flaky bark near the base. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull, bluish, egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The buds are arrange in groups of seven on a thin, pendulous, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are elongated with a rounded tip, long and wide with a conical to horn-shaped operculum. Flowering occurs between July and November and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, conical to cup-shaped or bell-shaped capsule long wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus diminuta was first formally described by the botanists Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper in 2002 in the journal Nuytsia. The type specimen was collected by Brooker near Glenfield on the road to Yuna. The specific epithet (diminuta) is a Latin word meaning \\"diminished\\", referring to the size of the plants, its buds and fruit compared to the related E. stowardii. This species is part of the Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus in the section Bisectae and the subsection Glandulosae. It is closely related to E. stowardii. Distribution and habitat The spring mallee is found on sandplains and near swamps along the west coast in the Mid West and Wheatbelt regions of Western Australia where it grows over laterite in sandy clay or sandy soils. Conservation status Eucalyptus diminuta is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Early life Born and raised in Gisborne, Bridge took up rugby at the age of 5 and before long his skills brought him to the attention of New Zealand provincial rugby giants . He played age-grade rugby with them all the way up to the age of 19 and was named as Canterbury's under-19 player of the year in 2014. He also spent time with the academy and made a big impression in a Super Rugby warm-up match with the in 2016 in which he scored two tries.

He scored five tries in eight matches as the Cantabrians finished the season as Premiership champions, their eighth title in nine years. Bridge was a member of the New Zealand Under 20 side which competed in the 2015 World Rugby Under 20 Championship in Italy where he made two appearances and scored a try. His debut season at provincial level saw him coached by Canterbury legend Scott Robertson and like his coach, Bridge found himself promoted to Super Rugby level in 2017, earning a contract with the Crusaders. Bridge made a successful start to the 2017 season, notching his first Super Rugby try against the Waratahs in Sydney. The Crusaders withstood a late charge, to win the contest 41-22. Bridge has subsequently elevated his game, scoring a hat trick of tries during the Crusaders 57-21 demolition of the Stormers in Christchurch on 21 April 2017. Bridge followed this effort with another 3 tries a week later, during another comprehensive Crusaders win over the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein on 29 April 2017. With All Black midfielder Ryan Crotty out injured, Bridge was moved into the starting XV for the Crusaders, to play against the touring 2017 British and Irish Lions team, on 10 June 2017. Bridge played for 65 minutes of the historic fixture, before he was replaced by Tim Bateman. The Crusaders lost 3-12. Bridge was voted as the Crusaders' Rookie of the Year by his team-mates at the end of the 2017 season, when they won the Super Rugby final against the Lions, beating the Lions by 25-17. Bridge came off the bench in the match, completing his 2017 season on a high note and then, was subsequently signed on to 2022 by the Crusaders. On 4 November 2017 on his first International debut, Bridge started at 15 in the Barbarians F.C. vs the All Blacks under former Crusader and Wallaby coach Robbie Deans. Alongside his fellow Crusader teammate Richie Mo'unga at 10, Bridge scored 2 tries.

Bridge was one of the top-try scorers of the 2018 season and scored his 15th try of the season during the semi-final against the Hurricanes. Bridge's form during the season saw Dagg displaced from the match-day 23 during the Super Rugby playoffs, with Bridge starting in the Super Rugby final. The Crusaders once again played against the Lions in the final, on 4 August 2018, beating them for the second consecutive year and winning 37-18. Bridge started in the 2018 Mitre 10 Cup's final, against Auckland, on 27 October 2018.

He was a pioneer in Japanese socialism and in the early Boy Scout movement in Japan. Life and career=Early life Fukao was born on the estate of a hatamoto samurai within Sunpu Castle (in the modern city of Shizuoka) on 12 November 1880. His father Nobushir≈ç was a retainer in Sunpu Domain who worked as a tax collector and teacher. After graduating from elementary school, his father encouraged Fukao to go to a normal school, but he declined as he disliked the duties and obligations. As a youth he often submitted articles to arts magazines. He worked at the Shizuoka prison and Numazu local court before becoming a substitute teacher at Sodeshi Jinj≈ç Elementary School in 1897. He was issued a teacher's assistant's licence in 1898 and thereafter worked for seven schools in Shizuoka and the northern island-prefecture Hokkaido. Socialism In 1901, Fukao took part in the inauguration of the Shizuoka branch of the social reform group Ris≈çdan (\\"Band of Idealists\\"). Beginning in his time as a teacher, Fukao contributed to the weekly libertarian-socialist newspaper Heimin Shimbun. He aimed at establishing an elementary teachers' labour union in Hokkaido, but his parents demanded his return to Shizuoka in July 1904 after the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War. In 1905, Fukao and fellow Shizuokans Masatar≈ç Watanabe (1873‚Äì1918) and Harako Motoi (1880‚Äì1933) devised the Dend≈ç Gy≈çsh≈ç to proselytize socialism. They had planned to set out from Tokyo that April to travel around Hokkaido, but Watanabe withdrew, and on the advice of Kanson Arahata changed their destination to the closer K≈çfu area. The left the offices of Heiminsha, the publishers of Heimin Shimbun, on 10 April. On 13 April they were investigated by the local police, who took their promotional material into custody, so the pair returned to the Heiminsha offices the next day. That May they began doing land clearing work in Hokkaido as the Heimin N≈çj≈ç (\\"Commoners' Farm\\"). Administrating the farm was exceedingly difficult; in August Fukao left it to Harako to manage and went back to Tokyo, never to return. He joined the Y≈´bunsha, an organization made up of former members of Heiminsha after its dissolution, and took part in editing the magazine Katei Zasshi. Scouting While undergoing medical treatment in the spring of 1909 Fukao obtained Boy Scouts founder Baden- Powell's handbook Scouting for Boys, which he had learned about from an English-language newspaper. He began researching the Scouting movement with his uncle, the editor of Sh≈çnen Jih≈ç, the results of which appeared in Sh≈çnen Jih≈ç that year with a call for the foundation of a \\"Boys' Army Corps\\". They began to put such a corps together in 1910 in cooperation with Colonel Yoshinori Shirakawa, who was the Infantry Regiment Commander of Shizuoka, but the plans were scuttled soon after when Shirakawa was transferred. Fukao went to Tokyo in 1910 and took the position of secretary for Shid≈çkai, and on the stipend he received lobbied to establish a Boy Scouts movement. In 1912 he visited Nogi Maresuke at the Gakush≈´in to stress the importance of the Boy Scouts movement, and thereafter made repeated visits to Nogi. He also visited military authorities such as Tanaka Giichi and educators such as to gain cooperation in the establishment of a boys' army corps. In 1913 he hosted meetings such as one for elementary school principals in about the establishment of a boys' army corps, but as some questioned Fukao's personal history, the plans failed to reach fruition. From 1914 to 1916 Fukao worked as a reporter for the Shizuoka Shinp≈ç newspaper. During this time, he gained the friendship of Yoshinori Futara, the head of school affairs for Shizuoka Prefecture. Futara introduced Fukao to Motojir≈ç Ozaki, a member of the Diet. The Shizuoka Sh≈çnen Gundan (\\"Shizuoka Boys' Army Corps\\") was formed in June 1913 with Ozaki as leader and Fukao and Keijir≈ç Takasugi as directors. 111 members took part in the enrollment ceremony at Sengen Shrine. Takasugi wanted Fukao removed for his previous activity as a socialist, but Ozaki supported Fukao. Fukao moved in 1916 to Okitsu (now part of Shimizu Ward in Shizuoka), and the Shizuoka Sh≈çnen Gundan had to dissolve. He returned to Shizuoka in 1918 as a reporter for the newspaper and formed the Shizuoka Sh≈çnendan (\\"Shizuoka Boy Scouts\\") with Ozaki and Reiichi Okamoto. The Scout Association of Japan recognized Fukao for his contributions at an annual general meeting on 20 June 1953 and awarded him the Golden Eagle Award for merit in 1957.

Amsterdam: Rozenberg Publishers. is peer education project started in 1996 by Jaap Jamin at the large Amsterdam-based addiction prevention and treatment organisation Jellinek. It has steadily grown to become the Netherlands' largest nightlife peer education initiative, and has similarities with initiatives such as DanceSafe in the United States.  Background  In the Netherlands in the early nineties, the underground dance scene became more mainstream. The observed high prevalence of substances in nightlife settings prompted the development of a new health promotion initiative: the Unity peer education project. Although initially funded as a European Union project, as a best practice Unity quickly became a structural part of its mother organisation, Jellinek Prevention. In 2005 and 2006, a manual was published and promoted Noijen, J., van Bakkum, F., Jamin, J., Visser & Schippers, G. (2006) Verslaving 2(3), pp 89‚Äì93. to encourage wider adoption of this technique.  Quality label  Although initially conceived as an intervention largely shaped by the peer educators, over the years principles from systematic intervention development, specifically the Intervention Mapping protocol, were implemented to ensure that Unity was theory- and evidence based. In 2011, Unity requested and was granted the quality label \\"well developed\\" by the Dutch health promotion watchdog organisation Centrum Gezond Leven.  International health promotion  As the nightlife crowd in Amsterdam became more and more international, Unity has produced a number of international [health promotion interventions]. Most of these targeted mainly knowledge and awareness, such as a movie explaining Dutch drug policy to tourists. These have generally been well received.

It has smooth greenish to brownish bark, linear to lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three, each with two wings along the sides, creamy white to pale lemon-coloured flowers and cup-shaped to hemispherical fruit, also with two wings on the sides. Description Eucalyptus diptera is a mallet that typically grows to a height of but can reach as high as with smooth, shiny, spirally fluted, greenish to brownish bark. It does not form a lignotuber. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull bluish green leaves arranged alternately and broadly lance-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are glossy green, linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three, the groups and individual buds more or less sessile. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with two wings along the sides of the floral cup. The operculum is conical and long. Flowering occurs between February and May or August and September and the flowers are creamy white to pale lemon-coloured or yellow-green flowers. The fruit is a woody, sessile cup-shaped to hemispherical capsule long and wide with two wings along the sides. Taxonomy Eucalyptus diptera was first formally described by the Cecil Andrews from a specimen he collected \\"in flower north of Esperance\\". The description was published in the Journal of the West Australian Natural History Society. The specific epithet (diptera) is derived from the Ancient Greek prefix di- meaning \\"two\\" and pteron meaning \\"wing\\", referring to the wings on the sides of the flower buds and fruit. Two- winged gimlet is one of the nine species known as gimlets, noted for their smooth, shiny twisted trunks. As with other mallets, it does not develop a lignotuber but grows from seed when the adult tree is killed by fire. Distribution and habitat This gimlet is found on flats in inland areas, growing in open shrubland or as thickets in the Wheatbelt and Goldfields- Esperance regions between Lake Grace and Norseman. Conservation status Eucalyptus diptera is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This plant is sold commercially and makes a good ornamental or shade tree. It prefers a full sun position, will tolerate drought and moderate frost, and grow in coastal locations.

Constable. p. 219-221 It has been described as ‚Äúa perfect example of a 16/17th century mansion‚Äù. History The castle was built by Sir William Bruce, a survivor of the Battle of Flodden, in 1546. One member of the family died at the battle of Worcester in 1651. Another, Sir Andrew, gained himself the name ‚ÄúBloody Bruce‚Äù by hacking off the hands and head of Covenanter Richard Cameron after defeating him at the battle of Airds Moss during the Killing Time. The castle became abandoned and ruinous, until it was restored by Sir Robert Lorimer in 1892, for R W R Mackenzie, a bleacher from Perth. It has passed through several hands since, and is still occupied. The tapestries, paintings and Lorimer furniture have been dispersed. Structure There is a main block of three storeys and a garret. There is a large tower at one corner, with a small stair-turret in the angle with the main block. On the other corner a round stair tower is corbelled out to square; at the top is a watch-chamber. The dormer pediments are decorated by carved heraldic devices, and inscribed with the initials W.B. and S.A.C. The vaulted basement is reached through the entrance in the stair-tower. On the first floor is the hall, which has panelled walls, and a large carved fireplace, wide. The second floor ceiling is decorated in tempera; this dates from 1620. The decoration includes paintings of an ostrich and an armadillo, and mottoes such as ‚ÄúA NICE WYF AND A BACK DOORE OFT MAKETH A RICH MAN POORE‚Äù. The ceiling was carefully taken down and the missing parts replaced during the restoration by Lorimer. The main block, with a slightly higher wing, occupies two sides of the courtyard; there is a separate tower with three storey, the lower two vaulted, and some buildings dated to the 17th century. The courtyard is entered through an archway, dated 1546, bearing the arms of Sir William Bruce. There is a formal garden, replanted since the restoration of 1892. It has yew hedges and topiary. The castle is a category A listed building. As of 2019, the castle was a private residence with ten bedrooms and eight reception rooms, including the Long Galley with a famous painted ceiling, restored by Sir Robert Lorimer.Spectacular Scottish Castles Tradition The ghost of Sir Andrew Bruce, the ‚ÄòBloody Bruce‚Äô, is said to haunt the castle.

The council was proclaimed on 28 September 1872, comprising the whole of the cadastral Hundred of Kooringa and the southern portion of the Hundred of Kingston. It was divided into four wards at its inception: Kooringa Ward (two councillors), North Ward, Redruth Ward and South Ward (one councillor each). The proclamation appointed the first councillors: John Dunstan (North), Isaac Killicoat (Redruth), John Drew and Henry Dawson (Kooringa) and Alexander McCulloch (South).

It had only been in existence for four years when the Corporate Town of Burra was created in 1876, severing the main township from the council. On 24 August 1876, the district and ward boundaries were realigned, with the council having three wards: Redruth and South Wards (two councillors) and Kooringa Ward (one councillor).

It was triggered on 4 November 2016 by the resignation of the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Stephen Phillips, who left Parliament due to policy differences with the Conservative government led by Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit‚Äîthe British withdrawal from the European Union (EU). The Conservatives nominated Caroline Johnson, a paediatrician, to replace Phillips; she won the by-election with more than 50% of the vote, a sizable majority. Nevertheless, the party's absolute majority (number of votes) decreased significantly, and the Conservatives' vote share fell slightly, compared to the result in the constituency at the 2015 general election. Phillips had won a large majority at the previous general election in 2015, at which the Labour Party candidate came second. The constituency had been held by the Conservatives since it was first contested in the 1997 general election and was considered a safe seat for the party. Sleaford and North Hykeham is estimated to have had a vote-share of more than 60% in favour of leaving the EU in the 23 June 2016 EU membership referendum and Brexit was a key issue in the campaign. Phillips had supported a UK withdrawal from the EU but resigned in opposition to the government's handling of the issue; he felt Parliament was not being consulted sufficiently. Ten candidates stood in the by-election; the anti-EU party UK Independence Party (UKIP) came second with 13.5% of the vote, followed by the Liberal Democrats with 11% of the vote and then Labour. The by-election result was widely seen as poor for the Labour Party, whose vote share decreased by 7%; many MPs and analysts felt this was because of Labour's stance on Brexit‚Äîan attempt to appeal to voters on both sides of the debate. Background=Constituency The UK Parliament constituency of Sleaford and North Hykeham is located in Lincolnshire, which is in the East Midlands region of England. The constituency covers a large area of the county south-west of Lindsey and consists of most of the district of North Kesteven as well as several wards of the district of South Kesteven. Sleaford and North Hykeham is a county constituency, which means it is partly rural. , 84.7% of the population is economically active, which is higher than both the regional and national averages. The most important industries in the area are wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing, and human health and social work. The average gross weekly pay for full-time workers is roughly equal to the British average of ¬£587 . The constituency was first contested in the 1997 general election. Like all UK Parliament constituencies, it elects one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons using the first-past-the-post voting system. Sleaford and North Hykeham has always elected a Conservative MP. Stephen Phillips was first elected in the 2010 general election and was re-elected in the 2015 general election with a large majority of over 24,000 votes, making the constituency a safe seat for the Conservative Party. Phillips won a majority of 38.9%, followed by the Labour Party in second and UKIP in third. The Liberal Democrat candidate came fourth, while Marianne Overton of the Lincolnshire Independents came fifth and last with 5.2% of the vote (Overton was the only 2015 candidate who also stood in the 2016 by-election). =Previous election resultsBrexit  In a referendum held on 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (EU); approximately 52% of votes cast were in favour of leaving the EU. The UK did not leave the EU immediately; the referendum result led to a period of negotiations between the UK and the EU. The Conservative Party was officially neutral in the referendum, although its leader Prime Minister David Cameron campaigned to remain. As of the day before the referendum, 185 Conservative MPs declared they would vote to remain and 138 declared they would vote to leave. Phillips supported a withdrawal from the EU. The Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats officially supported the continuation of EU membership. UKIP supported the UK's withdrawal from the EU; this was the party's main policy. The result of the EU referendum in Sleaford and North Hykeham is not known because the results were counted in counting areas rather than in constituencies. The researcher Chris Hanretty published estimates of the referendum results from each constituency; he calculated Sleaford and North Hykeham voted 61.6% in favour of leaving the EU. Based on the estimates, the constituency had the 125th-highest vote-share for withdrawal out of the 650 UK Parliament constituencies. Resignation of Stephen Phillips On 3 November 2016, the High Court had ruled the UK could not begin the process of leaving the EU without a parliamentary vote; the government appealed the ruling. The following day, Phillips‚Äî who had favoured Brexit at the 2016 referendum‚Äîresigned over the issue, citing policy differences and criticising the Conservative government under Prime Minister Theresa May for failing to consult Parliament sufficiently over Brexit. Phillips had been critical of May's approach, calling for MPs to have a more decisive role in the Brexit negotiations, and had previously called for an urgent debate on the issue. In the appeal, the Supreme Court later ruled against the government. In his resignation letter to his local Conservative Association, Phillips said; \\"The referendum result gives the government no authority or mandate to adopt a negotiating position without reference to the wishes of the House and those of the British people expressed through their elected representatives\\". He set out three policy areas in which he disagreed with the Government: * \\"its failure to appreciate the constitutional necessity of properly consulting Parliament\\" on leaving the EU; * \\"the continued shirking of our responsibility for unaccompanied child refugees who have been forced to flee war and conflict\\"; and * \\"the way in which international aid is now apparently to be used other than to assist some of the world's poorest and most vulnerable people\\". He concluded by saying \\"It has become clear to me over the last few months that my growing and very significant policy differences with the current government mean that I am unable properly to represent the people who elected me\\". The Daily Telegraph reported that Phillips, who is a lawyer, may have been motivated by disappointment over not being promoted to Attorney General. Phillips' resignation was met with surprise among local councillors and some other Conservative MPs; it came less than two weeks after the Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith resigned in protest of the government's decision to support the expansion of Heathrow Airport. Jon Trickett, a spokesman for the Labour Party, said the series of resignations \\"amount[ed] to a leadership crisis\\" in the Conservative Party. Phillips' resignation triggered a by- election in the constituency, the date of which was not immediately known, though by-elections usually take place within several months of a seat becoming vacant. Candidates and campaign=Candidates The Conservative campaign started on 5 November with a candidate to be chosen on 10 November. Caroline Johnson, a consultant paediatrician who lives near Sleaford, was selected by members of the Sleaford and North Hykeham Conservative Association following a hustings. She defeated the two other finalists, local councillor Lindsay Cawrey and the Conservative Party's regional chairman Kelly Smith. Johnson had stood in Scunthorpe at the 2010 general election, coming second to the Labour candidate. After her selection, Johnson said; \\"I am completely behind the Government's plans for Brexit and to deliver on the decision made by the British people\\". At least four individuals put themselves forth to be UKIP's candidate; the Lincolnshire County Councillors Richard Davies, Robin Hunter-Clarke and Victoria Ayling, and Suzanne Evans‚Äîa candidate in the party's leadership election. Hunter-Clarke and Evans withdrew from the contest on 10 November; Hunter-Clarke said it was not \\"the right time for [him] to seek election to Parliament\\", while Evans withdrew because she would not have been able to stay in the party leadership contest if she had been selected. Ayling was selected on 13 November; she had stood for UKIP in the 2016 Lincolnshire Police and Crime Commissioner election and in the Great Grimsby constituency in 2015. She had previously stood in Great Grimsby in 2010 as the Conservative candidate. In 2013, Ayling was criticised after saying \\"I just want to send the lot back\\" in a video about immigration; she said she was referring to the deportation of illegal immigrants and that her words had been taken out of context. These remarks were brought up during the by-election campaign. The Labour Party selected Jim Clarke, a refuse collector and former postman. The Liberal Democrats selected Ross Pepper, who works for an optician, on 11 November; Pepper stood in Lincoln in the 2015 general election, coming third. Marianne Overton, leader of the Lincolnshire Independents, stood as her party's candidate. Sarah Stock, a campaigner and former nurse, stood as an independent on a \\"Save the NHS\\" (the National Health Service) platform. The Green Party declared it would not be fielding a candidate and instead supported Stock. The other candidates were Peter Hill, standing as The Iconic Arty-Pole for the satirical Official Monster Raving Loony Party; David Bishop of the Bus-Pass Elvis Party; Mark Suffield, a North Kesteven district councillor; and Paul Coyne, a Sleaford Town Councillor: the latter two appeared on the ballot paper with no description. Ten candidates stood in the by-election. Campaign Brexit was the main issue in the by- election. According to Rowena Mason of The Guardian, \\"the main candidates are fighting a battle to appear the most anti-EU, with UKIP leaflets relentlessly painting the Tories as \\"Brexit backsliders\\" and Labour's candidate keen to highlight his willingness to trigger [A]rticle 50 despite having voted to remain. Only the Lib Dem candidate is concentrating on the 40% of voters in the constituency who backed remain last June.\\" UKIP campaigned actively in the by-election despite the Conservative Party's large majority; both the UKIP leader Paul Nuttall and its former leader Nigel Farage visited the constituency as part of the campaign. The party hoped to perform strongly in the by-election due to the high level of support in the constituency for the leaving of the EU; Farage said, \\"[p]eople here voted for Brexit and this is about getting the right deal, which you won't get if people vote Conservative\\". On 5 December, Farage campaigned in front of a poster on which \\"Hykeham\\" was misspelt as \\"Hykenham\\". Ayling criticised Theresa May and the Conservatives for not proceeding quickly enough with Brexit. Jim Clarke, the Labour candidate, opposed Brexit during the referendum campaign but said he would now support it because of the referendum's result. Clarke argued the NHS was the main issue in the by-election, saying many voters had mentioned it to him. Clarke campaigned against the closure of an accident and emergency (A&E;) unit in the area. The Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn visited the constituency and gave a speech while Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, also visited the constituency to support his party's candidate, Ross Pepper. In the Richmond Park by-election that was held one week before the Sleaford vote, the Liberal Democrats won the seat from the former Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith in a substantial swing. The result was seen as a sign of opposition to Brexit because the constituency Richmond Park voted to remain in the EU. The Conservatives were expected to win the Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election. The day before the election, betting odds on the gambling website Betfair had the Conservatives as clear favourites with the odds of their victory being 1/10; UKIP were considered the next most likely to win with odds of 9/1. Results and analysis The election took place on 8 December 2016. The Conservatives received more than half of the votes cast and won a large majority of over 10,000 votes; this was described as \\"one of the party's all-time best by-election performances while in government\\". Turnout in the by-election fell to 37.1%, which was described as \\"remarkably low\\", compared to just over 70% at the 2015 general election. The result was widely seen as poor for the Labour Party, whose vote share decreased by 7%. Labour was placed fourth in the by-election results, having been in second place in the seat in the 2015 general election. Some Labour MPs, including as Jess Phillips‚Äîthe MP for Birmingham Yardley‚Äîblamed the party's stance on Brexit, which tried to appeal to voters on both sides of the Brexit debate, as well as the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. David Winnick, the Labour MP for Walsall North, called the result \\"humiliating\\" and said it could foreshadow an \\"electoral disaster\\" for the party. According to Vernon Coaker, Labour MP for Gedling; \\"Clearly for us, this was not the result we might have hoped for. It was a difficult seat. Let's remember this is a safe Tory seat. UKIP came here expecting to do much better than they did so it's a bad result for them.\\" The result was also considered good for the Liberal Democrats, whose share of the vote increased. Tim Farron, the party's leader, said the result showed his party was the real opposition to the Conservatives. Paul Nutall, the leader of UKIP, said he was happy with Ayling's second-place finish though the party's vote-share declined in comparison with the 2015 general election results. Aftermath Johnson retained her seat at the 2017 and 2019 general elections; on both occasions she won a large majority over the Labour Party candidate, who came second. In 2019, the Conservative majority in the seat was 32,565 votes; this was the largest majority in terms of number of votes of any seat won by the party in the election. The United Kingdom left the European Union on 31 January 2020.
