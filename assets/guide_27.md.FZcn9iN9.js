It began in 1961 in Topanga Canyon, California. The main genre of music is bluegrass, but other acoustic music, folk singing and folk dancing are presented. The contest includes a random mix of beginning, intermediate and advanced players, professional players, string bands and dancers. History The first competition the \\"Banjo Pickers and Open Fiddling Contest\\", created jointly by Margot Slocum and Margaret Jean \\"Peg\\" Engwall Benepe, was a music-only event held in 1961. Twenty-six Five-String Banjo Pickers, five Fiddlers, four Judges and five hundred fans attended that first gathering amid the California Scrub Oak of the Santa Monica Mountains. For the next eight years it was held on the grounds of the 1920s-era \\"Camp Wildwood\\" until a 1969 city ordinance forced a move to large venues. The next nineteen years saw the festival move around Southern California until finally landing at its current location at the Paramount Ranch near Agoura Hills, California, near its origins. The Topanga Banjo‚Ä¢Fiddle Contest was the forerunner of many folk art festivals. Many of Topanga's contestants have gone on to become professional musicians. Numerous stars and musicians have participated, including Jackson Browne, David Lindley, Taj Mahal, John Hartford, Byron Berline, Dan Crary, Frank Hamilton, The Show Ponies, Erik Darling, John Hickman, Stuart Duncan, Peter Tork, and Steve Martin.History of the Topanga Banjo and Fiddle contest, retrieved 2013-08-27 A virtual contest was held in 2020.

Elder (1874‚Äì1935) was a passenger/cargo ship. Originally a U.S. east coast steamer, she was built by John Roach & Sons in Chester, Pennsylvania. The George W. Elder became a west coast steamer in 1876 and served with the Oregon Steamship Company, Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, San Francisco and Portland Steamship Company and the North Pacific Steamship Company. In 1907, the George W. Elder helped to rescue the survivors of her former running mate Columbia. The last owners of the George W. Elder were a Chilean firm which operated her under the name America. She operated the Chilean Coast under this guise until 1935, when she was finally scrapped. The location of her scrapping remains unknown. History The George W. Elder was launched in 1874 at the Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works of John Roach & Sons in Chester, Pennsylvania and first served as a nightboat for the Old Dominion Steamship Company on the New York City to Chesapeake Bay route. She was equipped with brigantine-rig sail configuration and a triple- expansion steam engine rated between and . The George W. Elder drew of water, was long, had a beam of and measured 1,709 gross tons. Due to her design, the George W. Elder was able to visit several different ports. In 1876, the George W. Elder was sold to the Oregon Steamship Company, which brought the ship around Cape Horn and placed her on the San Francisco, California to Portland, Oregon route. The George W. Elder became part of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company fleet after O.R. & N purchased the Oregon Steamship Company. In O.R. & N service, the George W. Elder served alongside the innovative Columbia, which was the first structure to use the incandescent light bulb outside Thomas Edison's laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey.Jehl, Francis Menlo Park reminiscences: written in Edison's restored Menlo Park laboratory, Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, Whitefish, Mass, Kessinger Publishing, 1 July 2002, page 564Dalton, Anthony A Long, Dangerous Coastline: Shipwreck Tales from Alaska to California Heritage House Publishing Company, 1 Feb 2011 ‚Äì 128 pages O.R. & N was bought out by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1898.Belyk, Robert C. Great Shipwrecks of the Pacific Coast. New York: Wiley, 2001. On May 31, 1899, the George W. Elder set out of Seattle, Washington on a scientific exploration voyage to Russia, via British Columbia and Alaska. Although her stopovers were brief, the actions and nature of research done on the George W. Elder followed tradition. The voyage, called the Harriman Expedition, was over long. The George W. Elder was captained by Peter A. Doran during this expedition. After the Harriman Expedition, the United States Army drafted the George W. Elder in November 1899 for use as a troopship in the Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Strangely during this time, the owners of the George W. Elder were listed as Goodall, Perkins & Company, the agents of the Pacific Coast Steamship Company who were the owners of the ill-fated Pacific back in 1875. In December of the same year, she was returned to O.R. & N. In 1904, the George W. Elder was transferred to the newly formed San Francisco and Portland Steamship Company along with the Columbia. During this time, the George W. Elder continued to build on its reputation for being a safe vessel. In 1905 however, this reputation vanished, when the George W. Elder, now 31 years old, struck a rock along the Columbia River and sank under of water. She was raised in May, 1906. After being salvaged, the San Francisco and Portland Steamship Company abandoned her and she was sold in Auction to Captain J.H. Peterson. In 1906, the George W. Elder was sold to the North Pacific Steamship Company, who would be her last American owners. In a chance of coincidence, the George W. Elder was paired the SS Roanoke, which had also been built as a nightboat for the Old Dominion Steamship Company. On July 21, 1907, the former running mate to the George W. Elder, the Columbia collided with the lumber schooner San Pedro off Shelter Cove, California, causing the Columbia to sink, killing 88 people. Among the dead was Captain Peter A. Doran, who had commanded the George W. Elder on her 1899 Harriman Expedition. Both the George W. Elder and Roanoke arrived at the site of the disaster and picked up Columbias survivors from the badly damaged San Pedro. The George W. Elder returned some of the survivors to Astoria, Oregon. The George W. Elder also towed the San Pedro to shore, following the disaster. By 1915, the North Pacific Steamship Company was struggling, due to the loss of their steamer Santa Clara on the bar of Coos Bay, Oregon, in 1914. The management considered closing the company's doors. Thankfully, relief came when the California South Seas Navigation Company chartered both Roanoke and George W. Elder. Neither were used for passenger service under this charter. Unfortunately, the Roanoke capsized and sank off the California coastline, on her second voyage under the charter. Only three people survived. During World War I, the George W. Elder was leased by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, which was at the time owned by the Grace Line. The George W. Elder was used during this time as part of a four ship feeder service for Central American and Mexican ports. At war's end, now 44 years old, the George W. Elder was sold to Artigas Riolrio Compania, based in Valparaiso, Chile, they were to be her last operators. The George W. Elder was renamed America and served the Chilean coastline until 1935. On 7 December 1928, the Chilean cargo ship collided with America and sank. America survived the collision and was reported scrapped in 1935, but it remains uncertain whether the job was done in Japan or Valparaiso. Either way, America had reached an outstanding age of 61 years.

It is located in the Rio Grande valley near the foot of Tome Hill (El Cerro Tom√©), a notable Catholic pilgrimage site. The village lies along New Mexico State Road 47 and is neighbored by Valencia to the north and Adelino to the south. It is the location of the Valencia Campus of the University of New Mexico. Tome has a post office with ZIP code 87060. The population was 1,867 as of the 2010 census. The community was established when land abandoned by Tom√© Dom√≠nguez de Mendoza following the Pueblo Revolt was granted to a new group of settlers in 1739. Once an important town on the Camino Real, it suffered due to Native American attacks and flooding during the 1800s. It was the seat of Valencia County from 1852 to 1872, and again briefly in 1875. For census purposes, Tome was previously combined with Adelino in the Tome-Adelino census-designated place (CDP). The CDP was split prior to the 2010 Census. History Tome was originally part of an encomienda granted to Tom√© Dom√≠nguez de Mendoza in 1659. During the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, Dom√≠nguez fled to El Paso along with the other surviving Spanish settlers, but 38 members of his household were killed. Understandably, he was hesitant to return and remained in El Paso even after the Spanish reconquered New Mexico in 1692. In 1739, a group of 29 settlers from Albuquerque petitioned to take over the abandoned land. Governor Gaspar Domingo de Mendoza granted the request and conveyed to them the Town of Tome Grant. Like other Spanish colonial towns, Tome had a central plaza surrounded by houses and a church. Although plagued by flooding and Native American attacks, it was a notable waypoint on the Camino Real and was frequently mentioned in travelers' accounts. In 1776, Fray Atanasio Dom√≠nguez reported that the town had 727 inhabitants, which made it about the same size as Albuquerque at the time. In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain. By this point Tome was sizable enough to have its own local government with an alcalde (mayor) and ayuntamiento (legislative council). During the Revolt of 1837, counter-revolutionaries led by Manuel Armijo met at Tome to formulate a plan for retaking Santa Fe. In 1852, now under the control of the United States, Tome was designated the county seat of Valencia County. An account of the town was given by U.S. Attorney William W.H. Davis in 1853 as he traveled the territorial District Court circuit: The county seat was moved to Belen from 1872‚Äì4, then back to Tome. In 1875, a new two-story adobe courthouse was built on the plaza with an adjacent stone jail building which is still standing. Despite this brand-new facility, the county seat was moved permanently to Los Lunas the following year. In 1968, the community was divided over whether to sell the land grant, still in force after almost 200 years, to a private developer. Ultimately the land was sold, but the grant was able to reacquire the spiritually significant El Cerro Tome Site in 2013.

His father was of the Neledinsky-Meletsky noble family (descended from a Polish nobleman of the Mielec family), his mother was a princess Kurakina. His mother died early and his father was abroad, so he grew up with his paternal grandmother in Moscow and later, at age 13, he moved to his maternal grandmother, Aleksandra Ivanovna Kurakina, in Petersburg, where he came under the influence of the European Enlightenment and became acquainted with the future tsar Paul. In 1769, he went to the University of Strasbourg, where he studied French, Italian and German. In 1770, he entered the Russian army, participating in the siege of Bender and the Crimea campaign in the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì74). His first published poem was dedicated to the generals under whom he served, Petr Panin and Vasily Dolgoruky. In 1773, he served under Mikhail Kamensky and rose to the rank of 2nd major. After the war, he served under Nicholas Repnin. He retired from the army in 1785 with the rank of colonel. In 1786, he married princess Ekaterina Khovanskaya (1762-1813), with whom he had a son and two daughters, and began to dedicate himself to literature. With the accession of his childhood friend as Paul I in 1796, Neledinsky was given the rank of state councillor, but due to a court intrigue he was removed from office and two years later made senator in Moscow. In 1813, he again moved to Petersburg and became a senator there. Over the next ten years, he was under the protection of empress Maria Feodorovna and became well known as a court poet. He retired in 1826 and moved to Kaluga, where he died two years later. The works of Neledinsky-Meletsky were edited together with those of Anton Delvig in 1850 by A.F. Smirdin. He is not now remembered as a great Russian author of his time; the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary calls him a \\"gifted amateur\\", judging that his works are now only of interest to literary historians, while emphasizing his popularity among his contemporaries; he was praised by Pushkin, and Konstantin Batyushkov called him \\"the Anacreon and Chaulieu of our time\\", setting him above Ippolit Bogdanovich. Among his works that remain known in modern Russia is the \\"folk style\\" poem –ü–µ—Å–Ω—è (\\"A Song\\", 1796; incipit \\"When I go down to the river\\").

The court also heard appeals from British consular courts in Japan. Appeals from the British Court for Japan lay to the British Supreme Court for China and Japan based in the Shanghai International Settlement. Background Britain acquired extraterritorial rights in Japan under the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1858. British Consular officials sat as judges consular courts in all treaty ports in Japan. Until 1865 appeals from decisions of consular officials were made to the Supreme Court of Hong Kong. From 1865 appeals from decisions could be made to the British Supreme Court for China and Japan in Shanghai. Judges of the Shanghai Supreme Court were also empowered to travel to Japan to try cases on circuit. Establishment of Court for Japan In 1871, an attempt was made to establish a branch of the Shanghai Supreme Court in Yokohama by having an acting assistant judge from Shanghai, Nicholas John Hannen, based in Yokohama. Hannen ruled this arrangement to be invalid in 1872.Findlay Richardson & Co vs Pitman & Co, Japan Weekly Mail, 20 July 1872, pp. 445-447 Judges from Shanghai remained in Yokohama but sat as a judge of the Kanagawa Consular Court. In 1877 and 1878 the legality of these arrangements were challenged by the Japanese Government when the acting law secretary, Hiram Shaw Wilkinson, ruled that the import of medicinal opium into Japan was legal.Reg (on the prosecution of the Imperial Customs) vs John Hartley, Japan Times, 2 March 1878 The British Government determined to establish a formal court in Japan. On 1 January 1879 the British Court for Japan was created in Yokohama. The court had had first instance jurisdiction in Kanagawa and appellate jurisdiction from other consular courts in Japan. Appeals from the Court for Japan lay to Supreme Court in Shanghai. Court buildings In Yokohama, the Court for Japan sat in the British Consulate building in Yokohama. The building was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. In other cities, when the Judge of the court went on circuit to outlying cities he would generally sit in courts in British consulate buildings but on occasions where important cases of great public interest were being heard would use other premises. End of extraterritoriality Under the terms of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation signed in 1894, Britain gave up extraterritorial rights in Japan with effect from July 1899. The Court for Japan officially heard its last case, which had been filed before the end of July 1899, in early 1900.Kobe Weekly Chronicle, 17 January 1900, p. 47 Cases The court tried cases of all descriptions, all the time applying the laws of England in Japan, including murder trials before juries, divorce cases, commercial disputes and cases of petty theft. Famous cases were: * The Normanton case where Captain Drake of the Normanton was prosecuted for the manslaughter of 30 Japanese passengers who died on the Normanton when it sank. * The Chishima case where the Japanese government sued the British Government for the loss of a new navy ship, the Chishima. * The trial, in 1897, of Edith Carew for the arsenic poisoning of her husband in Yokohama.North China Herald, 12 February 1897, pp. 259-264A book has also been written on this case. Judges Between 1879 and 1900 the court had 4 full- time judges.Sourced from Foreign Office List entries for each individual The judges were: *Richard Temple Rennie (Judge, Court for Japan, 1879 to 1881) *Nicholas John Hannen (Judge, Court for Japan 1881 to 1891) *Robert Anderson Mowat (Judge, Court for Japan, 1891 to 1897) *Hiram Shaw Wilkinson (Judge, Court for Japan, 1897 to 1900) (also acting Judge 1894-1895) From 1871 to 1877 two judges from Shanghai were based in Yokohama. *Nicholas John Hannen (acting assistant judge 1871-1874) *Charles Wycliffe Goodwin (assistant judge 1874-1877) Between 1865 and 1872, Sir Edmund Grimani Hornby, the Chief Judge of the British Supreme Court for China and Japan also heard cases in Japan when traveling on circuit.

Design and development The Ch-24, Che-26 and Che-29 are braced, parasol wing monoplane flying boats, which differ in the number and type of engines and in their seat numbers. The wings are identical, with no sweep and constant chord out to trapezoidal, upturned tips. Full span, slotted flaperons are fitted. There are two streamlined bracing struts on each side, one from mid-fuselage to about one third span and a shorter, more vertical one from higher on the fuselage. These are assisted by further light struts bracing the rear of the wing centre section via the cabin roof. The engines, one placed centrally on the Ch-24 and two on the other variants are all mounted above and forward of the wing leading edge. The fin, integral with the fuselage, and balanced rudder are swept, tapered and generous. The tailplane is mounted midway up the fin, externally braced from below. Both the rudder and elevators have electrically powered trim tabs. The fuselage, a two step hull design, is a fibreglass structure on all models with the glazed cabin well below the wing underside. The two seat Che-24 and Che-26 have the same length, side by side seats and upward opening doors. The Che-29 is longer and has a second pair of seats behind the first. Fixed wing tip floats, each mounted on parallel pairs of struts, provide stability on water where a water rudder under the fin is used for manoeuvring. All types have the option of an amphibious conventional undercarriage; the small mainwheels are on short cantilever legs which can be rotated upwards out of the water.

It is located to the north of the Chennai‚ÄìArakkonam railway line. It is one of the largest lakes in the western part of the city. Korattur Aeri is one of a chain of three water bodies, including the Ambattur Aeri and the Madhavaram Aeri, where surplus water from one is transported to another. The water from the lake had been supplied to Chennai residents for a brief period when there was a shortage in the late 1970s. However, over the years, the lake has been contaminated with sewage and industrial effluents from surrounding areas such as Pattaravakkam, Athipet and Ambattur. Developments In 2013, the Water Resources Department decided to rejuvenate and beautify the lakes in Ambattur, Madhavaram and Korattur with parks and walkways. The total project costs 600 million. In 2018, the corporation identified and removed about 550 encroachments along the bank of the lake and the bund will be strengthened to a distance of 3 kilometers. Flora and fauna This Lake is an important wildlife refuge in northern and western parts of Chennai, together with the much larger Puzhal Lake and the like-sized Madhavaram Lake and Ambattur Lake. According to the Care Earth Trust, a city-based biodiversity research organisation, nearly 40 bird species are present in these lakes, including common tailorbird, the purple-rumped sunbird, and the migratory Asian openbill stork. A good part of greenery and natural vegetation was present in this lake, even till the last decade. Much natural vegetation once existed in the lake and its bund. Palmyrah, date palm, umbrella thorn trees dot the bund. Inside the lake, water hyacinth is to be seen. This apart, many aquatic vegetation, water lily and wetland rushes are present in the water body. The lake has a multitude of birds, and is a major attraction for wildlife enthusiasts. Large and rare birds like grey pelican, painted stork, Asian openbill, grey heron and large egret occur here. Other birds include divers such as little grebe, common teal, purple swamphen, common moorhen, coot, little cormorant are found. Waders include white-breasted waterhen, Indian pond heron, black-crowned night heron, cattle egret, little egret and rare ones like common snipe, black- winged stilt, chestnut bittern, black bittern and cinnamon bittern. Other rare birds include pheasant-tailed jacana, common kingfisher, white-throated kingfisher and pied kingfisher are also here. Apart from water birds, other birdlife like black-rumped flameback, woodpecker, rose ringed parakeet, black drongo, paddyfield pipit, blue jay, golden oriole, common mynah, Eurasian hoopoe, Indian swiftlet, swallow, coppersmith barbet, green bee-eater, blue- tailed bee-eater, Asian koel, Jacobin cuckoo, coucal and rufous treepie occur here. Birds of prey or raptors such as spotted owlet, black kite, shikra, black-winged kite are to be seen. Threatened reptiles like Indian flapshell turtle, water snakes such as checkered keelback, olive keelback, striped keelback and tree snakes like Daudin's bronzeback and green vine snake and land snakes like common wolf snake, streaked kukri snake and the Oriental ratsnake are found. Even venomous ones like spectacled cobra and common krait occur here, but are rather rare. Lizards such as Oriental garden lizard and skinks like keeled Indian mabuya, bronze mabuya and Lygosoma punctata occur here. Bengal monitor is rare here and is threatened and protected species. Amphibians like green pond frog, skittering frog, Jerdon's bullfrog, Indian bullfrog, Indian tree frog, Asian common toad, ornate narrow-mouthed frog, Microhyla rubra and Ramanella variegata occur here. All of these get very active during monsoon. Mammals are rare here. Earlier, stray occasions of the predatory golden jackal were known. But at present, their existence is doubtful.

Artists Space is a non-profit art gallery and arts organization first established at 155 Wooster Street in Soho, New York City. Founded in 1972 by Irving Sandler and Trudie Grace and funded by the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA), Artists Space provided an alternative support structure for young, emerging artists, separate from the museum and commercial gallery system. Artists Space has historically been engaged in critical dialogues surrounding institutional critique, racism, the AIDS crisis, and Occupy Wall Street. Artists Space has provided a platform for many notable artists, including Laurie Anderson, John Baldessari, Judith Barry, Ericka Beckman, Ashley Bickerton, Barbara Bloom, Andrea Fraser, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Lyle Ashton Harris, Peter Halley, Jenny Holzer, Joan Jonas, Mike Kelley, Jeff Koons, Barbara Kruger, Sherrie Levine, Louise Lawler, Robert Longo, Group Material, Anthony McCall, Ericka Beckman, John Miller, Adrian Piper, Lari Pittman, Tim Rollins, Cindy Sherman, Jack Smith, Michael Smith, Haim Steinbach, Stuart Sherman, Laurie Simmons, and Fred Wilson.  History  During its first year, 21 prominent artists were chosen to produce a one- person exhibition, and chose three unaffiliated artists to show work simultaneously. Artists such as Romare Bearden, Vito Acconci, Dan Flavin, Nancy Graves, Sol LeWitt, Philip Pearlstein, Dorothea Rockburne, Lucas Samaras, and Jack Youngerman were among those chosen to exhibit and select artists. The system provided artists with a great amount of curatorial agency, and the opportunity for emerging artists to gain visibility. Several artists support services were also established early on, including the Visiting Artists Lecture Series, the Emergency Materials Fund, and the Independent Exhibitions Program. These programs were designed to provide visibility and financial assistance to artists, as well as opportunities to exhibit outside of Artists Space. The Emergency Materials Fund provided grants to artists to present their work at an established non-profit venue, while the Independent Exhibitions Program supported the needs of unaffiliated artists who were producing and presenting their work without institutional sponsorship. In 1974, The Unaffiliated Artists File was established, later shortened to the \\"Artists File\\" in 1983. The file was originally composed solely of unaffiliated, New York-based artists, then was expanded to include artists across the United States, and eventually, to include 3000 artists located internationally. The Artists File was both a free database open to the public as well as a service for representing a wide range of independent artists. Artists Space regularly organized group exhibitions entitled Selections, which featured registered artists from the File. The Artists File was one of the largest artists registries in the world, with more than 10,000 users. It was digitized in 1986. = Notable Exhibitions and Programming =  1972‚Äî1979  In 1974, Edit DeAk organized PersonA, a photo and video performance series focusing on autobiography and institutional critique of the art world. Laurie Anderson, Eleanor Anton, Jennifer Bartlett, Dennis Oppenheim, Adrian Piper, Alan Sondheim and Kathy Acker, Peter Hutchinson, Jack Smith, Scott Burton, Roger Welch, and Nancy Kitchell exhibited works. The series took place over four consecutive evenings. In 1977, Douglas Crimp curated Pictures, an exhibition featuring the work of Troy Brauntuch, Jack Goldstein, Sherrie Levine, Robert Longo, and Philip Smith. The show featured multimedia works including photography, film, performance as well as painting, drawing, and sculpture. After first being exhibited at Artists Space, the exhibition traveled to the Allen Art Museum, Oberlin, the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art, and the University of Colorado Museum, Boulder. Crimp stated about the show: > \\"In choosing the word pictures for this show, I hoped to convey not only the > work's most salient characteristic-recognizable images-but also and > importantly the ambiguities it sustains. As is typical of what has come to > be called postmodernism, this new work is not confined to any particular > medium....Picture, used colloquially, is also nonspecific: a picture book > might be a book of drawings or photographs, and in common speech a painting, > drawing, or print is often called, simply, a picture. Equally important for > my purposes, picture, in its verb form, can refer to a mental process as > well as the production of an aesthetic object.\\" In 1978, Artists Space served as a site of inception for the No Wave movement, hosting a punk subculture-influenced noise series. The festival led to the Brian Eno-produced recording No New York, which documented James Chance and the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, and DNA.James Chance interview  Pitchfork In 1979, the gallery hosted an exhibition of black-and- white photographs and charcoal drawings by white artist Donald Newman entitled \\"Nigger Drawings\\". Linda Goode Bryant of Just Above Midtown Gallery and her colleague Janet Henry mobilized a coalition of artists and critics including Lucy Lippard, Carl Andre, May Stevens, Edit DeAk, Faith Ringgold, and Howardena Pindell, who acted as the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition and published an open letter criticizing the exhibition. They also organized two \\"teach-in\\" demonstrations, but only one was successfully held as the gallery locked its doors. Another coalition of artists and critics including Roberta Smith, Laurie Anderson, Rosalind E. Krauss, Craig Owens, Douglas Crimp, and Stephen Koch published an open letter defending the exhibition and the choice of its title. Director Helene Winer argued that the context of the title was not racist in intention, and that art is \\"a territory where everything can be explored, discussed, revalued.‚Äù She apologized, stating, ‚ÄúWe were not politically or socially sensitive to the implications of using that title in a publicly funded art gallery. I feel very badly for those who were legitimately offended.‚Äù Artists from the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition insisted on Artists Space being held accountable for the show in the \\"reality of social- political structure\\", while artist John Chandler called on Artists Space to \\"become the alternative space it is truly meant to be\\" and not \\"mirror the subtle racism that exists throughout the art world.\\"  1980‚Äî1989  In 1987, Artists Space held the exhibition We the People, a group installation of Native American artists, including Pena Bonita, Jimmie Durham, Peter Jemison, Alan Michelson, Jolene Rickard, and Kay Walkingstick. The name was chosen with \\"deliberate irony\\", as the exhibition coincided with the 50th Anniversary of the United States Constitution, the preamble of which had been \\"appropriated from the Iroquois federation\\". The exhibition experimented with the \\"reflection of the [white] colonial ethnographic gaze\\" onto indigenous traditions, and adaptation of new technologies as a result of European settlers. In 1988, Artists Space hosted Min Joong Art: A New Cultural Movement from Korea, an exhibition of multi-disciplinary work and video by South Korean artists, curated by Wan Kyung Sun and Hyuk Um. It was organized to coincide with the Summer 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea. The title of the exhibition translates to \\"art of the people\\", and represented a \\"counterpoint to the abstract and minimal work exhibited in the extensive cultural exhibitions planned for the Olympics.\\" In 1989, Nan Goldin curated the exhibition Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing at Artists Space, bringing together works from her friends that were impacted by the AIDS epidemic. About the exhibition, Goldin stated, \\"Over the past year four more of my most beloved friends have died of AIDS. Two were artists I had selected for this exhibit. One of the writers for this catalogue has become too sick to write. And so the tone of the exhibition has become less theoretical and more personal, from a show about AIDS as an issue to more of a collective memorial.\\" After one of the artists, David Wojnarowicz, published an essay criticizing right wing politicians for failing to fund HIV research and effectively furthering the spread of AIDS, the National Endowment for the Arts withdrew their $10,000 grant for the exhibition. The grant was later partially re-issued.  1990‚Äî1999  In 1990, Cornelia Butler and Micki McGee organized A Day Without Art, where the gallery closed its regular exhibitions to present a one-day video program and installation investigating the body and the body politic in relation to medical, ethical, and social conditions of AIDS treatment. In 1991, the exhibition Japan: Outside/Inside/InBetween was a three-part video program investigating representations of Japan. In 1992, A New World Order: Part I: Choice Histories: Framing Abortion was a group installation on reproductive rights in the United States, organized by REPOhistory. In 1996, Artists Space presented Mr. Dead & Mrs. Free: A History of Squat Theatre (1969-1991), collaborating with its founding members Eva Buchm√ºller and Anna Ko√≥s to produce a retrospective of its work.  2000‚Äî2009  In June 2003, Artists Space hosted a survey of architect Zaha Hadid‚Äôs work as part of the Architecture and Design Project series. The show featured both completed and conceptualized projects by Hadid, and coincided with the opening of her commissioned Price Arts Tower in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. From November to December 2003, Artists Space organized Superstudio: Life without Objects in collaboration with the Pratt Manhattan Gallery and the Storefront for Art and Architecture. The show explored the work of Superstudio, an Italian avant-garde architecture and design group that was influential to the radical period of the 1960s and 1970s in Italy.  2010‚Äî2018  In 2010, Artists Space hosted Danh Vo's first exhibition in the United States, entitled Autoerotic Asphyxiation. In 2011, Artists Space offered its resources to movements like Strike Debt and Working Artists and the Greater Economy (W.A.G.E), holding a series of lectures and meeting inciting dialogue on art's indisputable relation to politics. Artists Space formed a research partnership with W.A.G.E that led to the development of W.A.G.E's current certification program, which credits non-profit art organizations that commit to paying artists fees that meet their minimum payment standards. In 2015, Artists Space presented a survey of Hito Steyerl's work from 2004 onwards, displayed across both its main gallery and Books & Talks location. The self-titled exhibition also encompassed lectures and film screenings, and also hosted various pieces of Steyerl's writing online. From January to March 2016, Artists Space hosted the exhibition 91020000 by Cameron Rowland, wherein Rowland purchased various units from an affordable manufacturing company named Corcraft that relies on underpaid prison labor. The exhibition title referred to the gallery's customer account number: 91020000. For another work, Disengorgement, Rowland purchased 90 shares of Aetna, who previously issued slave insurance to slaveowners in order to establish the ‚ÄúReparations Purpose Trust.‚Äù The trust states that it is to be held until ‚Äúthe effective date of any official action by any branch of the United States government to make financial reparations for slavery.‚Äù From September to December 2016, Decolonize This Place conducted a residency at Artists Space, where the Books & Talks location (55 Walker Street) functioned as a headquarters and meeting place for artists and organizers across New York City, many of whom were tied to decolonial resistance at national and global scales. In 2018, just before the closing of its 55 Walker Street location, Artists Space hosted Jack Smith: Art Crust of Spiritual Oasis, the first institutional retrospective of Jack Smith's work in over 20 years. = Locations = * 155 Wooster Street (1972‚Äì1977) * 105 Hudson Street (1977‚Äì1984) * 223 West Broadway (1984‚Äì1993) * 38 Greene Street (1993‚Äì2016) * 55 Walker Street (2016‚Äì2018) * 80 White Street (2019) = Timeline of Directors = * Trudie Grace (1973‚Äì1975) * Helene Winer (1975‚Äì1980) * Linda Shearer (1980‚Äì1985) * Susan Wyatt (1985‚Äì1991) * Carlos Gutierrez-Solana (1991‚Äì1993) * Claudia Gould (1994‚Äì1999) * Barbara Hunt (2000‚Äì2005) * Benjamin Weil (2005‚Äì2008) * Stefan Kalm√°r (2009‚Äì2016) * Jay Sanders (2017‚Äìpresent) See also *Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics *White Columns *Mudd Club *Tier 3 References External links *Official website *Guide to the Artists Space Archive: 1973-2009 at Fales Library and Special Collections at New York University *Guide to the Artists Space Collection of Artist Files, Fales Library and Special Collections at New York University Category:Contemporary art galleries in the United States Category:1972 establishments in New York (state) Category:Art galleries in Manhattan Category:Art galleries established in 1972 Category:Culture of New York City Category:Tribeca ","title":"Artists Space"},{"id":"40275526","text":"Luk√°≈° Dlouh√Ω and Michal Merti≈à√°k were the defending champions, but decided not to participate.

It starred Arundhati Nag as Manjula Nayak and her doppelg√§nger in the Kannada and Hindi versions while Arundhati Raja played the same role in the English version. The plot revolves around the protagonist Manjula Nayak who is an unsuccessful writer in Kannada and finds success with her novel written in English. Her doppelg√§nger later questions her about her choice to write in English rather than in her own language and the betrayal of her own language. The play earned itself positive reviews which subsequently resulted in a new production of it in English which was directed by Alyque Padamsee and featured Shabana Azmi playing the lead role of Manjula Sharma, a Hindi writer who is unsuccessful. The play won the awards for Best Playwright and Best Director while Nag won the Best Actress award for her role at the Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Awards in 2008. Karnad got the idea to write the play when he attended a talk in Bangalore by Shashi Deshpande, daughter of Kannada writer Shriranga, on Indian writers who wrote in English not being treated on par with English writers of foreign origin. The play was originally performed at Bangalore.

It is also known as the Penang Rubber Trade Association. Background The oldest surviving rubber trade body from British Malaya is the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce Rubber Association,Official website of the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce Rubber Association formed at a special general meeting of the (then) Singapore Chamber of Commerce and Exchange, at the Exchange Room on 20 June 1911.The Straits Times, 12 June 1911, Page 5The Straits Times, 21 June 1911, Page 7 From its first auction on 12 September till the end of that year, the Singapore Chamber of Commerce Rubber Association held 12 auctions. 52 auctions were held in 1912.The Straits Times, 24 February 1913, Page 8 Shortly after, in 1913, the Penang Chamber of Commerce formed a Rubber Association to provide a market for this principal article of local agriculture through weekly auction sales. It was envisaged that large supplies of rubber would be attracted and that there would be regular buyers.The Straits Times, 26 June 1913, Page 9 When the idea for the Rubber Association was first mooted, Allen Dennys & Co., who had already been performing auctions in Penang since November 1912, in an earlier circular to their clients, asked them to favour the firm by appointing them as their agents, promising to defray all fees due to The Chamber out of the 1 per cent commission charged.28 October 1912, Page 7The Straits Times, 19 May 1913, Page 11 The first auction was held on 12 November where 24,707 lbs. were offered of which 22,882 lbs were sold.The Straits Times, 14 November 1913, Page 9 In January 1915, at the annual general meeting of the Penang Chamber of Commerce, Messrs. Allen Dennys and Company asked for a fixed fee of $5 be paid in respect of each occasion a seller conducts a sale in the chamber, instead of the prevailing brokerage of one- eighth percent, pointing out that the firm had been the sole supporter of the association and that 91.50 percent of the fees had been borne by them. The committee discussing the issue, objected, pointing out that while the facts relating to the percentage of fees were admitted, that percentage it was also necessary to acknowledge that the business had increased by more than 150 percent since the start of the association fourteen months earlier. At this point Allen Dennys and Company withdrew from membership in the association, which brought sales in the association room to a halt. Other members were called upon to step forward and fill the place vacated by Allen Dennys and Company.The Straits Times, 23 January 1915, Page 10 In August 1915, at the half-yearly general meeting chaired by John Mitchell, it was revealed that the position remained the same as advised at the general meeting earlier - no member had come forward with any propositions and the committee had not taken any steps to re-establish sales under the Penang Chamber of Commerce Rubber Association.The Straits Times, 21 August 1915, Page 10 There was nothing more heard on the subject and the interests of members of Penang's rubber trade remained unrepresented until the advent of the Rubber Trade Association of Penang, in the form of its original incarnation, The Penang Rubber Exchange. Allen Dennys' firm, however, continued to hold rubber auctions, on their own. By late February 1917, the firm had conducted its 258th sale.The Straits Times, 26 February 1917, Page 10 The results of each of the firm's rubber auctions was published in the Straits Times, the last of which appeared in the issue of 18 May 1918.The Straits Times, 18 May 1918, Page 8 Chronology of Early History * The Penang Rubber Exchange was established in 1919 by Khor Ewe-Keng who was also a trustee of the organisation.The Straits Times, 21 May 1939, Page 3Drabble, J.

He was a rubber auctioneer, shipping agent and property assessor. He came to Malaya when only 16 years of age, arriving at Singapore in 1887 where he joined the shipping department of Boustead & Co, a firm he remained with for eight years. From there he took up appointment as manager of W. Mansfield & Co.'s Penang branch, six years after that he joined Wooldridge & Co. where his brother was working. He eventually acquired that firm which was renamed Allen Dennys & Co. Allen Dennys & Co. grew from a tiny operation with six native clerks to become one of the leading firms in Penang, employing two Europeans, thirty other assistants and several hundred coolies, with a fleet of twenty-five lighters continually employed, and godowns capable of storing 14,000 tons of cargo. The firm was acquired, in 1920 by The Borneo Co., officially assuming the management of the Penang Branch of the Borneo Co. Ltd., during the absence on leave of F. E.

In appreciation for this gift, the Commander of the Local Defence Corps said that the name of the Penang Rubber Exchange, in English and in Chinese, would be inscribed on the canteen.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 13 October 1941, Page 5 * In May 1946 the Penang Rubber Exchange decided to make representations to the Chief Secretary of the Malayan Union (1) To fix the date for the restoration of Penang's free port status, and not to tax goods already in Penang; and (2) To ask that rubber duties be paid only at Butterworth and Prai, where customs houses had been opened.The Straits Times, 24 May 1946, Page 5 In early June a petition was sent to the Assistant Comptroller of Customs and Excise pointing out that excise duty levied on Penang \\"constitutes an injustice to the local rubber trade.\\" The body alleged that \\"large consignments of rubber, which ordinarily were forwardrd to Penang for sale,\\" had been \\"diverted to Singapore to the detriment of Penang's interests\\" as a result of the excise duty then being imposed. The Exchange asked that Penang, being a free port, should enjoy the same privilege as Singapore where no tax was being collected.The Singapore Free Press, 7 June 1946, Page 5 * European rubber dealers and packers in Penang and Province Wellesley, through the Penang Chamber of Commerce, agreed to back the Penang Rubber Exchange in any revised scale of handling that The Exchange might propose to labourers.The Straits Times, 11 June 1947, Page 5 * At the end of May 1947, the Penang Rubber Exchange called a meeting ro discuss the steps to be taken in view of the decline in the price of rubber.The Straits Times, 30 May 1947, Page 5 Towards the end of June, the Penang Rubber Exchange together with the Rubber Committee of the Penang Chamber of Commerce presented a revised scale of rates to Penang Harbour labourers. The new rates were 60 percent of the prevailing packing charges and 50 percent of handling and sampan charges. The proposed cost-cutting was relayed by Penang Rubber Exchange Chairman, Saw Seng-Kew to the port labourers through the Penang Harbour Labour Association and the Deputy Commissioner of Labour, Penang.The Straits Times, 26 June 1947, Page 1 * In early July N. L. Alexander, the Deputy Commissioner of Labour, called for a meeting between the Penang Rubber Exchange and the Penang Harbour Labour Association whose delegates informed those of The Exchange that, while no final strike decision had been taken, the reduced rates proposed by The Exchange and the Penang Chamber of Commere, had been rejected.The Straits Times, 7 July 1947, Page 5 Koh Pheah-Teng, Secretary of The Exchange acknowledged the rejection and said The Exchange appreciated the supporting grounds put forward by the labourers that (1) with rubber prices declining there was less work to be done and therefore less income to be had by the dock workers and (2) the cost of living had risen with the increased price of rationed foodstuff and workers were having a difficult time scraping by. He said, however, that handling charges in Penang were more than double the prevailing rates in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Perak and Kedah, as a result of which rubber originally intended for Penang had been diverted to other ports - North Perak and Kedah dealers saved on the higher handling charges in Penang by sending their rubber to Province Wellesley, for example. Pheah-Teng said that if labour costs were reduced, it would be the labourers themselves, and not just the rubber dealers who would benefit from the greater flow of trade through the island's port.The Straits Times, 8 July 1947, Page 4 * The Exchange accepted an offer by the Penang Federation of Trade Unions to mediate in the dispute over rubber handling charges. The offer was accepted.The Straits Times, 11 July 1947, Page 5 * By the middle of July, three out of five rubber factories in Penang had suspended operations owing to the low price of rubber and the corresponding relatively high cost of labour. Traders were concerned that unless steps were taken to reduce port labour costs, Penang might lose the trade altogether. An official of The Exchange pointed out that while packing charges in Kuala Lumpur amounted to $1.10 a bale, Penang labourers were charging as much as $2.13 a bale. If costs could be reduced, Penang could protect its trade.The Straits Times, 16 July 1947, Page 1 * By the end of July the idea for Penang first Employers' Union was mooted at a meeting at the Penang Rubber Exchange. Membership was open to all rubber dealers and exporters in Penang and Province Wellesley. The intent was to organise employers in the rubber trade to deal collectively with all matters affecting the industry including seeking a new approach to labour problems.The Straits Times, 29 July 1947, Page 4 * Rubber exports from Penang continued its steep drop in July. Exports in May were $23,000,000 down to $16,487,326 in June and $8,955,655 in July.The Straits Times, 25 August 1947, Page 5 * At a meeting on 4 September 1947, presided over by the Chairman of the Penang Chamber of Commerce, D. A. Mackay, 100 merchants unanimously adopted a resolution to form an Employers' Association. Trade Union Adviser, R. Chaddick was present and addressed the meeting. If tonnage for various commodities had been declining and that increasing quantities of rubber was being packed on the mainland and going south for shipment instead of passing through Penang, and thus depriving Penang's workers of employment, and if hgh handling charges forced commodities elsewhere then it was only a matter of time before Penang became seriously affected, it was acknowledged.The Straits Times, 6 September 1947, Page 4 * Towards the end of September, the newly formed Penang Rubber Trader's Association appointed a three-man sub-committee to draw up labour rates for adoption by the rubber industry in Penang: Chairman, R. B Hussey; Vice-Chairman, Heah Joo-Seang; and Secretary, Khaw Pheah-Teng.The Straits Times, 24 September 1947, Page 5 * Penang Island was gradually losing its trade to Province Wellesley. 60 percent of rubber stocks in Penang port were stacked in Butterworth godowns. In September, rubber listed as \\"port stocks\\" totalled 22,609 tons - a 6,529-ton increase over August - of which 11,602 tons were in Penang, 6,926 tons in Butterworth godowns and 4,676 tons on Penang Island. Figures for the whole of Malaya put total \\"dealers stocks\\" in the country at 78,072 tons, a 5,394-ton increase over August.The Straits Times, 16 October 1947, Page 4 * By the beginning of October the Chinese and Indian sections of the Harbour Labour Union began revising their scale of handling charges prompted by the action taken by employers to reduce high labour charges in Penang.The Straits Times, 3 October 1947, Page 6 * A delegation from Penang was sent to Kuala Lumpur for a discussion with Sir Edward Gent on the economic facts relating to Penang trade and the effect of Government control. Headed by Penang's Resident Commissioner, S. N. King,the delegation also included representatives of the Penang Chamber of Commerce and the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce. One of the things on the table was the unfair imposition of export duty at Penang while Singapore was free of this constraint, another, the loss of trade that was leaving the island and going over to Province Wellesley.The Straits Times, 13 October 1947, Page 4 * In the middle of October Lee Eng-Thye, President of the Penang Harbour Labour Association announced a reduction in existing labour rates and working regulations. He told Chinese and Indian merchants, however, that the main obstacle to Penang's prosperity was not excessive handling rates but that the free port of Penang was not really \\"free.\\"The Straits Times, 15 October 1947, Page 6 * By the end of October the Penang Chamber of Commerce's Rubber Traders' Association informed the Penang Harbour Labour Union that the former will enforce its revised tariff of rates from 1 November as the prevailing labour rates were so high they were diminishing Penang's rubber trade day after day.The Straits Times, 31 October 1947, Page 5 * Towards end November, representatives of the Penang Harbour Labour Association whose rubber workers were then on strike, met with Resident Commissioner S. N. King, giving the latter an account of the events leading to the strike which, by then, had entered its tenth day, and had brought Penang's rubber trade to a standstill. The Resident Commissioner undertook to put the views of the labourers before the Rubber Traders' Association and the Employers Association.The Straits Times, 27 November 1947, Page 7 * Elliot H. Simpson, President of New York's E. H. Simpson and Co. Inc. established a truce between workers and employers in the dispute over handling charges and succeeded in persuading workers to return to their jobs after a two-week strike. He noted that workers were under the misapprehension that employers were exploiting them and were making a lot of money at the expense of labourers which was untrue. In fact very little money had been made by exporters due to the tremendous drop in the price of rubber from US 26 cents before to 13 cents and many dealers had lost money as evidenced by the number of failures among rubber producers during the past few months.The Straits Times, 1 December 1947, Page 5 * Three days after the truce, workers resumed their strike.The Straits Times, 5 December 1947, Page 3 * By the middle of December the, by then, three-week strike in Penang rubber godowns ended when workers accepted a compromise settlement in the dispute with the Rubber Traders' Association over handling rates. By then both rubber dealers and labourers had suffered severe loss as a result of the strike.The Straits Times, 12 December 1947, Page 9 * In July 1949 The Exchange cabled details of a plan to help the Malayan rubber industry, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Whitehall. A dollar premium on a 20 percent refund of American dollar receipts for rubber shipments to the United States - to be used for the import of American goods - would stimulate exports to the US, increase the price of rubber in Malaya and add to the country's dollar earnings for the Empire Pool, the proposal reasoned. The proposal, signed by Heah Joo-Seang was addressed to the Commissioner-General, Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, the High Commissioner, Sir Henry Gurney, and the Penang Resident Commissioner, A. V. Aston.The Straits Times, 20 July 1949, Page 8 * In 1951 the Penang Rubber Exchange became officially known as the Rubber Trade Association of Penang, sanctioned by the Registrar of Societies.The Straits Times, 14 April 1951, Page 5 * In September The Association moved to their new premises at Anson Road. The official opening of their new premises was held on 15 September, and a commemorative booklet was issued.PRTA (1951) Souvenir Number in Commemoration of the Rubber Trade Association of Penang and the Official Opening of Their New Premises, 16 Anson Road on 15 September 1951 * In 1951, the Government of the Federation of Malaya established, under the Rubber Shipping and Packing Control Ordinance of 1950, the Malayan Rubber Export Registration Board. The Penang Rubber Trade Association was one of the organisations appointed, by Government, to The Board and The Association nominated its president, Heah Joo-Seang, to represent its interests. Other organisations appointed to the board, and their representatives were: the Singapore Chamber of Commerce Rubber Association (I. G. Salmond and F. I. Waterhouse), the Singapore Chinese Rubber Dealers' Association (Lee Kong-Chian and Tan Puay Hee), the Penang Chamber of Commerce (R. Kirkpatrick), the F.M.S. Chamber of Commerce (C. H. Fell), the United Planting Association of Malaya (J. M. Mason), the Malayan Estate Owners' Association (Yong Shook-Lin), with Sheik Ahmad bin Sheik Mustapha representing smallholders and Lim Chong-Chee representing rubber dealers not otherwise represented. The Chairman was J. C. Cobbett.The Straits Times, 2 November 1951, Page 7 * Protesting actions taken by the American Government that The Association deemed against the interests of the natural rubber industry, The Association urged the British Government, through the Member of Parliament for Economic Affairs, O. A. Spencer, to take early action. The British Government was urged to make clear to the American Government, that their actions had threatened the sound basis of the industry, were unfriendly and unreasonable and calculated to jeopardise Malaya's economic structure. These were (1) Enforcement of the rejection clause in purchase contracts and limitation of purchases only to certain stock grades; (2) Refusal to buy more natural rubber for stockpiling purposes and freeing the rubber market \\"only in name\\"; (3) Reduction of the selling price of synthetic rubber and exportation of fair quantities in active competition with natural rubber; and (4) Introduction of a programme to expand further the production of synthetic by another 100,000 tons a year together with restrictions on the usage of natural rubber to a minimum figure. \\"We feel the time has come for the British Government to take action to save the rubber industry in Malaya,\\" President Heah Joo-Seang informed The Straits Times.The Straits Times, 14 March 1952, Page 4 * In April 1952, The Association, writing to rubber trade associations in 11 states and settlements, initiated the formation of a national body to represent the united interests of all rubber traders in Malaya. President Heah Joo-Seang was reported to have said, \\"the time has come for the rubber trade in this country to get together and speak with one voice.\\"The Straits Times, 9 April 1952, Page 5 * In 1952, the Rubber Trade Association of the Federation of Malaya was formed and held its inaugural meeting, on Monday, 2 June 1952, at the premises of the Penang Rubber Trade Association.The Straits Times, 30 May 1952, Page 9 * In October, The Association celebrated its 33rd anniversary in conjunction with the Chinese mid-Autumn festival.The Straits Times, 3 October 1952, Page 10 * By the end of 1953 the world had produced 2,652,500 tons of rubber and consumed 2,432,500 tons and The Association estimated, then, that for 1954 production would drop to 2,652,500 tons and consumption to 2,320,000. There was a shortage of slab rubber resulting in several factories in Penang becoming idle and, consequently, a workers employed in the rubber business in Penang, became unemployed. Adding to this, Penang's barter trade with Indonesia had nearly come to a standstill - Penang depended on imports from Myanmar (then Burma) and Indonesia. It was important to find ways to boost consumption and the Association moved to hold a meeting in Singapore in April 1954 to improve relations between Malayan rubber exporters and packers, and American importers and manufacturers.The Straits Times, 5 March 1954, Page 5 * During the last quarter of 1952 a Malayan Federation Trade Mission to China, its rubber section headed by Tan Boon-Peng, Secretary of The Association, successfully introduced a new grade of rubber based on samples produced by the Penang Rubber Trade Association, 3,000 tons of which was purchased by the China National Import and Export Corporation.The Straits Times, 19 November 1956, Page 5 * Heah Joo-Seang was unanimously re-elected President at the annual meeting of The Association in April 1957.The Straits Times, 22 April 1957, Page 5 * In March 1958 The Association decided to give its entire library, comprising around 2,000 books valued at $3,000, to the Penang Chinese Girl's High School.The Straits Times, 6 March 1958, Page 4 * In February 1962, following a meeting between the Government of the Federation of Malaya and Penang rubber interests which decided to restore the method of trade between Penang and Indonesia to that existing before 1 December 1961, The Association appointed an 11-man sub-committee to be responsible for the payment of duty and cesses on rubber produced on Penang Island. Its President, Heah Joo-Seang was appointed advisor to the sub-committee comprising the following elected members: Tan Boon-Peng, Lee Guat Cheow, Khor Piah-Teng (Khaw Pheah-Teng), Tan Hoay-Eam, Khoo Hock-Thye, Chan Hor-Swee, Chew Chan-Seng, Lye Cheok-Sam, Tan Cheng-Hooi, Saw Seng-Kew and Loh Say-Bee. The meeting between the Federal Government and Penang's rubber trade had been called following representations by local traders against the enforcement of the Rubber Export Duty (Penang) Act 1962 which took effect on 1 January 1962. Speaking to those present at The Association, Joo-Seang said the new system agreed to had produced immediate results ‚àí 2,000 tons of rubber had been imported into Penang after agreement was reached the previous week with 6,000 to 7,000 tons more expected in the next few days. The new arrangement had safeguarded Penang's free port status and rubber from Indonesia could now be imported freely ‚àí Indonesian traders had previously threatened to divert all shipments to Singapore. That would have lost Penang its traditional entrepot trade with that country ‚àí over 40,000 tons of Indonesian rubber being imported into Penang annually in previous years ‚àí which would have had serious repercussions on employment. Having had the situation explained to them, unanimous support was given for the new arrangements i.e. noduty or cesses would be payable when exporting rubber from Penang Island, Customs would cease weighing rubber imported into Penang, Government would estimate the quantity of rubber expected to be produced in Penang Island each year, and the estimate to be revised from year to year.The Straits Times, 5 February 1962, Page 9 Closely connected to the Malaysian Rubber Board) * The Penang Rubber Trade Association was a founding member of the historical form of the company that came to be known, in 1996, as the Malaysian Rubber Board. * In January 1962, the House of Representatives (Dewan Rakyat) passed the Malaya Rubber Exchange (Incorporation) Bill.The Straits Times, 27 January 1962, Page 11 The Bill provided for the establishment of a rubber market in Malaya and the formation of a Company set up and carrying on the business of a clearing house or settlement house, or both, to facilitate mercantile business, deal with all questions connected with the trade, marketing and distribution of rubber and the encouragement of research in the uses of rubber. It was also envisaged that the company act as arbitrators, or appoint arbitrators and umpires to mediate and settle disputes affecting rubber deals. The main object of the newly formed Malayan Rubber Exchange was identified as the promotion and development of the Malayan rubber industry, and the Penang Rubber Trade Association and its interests were represented through its ordinary membership in the new entity, these were further safeguarded through the appointment, by Government, of its President, Heah Joo-Seang to the Board of Directors of the new entity. Cheah Ewe-Keat, director of Harper Gilfillan a& Co. was selected Chairman of the Board of Directors of the new entity with Tee Teh, President of the Federation of Rubber Traders' Association as his Deputy Chairman. Other directors named were: J. Brown, Chan Chong-Wen, Heah Joo-Seang, J. L. Landolt, Leong Hoe-Yeng, Lim Yee-Teck, Tan Siow-Hoon, Yeap Ghee-Chuan, and Lew Sip-Hon.

Plot A rich yet hideously deformed youth named Matula (Ferry Kock) visits a dukun (shaman) named Tello, asking to be made handsome. Tello agrees, then does the deed. When Matula asks him to name his price, Tello asks to be paid with a soul. Using his magic, Tello arranges for Emma (Dewi Mada), the daughter of a rich businessman, to meet Matula in a plantation, where Matula can convince her to come with him. Upon realising what is happening, Emma's father Johan and her fianc√© Paul chase down Matula. They are too late, as Tello has taken Emma's soul. The four men fight, and though Paul's soul is almost taken, Johan is able to defeat Tello with a bamboo shaft. Defeated, Tello returns Emma's soul. Matula returns to his original form, reeking of death; Tello then demands his soul.; . Production Matula was produced by The Teng Chun for Action Film, a subsidiary of his company New Java Industrial Film. It was directed by Tan Tjoei Hock, a former theatre assistant, who had worked who had made his directorial debut the preceding year with Dasima; Tan also handled cinematography.; . Music was handled by Mas Sardi. It was written by Ferry Kock (who also starred), a former stage actor with the touring troupe Dardanella who had made his film debut in 1940 with Rentjong Atjeh. The black- and-white film also starred Dewi Mada, Mohamad Mochtar, and Bissu. Release and reception Matula was released in 1941, reaching Surabaya by late January. Open to audiences aged 17 and older, it was advertised as \\"a film of black magic (guna-guna), action, and romance\\". A review in the Surabaya-based Soerabaijasch Handelsblad stated that the film was \\"in every way successful\\", particularly praising Kock's performance. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

Unlike clustering algorithms such as -means or -medoids, affinity propagation does not require the number of clusters to be determined or estimated before running the algorithm. Similar to -medoids, affinity propagation finds \\"exemplars,\\" members of the input set that are representative of clusters. Algorithm Let through be a set of data points, with no assumptions made about their internal structure, and let be a function that quantifies the similarity between any two points, such that iff is more similar to than to . For this example, the negative squared distance of two data points was used i.e. for points and , s(i,k) = - \\\\left\\\\ x_i - x_k \\\\right\\\\^2 The diagonal of (i.e. s(i,i)) is particularly important, as it represents the instance preference, meaning how likely a particular instance is to become an exemplar. When it is set to the same value for all inputs, it controls how many classes the algorithm produces. A value close to the minimum possible similarity produces fewer classes, while a value close to or larger than the maximum possible similarity produces many classes. It is typically initialized to the median similarity of all pairs of inputs. The algorithm proceeds by alternating between two message-passing steps, which update two matrices: * The \\"responsibility\\" matrix has values that quantify how well-suited is to serve as the exemplar for , relative to other candidate exemplars for . * The \\"availability\\" matrix contains values that represent how \\"appropriate\\" it would be for to pick as its exemplar, taking into account other points' preference for as an exemplar. Both matrices are initialized to all zeroes, and can be viewed as log-probability tables. The algorithm then performs the following updates iteratively: * First, responsibility updates are sent around: r(i,k) \\\\leftarrow s(i,k) - \\\\max_{k' eq k} \\\\left{ a(i,k') + s(i,k') \\\\right} * Then, availability is updated per ::a(i,k) \\\\leftarrow \\\\min \\\\left( 0, r(k,k) + \\\\sum_{i' ot\\\\in {i,k}} \\\\max(0, r(i',k)) \\\\right) for i eq k and ::a(k,k) \\\\leftarrow \\\\sum_{i' eq k} \\\\max(0, r(i',k)). Iterations are performed until either the cluster boundaries remain unchanged over a number of iterations, or some predetermined number (of iterations) is reached. The exemplars are extracted from the final matrices as those whose 'responsibility + availability' for themselves is positive (i.e. (r(i,i) + a(i,i)) > 0). Applications The inventors of affinity propagation showed it is better for certain computer vision and computational biology tasks, e.g. clustering of pictures of human faces and identifying regulated transcripts, than -means, even when -means was allowed many random restarts and initialized using PCA. A study comparing affinity propagation and Markov clustering on protein interaction graph partitioning found Markov clustering to work better for that problem. A semi-supervised variant has been proposed for text mining applications. Software * A Java implementation is included in the ELKI data mining framework. * A Julia implementation of affinity propagation is contained in Julia Statistics's Clustering.jl package. * A Python version is part of the scikit-learn library. * An R implementation is available in the \\"apcluster\\" package.

He was a pioneer of electron optics and laid the theoretical basis for the electron microscope. From 1904 to 1905 he studied physics in Strasbourg, from 1905 to 1906 in Berlin and from 1907 to 1911 physics and applied physics in G√∂ttingen. He then was assistant for applied electrical engineering in G√∂ttingen. He received his doctorate in 1911 from the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1920 he habilitated from the same university and was then Privatdozent of physics and applied physics. In 1921 he was Privatdozent in Jena. In 1922 he became associate professor in Jena. In 1929 he became professor at the Technical University of Berlin. In 1930 he became Professor in Electrical Engineering at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt (TH Darmstadt) and from 1933 to 1934 the rector of the university. From 1937 to 1939 and 1944 to 1947 he was the Dean of the Department of Electrical Engineering of the TH Darmstadt. Busch became a Patron Member of the SS. In 1940 Busch and his team started to work on data transmission in Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center. For this work he received the War Merit Cross in 1942. From 1944 to 1945 he was at the same time Dean of the Department of Mechanical Engineering. In 1952 he became professor emeritus. Ernst Ruska read a paper by Busch in the academic journal Archives Elektrotechnik where Busch suggested that magnetic fields could be used to direct beams of electrons analogous to the way light is refracted by optical lenses. His proof that a small angle electron beam can be focused to a point by an cylindrical magnetic lens was the basis for the development of the transmission electron microscope by Ruska and Knoll. In recognition of his work in the field, Busch was unanimously elected an honorary fellow of the German Society for Electron Microscopy at its first meeting in 1949.

The station is composed of open grassland and saltbush with no salt lakes or heavy scrub all divided into 44 well fenced paddocks that respond quickly after rain. The property has a machinery shed, a six stand woolshed, with extensive weldmesh yards and a drafting facility and is fenced with of fencing. No surface water sources exist and bores are used to water stock. There are a total of 12 bores with of piping to distribute water about the property. Arrubiddy was established in 1961 along with other properties in the area including Rawlinna, Kanandah and Moonera Stations then later Kybo and Balgair were established. The current homestead was built in 1969, constructed from brick and has three bedrooms, one bathroom and two loungerooms. Another cottage exists near the homestead with quarters for another twenty staff with mess facilities, known as the shearers quarters. There is a two bedroom cottage also located near the homestead for an oversear. There is also a three bedroom house located near the highway for another staff member and their family The Brown family took over at Arubiddy in the 1970s and continued to improve the property. In 2003 a field trial involving the making of hay out of the native grass, speargrass (Austrostipa scabra), at Kanandah station had bales sent to Arubiddy to be used as feed for wethers. The station owners and managers, the Brown family, conducted the trial and found the feed to have environmental and economic benefits.

Her resignation was accepted by the board. An investigation by the AHPRA found that Dr Alevanki entered the premises of the hospital without the permission of the facility.

The Master of the Brunswick Diptych (fl. c. 1480-1510) was a Dutch early Renaissance painter. Life and works Nothing is known for certain about the anonymous master. Some scholars have attempted to identify the artist as Jacob van Haarlem, who is documented as having lived and worked in Haarlem from 1483 to 1509 and may have been a teacher to Jan Mostaert, but this remains a speculation. The anonymous master is named after a diptych in Brunswick, depicting Mary with an infant Jesus, Saint Anne and, opposite, a kneeling Carthusian monk and Saint Barbara. From this work, a number of other paintings have been identified as being by the same hand.

The Heritage Authority is best known as the custodian of the approximately 130 provincial heritage sites in the province,List of heritage sites in Northern Cape but is also responsible for administration of other forms of protection of heritage established under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act.  History  The Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority (sometimes referred to as 'Ngwao Boswa') is the successor body to the former National Monuments Council in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Under the 1996 Constitution of South Africa cultural matters are a competency shared between national and provincial government.Schedule 4, Part A, Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act. 108 of 1996 This necessitated the creation of a system whereby many of the responsibilities of the former National Monuments Council were devolved to provincial level via the National Heritage Resources Act. The Northern Cape Provincial Government elected initially to use provisions of the National Heritage Resources Act which allowed it to establish a provincial heritage resources authority (PHRA): 'Ngwao Boswa' was established by regulation on 28 February 2003.Official Notice 5 of 2003, Province of the Northern Cape Provincial Gazette No. 744, Kimberley: 28 February 2003 On 11 October 2003 the Council appointed by the MEC for Sport, Arts and Culture met for the first time and has since met regularly.Minutes of the First Meeting of the Council of Ngao Boswa Kapa Bokoni, 11 October 2003 The Council established a sub-committee known as the 'Permits Committee' which met monthly to consider applications under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act.Section 3.5, Ngwao- Boswa ya Kapa Bokone Annual Report 2009-2010, Kimberley, 2010, Page 4 The Council also established an Executive Committee.Section 3.2, Ngwao-Boswa ya Kapa Bokone Annual Report 2009-2010, Kimberley, 2010, Page 4 The Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority Act, 2013, reconstitutes the Council and provides for the governance of the authority, determining its objects, functions and operation, and regulating staff and financial matters.Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority Act, Act No 9 of 2013, Province of the Northern Cape Provincial Gazette Extraordinary, No 1784, 5 March 2014.

Location  Iriqui National Park occupies the space between the Draa River and the South foothills of the Anti-Atlas, in the provinces of Zagora and Tata.  Flora and fauna  The park is characterized by typical desert landscape of southern Morocco. The vegetation is represented by a wooded steppe and savanna with acacias. Some of its dunes are covered by tamarix. During wet periods, Lake Iriqui becomes a temporary wetland and a port of call and wintering site for many migratory water birds, including flamingos, coots and geese, which gives the park an important ecological character. The rehabilitation of the wetland was one of the main objectives, when the park was created. In the park there are houbara bustards, North African ostriches, barbary sheep, dorcas gazelles, oryxes and striped hyenas.Sylvie Jourjon: L‚ÄôOasis Sacr√©e d‚ÄôOum L√¢alag. 5 December 2012 (French). There is also a large number of reptiles such as lizard, wyches, monitor lizards, chameleons, geckos and different varieties of snakes.  Human population  Apart from a few families settled inside the park, the entire human population of the area are nomadic. The latter, mostly from M'hamid El Ghouzlane practice transhumance along the circuit Figuig - Tan-Tan. The Iriqui area is the main place for grazing because of its good grazing potential.  Tourism  The rich landscape and cultural heritage of the region gives the park an important ecotourism potential that will be a lever for local economic development. Its establishment is part of a strategy to boost tourism in southern Morocco, which might become ultimately an important lever for the promotion and development of the Saharan areas.

He most likely reigned for a short period over the Memphite region during the mid-17th century BC, some time between 1663 BC and 1649 BC. __FORCETOC__  Attestions  Pharaoh Seheqenre Sankhptahi is named and represented on the stele of royal sealer and overseer of sealers Nebsumenu dating to Year One of his reign. The origin of the stele is not known for certain‚Äîthe stele was acquired in 1999 by the National Archaeological Museum of Spain from a private collector. However, Kim Ryholt notes that it depicts Sankhptahi offering oil to the god Ptah \\"He who is south of his wall\\" (rsy-snb=f) and to Anubis \\"Lord of bandagers\\" (nb wtyw), both of which are epithets from the Memphite region. Ryholt concludes that Seheqenre Sankhptahi probably reigned over Memphis and thus belongs to the 13th dynasty, which had control over the region at the time. Furthermore, Ryholt suggests that Sankhptahi may himself have been born in Memphis, as indicated by his theophorous name based on Ptah, the god of the city. Stele of Nebsumenu representing Seheqenre Sankhptahi making offerings to Ptah and Anubis. According to the latest reading of the Turin canon by Ryholt, Seheqenre Sankhptahi is attested there, on column 8 line 25, which contains the damaged prenomen [?]·∏≥-n-RÀÅ. Ryholt remarks that Seheqenre is the only king of the period whose name matches these signs and reads [S.·∏•]·∏≥-n-RÀÅ, Seheqenre on the Turin canon. Ryholt finally points to a blue-green steatite cylinder seal of unknown provenance and bearing the golden horus name Sekhaenptah, S.·∏´ÀÅ-n-pt·∏•, He whom Ptah causes to appear, as maybe belonging to Seheqenre Sankhptahi. Percy Newberry simply dates the seal to \\"about the end of the Middle Kingdom\\" without further identification of its owner. The seal is probably lost: originally in the Timmins collection housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it is now reportedly missing from the museum.  Family  A stele of unknown provenance, although probably Memphite in origin, and dated on stylistic grounds to the Second Intermediate Period presents a list of members of a royal family and gives the king's son name as [?]-pt·∏•-i. If this prince is the future pharaoh Seheqenre Sankhptahi as Ryholt proposes, then pharaoh Se[...]kare is his father and Minemsaes and Sit[...] are his sisters.

Early years James Jackson was the son of Joseph Jackson (1735-1813), a merchant of Blackburn, Lancashire who retired to Ribbleton with a modest fortune to become a gentleman farmer. Joseph Jackson married four times. James was the son of his third wife, and was born in 1771. When he was 18 he became a clerk with Dilworth and Hargreaves, bankers and traders in Lancaster, Lancashire. He later became involved in monitoring the manufacture of furnaces and forges for ironmaking. The French Revolution began in 1789, to be followed by the Directory and then the empire of Napoleon, which lasted until 1814. For much of this period Great Britain was at war with France. In 1793, when aged about 22, Jackson married Elizabeth Eccles Stackhouse, of Giggleswick, Yorkshire. He then went into maritime trade. His sons Joseph (born 1794), William (1796) and James (1798) were born in Lancaster. John was born in 1797 in Preston, just south of Lancaster. The eldest daughter, Ann, was born in 1804 in Manchester, where James Jackson was established in 1800. Between March 1802 and November 1804 he was a partner of John Branch, an auctioneer. His fifth son, Charles, was born in Manchester in October 1805. In November 1806 he was in charge of a cotton mill in Preston, but by January 1807 he was in London. Around this time Jackson had an income of ¬£1,370, enough to stop trading for a while, although he retained an interest in three ships. In February 1810 he moved to Penzance in Cornwall. Around 1812 he moved to Birmingham and established a factory with two carburizing furnaces and ten furnaces to make steel. France It was not known how to produce molten steel in France, so the country was dependent on the United Kingdom. Steel was ten times more expensive in France than in the United Kingdom. Napoleon encouraged the production of steel in the French empire, at Li√®ge, but after his abdication Li√®ge was no longer part of France. After visiting Paris in June 1814 during the first restoration, Jackson landed at Calais on 25 October 1814. He was then 42 years old. According to a report by Louis de Gallois in 1815 he considered that while steel mills were already numerous in England, he would find little competition in France and could also benefit from low wages. He had a large family, and by his enterprise he could found a valuable business for them. The British government confiscated all of Jackson's property in England. Napoleon returned to France. The new regime was favorable to Jackson during the Hundred Days. Jean-Antoine Chaptal, Director of Commerce, supported him. James Jackson chose Saint-√âtienne, in the heart of the Loire coal basin, as the location for his forges. He profited from a population familiar with iron working, and from a ready market for his products. In August 1815 James Jackson set a steelworks near Saint-√âtienne at Trablaine. Trablaine is on the Ondaine, in the town of Le Chambon-Feugerolles. The Trablaine factory started running in 1816. It included carburizing furnaces and crucible furnaces for molten steel. The factory produced molten steel for the first time in France. In August 1818, James Jackson left Trablaine, following a dispute with his partner, which he continued until he filed for bankruptcy in 1821. He moved to Monthieux in 1819 with his sons William, John, James and Charles, and then in 1820 to Rochetaill√©e and to Soleil, now Saint-√âtienne. Jackson returned to England around 1823. He died at Lancaster, Lancashire on 27 April 1829. Legacy Jackson's sons, naturalized Frenchmen, established an important steelworks at Assailly in 1830, now in the municipality of Lorette, Loire, on the Gier river. They founded or purchased several companies that produced steel, and participated in companies that used steel as raw material. In 1838, William Jackson married Louise Peugeot and George Peugeot married Anna Jackson. After this double matrimonial union between the Jackson and Peugeot families they created the company \\"Peugeot a√Æn√© et Jackson fr√®res\\". They bought mills at Pont-de-Roide and built steel mills where they manufactured products such as saws and umbrella frames. Associated with Pierre-Fr√©d√©ric Dorian and his stepfather Jacob Holtzer, the Jackson brothers also produced scythes and sickles at Pont-Salomon. In 1859 the company took the name \\"Dorian, Holtzer, Jackson et Cie.\\" On 14 November 1854 Jackson Fr√®res and three other companies merged and combined to form the Compagnie des Hauts-fourneaux, forges et aci√©ries de la Marine et des chemins de fer.

Talleyrand ceded the title to his nephew Edmond on 2 December 1817. To prevent the breakup of the estates, Edmond ceded the Dino property to his second son Alexandre (husband of Valentine de Sainte- Aldegonde), while his elder son Louis was styled Duke of Valen√ßay and later inherited the Duchy of Sagan. Alexandre in turn ceded the property to his elder son Maurice. Alexandre and Maurice were styled Duke of Dino, but the transfer of the associated property within the family had no power to alter the order of succession according to the original patent.

The Kakawin tells the story of Arjuna when he was engaged in meditation and performing a severe practice of asceticism on Mount Meru. During his meditation he was tested by the Gods by sending two of the most beautiful apsaras ‚Äî Supraba and Tilottama ‚Äî to seduce him. Arjuna was not budging and firmly continued his meditation despite of the apsara's seduction. Then the god Indra descented to earth disguising as an old Brahmin. They discussed about religious matters and Arjuna succeeded to answer Indra's questions, then he revealed his true identity and went back to svargaloka. Suddenly, a wild boar came raging, then Arjuna shot it with an arrow. But at the same time, an old hunter appeared that claimed that he also shot the boar, Arjuna and the old hunter were quarrelling about who killed the boar.

This property is attributed to a feature of the model, namely the absence of real imperfections such as real wage rigidities. Conversely, if New Keynesian models are extended to account for these real imperfections, divine coincidence disappears and central banks again face a trade-off between inflation and output gap stabilization. The definition of divine coincidence is usually attributed to the seminal article by Olivier Blanchard and Jordi Gal√≠ in 2007.  Model  In a standard New Keynesian model consisting of a Calvo price and sticky wages on the supply side and both a Keynes‚ÄìRamsey rule and the Taylor rule on the demand side, the so-called New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) is the following: :\\\\pi_{t} = \\\\beta E_{t}[\\\\pi_{t+1}] + \\\\kappa (y_{t} - y_{t}^*) \\\\, where \\\\pi_{t} is current inflation, E_{t}[\\\\pi_{t+1}] is expected future inflation, y_{t} is actual output, y_{t}^* is natural output and (y_{t} - y_{t}^*) is the welfare- relevant output gap. This equation implies that the two goals of maintaining inflation stable and stabilizing the output gap do not conflict: if, for example, an increase in oil price affects natural output, then holding inflation constant will make actual output equal natural output. This implication, or property, is called \\"divine coincidence\\". The mechanism of how shocks affect the NKPC and how this results in divine coincidence was detailed by Greg Mankiw in 2005 for both aggregate demand shocks and productivity shocks:Cf. Thoma, M. (September 9, 2005). Mankiw on \\"Divine Coincidence\\" in Monetary Policy. Economist's View. Retrieved on August 18, 2013. Expansionary (contractionary) demand shocks increase (decrease) prices and output above (below) potential. Because the covariance of price level and output gap is positive, a monetary policy stabilizing the price level tends to stabilize the output gap as well, thus isolating output from aggregate demand shocks. Positive productivity shocks depress prices and increase both actual and potential output, inciting a central bank targeting inflation to engage in expansionary monetary policy, which thereby further increases output. These two effects balance in many standard macroeconomic models, i.e. if the price level remains on target, both actual and potential output will increase by the same amount in response to a positive productivity shock. Divine coincidence relies on the assumption specific to the New Keynesian model that the gap between the natural level of output and the efficient (first-best) level of output is constant and invariant to shocks. This further implies that stabilizing the output gap‚Äîthe gap between actual and natural output‚Äîis equivalent to stabilizing the welfare-relevant output gap‚Äîthe gap between actual and efficient output. If, however, non-trivial real imperfections are introduced into the model, the gap between natural and efficient output is not constant any more and is affected by shocks. Consequently, divine coincidence disappears, the output gap does not equal the welfare-relevant output gap any longer, and central banks are left with their trade-off between inflation and output stabilization. Recently, it was shown that the divine coincidence does not necessarily hold in the non-linear form of the standard New-Keynesian model. This property would only hold if the monetary authority is set to keep the inflation rate at exactly 0%, which is the rate about which the linear form above is obtained as a first-order approximation of the non-linear model. At any other desired target for the inflation rate, there is an endogenous trade-off, even under no extra real imperfections such as sticky wages, and the divine coincidence no longer holds.  Relevance  Many researchers, such as Blanchard, Gal√≠ or Mankiw appear skeptical with regard to the existence of divine coincidence in the real world. This skepticism is mostly directed to the severely restrictive assumptions required for divine coincidence to exist in the NKPC model, most prominently the absence of real wage rigidities.

Tushar Raheja (born 1984) is an Indian storyteller and mathematics researcher based in Delhi. His first book Anything for you, Ma'am, a comedy, was published in 2006 while he was an undergraduate student in Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. His first feature film The Bizarre Murder of Mr Tusker , a sci-fi, psychological noir, starring BAFTA nominee Victor Banerjee, is due for release in 2019. His writing has been compared to that of P. G. Wodehouse by The Hindu and The Times of India and his books have gone on to achieve massive success, consistently remaining on the national best-selling charts. Raheja chose not to climb on the bandwagon of formulaic books but instead devoted himself to mathematical research and the study of narration. Romi and Gang (published July 2013 by Pirates), previously titled Run Romi Run is only his second book in the market. The book about the unalloyed dreams of the young in the Indian hinterland revolves around cricket. It has been praised by The Hindu, Hindustan Times, The Daily Telegraph among other publications. Raheja is one of the few authors in India to combine widespread popularity with critical acclaim. In 2015, he obtained his PhD from IIT Delhi in the field of applied probability.  Personal life  Raheja was born and brought up at Faridabad. His parents are doctors, his father a graduate of Armed Forces Medical College, Pune (AFMC). Raheja did his schooling from Apeejay School and DPS Faridabad. He obtained his B.Tech in industrial engineering from IIT Delhi in 2006. Anything for you, Ma'am, his first novel was also published in the same year. He followed it up with research in applied mathematics and completed Masters of Science in Operations research in 2010. In 2015, Raheja was awarded a PhD by IIT Delhi in the field of applied probability. Kiran Seth of SPIC MACAY and Sandeep Juneja were his thesis advisors.  Books  = Anything for you, Ma'am = Anything for you, Ma'am shot to national fame after its review in The Hindu headlined Outsourcing Wodehouse. The Times of India compared the plot to a classic Jeeves Wooster saga. The main protagonist Tejas has a propensity to land himself into comical troubles like Wooster and has an array of Jeeveses around him in the form of his friends and family. The book was especially praised for 'cleverly localising the Wooster persona. So English aristocracy, the idle rich, the lad sent down from Oxford, the young man with great expectations and little ability, the chappie whose only survival tool is a smart gentleman's gentleman called Jeeves ‚Äì all this is turned into rich material for humour of a local kind.' There has been criticism of the book's ending which is compared to a Bollywood movie. = Romi and Gang = Romi and Gang, while it has been likened to Enid Blyton's stories for its innocence and the sense of nostalgia it evokes, and has been considered by Hindustan Times to be 'the equivalent of watching Lagaan', it is closer in spirit to Swami and Friends. It is the story of the boy ubiquitous in maidans all over the Indian hinterland who dreams of being the next Sachin Tendulkar Romi and Gang is unique for its subject. Not many novels have been written about cricket all over the world. It has been noted for the remarkable shift in the Raheja's writing style from his first book. Raheja does not intend to stick to any particular genre and is working on a science fiction book at the moment. Romi and Gang is also unique for the inclusion of 25 full page pen and ink illustrations by Biswajit Das which were included to lend the book an old-world charm.  Films  In 2017, Raheja moved on from writing books to directing films. The international rights of his first feature film, This will End in Murder, were acquired at Berlinale by an American sales agency. It will be released in India in 2018.

She fought mainly as an ocean escort during the Battle of the Atlantic. She was sunk in 1943. She was named for Louisburg, Nova Scotia. Background Flower-class corvettes like Louisburg serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Louisburg was ordered 23 January 1940 as part of the 1939‚Äì1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down by Morton Engineering and Dry Dock Co. at Quebec City and launched 27 May 1941. She was commissioned 2 October 1941 at Quebec City. During her brief career, Louisburg underwent two significant refits. The first took place at Halifax from the end of March 1942 until June of that year. The second took place on the Humber in the United Kingdom where she had extra AA fittings added in preparation for her escort duties related to Operation Torch. War service After arriving at Halifax for deployment on 15 October 1941, Louisburg was initially assigned to Sydney Force. She remained with them until mid-January 1942. At that time, she was transferred to the Newfoundland Escort Force. In February 1942 she took part in the battle for SC 67. During that battle, her sister ship, HMCS Spikenard was lost. After her refit, she returned to service, now as a mid- ocean escort on convoys between St. John's and Derry. In September 1942 Louisburg was sent to the United Kingdom as part of the Canadian contribution to Operation Torch. On 9 December 1942 she was rammed by HMS Bideford while anchored at Derry. She spent five weeks in repair yards at Belfast recovering from the damage. Upon her return to service, she was assigned to escort Torch- related convoys. =Sinking= While escorting a convoy, KMF 8, from Gibraltar to Bone, Algeria, the Louisburg was among those hit by bombs and torpedoes from two formations of enemy aircraft. The first formation was made up of seven Ju 88 bombers and the second seven He 111 armed with torpedoes operating out of Italy. 38 crew were lost when she sank near Oran.

The attraction officially opened to the public on March 29, 2014. History During the season of 2012, the Wildwasserbahn 2 was completely dismantled. Before that there were a few speculations about a new rollercoaster on the place of the Wildwasserbahn 2. In the 2013 season of the park, the coaster was announced in late summer, but before that, the themepark announced the new ride as follows: \\"It's big. It's fast. It comes. Closer and closer and closer. Premiere for Germany 2014. Here at Heide Park Resort.\\". On August 18, 2013, one day before Heide Park Resorts' 35th birthday, the park announced some details about the new ride to the media. The park also put up a website saying that the full details of the ride will be announced in the morning of August 19, 2013. On this website were construction updates and other stuff about Flug der D√§monen. The name of the new Wing Coaster was announced on January 8, 2014. It officially opened to the public on March 29, 2014. Ride experience Layout of Flug der D√§monen After being dispatched from the station, the train makes a right hand turn, entering the lift hill. Upon reaching the top of the lift hill, the train enters the first element of the roller coaster, a Dive Drop. This element is similar to the Dive Drop's found on X-Flight (Six Flags Great America) at Six Flags Great America, The Swarm at Thorpe Park, GateKeeper at Cedar Point and consists of the train rotating 180 degrees into an upside down position before descending back to the ground. During this drop, the train reaches its maximum speed of 62 miles per hour (100 km/h). Next, the train enters a camelback hill where riders experience the feeling of weightlessness. Upon exiting the hill, the train immediately enters an Immelmann loop. Next, the train goes through a Corkscrew, followed by a left-handed 270-degree downward helix. The next element is a new element called a Demonic Knot, it consists of a combination of an inclined Dive Loop followed by an inclined Immelmann Loop. The train then enters a 315-degree left hand turn leading into the final brake run. Characteristics =Track= Flug der D√§monen's tubular steel track is long and the lift is approximately . The track is white and the supports are dark green. Also, the entire track weighs a total of about . =Trains= Flug der D√§monen operates with two open-air steel and fiberglass trains, each with six cars of four seats each, with two on each side of the track. Each train holds 24 riders and the ride has a capacity of about 1,060 riders per hour. Riders are restrained by flexible over-the-shoulder restraints and interlocking seat belts and riders are required to be between and to ride. Because the seats are on the side of the track, a cantilevered steel arm is used to support the wings. The trains are painted black and white. The front of each train is shaped to resemble the head of a demon. It was designed by German graffiti artist Markus Genesius.

The island is situated off Cape Arena, near to Praia a Mare. The name of the island either derives from Italian ', a temple, or Greek ', a vortex or storm. Geography The island covers an area of and has a maximum altitude of . The north of the island is dominated by steep limestone cliffs over high. Water erosion has given rise to many caves, including Monaco, Sardine, Cascate and Leone. The largest cave is Grotta Azzura (the Blue Grotto), while Grotta Gargiulo is almost completely submerged and reaches to below sea level. History The island was frequented by Muslim vessels in the course of their military expeditions to Italy in the ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries. In the summer of 1600, the shoreline was stormed by the Turks, led by Amurat Rays. Citizens from Aieta on the island, led by Francesco Vitigno, resisted the attack until they were all captured and killed. In 1806 the island became the base of operations of the English fleet under Admiral Sidney Smith, who tried to oppose the penetration of Napoleon's army in Calabria. Joachim Murat eliminated feudalism on the island in 1812. The island was handed over from the Marquis of Aieta to the City of Aieta. Later the island passed to the Bourbons. On 25 December 1917, off the coast of the island, the submarine UB-49 commanded by Hans von Mellenthin of the Austro- Hungarian Navy sank the British steamer Umballa carrying barley. The ship, launched in 1898 and owned by the British India Steam Navigation Company Ltd, had sailed from Karachi, had stopped in Syracuse, and was heading for Naples. The ship's bell was donated to the church of the Madonna della Grotta and renamed Santa Maria della Vittoria. In 1928 the island became the autonomous property of the municipality of Praia a Mare. In 1956 the island was given a concession for 99 years and in 1962 was sold for 50 million lira to Gianni Agnelli with the aim of developing the island for elite international tourists. Development included the construction of a new road from the wharf inland, new housing and other facilities. On 13 June 2014, a court annulled the contract. Fauna and flora Dino Vegetation is Mediterranean, with some rare plants in the inaccessible cliffs to the north and northwest such as the Mediterranean dwarf palm (Chamaerops humilis), the rock carnation (Dianthus rupicola), and the endemic palinuro primula (Primula palinuri) found in colonies on limestone facing north and northeast. Dino has a larger population of the primula than the rest of the Tyrrhenian coast, probably because the areas of its flourishing on Dino are accessible with difficulty and therefore have been little disturbed by humans. On Dino, groups of primula are seen that have abandoned their normal cave habitats and have pushed between the herbaceous vegetation, even finding niches under oak trees. Individuals and small groups of the plant are also seen on the beach and clinging to the rock faces of cliffs on the mainland opposite the island. The primula palinuri is included in the IUCN list of endangered species. Due to the presence of primula, and other endemic species, the island was designated a Site of Community Interest (SCI) in 2011. A nature reserve is being established on the island. Dino fauna includes many species of migratory birds, gulls which nest on steep cliffs and some birds of prey. There are also small rodents and several species of reptiles. Much more varied is the underwater ecosystem. The rare Scyllarides latus can be found in Grotta Gargiulo and the seas around the island are home to Chromis chromis, moray, octopus and, between deep, among the Paramuricea clavata over in height, grouper and amberjack.

It is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Reno.  History  The former location on Prater Way in Sparks, Nevada was a brick Roman Catholic church that was built in 1932 to replace an earlier church that was built in 1905 but destroyed by a fire in 1930. It was designed by prolific Nevada architect Frederic J. DeLongchamps (1882-1969) in Mediterranean Revival architecture. It was used as a Catholic church as late as 2004 when construction on a larger building was completed and the parish moved to current location. When the older building on Prater Way, Sparks, Nevada was photographed in 2014, it was operating under the name \\"Iglesia Cristiana Monte Sinai\\".See photo The older church building on Prater Way was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The building was deemed significant as the oldest surviving Catholic church in Sparks, as one of the first built in Nevada after the state became a diocese under 1931 decree of Pope Pius XI, and architecturally as a relatively rare use of Mediterranean Revival style in Nevada and \\"one of the many outstanding works\\" of DeLongchamps. Its original form is \\"somewhat obscured\\" by a 1970 addition of a vestibule and porch on the front, added to provide handicapped access, but the addition was designed to be compatible architecturally. and The newer location had further construction in 2006 to build a Faith Foundation building in the east end of the parking lot.

Over the next twenty years he became one of their most regular and most popular reviewers, and his success in this line helped to promote his rise in politics. In 1843 he was persuaded to collect his reviews in book form, and the Critical and Historical Essays were duly published by Longman in three volumes. Macaulay restricted the collection to his contributions to the Edinburgh Review, and left out some of these also, especially those which he thought were of ephemeral interest or which personally attacked former political enemies.  Reception  Critical and Historical Essays was from the first a successful undertaking, reaching a seventh reprinting by 1849, and it was soon being read all over the English-speaking world. One 19th century traveller in Australia reported that the books he found there were for the most part copies of the Bible, Shakespeare, and Macaulay's Essays. At the end of the 19th century George Saintsbury gave the Essays high praise, though only as broad-brush sketches: > On any subject which Macaulay has touched, his survey is unsurpassable for > giving a first bird's-eye view, and for creating interest in the matter‚Ä¶You > need not ‚Äì you had much better not ‚Äì pin your faith on his details, but his > Pisgah sights are admirable. Saintsbury's contemporary the historian Frederic Harrison credited Macaulay's influence with ensuring that \\"the best journals and periodicals of our day are written in a style so clear, so direct, so resonant.\\" More recently the scholar Angus Ross judged that the popularity of the Essays was founded on Macaulay's \\"firm and unqualified belief in his own strong opinions; a large stock of miscellaneous information; a brilliant and slashing style; and considerable insensitivity.\\" Another contemporary critic speaks for many when he sets off Macaulay's \\"rapid, sparkling, transparent, utterly lucid\\" style against the prejudice and inaccuracy he brought to his advocacy of the Whig view of history.

Biography According to Mathias Balen in his 1677 Description of the city of Dordrecht, she was a survivor of the St. Elizabeth's flood (1421). Her wicker cradle was found floating on the water, and besides the baby, it contained a cat. The small cradle with baby and cat are included as one of the details of the 1490 panorama of the flood by the Master of the St Elizabeth Panels, on view at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The subject was romantic enough to be expanded over time. The baby was given the name Beatrix de Rijke, who married Jacob Roerom. She was also called Beatrix de Gelukkige (Beatrix the lucky one). The flood itself, first recording the loss of 18 villages, by 1677 had grown to encompass 72 villages.

The theory supporting such an action is that multinational companies headquartered in one country, but which earn income in a second country will be unlikely to bring income from the second country back to their home country if high taxes will be assessed on this income when it is brought back. By allowing those companies to bring income back to the home country at a reduced tax rate, money will be injected into the economy of the home country that otherwise would remain in the second country. In 2004, the United States Congress enacted such a tax holiday for U.S. multinational companies in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA)) section 965, allowing them to repatriate foreign profits to the United States at a 5.25% tax rate, rather than the existing 35% corporate tax rate.Martin A. Sullivan, Corporate Tax Reform: Taxing Profits in the 21st Century, p. 83, . Under this law, corporations brought $362 billion into the American economy, primarily for the purposes of paying dividends to investors, repurchasing shares, and purchasing other corporations. The largest multi-national companies, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., and Oracle Corp., recalled only 9% of their cash possessions following the 2004 act. In 2011, Senate Democrats, arguing against another repatriation tax holiday, issued a report asserting that the previous effort had actually cost the United States Treasury $3.3 billion, and that companies receiving the tax breaks had thereafter cut over 20,000 jobs.Kristina Peterson, \\"Report: Repatriation Tax Holiday a 'Failed' Policy\\", Wall Street Journal (October 10, 2011).

A temperamental filly who was often difficult to ride, she was a specialist miler who won seven Group races. After winning her only race as a two-year-old, she won the Nell Gwyn Stakes in April 1986, but was beaten into third place when favourite for the 1000 Guineas. She then won her next five races: the Irish 1,000 Guineas, Coronation Stakes, Child Stakes, Sussex Stakes and Prix du Moulin and was rated the best filly of her generation in Europe. She stayed in training as a four-year-old in 1987 and won a second Child Stakes. She was twice the beaten favourite in the Breeders' Cup Mile. Retired to stud at the end of 1987, she had some success as a broodmare. Background Sonic Lady was a bay mare with a small white star. bred in Kentucky by J. Allan McTier. She was sired by the disqualified 2000 Guineas winner Nureyev out of the Child Stakes winner Stumped. Apart from Sonic Lady, Nureyev was the sire of the winners of at least forty-five Group One/Grade I including Peintre Celebre, Spinning World, Zilzal, Stravinsky and Miesque. His career as a stallion has been described as \\"outstanding\\". Sonic Lady was not, technically a Thoroughbred as her female ancestry could not be traced to one of the foundation mares of the breed. She was a product of the half-bred Verdict family, whose ancestry could be traced no further back than an unnamed Perion mare foaled in 1837. So many non-thoroughbreds from this family won major races that the descendants of the Perion mare were admitted to the General Stud Book in 1969 as Half-Bred Family 3. Members of this family include Quashed, Attraction and Sonic Lady's great-grandmother Lucasland, the winner of the July Cup in 1966 As a yearling, Sonic Lady was consigned to the Fasig-Tipton Sales, where she was bought for $500,000 by Sheikh Mohammed. The filly was sent to England where she was trained by Michael Stoute at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1985: two-year-old season= Before Sonic Lady appeared on the racecourse she had acquired a reputation as the best filly in Stoute's stable and had been supported in the betting for the 1000 Guineas. She made her debut in the Blue Seal Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot Racecourse in September. Sonic Lady accelerated clear of her eight opponents in the final quarter mile and won by seven lengths from Warm Welcome despite drifting to the right in the closing stages. Despite never having contested a Group race she ended the year as the 3/1 favourite for the 1000 Guineas. =1986: three-year-old season= Spring Sonic Lady made her three-year-old debut in the Group Three Nell Gwyn Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 15 April. She was traveling easily throughout the race and pulled clear of the field in the closing stages to win by three lengths from Lady Sophie, with the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Embla in fourth place. Her reappearance was the front-page story on the first edition of the newly founded Racing Post: the rival Sporting Life's front page had featured Embla. On 1 May Sonic Lady started the 6/4 favourite for the 173rd running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. Swinburn opted to ride Sonic Lady in preference to her stable companion Maysoon who had won the Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury. She became unsettled in the preliminaries and arrived at the start in an agitated state. She took the lead approaching the final quarter mile but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third, beaten three quarters of a length and a head by Midway Lady and Maysoon. For Sonic Lady's next race, the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh on 24 May she was equipped with a new bridle incorporating a rubber noseband, which was designed to help her settle. Her participation in the race was in doubt as she arrived without her equine passport but she was allowed to run after a copy was faxed from Newmarket. She started 4/1 joint favourite with the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Baiser Vole and won easily by two lengths. Summer At Royal Ascot in June Sonic Lady started the 8/15 favourite for the Coronation Stakes (then a Group Two race) and won impressively by two length from Embla and Someone Special. She then added a victory in the Child Stakes (now the Group One Falmouth Stakes) at Newmarket on 9 July, beating Dusty Dollar by one and a half lengths. Three weeks later at Goodwood Racecourse, Sonic Lady was matched against colts and older horses for the first time in the Group One Sussex Stakes. The filly started the 5/6 favourite ahead of the Queen Anne Stakes winner Pennine Walk and the Kentucky Derby runner-up Bold Arrangement. Swinburn restrained Sonic Lady at the back of the five runner field before making a forward move in the straight. She quickly took the lead and went clear before being eased down to win by one and a half lengths from her stable companion Scottish Reel. Autumn In September, Sonic Lady was sent to France to contest the Prix du Moulin over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. She started the 8/5 favourite with her main opposition expected to come from the German colt Lirung, who had won the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville Racecourse in August. Sonic Lady refused to settle for Swinburn and pulled hard from the start. She was still fighting her jockey's attempts to restrain her when she turned into the straight on the wide outside. Sonic Lady moved easily into the lead 400 metres from the finish but had to be ridden out by Swinburn to win by a head from the French colt Thrill Show, with Lirung three lengths back in third place. After an eight- week break, Sonic Lady was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Mile at Santa Anita Park. Starting the 2.3/1 favourite she tracked the leaders before briefly taking the lead in the straight. She was soon overtaken and faded in the closing stages to finish seventh, three and a half lengths behind the winner Last Tycoon. =1987: four-year-old season= Sonic Lady remained in training as a four-year-old with the Breeders' Cup as her main objective. Her training in the early part of the year was disrupted by a foot injury and she appeared to be less than fully fit when she made her seasonal debut in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot where she finished third, beaten a length and a head by the colts Then Again and Water Cay. Three weeks later she was matched against the leading three-year-old filly Forest Flower in the Child Stakes at Newmarket. The early pace was very slow and Swinburn opted to send the filly into the lead after two furlongs. In the closing stages she held off the sustained challenge of the Aga Khan's filly Shaikiya to win by a head with Forest Flower ten and a half lengths back in fourth. Sonic Lady did not race again until 26 September, when she finished third behind Milligram and Miesque in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. In November, the filly was sent to California for her second attempt at the Breeders Cup Mile, with the Panamanian jockey Laffit Pincay replacing Swinburn. Racing on medication, including Lasix and Bute, she started the 2.9/1 favourite, but had no answer to the finishing speed of Miesque and finished third of the fourteen runners. Assessment In 1985, the Independent Timeform organisation gave Sonic Lady a rating of 109p, the \\"p\\" indicating that she was likely to improve. In the following year she was given a Timeform rating of 129, placing her alongside the Prix Vermeille winner Darara as the highest-rated three-year-old filly of the season. In the official International Classification she was given a rating of 127, a pound ahead of Darara and the Prix de Diane winner Lacovia, making her the top-rated European three-year-old filly. In the 1987 International Classification, Sonic Lady was rated on 123 level with Asteroid Field as the best older female racehorse in Europe in the 7 furlongs plus division: Timeform gave her a rating of 125. Stud record Sonic Lady was retired from racing to become a broodmare for her owner's Darley Stud. She produced two Group race winners, both sired by Blushing Groom: *Hazaam, bay colt, foaled 1989, won eight races including the Supreme Stakes *Sharman, bay colt, 1990, won Prix de La Jonchere Through her daughter Soninke, who was exported to Japan, she was also the great-grand-dam of Logi Universe and the Shuka Sho winner Deirdre. Sonic Lady died after a paddock accident in February 1996.

He became an architect and building contractor involved in significant buildings in Perth, Fremantle and York. He never gave up his Fenian beliefs and died before he could return to Ireland. Life Nunan was born in Rathcormac, a small town in north County Cork where he learnt the building trade from his father Denis Noonan. Joseph and his brother Frank established a building company that was able to successfully contract for the construction of buildings locally and in County Kerry. Nunan became a member of the Fenian Brotherhood in 1864. This was an Irish patriot organisation who were trying to establish Ireland as a country that was not under the rule of Great Britain. Nunan was named as a suspect when Constable William Duggan, who was carrying messages, was shot near Glenbeigh in February 1867. Nunan fled to England, but he was identified and arrested in London by an Irish policeman. He escaped on the return railway trip to Dublin by jumping through the window of a train reputedly travelling at 40 or 50 miles per hour leaving behind his two escorts. Nunan was again apprehended near Atherstone and taken back to Ireland. The Wild Goose - Nunan wrote about his escapes for this newspaper. Perth Gazette and West Australian Times, 17 January 1868, announcing the arrival of the Hougoumont in Fremantle At his trial in Tralee there were pleas of mercy for him, in particular, and Nunan was sent to Australia for seven years on 8 August 1867.Fenian Trials, Irish Times, 13 August 1867 During the voyage Nunan wrote humorously for the ship's newspaper (The Wild Goose) about his escape from the train and he also organised social events for his fellow convicts. The newspaper was issued and read aloud weekly on board. There were over 250 convicts aboard the Hougoumont; more than sixty of these were fellow Irish nationalists. Most of these were there as a result of the March 1867 abortive Fenian Rising. Nunan was taken to the convict establishment in Fremantle where he had to remain until 1869. In May the British Government under William Gladstone decided on a more conciliatory approach to Irish politics and Nunan was amongst those who were pardoned. Nunan could have returned to County Kerry but he elected to remain in Western Australia. He undertook to superintend construction of the new convent building in Victoria Square for the Sisters of Mercy,Highlights of Mercy Heritage at Victoria Square, Sisters of Mercy in WA, 1996, brochure; Letters between Bishop Griver and the Comptroller General's Office, 30 March and 6 April 1868. which had been designed by Richard Roach Jewell.Perth Gazette 18 November 1870 page 3. Nunan was already known as an expert in design and he had been approached by Father Patrick Gibney who was the new resident priest in York to build a new larger church for his growing congregation.\\"St. Patrick's Hall, York, Western Australia,\\" Medievalism in Australian Cultural Memory, accessed August 19, 2013, http://ausmed.arts.uwa.edu.au/items/show/634. Architect Hugh Francis Brophy photographed in Mountjoy Prison in 1866.NYPL library, accessed 18 August 2013 Nunan established another general contracting company with another builder from Dublin who was also a pardoned, Fenian, ex-convict. The two of them were able to employ ex-convicts to contract for many building contracts. They were particularly successful in winning contracts from the Catholic Church. In 1870 the construction of a police station was completed at Greenough Flats.Greenough, Australian Heritage Directory, accessed 18 August 2013 This was one of Nunan's buildings, but the design has also been credited to Richard Roach Jewell.Ray Oldham, 'Jewell, Richard Roach (1810‚Äì1891)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jewell-richard- roach-3858/text6137, accessed 19 August 2013. On 21 June 1871 Nunan married Anne Marie Farelly at St Mary's Cathedral in Perth. The following year his partner Hugh Brophy moved to Melbourne, but Nunan continued to take on work. Before he died in 1885 of tuberculosis he had built or designed the Greenough Police station, the Edwards building for the Christian Brothers School in 1882‚Äì83, St Patrick's Boys School in Perth and what has been called Nunan's best work, St Patrick's Church in York. He also built a store and house for Walter Padbury near his flour mill in Guildford. He is also said to have been involved with the building of Jewell's Perth Town Hall. Nunan died in Perth wanting to leave and return to his native Ireland where his affections still lay.Robyn Taylor, 'Nunan, Joseph Denis (1842‚Äì1885)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/nunan-joseph-denis-13136/text23773, accessed 19 August 2013. Nunan continued to be a Fenian as he and Brophy had served as treasurers for funds gathered from Irish sympathisers in Australia. The five hundred pounds was mainly in Nunan's control and was intended to help Fenians after they were pardoned or had finished their sentences in Australia. There was disagreement that accused Nunan of failing to deliver funds promptly and fairly and that this had led to hardship.

Dowell, whilst having the 4th highest score at the Pacific Rim Championships, did not officially earn the 4th place spot due to the two per country rule. Officially, Shallon Olsen of Canada earned that spot, however it will be noted by the selection committee for the 2016 U.S Olympic team that she did indeed earn the fourth highest score behind U.S teammates, Aly Raisman, Simone Biles and Laurie Hernandez. Dowell also qualified in second place to the Uneven Bars final, after displaying an impressive set on night 1 of competition. Also, after Simone Biles, was withdrawn from event finals, Dowell also earned a spot in the Floor Exercise final. In event finals, unfortunately, Dowell fell on a release move in the Uneven Bars final, incurring a deduction and placing her 5th with a score of 14.000. However, she came back strong and earned a silver medal in Floor Exercise finals with a score of 14.825 behind reigning Olympic Floor Exercise champion and U.S teammate, Aly Raisman. At the 2016 P&G; championships, Dowell was named to the National Team and earned a berth to the 2016 Olympic Trials in San Jose, CA. Despite solid efforts, she didn't make the main or alternate teams = 2017 = In 2017, Dowell continued her gymnastics career at the University of Oklahoma for her Sophomore season.

The Huskies, are lead twenty-ninth year head coach Geno Auriemma, play their home games at three different venues‚Äîthe XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut, on campus at the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut and a game at the Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport, Connecticut. This is UConn's first season as a member of the American Athletic Conference, known as The American. The Huskies finished the season with a perfect 40‚Äì0, 18‚Äì0 in the American League on both winning the regular season and the tournament title. They were automatic bid to the 2014 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament and won their ninth National Championship by defeating Notre Dame. The previous day, Connecticut also won the men's tournament. It was just the second time in NCAA history the same school had won both the men's and women's tournament; UConn first accomplished that feat in 2004. Off-season =USA Basketball= Connecticut basketball players were active in USA basketball events during 2013. Two UConn players were selected for the World University Games Team: * Bria Hartley * Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis The USA team was undefeated at the event in Kazan, Russia in July. Both UConn players started all six games. Hartley was the leading scorer for the USA team with 13.5 points per game, while Mosqueda-Lewis was a close second with 13.0 points per game. Mosqueda-Lewis was the leading rebounder for the team with 41 for an average of almost seven per game. In the gold medal game against the host, Russia, Hartley was the leading scorer with 17 points on 6 for 7 shooting from the field. Mosqueda-Lewis scored 15 points. Three UConn players were selected to be on the USA U19 (Under 19) team: * Moriah Jefferson * Breanna Stewart * Morgan Tuck Tuck was selected to be the team captain. The team traveled to the Canary Islands to take part in a preliminary event, the Lanzarote International Invitational Title, which included other teams also headed to the U19 world championship. In the opening game against Australia, the Aussies held a lead at halftime, which was extended to seven points in the second half, until Morgan Tuck helped lead a comeback, resulting in a close win. The team then defeated the host team, Spain, to win the Lanzarote International Invitational title. Following the preliminary event, the team traveled to Klaipƒóda and Panevƒó≈æys, Lithuania for the World Championship. All three UConn players were starters in every game, except one game missed by Jefferson due to injury. The USA team won their first five games easily, then had a close, six point victory over France. In the medal rounds, the USA team beat Japan easily in the quarterfinals, then faced Australia, the team that had played them close in the Canary islands. The game started out quite close, with Australia leading on some occasions, and held a three-point lead with six minutes to go in the first half. Then Stewart scored nine consecutive points to start a 21‚Äì0 run to take over the game. The USA team won, to advance to the gold medal game against France, the team they had played earlier in a close game. The first half was close, with the USA holding a seven-point lead at halftime, but the second half was all USA, who held France to only eight more points. The USA won the gold medal by a score of 61‚Äì28. Stewart set a U19 scoring record with 152 points, surpassing the record previously held by Maya Moore. Stewart was also honored as the MVP of the tournament. =Roster changes= Three seniors departed from the prior team: * Kelly Faris * Caroline Doty * Heather Buck Faris was selected 11th overall in the 2013 WNBA Draft by the Connecticut Sun.\\"Griner, Delle Donne, Diggins go 1‚Äì2‚Äì3\\". espn.go.com. April 16, 2013. Retrieved 26 Aug 2013. The team added a single freshman: * Saniya Chong Chong is a 5' 9\\" guard who averaged over 30 points per game with two games over 55 points. She also had almost ten assists and five steals per game as a junior at Ossining High School in New York. In her senior season, she scored 928 points, setting a single season record for scoring in the state of New York. She helped lead her high school team to the state championship in 2013, the first ever in the history of the high school. In a regular season game, Ossining faced Hamilton, who were 12‚Äì0 at the time. Hamilton led late in the game, but Chong scored 24 points in the fourth quarter to lead her team to an 88‚Äì79 victory. That performance earned her a spot as the Sports Illustrated national Player of the Week. Chong was recognized by Parade Magazine as their national Girls Basketball Player of the Year. She was also honored by the National High School Coaches Association as the girls basketball National Player of the Year. UConn added two walk-ons to the roster. Briana Pulido is a sophomore from Florida who was on the track and field team, but will drop that sport to concentrate on basketball. She will join the team as a 5' 7\\" guard. Tierney Lawlor is a freshman from Ansonia High school, who will also play as a guard. Lawlor was captain of her high school team as a junior and senior. Game results =Pre-season= Connecticut opened the season against NCAA Division II Gannon University. The Gannon Golden Knights were ranked second in the nation in the Division II pre-season poll. The Huskies had little difficulty, led by Stewart's 21 points, to help win the game 101‚Äì35. The second exhibition game was against Division II Philadelphia University. The Lady Rams were over-matched, and UConn won the game 93‚Äì28. Philadelphia held an early lead at 3‚Äì2, but did not score again for eleven minutes. Every UConn player had double-digit minutes. =Regular season= 2013 Connecticut opened the regular season against the Hartford Hawks. The Hawks are coached by Jennifer Rizzotti who played for UConn under Auriemma. This game marked the 39th game between an Auriemma coached team and a team whose coach or assistant coach had previously played for him or served as an assistant coach. The teams coached by Auriemma have won all 39 games. This game was no exception, with UConn prevailing 89‚Äì34. The game between UConn and Stanford matched up the #1 and #3 ranked teams in the nation. The game result, though was over-shadowed by an injury to Mosqueda- Lewis, who fell hard to the floor, landing on her right arm, and filled the arena with her cries. She left the game. A report a few days later indicated she would be out three to five weeks. Stokes player more minutes than she might have otherwise, and ended with a double-double (ten points and twelve rebounds). The game was played at Gampel Pavilion, the first match-up between UConn and Stanford at the on-campus location since 1993. UConn won the game, 75‚Äì57. UConn traveled to Maryland below full strength. In addition the Mosqueda-Lewis, who was injured in the prior game and out indefinitely, Tuck underwent knee surgery which was expected to keep her out for four to six weeks. Early ant he game, the score was tied at seven apiece, with UConn's Stewart scoring seven and Maryland's Alyssa Thomas scoring seven. UConn held a five-point lead at intermission, which Maryland quickly countered in the beginning of the second half, tying the game at 43 points each. However, UConn then scored the next eight points. Thomas scored to stop the run and Dolson picked up a fourth foul but UConn went on a 9‚Äì2 run to take a commanding lead. Thomas scored 20 points for Maryland, but Stewart had 26, which helped UConn win 72‚Äì55, in front of 15,327 fans in the arena. Hartley entered the game against Penn State in a shooting slump from beyond the three-point line, having missed eleven consecutive attempts in her prior game. She did not shake it off in the beginning of the Penn State game, missing two shots having making one. She went over to teammate Mosqueda-Lewis, sitting on the bench with an injury, but a player who led the nation in three points shooting the prior year. She decided to rub hands with Mosqueda-Lewis for luck, and promptly hit her next three consecutive three-point attempts. Penn State hung with UConn early, but UConn broke a ten-all tie starting with a three-pointer by Chong which began a twelve-point run by the Huskies. Although Penn State would cut a 23-point lead down to nine points at one time, helped by 18 points from Penn State's Maggie Lucas, Hartley responded with eight consecutive points of her own to rebuild the lead. UConn won their third consecutive game over a ranked opponent by a score of 71‚Äì52. UConn's next game was against Oregon, a team averaging just under 110 points per game. Oregon is coached by Paul Westhead, who has coached NBA, WNBA and NCAA men's teams. A team would score over 110 points, but it was the Huskies, who won 114‚Äì68. Late in the game, the UConn staff realized that Stefanie Dolson was close to a triple- double, so she returned to the floor, and earned an assist to complete the accomplishment. She ended the game with 26 points, 14 rebounds, and 11 assists, only the second UConn Husky to complete the feat in UConn women's basketball history. Laura Lishness had the prior triple-double in 1989 against Providence college, with 14 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists. UConn served as a host school for the inaugural Basketball Hall of Fame Women's Challenge. The event included eight teams, four of whom played November 22‚Äì24 at UConn locations, and four of whom played the same dates at Ohio State University. All eight teams then played on December 1 at the MassMutual Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, located near the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. UConn opened the event against BU, held at Gampel Pavilion. The game started out ragged, with BU leading for almost the first four minutes, and UConn not breaking into double digits until after six minutes had been played. Then UConn went on a 21‚Äì0 run against the Terriers to open up a large lead. Dolson had 23 points, which, coupled with her 20-point production in the prior game represented the first time she has scored 20 or more in back-to-back games.UConn went on to win 96‚Äì38. UConn faced Monmouth University in the second game, also held at Gampel Pavilion. The score was tied at seven points each early, but UConn then went on a 34‚Äì6 run, which included a stretch of 21 consecutive points scored by the Huskies, to put the game out of reach. UConn went on to win 100‚Äì46. UConn played for the third time in three days and the fourth times in five days against St. Bonadventure, to end the first phase of the Hall of Fame Classic. This game was played at the XL Center in Hartford. Kiah Stokes led the term in scoring for the first time in her career, putting up a career-high 19 points, along with eight rebounds and four blocked shots. She helped the Huskies win the game 88‚Äì39. After a week off, UConn played Ohio State in the final game of the Hall of Fame Classic. All eight teams in the Classic participated in a dinner, held at the Hall of Fame the day before all teams participated in the final game of the event on Sunday December 1. The team shows signs of the layoff, committing 16 turnovers, including eight be Dolson. Hartley led the team with 17 points, helping the team to a 70‚Äì49 win. The win represented the 53rd consecutive victory in an in-season tournament for the Huskies. UConn started the season with a relatively small lineup of seven scholarship players, supplemented by two walk-ons. Injuries to Mosqueda-Lewis and Tuck reduced that lineup even further, and as the team prepared for the University of California-Davis, Stokes turned an ankle and was unavailable for practice and the game. While the limited roster forced adjustments to practice routines, it seemed to have little effect on the availability of the team to play effectively. UConn won the game by sixty points 97‚Äì37. Hartley led the team in points with 25, while freshman Chong added ten points and Jefferson recorded a season high eight assists. After a twelve-day layoff for exams, UConn's next game was against Duke, ranked number 2 in the nation. This game would be the first game for Mosqueda-Lewis since her injury in the Stanford game. She wore a protective sleeve, and the coaching staff had no idea how she would fare, even to the point of preparing a game plan in case she was ineffective, but her return was solid. She hit seven three-pointers, a career high, helping the Huskies defeat Duke 83‚Äì61. Teammate Stewart contributed 24 points as the Huskies extended their record to 11‚Äì0. UConn then traveled to Madison Square Garden to participate in the Maggie Dixon classic, and annual event honoring the Army coach. Stewart had 29 points, matching a career high, along with ten rebounds to help the Huskies to a win over number 20 ranked California. Stewart scored more points in the first half than the entire Bears team. The last game of the calendar year, December 29, against Cincinnati, featured a ceremony to honor the national championship team of 2003 and 2003. Several members of those teams were in attendance for the game and the ceremony. UConn scored the first 16 points of the game but then the Bearcats outscored the Huskies 20‚Äì17 over the rest of the half. The Huskies regained their footing in the second half, ending with a 67‚Äì34 victory. 2014 The Huskies opened the new year in Florida, at the University of Central Florida, on New Year's Day. The Knights held a lead to the first media timeout, but the Huskies then opened up a lead they would never relinquish. USF's Briahanna Jackson scored 28 points to lead all scorers, but UConn as a team outscored the Knights to win 77‚Äì49. UConn started slow against Memphis three days later, holding only a three-point margin six minutes into the game. The Huskies then outscored the Tigers by 30 points over the rest of the first half. UConn won easily, 90‚Äì49. UConn's next game was at home against Houston, the last place team in the AAC, whose head coach left the team before Christmas. Houston has not won since, and would not this day, as the Huskies win 90‚Äì40 behind 24 points from Stewart and 19 from Tuck. UConn then played at Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport. Although the Huskies had played in the arena in post-season NCAA games, this was the first ever regular season in the arena. The attendance was 9,274, a sellout, which tied a record attendance for the location. Temple, coach by former UConn assistant coach Tonya Cardoza, took an early lead but could not sustain it. Four UConn players had double-digit points, helping to secure a victory, 80‚Äì36. The following game was against seventh ranked Baylor on Baylor's home court, where the Bears had a 69-game home winning streak. The streak began March 7, 2010, which meant no player on the current Bears team had ever lost a game at home. After five minutes, the score was even at ten points apiece.UConn scored the next seven to open up a small lead. The Huskies maintained the lead into the second half. Nine minutes into the second half, the Bears cut the lead to 50‚Äì49, but that would be as close as they would get. The Huskies went on to win 66‚Äì55, ending the Baylor home win streak. With Rutgers moving to the Big Ten Conference next season, the UConn game at the RAC is the last scheduled league game at that arena. UConn scored first, and never gave up the lead, as Hartley scored 30 points, representing a career high. The Huskies won 94‚Äì64. Mosqueda-Lewis failed to hit a three in the game against Rutgers, only the seventh time in her career without a three in a game, but responded with five three-pointers in the following game against Memphis. Jefferson had nine steals, only one off the school record held jointly by Cathy Bochain (1980) and Jennifer Rizzotti (1996). The Huskies won 83‚Äì49 to improve to 20‚Äì0. UConn started the season with nine scholarship players plus two walk-ons, but has had to play with fewer on several occasions. In the game against USF, Tuck was unavailable (out for the season), Banks was unavailable (ankle injury) and Chong dressed, but had stomach issues and was unable to play. This left the five starters and one scholarship player. Opposing coaches aren't showing much sympathy, as the short bench hasn't contributed to a loss. Against USF, Stewart scored 29 to help lead the Huskies to an 81‚Äì53 win. The game against Temple on January 28 was held at McGonigle Hall an arena familiar to head coach Auriemma, as it is just six miles from where he grew up, but it was the first time he had ever coached a game there. Stewart hit 15 of 19 shot attempts, ending with a career-high 37 points. She helped lead the Huskies to a 93‚Äì56 victory. When UConn played Cincinnati in December, the Bearcats held UConn to 67 points, their lowest scoring total of the year to that point. (South Florida would hold UConn to 63 in February.) In their second match up of the season, defense would again be the key theme, but not by Cincinnati. The Huskies scored 86, while holding the Bearcats to just 29 points. UConn won easily, extending their season record to 23‚Äì0. On February 4, UConn faced SMU at their campus home, Gampel. The Huskies scored the first 19 points of the game; all five starters ended with double- digit scoring. The final score in favor of UConn was 102‚Äì41. UConn next faced Louisville, in a rematch of the 2013 National Championship game. Louisville was ranked #4 in the country, and came in with only a single loss on the season, winners of their last 16 games, the longest winning streak in school history. The game was reasonably close early, with UConn holding only a five- point lead late in the first half. Then Stewart hit consecutive three-pointers to open up the lead before the sellout crowd. The Huskies held Louisville's leading scorer Shoni Schimmel, to nine points and won 81‚Äì64. UConn returned to Florida to play South Florida. Despite the final score of 63‚Äì38, USF head coach Jose Fernandez had reasons for optimism. His team held UConn to the lowest points total of the season, as well as the fewest made field goals. Mosqueda-Lewis was unable to play due to mononucleosis, so Saniya Chong was a first time starter. While she did not score, she played 37 minutes and earned praise from her coach. AAC Tournament Breanna Stewart wins AAC Tournament Most Outstanding Player award UConn had a bye for the first session of the tournament and played their first game on Saturday, March 7 against Cincinnati, the number 8 seed and winner of the 8/9 match-up with Central Florida. The Huskies never trailed, but the Bearcats stayed close early in the game, only four points behind at 17‚Äì13. However, UConn then extended the lead to 20 points by halftime, and won the game by 30 with a score of 72‚Äì42. In the semi-final match-up with Rutgers, UConn opened the scoring early, scoring 13 points before the Scarlet Knights got on the board. Despite leading 30‚Äì9 midway through the first half, the Huskies were not relaxing. Rutgers Betnijah Laney stole the ball near mid-court and headed to her basket for a layup. Stewart started near the paint, but sprinted at top speed and managed a crowd- pleasing block. She then went to the other end of the court and drained a three-pointer to extend the lead. UConn went to win, 83‚Äì57. The finals of the first ever AAC Tournament featured the top two seeds in the tournament, UConn and Louisville. UConn scored the first eight points of the game, and extended the lead to 27‚Äì10. The Cardinals came back with a run of their own, scoring ten of the next eleven points but UConn came back with a 12‚Äì2 run and held a 40‚Äì22 lead at halftime. UConn won 72‚Äì52 to win the conference tournament championship. Hartley, Mosqueda-Lewis and Dolson were named to the All- tournament team, while Stewart was named the Tournament Most Outstanding Player. NCAA Tournament UConn women's basketball team posing with Lincoln Regional trophy With the overall top seed in the NCAA Tournament, UConn drew the weakest of the qualifying teams, Prairie View A&M; University, who started the year losing their first eleven games, and ended the regular season with a losing record. However, they prevailed in their conference tournament, so were eligible for the NCAA tournament. The Huskies scored the first fifteen points of the game, and were never tested. UConn held a 44‚Äì12 lead at the half and coasted to an 83‚Äì43 final result. UConn faced St. Joseph's in the second round. The first two rounds were hosted by UConn, so this game presented the final game in Gampel Arena for the seniors on the team. As has been the sequence in recent games, UConn opened the scoring with a run, scoring the first eight points of the game before the Hawks scored. The Huskies won 91‚Äì52, with Mosqueda-Lewis scoring 20 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, to record only the third triple-double in UConn history. The Huskies played their third-round game in Lincoln, Nebraska against Brigham Young. In 1,440 minutes of play prior to this game, the UConn team had trailed for under 39 minutes in total, with zero seconds occurring in five post-season games. UConn trailed for several minutes in the first half, and although taking a one-point lead at halftime, gave up the lead and trailed in the second half for the first time this season. Hartley hit a three almost three minutes into the second half to give UConn a lead, then after BYU's Morgan Bailey tied the game, Stewart scored to give UConn a lead they would not relinquish. UConn gradually extended the lead, and won 70‚Äì51. The second game in the Lincoln Regional was against Texas A&M.; UConn scored the first basket, but the Aggies responded with eleven of the next thirteen points to take an 11‚Äì4 lead, the largest deficit UConn had faced this season. 81 seconds later, UConn tied the game on a three by Mosqueda-Lewis. Texas A&M; would tie the game at 13 and 15 points each, but would never take another lead. The Aggies cut an eleven-point halftime lead to three points in the second half, but would get no closer. The final score, in favor of UConn, was 69‚Äì54. Mosqueda-Lewis earned the regional Most Outstanding Player award. Dolson made her 150th start, which tied an NCAA record. UConn team with championship trophy 2014, on the floor in Nashville, shortly after winning the game and receiving the Championship trophy. Connecticut faced Stanford in the semi-final game. The Huskies scored twice before the Cardinal scored, but Stanford not only took the lead at 9‚Äì8, but extended the lead to 16‚Äì10. The two teams played evenly for some time, and with just under six minutes to go in the first half, the Cardinal still held a six-point lead, 22‚Äì16. UConn pulled out to a four-point lead by halftime, although Mosqueda-Lewis had not yet scored. She would make up for that in the second half with 15 points, one of five players in double digits. In the second half, Stanford had an early three-point shot to cut the lead to three, but they would not score again for over five minutes, by which time the margin reach 17 points at 44‚Äì27. UConn would go on to win by 19 points, 75‚Äì56. 2014 UConn National Championship teams at the White House The win by UConn in the semi-final game, coupled with the win by Notre Dame over Maryland in the other semi-final set up the Championship game between two undefeated teams, a theme that has been repeated in the media. Sports Illustrated summed it up by calling it \\"one of the most anticipated games in the sport's history\\". It is the first time in NCAA history that two unbeaten teams met in the championship game. The two teams are not unfamiliar with each other; both teams were in the Big East Conference until UConn joined the AAC and Notre Dame joined the ACC. The teams played each other 16 times since the 2009‚Äì10 season; in many cases, with much on the line. Most of the games affected conference standings, were conference title games or NCAA Final Four games. Three of the game went to overtime. Because the two teams were now in different conferences, it was the first time in many years the two teams had not met in the regular season. UConn would take an early lead in the game. Notre Dame's best post player, Natalie Achonwa, was not playing due to an ACL injury, so UConn pushed the ball inside. They would end up with a 52‚Äì22 points in the paint advantage, the \\"most dominating post performance women's basketball has witnessed in a title game\\". After pulling out to a 14-point lead midway through the first half, the Irish responded to cut the lead to seven by halftime. However, Sports Illustrated's Richard Deitsch warned in a pre-game write-up \\"...UConn has always been a team of runs (\\"spurtability,\\" as Clark Kellogg would say) especially early in the second half\\". The second half opened with the teams trading baskets, but over the next seven minutes, UConn scored 16 of the next 18 points, to extend the lead from seven to 21 points. UConn would go on to win their ninth National Championship game by the same margin 79‚Äì58. The 40 wins tied an NCAA record set by Baylor two years ago. Roster Schedule This is the first year that UConn is in the new American Athletic Conference. In addition to a home and home with the nine other members in the conference. The out of conference schedule includes two out of three of the other Final Four participants from the prior year, as well as games against Baylor and Stanford. UConn will be part of the Hall of Fame classic, which includes a game in Springfield against Ohio State. In December, Connecticut will travel to Durham, North Carolina to play Duke in the Jimmy V Classic. - ! colspan=12 style=\\"background:#002868; color:#FFFFFF;\\"Exhibition - ! colspan=12 style=\\"background:#DC143C; color:#FFFFFF;\\"Regular Season - ! colspan=12 style=\\"background:#808080;\\"2014 AAC Tournament - ! colspan=12 style=\\"background:#0064A8;\\"2014 NCAA Tournament First Night For many years, the NCAA earliest allowable date for formal practice was the same day for all basketball teams, both men and women. This led to some teams celebrating the start of the season with an event, often called Midnight Madness. The start time was changed from midnight, and schools adopted various names. In recent years, the NCAA has changed the way the date of initial practice is determined, with slightly different rules for men and women, so the first date can vary by school. Some school still plan a pre-season event, even though that event no longer coincides with the first date of practice. At UConn the event is called \\"First Night\\" In 2013, at Gampel Pavilion, it included player introductions with dance routines. The players from both the men's teams and women's team were assigned to two teams, one coached by women's coach Geno Auriemma and the other coached by men's coach Kevin Ollie. After competing against each other in trivia games where they had to identify cartoon characters drawn by three-year-olds, they played a five-on-five scrimmage, generally with three males and two females on each team. It was a lighthearted affair, with little actual defense, and many dunks. Team Geno won with a late three-pointer by Omar Calhoun. The arena was close to full, with an estimated 10,000 fans in attendance. WNBA draft Dolsen and Hartley were selected in the first round of the draft in consecutive picks. Dolson was chosen 6th, by the Washington Mystics. Hartley was the next player chosen, initially by the Seattle Storm, but traded an hour later to Washington, so the teammates continue to be teammates.

As of 2020, the Drosophila connectome is a work in progress, being obtained by the methods of neural circuit reconstruction. A stack of EM images of an entire brain exist, suitable for sparse tracing of specific circuits. A full connectome of a large portion of the central brain is likewise available. Many of the 76 compartments of the Drosophila brain have connectomes available, and the remainders are subjects of ongoing study. Why Drosophila Connectome research (connectomics) has a number of competing objectives. On the one hand, investigators prefer an organism small enough that the connectome can be obtained in a reasonable amount of time. This argues for a small creature. On the other hand, one of the main uses of a connectome is to relate structure and behavior, so an animal with a large behavioral repertoire is desirable. It's also very helpful to use an animal with a large existing community of experimentalists, and many available genetic tools. Drosophila looks very good on these counts: *The brain contains about 135,000 neurons, small enough to be reconstructed in the near future. *The fruit fly exhibits many complex behaviors. Hundreds of different behaviors (feeding, grooming, flying, mating, learning, and so on) have been qualitatively and quantitatively studied over the years. *The genetics of the fruit fly are well understood, and many (tens of thousands) of genetic variants are available. *There are many electrophysiological, calcium imaging, and other studies ongoing with Drosophila. Current status A high-level connectome, at the level of brain compartments and interconnecting tracts of neurons, exists for the full fly brain. A version of this is available online. Detailed circuit-level connectomes exist for the lamina and a medulla column, both in the visual system of the fruit fly, and the alpha lobe of the mushroom body. In May of 2017 a paper published in bioRxiv presented an electron microscopy image stack of the whole adult female brain at synaptic resolution. The volume is available for sparse tracing of selected circuits. In 2020, a dense connectome of half the central brain of Drosophila was released, along with a web site that allows queries and exploration of this data. The methods used in reconstruction and initial analysis of the connectome followed. A natural question is whether the connectome will allow simulation of the fly's behavior. However, the connectome alone is not sufficient. Additional information needed includes gap junction varieties and locations, identities of neurotransmitters, receptor types and locations, neuromodulators and hormones (with sources and receptors), the role of glial cells, time evolution rules for synapses, and more.

He is known for his use of environmentally sound architecture and alternative energy in his designs. In 2010, he was inducted into the AIA College of Fellows. Currently, he is principal of Gwynne Pugh Urban Studio, a firm he founded in 2010.  Early life  Born in Cardiff, Wales, Pugh was raised in Greece and Turkey. Pugh has been practicing architecture, planning, civil, structural and design engineering since 1971. He earned his Bachelor of Science in engineering degree at the University of Leeds and his Master of Architecture degree from UCLA.http://microsight.interiordesign.net/HallofFame/544905-Gwynne_Pugh_and_Lawrence_Scarpa.php Career Pugh began his career at Posford Pavry & Partners, a London engineering firm. After completing his architectural engineering degree at the University of Leeds, Pugh moved to the United States to study architecture at UCLA, where he earned his Master of Architecture. He then worked in the LA Area for several years before forming his own small firm in 1984: Gwynne Pugh AIA & Associates. Here he established his reputation as an expert in construction, engineering, and design. He completed a variety of projects, ranging from bridges, to residential remodels, to a Disneyland hotel. In 1988, Pugh hired Lawrence Scarpa. Three years later they decided to become partners, changing their practice to Pugh + Scarpa. The two operated as principals for the entity until 2010, when they split up to pursue separate design interests. Pugh is very involved in the local California community with his work in architecture, urban design, and consulting. He is the past Chair of the Santa Monica Planning Commission and serves as a consultant to the City.http://www.surfsantamonica.com/ssm_site/the_lookout/news/News-2011/May-2011/05_20_2011_Pugh_Leaves_Planning_Commission.htm He has served as a consultant to other cities in California, including Long Beach and Carson. He is an LEED-Accredited Professional and is considered an expert on sustainable design and engineering. Sustainable Design Pugh has more than a decade of experience on a wide variety of sustainable projects. As senior principal at Pugh Scarpa Kodama (a collaboration between Pugh + Scarpa and Kodama Diseno), the firm designed the Colorado Court affordable housing project in downtown Santa Monica. This building was the first building of its type in the country to be energy neutral and the first of its kind to receive an LEED Gold rating.http://www.smgov.net/Department/OSE/Categories/Green_Building/Colorado_Court_Project.aspx The Project has received numerous awards since its completion in 2002, including the 2003 AIA Cote 'Top Ten Green Building' Award, National Housing Award, and the 2003 National AIA Design Award. Other major sustainable projects Pugh has been involved in throughout his career include: the Lofts at Cherokee Studio, Step Up on Fifth, Bergamot Station Arts Complex and Artists' Lofts, Siquieros Mural, and the Rosa Parks multi-family housing complex. Community Pugh is very involved in the local California community, including serving as past Chair of the Santa Monica Planning Commission. Under his watch, the Commission updated the Land Use & Circulation Element to generate a new code for the City that will encourage design excellence in future developments and provide benefit to the community. Pugh also has experience working with local community groups and public and private agencies, serving as a Peer Review Consultant to the city of Carson, the City of Los Angeles, and the Getty Conservation Institute. Additionally, he previously served on the California Redevelopment Association on Sustainability and Green Redevelopment. Currently, he serves on the Board of Directors for AIALA. Urban Studio In 2010, Pugh left Pugh + Scarpa, the firm he co-founded and built, to form his new enterprise, Gwynne Pugh Urban Studio (GP-US). He founded GP-US out of his desire to explore urban design and interact more with cities.http://www.residentialarchitect.com/architects/a-q- and-a-with-gwynne-pugh-faia-leed-ap.aspx His company focuses on architectural and urban design services, in addition to urban planning and consulting services to both private companies and public entities. Gwynne Pugh Urban Studio is based in Santa Monica and is well noted in the press for its tenant improvement project for a high-profile animation studio in Santa Monica. Along with Andy Waisler, Pugh completed an adaptive reuse of a 1940s bowstring and brick warehouse. This project won special mention in the Architecture + Workspace category of Architizer's A+ Awards and has appeared in numerous print and online publications. Currently, Pugh is focusing on urban design, with interest in how public architecture and developer architecture interact in the built environment. As an architect, he believes in involvement and curiosity about the environment, and not only experimenting with the urban fabric and design, but also doing so in a manner that makes sense in the context of a project's surroundings.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POZYmfXZT0k He went into architecture with a determination to create transformative work, not from the singular perspective of creating objects to be admired, but from a philosophical perspective that actively incorporates sustainable and urban principles into architecture and integrates architecture into the fabric of our daily lives.http://www.gwynnepugh.com/histroy In the future, he looks to expand more into interacting with various cities. In an interview with Residential Architect, he notes, \\"What's really interesting is this place in between planning and architecture. I'm trying to see how cities can maximize what they've got, how they can contribute to the life of the city. Before things are cast in stone, there can be a real discussion about how they can set about that and become more of an interactive place.\\" Notable Works * Santa Monica Animation Studio, Santa Monica, CA.

The first line ran from Aketi to Bondo and was built from leftover German army stocks used in trench railways or heeresfeldbahnen, which the Belgians acquired after World War I. Later, the line was extended from Komba to Buta Pauli (today Isiro) and Mungbere, which was reached in 1937. A planned expansion to the gold mines of Moto never materialized. In 1971 the railway was extended from Aketi along the Itimbiri river, to Bumba along the Congo river, as the water level of the rivers may be only 40 cm, thus functioning as a portage railway. In the early 2000s, operations on the entire length of the line ceased. The system is currently not operational, and was described by United Nations Joint Logistics Centre (UNJLC) in 2006 as 'very degraded'.

Location  Zagora and Ouarzazate M'Hamid lies at an altitude of about 500 meters above sea level and about 24 kilometers from the Algerian border at the edge of the Sahara. M'Hamid can be reached at the end of National Route 9 from Ouarzazate (260 km) via Zagora (approx. 97 km). Mhamid lies on the Wadi Draa, which rarely contains water.  History  Little is known about the early history of the place because of the lack of written records. The spacious palm oases, however, make an early settlement support (about 3000 BC) likely. Due to the growth of the desert, the settlement is threatened since the 2nd half of the 20th century by siltation, and the population is declining steadily. Until the end of the 1980s a special permit was required to enter the area because it is close to the strategically important border with Algeria. Even today, many soldiers stationed in the area of Mhamid.  Economics  Oasis of M'Hamid The people of M'Hamid lived according to the principles of self-sufficiency for hundreds of years but due to reduced or even absent winter rains since the 1970s agriculture provided and less income and was abandoned almost entirely. In addition, a fungal disease (Fusarium oxysporum) has significantly affected the date palms which were already weakened by the drought. View of an ethnographic museum within the qasba of M'hamid. In addition, M'Hamid was always a center for traveling nomads and caravans. Today the town is the starting point for tourist camel and 4x4 safaris into the desert.

In recent decades new houses have been built in M'Hamid in the typical construction of the Marrocan South on concrete floors with walls of hollow concrete blocks which are painted bright red. Desert winds carry always masses of sand in the city.  Surroundings  Hidden in the palm oases of M'Hamid are seven old, now almost uninhabited, and decaying ksars. Approximately 50-60 kilometers away lie the sometimes more than 100 meters high sand dunes of Erg Chigaga, which are less often visited by tourists than those in Merzouga.

While the federation is a founding member and the youth organisation of the European Pirate Party, it is an independent organisation with both Pirate and non-Pirate affiliated member organisations. It was founded in August 2013 and is officially registered in Luxembourg. The association is managed by a board of up to 7 members. It was founded as a non-profit organisation in Sweden, but has changed its registered seat a number of times. On 19 September 2014, the original Swedish organisation was disbanded and YPE was founded anew as a Belgian organisation. In this process, Mlad√≠ Pir√°ti, the Czech pirate youth organisation as well as Junge Pirat*innen from Austria both became founding members. Ung Pirat, one of the original founding members, however, left the organisation because its delegates were not appointed to found a new organisation and vote on behalf of Ung Pirat in their assembly. On 21 August 2015, the organisation was refounded once more as a non-profit organisation with seat in Luxembourg with Junge Pirat*innen √ñsterreichs (Austria), Piraattinuoret (Finland), Jeunes Pirates (France), Junge Piraten (Germany), Ungir P√≠ratar (Iceland) and Ung Pirat (Sweden) as founding members. During its EPIC (General Assembly) 2016, Young Pirates of Europe accepted the membership request of Falanster (Belarus) and changed its goals and membership requirements to reflect its changed relationship to the European Pirate Parties. From now on the \\"main goal of YPE is to bring together European pirate youth organisations and other youth organisations that work on digital issues and for transparency in government, participating democracy and civil rights as well as their members, improving not only the coordination of their political work, but also supporting cultural and personal exchange\\" and member organisations no longer have to be affiliated with the Pirate Party in their home country as long as they support the policy goals of YPE. At EPIC 2018, the accession of Mlad√≠ pir√°ti (Czechia) and Mladi Pirati Slovenije (Slovenia), was approved, with the Czech MP and President of Mlad√≠ pir√°ti, Franti≈°ek Kop≈ôiva (MP), becoming President. The same year, Jeunes Pirates' (France) membership was deemed to of lapsed due to their continued non-existence, and they were expelled from the organisation.  Structure  Young Pirates of Europe is divided into two bodies: the Council and the Board. The Council (European Pirates Instituted Council, EPIC) is the highest body of YPE. It meets annually and elects the Board and up to two auditors. In addition to the approval of the financial statements of the previous year and the budget for the coming year, it may decide on the discharge of the Board and the auditors. The Council also decides on the motions submitted by a member organisation or the Board. The voters of the Council consist of up to two delegates from each of the member organisations. An extraordinary meeting (EPIC FAIL) may be requested by the Board or one third of the members. The Board consists of the President, a Treasurer, the Secretary General and up to four other members. The members of the Board may not be older than 29 years at the beginning of their term of office. The President represents the Young Pirates of Europe in the public and takes care of the regular board meetings. The Treasurer is responsible for the budget and the accounts of the organisation. For this purpose they shall report to the members semi-annually and examine the finances of the member associations. The Secretary General represents the organisation towards its member organisations and organises most activities.

Addo bush in the background by Homer LeRoy Shantz (1919) A fanciful scene in the Tsitsikamma Forest, strangely showing Asian elephants by Samuel Daniell circa 1801 The Knysna elephants are a very small number of African bush elephants (Loxodonta africana), a relict population of large herds which roamed the Tsitsikamma Forest and surrounding regions at the southern tip of Africa until the 1800s and 1900s, when contact with European farmers and hunters led to their near extinction. It is conjectured that about 1,000 elephants historically roamed the Outeniqua/Tsitsikamma area. A 2006 DNA analysis of dung samples has revealed the presence of at least 5 cows and possibly some bulls and calves, moving within an area of 121,000 hectares of forest managed by South African National Parks, and constituting the only unfenced elephant group in South Africa. By 2019, researchers have concluded that there is only one elephant, a mature female, remaining in Knysna. History of decline Ivory hunting and loss of habitat to agriculture had all but exterminated elephants from the Cape region of Africa by 1900. The last elephant in the vicinity of the Cape peninsula was killed in 1704 and elephant populations west of the Knysna region were extirpated prior to 1800. By 1775 the remaining Cape elephants had retreated into forests along the foothills of the Outeniqua / Tsitsikamma coastal mountain range around Knysna, and dense scrub-thickets of the Addo bushDudley, J.P. 1996. African elephants in coastal refuges. Pachyderm 21: 78-83. IUCN/SSC African Elephant and Rhino Specialist Group, Nairobi. As far back as 1870 it was estimated that only some 400 elephants remained out of the enormous numbers that had been observed in and about these southern forests in earlier centuries. Captain Harison, Conservator of Forests between 1856 and 1888, petitioned the Cape Colonial Government to formally protect the elephants and forests, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. By 1919 a large herd was peacefully centered about the Addo area of the Eastern Cape. Farmers in this area had been sold their farms at greatly reduced rates and favourable terms because of the elephant presence. Nevertheless, these farmers complained to the authorities about damage to their crops, broken water pipelines and reservoirs and even loss of lives, though it later transpired that the lives lost were those of hunters tracking and killing elephants. Responding to the complaints, the Cape Provincial Administration on 25 November 1919 hired a professional hunter, Major Philip Jacobus Pretorius, to exterminate all elephants in the region. Initially only a reduction in numbers was contemplated, but on 1 April 1919, the Administrator of the Cape, Sir Frederic de Waal, argued in favour of total extermination of all the elephants. By January 1920 it was decided to preserve 16 elephants which were to be left in the Addo Reserve. In the space of little more than a year, between 12 June 1919 and August 1920, Pretorius single- handedly reduced the population of elephants from about 130 to the 16 individuals which were to be spared. Later, Pretorius applied for and was granted permission by the government in 1920 to shoot one of the sequestered 16. The shooting accounted for five more elephants. Spoils from the initial part of the campaign went to the Province, but from January 1920 on they were the property of Pretorius, who had been approached by various museums for specimens to add to their collections ‚Äì the South African Museum received four, the Amathole Museum two and eight to the British Museum of Natural History.\\"Major P.J. Pretorius and the decimation of the Addo elephant herd in 1919-1920\\" - M.T. Hoffman Pretorius had been requested to record measurements of the elephants that he had shot, but these were never made available. Remnants in the 21st Century The scattered remnants of the herds had to regroup and modify their behaviour in order to survive. Within a short period they developed the skills necessary to live in forest and fynbos and avoid hunters. Their range had been substantially reduced and their diet had to change as they had access to less grass. There were believed to be as few as four to seven individuals roaming the Knysna forests in 1950, and a survey conducted in 1969-1970 estimated the population at about 14 individuals in 1970. There were believed to be only four Knysna elephants remaining in the Gouna/Diepwalle forests between 1976 and 1994, and the population was reported in 1996 to have been functionally extirpated with only a single adult female still presentDudley, J.P. 1996.

Nevertheless, in September 2000 a forest guard, Wilfred Oraai, videotaped a young bull from a distance of about thirty metres, immediately raising questions about its provenance. Conservationist Gareth Patterson has collected numerous fresh samples of elephant dung for DNA analysis by geneticist Lori S. Eggert from the University of Missouri in Columbia. In its passage through the digestive system, dung scrapes against the walls of the intestines and as a result contains DNA from the relevant animal. Analysis suggests at least five females within the population, while Patterson's fieldwork suggests the additional presence of three bulls and two calves. Despite the DNA evidence, official sources insisted that only one elephant had survived, an elusive female known as \\"the Matriarch\\" or \\"Oupoot\\", making the Knysna elephant functionally extinct. In the 1990s, in an effort to bolster the numbers, some juvenile elephants were introduced from the Kruger National Park. It was believed at that time that the Knysna elephants survived strictly within the forest, and when the introduced elephants were seen feeding only at forest margins and in fynbos, they were thought not to have adapted to the forest environment and were retrieved some five years later.\\"The Search for the Knysna Elephants\\"http://penguin.bookslive.co.za/blog/2009/09/09/gareth- pattersons-the-secret-elephants-pierces-the-mysteries-of-the-knysna- forest/\\"The Knysna Elephants\\" - Sylvia Ferguson\\"In search of the rarest elephants\\" - Nicole Schafer In 2016, an elephant believed to be Oupoot was photographed by a ranger.

Giura was the Inspector of the Corps of Bridges and Roads of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Giura is most famous for the design and construction of the second suspension bridge in Europe, the first in continental Europe, in 1832. Biography Giura was born in 1795 in Maschito, a small Arb√´resh√´ town in the Vulture-Melfi in Basilicata. Giura's parents were Francis Xavier Giura and Victoria Pascale. Giura received his first schooling in Maschito at the school of the Fathers of St. Joseph Calasanz and then at the seminary in Melfi; he later moved to Naples to attend university courses. Giura was a member of the initial group of students at the School of Bridges and Roads promoted by King Gioacchino Murat in his Decree of March 4th, 1811. The school, during Giura's attendance, was directed by Carlo Afan de Rivera, now the school has become the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Naples Federico II. Giura graduated in 1814 and was admitted to the Corps of Bridges and Roads, where he began a series of study tours in Britain and France. During these tours Giura was able to check the progression being made in the field of engineering and obtain new perspectives from the industrial development of these countries. At that time the governments of the more underdeveloped countries were trying to acquire information and data to get a hold of newly developed technologies, they went about this by sending their best technicians into the field--an activity that variously hindered or encouraged the country's progress. The Corps of Bridges and Roads (forerunner of the Neapolitan Civil Engineers), from 1820‚Äì40, established a series of interventions in the territory as Regi Lagni, channels for the flow of water in critical mountain areas, and as a result, it attracted the attention of the old French masters. In 1860, Giura returned to the School of Bridges and Roads as director. Garibaldi recognized Giura's ability and wanted him as the Minister of Public Works for the provisional government that was serving at the time. Giura developed the arrangement of the eastern side of Naples, commonly known as \\"The Railway\\", which provided the connection between the Real Albergo dei Poveri and Piliero allowing a pass through the railway terminals at the ancient city walls. The project was partially implemented after his death in 1865. Giura's fame comes primarily from his suspension bridge designs: the Bridge Real Ferdinando sul Garigliano, which was the first suspension bridge built in continental Europe, in 1832; and the Maria Cristina Bridge on the River Calore near Benevento, completed in 1835. These accomplishments had significant effects in terms of economies and in the challenging aspect of the design. Giura also created aesthetically pleasing solutions to construction problems. The metal building components were produced in the foundries of an arms factory in Mongiana. The state funded the construction. The Real Ferdinand Bridge was partially demolished by the retreating German divisions in 1943. The Maria Cristina Bridge, after being damaged in 1851 and promptly repaired by Giura, was completely blown into the air by German sappers in 1943. Other achievements Giura is remembered for are: *before the Naples train station, the terminus of the Napoli-Nocera/Castellammare railway *supervising the construction of the Napoli-Nocera/Castellammare, now the Naples‚ÄìSalerno railway *the rebuilding of the dome (1852) of the Church of the Girolamini, Naples After his death, Giura was buried in the Cemetery of Poggioreale.

History The Hampden Watch Company was originally known as the Mozart Watch Company. In 1866, Donald J. Mozart founded the company in Providence, Rhode Island. The firm manufactured time pieces. Unfortunately for Mozart, this company soon failed, but in 1867, he reorganized the firm as the New York Watch Company, with production facilities in Springfield, Massachusetts. Three years later, the company's factory burnt to the ground. Finally, in 1877, the company reopened, now doing business as the Hampden Watch Company.The Deuber Hampden Watch Factory - Canton, OHIn 1864 John C. Dueber founded the Dueber Watch Case Company in Cincinnati, Ohio to manufacture cases for fine watches. In 1886, Dueber, who had been making cases for the Hampden Watch Company, purchased a controlling interest in the company. About this time an anti-trust law was passed and the watch case manufacturers formed a boycott against Dueber's company. In 1888, Dueber bought Hampden and moved both companies to a dual set of factory buildings in Canton, Ohio. In their first year in Canton, the combined firms employed almost 10% of the city's population. 19th Century trade card for the company. By 1890, the company was producing quality watches, and introduced the first size 16, 23 jewel movement made in America. In 1923, the two businesses merged to become the Dueber-Hampden Watch Company. In 1925, John Dueber sold the company to Walter Vrettman. In 1927, falling sales led to the company going into receivership. In 1930, Amtorg Trading Corporation purchased the Dueber-Hampden Watch Company together with all of the manufacturing equipment, parts on hand, and work in progress, in order to build a factory in Russia. 28 boxcars of machinery left Canton, together with 21 Dueber Hampden employees to teach the Russians the craft of watchmaking. In 1931, the First State Watch Factory produced pocket watches that were presented at a ceremonial meeting in the Revolution Theater. The Hampden pattern watch movements were called the Type-1, easily recognized by its distinct twin finger bridge layout. As the Nazi army closed in on Moscow, during Autumn of 1941, the factory was hurriedly evacuated to Zlatoust, where more than 300,000 Zlatoust Type-1 watches and clocks were made. By 1943, the Moscow factory was re-established and renamed the First Moscow Watch Factory and continued the manufacture of pocket watches and stopwatches, as well as the Type-1 191-ChS watch for Soviet Navy divers. This watch, whose diameter, not including the crown, is about 2 1/4 inches (60mm), weighed 8 1/2 ounces (about 260g). In 1970 production of these unique Type-1 191-ChS watches was stopped.

The film examines how the concept of virginity shapes the sexual lives of young women and men through the intersecting forces of history, politics, religion and popular culture. It premiered at DOC NYC, a New York City documentary festival, on November 17, 2013.  Synopsis  How to Lose Your Virginity explores the concept of virginity from historical origins of the word, virgin, to the modern day definitions perpetuated in popular culture. The film takes a critical look at how virginity is ‚Äòrestored‚Äô through hymenoplasty, fetishized by pornography, and celebrated at purity balls. Linking virginity culture to commerce, the film follows Natalie Dylan's virginity auction and the sales of artificial hymen on the internet. Shechter also visits the set of Barely Legal and discusses the success of the \\"virginity porn\\" genre. How to Lose Your Virginity questions the effectiveness of the Abstinence-only sex education movement and observes how sexuality continues to define a young woman's morality and self-worth. The meaning and necessity of virginity as a social construct is also examined through narration and interviews with notable sexuality experts, such as: former Surgeon General Dr. Joycelyn Elders, \\"Scarleteen\\" creator and editor Heather Corinna, historian Hanne Blank, author Jessica Valenti, and comprehensive sex education advocate Shelby Knox.  Production  The film was directed by Therese Shechter, whose production company Trixie Films is based in Brooklyn. Working with Producer Lisa Esselstein, How to Lose Your Virginity was shot over several years in the U.S. and Canada. Other films produced by Trixie Films include the documentary feature I Was A Teenage Feminist and the documentary shorts \\"How I Learned to Speak Turkish\\" and \\"#slutwalknyc\\". Shechter was inspired to make the film because of the growing abstinence until marriage movement and her own experiences as an older virgin. While making the film, Shechter became engaged and incorporated trying on white wedding dresses into the film as a way of looking at how the wedding industry sells virginity./ Over the course of the film's production, its transmedia companion, The V-Card Diaries has crowd- sourced over 200 stories about what the site calls \\"sexual debuts and deferrals.\\" It was exhibited at The Kinsey Institute's 8th Annual Juried Art Show, the exhibit's first interactive piece.  Critical reception  Soraya Chemaly wrote in the Huffington Post, \\"Virginity is a powerful and malleable concept, as evidenced by the teenagers in Therese Shechter's smart, funny and provoking documentary.\\" Leigh Kolb of Bitch Flicks said that \\"There's no anger, there's no judgment‚Ä¶Shechter‚Äôs ability to teach, dismantle, expose and explore is remarkable. The audience is left with newfound knowledge with which they can criticize myths of virginity in our culture. However, the audience is also left with respect for everyone‚Äôs stories. When a documentary can do that, it succeeds in a big way.\\" In the Jakarta Globe, Paul Freelend wrote that \\"her work to highlight what she calls the 'virginity culture' and the misconceptions surrounding it may resonate as loudly in Indonesia and other developing countries as in the United States.\\" Basil Tsoikos, programmer for the Sundance Film Festival and DOC NYC, in What (not) to doc remarked that \\"Shechter seems like the perfect filmmaker to tackle the complexities around virginity. It‚Äôs a topic that far too many people are obsessed about ‚Äì probably for all the wrong reasons ‚Äì so the film is sure to stimulate interest and provoke heated debate.\\" J. Maureen Henderson of Forbes.com said that Shechter's work \\"tackles one of the last taboos in our culture‚Äôs discussion of sex ‚Äì the deliberate decision not to participate in it.‚Äù Lena Corner of The Guardian wrote that \\"It‚Äôs refreshing to hear such forthright voices in a world where any debate about virginity is often so conflicting or one-sided.\\" Jennifer Wadsworth of SFGate.com remarked that the project is \\"More than just a narrative about virginity.

He is famous for being the only person to have been legally executed in Pacific County, Washington, and for his death row prison break supposedly arranged by the very jailers charged with his captivity. Biography Lum You was among the many Chinese laborers who came to Washington near the turn of the century. A proud, sociable dandy, You was well-liked in the white community. He spoke a little English, and acted as an agent between the Chinese workers and their employers. In 1894 You approached the South Bend police chief, Marion Egbert, complaining that a fellow Chinese resident by the name of Ging had threatened him. Egbert brushed You off and suggested he deal with the situation himself. You took this advice, attacking Ging with an axe. For this act he was convicted of assault; he was fined $500 and was sentenced to a prison term of six months. In the summer of 1901, You was employed as a cannery worker and living in Bay Center. While playing cards on August 6 of that year, he was assaulted, threatened, and robbed by Oscar Bloom, a white man with a reputation as a bully. This time You did not approach the police, but instead immediately took matters into his own hands: he went to his room to retrieve his gun, sought out and shot Bloom in the abdomen, and then fled the scene. Bloom survived long enough to swear a deathbed affidavit identifying You as his killer. Public sympathy for You was high, but white employers of the Chinese workers pressed officials for action to be taken against him. Accordingly, You was arrested on August 7 and in October 1901 was tried and convicted for the murder of Oscar Bloom. Contrary to the jurors' belief that You would receive a light sentence, the judge ordered that You be hanged. The execution was scheduled for January 31, 1902. Even after his conviction You continued to enjoy public support. Petitions for clemency, one of which was signed by one of the jurors, were sent to the state governor. County officials sympathized with You, supposedly leaving his cell door unlocked at night and encouraging him to escape. You eventually did escape, early in the morning of January 14: one news report claimed the improvised lock to his cell door had been picked with the aid of a confederate. You hid in the environs of South Bend for several days, during which he was hunted by a squad led by sheriff Thomas A. Roney. On January 15 he was sighted by two men; the following day the county commissioners met and agreed to offer a reward of $200 for You's capture. On January 17 You was finally apprehended by a three-man posse. You offered no resistance, and when asked how he escaped, said only that the door was open and he walked out. Invitation to Lum You's execution. On January 27 governor Henry McBride rejected one of the petitions for clemency on procedural grounds, and on January 30 confirmed by wire that he would not be commuting You's sentence. Anticipation of the execution became so great that Roney was besieged with requests to attend. Roney issued 500 invitation cards, some examples of which survive. You's hanging proceeded as planned inside the courthouse of the county seat, South Bend, on the morning of January 31, 1902. Though it had been expected that he would break down, You ate fairly well that morning and went to the gallows without assistance. He bade his friends goodbye and then uttered his last words, to his executioners: \\"Kill me good.\\" The trap was sprung by means of a rope which, along with three dummy ropes, extended into an adjoining room. Each of the four executioners concealed in that room pulled his rope simultaneously, but only the sheriff knew which was the trigger. You's was the first and only official execution ever to take place in Pacific County. A month after his arrest, a new act of the Washington State Legislature took effect which required executions for any future crimes to be carried out at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. Legacy Lum You's trial and execution attracted a great deal of contemporary publicity in Pacific County, and has since passed into the realm of folk legend. His story has been researched and recounted by local historians Ruth Dixon, Willard R. Espy, and Sydney Stevens. Espy, also a nationally renowned poet, memorialized You in a humorous epitaph. You was also the subject of a biographical play performed in the early 1980s, The Hanging of Lum You by the Oysterville-based Shoalwater Storytellers.

Notable for his religious zeal, Mihr Narseh was the architect behind the Roman‚ÄìSasanian War of 421‚Äì422 and the Battle of Avarayr.  Etymology  The name of Mihr Narseh is a combination of the Middle Iranian theophoric names of Mihr (Mithra) and Narse(h).  Background  Mihr-Narseh was born in the 4th-century in the village of Abruwan in the rural district of Dasht-e Barin in the administrative division of Ardashir-Khwarrah, in southwestern Pars. He belonged to the House of Suren, one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran. The family, of Parthian origin, had been active in Iranian politics since the Arsacid Empire, and held parts of Sakastan as their personal fiefdom. It was thus unusual for a Surenid to be a native of Pars, which illustrates their extensive authority and influence during this period, which made them able to spread their influence to Pars, the homeland of the ruling Persian Sasanian family. It is unknown if the Suren branch of Pars adopted the title of Parsig (Persian). Mihr Narseh was the son of a certain Boraza, who may have owned the land Mihr Narseh was born in. According to the medieval historian al-Tabari (d. 923), Mihr Narseh traced his descent back to the legendary Kayanian king Vishtaspa and the first Arsacid king, Arsaces I ().  Career  At the end of Yazdegerd I's reign, Mihr Narseh was appointed as his minister (wuzurg framadar). He continued to maintain the position under Bahram V, where Suren power reached its zenith. Mihr Narseh's three sons also occupied high offices; Zurvandad served as the chief herbad of the empire; Mahgushnasp was the wastaryoshan salar (\\"chief agriculturalist\\"), which meant that he oversaw the affairs of the land tax; Kardar was the arteshtaran-salar (\\"chief of the warriors\\"), a rank, which according to al-Tabari, was higher than that of spahbed (\\"army chief\\"). The power and influence of the Suren family thus spread over the administrative, financial, and military affairs of the Sasanian Empire. Mihr Narseh was the prime instigator of the Roman‚ÄìSasanian War of 421‚Äì422, and himself led the army in battle. In 453, Yazdegerd II moved his court to Nishapur in Abarshahr to face the threat from the Hephthalites and left Mihr Narseh in charge of the Sasanian Empire. Mihr Narseh later retired in Pars. He may have been succeeded by Suren Pahlav, another member of the Suren clan.  Constructions  Firuzabad In the early 5th-century, Mihr Narseh had a bridge built in Gor. An inscription was also written on the bridge, which says; \\"This bridge was built by order of Mihr-Narseh, wuzurg framadƒÅr, for his soul's sake and at his own expense... Whoever has come on this road let him give a blessing to Mihr-Narseh and his sons for that he thus bridged this crossing.\\" Furthermore, he also founded four villages with a fire-temple in each of them. The name of the fire-temples were; Faraz-mara- awar-khwadaya, Zurvandadan, Kardadan, and Mahgushnaspan. He had a fifth fire- temple constructed in Abruwan, which may have been the Barin fire-temple that the 10th-century Persian geographer Istakhri visited, who stated that the fire-temple had an inscription that stated 30,000 dirhams was spent for its construction.

The complex comprises an offshore hotel (Crescent Hotel), office tower (Crescent City), residential tower, and a retail and entertainment centre (Crescent Place). The project is intended to be an architectural landmark of Azerbaijan.Crescent Hotel History In February 2008, skyscrapernews.com, a well-known architectural review website, published an article about two projects designed by the Korean company, Heerim Architects, for construction in Baku. The projects, both with a lunar theme, were described as, \\"an attempt to reinvent the concept of the skyscraper beyond the traditional\\". The article described two skyscraper complexes, proposed for construction on neighbouring peninsulas, on opposite shores of Baku Bay. The first, Full Moon Bay, was to be constructed on the western side of the bay. It included a 158-meter, 35-storey, discoid hotel called \\"Palace of the Winds 1 and 2\\". The second complex, \\"Caspian Plus\\", had been proposed for construction on the eastern edge of Baku Bay near the seaport, acting as a counterpoint to \\"Full Moon Bay\\". Initially, the second project included a 32-storey crescent-shaped hotel (standing on its \\"horns\\" offshore), four high-rise residential buildings, and a 43-story business centre standing 203 metres tall (now called Crescent City Tower). The fate of the related projects remained uncertain until October 2009 when foundation work in the location of the \\"Caspian Plus\\" complex was started. The project has since been modified. A trio of high-rise residential buildings was removed to avoid visual overlapping of two other buildings (Port Baku Towers and Port Baku Residence). After modification, the project consisted of a hotel (\\"The Crescent Hotel\\"), an office tower (\\"The Crescent City\\"), and a high-rise residential building with a podium (\\"The Crescent Place\\"). The previous name of the project, \\"Caspian Plus\\", was changed to \\"The Crescent Development Project\\".Lotos.com The project Full Moon Bay was cancelled. Project The \\"Crescent Development Project\\" is situated with one part on the waterfront of Baku. An offshore part, which includes \\"The Crescent Hotel\\", will be located on an artificial island about 170 metres from shore. There will be an office tower (\\"The Crescent City\\"), and a residential high-rise building with a podium (\\"The Crescent Place\\"), on the coastline behind \\"The Crescent Hotel\\". =The Crescent Hotel= \\"The Crescent Hotel\\" is a curving arched building. It is designed to look like a crescent moon with its points on the surface of the Caspian Sea. The crescent shape of the building refers to one of the symbols of Azerbaijan, depicted on its national flag. The skyscraper‚Äôs arcuate configuration will not affect the interior of the hotel as the building will rely on two multi-storey column-like towers, which will create additional space and act as a support for the hotel. These supporting towers are called Eastern and Western in accordance with their location. \\"The Crescent Hotel\\" comprises 32 floors (28 storeys of the hotel itself standing over a 4-storeys podium). Upon completion, the hotel will comprise 230 guest rooms, 74 apartments and 16 villas. The total area is 177 969 m¬≤, parking is planned for 601 cars. \\"The Crescent Hotel\\" will be connected to the shore and other buildings of the project via a bridge. This hotel is planned to be a 'seven- star' facility. =The Crescent City= The office tower ‚ÄúThe Crescent City‚Äù, is a 210-metre skyscraper with 43 overground levels. It is being built behind \\"The Crescent Hotel\\" on the waterfront next to the seaport of Baku and the ‚ÄúJW Marriott Absheron‚Äù. According to the project design, the facade of the building is cylindrical and slightly flattened at the north-south direction. The bottom of the tower is narrow and widens as it approaches the top which includes a concave notch. The shape of \\"The Crescent City\\" is designed to resemble a torch. =The Crescent Place= \\"The Crescent Place\\" consists of 3 basement floors and 32 overground levels: a 5-storey podium, 2 floors of town houses and a 25-storey residential tower with 2 additional penthouse levels. The Crescent Place will be located onshore next to the tower of \\"The Crescent City\\". This residential building, standing 170 metres tall, will include 168 apartments. The total area of the Crescent Place is 273 000 m¬≤ with space for approximately 100 retail outlets and an additional 40 food and beverage units. Construction According to a report published by the management company, almost all piling work for the project had been completed by November 2013. Nine per-cent of the entire project had been constructed. Ten per-cent of the coastal part of the Project had been completed. In July 2015, DSA Architects International was appointed to take over multidisciplinary lead consultancy design services on the Crescent Development Project, with construction works ongoing. =Site of The Crescent Hotel= The plot for \\"The Crescent Hotel\\" lies within an area in the Caspian Sea. In May 2012, sheet pile setting was started. These piles were installed in two rows around the perimeter of the future hotel's location. A double metal fence was then installed around the site which restricted any additional water entering the area. Once the fence was completed, water was pumped from the site and it was filled with sand to create the foundation of the building. As of early 2013, the soil creating the artificial island has been formed, and foundation work for the Western and Eastern towers is completed.New stage of works at ‚ÄúCrescent‚Äù area The piles constructed for \\"The Crescent Hotel\\", with a diameter 1500‚Äì2000 mm and a length 76.1 meters, are the biggest ever built in Azerbaijan. It was planned to build 464 piles by the end of 2013.Lotos.com.azLotos.com.az By the beginning of 2015, development of both the Eastern and Western Towers had begun on the artificial island. Given the complexity of the building‚Äôs geometry, a number of contracting companies from the world-wide were engaged in the construction. Many of them faced challenges in achieving their goals. So, Derby Design Engineering cited that the main challenge was to design a constructible solution for the link- bridge between the column-like towers. This arch has a span of 90 meters which supports 5 hotel levels, hanging off the link-bridge truss. The Koltay Facades website stated that curved sides of the hotel represent an exciting challenge for engineers and designers; floor by floor, the slope of the glass is changing, and so are the components of the reaction forces on the slab, the appearance of the glass, the safety requirements, amongst the others. . =Sites of The Crescent City and Crescent Place= Construction of the onshore foundation started in October 2009. For all parts of the coastline (sites of \\"The Crescent City\\" and \\"The Crescent Place\\"), 691 short piles with a diameter of 1.2 m and a depth of 26 meters have been installed .Lotos.com.az: Completion work on short piles For the tower ‚ÄúThe Crescent city‚Äù 118 deep piles (diameter 1500 mm, depth of 52-61,5 meters) were constructed.Lotos.com.azMalaysian company intends to participate in the project Crescent City in Baku By November 2013, 4 taps had been installed on the site of \\"The Crescent Place\\". First floors of the podium were appearing above the fence. The construction of the residential tower, \\"The Crescent Place\\", had been started. By the beginning of 2015, 35th floor of The Crescent Place Tower was being constructed. By March 2014, the foundation of \\"Crescent City Tower\\" had been ready for concrete core pouring. As of beginning 2015, The Crescent City Tower was being constructed at 16-17 levels. In August 2015, the concrete core of the building reached up to the 30th level. By December 2015, the 43rd level of the concrete core of the Crescent City was completed. = Completion = According to a spokesman of Ilk Construction, completion of the shell and core of \\"The Crescent Place\\" is scheduled for January 2015; the site of \\"The Crescent City\\" must be finished by May of the same year. Completion of the entire project was planned for the second half of 2017 but as of February 2019, technical difficulties have prevented the completion of the arch section that will ultimately join the two towers. The completion date is currently estimated as late 2020.[http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/complex/1373 Skyscraper City  Gallery  File:Crescent site 01.08.2012.jpgConstruction site (01.08.2012): It is seen the fenced area of the sea designated for \\"The Crescent Hotel\\"; piling works are being conducted for onshore part of the project File:Crescent cite 17.08.2012.jpgConstruction site (17.08.2012): Offshore site is being filled with sand in order to create artificial island File:Crescent site 01.03.2013.jpgConstruction site (01.03.2013): An island has been created, beginning of piles testing on it; piling works for the onshore part is being completed File:Crescent site 30.04.2013.jpgConstruction site (30.04.2013): Beginning of the piles construction on island; onshore part is ready for construction the podium File:The Crescent 18 March 2014.jpgConstruction site (18.03.2014): Podium, rising of Crescent Place concrete core, parking File:The Crescent Hotel Piles.jpgCompletion of piling works for The Crescent Hotel on artificial island (18.03.2014) File:CR1.jpgFebruary 2015: General view on the project, Crescent Place is topped out, Crescent City is built at 18-19 levels, the first floors of The Crescent Hotel' towers are being built on the island File:Crescent 2.jpgFebruary 2015: The Crescent City and The Crescent Hotel File:Crescent Baku (2).jpgMarch 2015: View on The Crescent Place and The Crescent Hotel File:Crescent Hotel Baku.jpgMarch 2015: Construction of The Crescent Hotel References External links * Heerim Architects & Planners * GilanHolding.com * www.dsa-arch.com *ThorntonTomasetti.com * Lotos.com * ilkconstruction.com * AZ Architecture & Engineering Developments (AZ A&E;) * Alt URL * Archiloverz.org * Inside Pictures of Crescent Moon Tower Dubai * Category:Buildings and structures under construction in Azerbaijan Category:Skyscrapers in Azerbaijan Category:Buildings and structures in Baku Category:Skyscraper hotels Category:Skyscraper office buildings Category:Residential skyscrapers Category:Retail buildings in Azerbaijan ","title":"The Crescent Development project"},{"id":"40277979","text":"Live 1967 may refer to: * Live 1967 (The Monkees album) * Live 1967 (Red Krayola album) ","title":"Live 1967"},{"id":"40277999","text":"Star Fireworks is a British company that stages professional fireworks displays and special effects for events.

Vernon Township High School District No. 201 of Jefferson County, Illinois. Mt. Vernon Township High School occupies with a main building and associated sports fields. The school has an enrollment of approximately 1,325 students. The school is fully accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and the State of Illinois.http://www.mvths.org/ History In 1903 the board of Mt. Vernon township decided to establish a dedicated high school for the entire township, and a school board for the high school was created the following year. The school was the successor to the Mt. Vernon City High School, which had been in operation since 1884. The township school district originally had of area. In September 1904 the first building, what would later become B Building, started being built. Mt. Vernon Township High School opened in 1905, with completion in July of that year, an August 15 dedication, and a September 1 start of classes. At its opening the new school had James M. Dixon as the principal, an enrollment of ninety girls and seventy boys, and a faculty of six. At the end of that first year, the class of 1906 had thirteen graduates. Building B initially had a cupola but it was removed by a 1911 storm. Silas Echols, who began working for the school in its opening, became the principal in 1915 upon Dickson's retirement. In 1916 enrollment increased to around 160-260. The graduating class that year numbered 36. Enrollment was reduced during the United States entry into World War I but increased in the 1920s, and there were 503 pupils in 1935. Unlike the city's public grade schools, which were racially segregated until the mid-1950s, the school was integrated from the beginning. As the school's enrollment grew, Buildings A, D, and E buildings were built in 1936 and 1937, with E built first, D built second, and A built last. They were established under the New Deal's Works Progress Administration. The square footage increased by over 100% In 1947 the school had about 48 faculty and 1,300 students. Echols retired that year, replaced by Robert McConnell. In 1949 construction began on a vocational building paid with a $250,000 bond. In the late 1940s the entire school property was worth $900,000. McConnell resigned in June 1950, and he was replaced by Arthur Milward. By the 1950s the township school district had increased in size to . Building F with vocational and music facilities, was added in the 1950s; Eltis Henson became principal in 1961 due to Milward's retirement. There were 80 faculty members and 1,635 students in 1962. At some point in the 1960s Henson left, and Archie Woodrome replaced him. J. D. Shields became superintendent in 1967. Building G was established in 1964, and Building H was established, for career and technical training. in 1978. The campus eventually came to encompass , with eleven buildings and several sports fields. Shields ended his term as superintendent in 1988. J. D. Shields Memorial Stadium was established in 1933, with a dedication that year, as Vernois Field; it was renamed after Shields died. =Mt. Vernon Community College= On October 29, 1955, the voters of the district approved establishing a junior college to accompany the high school. Mt. Vernon Community College operated on the high school campus and several adjacent buildings until its expansion as Rend Lake College (a part of the Illinois Community College System) and its 1970 relocation to its present main campus in Ina, Illinois.http://www.rlc.edu/about-rlc/rlc-history During that period the full name of the institution was Mt. Vernon Township High School and Community College. As a result, tertiary matriculation rates increased from about 11% pre-1956 to about half of the student body after five years. =New campus= Voters approved a bond to build a new high school in April 2011 on a 4,340 to 2,915 basis. FGM Architects was the company that designed the campus. In April 2012 the district announced it was obtaining of land for a new campus, and on August 29, for $1.5 million, the district acquired the land. The final payment of the bond was scheduled for February 1, 2013. Circa 2013 the district was evaluating whether reducing the size of the proposed new building would ultimately save money, or whether it would reduce the amount of grants to the point where such a reduction would not help the district financially. Groundbreaking occurred in August 2014, for the new campus located at Wells Bypass and Ambassador Road on the southwest edge of Mt. Vernon.Centralia Morning Sentinel Tim King, the financial advisor of the district, stated in 2013 that the district was not likely to raise taxes despite the new construction. The former campus permanently closed in June 2016. The current Mt. Vernon THS campus at 11101 Wells Bypass opened August 19, 2016, with a ribbon cutting by Illinois governor Bruce Rauner.

The original plan for the area, from 1649, was later abandoned. It now comprises neighbourhoods and localities such as Frederiksstaden, the Nyboder neighbourhood, Nyhavn, Larsens Plads and Kongens Nytorv. History =Expansion of the fortified city= As part of his aspirations to strengthen Copenhagen as a regional centre, Christian IV decided to expand the area of the fortified city northwards. As early as 1606, when his modernization of the fortifications began, he had purchased 200 hectares of land outside the Eastern City Gate. His intention was to redevelop this area into a new district referred to as Ny K√∏benhavn (English: New Copenhagen) or Sankt Ann√¶ By (Saint Ann's Town). The plan was to change the course of √òstervold, which at that time made a bend and ran along what is today Gothersgade and Kongens Nytorv. The new √òstervold would be a direct extension of N√∏rrevold, connecting it to Sankt Ann√¶ Skanse, thereby increasing the area of the fortified city with approximately 40%. However, the 1630s was a time of economic crisis and both Sankt Ann√¶ Skanse and the new course of √òstervold was delayed with no major work going on during that decade. After both Jutland and Scania had been occupied by enemy forces in the first half of the 1640s and the Kingdom's very existence had been threatened, work on the fortifications was resumed. The new √òstervold was constructed and a new project for the fortress at Sankt Ann√¶ Skanse, with the layout of a bastioned pentagram, was completed in 1661.

The oldest known building on the site was a stave church. In the 1500s, a large addition was added to the south and then later in 1551, a large addition to the north was added, making the church a cruciform design. In the 1820s the church was expanded by constructing a second level gallery for seating. The church was still too small, so in 1858, the building was partially torn down with only the sacristy and choir of the old church remaining. The church was rebuilt the same year with a new timber-framed cruciform design. The new church had a tower on the west end. On 7 April 1929, the church burned down.

An ancient map of Le Cotoy and it fortress can be found in the church along with an altarpiece depicting the life of St. Honor√© who lived in the 15th century as well as ex voto ships.  History  The St Peter's Church was formerly called Notre Dame Church and was the parish church of Le Crotoy. This sailors' chapel, dedicated to St Peter, was located in the St Peter Street in Le Crotoy, on the spot were today the St Peter's church can be found. The old church, like the one in Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, had two parallel aisles and was surrounded by the cemetery. The building was such a dilapidated state that in 1850 the mayor and the priest decided to rebuild it. Both ships were destroyed and only the front tower of the 13th century was preserved. The work was completed in February 1865.  Altarpiece of St. Honor√© Altarpiece in the St Peter's church, Le Crotoy The altarpiece dating back to the end of the 15th century was originally part of the Thuison abbey in Abbeville. During the French revolution in 1789 the altarpiece was sold, just like all other goods of the monastery, and bought by an antique dealer in Abbeville. In 1792 the abbot Delahaye, a refugee at his father in Le Crotoy, noticed the altar and the altarpiece at the antique dealer.

It was also occupied by Hyder Ali, Tipu Sultan and British during various times. The fort was used by the British as a garrison till 1854, after which the fort was not operational. In modern times, the fort is under the control of the Archaeological Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Some portions of the fort is dilapidated, while most other portions are enchroached by slum dwellers. History The Fort was constructed by a local Palaiyakkarar chieftain Gatti Mudaliar dynasty under Madurai Nayaks. Attur fort became part of Mysore Kingdom in late 17th century when frequent wars between Mysore Kingdom and Thirumalai Nayak of Madurai when large parts of north west Tamil region from Dindigul became part of Mysore rulers. The region became part of Mysore Wodeyar rulers and later under Hyder Ali of Mysore till 1768, when surrendered to Wood of East India Company. Hyder Ali regained the town from the British East India Company, but the Company won a decisive victory in the 3rd Mysore war was against Tipu Sultan, the son of Hyder Ali.

Reynolds received his PhD in physics from Princeton in 1943, writing a thesis of the propagation of shock waves. During World War II, he joined the United States Navy, and served with the Manhattan Project. He worked with George Kistiakowsky on the design of the explosive lenses required by the implosion-type nuclear weapon. He was involved in the investigation of the Port Chicago disaster, served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was part of the Manhattan Project team sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to inspect the bomb damage. After the war, Reynolds began a long academic career at Princeton University. He was director of the Princeton's High Energy Physics Program from 1948 until 1970, when he became the first director of Princeton's new Center for Environmental Studies. He combined his interest in the sea and science by working during the summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he studied marine bioluminescence. He also worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Early life George Thomas Reynolds was born in Trenton, New Jersey on May 27, 1917, the son of George W. Reynolds, a trainmaster for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and his wife Laura, a secretary with the New Jersey Department of Geology. Raised in Highland Park, New Jersey from the age of two, he attended Franklin Junior High School in his hometown through tenth grade and then New Brunswick High School. He received a bachelor's degree in physics from Rutgers University in 1939. He then entered Princeton University, where was awarded a master of science degree in 1942. He earned his PhD in 1943 under the supervision of Walker Bleakney, writing his thesis \\"Studies in the production, propagation, and interactions of shock waves\\". Manhattan Project Damage at the Port Chicago Pier after the explosion of July 17, 1944 World War II was raging at this time, and someone with a doctorate in such a topic area was highly sought after by the wartime Manhattan Project, but Reynolds turned down an offer to join it. An avid surf fisherman and sailor, he aspired to join the United States Navy. He attempted to enlist, but was turned down because he wore glasses. He then lobbied the Navy, which waived this requirement. He was then commissioned as an ensign in 1943, and married Virginia Rendall, a librarian, while he waited for his first assignment. Instead of the seafaring assignment he hoped for, Reynolds was sent to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory to assist George Kistiakowsky in the design of the explosive lenses required by the implosion-type nuclear weapon. In April 1944, Kistiakowsky named Reynolds as one of eleven men that he would like to have working for him at Los Alamos. Reynolds was one of the naval officers who was sent to investigate the Port Chicago disaster, in which an ammunition ship had blown up in the harbor. He was tasked with estimating the size of the explosion, based upon observations of the damage. His estimate was ¬± tons. A bill of lading was subsequently found for 1,540 tons, confirming his estimate. Reynolds was one of several researchers who determined that an atomic bomb would do maximum damage if detonated in the air rather than at ground level. He later served with Project Alberta, the part of the Manhattan Project for operations in the field. He served on Tinian, where the worked with the X-Unit Section, which was responsible for the Fat Man bomb's firing unit. He flew a number of practice missions, but not the bombing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. After the fighting ended, he was part of the Manhattan Project team sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to inspect the bomb damage. Princeton After the war, Reynolds accepted an offer of an assistant professorship at Princeton University. He would spend the rest of his career there, being promoted to associate professor in 1951, and then to professor in 1959. John Archibald Wheeler interested him in cosmic rays. Reybolds was director of the Princeton's High Energy Physics Program from 1948 to 1970. He initially recruited Ronald Rau from Caltech and Joseph Ballam from the University of California. Ballam eventually became a professor and division head at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, while Rau went on to become Chairman of the Physics Department at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Reynolds later hired Sam Treiman, Giorgio Salvini, Riccardo Giacconi, Val Fitch and Jim Cronin. His reputation for spotting and hiring talent was assured when Giacconi, Fitch and Cronin won Nobel Prizes. For his cosmic ray research, Reynolds attempted to grow large organic crystal scintillators to use as ionized particle detectors. Scintillators are luminescent materials that, when struck by an incoming particle, absorb its energy and scintillate ‚Äì emit light. They are used in many areas of scientific research. He was frustrated by cracks in the crystals, and attempted to get around the problem by dissolving them in liquid. To the surprise of many, the liquid was just as effective as crystal scintillators. Today, liquid scintillators are in widespread use in nuclear, biological and medical research. He also developed automated X-ray detectors for collecting data on protein structures. Interest in environmental issues increased in the late 1960s, and in 1970, Princeton established Princeton's Center for Environmental Studies. Reynolds was appointed as its first director. Under his leadership, it investigated a number of unusual inter- disciplinary topics, such as energy conservation in buildings, indoor air quality, the relationship between nuclear power and nuclear weapons, and the decision-making process in environmental issues Although most of his career was at Princeton, he spent some time in England, where was a Churchill Fellow at Cambridge University in 1973 and 1974. He was later a visiting Senior Research Fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Oxford University, and a visiting professor at Oxford Research Unit of the Open University, from 1981 to 1982, and a Royal Society Guest Research Fellow at Oxford University in 1985. Reynolds became the Class of 1909 Professor of Physics in 1978, and Professor Emeritus 1987. For 31 years he combined his interest in the sea and science by working during the summer at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he studied marine bioluminescence. He also worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Reynolds died from cancer at his home in the Skillman section of Montgomery Township, New Jersey on April 19, 2005. He was survived by his wife, Virginia, and his four sons, G. Thomas, Richard, Robert and David.

Structure  The UBC has a round or oval cell body with usually a single short dendrite that ends in a brush-like tuft of short dendrioles (dendrites unique to UBCs). These brush dendrioles form very large synaptic junctions. The dendritic brush and the large endings of the axonal branches are involved in the formation of cerebellar glomeruli. The UBC has one short dendrite where the granule cell has four or five. The brush dendrioles emit numerous, thin evaginations called filopodia, unique to UBCs. The filopodia emanate from all over the neuron, even including the dendritic stem and the cell body in some cells. Although UBC filopodia do not bear synaptic junctions, they are nevertheless involved in cell signaling.  Function  UBCs are intrinsically firing neurons and considered as a class of excitatory ‚Äúlocal circuit neurons‚Äù. They work together with vestibular fibres to integrate signals involving the orientation of the head that modulates reflex behaviour. UBCs function to amplify inputs from the vestibular ganglia and nuclei by spreading and prolonging excitation within the granular layer. They receive glutamatergic inputs on its dendritic brush from a single mossy fibre terminal in the form of a giant glutamatergic synapse and make glutamatergic synapses with granule cells and other UBCs.  Location  UBCs are plentiful in those regions linked to vestibular functions. In mammals, UBCs show an uneven distribution within the granule cell domains of the hindbrain, being the most dense in the vermis, part of the flocculus/paraflocculus complex, and layers 2‚Äì4 of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. In the rat cerebellum, UBCs outnumber Golgi cells by a factor of 3 and approximately equal the number of Purkinje cells. Like other glutamatergic cells of the cerebellum, UBCs originate in the rhombic lip.  History  UBCs were first described in 1977 by Altman and Bayer, who called them \\"pale cells\\". The term \\"unipolar brush cell\\" was first introduced in the early 1990s, reclassifying pale cells, Rat-302 cells, monodendritic cells, chestnut cells and mitt cells under the same name. The Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FICAT), which is a subcommittee of the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA), officially recognized the ‚Äúunipolar brush cell‚Äù as a new cell type of the cerebellar cortex in 2008.  Pathological significance  UBCs situated in cerebellar lobule VII are affected in some cases of Pick's disease, where they develop cytoskeletal anomalies and are recognized by antibodies to abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. UBCs have also been implicated in the dysfunction of balance and motor coordination present in Down syndrome.Harashima C, Jacobowitz DM, Stoffel M, et al.

It is the largest marine mammal park in Europe. Visitor numbers were steady from 2005 to 2011, numbering between 700,000 and 800,000, with only the opening of new attractions responsible for a surge in numbers. In 2012 the Dolfinarium made ‚Ç¨12 million in sales, which was around ‚Ç¨2,4 million lower than the year before. This was mainly due to a decline in visitor numbers because of orca Morgan leaving the park, and the park temporarily closing down due to the start of construction at the end of the year. History Dolfinarium in Harderwijk, Netherlands, Dutch newsreel from 1966 In 1955 businessman Frits den Herder together with his brother Coen, the owner of a local shipping company and playground, started collecting sea mammals. They started by building a dolphinarium (in Dutch: dolfinarium). In 1965 the park was opened to the general public. The goal of the park according to Frits was to \\"make the Dutch population show respect for these most special and mythical sea mammals\\". In 1969 the characteristic dome was built, and in the year after opening the Dolfinarium welcomed one million visitors. In the seventies the Dolfinarium expanded its collection of animals and built more enclosures. In 1976 the Icelandic orca Gudrun was added to the collection. At the end of the decade the Dolfinarium started setting up dependencies abroad. As these dependencies did not have financial success, the Dolfinarium went bankrupt in 1982. At the insistence of the mayor of Harderwijk a new foundation was set up to continue the Dolfinarium and in 1984 the shares of the company were sold to a new owner. In 1987 Gudrun was sent to SeaWorld Orlando. In 1989 the Dolfinarium once again changed hands and the new owner invested money in the building of new attractions. The largest of the constructions was the building of a lagoon in 1997, which cost around 12 million euro. In 2001 the Dolfinarium was bought by Compagnie des Alpes, which owns another amusement park in the Netherlands, Walibi Holland, and formerly owned . In 2005 the park underwent major renovation for the fiftieth anniversary of the park. During the boreal winter of 2012-2013, further renovations, including refurbishment of the old dome, were made. On 17 December 2014 the director of the Dolfinarium said that the ownership of the Dolfinarium would likely pass from Compagnie des Alpes to Aspro Parks, with negotiations being in the final stages. In 2016 the Dolfinarium announced to decrease the number of dolphins at the park, citing that the population had gotten too large. It also announced a new playground for children. The number of visitors decreased to 586,300 in 2016. In 2018 the Dolfinarium opened a new attraction and turned a profit for the first time in five years. Areas DolfijndoMijn dome of the Dolfinarium Harderwijk as seen from the outside of the park. Dolphins at the Dolfijnendelta performing in a show. The park is open each year from spring to autumn, with winter being reserved for maintenance. The park is divided into several areas for different species or wider groups of animals. The animals in some areas perform in shows. * Bruinvisbaai: Harbour porpoise * DolfijndoMijn: Main show area for common bottlenose dolphins. Set in the blue dome, which has a capacity of 2000 people. * Dolfijnendelta: Formerly known as the lagoon, this is the living area for common bottlenose dolphins, most dolphins live in this area, including the newborns. The area can also be observed from underwater (at the Onderwater Odiezee), which provides a 60 meter long glass wall, with the dolphins often coming close due to their curious nature. The aquarium holds 15 million liters of water. * Krabbenkust: Crabs, lobsters, sea anemone, fish. * Roggenrif: Rays, Sharks, European seabass, Thicklip grey mullet, other fish, crabs, lobsters, oysters, lugworms and sea anemone. * Stoere Stellerstek: Steller sea lion * Walrussenwal: Walrus, Walrus Igor lived here until he died in 2013. * Zeeleeuwenzee: California sea lion * Zeehondenzand: Harbor seal and Grey seal * Zotte Zeeleeuwentheather: Show area for California sea lions. The park has numerous restaurants, shops and playgrounds and a beach located on lake Wolderwijd. An in-park hotel is planned. =Additional experiences= In cooperation with a foundation, the Dolfinarium offers therapeutic sessions with dolphins for children with autism or Down syndrome. Commercially it offers a program called \\"Sleeping with dolphins\\" for children aged 8‚Äì12. SOS Dolfijn SOS Dolfijn is an independent foundation based in the Dolfinarium dedicated to the saving of stranded porpoises, dolphins and whales. Porpoises (85%) are the most common patients at the recovery facilities in the Dolfinarium. The goal of saved animals is to let them recover and then release them into the wild again. If porpoises are deemed unfit to be released into the wild, they are sent to the Bruinvisbaai or to facilities at Ecomare on the island of Texel. In 2016 the cooperation between SOS Dolfijn and the Dolfinarium stopped, with SOS Dolfijn announcing it was looking for a new location. Morgan In 2010 the Dolfinarium attracted worldwide attention when young killer whale Morgan was found exhausted and emaciated in the North Sea. She was rescued and sent for recovery at the Dolfinarium. After her recuperation opinions were split between those who wanted to return her to nature, and those who saw no chance of Morgan surviving in nature and thus wished her to go Loro Parque, Tenerife, Spain, where she could be better taken care of. The Dolfinarium wished to see Morgan go to the Loro Parque as well. Those who wished to see Morgan return to nature united in the Orca Coalition. Sentiments ran high and in the end a Dutch judge decided that Morgan should be transported to Loro Parque. Morgan was moved to Loro Parque on 29 November 2011. The Dutch police provided an escort from the Dolfinarium to Schiphol Airport. The date of the transport had been kept secret as the city of Harderwijk feared confrontations between opposers of the transport and police. The city had issued an emergency ban on 'Free Morgan' protests. The costs to the Dolfinarium of the rescue, upkeep, and transport of Morgan to Spain were over ‚Ç¨1 million. Television Dutch broadcaster Nickelodeon aired a show intended for children called Spetter! during 2006. The show was based around the dolphin called Spetter in the Dolfinarium. Spetter was the first dolphin born by artificial insemination in the Dolfinarium. While shooting the series, a plastic model of the dolphin was at times used so as to not exhaust the animal. A subsequent season called Spetter and the Romanov Mystery was aired by Jetix in 2007. Tess Gaerth√©, Dutch contestant to the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2005, provided the titlesong for the second season. Re-runs of the Spetter series have been shown by different RTL channels. The airing of the Spetter series led to a higher number of visitors for the Dolfinarium.

His academic work is closely associated with the humanistic, culturally oriented New Musicology, now more often referred to as cultural or critical musicology.Critical Musicological Reflections: Essays in Honour of Derek Scott, ed. Stan Hawkins (Ashgate 2012), 1-18 Writing in 2001, Alastair Williams described Kramer as a pioneering figure in the disciplinary change that brought musicology, formerly an outlier, into the broader fold of the humanities.Dr. Alastair Williams, Constructing Musicology (Ashgate Publishing 2001, p. 121 Biography Kramer was born in Philadelphia and educated at the University of Pennsylvania and Yale. After several years on the English faculty at the University of Pennsylvania, he moved to Fordham University in New York where he has taught since 1978 and now holds the position of Distinguished Professor of English and Music. Prior posts at Fordham include Professor of English and Comparative Literature. He is the author of fourteen books on music and close to a hundred and fifty articles or chapters. Since 1993 he has been editor of the journal 19th-Century Music. He has held ten visiting professorships in North America, Europe, and China. His work has been translated into nine languages. New musicology New and/or Critical musicology rejected the idea of the autonomous musical artwork and sought to understand music in terms of its social and cultural relationships. Controversial when introduced in the late 1980s, this position has since become foundational, while expanding further to include questions of affect, embodiment, and performance. It has also expanded beyond Western classical music, the main focus of Kramer‚Äôs work, to include music in any genre. Kramer‚Äôs Music as Cultural Practice (1990) set forth the principle that music takes on complex meanings as a result of its participation the circulation of valuations and practices that constitute culture. The book introduced a number of terms, including its title phrase, which passed into common use, most prominently ‚Äúhermeneutic windows‚Äù (pressure points in and around music from which multiple lines of cultural associations extend). Between this book and The Thought of Music (2016; part of a trilogy also including Expression and Truth (2012) and Interpreting Music (2010), Kramer expanded his theoretical frame of reference to include performance, embodiment, voice, music in media (especially film), and opera. He has challenged the idea that musical meaning must be derived from musical form and has repeatedly rejected oppositions between score and performance and performance and meaning. He has drawn on speech act theory, deconstruction, Lacanian psychoanalysis, and philosophy, especially by Heidegger and Wittgenstein, to develop a pragmatic theory of interpretation, ‚Äúdescriptive realism,‚Äù which asserts that interpretation is a form of knowledge, not merely opinion, first as applied to music and then applied in general. This in turn became the basis of a wider theory of humanistic knowledge that embraces uncertainty and creativity and takes musical experience as its paradigm. In The Hum of the World: A Philosophy of Listening (2019), Kramer extended this theory to the experience of sound and the relationship of listening to knowledge. Hermeneutics David Beard and Kenneth Gloag credit Kramer with bringing questions about hermeneutic models and processes‚Äîquestions of meaning‚Äîto the forefront of musicology. In this respect they follow Grove Music Online, which credited Kramer with being the first English-language scholar to give musical hermeneutics a firm theoretical basis and a practical means of proceeding. This approach to musical meaning encompasses music with texts as well as instrumental music. According to Steven Paul Scher, writing in 1999, Kramer's development of new critical languages was preeminent in advancing the study of text-music relations.Steven Paul Scher, \\"Melopoetics Revisited,\\" in Word and Music Studies: Defining the Field, ed. Walter Bernhart, Steven Paul Scher, and Werner Wolf (Rospoi 1999), p. 14 David Gramit similarly singled out \\"an extraordinary series of studies\\" by Kramer mapping the intersection of literary theory and music and demystifying aesthetic experience while also upholding its value.David Gramit, \\"The Roaring Lion: Critical Musicology, Aesthetic Experience, and the Music Department,\\" Canadian University Music Review 19 (1998), pp. 21, 25 Compositions Kramer's compositions, including seven string quartets and fifteen song cycles, have been widely performed in the United States and Europe in venues including New York, Santa Fe, Edinburgh, London, Vienna, Stockholm, Graz, Ghent, and Bern. In 2013, his string quartet movement \\"Clouds, Wind, Stars\\" won the Composers Concordance ‚ÄúGenerations‚Äù award. Kramer's compositions include: *\\"Colors of Memory\\" for piano. *\\"Evocations\\" for piano and optional voice. *\\"Three Nocturnes\\" for viola and piano. *\\"Questions of Travel\\" for cello and piano. *\\"Cloud Shadows\\" for violin and piano. *\\"A Short History\\" (of the Twentieth Century)\\" for voice and percussion. *\\"The Wind Shifts\\" for voice and piano. *\\"Pulsation\\" for piano quartet. *\\"Wingspan\\" for string sextet. *\\"The Hourglass\\" for cello and harp. *\\"Part Songs\\" for mixed chorus.

The administrative and research headquarters are located in Trondheim. The company was established on February 1, 2002 by the founders Terje Eidesmo, St√•le Johansen and Svein Ellingsrud. EMGS pioneered marine electromagnetic technology with the first successful application and commercialization of controlled source electro-magnetic surveying technology (CSEM). Marine EM, or CSEM, is an emerging exploration method that uses electromagnetic energy to detect resistive bodies - including hydrocarbon reservoirs - beneath the seabed. The technique used by EMGS was trialled in 1998 using a towed, high-power EM source and a series of seabed receivers, while the founders were working for Statoil. The company acquires 3D electromagnetic and marine magnetotelluric data, which are used to assess formation resistivity before drilling, and interpret and integrate this information with other geodata to aid exploration decision making. 3D EM data is routinely used for lead generation, prospect ranking and volume assessments. Main offices and research department are located in Trondheim, Norway. The company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on March 30, 2007.

It was built by the Great Western Railway in 1910, on the Camerton branch of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway line. Operation The Camerton branch had been built in 1882 from Hallatrow to Camerton, and extended in 1910 through Monkton Combe, where the station and level-crossing were built, to Limpley Stoke railway station, where it joined up with the line from Bath to Bradford-on-Avon railway station. Passenger services started in 1910 and were suspended during the First World War on 22 March 1915; they resumed on 9 July 1923 ( though Midford Halt never reopened) but were withdrawn entirely two years later on 21 September 1925. Passenger services ran five times a day and used GWR steam rail motors, and the station was run by one man who was also responsible for the level crossing, the signals, and maintaining the gardens. After the end of regular passenger services, traffic included coal trains, some goods wagons to the mill, and a special train, with covered wagons for luggage, delivered or collected the boys from Monkton School at the beginning and end of school terms. Closure The goods services between Limpley Stoke and Camerton continued until Camerton Pit, the last working coal mine in the Cam Valley, ended production in 1950 and the line closed on 15 February 1951. In 1952, the station was used as \\"Titfield\\" station in the Ealing comedy film The Titfield Thunderbolt.

Moorea species are normally the main component of the dietary of some sea hares, which concentrate the cyanobacterial metabolites as a mechanism of defense from predators. Therefore, in 2005, hectochlorin was re-isolated from the Thai sea hare Bursatella leachii, along with a new analogue, deacetylhectochlorin.Suntornchashwej, S., Chaichit, N., Isobe, M. & Suwanborirux, K. Hectochlorin and morpholine derivatives from the Thai sea hare, Bursatella leachii. J. Nat. Prod. 68, 951‚Äì955 (2005). Another reisolation of hectochlorin was reported in 2013, from another Moorea producens strain (RS05), isolated from the Red Sea, surprising in a non- tropical environment, as opposed to the other Moorea strains isolated before. The predicted biosynthesis of hectochlorin was published in 2007 and consists in a hybrid NRPS-PKS, with a hexanoic acid as start unit that becomes halogenated twice in the position 5, producing fairly rare gem-dichloro group, that along with two 2,3-dihydroxyisovaleric acid (DHIV) units compose a very interesting bioactive molecule. Biosynthesis The biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) is composed of 8 genes (Figure 1A), of which seven are directly related to the synthesis of the molecule (hctA-B and hctD-H, in green) and one is predicted to encode a transposase (hctC, in yellow), that tends to be related to the mobility of the gene and not the synthesis of molecule features. The cluster is also flanked by other 5 ORF (Open Reading Frames), including 3 hypothetical proteins, a homing endonuclease and a reverse transcriptase of unknown function regarding biosynthesis mechanistic of the molecule. Biosynthesis of hectochlorin starts with hctA (Figure 1A), responsible for the start unit, which has 53% similarity to an Acyl-ACP synthetase in Fischerella and is predicted to generate a hexanoic acid that starts the hectochlorin molecule. This hexanoic acid gets halogenated twice at the fifth carbon by the gene hctB, generating the gem-dichloro group in 5,5-dichlorohexanoic acid. For such, hctB has one halogenation domain in the N-terminus, which is 47% similar to a halogenase at Microcystis aeruginosa and also contains all conserved residues for the binding of Fe2+/2-oxoglutarate co-factor. In the C-terminus, one ACP domain is present and it is fairly homologous to several others ACP domain at cyanobacteria, like Curacin A, Jamaicamide and so on. As mentioned before, hctC is a transposase of unknown function and it is not directly related in the molecule synthesis. Next, this 5,5-dichlorohexanoic acquires one KS extension by hctD. This gene consists of a single KS module with a minimal configuration (KS-AT-CP) plus one KR and cMT, producing a 7,7-dichloro-3-hydroxy-2-methyl-octanoic acid. HctE consists of a bi-modular NRPS, of which the first module incorporates an isovaleric acid and the second module incorporates a heterocyclic cysteine. In the first module, the adenlyation-domain (A domain) has a mutation substituting a conserved aspartate residue (Asp235) that is related to interactions with the amino group of the cognate amino acid, therefore, incorporating isovaleric acid instead an amino acid. This hydroxyl group that substitutes an amino group condensates with the previous carbonyl from the KS extension. The second module has 67% identity to CurF and BarG (from Curacin A and Barbamide BGCs) and is predicted to adenylate and heterocyclize a cysteine, as well as oxidize it by FMN-dependent oxidase present in between adenlyation conserved motifs, catalyzing the formation of a thiazole ring (Figure 1C). HctF gene has remarkable similarity to hctE, although, there are two main differences: the iso-valeric acid incorporated does not condensate by the hydroxyl group that substitute an amino group, instead, it condensates be the hydroxyl group in the side chain created by a P450 oxidation (Figure 1B); hctF has an extra thioesterase domain that converts thioester bond to ester bond and catalyze the attack from the C-terminal free hydroxyl group to this newly formed ester, cyclizing the molecule. The final genes hctG and hctH probably encode two P450 that oxidize the side chain of both isovaleric acids (Figure 1D). Lastly, a post-NRPS modification happens in the free hydroxyl group from the second isovaleric acid, adding an acetyl group. This addition is not predicted in the current biosynthesis, although the absence of this post-NRPS modification would produce the analogue previously mentioned, deacetylhectochlorin. Figure1. A) Predicted biosynthesis of hectochlorin. B) P450 oxidation of side chain. C)Formation of thiazole ring Currently in the MarinLit database, other compounds (besides deacetylhectochlorin and hectochlorin) that contain this fairly unusual gem-dichloro group are lyngbyabellin A-N, 27-deoxylyngbyabellin A and dolabellin, all of those synthesized from Moorea species. Most lyngbyabellins also contain DHIV in their structure, as well as dolabellin. Figure 2 compares the structures of deacetylhectochlorin, hectochlorin, lyngbyabellin B and dolabellin. This figure illustrates the similarities (black) and differences (red) between those compounds compared to deacetylhectochlorin. All of those compounds (but hectochlorin) do not have a proposed biosynthesis published. Figure 2.

This verse addresses the believers, exhorting them to believe, implying multiple stages of belief.  Difference between Muslim and Mu'min / Mu'mina  In Islamic theology, there exists a significant difference between a Muslim and a Mu'min. A Muslim is a person who has come under the arena of Islam and believes its doctrines. A Mumin is a Muslim with higher degree of belief, with his/her heart having the fear of God and always abiding by the teachings of Quran.Thus, every Mumin is a Muslim but not every Muslim is a Mu'min. The following verse makes a distinction between a Muslim and a believer: > (Al-Hujurat ) The Arabs of the desert say, \\"We believe.\\" (tu/minoo) Say > thou: Ye believe not; but rather say, \\"We profess Islam;\\" (aslamna) for the > faith (al-imanu) hath not yet found its way into your hearts.

He was particularly adept at traumatic surgery. Grima was considered to be one of the best surgeons of his time, as he was able to open bladders and remove stones in only two and a half minutes. Biography =Early life= Grima was born in about 1729.Virtual Medical History Museum: PORTRAIT GALLERY: Michel'Angelo Grima at the University of Malta; retrieved September 17, 2013 At age twelve he began his studies about surgery in the Holy Infirmary in Valletta. He continued his medical studies abroad in the University of Pisa and Florence. He obtained a doctorate in medicine and philosophy in 1754. Grima remained in Florence and worked at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. Here he carried out experiments on live dogs, and published his findings in a book entitled Del Nuovo Metodo di Cucire gl'Intestini. Grima left Florence as an approved surgeon in 1758 and, by the permission of the Order arrived in Paris in 1760 and served as a medic with the French troops during the Seven Years' War. Here he wrote his second book about his work on the wounded soldiers, entitled Della Medicina Traumatica. This book was published in 1773. =Return to Malta= Grima returned to Malta in 1763 and was immediately given the post of Chief Surgeon at the Holy Infirmary. Two years later he started lecturing on anatomy and surgery, and became holder of the Chair of Anatomy and Surgery. In 1771 he was nominated as lecturer in surgery and anatomy in two Italian colleges, yet he remained in Malta. Later on in 1781 Grima published a textbook, the Istituzioni d'Anatomia, to complement his lectures. Medical students from all over Europe travelled to Malta to learn under his tutorage. In 1783, Grandmaster Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc commissioned him to test the legitimacy of the remedial measures of Mesmer's method of animal magnetism. Grima retired in 1797 and died on 25 August 1798. He is buried in the Church of the Minor Observants of St. Francis in Valletta.

History The Konak was built in 1891 by Italian architect Vitaliano Poselli. The architect chose eclecticism as the main style for the building, which combines elements of various architectural styles such as neoclassicism. It sits on top of the ruins of the imperial palace of the Byzantine Emperor in Thessaloniki, of which some remnants have been found near the building. When it was completed in the late 1890s, it only had three floors. The fourth floor, in neoclassical style, was added in 1955. In 1907, the building housed the Ottoman School of Law, and in 1911 the Sultan Mehmed V Reshad stayed here during his visit to the city. During the First Balkan War, it was inside this building that the documents of the surrender of Thessaloniki were signed, making Thessaloniki part of the Kingdom of Greece. From 1912 to 1929 the building housed the Governorate-General of Macedonia. During the fire of 1917, the building sustained no damage, despite widespread devastation in the area, which destroyed much of the old city centre.

Professional career During her long career in the Reserve Bank, Subramaniam worked as Regional Director of RBI Bhopal, and Chief General Manager of the important Departments of Banking Supervision (DBS) and Non- Banking Supervision (DNBS) at Mumbai. She also excelled as an academician in the field of banking and finance, having donned the chair of Principal of Reserve Bank Staff College, Chennai and Vice Principal of Bankers' Training College, Mumbai. She is widely respected for her erudition in the field of financial regulation. Throughout her career she had the reputation of being an honest and upright officer, who never compromised with principles of ethics. It is alleged that, she was framed in the scam by unscrupulous colleagues who were miffed with her strictness at workplace. The Scandal On 18 December 2003, Reserve Bank of India was rocked by one of the most sensational frauds in its history, when Uma Subramaniam, the then Regional Director of RBI, Bhopal, received a call from a person claiming to be a relative of the Governor Dr Y V Reddy, who \\"badly needed Rs 20 lakh in cash\\". Without verifying the identity of the caller, Uma Subramaniam arranged the money by asking her employees to immediately withdraw their cash. Subramaniam herself went in an autorickshaw and handed over the cash to the unknown person, who quietly walked away. Later it was discovered that the \\"Governor's relative\\" was an impostor. However, the identity of the impostor was never revealed and the case still remains a mystery. Subsequent controversy Subramaniam was charge-sheeted following a departmental enquiry and was demoted from CGM rank to GM due to her gross negligence of duty. But subsequently she found favour with the RBI Top Management and was not only reinstated to her earlier position, but also given important portfolios like supervision and regulation of commercial banks and NBFCs. Her career was revived by the then Deputy Governor of RBI Shyamala Gopinath and she got promoted in 2007.

In antiquity, the Greek philosopher Pyrrho traveled with Alexander the Great's army on its conquest of India (327 to 325 BCE) and based his philosophy of Pyrrhonism on what he learned there.Diogenes La√´rtius Lives of the Eminent Philosophers Book IX, Chapter 9, Section 69 Christopher I. Beckwith has identified a translation of the Buddhist three marks of existence, in Pyrrho's teachings. In the modern era, a few European thinkers such as Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche engaged with Buddhist thought. Likewise, in Asian nations with Buddhist populations, there were also attempts to bring the insights of Western thought to Buddhist philosophy, as can be seen in the rise of Buddhist modernism. After WWII spread of Buddhism to the West scholarly interest arose in a comparative, cross-cultural approach between Eastern and Western philosophy. Much of this work is now published in academic journals such as Philosophy East and West. Hellenistic philosophy According to Edward Conze, Pyrrhonism has similarities with Buddhist philosophy, especially the Indian Madhyamika school.Conze, Edward. Buddhist Philosophy and Its European Parallels . Philosophy East and West 13, p.9-23, no.1, January 1963. University Press of Hawaii. The Pyrrhonist goal of ataraxia (the state of being untroubled) is a soteriological goal similar to nirvana. The Pyrrhonists promoted suspending judgment (epoch√©) about dogma (beliefs about non-evident matters) as the way to reach ataraxia. This is similar to the Buddha's refusal to answer certain metaphysical questions which he saw as non-conductive to the path of Buddhist practice and Nagarjuna's \\"relinquishing of all views (drsti)\\". Pyrrho taught that things are 'adiaphora' (undifferentiated by logical differentia), 'astathmƒìta' (unstable, unbalanced, not measurable), and 'anepikrita' (unjudged, unfixed, undecidable). This is strikingly similar to the Buddhist Three marks of existence. Adrian Kuzminski argues for direct influence between these two systems of thought. In Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism, Kuzminski writes: \\"its origin can plausibly be traced to the contacts between Pyrrho and the sages he encountered in India, where he traveled with Alexander the Great.\\"Kuzminski, Pyrrhonism How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism; for a recent study see Halkias \\"The Self-immolation of Kalanos and other Luminous Encounters among Greeks and Indian Buddhists in the Hellenistic World\\" Jocbs. 2015 (8): 163‚Äì186. https://www.academia.edu/12679460/The_Self- immolation_of_Kalanos_and_other_Luminous_Encounters_Among_Greeks_and_Indian_Buddhists_in_the_Hellenistic_World According to Kuzminski, both philosophies argue against assenting to any dogmatic assertions about an ultimate metaphysical reality behind our sense impressions as a tactic to reach tranquility and both also make use of logical arguments against other philosophies in order to expose their contradictions. Hume and Not-Self The Scottish philosopher David Hume wrote: > \\"When I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on > some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love > or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never catch myself at any time without a > perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception\\"Hume, David. > A Treatise of Human Nature, Book I Part IV Section VI: Of Personal Identity According to Hume then there is nothing that is constantly stable which we could identify as the self, only a flow of differing experiences. Our view that there is something substantive which binds all of these experiences together is for Hume merely imaginary. The self is a fiction that is attributed to the entire flow of experiences.Giles, James. The No-Self Theory: Hume, Buddhism, and Personal Identity, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 43, No. 2 (Apr., 1993), pp. 175-200, University of Hawai'i Press. > Pain and pleasure, grief and joy, passions and sensations succeed each > other, and never all exist at the same time. It cannot, therefore, be from > any of these impressions, or from any other, that the idea of self is > deriv'd; and consequently there is no such idea...I may venture to affirm of > the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of > different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable > rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement. This 'Bundle theory' of personal identity is very similar to the Buddhist notion of not-self, which holds that the unitary self is a fiction and that nothing exists but a collection of five aggregates.Gopnik, Alison. Could David Hume Have Known about Buddhism? Charles Francois Dolu, the Royal College of La Fl√®che, and the Global Jesuit Intellectual Network. Hume Studies, Volume 35, Number 1&2, 2009, pp. 5‚Äì28. Similarly, both Hume and Buddhist philosophy hold that it is perfectly acceptable to speak of personal identity in a mundane and conventional way, while believing that there are ultimately no such things. Hume scholar Alison Gopnik has even argued that Hume could have had contact with Buddhist philosophy during his stay in France (which coincided with his writing of the Treatise of Human Nature) through the well traveled Jesuit missionaries of the Royal College of La Fl√®che. British philosopher Derek Parfit has argued for a reductionist and deflationary theory of personal identity in his book Reasons and Persons. According to Parfit, apart from a causally connected stream of mental and physical events, there are no ‚Äúseparately existing entities, distinct from our brains and bodies‚Äù. Parfit concludes that \\"Buddha would have agreed.\\"Parfit, Reasons and Persons 1984, p 273 Parfit also argues that this view is liberating and leads to increased empathy. > Is the truth depressing? Some may find it so. But I find it liberating, and > consoling. When I believed that my existence was such a further fact, I > seemed imprisoned in myself. My life seemed like a glass tunnel, through > which I was moving faster every year, and at the end of which there was > darkness. When I changed my view, the walls of my glass tunnel disappeared. > I now live in the open air. There is still a difference between my lives and > the lives of other people. But the difference is less. Other people are > closer. I am less concerned about the rest of my own life, and more > concerned about the lives of others.Parfit, Reasons and Persons 1984, pp. > 280-81 According to The New Yorker's Larissa MacFarquhar, passages of Reasons and Persons have been studied and chanted at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery.MacFarquhar, Larissa. HOW TO BE GOOD, An Oxford philosopher thinks he can distill all morality into a formula. Is he right? 2011 Other Western philosophers that have attacked the view of a fixed self include Daniel Dennett (in his paper 'The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity') and Thomas Metzinger ('The Ego Tunnel'). Idealism Idealism is the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. Some Buddhist philosophical views have been interpreted as having Idealistic tendencies, mainly the cittamatra (mind-only) philosophy of Yogacara BuddhismTola & Dragonetti, Philosophy of mind in the Yogacara Buddhist idealistic school, History of Psychiatry, 16(4): 453‚Äì465. as outlined in the works of Vasubandhu and Xuanzang.Butler, Sean. Idealism in YogƒÅcƒÅra Buddhism, The Hilltop Review, Western Michigan University. Metaphysical Idealism has been the orthodox position of the Chinese Yogacara school or F«éxi√†ng- z≈çng.Chan, Wing-cheuk, Yogacara Buddhism and Sartre‚Äôs Phenomenology. According to Buddhist philosopher Vasubhandu \\"The transformation of consciousness is imagination. What is imagined by it does not exist. Therefore everything is representation-only.\\" This has been compared to the Idealist philosophies of Bishop Berkeley and Immanuel Kant. Kant's categories have also been compared to the Yogacara concept of karmic vasanas (perfumings) which condition our mental reality. =Buddhism and German Idealism= Schopenhauer in 1815. Immanuel Kant's Transcendental Idealism has also been compared with the Indian philosophical approach of the Madhyamaka school by scholars such as T. R. V. Murti.T. R. V. Murti, The Central Philosophy of Buddhism Both posit that the world of experience is in one sense a mere fabrication of our senses and mental faculties. For Kant and the Madhyamikas, we do not have access to 'things in themselves' because they are always filtered by our mind's 'interpretative framework'.Burton, David. Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study, 107. Thus both worldviews posit that there is an ultimate reality and that Reason is unable to reach it. Buddhologists like Edward Conze have also seen similarities between Kant's antinomies and the unanswerable questions of the Buddha in that \\"they are both concerned with whether the world is finite or infinite, etc., and in that they are both left undecided.\\"Conze, Edward. Spurious Parallels to Buddhist Philosophy , Philosophy East and West 13, no.2, pp105-115 January 1963. Arthur Schopenhauer was influenced by Indian religious texts and later claimed that Buddhism was the \\"best of all possible religions.\\"Urs App, Richard Wagner and Buddhism, pg 17 Schopenhauer's view that \\"suffering is the direct and immediate object of life\\"Schopenhauer, On the Sufferings of the world and that this is driven by a \\"restless willing and striving\\" are similar to the four noble truths of the Buddha.oregonstate.edu page on Schopenhauer & Buddhism http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Schopenhauer/schopenhauer.html Schopenhauer promoted the saintly ascetic life of the Indian sramanas as a way to renounce the Will.Wicks, Robert, \\"Arthur Schopenhauer\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = His view that a single world-essence (The Will) comes to manifest itself as a multiplicity of individual things (principium individuationis) has been compared to the Buddhist trikaya doctrine as developed in Yogacara Buddhism. Finally, Schopenhauer's ethics which are based on universal compassion for the suffering of others can be compared to the Buddhist ethics of Karu·πáƒÅ.Hutton, Kenneth Compassion in Schopenhauer and ≈öƒÅntideva. Journal of Buddhist Ethics Vol. 21 (2014) and (2009) Ethics in Schopenhauer and Buddhism. PhD thesis, University of Glasgow http://theses.gla.ac.uk/912/. Nietzsche Friedrich Nietzsche admired Buddhism, writing that: \\"Buddhism already has - and this distinguishes it profoundly from Christianity - the self-deception of moral concepts behind it - it stands, in my language, Beyond Good and Evil.\\"Nietzsche, The Anti-Christ, R. J. Hollingdale (Trans and Ed.) (Harmondsworth: Penguin), No. 20, p.129. Nietzsche saw himself as undertaking a similar project to the Buddha. ‚ÄúI could become the Buddha of Europe,‚Äù he wrote in 1883, ‚Äúthough frankly I would be the antipode of the Indian Buddha.‚ÄùPana√Øoti, Antoine; Nietzsche and Buddhist Philosophy, p 2 Nietzsche (as well as Buddha) accepted that all is change and becoming, and both sought to create an ethics which was not based on a God or an Absolutist Being.Pana√Øoti, Antoine; Nietzsche and Buddhist Philosophy, p 3 Nietzsche believed that Buddhism's goal of Nirvana was a form of life denying nihilism and promoted what he saw as its inversion, life affirmation and amor fati. According to Benjamin A. Elman, Nietzsche's interpretation of Buddhism as pessimistic and life-denying was probably influenced by his understanding of Schopenhauer's views of eastern philosophy and therefore \\"he was predisposed to react to Buddhism in terms of his close reading of Schopenhauer.\\"Elman, Benjamin A. Nietzsche and Buddhism, Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 44, No. 4. (Oct. - Dec., 1983), pp. 671-686. Because of this writes Elman, Nietzsche misinterprets Buddhism as promoting \\"nothingness\\" and nihilism, all of which the Buddha and other Buddhist philosophers such as Nagarjuna repudiated, in favor of a subtler understanding of Shunyata. Antoine Pana√Øoti argues in Nietzsche and Buddhist philosophy that both of these systems of thought begin by wrestling with the problem of nihilism and that they both develop a therapeutic outlook for dealing with the suffering and anxiety brought about by the crisis of nihilism. While Nietzsche and Buddhism do diverge in some ways, which is why Nietzsche saw himself as an 'Anti-Buddha\\", Pana√Øoti stresses the similarity of both systems as paths towards a ‚Äúvision of great health‚Äù that allows one to deal with the impermanent world of becoming by accepting it as it truly is.Pana√Øoti, Antoine; Nietzsche and Buddhist Philosophy, p 49 Ultimately both world views have as their ideal what Pana√Øoti calls \\"great health perfectionism\\" which seeks to remove unhealthy tendencies from human beings and reach an exceptional state of self-development. Robert G. Morrison has also written on the \\"ironic affinities\\" between Nietzsche and Pali Buddhism through close textual comparison, such as that between Nietzsche's 'self-overcoming' (Selbst√ºberwindung) and the Buddhist concept of mental development (citta-bhavana).MORRISON, ROBERT G. Nietzsche and Buddhism: A Study in Nihilism and Ironic Affinities. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997 Morrison also sees an affinity between the Buddhist concept of tanha, or craving and Nietzsche's view of the will to power as well as in their understandings of personality as a flux of different psycho-physical forces.Morrison, Robert G. Nietzsche and Buddhism: A Study in Nihilism and Ironic Affinities; Reviewed by Loy, David R. Asian Philosophy Vol. 8, No. 2 (July 1998) pp. 129-131 Copyright 1998 Journals Oxford Ltd. (UK), http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-EPT/loy.htm The similarity between Nietzsche's view of the Ego as flux and the Buddhist concept of anatta is also noted by Benjamin Elman. David Loy also quotes Nietzsche's views on the subject as \\"something added and invented and projected behind what there is\\" (Will to Power 481) and on substance (\\"The properties of a thing are effects on other 'things' ... there is no 'thing-in-itself.'\\" WP 557), which are similar to Buddhist nominalist views. Loy however sees Nietzsche as failing to understand that his promotion of heroic aristocratic values and affirmation of will to power is just as much of a reaction to the 'sense of lack' which arises from the impermanence of the subject as what he calls slave morality.Loy, David; Beyond good and evil? A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche. Asian Philosophy Vol. 6, No. 1 (March, 1996) pp. 37-58, http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/loy1.htm Comparative work has also been done by Japanese interpreters of Nietzsche and Buddhism, such as Nishitani Keiji, in his The Self Overcoming Nihilism (Albany, N.Y., 1990), and Abe Masao in his essays on Nietzsche. In his \\"The History of Western Philosophy\\", Bertrand Russell pitted Nietzsche against the Buddha, ultimately criticizing Nietzsche for his promotion of violence, elitism and hatred of compassionate love. Phenomenology and Existentialism √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera developed an interpretation of the Pali Canon influenced by Phenomenology and Existentialism. The German Buddhist monk Nyanaponika Thera wrote that the Buddhist Abhidhamma philosophy \\"doubtlessly belongs\\" to Phenomenology and that the Buddhist term dhamma could be rendered as \\"phenomenon\\".Nyanaponika Thera, Abhidhamma studies, p20. Likewise, Alexander Piatigorsky sees early Buddhist Abhidhamma philosophy as being a \\"phenomenological approach\\".A. Piatigorsky The Buddhist philosophy of thought. ‚Äî Totowa, N. J., 1984 According to Dan Lusthaus, Buddhism \\"is a type of phenomenology; Yogacara even moreso.\\"Dan Lusthaus. Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun. Curzon Critical Studies in Buddhism Series. London: Routledge, 2002. Page viii Some scholars reject the idealist interpretation of Yogacara Buddhist philosophy and instead interpret it through the lens of Western Phenomenology which is the study of conscious processes from the subjective point of view.Sharf, R.H. Is YogƒÅcƒÅra Phenomenology? Some Evidence from the Cheng weishi lun, Indian Philos (2016) 44: 777. doi:10.1007/s10781-015-9282-7 Christian Coseru argues in his monograph \\"Perceiving reality\\" that Buddhist philosophers such as Dharmakirti, ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita and Kamala≈õƒ´la \\"share a common ground with phenomenologists in the tradition of Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.\\" That common ground is the notion of the intentionality of consciousness.Coseru, Christian; Perceiving Reality: Consciousness, Intentionality, and Cognition in Buddhist Philosophyu Coseru compares the concepts of the object aspect (grƒÅhyƒÅkƒÅra) and the subject aspect (grƒÅhakƒÅkƒÅra) of consciousness to the Husserlian concepts of Noesis and Noema. Modern Buddhist thinkers who have been influenced by Western Phenomenology and Existentialism include √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera, Nanamoli Bhikkhu, R. G. de S. Wettimuny, Samanera Bodhesako and Ninoslav √ëƒÅ·πáamoli. =Husserl= Husserl c. 1910s Edmund Husserl, the founder of Phenomenology, wrote that \\"I could not tear myself away\\" while reading the Buddhist Sutta Pitaka in the German translation of Karl Eugen Neumann.Hanna, Fred; Husserl on the Teachings of the Buddha; in The Humanistic Psychologist 23(3):365-372 ¬∑ September 1995.Lau Kwok Ying, Husserl, Buddhism and the problematic crisis of the European sciences; http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/rih/phs/events/200405_PEACE/papers/LAUKwokYing.PDF Husserl held that the Buddha's method as he understood it was very similar to his own. Eugen Fink, who was Husserl's chief assistant and whom Husserl considered to be his most trusted interpreter said that: \\"the various phases of Buddhistic self-discipline were essentially phases of phenomenological reduction.\\"Cairns, D. Conversations with Husserl and Fink, p. 50; The Hague: Nijhoff. After reading the Buddhist texts, Husserl wrote a short essay entitled 'On the discourses of Gautama Buddha' (√úber die Reden Gotomo Buddhos) which states: > Complete linguistic analysis of the Buddhist canonical writings provides us > with a perfect opportunity of becoming acquainted with this means of seeing > the world which is completely opposite of our European manner of > observation, of setting ourselves in its perspective, and of making its > dynamic results truly comprehensive through experience and understanding. > For us, for anyone, who lives in this time of the collapse of our own > exploited, decadent culture and has had a look around to see where spiritual > purity and truth, where joyous mastery of the world manifests itself, this > manner of seeing means a great adventure. That Buddhism - insofar as it > speaks to us from pure original sources - is a religio-ethical discipline > for spiritual purification and fulfillment of the highest stature - > conceived of and dedicated to an inner result of a vigorous and > unparalleled, elevated frame of mind, will soon become clear to every reader > who devotes themselves to the work. Buddhism is comparable only with the > highest form of the philosophy and religious spirit of our European culture. > It is now our task to utilize this (to us) completely new Indian spiritual > discipline which has been revitalized and strengthened by the contrast. Fred J Hanna and Lau Kwok Ying both note that when Husserl calls Buddhism \\"transcendental\\" he is placing it on the same level as his own transcendental phenomenology. Also, that Husserl called Buddhism a \\"great adventure\\" is significant, since he referred to his own philosophy in that way as well - as a methodology which changes the way one views reality which also brings about personal transformation. Husserl also wrote about Buddhist philosophy in an unpublished manuscript \\"Sokrates - Buddha\\" in which he compared the Buddhist philosophical attitude with the Western tradition. Husserl saw a similarity between the Socratic good life lived under the maxim \\"Know yourself\\" and the Buddhist philosophy, he argues that they both have the same attitude, which is a combination of the pure theoretical attitude of the sciences and the pragmatic attitudes of everyday life. This third attitude is based on \\"a praxis whose aim is to elevate humankind through universal scientific reason.\\" Husserl also saw a similarity between Buddhist analysis of experience and his own method of epoche which is a suspension of judgment about metaphysical assumptions and presuppositions about the 'external' world (assumptions he termed 'the naturalistic attitude). However Husserl also thought that Buddhism has not developed into a unifying science which can unite all knowledge since it remains a religious-ethical system and hence it is not able to qualify as a full transcendental phenomenology. According to Aaron Prosser, \\"The phenomenological investigations of Siddhartha Gautama and Edmund Husserl arrive at the exact same conclusion concerning a fundamental and invariant structure of consciousness. Namely, that object-directed consciousness has a transcendental correlational intentional structure, and that this is fundamental -- in the sense of basic and necessary--to all object-directed experiences.\\"Prosser, Aaron; Siddhartha, Husserl, and Neurophenomenology, Journal of Consciousness Studies, Volume 20, Numbers 5-6, 2013, pp. 151-170(20) =Heidegger= According to Reinhard May and Graham Parkes, Heidegger may have been influenced by Zen and Daoist texts.Parkes, Graham. Heidegger and Asian ThoughtMay, Reinhard, Heidegger's Hidden Sources: East- Asian Influences on his Work Some of Martin Heidegger's philosophical terms, such as Ab-grund (void), Das Nichts (the Nothing) and Dasein have been considered in light of Buddhist terms which express similar ideas such as Emptiness.Rolf von Eckartsberg and Ronald S. Valle, Heideggerian Thinking and the Eastern Mind.Wing-cheuk Chan, HEIDEGGER AND CHINESE BUDDHISM Heidegger wrote that: ‚ÄúAs void [Ab-grund], Being ‚Äòis‚Äô at once the nothing [das Nichts] as well as the ground.‚ÄùBackman, Jussi. THE ABSENT FOUNDATION HEIDEGGER ON THE RATIONALITY OF BEING. Heidegger's \\"Dialogue on Language\\", has a Japanese friend (Tezuka Tomio) state that \\"to us [Japanese] emptiness is the loftiest name for what you mean to say with the word ‚ÄòBeing‚Äô‚ÄùStorey, David ‚ÄúZen in Heidegger‚Äôs Way‚Äù, Journal of East-West philosophy. Heidegger's critique of metaphysics has also been compared to Zen's radical anti-metaphysical attitude. William Barrett held that Heidegger's philosophy was similar to Zen Buddhism and that Heidegger himself had confirmed this after reading the works of DT Suzuki. =Existentialism= Jean-Paul Sartre believed that consciousness lacks an essence or any fixed characteristics and that insight into this caused a strong sense of Existential angst or Nausea. Sartre saw consciousness as defined by its ability of negation, this happens because whenever consciousness becomes conscious of something it is aware of itself not being that intentional object. Consciousness is nothingness because all being-in-itself - the entire world of objects - is outside of it.Phra Medidhammaporn (Prayoon Mererk): Sartre‚Äôs Existentialism and Early Buddhism. Publisher: Buddhadhamma Foundation. Furthermore, for Sartre, being-in-itself is also nothing more than appearance, it has no essence.H. Lee, Sander. Notions of Selflessness in Sartrean Existentialism and Theravadin Buddhism. http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Reli/ReliLee.htm This conception of the self as nothingness and of reality as lacking any inherent essence has been compared to the Buddhist concept of Emptiness and Not-self.Steven William Laycock, Nothingness and Emptiness: A Buddhist Engagement With the Ontology of Jean- Paul SartreGokhale,Sarah. Empty Selves: A Comparative Analysis of Mahayana Buddhism, Jean-Paul Sartre‚Äôs Existentialism, and Depth Psychology. Just like the Buddhists rejected the Hindu concept of Atman, Sartre rejected Husserl's concept of the transcendental ego. Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology has been said to be similar to Zen Buddhism and Madhyamaka in that they all hold to the interconnection of the self, body and the world (the \\"lifeworld\\"). The unity of body and mind (shƒìnxƒ´n, Ë∫´ÂøÉ) expressed by the Buddhism of Dogen and Zhanran and Merleau-Ponty's view of the corporeity of consciousness seem to be in agreement. They both hold that the conscious mind is inherently connected to the body and the external world and that the lifeworld is experienced dynamically through the body, denying any independent Cartesian Cogito.Jin Y. Park, Gereon Kopf (editors). Merleau-Ponty and Buddhism, pg 4, pg84. The German existentialist Karl Jaspers also wrote on the philosophy of the Buddha in his \\"The Great Philosophers\\" (1975). He recommended that Western Christians could learn from the Buddha, praised his cosmopolitanism and the flexibility and relatively non-dogmatic worldview of Buddhism.Helmut Wautischer, Alan M. Olson, Gregory J. Walters; Philosophical Faith and the Future of Humanity, p 415-417 Kyoto School Kitaro Nishida, Feb. 1943 The Kyoto School was a Japanese philosophical movement centered around Kyoto University that assimilated western philosophical influences (such as Kant and Heidegger) and Mahayana Buddhist ideas to create a new original philosophical synthesis.Davis, Bret W., \\"The Kyoto School\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = . Its founder, Nishida Kitaro (1870‚Äì1945) developed the central concept associated with the Kyoto school, that is the concept of ‚ÄúAbsolute Nothingness‚Äù (zettai-mu) which is related to the Zen Buddhist term Mu (ÁÑ°) as well as Shunyata. Nishida saw the Absolute nature of reality as Nothingness, a \\"formless\\", \\"groundless ground\\" which envelops all beings and allows them to undergo change and pass away. Buddhism and Process philosophy The process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead has several convergent points with Buddhist philosophy.Inada, Kenneth K. The metaphysics of Buddhist experience and the Whiteheadian encounter, Philosophy East and West Vol. 25/1975.10. P.465-487 http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/inada3.htm Whitehead saw reality as an impermanent constant process of flux and denied that objects had any real substance within them, but rather were ever changing occasions. This is similar to the Buddhist concepts of the impermanence and emptiness.McFarlane, Thomas J. Process and Emptiness: A Comparison of Whitehead‚Äôs Process Philosophy and Mahayana Buddhist Philosophy. Whitehead also held that each one of these processes was never independent, but was interrelated and dependent all prior occasions, and this feature of reality which he called 'creativity' has been compared to dependent origination which holds that all events are conditioned by multiple past causes. Like Buddhism, Whitehead also held that our understanding of the world is usually mistaken because we hold to the ‚Äòfallacy of misplaced concreteness‚Äô in seeing constantly changing processes as having fixed substances. Buddhism teaches that suffering and stress arises from our ignorance to the true nature of the world. Likewise, Whitehead held that the world is \\"haunted by terror\\" at this process of change. \\"The ultimate evil in the temporal world...lies in the fact that the past fades, that time is a ‚Äòperpetual perishing‚Äô\\" (PR, p. 340). In this sense, Whitehead's concept of \\"evil\\" is similar to the Buddhist viparinama-dukkha, suffering caused by change. Whitehead also had a view of God which has been likened to the Mahayana theory of the Trikaya as well as the Bodhisattva ideal. Panpsychism and Buddha-nature Panpsychism is the view that mind or soul is a universal feature of all things; this has been a common view in western philosophy going back to the Presocratics and Plato. According to D. S. Clarke, panpsychist and panexperientialist aspects can be found in the Huayan and Tiantai (Jpn. Tendai) Buddhist doctrines of Buddha nature, which was often attributed to inanimate objects such as lotus flowers and mountains.Clarke, D.S. Panpsychism: past and recent selected readings, pg 39. Wittgenstein Ludwig Wittgenstein held a therapeutic view of philosophy which according to K.T. Fann has \\"striking resemblances\\" to the Zen Buddhist conception of the dharma as a medicine for abstract linguistic and philosophical confusion.K. T. Fann, Wittgenstein's Conception of Philosophy, pg110 C. Gudmunsen in his Wittgenstein and Buddhism argues that \\"much of what the later Wittgenstein had to say was anticipated about 1,800 years ago in India.\\" In his book, Gudmunsen mainly compares Wittgenstein's later philosophy with Madhyamaka views on the emptiness of thought and words.Gudmunsen, Chris Wittgenstein and Buddhism, 1977, p. 113. One of Wittgenstein's students, the Sri Lankan philosopher KN Jayatilleke, wrote Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge which interpreted the epistemology of the early Buddhist texts analytically. Many modern interpreters of Nagarjuna (Jay Garfield, CW Huntington) take a Wittgensteinian or Post-Wittgensteinian critical model in their work on Madhyamaka Buddhist philosophy.Rosenquist, Tina. Demystifying the saint, Jay L Garfield's rational reconstruction of Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka as the epitome of cross-cultural philosophy. Ives Waldo writes that Nagarjuna's criticism of the idea of svabhava (own-being) \\"directly parallels Wittgenstein's argument that a private language (an empiricist language) is impossible. Having no logical links (criteria) to anything outside their defining situation, its words must be empty of significance or use.\\"Ives Waldo, \\"Naagaarjuna and Analytic Philosophy, \\"Philosophy East and West 25, no. 3 (July p. 169 1975): 281-290.

Hall and in self-published works as Pat Hall), was a British ornithologist, associated with the Natural History Museum. She is best known for her work on African birds. She also wrote a book of whimsical poems with Derek Goodwin called the Bird Room Ballads (1969). Pat grew up in Epson, Surrey, born in an upper-middle-class family. Her ambition was to study mathematics at Cambridge but she failed to pursue it due to opposition from her parents. Forced to spend several years at home, she took to watching birds and then decided to sign up for the Women's Legion in 1939. Her work involved teaching ambulance driving and precautions during Air Raids. She got engaged to John Hall, a lieutenant in the army who was posted in the Middle East. She was initially posted to South Africa and she transferred to Egypt in March 1941 allowing her to marry John. After the war she returned to the UK and in 1947, following a failed marriage, she took up a position as a scientific associate at the bird room of the Natural History Museum. She obtained the job after meeting Sir Norman Kinnear who was a friend of her cousin Alfred Hughes.Goodwin, D & Pat Hall (1969) Bird Room Ballads. Introduction. She then joined an expedition to southern and south-western Africa in 1949 along with James Macdonald and Colonel F. O. Cave. Working for half a year, they collected 1300 specimens of nearly 200 species of bird. She went on several self-funded expeditions in 1953 to northern Bechuanaland and another to Angola in 1957. She led the Harold Hall expedition to Australia based on her experience in arid zones in 1965. She worked on a number of African bird groups including the francolins. Her major work was An Atlas of Speciation in African Passerine Birds (1970) in collaboration with R.E. Moreau. She also wrote two books based on her war years in Africa What a Way to Win a War (1978) and A Hawk from a Handsaw (1993). Along with Derek Goodwin, she also wrote a series of whimsical poems Bird Room Ballads which were based on their activities in the bird section of the British Museum. Pat was a member of the Committee of the British Ornithologists‚Äô Club from 1955 to 1964 and an Assistant Editor of the Ibis from 1971 to 1973. She received the Gill Memorial Medal and the Stamford Raffles Award in 1971 as well as a BOU medal in 1973. She was invited to preside over the 4th Pan African Ornithological Congress in 1976.

He first appears in the album Cigars of the Pharaoh (1934) and is a criminal mastermind with multiple identities, whose activities frequently bring him in conflict with his archenemy Tintin. Character history =Early development= A visual prototype for Rastapopoulos appears in Tintin in America, where he is among the assembled dignitaries at a Chicago banquet held in Tintin's honour. Here he is seated next to the actress Mary Pikefort, an allusion to the real-life actress Mary Pickford. Michael Farr asserted that this was indeed a depiction of Rastapopoulos, and that it would be expected for a film director to be seated next to a Hollywood actress. The name \\"Rastapopoulos\\" had been invented by one of Herg√©'s friends; Herg√© thought it was hilarious and decided to use it. He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian-American with a Greek surname, but the character fitted anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews; Herg√© was adamant that the character was not Jewish. The prototype for Rastapopoulos in Tintin in America, seated next to Mary Pikefort. Herg√© first introduced the character of Rastapopoulos in Cigars of the Pharaoh, which was serialised in Le Petit Vingti√®me from 8 December 1932 to 8 February 1934. Tintin runs into him at the start of the adventure aboard the M.S. Isis, a cruise ship docking at Egypt. Here, the Egyptologist Sophocles Sarcophagus bumps into Rastapopoulos, and Rastapopoulos threatens to beat him until Tintin intervenes. He then shouts at Tintin, accusing him of being an \\"Impudent whipper-snapper!\\" Tintin recognises Rastapopoulos, commenting that he is \\"the millionaire film tycoon, king of Cosmos Pictures... And it's not the first time we've met...\\" Later in the story, Tintin runs into Rastapopoulos again, this time running into his desert film set, interrupting an apparent assault on a young woman before realizing that it was only part of the film. Although many of the actors are annoyed, Rastapopoulos is affable, and invites Tintin into his tent where, over a pot of Turkish coffee, Tintin informs him of everything that has happened to him since leaving the cruise ship, Rastapoloulos subsequently providing him with clothes and directions to another village. Farr noted that this idea of the hero mistakenly trusting the villain was one that had been used by John Buchan and Alfred Hitchcock, the latter of whom was an influence on Herg√©. Rastapopoulos reappears‚Äî this time disguised in a trench-coat and hat‚Äî at the end of the story, where he and a fakir kidnap the crown prince of Gaipajama in vengeance for the Maharajah's war against the opium trade. Tintin pursues them, and a car chase ensues, before Tintin encounters the still-disguised Rastapopoulos on a rocky mountainside, with the criminal boss apparently falling to his death when the cliff-ledge he is on breaks under his foot. Herg√© reintroduced Rastapopoulos in the following adventure, The Blue Lotus, which was set in China and dealt with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. In one scene, Tintin hides in a Shanghai cinema that is screening The Sheik's House, Rastapopoulos' film that Tintin witnessed being filmed in the preceding story, later learning that Rastapopoulos, currently staying in the city, was the last person to see a famous doctor who Tintin believes could cure the dangerous poison of madness (Although he accepts Rastapopoulos' story that he dropped the doctor off at his house after a party). At the end of The Blue Lotus, Rastapopoulos is exposed as the leader of the international opium smuggling organisation that Tintin had previously battled in Cigars of the Pharaoh, and is subsequently imprisoned. =Later appearances= Rastapopoulos subsequently resurfaces in the guise of the Marquis di Gorgonzola, a millionaire magnate and slave trader in The Red Sea Sharks, having been forced to assume a new identity after he was arrested for his previous crimes. When Tintin, Haddock, and Skut end up on his yacht (a caricature of Aristotle Onassis luxurious yacht Christina), he tricks them into getting on Allan's ship, which he later tries to have torpedoed after the crew evacuate and a plan to destroy it in a fire fails. Rastapopulos fakes his death by making his boat sink, while escaping in a submarine from the bottom. (In The Castafiore Emerald, Bianca Castafiore mentions that the media has inaccurately claimed she was engaged to be married to the Marquis di Gorgonzola.) He later kidnaps the millionaire Laszlo Carreidas in Flight 714 to Sydney to gain the number of his multi-million Swiss Bank account, concluding that it is easier to steal Carreidas's money than make his own fortune all over again. When he is accidentally injected with truth serum by Dr. Krollspell, he reveals various evil deeds, such as his plan to kill Dr. Krollspell afterwards. He is taken hostage by Tintin. Like Krollspell and Carreidas, he is tied up and gagged with sticking plaster. Throughout the course of the story he suffers more and more injuries. First when Haddock breaks his gun chasing Rastapopoulos, he throws part of it away, and it hits the hiding Rastapopoulos on the head. When he continues to run away and is called to by Allan, he is distracted and crashes into a tree. He experiences pain to the face when Allan pulls the sticking plaster off. When Allan is about to throw a grenade at Tintin and Co, he remembers that Rastapopoulos wants Carreidas alive and throws it away. Rastapopoulos is caught in the blast, leaving his clothes in tatters. When Allan pulls Carreidas' hat from under a stone head, he accidentally elbows Rastapopoulos, giving him a black eye. Later his bump on the head goes away, which he takes as a good omen. However a piece of rock falls onto his head just after he notices this as the result of an earthquake, causing another bump. When explosives are used by the gang to break through a stone barrier, a volcanic eruption is set off, forcing them to flee from the Island in a rubber dinghy. He and his gang are hypnotized by Mik Kanrokitoff and taken onto a UFO. What happens next to them is unrevealed. In the unfinished Tintin and Alph-Art, a character often thought to be Rastapopoulos in disguise‚Äîunder the name of Endaddine Akass‚Äîappears. Although a page revealing Akass to be Rastapopoulos was started (and printed in the 2004 Egmont edition), as the book was never completed, Rastapopoulos' fate following Flight 714 to Sydney is unknown. Rastapopoulos also appears in Tintin and the Lake of Sharks, an animated film and later adapted into a similarly titled book. In this story written by a friend of Herg√©, Rastapopoulos is a criminal gang leader directing operations from a secret underwater base. He is behind numerous robberies of valuable items around the world and plans to steal a duplicating machine invented by Professor Calculus, allowing him to replace the items with perfect fakes so that nobody will know of his crimes. However while trying to escape by submarine after his activities are exposed, he is captured by Tintin and Haddock, and arrested by the Syldavian Police. Rastapopoulos appears in the pastiche Destination World by Didier Savard, a pastiche authorized by the Herg√© Foundation to celebrate Tintin's 70th birthday and the Comics Festival in Angoul√™me. A disguised Rastapopoulos is shot with a gun by unknown assailants passing in a car in front of the building Le Monde. Critical analysis Michael Farr argued that the relationship between Tintin and Rastapopoulos was akin to that between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty in Arthur Conan Doyle's stories. Farr thought that Rastapopoulos was the one enemy who \\"it must be feared, might one day get the better of him.\\" See also * List of The Adventures of Tintin characters  References  =Footnotes= =Bibliography=  * * Category:Tintin characters Category:Comics characters introduced in 1934 Category:Fictional crime bosses Category:Fictional drug dealers Category:Fictional smugglers Category:Fictional kidnappers Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional marquesses and marchionesses Category:Comic strip villains Category:Male characters in comics ","title":"Rastapopoulos"},{"id":"40280278","text":"Everyday Is Like Sunday is a 2013 Canadian independent film directed by Pavan Moondi.

Port Clarence Bay is the large bight in the southeast; Grantley Harbor extends inland to the east of it. Grantley Harbor (native name, Kaviak) is a waterway located at the bay of Port Clarence, Alaska, on the Seward Peninsula in the U.S. state of Alaska. The inner harbor at the entrance to the northeast corner of the bay was named after Lord Grantley. History Teller located on a spit between Port Clarence and Grantley Harbor The area between Grantley Harbor, Port Clarence and Golovnin Bay was inhabited by the Kaveahrachamutes. The regional headquarters of the Russo-American Telegraph Expedition of 1865‚Äì67 were located on Grantley Harbor, while the headquarters of Teller Reindeer Station were established nearby in 1892 by Sheldon Jackson. The town of Teller on Grantley Harbor was inhabited by prospectors during the Nome Gold Rush. Geography Grantley is an inner harbor, opening into the northeast corner of the bay of Port Clarence. The sand pits at the opening of the bay are named Points Spencer and Jackson after the officers of the Navy. It is a marshy and low land with many lakes. Point Spencer, the extremity of the low sand spit which extends from the coast, forms the south and west sides of the harbor. At the extreme eastern end of the bay are two narrow sand spits, extending from the northern and southern shores, which enclose Grantley Harbor. The harbor's entrance is about in width, from east to west, and from north to south. At the extreme eastern end of Grantley Harbor is a second strait, about wide, which connects with a third body of water, Imourouk Lake. To the north of Grantley Harbor, Muck-a-Charlie Peak rises to a peak. On its eastern side, the harbor connect with a channel of water long which passes hills measuring at least in height on each side. The Agiapuk River flows parallel with Grantley Harbor for about , separated by an upland. The settlement of Nook was at one time situated on the south side of the harbor's mouth. The depth of water in the bay is adequate for ships to ply. The Bluestone River gold mining region is situated south of the harbor. Several streams empty into the harbor, including Coyote, Dese, and Sunset creeks. Moss-covered lowland of Sunest Creek borders Grantley Harbor. Iglook Creek enters the harbor east of Sunset Creek. The short streams which flow into the harbor are of 2‚Äì3 miles length of which two are from the southern end and four from the northern side. Their origin is in the Mountain Mokacharni and flows through a dissected plateau forming the upland. Geology Geological formation in harbor area consists of Nome series bed rocks, folded graphite slates with some amount coal veins in the valleys of the creeks that flow into the harbor. A study of the geological map of the region shows extensive greenstone at the eastern part of the bay which is inferred as an intrusive in limestone formations that are placed below the slate formation. Limestone formations are noted in the northern stream that flow into the harbor and to the west of the harbor (Reindeer Station) Ordovician fossils are found in the limestone formations. The northern shore of the harbor has bed rock formations of mica-schist and greenstone. The Mukhacharni Mountain and its two adjoining mountains have basaltic rock formations of volcanic origin of pre-Pleistocene age. Minerals Gold was found in 1900 in three of the creeks that flow into the harbour when stakes have been claimed. These formations carry mineralized quartz. Gold has been extracted from Sunset Creek (5 miles long) and Igloo Creek also. Aquafauna Fish species of Pacific sandlance (Ammodytes personatus) is found in fairly large number in the harbor. They feed on crustaceans, barnacle larve, copepods, and chaetognaths. They in turn are the food chain and form the feed source for marine mammals, birds and other species of fish. Seals are spotted, ringed, and bearded species; spotted is seen when the sea is calm (seals and seal oil form the staple diet of the people who live on the shores of the harbor in towns like Teller). Herring, whitefish, starry flounder, pike and tomcod are netted during spring, fall and midsummer. All five salmon species are found here of which red salmon is the primary catch and they migrate inland to the Salmon Lake to breed. Chum salmon migrate to the Pilgrim River and Agiapuk River. King salmon are rare. Avifauna Bird species recorded in the harbor are Pelagic cormorant, pigeon guillemot, horned puffin, common eider, black scoter, Arctic terns, glaucous gulls and White wagtails.

Premise A frog-like alien attacks a group of teenagers who are camping, to mate with the girls. A boy's previous horror film viewing helps them fight against the monster. Production Kanefsky directed this film when he was 20 years old. The film satirizes horror films, five years before Scream would be released. A review for DVD Verdict said that the difference between There's Nothing Out There and Scream is that the first film is a comedy, while the other film can stand alone as a horror film. Various horror films are referenced, including Psycho. There's Nothing Out There was filmed with 16 mm film, with the editing done on a Steenbeck. The film was finished in 1990 and was first released in 1991. After the film's success at the Independent Film Project film festival, they attempted to have a film studio release it. The director said of the film studios, \\"We had some important screenings, but the studios didn't understand the film. It was a horror film and a comedy that talked about horror films\\". He also compared his film to Scream. The audience at every showing, including critics, enjoyed the film. It had a showing in New York City and Los Angeles, but no profit was made. The film rights were sold to Image Entertainment in 1992, and the company released the film on VHS and laser disc. The film aired on HBO and Cinemax in 1993. Reception Tom Becker, of DVD Verdict, concluded his review with, \\"A cool, if slightly loquacious, release from Troma, There's Nothing Out There is a fun little film that's worth checking out\\". A review in VideoHound's Cult Flicks & Trash Pics said, \\"In general, this no-budget parody of screen schlock is barely better than the dreck it imitates\\". Home media Image Entertainment released the film on VHS and laser disc in 1992. It was released on DVD in 2011 by Troma Entertainment.

Club career Born in Kilmarnock, James Morton Maxwell's father of the same name was also a footballer prior to his death in World War I, at which time his son was four years old. 'Bud' became known for his skills at school and was selected for Scotland at that level, thereafter becoming an apprentice at hometown club Kilmarnock, also working at a shoe manufacturer. Maxwell quickly emerged as a prolific goalscorer (displacing Peerie Cunningham whose record was also strong)Kilmarnock in History: Nibloe's tough exit, Kilmarnock FC, 9 July 2020 and becoming Kilmarnock's second highest goalscorer of their history in just four seasons, with 103 goals in 126 League games plus 19 goals in 21 Scottish Cup games.

He served with the Royal Navy throughout the war, mainly in the North Atlantic on submarine hunting/convoy escort duty. He played as a guest for Greenock Morton in the wartime Scottish Southern League a number of times while on leave from the navy. After the war, he trained with Preston but his registration was still held by Barnsley, who would not allow him to sign for a divisional rival; instead he joined Shrewsbury Town of the Midland League for a short spell lasting until the end of 1946.

Both terms refer to an informal means for computer users to exchange messages commonly referred to as \\"chats\\". Instant messaging can be compared to texting as opposed to making a mobile phone call. In the case of messaging, it is like the short form of emailing. Secure instant messaging is a specialized form of instant messaging that along with other differences, encrypts and decrypts the contents of the messages such that only the actual users can understand them.  Instant messaging background  Instant messaging has existed in some form or another for decades. Generally, it is a process by which users on a computer network can quickly communicate with one another using short text-based sentences rather than using email. Each user has a piece of software that communicates with a common server that connects the chat sessions. Over the past few years, two distinct settings for the use of instant messaging have evolved. The first is the corporate or institutional environment composed of many potential users but who are all under the same organizational umbrella. The second setting is individual users \\"after work\\" or at home who do not have a mission-oriented commonality between them, but are more likely family and friends. In the corporate setting, security risks are apparent from the outset. What stops a disgruntled employee from messaging some sensitive company data to a colleague outside the enterprise? The reverse of that would be the example disgruntled employee downloading some virus or spyware onto his machine inside the corporate firewall to release as desired. Accordingly, organizational offerings have become very sophisticated in their security and logging measures. Typically, an employee or organization member must be granted a login and suitable permissions to use the messaging system. This creating of a specific account for each user allows the organization to identify, track and record all use of their messenger system on their servers. The specialized requirements of the organizational messaging system, however, run almost completely contrary to what an individual user may need. Typically non- organizational use instant messengers advertise their availability to the Internet at large so that others may know if that person is online. The trend has been too that manufacturers of instant messaging clients offer interoperability with other manufacturer's clients. This competitive edge grew out of the heretofore use of proprietary communications protocols used by the client manufacturers. Compatibility between clients is likely to become almost universal, as a unified messenger protocol (the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)) is being adopted by more and more manufacturers. The XMPP has been, at least in part, formalized by the Internet Engineering Task Force as RFC 6120, RFC 6121 and RFC 6122 which will further the trend towards instant messaging standardization. For the typical social individual user this product evolution spells greater ease of use and more features.  Traits of a secure instant messenger  In November 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation listed seven traits that contribute to the security of instant messengers: * Having communications encrypted in transit between all the links in the communication path. * Having communications encrypted with keys the provider does not have access to (end-to-end encryption). * Making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondent's identity e.g. by comparing key fingerprints. * Having past communications secure if the encryption keys are stolen (forward secrecy). * Having the source code open to independent review (open source). * Having the software's security designs well-documented. * Having a recent independent security audit. In addition, the security of instant messengers may further be improved if they: * Do not log or store any information regarding any message or its contents. * Do not log or store any information regarding any session or event. * Do not rely on a central authority for the relaying of messages (decentralized computing). Recent news events have revealed that the NSA is not only collecting emails and IM messages but also tracking relationships between senders and receivers of those chats and emails in a process known as metadata collection. Metadata refers to the data concerned about the chat or email as opposed to contents of messages. It may be used to collect valuable information.

He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played first-class cricket for Leicestershire between 1950 and 1953. He was born in Eastwell, Leicestershire and died at Cape Town, South Africa. Goodson played as an amateur player in a single first-class match for Leicestershire in 1950, scoring just one run in two innings and failing to take a wicket. He reappeared in eight games in the middle of the 1953 season, but again had very little success. In 1957, Goodson took five wickets in an innings in a rain-hit non-first-class inter-service match while playing for the Army. This encouraged Leicestershire, which by that time had a second eleven playing in the Minor Counties Championship, to give him a further trial, but although he played regularly for the second team across 1958, he did not reappear in first-class cricket, and the 1953 matches were his last.

Their exploits are fictionalized in the 1981 film Cattle Annie and Little Britches, directed by Lamont Johnson and starring Diane Lane as Little Britches. Background Born Jennie Stevens in Barton County in southwestern Missouri, to a farm couple, Daniel and Lucy Stevenson, her one known sister was Victoria Estella Stevenson. Apparently she dropped the \\"son\\" from her maiden name; her second husband was apparently named \\"Stephens\\", not \\"Stevens.\\" For a time, therefore, she was Jennie Stevenson Stephens. The Stevenson family lived during part of the 1880s in Seneca in Newton County, also in southwestern Missouri on the eastern border of Oklahoma, then Indian Territory. The Stevensons then moved into the Creek Nation at Sinnett in Pawnee County in the northern Indian Territory. Little Britches followed stories of the Bill Doolin gang written by such dime novelists as Ned Buntline, like her friend Cattle Annie (born Anna Emmaline McDoulet). Enchantment with crime Little Britches joined the Doolin gang but lost her horse and returned home to the stern rebuke of her father. She was determined nevertheless to pursue a life of crime, and she married a deaf-mute horse dealer, Benjamin Midkiff, in March 1895. They established housekeeping in a hotel in Perry in Noble County in northern Oklahoma. Midkiff found her unfaithful, however, and he returned the teenager to her father after the two had been together for only six weeks. Within a day of returning home, she began riding along the Arkansas River in search of outlaw adventure. Soon she apparently married Robert Stephens, but the union lasted only six months. At a community dance Jennie and Annie met the Doolin gang, later called the Wild Bunch (not the Butch Cassidy gang of the same name). These outlaws, all eleven of whom met violent deaths, maintained a hideaway in the Creek Nation Cave, located on the Cimarron River in Payne County near Ingalls east of Stillwater, Oklahoma. At a shootout in Ingalls in 1893, three marshals were killed. Little Britches and Cattle Annie were excellent horse riders and sharpshooters who dressed in men's clothing. The two women evaded law enforcement and became known for their daring pursuits throughout the region. The pair sold whisky to the Osage and Pawnee tribes and engaged in horse theft, operating either together or alone. They alerted other outlaws about the location of law enforcement officers. In mid-August 1895, Little Britches was captured, but she soon escaped from a restaurant in Pawnee, Oklahoma Territory, while she was in the custody of Sheriff Frank Lake. Journalist accounts maintain that she left through the back door of the establishment despite the presence of a guard. She tore off her dress, grabbed the horse of a deputy marshal, and galloped away into the night. U.S. Marshals Bill Tilghman and his deputy Steve Burke quickly tracked down Annie and Little Britches. Burke caught Cattle Annie as she was climbing from a window, but Tilghman had more difficulty apprehending Little Britches, who fired a Winchester rifle at both lawmen. Tilghman then shot Little Britches' horse. As the animal fell to the ground, Little Britches was taken into custody and jailed, but only after she had tried to shoot Tilghman with a pistol and then to attack him physically. Alternate reports The Oklahoma Journal of History and Culture contends that Tilghman likely had nothing to do with the apprehension of Little Britches. Newspapers credited both captures to Lake, Burke, and Frank Canton, another deputy marshal. The publication further contends that neither girl had been involved with the Doolins or any other outlaw gang. Imprisonment The two young women were tried for horse theft and the sale of alcohol to the Indians before U.S. District Judge Andrew Gregg Curtin Bierer, Sr. (1862-1951) at his court in Guthrie in Logan County, capital of the Oklahoma Territory. Little Britches was incarcerated for two months in the Guthrie jail (under the name Jennie Midkiff, from her first husband of six weeks) as a material witness in a murder trial. She had witnessed a shooting while working as a domestic. Little Britches' two-year prison sentence for horse theft and selling whisky to the Indians began in 1895 at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Framingham. She was released in October 1896, under terms of good behavior, and returned to her parents. Her final years are unknown, though some stories circulated that she married for a third time, reared a family, and led an exemplary life thereafter in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cattle Annie received a one-year sentence and was also sent to Framingham in 1895. Because of poor health, she was paroled, but remained in Framingham for some time. In popular culture =In film= In the film Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1981), directed by Lamont Johnson, Diane Lane portrays Little Britches, Amanda Plummer makes her film debut as Cattle Annie, Burt Lancaster is an historically inaccurate and much older Bill Doolin, Rod Steiger is Marshal Tilghman, Scott Glenn is Bill Dalton, and Buck Taylor (known as the young gunsmith-turned-part-time-deputy and apprentice medical doctor on CBS's Gunsmoke) plays Dynamite Dick, a fictionalized character conflating elements of several real people. Bill Doolin was shot to death at the age of 38 by Marshal Heck Thomas; Lancaster was 67 when he played Doolin in the film. =In print= Novelist Robert Ward, a native of Baltimore, Maryland, wrote Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1977), his personal interpretation of the romantic legends of the Doolin-Dalton gang. =In television= Actress Gloria Winters (of the Sky King aviation adventure television series) portrayed Little Britches in a 1954 episode of the syndicated Stories of the Century, a western anthology series starring and narrated by Jim Davis. In this story, Little Britches became smitten with an outlaw named Dave Ridley, played by James Best, rather than Bill Doolin. Little Britches is shown at the conclusion of the episode leaving the Framingham reformatory and anonymously working in a soup kitchen in a slum section of New York City. In the 1962 episode \\"Girl with a Gun\\", on the anthology series, Death Valley Days, Anne Helm filled the title role of Jennie Metcalf, with Ken Mayer as Marshal Hobe Martin. Other uses of Little Britches \\"Little Britches\\" is used across the United States as the proper name of numerous business, including day-care centers, pediatric clinics, clothing stores, bakeries, boutiques, and even an employment agency for nannies. Nor should Little Britches the outlaw be confused with: *The childhood autobiography by Ralph Moody entitled, Little Britches: Father and I Were Ranchers (1991), the story of a boy growing up on a ranch near Littleton, Colorado. *The National Little Britches Rodeo Association, which bills itself as the \\"oldest, continuing junior rodeo association in the nation,\\" directed toward the interests of western-minded youth.

The album was recorded for Crosby's label, Project Records, and released by MGM. Crosby and Armstrong worked together many times before they recorded this album, appearing in films such as Pennies from Heaven (1936), Here Comes the Groom (1951), and High Society (1956). They made several radio broadcasts together between 1949 and 1951. The lyrics of the songs were adapted for them by a number of notable songwriters. Eleven tracks were issued on the LP, excluding \\"(Up A) Lazy River\\" because Armstrong had recorded it for another company. Permission was granted for it to be included in the All Star Festival LP issued in 1963 on behalf of the United Nations to help refugees around the world. Johnny Mercer sings a few lines with the chorus on this track. \\"Dardanella\\" and \\"Muskrat Ramble\\" were released as singles in October 1960. Billboard magazine commented that the tracks would be popular with \\"jocks\\". Reception The Billboard magazine review from 31 October 1960 selected the album for its pop spotlight and called it a \\"group of nostalgic tunes that provide excellent easy listening programming.\\" Variety said that the album \\"provides a lot of listening pleasure. Both are masters of their craft and know how to pack a vocal punch with seemingly little effort. John Bush on Allmusic.com gave the album three and half stars out of five. Bush said that \\"Could anything but warmth and playfulness result when the two most seminal, expressive voices of the 20th century found the room to stretch out on a full LP together?\\".

Biography Born in Philadelphia, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1882; was lecturer at the Franklin Institute 1883‚Äì86; Professor of Physics and Chemistry in the Philadelphia Manual Training School 1889‚Äì91, principal 1893‚Äì95; Ph.D. at Zurich in 1892; lecturer on education at Harvard 1897‚Äì98; and director Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, 1898‚Äì99. Professor Henderson was a major figure in the creation of educational camps for boys. He founded Camp Marienfeld a Summer Camp for Boys and was its headmaster for 17 years, and was headmaster of the Marienfeld Open-Air School at Samarcand, North Carolina, 1914‚Äì16. Marienfeld; a pioneer among camps was established by Dr. Henderson in the summer of 1896 in Milford, Pennsylvania, and was moved to Chesham, New Hampshire in 1899 and operated into the 1950s. It was a study camp for boys and stressed the educational program of the progressive camp. Dr. Henderson was an early proponent of manual training and the Arts and Crafts movement in industry. He advocated redesigning the school to suit the nature and needs of the child. Marietta Johnson, the founder of the Marietta Johnson School of Organic Education in Fairhope, Alabama credited Dr. Henderson with having coined the term \\"organic education\\" in his 1902 book Education and the Larger Life which was one of her educational bibles. Dr. Henderson was then a rival of John Dewey in the education reform movement. Although Dewey grew greatly in stature, Henderson was highly regarded and spent his career implementing reform. He was a prolific author who wrote about progressive education, manual training for boys, the value of hand work and the benefits of summer camps. Dr. Henderson's reputation rests largely on his academic papers published in periodicals such as Popular Science, Harper's Magazine, the Atlantic Monthly and the North American Review. His books include: Elements of Physics (1900); Education and the Larger Life (1902); John Percyfield: The Anatomy of Cheerfulness (1903); Children of Good Fortune (1905); Lighted Lamp (1908); Pay-day (1911); What It Is to Be Educated (1914).

Before retiring from teaching, Baldwin had previously worked as a lecturer at both the University of Leicester and the University of Nottingham. In 1986, over 25 years before the 2012 excavation and the discovery of the king's body, he predicted that Richard III's remains would be found at Greyfriars, Leicester. In his 2010 book, Robin Hood: The English Outlaw Unmasked, Baldwin argued that the 'real' Robin Hood was Roger Godberd, a disinherited supporter of Simon de Montfort.> He drew attention to the many similarities between Godberd's career and the stories told of Robin in the earliest ballads, and to a grave slab in Loxley churchyard in Warwickshire which appeared to be identical to one associated with Robin in earlier centuries. In his 2007 book, The Lost Prince: The Survival of Richard of York, Baldwin discussed the possibility that the younger of the Princes in the Tower, Prince Richard, survived, and was the \\"Richard Plantagenet\\" who died in December 1550 at Eastwell in Kent. Richard had worked as a bricklayer at St. John's Abbey, Colchester, until 1539, but, unusually for someone of his class, could read Latin.

He embarked on a career as an entertainer, performing at clubs and touring a school show called ‚ÄòSingabout Australia‚Äô. His break came when Warner/Chappell Music signed him to a publishing deal and two songs from his album It's Nothing Serious, produced by Greg Champion, became hits. \\"Don't Call Wagga Wagga Wagga\\", recorded with Champion and Ted Egan, was a number 2 hit in 1994 and \\"Since Cheryl Went Feral\\" topped the country charts for 5 weeks in 1995. Haynes signed a three-record deal with ABC Music and began touring his own show and also touring with other artists like Slim Dusty, Adam Brand, Melinda Schneider, Greg Champion and Beccy Cole. He has since recorded quite a few albums of songs, verse and humour on his own label Singabout Australia. A double CD of old material, The Complete Jim Haynes Collection, was released in 2011 and an album of new songs, Galah Occasion, appeared in 2012, featuring duets with Wayne Horsburgh and Melanie Dyer. Having 'invented' the perfect country town of Weelabarabak in the 1980s, Haynes began writing verse about the town and its characters and events. These poems were self-published as I'll Have Chips! which sold over 10 000 copies. A book of short stories, Memories of Weelabarabak, followed - published by ABC Books. Haynes‚Äô Aussie Verse column was a weekly feature of the nation's oldest magazine Australasian Post, until its demise in 2004. He has now written, compiled and edited twenty books, including The Book of Australian Popular Rhymed Verse, which contains 1000 poems from early colonial days to the present and The Big Book of Verse for Aussie Kids - which contains over 600 rhymed poems. Haynes is also credited with starting morning shows at the Tamworth Country Music Festival, having set up the very first ‚Äôbush verse‚Äô morning show in 1989. His Big Bush Brekky Variety Show has been a feature of the Festival for almost twenty years. Jim was inducted into the Australian Country Music Hands of Fame in 1997. He also helped establish the Australian Bush Laureate Awards for recorded and published verse and the Stone The Crows Festival in Wagga Wagga which recognises the talents of Grey Nomads with the annual GReyVee Awards. He also regularly hosts ‚ÄòVerse, History and Country Music‚Äô trips to Norfolk Island to coincide with the Norfolk Island Country Music Festival. Haynes served on the board of the Country Music Association of Australia for fifteen years, was involved in the very successful Academy of Australian Country Music and still runs the Academy course for the parents of young talented performers. Haynes continues to work in radio, presenting the weekend Australiana segment on Radio 2UE‚Äôs George and Paul Show and spends much of his time writing and editing collections of Australian verse and prose.

The concept was to create a man-made mountain in a country famed for its generally flat landscape. It was suggested in a column by Thijs Zonneveld, whose thoughts on the idea were initially intended to be comedic. However, it quickly gained attention due to serious responses and feasibility studies. Initial suggestion In July 2011, Thijs Zonneveld, a journalist and semi-professional cyclist, wrote a column in NU.nl about the need for a mountain in the Netherlands. He proposed that the country should build a mountain tall and wide. Although not intended to be a serious suggestion, it quickly gained support from organisations including the Dutch Ski Association, Dutch Climbing and Mountaineering Association (NKBV), and Royal Dutch Cycling Union (KNWU). Zonneveld's column suggested that there would be significant benefits to Dutch sport, noting a lack of success in ski-jumping, bobsledding, and cycling. He also wrote about the possibility of including a road with hairpin bends and an ice rink. There would be further benefits for athletes who would be able to train at high altitudes. Feasibility Initial feasibility studies suggested that the construction might be possible but only if it were hollow. If a solid mountain of the proposed size were to be constructed it would take up to of sand weighing 2.7 billion tons. The weight of this addition to the landscape could affect ground levels for distances up to away, lowering the altitude by up to . The required volume of materials needed for the construction of the project would be a significant barrier to its success in terms of availability and financial cost. There would also be substantial carbon dioxide emissions in the production of the materials. In early 2012, Bartels Consulting Engineers gathered mathematicians from across Europe to investigate the potential problems that could be encountered with the construction. They met as part of the 2012 Mathematics with Industry conference in Eindhoven. They looked into the possibility that the weight of the structure might affect minor geological faults and cause earthquakes, and how the weather systems might be changed by the structure. The Mathematics with Industry report summarises: A report by the Eindhoven University of Technology later in 2012 demonstrated that the proposal was not financially feasible, with potential costs reaching up to 7 trillion euros. Zonneveld at that time suggested a more modest altitude of , with the possibility of later construction to higher elevations. =Potential locations= Relief map of the Netherlands. Zonneveld suggested that there would be sufficient available space in the north-east of the Netherlands or that land could be reclaimed from the sea. At the 2012 Mathematics with Industry conference in Eindhoven, eight potential locations were investigated, with six being ruled out. They decided that building off the coast of Zeeland or in the IJsselmeer close to Flevoland would too badly affect shipping routes particularly around Rotterdam. Air traffic from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol meant that building in the Markermeer could prove problematic. The build would be likely to affect local ecosystems and the suggestion of construction being sited near the island of Texel was ruled out because of the environmental problems that it might cause. Creating the mountain in the sea near The Hague might amplify or change the currents around the area, contributing to coastal erosion. Though there would be the potential to harness this for use as a form of sustainable energy it was ruled out pending computer simulations. In order to minimise the effect on existing infrastructure the team decided that building the mountain in the IJsselmeer near to the Afsluitdijk would be unwise. They therefore favoured a build in the North Sea near Bergen aan Zee or in the province of Flevoland.

From 1900-1916 it was called \\"Association of Christian German Farmers Associations\\" and from 1931-1934 it used the name \\"Association of German Christian Farmers Associations\\".  History  The Association of the German Farmers Associations was an umbrella organization of Christian farmers‚Äô organizations which belongs to mostly the Catholic milieu. It united mainly small and medium farmers. The VdB was politically associated with the right-wing of the Centre Party. It was established as the \\"Association of Christian German Farmer Associations\\" on November 24 1900 at a Conference in Frankfurt am Main, by representatives of the Baden, Bavaria, Alsace, Hesse, Nassau, Eastern and West Prussian, Rhenish, Silesian, Trier and Westphalian farmer associations. The member organizations, especially in the Catholic regions of Western and southern Germany, had been established in the 1880s and 1890s. In North and Eastern areas farmers were more frequently associated with the Agrarian League and the National Agricultural League. The emergence of these farmer associations can be seen in the broader context of the history of political Catholicism and the Catholic associations of the 19th century. VdB was a sister organization of the Bavarian People's Party (BVP) which had been established as a splinter of the Center Party in 1919. The Bavarian People's Party was a more politically oriented than the VdB. The VdB was closely intertwined with the cooperative movement. The revolution of 1918 allowed the Christian Farmers Associations to recruit many new members and to attract new member organizations because farmers were enthusiastic about demands by the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany and the majority Social Democratic Party of Germany for economic socialization as well as for the separation of Church and State in cultural and educational policy. At this time the VdB was able to recruit Protestant farmers‚Äô association members. With the agricultural crisis in the second half of the 1920s came fierce controversies within the Association as conservative and Protestant member associations demand a stronger Weimar Republic government and more cooperation with other, usually far more right-oriented, farmers‚Äô associations. This led to splits and exclusions. The new President Andreas Hermes, long time Minister of Agriculture and food for the Centre Party (Germany) attempted to stop this development, but only partially succeeded. The Westphalian and Rhenish nobility demanded right oriented policy. In February 1929 the \\"Green Front\\" was formed by the Association of Christian German Farmers Associations, many of its member organizations, the National Agricultural League, the German Agriculture Council (Deutsche Landwirtschafsrat) and the German Farmers' Party (Deutsche Bauernshaft). This agricultural alliance supported state protectionist agriculture. Hermes, who resisted the Nazi claim to power in 1933, was arrested. His successor was ready to participate in the NS State. The National Socialist agricultural leader Richard Walther Darr√© disbanded the Association of German Farmers Associations on January 18, 1934. The member associations had been disbanded the previous year.

In 1987, during their minor underground success, Conway left the band and was replaced by Bilinda Butcher. Since 1991, Conway has written four novels, including 2009's Tokyo Gothic and 2010's Celebrity Bedlam, published numerous short stories and contributed his writing to a selection of comic books. His writings are published by Radical Robot Books‚Äîhis own publishing company‚Äîand Double Dragon Publishing. Conway lives in London. Early life David Conway was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1963. He was raised in both Ireland and the United Kingdom and attended Irish Catholic schools, including Christian Brothers and Jesuit institutions. Conway dropped out of school and spent a number of years working in Dublin. Career =Music career: 1983‚Äì1987= In 1983, Conway formed My Bloody Valentine with Kevin Shields and Colm √ì C√≠os√≥ig. He performed vocals, originally under the pseudonym Dave Stelfox, and suggested the name of the band, which was taken from the 1981 Canadian slasher film of the same name. Shields later claimed he was unaware of the film when Conway suggested the name, which was chosen ahead of other potential band names including The Burning Peacocks. My Bloody Valentine experienced a number of line-up changes in their initial months and in 1984, Conway's girlfriend Tina Durkin was recruited as a keyboard player. On the suggestion of Shields, Conway contacted Gavin Friday, lead vocalist of the post-punk band Virgin Prunes, for advice on succeeding on the Dublin music scene and was given a list of contacts to secure the band shows in Tilburg, Netherlands. The band emigrated to the Netherlands in early 1984 but due to a lack of correct documentation, they had to relocate again to West Germany, where they released their debut mini album, This is Your Bloody Valentine, in January 1985. The album failed to receive much attention and the band returned temporarily to the Netherlands, before settling in London, United Kingdom in the middle of 1985. Conway was featured on the band's debut extended play (EP) Geek! (1985) and the follow-up EP The New Record by My Bloody Valentine (1986). The New Record by My Bloody Valentine was the band's first minor success, peaking at number 22 on the UK Independent Albums Chart upon its release. His final recording with My Bloody Valentine was the 1987 single \\"Sunny Sundae Smile\\", which peaked at number 6 on the UK Independent Singles Chart and secured the band a support slot with The Soup Dragons. In March 1987, after the final date of the tour, Conway announced his decision to leave the band, due to a gastric illness, disillusionment with music and ambitions to become a writer. He was replaced by Bilinda Butcher. =Writing career: 1991‚Äìpresent= During his time working various jobs in the late 1980s, Conway began writing. His short horror fiction stories appeared in various Creation Books anthologies, including Eloise featured in 1991's Red Stains and Black Static featured in 1994's The Starry Wisdom: A Tribute to HP Lovecraft. In 1998, Metal Sushi, a collection of his short science fiction stories, was published by Oneiros Books. Critical reception to Metal Sushi was positive and author Grant Morrison referred to Conway as \\"the most powerful and distinctive writer of horror fiction since Clive Barker.\\" In addition to his short stories, Conway contributed his writing to a number of comic books, including Vampirella for Harris Comics, Vampi for Anarchy Studio and X-Men Unlimited for Marvel Comics. In 2009, he self-published his debut novel, Tokyo Gothic, on his own publishing company Radical Robot Books and Double Dragon Publishing.

Brazeau Bottom runs for about 3 miles below this series of rocky bluffs. Brazeau Creek forms the southernmost border of the Brazeau Bottom.  Etymology  The bottom is named for the nearby Brazeau Creek, which in turn was named for Joseph Brazeau (also spelled Obrazo) a merchant from St. Louis, Missouri in the years 1791‚Äì1799, or a member of his family.State Historical Society of Missouri: Perry County Place Names http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/ramsay/ramsay_perry.html  History  The area was first granted by the Spanish colonial authorities to Joseph Manning, with the first European settler in the Brazeau Bottom was George A. Hamilton, a Catholic from Maryland. Hamilton had lived in New Madrid and received permission from Spanish authorities to settle in the Brazeau Bottom in 1797. Other early settlers in the Brazeau Bottom were Hinckson who settled in 1800; Joseph James who settled in 1801, under the verbal permission of the De Luziere, the colonial commandant of New Bourbon, David L. Johnson (1802), William Johnson from Kentucky who settled in 1802, Charles Duncaster, and Samuel Hinch. In 1803, Joseph Fenwick and twenty other Kentucky Catholics established the Fenwick Settlement at the mouth of the Brazeau Creek. The German Saxon Lutheran immigration of 1938-39 brought numerous German settlers to the area and the establishment of Wittenberg.

Background and career  Fields was born into a Ukrainian Jewish family. His family fled antisemitism in Kiev in 1885, and later settled in Dublin. Fields originally ran a sound studio where people could make a recording of their own voice, but later began his photography when he bought a box camera. Fields switched to a Polaroid instant camera later in his career. Field's brother was also a photographer on the bridge. Fields' extensive photographs are recognised as a social record of Dublin from the 1930s to the 1980s, depicting the changing fashions and shopfronts of the city. Nelson's Pillar often featured in Field's photograph until its destruction by Irish republicans in 1966. Fields took an estimated 182,500 photographs of pedestrians on the bridge from the early 1930s until 1985. Notable people photographed by Fields on the bridge included the playwright Brendan Behan, the actors Margaret Rutherford and Gene Tierney, and Prince Monolulu, who claimed to be a chief of the Falasha tribe of Abyssinia, and who wore a headdress and a fur coat. Fields lived in the Dublin suburb of Raheny, and would walk seven miles to and from the bridge each day to work. Field's modus operandi would be to \\"pretend to take a picture of a passer-by and, when they stopped, he'd take the real one. Then he'd give them a ticket and they could collect the photograph from a nearby studio run by his wife; she developed all the photos.\\"  Legacy  Arthur Fields' work has been documented on the interactive documentary website, Man On Bridge: 50 Years as a Photographer on O‚ÄôConnell Bridge produced by El Zorrero Films. The website encourages the public to submit their photographs to an online archive. The web project which features an image archive and documentary videos won best website at the Digital Media Awards in 2015. The Man on Bridge project was also a winner of the Arthur Guinness Projects. In December 2014 an exhibition of 3,400 photographs collected for the project was held at the Gallery of Photography in Dublin. A documentary titled Man On Bridge was produced for RTE and screened at Christmas 2014. The Irish Times called the film a \\"beautifully constructed, subtly emotional documentary\\". The documentary was nominated for an IFTA award for Best Documentary Single in 2015. Two books of Arthur Fields' photographs edited by Ciaran Deeney and David Clarke were published by Colins Press.

When they meet she is very nervous and obviously very ashamed but her experienced suitor manages to euphemize the situation. He tells her this business is only about fantasy and nowadays everything is for sale, including fantasy fulfillment. His payment enables her to pay bills and to have a little party. She continues to meet men for money and Joe becomes a regular. But while she gets used to the money she doesn't get used to what she has to do for it.

Beebee's work has been influential across a wide variety of fields, including causation, free will, and natural kinds. Eric Schliesser, writing on NewApps, described Beebee as 'one of the most prominent metaphysicists of our time.' Beebee has a significant interest in the problem of underrepresentation of women in the field of philosophy, and has spoken about the problems that face women philosophers in a modern academic context, such as in her paper \\"Women and Deviance in Philosophy\\". Education and career Beebee received her bachelor's from the University of Warwick, her master's from the University of Liverpool, and her doctorate from King's College London. Beebee is currently the Samuel Hall Professor of Philosophy at the University of Manchester, a position she has held since 2012. Before her current position, Beebee held full-time appointments at the University of Manchester, and the University of Birmingham. During her time at Birmingham, she served as Head of Department, and later as Head of School. Besides for her permanent appointments, Beebee has also held temporary appointments at the University of Edinburgh, University of St Andrews, and the University College, London, and has also held a postdoctoral position at Australian National University. Research areas A majority of Beebee's research could be broadly classed as dealing with Humeanism and related issues. She has written on a wide variety of topics related to Humeanism, including attempting to tackle the question of whether or not the laws of nature govern what happens, whether inductive scepticism follows necessary from a Humeanistic approach, and whether or not it is possible to observe causal relations in a meaningful way. She has also written on Hume himself. Beebee also has a secondary interest in free will, particularly in bringing Humean approaches to the problem of compatibilitism. Publications Beebee is on the editorial boards of Hume Studies as well as the Australasian Journal of Philosophy. She's also an associate editor of the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science. She has co-authored two textbooks, written two books and numerous book chapters, and published a number of peer-reviewed papers in journals of philosophy.

She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as an ocean escort. She was named for Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Background Flower- class corvettes like Lunenburg serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Lunenburg was ordered on 24 January 1940 as part of the 1939‚Äì1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down George T. Davie & Sons Ltd. at Lauzon, Quebec on 28 September 1940 and launched 10 July 1941. Lunenburg was commissioned at Quebec City on 4 December 1941. During her career Lunenburg went through three significant refits. The first took place after she was assigned to duties associated with Operation Torch in 1942. Upon arrival in the United Kingdom, she was given added AA armaments to protect her against the increased chance of aerial bombardment. Her second major refit began in March 1943 at Liverpool, Nova Scotia and was completed on 17 August 1943. During this refit her fo'c'sle was extended. Her third and final significant refit began in the Fall of 1944 at Saint John and was completed at Halifax mid-January 1945. Service history Chipping ice on Lunenburg, January 1942 After initial workups, Lunenburg was deployed as a local escort. In July 1942 she transferred to Halifax Force and escorted convoys between Quebec and Labrador. In August 1942, Lunenburg was reassigned to the Gulf Escort Force before being sent to the United Kingdom in September as part of Canadas contribution to Operation Torch. Beginning in November 1942, Lunenburg began escorting convoys between the United Kingdom and sites around and within the Mediterranean Sea. She was occupied with this for the next four months, until she was dispatched to Canada for a major refit. Upon resumption of her service in November 1943, she was assigned to Western Approaches Command under Royal Navy control as part of escort group EG 6. For the following five months, she escorted convoys to and from the United Kingdom. When the group replaced its corvettes with frigates, Lunenburg was sent to Portsmouth after being assigned to Operation Neptune, the naval aspect of the invasion of Normandy. She was employed mainly in the English Channel for the next five months before returning to Canada in the Fall of 1944 for a major refit. After workups in Bermuda Lunenburg returned to her duties in the English Channel, this time attached to Plymouth Command. She served with them until the end of the war, returning to Canada in June 1945 for the last time. Lunenburg was paid off at Sorel, Quebec on 23 July 1945. The ship was sold for scrapping in June 1946 and was broken up at Hamilton, Ontario.

Mfg. Co. or more simply North Bros.), was an American manufacturer based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that specialized in the making of hand tools, small appliances and some specialized power tools. They were family owned and operated for over 60 years before being acquired by the Stanley Works in 1946. They are probably most well known for their line of tools, particularly the \\"Yankee\\" brand of ratcheting screwdrivers.  History  Founded in 1878 the company was originally only a foundry operation solely owned by Selden Gladwin North. In 1880 Selden was joined by his brother Ralph H. North and the company become North Bros. Frank H. North became the third brother to join the company in 1886. By 1887 the company had broadened its operations and was incorporated as the North Bros. Mfg. Co. In 1892 the American Machine Co. of Philadelphia and its \\"Crown\\" consumer brand was acquired and operations were soon moved to its facilities. In 1893 they acquired the Shepard Hdw. Co. of Buffalo, New York. Next, in 1897, they acquired the Forest City Screwdriver and Drill Company of Portland, Maine and its prolific designer Zachary T. Furbish. In 1919 the son of Ralph North, John Spring North, joined the company. By 1900 the company was a major manufacturer and employer in the city of Philadelphia and produced ice cream freezers, ice shaving and crushing tools, kitchen appliances, various other consumer goods and some hand tools. As the 20th century progressed they began to focus on hand tools and eventually become a sizeable player in the hand tool industry. Originally focusing on spiral ratchet and \\"plain\\" screwdrivers they soon expanded to various types of hand tools and eventually became a significant force in the tool industry. Eventually the success of the Yankee line of tools led the Stanley Works tool company to acquire the North Bros. in 1946, chiefly to improve their own product lines. Stanley was primarily interested in their bit and brace designs, which continued to be produced unchanged at Stanley for decades, and the spiral ratchet \\" Yankee\\" screwdrivers. The North Bros. name lived on at Stanley into the 1950s before finally being phased out. The Yankee name continued to be used by Stanley up until the early 2000s before they sold it to the Schroeder tool company. As of 2013 Schroeder of Germany continues to sell \\"Yankee\\" branded screwdrivers and push drills.  Yankee tools  North Bros. key acquisition was the hiring of Zachary Furbish when it purchased the Forest City Screwdriver Co in 1897. He brought with him patents related to a spiral ratchet screw driver and considerable experience in tool design. This was their foothold into the tool manufacturing industry which would later become the core of their business. Furbish alone would eventually amass 30 patents related to hand tools produced by North Bros., despite passing away in 1906, and his designs would become the backbone of their product lines for years to come. North Bros. tool brand was called Yankee, much as Sears tools are branded Craftsman, and every tool they sold sported this trademark. In later years the Yankee name would become synonymous with the spiral ratchet screw driver invented by Furbish but it was originally seen on everything from bench vises to cutting tools. Building upon the line of tools originally made by Forest City, North Bros. soon expanded their selection of offerings. Screwdrivers were joined by push drills, breast drills, hand drills (also called egg beater drills), hand powered bench drills, bit and braces, ratcheting tap wrenches, vises, cutting tools and small tool kits.

Yankee soon became and still is a well-known name in automatic spiral ratchet screwdrivers, with several other models, and model improvements patented by North Bros. over a 40-year period. The term \\"Yankee screwdriver\\" is often used to describe push/pull type screwdriver other than one manufactured by North Brothers Mfg. Co. or Stanley Tools, who purchased the rights to the well-known Yankee brand or trade name in the 1940s from North Brothers. North Brothers always marked the tools they manufactured with the Yankee name, and in most cases the North Bros. name and location as well. All spiral ratchet screwdriver models made by Stanley did have the Yankee trade name on them, or at least until the 1960s when the Handyman trade name became as well known as the Yankee trade name, so Stanley Tools marked certain models with both the Handyman and Yankee brand name on them, and usually the Stanley name was on them as well. The Handyman trade name was not limited to a line of screwdriver models, as the same name was marked on a complete line of planes, drills and other tools specifically marketed to the home user.  Sizes  There were 3 different size spring chucks, and therefore 3 different shank size tips or sometimes called points, to fit various models. Generally all tips made by North Brothers or Stanley were stamped with the corresponding number of the model screwdriver they would fit, but the stamped numbers are often difficult to see, so it's a good idea to know the size you need before you set out to find tips for your screwdriver. * The smallest size was the number 35, so any of the model numbers with 35 in the number, like No. 135A is the smallest tip shank diameter, measuring 7/32\\" diameter shank. (Note that all the handyman models with 33 in their model number also have the No. 35 size chucks, the smallest size tips). * The middle size is the No. 30 size, and all numbers with the 30 in them have a chuck shank size of 9/32\\" diameter. * The biggest size is the No. 31, and all numbers with 31 in them have a chuck diameter of 5/16\\" diameter. By around 2005 Stanley in the USA had discontinued production of all Yankee tools in previous years. Production did continue in the UK until 2007, when tooling for components of screwdrivers were sent to Japan and have now been scrapped. Over the years other manufacturing companies used similar design chucks, that held Yankee brand screwdriver and drill point tips with the flat and notch on the shank.  Accessories and bits  North Brothers offered several different accessories to fit the various type chucks on the Yankee spiral ratchet screwdrivers. Normally, 3 different slot type tips were include with each screwdriver when it was new. Other tips included: *Nut drivers in various sizes, both hex and square head *Drill points for the smallest 133/135 size screwdriver *adapters to adapt push drill size drill point sets to the three sizes of screwdriver chuck size *countersinks *screwdriver tips holding with screw holding feature *Phillips screwdriver tips in various sizes *slot screwdriver tips with the centring sleeve feature, and *extra-long screwdriver tips for special applications.  Other companies  The first patented spiral push drill or similar spiral screwdriver dates back to 1868 known as the Allard's patent, but since we have never been able to find one in existence, we assume that the 1868 patent was never manufactured in quantity. The earliest we have observed is the F. A. Howard patent, known to have sold in the US in quantity. The beginning of production of the Howard screwdriver seems to have been in the early 1870s. Most of the first models patented are rare and hard to find. Although North Brothers was not the very first to patent the spiral type mechanism, they were not far behind in terms of years. Most models were designed and patented post 1900, and companies other than North Brothers joined in around 1920. Over the years Millers Falls not only manufactured their own models, but also manufactured spiral screwdrivers for other companies like \\"Craftsman\\" and these models usually only slightly different, were marked with the Craftsman brand name.  Models  = Yankee \\"A\\" = Generally \\"A\\" is the earlier version with the wooden handle, generally they also don't have the white triangular design printed on the handle, Stanley produced early\\"A\\"s at several different factories so there may be slight differences in size and fitment of bits, most early \\"A\\"s also were marked as to what model of Yankee they are, they are stamped where the slide switch for backwards and forwards is, the early A's were imperial internal measurements and the chucks are very slightly smaller internally. i.e. the 131A takes 5/16\\" = 0.3125\\" bits, and the newer 8mm bits are 0.3150\\". = Yankee \\"B\\" = Generally \\"B\\" is the newer version with a plastic handle, although toward the end of the production they fitted wooden handles, the handle should be marked with the Yankee triangle as mentioned above. These generally are not marked with the type of Yankee they are 131b, 130b etc., they would be stamped where the slide switch for backwards and forwards is situated, Later B's were made in the United Kingdom, West Germany, and the last batches were made in Japan, the B's were metric internal measurements and the chucks are very slightly bigger internally, You may also find that the helix has been machined with flats, whereas A's have a more smooth machined finish to its helix.

He belongs to the Castilian school, following the style of Gregorio Fern√°ndez. His artistic language evolved from the 17th century models to a more rococo and gentle style. He studied in Salamanca with Jos√© de Larra Dom√≠nguez. He mainly worked in Central and Northern Spain. Three of his sons, Gregorio, Isidro and Antonio Carnicero were also artists. Carnicero collaborated on a five-year project with Jos√© de Larra to work on the choir- stalls of Salamanca Cathedral. The work on another choir-stalls, in the monastery of Guadalupe, is also attributed to him. One of his finest moments as an engraver came in 1728, when the Carmelites of the Third Order commissioned him to create wooden figures of the Virgin of Carmen. In 1730 Carnicero began carving stone medallions of the kings. The busts were created to be put on display at Salamanca's Plaza Mayor. He followed this with a wooden figure of St Michael for the hospital of Navas del Rey, Castile. From 1745 to 1750 he worked on creating four wooden figures to be put on display at the Len Cathedral. After that Carnicero was commissioned to create three stone statues of Spanish kings for the Palacio Real in Madrid.  Works  Much of his work consisted of religious works: * Pasos for the Brotherhood of the Vera Cruz in Salamanca * Virgin of Carmen and Simon Stock in Salamanca * Works in the Cathedrals of Salamanca, Plasencia, Le√≥n and Royal Monastery of Guadalupe An important part of his works consisted of civilian sculptures: * Medals in the Plaza Mayor de Salamanca * Kings of Spain in the Royal Palace of Madrid  Sources  * ALBARR√ÅN MART√çN, Virginia, El escultor Alejandro Carnicero entre Valladolid y la Corte (1693-1756), Valladolid: Diputaci√≥n de Valladolid, 2012 * RODR√çGUEZ G.
