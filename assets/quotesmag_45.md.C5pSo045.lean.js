It stars Dick Haymes and Audrey Totter. The story is about a New York nightclub singer who inherits an old riverboat on the Chattahoochee River between Georgia and Alabama. It features comedy, some drama and several musical performances. Plot summary Beau Clemment, a singer in New York City, learns that he has inherited a riverboat once owned by his grandfather, Beauregard, who had won it from its captain, Thaddeus Jackson, in a game of chance. Jackson has been bitter ever since, his old acquaintance Humphrey Hepburn recalling how Beauregard also won the heart of the vessel's star performer, Melissa Curry. Beau travels to Alabama to claim the boat, which he finds in something far less than ship-shape condition. Unsure whether to scrap it or sell what's left of it, Beau meets singer Sally Jane Jackson, granddaughter of Thaddeus, and they develop a mutual attraction. He elects to restore the vessel and launch it with entertainment and gambling. He even recruits Thaddeus's singing butler, William, to perform aboard ship. Thaddeus objects to his ownership and presence, doing everything in his power to scuttle the venture. By the time the law catches up to it, Beau's boat has sailed into Georgia, out of its jurisdiction. Thaddeus, finally accepting the situation, is given a 50-50 interest in the boat with Beau, who is about to wed Sally Jane and become a part of the family.

A Democrat, she was elected to the Michigan State House of Representatives in 2008, representing the 32nd State House District. It includes portions of North and East Macomb County and four rural townships in St. Clair County, and had a history of voting Republican. Prior to her election, Haase worked as an elementary school teacher in Richmond. Biography Jennifer Haase was born on December 20, 1974, in Detroit, Michigan. She graduated from Eisenhower High School, in Shelby Township, Michigan in 1993. She graduated from Alma College in Alma, Michigan with a BA in Elementary Education in 1997. In 1998 she began working as an elementary school teacher in Richmond, where she continued until her election to the State House in 2008. In 2007, Haase completed graduate work, receiving her Masters of Education, Reading and Language Arts from Oakland University. Later that year she became more active in politics, and ran in 2008 for state representative from the 32nd House District of Michigan. Haase worked as an elementary school teacher from 1998 to her election in 2008. She lives in Richmond with her husband Robert Haase, a Sterling Heights firefighter and paramedic. Political career In March 2008, Jennifer Haase filed to run for the 32nd State House District of Michigan. The 32nd District is divided between exurban Macomb County and rural St. Clair County. It includes the Macomb County municipalities of Armada, Chesterfield, Lenox, and Richmond Townships, as well as the cities of Richmond, Memphis and New Baltimore. In St. Clair County, the 32nd encompasses Columbus, Ira, Kimball, and Wales Townships. The seat was being vacated by Republican incumbent Daniel J. Acciavatti, who was barred by term limits from running for re-election. Haase was unopposed in the Democratic Primary, while the Republican Primary featured four candidates. Republican John Accavitti won the Republican Primary and faced Haase in the General Election. Although the 32nd was historically safe Republican territory, the strong national Democratic presidential candidates made the race between Haase and Accavitti competitive. Haase defeated Accavitti in what was considered an upset. She won by a 50.4%-46.9% margin. Democrat Barack Obama won the District over Republican John McCain by a narrow 49.5%-48.6% margin, and won the presidency. The 32nd District was one of nine seats that Democrats picked up from Republicans in the 2008 election, bringing their margin in the State House to 66-44. Haase took office on January 1, 2009. She sat on the Agriculture, Health Policy, Education, and Ethics and Elections Committees. In midterm elections, Haase lost her re-election bid in 2010 to Republican Andrea LaFontaine.

Usually wearing jersey number 9, the hooker is one of the team's forwards. During scrums the hooker plays in the front row, and the position's name comes from their role of 'hooking' or 'raking' the ball back with the foot. For this reason the hooker is sometimes referred to as the rake. Anthony Mitchell usually perform the role of \\"dummy half\\", picking the ball up to start play following a play-the-ball. Hookers have a great deal of contact with the ball, as they usually play the role of acting halfback or dummy half, picking the ball up from the play-the-ball that follows a tackle. Hookers therefore have much responsibility in that they then decide what to do with the ball, whether that be to pass it (and to whom), run with it, or occasionally to kick it. Therefore, together with the two half backs and , hooker is one of the four key positions that make up what is sometimes called a team's 'spine'. A trend of s converting into hookers followed the introduction of the 10 metre rule, and many players have switched between these positions in their careers such as Geoff Toovey, Andrew Johns, Craig Gower and Peter Wallace. The laws of rugby league state that the hooker is to be numbered 9. However, in some leagues, such as Super League, players can wear jersey numbers which do not have to conform to this system. One book published in 1996 stated that in senior rugby league, the hooker and handled the ball more often than any other position. In the 2013 NRL season the top six players with the most tackles were all hookers.

Biography = Early life  Mugambi was born on 6 February 1947 at Kiangoci, Embu District, in the Eastern Province of Kenya. His father Timothy Kanyua Mugambi and mother Jemimah Koori were both committed Anglican Christians. His father, whom he describes as a person who was \\"ahead of his time,\\" was a lay leader, preacher and evangelist.  Education  After high school, Mugambi enrolled at Machakos Teacher Training College (MTTC), Kenya, in 1966‚Äì67. In 1968 he was admitted to Kenyatta College, Nairobi, to pursue further teacher training for a year, specializing in religious education and English at the high school level. He pursued further studies at Westhill College of Education, Birmingham, UK, and conducted historical research at the CMS Archives in London (1969‚Äì70). In 1971, Mugambi attended the University of Nairobi for undergraduate and postgraduate studies. In 1978 he embarked on his research for PhD, which he completed in 1983, focusing on Ludwig Wittgenstein entitled \\"Problems of Meaning in Discourse with Reference to Religion.\\"J.N.K. Mugambi, \\"Problems of Meaning in Discourse with Reference to Religion\\", (Nairobi: PhD Thesis, University of Nairobi, 1984. His main supervisor was Joseph Donders, with helpful advice from Kwasi Wiredu, who was then in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Ghana, Legon.Kwasi Wiredu, Philosophy and an African Culture, Cambridge University Press, 1980; Cultural Universals and Particulars, Indiana University Press, 1997. During this period he was invited to participate in an ecumenical research project to document the practice of ecumenism at the local level in eastern Africa. This research was published in 1982 as Ecumenical Initiatives in Eastern Africa.Jesse Mugambi, John Mutiso- Mbinda and Judith Vollbrecht, Ecumenical Initiatives in Eastern Africa, Nairobi: AACC/AMECEA, 1982.  Early career  After graduation from the University of Nairobi, Mugambi became active in the ecumenical movement. In 1970, he participated in the formation and launch of the Christian Student Council (the Kenyan SCM) and in the National Association of Religious Education Teachers (NARET).J.N.K. Mugambi, \\"African Christian Theology: A Reflection\\", in Salaam: Journal of the National Association of R.E. Teachers, Nairobi, April 1981 - Article. He later served as Africa Theology Secretary for the World Student Christian Federation (1974‚Äì76). He has also held various posts in the World Council of Churches from 1975 until today. Mugambi joined the academic staff of the University of Nairobi in 1976, and rose through the ranks to full professorship in 1993. He has taught philosophy of religion; Religion and Science; Comparative Study of Religions; Contemporary Religious Thought; Modern Trends in Christian Thought. He has also taught African Christian Theology. Later on he began teaching Phenomenology of Religion in the postgraduate syllabus.  Honors  Mugambi has had a number of visiting professorships internationally. He is a fellow of the Kenya National Academy of Sciences (FKNAS) and was conferred a national honour as an Edler of the Order of the Burning Spear (EBS) in 2010.  Academic and religious work  Early in 1990 he became widely acclaimed in Christian theological circles after he addressed the General Committee of the All Africa Conference of Churches on March 30 in Nairobi, reflecting on \\"The Future of the Church and the Church of the Future in Africa.\\"Mugambi's original Paper on the Theology of Reconstruction Paper was published in the book, The Church of Africa: Towards a Theology of Reconstruction, 1991:29-50, which Mugambi edited jointly with J.B Chipenda, A. Karamaga and C.K Omari. It also appears in his book, From liberation to reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War, (Nairobi: EAEP, 1995), 160-180 ‚Äì as chapter ten. This event was a few weeks after Nelson Mandela had been released on 11 February 1990 and Namibia had attained national independence on 21 March of the same year. In his address, Mugambi suggested that African Christianity must shift theological gear from the paradigm of liberation, which emphasised the Exodus motif, to that of reconstruction, which emphasises the post-Exilic motif. He later elaborated this insight in his book From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War.J.N.K. Mugambi, From liberation to reconstruction: African Christian theology after the cold war, (Nairobi: EAEP, 1995).  Hermeneutics  Mugambi is Africa Co-Editor of Cambridge Dictionary of Christianity, in which he has contributed more than ten articles, mainly on hermeneutics.J.N.K.

Mugambi, \\"A Critique of Method in African Christian Theology\\" in J.M. Waliggo and Mary Getui, eds., Worship in African Christianity, Nairobi: Acton, 1998 (chapter).

Mugambi and Johannes Smit, eds, Text and Context in New Testament Hermeneutics, Nairobi: Acton. (chapter). The following year he addressed a conference at Makerere University, on \\"African Hermeneutics in a Global Context\\", published in 2007 as a chapter in Interpreting Classical Religious Texts in Contemporary Africa, edited by Knut Holter.J.N.K. Mugambi, \\"African Hermeneutics in a Global Context\\", in Interpreting Classical Religious Texts in Contemporary Africa, edited by Knut Holter, Nairobi: Acton, 2007, Chapter. There is much hermeneutical discourse in Mugambi's book (co-authored with Michael R. Guy) titled Contextual Theology Across Cultures, published in 2009. Mugambi is critical of Rudolf Bultmann's project of \\"demythologisation\\", on the ground that hermeneutically, myth cannot be abstracted from the Gospel. Any attempt at 'demythologization' results in new myths. Instead of \\"demythologization\\", Mugambi urges for \\"remythologization.\\" He says of Bultmann, \\"in (his) attempt to satisfy scientific positivism by denouncing myth (he) ends up destroying the reality of religion as a pillar of culture.\\"J. N. K Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: 37. For Mugambi, as with Jaspers, \\"myth is indispensable in cultural constructions of reality.\\" To Mugambi, therefore, reconstruction in Africa has to be anchored in a) the formulation of new myths to replace the negative stereotypes used for the indoctrination of Africans under imperialism and missionary tutelage, and b) re-interpreting the old myths, for the survival of the African peoples. He suggests that the myth of \\"a vanishing people must be replaced by the myth of a resurgent, or resilient people,\\" while the myth of a \\"desperate people must be replaced by the myth of a people (who are) full of hope. The myth of a hungry people must be replaced by the myth of a people capable of feeding themselves, and so on.\\"J. N. K Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: 38.

Eco-theology  During a conference organized by the World Council of Churches Sub-Unit of Church and Society in July 1986 at Potsdam, East Germany, Mugambi presented a position paper titled \\"God, Humanity and Nature in Ecumenical Discussion\\" cautioning against too sharp a distinction between these three notions in Christian doctrine.J.N.K. Mugambi, \\"God, Humanity and Nature in Ecumenical Discussion\\", in Church and Society Report, Potsdam, July 1986, Geneva, 1986 - Position Paper. In 1987 he published his book God, Humanity and Nature in Relation to Justice and Peace, J.N.K. Mugambi, God, Humanity and Nature in Relation to Justice and Peace, Geneva: WCC, 1987. intended as a contribution to discussions within the World Council of Churches concerning the relationship between religion and culture on the one hand, and God and Nature on the other. This publication was an echo of a public forum which Mugambi had organized as an undergraduate at the University of Nairobi in 1972, with Professor Stephen Neill as Patron, on the theme \\"Creation or Evolution: God or Darwin\\". The theme of ecology became one of his research interests, and in 2001 he facilitated the editing and publication of Christian Theology and Environmental Responsibility.J.N.K. Mugambi and Mika V√§h√§kangas, eds., Christian Theology and Environmental Responsibility, Nairobi: Acton, 2001. His contribution in that book was a chapter highly critical of Carbon Dioxide emissions trading, which was being pushed for adoption within the Kyoto Protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\\"Emissions Trading as an Aspect of Toxic Waste Dumping\\", in J.N.K.

Mugambi and Mika V√§h√§kangas, ed., Christian Theology and Environmental Responsibility, Nairobi: Acton, 2001.  Inter-religious dialogue  Mugambi suggests that inter-religious dialogue has broader implications than arguments about beliefs and practices within and between religions. Believers of particular religions, denominations and sects are at the same time citizens of particular nations. Thus religious identity and secular identity are practical necessity, irrespective of idealistic and utopian expectations. In his view, inter-religious dialogue can be one of the means to promote mutual understanding within and between religions, cultures and nations, provided that such dialogue presupposes mutual respect and mutual reciprocity.J.N.K. Mugambi, \\"Prerequisites for an Effective Dialogue involving Religion and Culture\\", in Ariane Hentsch Cisneros and Shanta Pramawardhana, eds, Sharing Values: A Hermeneutics for Global Ethics, Geneva: Globethics,net, 2010, pp. 249-68.  Liberation theology  According to Rosberg and Nottingham about 75,000 Kenyans served in the British military during the Second World War.C. G. Rosberg and J. Nottingham, The Myth of Mau Mau: Nationalism in Colonial Kenya (Stanford, 1966), 191. Some went to Asia (mainly Ceylon, India and Burma), including Mugambi's father. Upon their return, much more exposed and more self-confident than the peers who had not gone to war, these veterans led the campaign for national independence. The campaign was peaceful at the beginning, but the British administrators and settlers were adamant that Kenya would remain British for ever. The British missionaries, settlers, administrators and entrepreneurs enjoyed full imperial citizenship, while Kenyans remained imperial subjects in their motherland. Mugambi started schooling as an Internally Displaced Person (IDP) in a concentration camp. The experience was traumatic, as described by Caroline Elkins, David Anderson and others.Caroline Elkins, Britain's Gulag: The Brutal End of Empire in Kenya (London: Jonathan Cape, 2005); David Anderson, Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War and the End of Empire in Kenya, New York: W.W. Norton, 2005. Despite all odds, Mugambi managed to proceed with school work and to pass all his examinations. His articulation of Liberation Theology in later years was anchored in his personal experience of imperial domination and colonial oppression. In 1989 he published a book containing his theological reflections African Christian Theology: An Introduction.J.N.K. Mugambi, African Christian Theology: An Introduction, Nairobi: Heinemann, 1989. In his 1974 essay on liberation and salvation, Mugambi had clarified that within the African context of the 1960s and 1970s liberation (from oppression, exploitation and racial prejudice) was the main preoccupation for al responsible leaders. That the fundamental concern of African Christian theology has been liberation- salvation has been manifested in the activities of many African Christians and the growth of more than six thousand \\"Independent\\" churches in the continent of Africa. Most African Christians have not felt it necessary to theorize about Christian Theology, because to them religious faith is practical living, expressed most effectively through experience, not through words. The time has come when it is necessary to analyze the premises of African Christian experience and study it in relation to that of peoples in other parts of the world. This systematic analysis and study, however, will be realistic and relevant as African Christian theology if Africans themselves will be the analysts and students of their own experience ... What is important to point out in this context is that while liberation both as a concept and as a historical struggle in Africa today takes on different emphasis in different parts of Africa, it must be the overarching goal ‚Äì the historical project‚Äî out of which and for which an African Christian theology must emerge.J.N.K. Mugambi, African Christian Theology: An Introduction, pp. 12-13.  Reconstruction theology  In Mugambi's scholarly work liberation precedes reconstruction in African Christian Theological reflection.The Following doctoral Theses have been written on Mugambi's Reconstruction Theology: Ian Ritchie, McGill University, 1992; Isaac T. Mwase, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, 1993; Stephen I. Munga, Lund University, 1998; Joern Henrik Olsen, Copenhagen University, 2000; J. Njoroge wa Ngugi, Catholic University of America, 2001; Valentin Dedji, Cambridge University, 2001; Diane B. Stinton, Edinburgh University, 2003; Elelwani B. Farisani, University of Natal Pietermaritzburg, 2003; George Fihavango, University of Erlangen, Germany, 2005, Julius Mutugi Gathogo, University Natal Pietermaritzburg, 2006; Sicily Mbura Muriithi, University of Kwazulu Natal, 2008; John Fischer, University of Western Cape, 2010. Mugambi resonates with Karl Jaspers' positive appraisal of myth in the conceptualization of world-views.Karl Jaspers, \\"Myth and Religion,\\" in Ed. Hans-Werner Bartsch, ed., Kerygma and Myth: A Theological Debate, translated by Reginald Fuller (London: SPCK, 1972), 144. Thus Mugambi proposes that, \\"a society which is incapable of making its own myths and re-interpreting its old ones, becomes extinct.\\" In view of this insight, he defines the vision of the theology of reconstruction, in Africa, as a project of \\"... re-mythologization, in which the theologian thus engaged, discerns new symbols and new metaphors in which to recast the central Message of the Gospel.\\"J. N. K Mugambi, \\"The Bible and Ecumenism in African Christianity,\\" in Hannah Kinoti and John Waliggo (eds) 1997. The Bible in African Christianity (Nairobi: Acton Publishers, 1997), 75. Mugambi joins other scholars in African Christian theology, endeavouring to authentically relate Christianity with the African cultural and religious heritage with appreciation of both the Gospel and the wisdom bequeathed from generation to generation through oral tradition, cherished customs, rituals and symbols. It appears that Mugambi's concern for Pan-African identity has support within diplomatic circles. Even though he does not treat Africa as a single geo- cultural context of theology, he nevertheless creates in his readers an impression that African concerns are broadly the same ‚Äì which is largely correct.Takatso A. Mofokeng, \\"Mission theology from an African perspective: A dialogue with David Bosch,\\" in Kritzinger, J.N.K & Saayman, W. A (eds.) 1990. Mission in creative tension: A dialogue with David Bosch (Pretoria: S.A Missiological society, 1990), 168-180. He is particularly appealing because he strictly and consistently avoids any attempt at parochial, national and regional introversion, opting for an approach that keeps in full view the entire continent of Africa with all its homogeneity and heterogeneity.J.N.K. Mugambi, African Christian Theology: An Introduction, pp. 3-7. In his books, Mugambi avoids such particularistic titles as \\"South African Christianity,\\" \\"Kenyan Christianity,\\" \\"Africa North (or South) of Limpopo,\\" \\"East African Christianity\\", etc. Rather, he is concerned with the Africans ‚Äì both in the African continent and in the Diaspora. While Mugambi acknowledges that theological articulation is strictly contextual and situational, all his works take \\"Africa\\" as the \\"Context\\" rather than the artificial territorial identities that are the result of the Partition of Africa at the Berlin Conference of 1884‚Äì85. Mugambi's book From Liberation to Reconstruction assesses events that affected Africa as a whole. These events include the end of the Cold War (1989), which divided African countries between those who were pro-West versus the pro-East - thereby causing unnecessary tensions among some neighbouring African countries. Other events include the release of Nelson Rholihlahla Mandela on 11 February 1990 after serving in prison for 27 years on Robben Island. For Mugambi, Mandela is not only the longest-serving political prisoner; he is also the most prominent symbol of the Exodus metaphor in African Christian Theology.J.N.K Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: 213.  From a theology of liberation to a theology of reconstruction  In his post-Cold-War theological discourses, which can also be regarded as his post- liberation works, Mugambi suggests that the Africa of the 21st century will have to pre-occupy itself with the agenda of reconstruction as the new priority for Africa. The text of Ezra-Nehemiah, unlike that of the Exodus, would be the main text in African theological discourses in the 21st century. This text will motivate the people of Africa to rebuild their continent from all sorts of ruins. Reconstruction is the new priority for African nations in the 1990s (and beyond). The churches and their theologians will need to respond to this new priority in relevant fashion, to facilitate this process of reconstruction. The process will require considerable efforts of reconciliation and confidence-building. It will also require re-orientation and retraining.J.N.K Mugambi, \\"The Future of the church and the church of the future in Africa\\" in eds. J.B Chipenda, A. Karamaga, J.N.K Mugambi & C.K Omari. The Church of Africa: Towards a Theology of Reconstruction (Nairobi: A.A.C.C, 1991), 36. While acknowledging that Mugambi has \\"correctly observed that an epiphany of a new scenario has emerged, ushered in by the demise of three horrendous systems of oppression; namely institutionalised racism, brutal colonialism and the cold war tutelage,\\" Ukachukwu Chris ManusUkachukwu Chris Manus, Intercultural Hermeneutics in Africa: Methods and Approaches (Nairobi: Acton, 2003), 2. considers Mugambi as having failed to recognise the central figure in the New Testament, \\"Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ himself as the Master Reconstructor of both the spiritual and the social well-being of the bnaiya Israel, the simple folk of his day in first century Palestine.\\"Ukachukwu Chris Manus, Intercultural hermeneutics in Africa: 4. Manus goes on to argue that the term \\"reconstruction\\" makes a deep impression on him as a \\"meta-language\\" that challenges African religiosity to discern and promote new insights that can inspire a new movement that would help to galvanise Africans in the continent like those in the Diaspora to struggle and regain their integrity.Ukachukwu Chris Manus, Intercultural hermeneutics in Africa: 2. For Manus, therefore, the goal of reconstruction ought to be pursued in order to re-capture Africa's self-esteem, dignity and integrity, \\"in the context of new Information and Communication Technology.\\"Ukachukwu Chris Manus, Intercultural hermeneutics in Africa: 6. Others have offered perspectives on Mugambi's views on liberation and reconstruction. In attempting a definition, Hannah Wangeci Kinoti explained that the idea of reconstruction assumes that there is a framework which was previously there. She went on to say that \\"a cluster of words associated with the verb reconstruct should quicken our vision of asking the Church in African to rise up and do more, purposefully and decisively.\\"Hannah Wangeci Kinoti, \\"The Church in the Reconstruction of our moral self,\\" in J. N. K. Mugambi ed. 1997, The Church and Reconstruction of Africa: Theological Considerations (Nairobi: All Africa Conference of Churches, 1997), 115. She suggested that the concept of reconstruction implies a process of \\"review and then move\\" - to create something more suitable to the prevailing environment.Hannah Wangeci Kinoti, \\"The Church in the Reconstruction of our moral self\\": 115. Other terms can be invoked: rebuild, reassemble, re-establish, recreate, reform, renovate, regenerate, remake, remodel, restore, or re-organise.

Robert David Lion Gardiner inherited the property in the 1930 and allowed the newly created Sagtikos Manor Historical Society to use the property in 1964. In 2012 the Historical Society sued the Robert David Lion Gardiner Foundation. They argued that Gardiner had intended that part of his estate should go to support the maintenance of the property. However, since his will did not specifically name the Society, the courts ruled the Society did not have standing, could not even request an audit of the Foundation's finances.

Plot In 1878 in the south west of the US, Ben Nicholson is the richest rancher of the area. A tough man who strikes a hard bargain, he has been outwitted by his second wife Katherine, a flirtatious intriguer. Of his two sons from the previous marriage, Frank is gay and the unfortunate David is a half-wit. There is a third son in the house however, born from the black cook Marpessa, who acts as butler: this is Whity. Despite his capability, Whity gets humiliated and whipped. His only hope of any decency lies in his friendship with the town's saloon singer and whore, Hanna. She has landed a job back in the east and offers to take Whity with her, but he says he must stay with his family. To trap Katherine, Ben arranges for a Mexican called Garcia to pretend he is a physician and to seduce her, confiding to her that Ben has not long to live. The plot succeeds but, rather than pay what he promised, Ben kills Garcia. When he learns that Hanna witnessed the murder, he pays her for her silence. Excited by the prospect of inheriting the ranch, both Frank and Katherine try to get Whity to kill Ben.

It is the largest standing stone in Brittany and is over 9 meters high. Location The Menhir du Champ-Dolent is 2 kilometres (1 mile) south of Dol-de-Bretagne in the department of Ille-et-Vilaine. It is in a small picnic area fenced off among the fields near the D795 road. Description The menhir is the tallest of Brittany's standing stones. Its height above ground is between 9.3 and 9.5 metres (about 31 feet). It is made of pinkish granite, quarried about away, and has an estimated weight of around 100 tonnes. It is oval in shape with a smooth surface. A cross was once placed on top to Christianize it. It is not precisely dated, but recent scholarship suggests that Brittany's menhirs were erected c. 5000‚Äì4000 BC. It has been registered as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1889. Minist√®re de la culture, Inventaire G√©n√©ral du patrimoine culturel, notice on \\"Menhir de Champ Dolent\\", 2003. In folklore According to legend, the menhir fell from the skies to separate two feuding brothers who were on the point of killing each other. This legend is said to account for the name \\"Champ Dolent\\" which means \\"Field of Sorrow\\". In reality, the word dolent is more likely to derive from Breton dolenn (\\"meadow\\"). Another legend states that the menhir is slowly sinking into the ground, and the world will end when it disappears altogether. According to tradition, in the year 560 Chlothar I, King of the Franks, is said to have met his rebel son, Chram, here.

Its importance in architectural terms is further enhanced as it is believed to be the earliest known British building of cross-axial form.\\" History of the building The tower, as depicted on a map from 1610 Since at least the Middle Ages, a hall has stood on this site by the warm spring for which Buxton water is known.

The inscription can still be seen in the window of room 26. The Hall was rebuilt by one of Bess of Hardwick's descendants, the first Duke of Devonshire, in 1670. Use as a hotel By 1727, the Old Hall had become a hotel, the only one in Buxton, where the writer Daniel Defoe stayed on his tour of Great Britain. Of the Hall he wrote: \\"The Duke of Devonshire ... has built a large handsome house at the bath, where there is convenient lodging, and very good provisions, and an ordinary well served for one shilling per head; but it is but one.\\" By the time that the nearby Georgian Crescent was built (1780‚Äì86), Buxton had become an established spa town; and the Old Hall had become a fashionable hotel for the Georgian aristocracy taking the waters. In 1791 one James Cumming (father of the noted chemist James Cumming) leased what was then called Buxton Hall Hotel from the fifth Duke in 1791. He was considered socially more than a mere hotelier, and the hotel's clientele included bishops and visiting aristocracy. The Old Hall has served as a hotel ever since.

Chronologically, it is composed of five interconnected novels, namely Po-on (written in 1984), Tree (written in 1978), My Brother, My Executioner (written in 1973), The Pretenders (written in 1962), and Mass (written in 1973).Yoser, Elizabeth G.

The Rosales Novels, The Star-entangled Banner: One Hundred Years of America in the Philippines, books.google.com Jos√© begun writing the series in 1962 and completed it in 1984. General description All of Jos√©‚Äôs five novels are in set in Rosales, Pangasinan in Luzon, Philippines. Jos√© uses a variation of styles for the novels. Jos√© also focuses on different families with different social statuses. The object that connects and binds these families is the ‚Äúgiant Balete tree\\" located at the plaza of Rosales town. Among the common themes in the Rosales Novels are the intimate relationships and marriages between cousins, the father figure who is beaten up by the political and social structures, vengeful and aggressive attacks on persons who symbolize the repression and subjugation, the love-hate relationship between the characters and the town of Rosales, as well as its barrios such as Cabugawan, Carmay and Sipnget. Narrative sequence=Po- on The first book in the Rosales series, Po-on, focuses on the Samson family. The novel is set during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War when revolution and nationalism were presented as the solution to the social and political problems in the Philippines. Tree The second novel,Tree, pursues the life of the unnamed grandson of Don Jacinto, the overseer of the Asperris and protector of the Samsons in Po-on. The unnamed narrator witnesses the adversity of the Filipino peasants under the encomienda system during the Spanish colonial regime, as well as the resulting uprisings created by the peasants. However, the nameless story-teller is unable to free himself from his own position that carries cultural and economic benefits. The succeeding three books after Tree reinforce the existing strain between Philippine colonial heritage and bona fide patriotism. My Brother, My Executioner The third novel, My Brother, My Executioner, concentrates on the life of Luis Asperri and his half-brother Victor during the 1950s, a time that was plagued with the Hukbalahap rebellion. Luis Asperri is the illegitimate son of Don Vicente Asperri. Don Asperri takes Luis Asperri as an heir due to the absence of a legitimate son by the former. Luis abandons his peasant roots in order to embrace the status of a landowner. His half-brother Victor warns Luis that if the peasantry does not receive economic justice, the Hukbalahap insurgents would annihilate the elite class. In the end, Luis expects his demise at the hands of the Hukbalahap rebels. The Pretenders The fourth novel, The Pretenders, recalls the life of Antonio ‚ÄúTony‚Äù Samson, the son of Victor, the half-brother of Luis Asperri in My Brother, My Executioner (Victor was imprisoned for life for murdering Luis Asperri). Antonio Samson obtains a PhD degree from Harvard University in the United States. By marrying a rich Filipina mestiza, Antonio Samson becomes an Ilustrado and works for his father-in-law. As a result, Antonio Samson is unable to marry his true love and cousin, Emy, with whom he sired an illegitimate son. Feeling undeserving of Emy and his son because of his denunciation of his peasant origins, Antonio Samson commits suicide. Mass In the fifth and last Rosales Novel, Mass, the timeline jumps forward into the 1970s, to narrate the life of Pepe Samson, the illegitimate son of Antonio Samson and his cousin Emy. Pepe Samson moves to Manila to attend college. He becomes a member of a revolutionary group called The Brotherhood. The novel ends with a scene with Pepe leaving Manila to adhere to the cause of the mountain guerrillas. Connection with Viajero In Jos√©‚Äôs separate novel Viajero, which is not a part of the Rosales Saga series, Pepe Samson reappears as a full-fledged insurgent, while some other Rosales Novels characters also resurface.

It was first described in 1868 by the Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker, who gave it the name Rhombotides polyzona; it was later transferred to the genus Acanthurus, becoming Acanthurus polyzona. Description Acanthurus polyzona is a laterally flattened fish, roughly the shape of an almond, and can grow to a length of about . The head is short with a pointed snout and a terminal mouth with thick lips. The eyes are large and the two pairs of nostrils are immediately in front of the eyes. The overall colour of this fish is a very pale yellow, rather more olive-grey dorsally and more silvery-white ventrally. Superimposed on this pale background are nine broad black bands, narrowing slightly towards the belly; the first band passes through the eye, the second extends from the front of the dorsal fin to the base of the pectoral fins, and the eight and ninth bands are on the caudal peduncle. On either side of the peduncle is a small, retractable spine. The only fish with which it is likely to be confused is the \\"convict tang\\" (Acanthurus triostegus); that species has a yellower background colour and just six vertical, rather more slender black bands. It is more widely distributed, and even within the zebra tang's restricted range, the convict tang is the common of the two. Distribution Acanthurus polyzona has a rather restricted distribution in the tropical western Indian Ocean, its range including Madagascar, Mauritius, R√©union and the Comoro Islands. It lives in shallow reef habitats, in lagoons and on outer reef slopes, over sandy, rocky or coral seabeds at depths down to about . Ecology The zebra tang is diurnal and feeds on algae, especially filamentous algae. It often associates with shoals of convict tangs, taking advantage of the protection given by numbers. The juveniles, which are similar to the adults in markings but rather more elongated, associate with young convict tangs. The reproduction of this fish has not been studied, however the growth rate of young fish is fast so that there may be a doubling of a population in as little as 15 months.

By age 10, Micrander was a student at Uppsala University. At age 28, he was studying for a master's degree with the De educatione liberorum. In 1687, Micrander received his second professorship in theology. In 1676, Micrander was appointed as extraordinary professor of Greek, becoming a professor the next year. In 1685, university Chancellor Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie (1622‚Äì1686) appointed Micrander professor of theology. Micrander was ordained as a priest in the Church of Sweden and became vicar of [Vaksala Church in Uppsala . He became involved in the Cartesian controversy at the university. Orthodox Aristotelian supporters, such as Micrander, believed that Rene Descartes philosophy threatened the purity of the Christian faith. Micrander was influenced by the German theologian Johann Adam Osiander (1622-1697) and published his strongly anti-Cartesian Collegium theologicum in pr√¶cipuas Controversies theo Logica habitum Olim in Sweden during 1690.

History The castle was built around 1120 by Saif al-Mulk ibn Amrun, and was sold to the Isma'ilis 1138 by his son Musa. It served as the base of the Chief Da'i of Syria Abu Muhammad.http://www.alamut.com/subj/ideologies/alamut/mirza-Sinan.html Rashid ad-Din Sinan, the leader of the Isma'ili sect in Syria, used this castle initially as his base and hermitage. Sinan eventually died and was buried there in 1193. In 1197 the Regent of Jerusalem, Henry II, Count of Champagne, visited the castle to secure an alliance with Sinan's successor. The castle was the last Isma'ili stronghold in Syria to surrender to the Mamluks. Sultan Baibars finally captured it in 1273, and it remained in use until Ottoman times, when it served at times as a prison for important personages. The castle was finally destroyed in 1816 by Mustafa Agha Barbar, the Ottoman governor of Tripoli. Overview The castle sits on a ridge between two gorges. The only entrance to the castle runs along a narrow path halfway down the steep northern slope. The general direction of the castle is east-west, running along the spur of rock on which it was built. The castle is divided into three, or possibly four, main sections. At the west end lies a long flat section. The section is clear of any buildings, except the outer walls and a bastion at the end. From the outer bailey the ground rises up towards the central citadel and fortifications. These buildings probably contained living quarters, storerooms and the water storage area with seven cisterns.

This unofficial \\"State Shinto\\" was thought by Allies to have been a major contributor to Japan's nationalistic and militant culture that led to World War II. The purpose of the directive was ostensibly based in ideas of freedom of religion and separation of church and state. History After the Second World War, it was generally understood by Allied students of Japanese culture and religion that Shinto in the form it took leading up to and during the war was social propaganda and was used as a tool of ultra-nationalism and a disguise for militarism. However, even though this support of Shinto was defined as non-religious propaganda, in the Allied schools it was being taught as religious in nature. Thus, it was US policy regarding post-surrender Japan to abolish \\"State Shinto,\\" which was not and never had been a formal Imperial policy. The directive, SCAPIN 448, was drafted by the US Military‚Äôs expert on Japanese culture and religion, Lieutenant William K. Bunce, U.S.N.R.Washington Post and was issued on December 15, 1945 with the full title of \\"Abolition of Governmental Sponsorship, Support, Perpetuation, Control, and Dissemination of State Shinto (Kokka Shinto, Jinja Shinto)\\".GHQ of the Allied Powers (1960). Translations and Official Documents: The Shinto Directive, Contemporary Religions in Japan 1 (2), 85-89 There were two translations given for the term \\"State Shinto\\": the first (\\"Kokka Shinto\\") was a neologism, and the second (\\"Jinja Shinto\\") referred to Shinto shrines, which up until 1945 had been secular wards of the state.Univie.ac.at According to the directive, State Shinto was to be stripped of public support and of its \\"ultra-nationalistic and militaristic\\" trappings. With the severing of its traditional state patronage the Shinto establishment required privatization, and to that end any Shinto entity that had been dependent on public funding but not actually part of the secular administrative structure was to be assimilated either into what the directive calls \\"Sect Shinto\\" with no special privileges above the other popular faiths, or to be reformed, with conditions stipulating complete and permanent loss of government support, as \\"Shrine Shinto,\\" which was to be supported by voluntary private donation only. No public funds whatsoever could therefore be used to support Shinto shrines or priests in any manner, nor any other entities that were at all associated with the Shinto religion. Public officials whose duties were in any way directly connected to Shinto religion were immediately to be terminated from office and their positions extinguished. Under the directive, Japan's Emperor could no longer report on public matters to his ancestors in official visits to the shrines. Instead, he was permitted to worship only non-officially and as a private individual, as were all government officials permitted to do. Any educational material considered to convey \\"Shinto doctrine\\" was to be categorically censored out of school textbooks, along with any content that at all suggested any positive effects of or justification for any of Japan's military actions in past wars. Public officials alike were forbidden any mention of anything that could be construed as being in any way religious, let alone Shinto, while performing duties in their official capacities. This was meant to stop the propagation of supposed \\"militaristic and ultra-nationalistic ideology\\" in particular, which was especially proscribed if conveyed in connection with Shinto or any other creed. These three alleged doctrines were specifically banned: (1) that the Emperor is superior to other rulers because he is descended of the sun goddess Amaterasu; (2) that the Japanese people are inherently superior to other peoples by their special ancestry or heritage, or (3) that the Japanese islands are spiritually superior to other lands, being specially blessed by the goddess Amaterasu. As a result of the directive, a stream of instructions from the government was issued covering a wide range of prohibitions concerning Japanese culture and rites. Pupils at state schools and children of pre-school age were prohibited from being taken on field trips to religious institutions; local town committees were prohibited from fundraising for shrines; groundbreaking (jichinsai) and roof-raising rites (j≈çt≈çsai) were not to be performed for public buildings; state and public bodies were prohibited from conducting funerals and rites of propitiation for the war dead; and the removal and/or erection of commemorative sites to the war dead were regulated by the directive. However, the directive was lenient towards imperial court rites. Initially, the directive was rigidly applied. This led to numerous complaints and grievances from local people. In 1949, halfway through the occupation, the directive came to be applied with greater discretion. Typical of this leniency was the approval granted to state funerals which entailed religious rites, such as those of Tsuneo Matsudaira of the Upper House (Shint≈ç-style) and of Kij≈´r≈ç Shidehara of the Lower House (Buddhist).Eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp Legacy The Directive had a dramatic impact on postwar Japanese policy. Although it was only enforced by the GHQ, many of the changes it made became a part of a revised postwar legal interpretation of separation of religion and state. The only notable reversion, besides the Occupation-era approval of state funerals, was a 1965 Supreme Court decision approving of jichinsai and j≈çt≈çsai for public buildings.Carl F. Goodman, The Rule of Law in Japan (Fredrick, MD: Kluwer Law International, 2008), 76-78 Shinto remains one of the most popular religions in Japan. Some groups, such as the fundamentalist shinto lobby Shinto Seiji Renmei Kokkai Giin KondankaiJapanfocus.org, want to restore Shinto as a state religion to encourage more traditional Japanese lifestyles. This includes Shinz≈ç Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan, who is a proponent of the re-institution of state- Shintoism and the imperial worship.

In October 2013 the Coventry- based company was ranked as the seventh largest supplier in the UK, making it the largest outside the Big Six. By September 2014 the company had a market share of 2% and in March 2019 it had 700,000 customers. The company does not generate electricity, instead purchasing it from international markets. The company had a relationship with Shell, where it acted as an intermediary to purchase wholesale energy on the global market. Shell reached an agreement to purchase the company in December 2017, and completed the acquisition in February 2018. Rebranding to Shell Energy took place in March 2019 and the business now forms part of Shell's New Energies division. History alt= The company was launched in 2008 by co-founders Mark Daeche, Darren Braham and Marcus Citron as a spin-out from First Telecom. In January 2012, the company appointed the former lastminute.com CEO Ian McCaig as its new CEO. In January 2014, the company signed a three-year deal to become title sponsors of the Super League. In September 2014, the firm announced it was considering an initial public offering or outside investment to fund foreign expansion. In September 2015, the company announced an expansion into Germany to be branded as Shell. In September 2015, Reuters reported that First Utility had doubled customer numbers in three of the last four years, adding 275,000 customers in the year to July 2015. Shell reached an agreement to buy the company in December 2017, and the deal was completed on 28 February 2018. In March 2019, the company announced all customers would be supplied with electricity from 100% renewable sources. First Utility offered Internet access service, bundled with line rental and phone calls, and this was continued under the Shell Energy brand.  Acquisitions  In October 2019, Shell Energy agreed the ¬£10.5m purchase of the customers of Green Star Energy, a brand of Canada's Just Energy. Green Star had around 200,000 residential gas and electricity customers. Technology Being a small new entrant to the market allowed the company to experiment with new technology without the burden of having to migrate large numbers of customers from legacy systems. The company was the first in the UK to offer smart meters to its residential customers. This also gave the company experience of a large smart meter roll-out programme. The company has partnered with various other providers including oPower and Google PowerMeter to provide customers with access to usage data. Customer relations Ofgem issued a disciplinary order against the company in December 2010 for failing to protect vulnerable customers. In April 2012 the new chief executive Ian McCaig said: Criticism In 2014, the company received criticism for the tone of its energy saving advice. When it was reported that shadow Energy Minister Tom Greatrex had said the advice was an \\"insult\\" to millions of people, the company's reported response was that \\"These tips are meant to provide some advice on how we might reduce our energy usage and absolutely not intended to trivialise the issue of fuel poverty, something we take very seriously.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Electric power companies of the United Kingdom Category:Energy companies established in 2008 Category:Utilities of the United Kingdom ","title":"Shell Energy"},{"id":"26554315","text":"Acanthurus reversus is a tropical fish found in coral reefs in the Marquesas Islands.Acanthurus reversus at www.fishbase.org.

Personal life Anton was married to H√©l√®ne Boniface Pauline Luise Gr√§fin von Hatzfeldt zu Trachenberg (1847‚Äì1931), a daughter of Pauline de Castellane and Count Max von Hatzfeldt, who spent ten years from 1849 to 1859 as the German Minister to France and who signed the Treaty of Paris in 1856 which ended the Crimean War. After her father's death, her mother remarried to Louis de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, duc de Valen√ßay, 3rd duc de Talleyrand-P√©rigord. Her younger sister, Margarete, was the wife of the German diplomat Anton Saurma von der Jeltsch.

The founders of the Benzelius family were Henrik Jacobsson, farmer and juror, and his wife Margareta J√∂nsdotter. Henrik Jacobsson was from, according to contemporary records, in Kalix, and the wife from Lule√•. Henrik Jacobsson was born on the island of Hinders√∂n in the archipelago of Lule√•, where he was until 1629 a farmer before he moved to Bensbyn, through either marriage or inheritance. His father Jacob Henriksson died early. His widow Barbro Eriksdotter later married a farmer from Nederkalix but her son Olof Persson was the product of her third marriage. Henrik Jacobsson's paternal grandfather of the same name was the landk√∂pman [ \\"country merchant\\" ] and farmer at the farm in Hinders√∂n, and his great-grandfather Jakob J√∂nsson had also been a farmer at the same farm. Margareta J√∂nsdotter was probably the one that had the right of inheritance of the estate in Bensbyn, and she was in that case the daughter of the farmer J√∂ns Larsson, who was a member of the Birkarls, a Finnish group that controlled commerce and taxes. Henrik Jacobsson and Margareta J√∂nsdotter had several children. Their son Jacob became an indelta soldater [ \\"tenement soldier\\" ] for his father and got his own farm. The couple also had at least two daughters, daughter Anna, who with her husband took over the farm in Bensbyn, and Mariet or Margareta who married a knekt [ \\"foot soldier\\" ] in Lule√•. Margaret was called Benzelia in the records of the town hall of Lule√•. A possible third sister married in Uppsala the alderman Peder Pedersson, who was said to be Margaret Benzelias's son-in-law . The second son of Henrik Jacobsson and Margareta J√∂nsdotter was Erik who adopted the name of Benzelius. He was raised by his wealthy and childless half - uncle Olof Persson in Uppsala, cited above, and adopted the Latin name Benzelius in honor of his birthplace when he enrolled at Uppsala University. Erik Benzelius later became the 46th Archbishop of Uppsala. He married Margareta Odhelia, the daughter of Professor Erik Odhelius ( 1620‚Äì1666 ) and Margaretha Kenicia, the granddaughter of the 40th Archbishop of Uppsala Petrus Kenicius ( 1555‚Äì1636 ) from the Bure dynasty and, according to Gabriel Anrep, through the Archbishop's father, the descendant of the old nobility of V√§sterg√∂tland. The couple had ten children. Three sons became the 50th, 51st and 52nd Archbishops of Uppsala, namely Erik Benzelius the Younger ( 1743‚Äì1744 ), Jakob Benzelius ( 1744‚Äì1747 ), and Henrik Benzelius ( 1747‚Äì1758 ). The children who had not entered the Church were ennobled as knights with the name of Benzelstierna. The other sons and their descendants continued to use the name of Benzelius. Erik Benzelius the younger was, through his marriage with Bishop Jesper Svedberg's daughter Anna Swedenborg, the brother-in-law of Emanuel Swedenborg. Their son Carl Jesper Benzelius became the Bishop of Str√§ngn√§s, the daughter Ulrika married the 22nd Lutheran Bishop of Link√∂ping, Petrus Filenius ( 1704‚Äì1780 ), and all of their sons took the name of Benzelstierna in Riddarhuset [ \\"House of Nobility\\" ]. Jakob Benzelius was, with his marriage with Katarina Edenberg, the father of Margareta Benzelstjerna, the ancestress of the noble family of von Engestr√∂m, and of the Secretary of State Mathias Benzelstierna ( 1713‚Äì1791 ). Henrik Benzelius married Emerentia Rudensch√∂ld, daughter of Torsten Rudeen ( 1661‚Äì1729 ), the 18th Lutheran Bishop of Link√∂ping. Of the daughters of Erik Benzelius the elder, Margaret married professor Olaus Nezelius ( 1638‚Äì1710 ), the Bishop of Gothenburg, and Kristina became the ancestress of the noble family of Bergenskj√∂ld.

In 1987, at an exhibition in Moscow at VDNKh All-Russian Exhibition Centre one of Galina's works gained a medal. Soon some paintings were purchased by The Vladimir-Suzdal state historical, architectural and art museum-reserve. In 1987, Galina Kakovkina with friends established the creative association \\"Cherny Prud\\". In 1990, Galina Kakovkina took part in big projects \\"Drugoe pokolenie\\" (\\"Other generation\\") and \\"Drugoe pokolenie-2\\" (\\"Other generation-2\\"), that gathered the best artists from the Volga region, whose creative work was out of the system of \\"socialistic realism\\". Authors of the project were Lubov Saprykina and Anna Gor (art directors of the \\"Caryatid\\" gallery, later of the Nizhny Novgorod branch of the State Centre for Contemporary Art). Exhibitions took place in Moscow (Central House of Artist), Nizhny Novgorod (Nizhny Novgorod State Art Museum). Galina Kakovkina, Light.

Galina Kakovkina, Road across the Hills, 2007 In 1998, Nizhny Novgorod Exhibition Center held Galina's personal exhibition \\"Light.

On her canvases rendered in a very dark scale of colors, light is presented by rare and very bright patches ‚Äì flashes of hope in the world of shades. In 1999, Nizhny Novgorod State Art Museum presented an exhibition named \\"Composition with the Road\\", where Galina continued the theme of roads, initiated in ‚ÄúWalk in the Garden‚Äù. The theme of a way was the most full and deeply developed in \\"The Way Home\\" project (Nizhny Novgorod State Art Museum, 2008). In 2010, Galina Kakovkina presented the exhibition project \\"Boat\\" after more than two years of intensive preliminary work. In this project the artist considered semantic components of such concepts as the Boat, Water, the Vessel. The boat as an image performs an archetype and generates variety of associations and hints. Therefore, the artist uses many of them for the fullest disclosing of a boat theme ‚Äì as rescue means, as dwelling, as a vessel and as a ritually-ceremonial symbol of transition in other world.

It stars Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis. Rick and Fred, two husbands who are having difficulty in their marriages, are given hall passes by their wives: for one week, they are allowed to have sex with other women. It was theatrically released on February 25, 2011. The film received mixed critical reviews and was a moderate box office success by grossing over $83 million. Plot Best friends Rick and Fred are in stagnant marriages with their wives, Grace and Maggie. Rick and Fred miss their single days, so Grace and Maggie give them a \\"hall pass\\": a week during which they can have sex with other women. Rick and Fred try to pick up women with their friends Gary, Flats and Hog Head, while Maggie and Grace decide they should get hall passes, too On day one of hall pass week, Rick and Fred decide to eat before going to a local bar, but become too tired to stay. On day two, they eat hash brownies and play golf, but get too high and wreak havoc on the golf course. On day three, Rick and Fred go to a bar with their friends, but fail to impress the women there. They get drunk to loosen up, but wind up getting into a bar fight. They spend day four suffering from hangovers. On day five, Rick goes to a coffee shop, where he flirts with an attractive waitress named Leigh, angering her co-worker Brent, who wants her for himself. Rick and Leigh later meet at a gym, and Leigh invites Rick for a beer after they work out. Rick falls asleep in the hot tub for several hours, leaving his muscles too weak to use; two naked men have to help him leave. Meanwhile, Grace and Gerry get closer, while Maggie finds herself attracted to Gerry's coach. On day six, Rick and Fred go to a bar with their womanizing friend Coakley, where Rick meets his children's babysitter Paige, who has just turned 21 and is partying with her aunt Meg. Paige is attracted to Rick, but he shoots her down to dance with Leigh. Later, Rick parties at Coakley's while Fred takes a girl to his hotel room. However, she feels sick, and after a minor incident in the bathroom, is sent back home by Fred before they can have sex. Later that evening, Meg shows up at the room and mistakes Fred for Rick, eventually seducing him. Meanwhile, Gerry's coach tries to seduce Maggie, but she rebuffs him. Grace, on the other hand, has sex with Gerry, but tells him she can't see him again; he agrees, saying she is too old for him. On her way back home, she feels guilty about cheating on Fred and has a car accident. At Coakley's house, Leigh offers Rick casual sex. To his own surprise, Rick turns her down, saying he loves Maggie too much to cheat on her. After answering Fred's phone, Rick learns of Grace's accident and goes to the hotel to tell him. In the lobby he finds Paige, who thinks he was having sex with Meg. They enter the room and find Fred having sex with her. After finding out the truth, Meg kicks Fred in the face. Upon hearing about Grace's accident, Fred tries to go to the hospital, but finds Brent vandalizing what he thinks is Rick's car. Upon seeing Meg, his mother, at the hotel, Brent thinks Fred has had sex with her and tries to kill him, but Paige and Meg tackle him. Rick and Fred go to the hospital with Brent and the police in pursuit. At the hospital, Brent is arrested for attacking them. Rick goes home to Maggie. He tells her he did not use the hall pass, and confesses that she is the only woman he has ever been with. Moved, Maggie tells him she did not use her hall pass either, and they reconcile and have sex for the first time in months. Fred and Grace also reconcile and decide to hide their cheating from one another. However, Fred ultimately confesses that he had sex with Meg when Grace asks him to take her to see Kathy Griffin. During the credits, Fred hosts a barbecue where he pays Kathy Griffin to be present. Gary's wife suggests that she give him a hall pass. Gary fantasizes about sleeping with a married woman, and then being forced to kill her, her entire family and several bystanders, and being raped in prison; he then agrees to \\"give it a whirl\\".

Owen Wilson was the first of the two leads to commit to the project; Sudeikis was the Farrelly brothers' choice for the other lead role, but as of January 2010 it was still uncertain whether his commitment to his work on Saturday Night Live permitted his participation. Principal photography began in February 2010 in Atlanta, with Christina Applegate, Alyssa Milano, Larry Campbell and Vanessa Angel as late additions to the cast. Although filmed in Georgia, the film's setting, like most Farrelly brothers films, is New England; specifically Providence, Rhode Island. Georgia was chosen due to incentives introduced by the Georgia Entertainment Industry Investment Act of 2008; according to the Film, Music and Digital Entertainment Division of the Georgia Department of Economic Development, Hall Pass was part of Hollywood's nearly one billion outlay in the state during 2010; Marc Fischer, an executive producer of Hall Pass, called Atlanta both more economical and easier to shoot in than Boston. Fischer, also an executive producer for the Farrelly brothers' The Three Stooges, had by May 2010 already begun pre-production work in Georgia for that film. Amanda Bynes was originally set to star in the film, but was replaced by Alexandra Daddario shortly after filming began. Bynes later admitted she pulled out of the production due her now well-known substance abuse and mental health issues. Hall Pass is the third film in which Jason Sudeikis and Christina Applegate starred together, the others being The Rocker and Going the Distance. Reception=Box office Hall Pass was #1 on opening day with $4.6 million, and initial estimates showed it at #2 for the weekend behind Gnomeo & Juliet, but Gnomeo & Juliet was overestimated and brought down to #2, putting Hall Pass in first with $13.5 million in its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $45 million in North America and $38.2 million in other territories to a total of $83.2 million worldwide against a budget of $36 million. Critical response  On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 33% based on 172 reviews and an average rating of 4.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Some filmgoers may be surprised by the Farrellys' defense of traditional domestic values in Hall Pass ‚Äì unfortunately, they'll probably also be dismayed by the absence of laughs.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 45 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half out of four stars, saying, \\"A problem with Hall Pass, I think, is that both Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis are affable, and the movie wants us to like them. It is often more useful for a comedy to have characters whose embarrassment we enjoy.\\" Charlie Lyne's UltraCulture film blog said that the film's biggest problem wasn't its attitude to women (although that was brought into question), but its \\"disguising of an inherently conservative movie as some kind of anything-goes frat house sex romp.\\" \\"[W]e‚Äôre supposed to cheer on both attitudes with equal vigour and that simply doesn‚Äôt work when the film flits between them with such frequency.\\" British newspaper The Telegraph named Hall Pass one of the ten worst films of 2011, saying, \\"Hall Pass is outright hideous and also embarrassing, like a creepy uncle sporting a backwards baseball cap and cracking bad, lewd jokes for the under-thirties. At a funeral.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * * Category:2011 films Category:2010s buddy comedy films Category:2010s romantic comedy films Category:2010s sex comedy films Category:Adultery in films Category:American buddy comedy films Category:American films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American sex comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by the Farrelly brothers Category:Films set in Rhode Island Category:Films shot in Atlanta Category:Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:New Line Cinema films Category:Providence, Rhode Island Category:Films with screenplays by the Farrelly brothers Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Films scored by Rolfe Kent Category:2011 comedy films ","title":"Hall Pass"},{"id":"26554454","text":"Ten Tiny Love Stories is a 2001 drama film directed by Rodrigo Garc√≠a and starring Lisa Gay Hamilton and Radha Mitchell.

The galaxy is located at the distance of about 420 kpc from the Sun and moves away from the Sun with the velocity of about 35 km/s. The velocity with respect to the Milky Way is around ‚àí60 km/s implying a slow infall onto the Milky Way. Leo T is classified as a transitional object ('T' in the name) between dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) and dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrr). Its half-light radius is about 180 pc. Leo T is one of the smallest and faintest galaxies in the Local Group‚Äîits integrated luminosity is about 40,000 times that of the Sun (absolute visible magnitude of about ‚àí7.1). However, its mass is about 8 million solar masses, which means that Leo's mass to light ratio is around 140. A high mass to light ratio implies that Leo T is dominated by dark matter. Neutral hydrogen and star formation The stellar population of Leo T consists of both old and young stars. The old stars probably formed from 12 to 6 billion years ago. The metallicity of these old stars is very low at , which means that they contain 100 times less heavy elements than the Sun. The observed old stars are primarily red giants, although a number of horizontal branch stars and red clump stars were also discovered. After a pause star formation activity resumed about 1 billion years ago resulting in a generation of blue young stars. These young stars, which comprise only about 10% of all stellar mass, appear to be more concentrated at the center of Leo T than the old population. Currently there is no star formation in this galaxy. Leo T contains significant amount of neutral hydrogen (HI) gas with the mass of about 2.8 solar masses, which is three times more than the mass of the stars in this galaxy. The gas includes two main components: cool gas in the center of the galaxy with a temperature of about 500 K and warm gas distributed throughout Leo T with a temperature of 6,000 K. The density of this gas is, however, not enough on average for star formation, which indicates that local processes have a role. Still the presence of hydrogen gas implies that in the future the galaxy will begin forming stars again. Leo T galaxy may have formed when a small dark matter halo started accretion of gas some time after the reionization epoch. Later this gas gave birth to the first generation of old stars.

Biography Tobias and the Angel from the Book of Tobit. Waterloo is thought to have been born at Ryssel near Lille (located in what is now part of northern France). His mother was Magdalena VaillantMagdalena Vaillant was probably related to Wallerant Vaillant, who like Anthonie, was also born in Lille and later moved to Amsterdam. who became a member of the Walloon church in Amsterdam in 1621, followed by his own membership in 1630.RKD entry for Antonie Waterloo Little is known of his early life and, as no records of any formal training as an artist have been discovered, he may well have been self-taught. Although registered as a painter, he had little success in selling his own canvases and, apparently, supported himself through his activities as an art dealer in addition to sales of his drawings and prints. In 1640 he married in Amsterdam, and in 1653 he left the church and moved to Leeuwarden, but in 1654 he buried a daughter in Amsterdam before moving to Maarssen in 1655 where he lived until 1676. According to Houbraken he was good friends with Jan Weenix who told Houbraken that he knew him for 45 years and often visited him in his house between Maarssen and Breukelen where he lived as a bachelor, to decorate his landscape paintings with animals and other objects.Antonie Waterloo biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Houbraken found his landscapes very natural, and liked his manner of painting reflections in water. Waterloo was among the first artists to have established a reputation almost entirely based upon his work as a draftsman. Oil paintings by Waterloo are relatively scarce, but his many drawings of forest scenes and other topographical views are found in collections in Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Vienna, Amsterdam, and London. The 1931 catalogue of drawings, for instance lists 29 examples of Waterloo drawings. A landscape artist, Waterloo also produced many etchings which increased his popularity and extended his influence into the next century and beyond to the French Barbizon painters of the mid-19th century. While many of Waterloo's larger etchings and drawings (some almost the size of his paintings) are careful in their depiction of the smallest, individual detail, his smaller drawings of mountain valley views often feature an impressionistic group of forms as atmospheric perspective leads the eye into the hilly distance along a characteristically Baroque zig- zag course.Mountain Valley Landscape which in 2009 entered the collection of Columbia Museum of Art in South Carolina Such drawings may have been known to the English landscape etcher John Robert Cozens and, in turn, may have had a stylistic impact upon the young J.M.W. Turner. His art dealership exposed him to the work of a number of respected contemporary landscape artists such as Jacob van Ruisdael, Simon de Vlieger, Roelant Roghman, and Caesar van Everdingen, from whom he absorbed a variety of influences. Judging from the locales depicted in his drawings, he traveled widely and his trips to Germany, Switzerland, France, Poland. and even Italy have since been theorized. In Germany, he made a trip along the Rhine river, and visited various towns such as Kleef, Bentheim, Hamburg, Altona, Hamburg, Blankenese, Holstein, Bergedorf, L√ºneburg and Gda≈Ñsk. Waterloo was active in Amsterdam, Leeuwarden, and Utrecht, where he died in 1690.

The game depicts the Eastern Front theatre from 1941‚Äì1945. The gameplay is strongly influenced by Panzer General II and the graphics are displayed in a 3D environment using the OGRE Engine. It was developed from December 2006 to August 2009 (English version). In February 2010 a German version was released. Gameplay=Structure and content In Operation Barbarossa ‚Äì The Struggle for Russia, the player leads divisions of Germany, Romania or Russia through single scenarios or in campaigns, a string of scenarios each representing a specific battle on the Eastern Front. The campaigns are strictly historical. The first campaign is a small tutorial campaign of four scenarios length. The second campaign Operation Barbarossa consists of nine scenarios and takes place from June to December 1941. The third campaign Great Patriotic War also contains nine scenarios and leads the player through the Russian campaign from the defence of Moscow 1941 to the conquest of Berlin in 1945. A smaller fourth campaign includes the German Operation Blau with four scenarios and depicts the German battles for the Caucasus. Since Service Pack 1 there is a fifth campaign Army Group North is about the fights from the Prussian borders towards Leningrad in 1941. Basic rules The maps are divided in hexfields that represent about five square kilometer. The game provides fog of war so enemy units have to be spotted by own units. Each unit has a certain attack and spotting range. Movement is influenced by weather and terrain. Unit improvement One of the most important differences to Panzer General is that special abilities can be added to units called upgrades in the game. In a campaign the players units are kept from scenario to scenario (the core unit principle) and improve by gaining experience. Anytime a unit reaches a certain amount of experience the player may upgrade the unit with special abilities. There 47 different updates depending on the unit type (e.g. an AA unit has different upgrades than a tank unit) such as e.g.\\"Sharp Shooter\\" that increases the attack value against infantry units. Trivia *A leveleditor for making own scenarios is included. *Since version 1.20 the nations Great Britain and Italy were added to support a user made Africa Mod. *In March 2011 a tool called OBKonverter was released to make it easier to edit the game data. *In July 2011 a free so called \\"Service Pack 1\\" with a new campaign, new scenarios and graphics was released.

The goal of CIME is to improve the overall ethics standards of media and the internet.  History and mission  CIME began in July 2007, after thirty-two young journalists and professionals from five continents gathered in Prague for a week-long seminar. CIME emerged afterwards as a formal international framework with the intent of helping journalists take on a proactive role in shaping their societies. CIME encourages each media professional to take on a proactive role in defining ethical practices through the choices and decisions made at work on a daily basis. CIME urges media professionals to work together to make their own judgments and identify their own strategies. The driving emphasis is that media professionals together have the power to formulate and enforce a tacit code of ethics as a status quo of their profession. In 2013 CIME's founder Melisande Middleton was selected as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum in relation to her work building the CIME media ethics network globally.  Work  CIME collaborates with local media organisations in a range of countries to organise workshops for media professionals around the topic of ethics.  Approach CIME focuses on the role of responsible reporting in societal and economic development processes. The related the role of media in society to the role of information in economic growth, as illustrated in Paul Romer's work on New (or endogenous) Growth Theory. This theory articulates how knowledge input (e.g. creativity through innovation and ideas) is a key factor in sustaining growth. In other words, new ideas that are constantly created, for example via Research & Development as well as via other less formal initiatives, are what allow a society to improve its socioeconomic and technological levels. CIME emphasises that journalism participates actively in this growth model by circulating these ideas, communicating knowledge all the time and providing the medium for many information flows.

Its fossils were found in the Upper Elliot Formation which is probably Hettangian in age (around 200 million years ago). It was described on the basis of a partial, well preserved articulated skeleton. The type species, I. rachelis, was described in 2010 by Spanish palaeontologist F. Knoll. Discovery The holotype was discovered in southern Lesotho near Ha Ralekoala. The fossils were discovered in a mostly articulated state, although the skull was badly damaged, having broken into more than 120 fragments. An unpublished 2002 Ph.D dissertation referred to the remains, but they were not formally described for several years, and the find remained unpublished. In 2010, the fossils were described by F. Knoll of the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales-CSIC in Madrid as a new taxon, Ignavusaurus rachelis. The fossils were brought to the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, where they were provisionally catalogued as BM HR 20; the plan was to return the fossils to Lesotho upon the opening of the Lesotho National Museum. Etymology The generic name Ignavusaurus is derived from the Latin word ignavus (\\"coward\\") and Ancient Greek sauros (\\"lizard\\"). It refers to the type locality ‚Äì Ha Ralekoala, that literally means \\"The place of the father of the coward\\". The specific name of the type species, rachelis, honours Spanish palaeontologist Raquel L√≥pez-Anto√±anzas. Description The holotype had a body length of about and weighed about . Histological analysis of the humerus and femur indicates that BM HR 20 was fast-growing individual, maybe less than one year old, based on age determination studies. Like other early sauropodomorphs, Ignavusaurus had a long, slender neck and tail. It generally resembled Massospondylus and Melanorosaurus, two other sauropodomorphs from southern Africa, although the shape and position of the teeth, among other factors, led Knoll to conclude that the remains belong to a previously unknown genus. Classification Ignavusaurus is a basal sauropodomorph, a member of the long-necked, herbivorous, saurischian dinosaurs. Although originally recovered as more primitive than Plateosauria by Knoll (2010), Yates et al. (2011) noted that some characters used to place Ignavusaurus outside Massopoda are reflective of juvenile status and instead are more similar to juvenile Massospondylus, considering Ignavusaurus probably synonymous with Massospondylus. Meanwhile, a cladistic analysis presented by Apaldetti et al. (2011) found Ignavusaurus to be a valid genus which is most closely related to Sarahsaurus within Massopoda, somewhat agreeing with Yates et al. that Ignavusaurus is not as primitive as originally thought. A cladistic analysis conducted by Chapelle and Choiniere (2018) in their paper updating knowledge of the skull of Massospondylus recovered Ignavusaurus along with Sarahsaurus in Massospondylidae, as did the cladistic analysis of Chapelle et al. (2019).Chapelle KEJ, Choiniere JN.

Early life She was born Winifred Mary Redden, in Great Falls, Montana, United States. She was the third child of four of Daniel A. Redden and Mary Winifred Redden (maiden name Farrell). When Collins was 10 years old, her family moved to Missoula, Montana to run a hotel. A year later her parents divorced. When she was 11, she contracted a mild case of polio, but fully recovered without suffering a lasting disability. Soon after this her mother abandoned her, and she spent the next few years living with relatives in various locations. After attending High School in four different states, Collins graduated in 1929 while living in Seattle with one of her brothers. In 1930 she received a scholarship from the Brunswig Drug Corporation to attend the University of Southern California. She graduated with a Major in business, in 1935. It was in 1935 that she married her first husband Roy Quick. Also in that year, Collins got a job as the Personnel manager of Brunswig Drug Corporation. She recommended a number of changes to the President of the company; she suggested that the employees should be paid according to their performance and job type, regardless of gender. Because of the subsequent improvement in productivity Collins was financed, in 1937, to attend the Harvard-Radcliffe Training Course in Personnel Administration. In 1938, she was one of five who graduated from the first course. Military career Dr. Ada Comstock, the President of Radcliffe College when Collins was educated there, sat on a committee that was looking into the idea of recruiting women into the US Navy. She contacted Collins in June 1942 with a suggestion that she might apply for a commission. On August 4 of that year, Collins graduated from the first female commissioning class held at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts and was commissioned with the rank of Ensign on August 28, 1942. After the month-long training at Smith College, the Commanding Officer of the Naval Officer School, Captain Underwood, requested that she would stay on as the Personnel Director. Two months later, she was promoted to Lieutenant (junior grade). Her next assignment was in the summer of 1943; she was sent to the Bureau of Naval Personnel in Washington DC. She was one of twelve Naval officers tasked with the evaluation of the jobs the WAVES could do within the Navy as a whole, and the skills they would require to do them. In late 1944, the now Lieutenant Collins was the first female non-medical officer to serve outside the Continental United States when she was sent to Hawaii as the District Personnel Officer. She organised accommodation for 5,000 WAVES who were going to be posted there in January 1945. At the end of World War II, Collins was tasked with the demobilization of the WAVES and their reintroduction into civilian life. For this, she was promoted to Lieutenant Commander, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. In 1946, Collins returned to Washington DC and helped plan the eventual inclusion of females into the Navy; this led to the 1948 Women's Armed Forces Integration Act. On October 15, 1948, the first female Commissioned Officers of the United States Navy were sworn in; Collins was one of them. In 1951, she was then sent to Stanford University by the Navy for post graduate education and graduated in 1952 with a Master of Education. She then became the Assistant Director of Naval Personnel for the 12th Naval District; the area of the US comprising Nevada, Utah, and Northern California. In 1953 she was promoted to Commander; one of only two female Commanders in the entire US Navy. Between 1953 and 1956, Collins was Personnel Director of the 12th Naval District, and commanded 350 Navy personnel. This was the highest post ever held by a female Officer in the Navy. Her next post was to London, United Kingdom as Senior Assistant to the Commander in Chief of Naval Forces (Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean). Returning to the United States in the summer of 1957 she was appointed Chief of Naval Personnel for Women and promoted to the rank of Captain. She was the only female Captain, making her the most senior woman in the Navy, until she retired from service on August 31, 1962. Later life, death and legacy Upon retirement from the navy, Collins became the first female director of the Military Officers Association of America in 1964, and the first female National Vice President of the Navy League of the United States in 1965, and was later the Director. The Navy League have an award named after her; the Captain Winifred Quick Collins Award. In 1977, she was elected as the first female director of Corn Products International, a global consumer food products operation. Further Navy related roles she filled include; the first female trustee of the United States Naval Academy Foundation, in 1977; the first women named in the Navy League's Hall of Fame in 1990. Collins died at the Hospice of Northern Virginia on May 5, 1999 after suffering from spinal cancer. She was buried on May 25, 1999, in section 3 of the Arlington National Cemetery. In 1973, the Navy League of the United States established an award in her honor called the Captain Winifred Quick Collins Awards for Inspirational Leadership presented to a woman officer and an enlisted woman for exceptional leadership and performance in their military duties. Personal life Collins was married twice. She was married after she graduated from college to Roy T. Quick. Their marriage lasted from 1937 to 1941 when they divorced. In 1961, she married Rear Admiral Howard Lyman Collins. From her second marriage she had two step-sons; Howard Lyman Collins, Jr., and John Collins. Her second husband died in 1984 and is buried in Arlington Cemetery.

Usually these errors are minor, such as incorrect punctuation or capitalization, and the meaning is unaffected. But sometimes the matter is more substantive. Commonly, the error will have something to do with cross-referencing of statutes. For instance, the U.S. statutes pertaining to probation had a drafting error which caused the section about revocation of probation for failing to submit to a drug test to incorrectly reference a section about domestic violence. By clerical error, the law also omitted an accurate reference to community confinement. However, in both cases, courts upheld Congressional intent. Sometimes courts refuse to apply legislative intent that conflicts with the text of the law, as in the case of the Virginia General Assembly accidentally repealing the exemptions of almost all industries from the statute requiring employers to allow employees not to work on Sabbath. It was necessary for the legislature to re-assemble for a special session to correct the error. There have been instances, most commonly involving ballot initiatives, in which the drafting error was known prior to enactment. For instance, in the case of Proposition 165, a California welfare reform initiative, California Governor Pete Wilson announced that his public campaign statements would let the courts know that a provision eliminating the legislature's power to override a veto was an \\"unintended error,\\" and the mistake would be corrected, if necessary, by the courts.

Ed. Jean-Paul Pier. Basel: Birkh√§user, 2000. Print. He made major contributions to probability theory and its applications.  Early life  Igor Girsanov was born on 10 September 1934, in Turkestan (then Kazakh ASSR). He studied in Baku until his family moved to Moscow in 1950. While at school he was an active member of the Moscow State University maths club and won multiple Moscow mathematics olympiads.  Education  Between 1952 and 1960 Girsanov was an undergraduate and graduate student at Moscow State University. After his graduation he joined the faculty. In 1965 he became Head of the newly formed Probability and Statistics Laboratory at MSU.  Academic work  One can distinguish two periods in Girsanov's academic work. Prior to 1961, he worked as a member of a group of mathematicians united around E. B. Dynkin who were developing the theory of Markov processes. His thesis introduced the concept of a strong Feller process which proved to be particularly useful. In the same thesis he considered the problem of applying Markov processes to the solution of partial differential equations. He was among the first scientists to study elliptic and parabolic equations with discontinuous coefficients. In his papers on stochastic differential equations he determined the conditions when the discontinuity of the coefficients does not prevent the solution from being unique. He also produced important papers on the general theory of Markov processes. Girsanov was able to learn areas of mathematics that were unfamiliar to him very quickly. At the same time he was considering questions unrelated to stochastic processes. For example, he constructed an example of a dynamical system with a simple spectrum. In collaboration with B. S. Mityagin he worked on quasi- invariant measures on topological linear spaces. Around 1960 the problems of optimal management in industry and economics came to the fore in USSR. Many mathematicians were working in this area, mostly using familiar mathematical tools. Girsanov also started to work within this framework. But in 1961 he changed his approach. He began to develop a broader understanding of the issues at hand, developing new mathematical techniques. Girsanov became an advocate of mathematical economics, actively defending it against the opponents of quantitative methods. His research results had applications in industry. He published fifteen papers on applications to chemistry. His interests included the optimal control of chemical reactors. He also maintained his interest in theoretical mathematics developing the functional analysis required for optimisation problems.  Death  Girsanov died on 16 March 1967, as a result of an accident during his hike in the Sayan Mountains.

The film is a story of crime on New York's waterfront. It is based on the non-fiction book The Man Who Rocked the Boat, an autobiography by William Keating, played by Egan in the film. The book chronicles Keating's experiences as an assistant district attorney and as counsel to the New York City Anti-Crime Committee. In the portion of the book depicted in the film, Keating pursued a murder prosecution for a waterfront hit despite widespread corruption that stretched all the way into the district attorney's office. The title comes from the Richard Rodgers ballet of the same name, which was featured in the 1936 play On Your Toes. The plot line of the movie has no relation to the play, but the composition by Rodgers is indeed heard in the film, in an adaptation by Herschel Burke Gilbert (under the direction of music supervisor Joseph Gershenson) that was praised as \\"magnificent\\". Plot Thugs working for union boss Al Dahlke ambush and shoot Solly Pitts, an honest man who hires longshoremen on the docks. Solly is wounded and hospitalized, looked after by wife Madge, who trusts Lt. Tony Vosnick to see that justice is done. The district attorney, Howard Rysdale, turns over the investigation to a relative novice, Bill Keating. As his marriage to fiancee Daisy Pauly draws near, Keating tries in vain to get longshoremen to speak with him about activities on the docks. An intermediary tries to persuade Keating to collude with Dahlke, who issues vague threats after Bill rejects him. With witnesses intimidated and discredited by attorney John Jacob Masters in court, Bill and Daisy receive an anonymous death threat on their wedding day.

It stars Eartha Kitt, Sammy Davis Jr., and Henry Scott. It is a remake of the 1949 version (directed by Irving Rapper and starring Paulette Goddard), which itself was an adaptation of the 1936 stage play. Plot At the family home in Los Angeles, patriarch Joe Lucasta learns that his friend Otis has sold a farm in Alabama, distributing the proceeds to his children. Otis' son Rudolph is bringing his share to California, where Otis hopes that Joe can find a wife for Rudolph. Joe's son Stanley and son-in-law Frank hope to get the money by being the ones to find Rudolph a wife. Though uninterested in the money, Joe's wife Theresa suggests youngest daughter Anna, whom Joe put out of the house some time earlier. Theresa believes Anna is good and sees a chance for her to get a fresh start. Stanley, Frank and Frank's wife Stella regard Anna as a \\"slut\\", but will try to make her seem respectable to deceive Rudolph. Joe objects to their designs on Rudolph's money and to Anna returning, as he also holds her in low regard. Eventually, Frank browbeats Joe into going to Anna's last known whereabouts, a dockside cafe in San Diego, to bring her home. The cafe is Anna's regular haunt, as she leads a day-to-day existence seducing sailors for meals, drinks and board. As the cafe is closing, she has no place to spend the night. Just then, Danny Johnson arrives looking to renew his acquaintance with Anna. His naval enlistment ending, he asks her to move in with him, though he's uninterested in marriage. As Anna parties with Danny, Joe arrives and asks her to come home. Anna consents, but after her arrival, Joe angrily rebuffs her efforts to rebuild their relationship. Soon thereafter, Rudolph arrives in town. Having expected Rudolph to be a rube, Frank is disappointed to discover that he's a college graduate, unlikely to be fooled by Anna's guise of respectability. Furthermore, Rudolph's only interest is getting a job, the search for a wife having been more his father's concern than his own. When Rudolph meets Anna, however, he's smitten and they begin a romance. Anna tells him of her ejection from the household‚ÄîJoe had become angrily jealous when boys took interest in her, so he falsely accused her of promiscuity and threw her out‚Äîand confesses the truth of her life in San Diego. Rudolph says that he still loves her, and Anna agrees to marry him. As Anna is alone in the family home after the wedding, Danny arrives, responding to her letter asking him to come. She informs him that after sending the letter, she fell in love and got married. Danny protests, but Anna is insistent and he surrenders. As Danny is leaving, Joe comes home, declaring his intention to break up Anna's relationship with Rudolph. Anna begs Joe to allow her to begin a new life and be happy. Danny sticks up for Anna, offering to beat up Joe to prevent him from disrupting her marriage. But Joe says that he's ruined Rudolph's job opportunity by informing the employer about Anna's past. He says that he'll do the same any place Rudolph seeks work. As Anna breaks down into tears and Joe flies into a rage, Danny pulls Anna away and takes her out of the house. Danny and Anna head back to San Diego and spend days partying before deciding to move to Brazil. Danny needs time to raise money for ship's passage, but Anna wants to leave immediately and remembers she has money at the Lucasta home. When she and Danny return to retrieve it while the family is at church, they find Joe on his deathbed. While Danny goes to call a doctor, Anna stays with Joe as he deliriously addresses her as though she were a little girl, calling her his \\"angel\\", as he had before their relationship soured. Joe implores Jesus to watch over Anna, who is so overwhelmed that she's unable to respond to him before he dies. Danny observes Anna weep inconsolably over Joe and looks at a joyful picture of the two of them during Anna's childhood. He then quietly exits the house. As he's about to drive away, he smiles upon seeing the family, including Rudolph, returning from church. As Danny drives off, Rudolph notices him and realizes that Anna is in the house. He excitedly rushes past the others and runs inside.

It was Davis's first dramatic feature film role. He played Danny, a minor role in the original stage play, but the part was expanded to capitalize on his fame. Kitt claimed that Henry Scott was the actor who played opposite her and that Davis was there to sing the soundtrack. Kitt's deal gave her a percentage of the film earnings.

It was built in 1650, on the site of the medieval Peill Castle, and was the home of the Leith-Hay family for nearly three centuries. Since 1945 it has been run by the National Trust of Scotland (NTS). Leith Hall is set in a estate with scenic gardens. History The north wing of the house was constructed in 1650, on the site of the earlier Peill Castle, by James Leith of New Leslie (see Castle Croft). The east wing was added in 1756, and the south wing was built in 1797 by General Alexander Leith Hay. The west wing, containing the entrance front, was added in 1868 to complete the courtyard. In 1745, Andrew Hay of Rannes hid at Leith Hall after the Battle of Culloden where he fought for Bonnie Prince Charlie, later escaping to France. During the First World War it became a temporary Red Cross hospital and housed over 500 patients. In 1945 the house and grounds were presented to the NTS. The writer Elizabeth Byrd rented 14 rooms with her second husband, Barrie Gaunt in the 1960s. In The Ghosts in My Life and A Strange and Seeing Time, Byrd describes the paranormal occurrences she and her husband experienced while living here. The gardens and grounds are open to the public all year round. After several years' closure the Hall was re-opened by the NTS in 2013. Leith Hall was featured on the paranormal investigation show \\"Most Haunted\\" during their third series. The episode aired on Tuesday 28 October 2003 on Living TV.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4664366/?ref_=ttep_ep17 Description Leith Hall gardens The house contains fine china, family portraits and tapestries and some interesting clocks. The hall is noted for its gardens, set in stages with each sheltered by a wall or hedge and each with its own special character. The gardens contain flowering trees and shrubs, roses, fruit, vegetables and ornamental grasses. A little stream winds its way through the gravel paths and stone crevices and at the top of the garden, near the 18th century curved stables, is the circular \\"Moon Gate\\" leading to the old turnpike road, once the main thoroughfare to Aberdeen. There are also two nature trails, each about one and a half to two miles (3 km) long. The gardens also contain two ponds and a birdwatching site.

It was first synthesized in 1971 by Thomas J. Katz et al. The 1971 synthesis consisted of treating cyclopentadiene with methyllithium in dimethyl ether and then with dichloromethane and methyllithium in diethyl ether at ‚àí45 ¬∞C. It can also be formed in low yield (along with fulvene and Dewar benzene) by irradiation of benzene at 237 to 254 nm. The hydrocarbon in solution was described as having an extremely foul odor. Due to the high steric strain present in benzvalene, the pure compound (~71 kcal/mol higher in energy than benzene) easily detonates, for example by scratching. The compound converts to benzene with a chemical half-life of approximately 10 days. This symmetry- forbidden transition is believed to take place through a diradical intermediate. Polybenzvalene Benzvalene can be polymerized in a ROMP process to polybenzvalene. This polymer contains highly strained bicyclobutane rings which again makes it a sensitive material. The rings can be isomerized to 1,3-dienes and for this reason polybenzvalene has been investigated as a precursor to polyacetylene.

It stars David Niven, Alberto Sordi and Michael Wilding. It was nominated for three Golden Globe awards in 1963. Plot In 1941 \\"Abissinia\\" (Ethiopia) in Italian East Africa during the Second World War, British Army Major Richardson (Niven) is taken prisoner by an Italian detachment on the march in the desert when the pilot (Wilding) of his reconnaissance airplane manages to crash. He is questioned by Captain Blasi (Sordi), but gives only his name, rank and serial number. A British night attack is repulsed, but Italian Major Fornari is killed, leaving Blasi in charge. As time goes on, Blasi and Richardson come to irritate each other. Blasi decides to let the two escape to tell their superiors how ineffectual his force actually is in the hope that the British will not think them worth bothering about. However, Richardson is ordered to take his motorized squadron and round up Blasi's unit. Blasi and his men reach a fort, where supposedly the rest of their forces are rallying, but they find only abandoned equipment. Minutes later, Richardson's armored cars show up. Blasi, under the prodding of his friend Bernasconi, reluctantly agrees to surrender, though he is angry at what he considers his betrayal at Richardson's hands. He balks at Richardson's terms and has his Italian infantrymen sneak out the back, ordering most of his African soldiers to remain behind and surrender in an hour given as a deadline. Furious at being made a fool of, Richardson chases them into hilly terrain, against Captain Rootes' advice. After Blasi dismisses four African tribal warriors for misbehaving, they sneak behind the British and set a fire in the forest which destroys their armored cars and supplies. Both sides flee to an island in a nearby lake. After the fire dies down, they start marching across the desert, the outnumbered Italians as prisoners of war. When they reach a native village, the headman states he supports the Allied side and asks for the Italians' weapons and the Italians themselves, but Richardson refuses to part with either. They stop in an abandoned village because a British officer is too sick to be moved, only to find themselves surrounded by many hostile natives, led by the headman Richardson dealt with before. While they wait, Richardson and Blasi become acquainted. Richardson makes the decision to arm the Italians, but then discovers they left the Italian ammunition behind. He decides to have everyone sneak away, six at a time, down a gully, but that just makes it easier for the natives to capture them. After their weapons and boots are stolen, they are allowed to leave and take their war away with them. They reach a road. Blasi is delighted to find a road sign that indicates they are 150 miles behind Italian lines. He and his men march away. Shortly afterward, however, Richardson encounters a British convoy on its way to a victory celebration; the Italians have been defeated. Blasi and his men are recaptured. The two units meet again at a railway station. Richardson has his men present arms to show his new-found respect.

The Governor is the chief executive of the state and is the holder of the highest office in the executive branch of the government as well as being the commander in chief of the Alaska's state forces. Eleven people have served as governor of the State of Alaska over 13 distinct terms, though Alaska had over 30 civilian and military governors during its long history as a United States territory. Only two governors, William A. Egan and Bill Walker, were born in Alaska. Two people, Egan and Wally Hickel, have been elected to multiple non-consecutive terms as governor. Hickel is also noted for a rare third party win in American politics, having been elected to a term in 1990 representing the Alaskan Independence Party. The longest-serving governor of the state was Egan, who was elected three times and served nearly 12 years. The longest-serving territorial governor was Ernest Gruening, who served 13¬Ω years. The current governor is Republican Mike Dunleavy, who took office on December 3, 2018. Governors before statehood Alaska was purchased by the United States from the Russian Empire in 1867, with formal transfer occurring on October 18, 1867, which is now celebrated as Alaska Day. Before then, it was known as Russian America or Russian Alaska, controlled by the governors and general managers of the Russian-American Company. Commanders of the Department of Alaska The vast region was initially designated the Department of Alaska, under the jurisdiction of the Department of War and administered by the U.S. Army officers until 1877, when the Army was withdrawn from Alaska. The Department of the Treasury then took control, with the Collector of Customs as the highest ranking federal official in the territory.

Journal of Corporate Real Estate, 7(3).) Components and aims The role of the person charged with developing the strategy, the 'workplace strategist', is to understand the organisation's requirements and recommend a workplace solution that will help them meet their current and future needs. The workplace strategy may facilitate meeting business objectives such as: reducing property costs, improving business performance, merging two or more organisations/cultures, and relocating or consolidating occupied buildings. In more simple terms, the workplace strategy provides a response to either running out of space, having too much space, or wanting to introduce organisational change. The workplace strategy and its implementation quite often occur at an opportune moment such as a property lease break or a company merger or acquisition. The proposed workplace strategy will focus on how to use the space more efficiently and effectively. Recommendations often include moving from cellular (predominantly private office) environments to open plan, or introducing new ways of working and moving to a flexible, activity-based or agile working environment, as first proposed by Frank Duffy and Veldhoen + Company in nineties. Flexible working is where the occupants have access to a range of work settings, including working at home or on the move, but also share workstations, often referred to as hot desking or the related Hoteling. Since 2001, the concept of coworking space has also provided options for the startups, freelancers and companies who prefer this plug-and-play solution with shorter lease terms commitment. With the fourth industrial revolution, people have questioned the relevance of physical workspace and workplace strategy as team may work remotely outside an office space. The meaning and purpose of work spaces is changing to align with the organisation's growth strategy. Easy to follow reviews of how to develop a workplace strategy are provided by Eley and MarmotEley J & Marmot A (1995) Understanding Offices: What Every Manager Needs to Know About Office Buildings. London: Penguin. and Springer.Springer T (2011) Fundamentals of Workplace Strategy. Jasper, IN: Kimball Office. Workplace consultants Workplace strategies tend to be developed by specialist workplace consultants or the service may provided from within an architectural practice. Savage notes that: > \\"The successful implementation of a workplace strategy requires an > interdisciplinary team, internal and external to the organization ... A > workplace consultant may be retained to engage the team, help define success > criteria, manage the process, and assess results.\\" External workplace consultants are professionals from a number of backgrounds: business management, interior design and architecture, building surveying, real estate and facilities management, human resources and building research. The Workplace Consulting Organization (WCO) is the professional body for consultants offering workplace strategy services. Research Research is currently underway by the General Services AdministrationKampschroer K, Heerwagen J & Powell K (2007) Creating and Testing Workplace Strategy. California Management Review, 49(2).\\"Creating and Testing Workplace Strategy\\". to test the impact of workplace strategies, design, and new technologies on business performance. The evidence available to determine the effectiveness of health-promoting policies in workplaces such as healthy catering policies; point-of-purchase nutrition labeling; environmental supports for healthy eating and physical activity; tobacco control policies; weight management programmes are sparse and inconsistent. There is low certainty of evidence that the strategies make little or no benefits in employee's health behaviours. It is also uncertain whether such strategies are cost-effective.

Its signatories included Lord Cornwallis on behalf of the British East India Company, representatives of the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Maratha Empire, and Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore. Background The war broke out in late 1789 when Tipu Sultan, the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, attacked Travancore, an ally of the British East India Company. After a little over two years of fighting, forces of the company led by Lord Charles, 2nd Earl Cornwallis, along with allied forces from the Maratha Empire and Hyderabad, laid siege in February 1792 to Mysore's capital, Seringapatam(also called Srirangapatinam).Dodwell, pp. 336‚Äì337 Rather than attempting to storm the works at great cost to all sides, Cornwallis entered into negotiations with Tipu to end the conflict. The resulting treaty was signed on 18 March. Cornwallis had hoped to use the treaty as a wide-ranging peace settlement that would, in addition to reducing or removing the threat of Mysore, prevent conflict between Hyderabad and the Marathas. The Marathas had, however, resisted inclusion of such language.Fortescue, p. 712 Terms General Lord Cornwallis receiving Tipoo Sultan's sons as hostages, by Robert Home, c. 1793 1800 map by James Rennell showing color-coded political areas, military campaigns by the British East India Company, and the lands acquired by the company through the Treaty of Seringapatam Under the terms of the treaty, Mysore ceded about one-half of its territories to the other signatories. The Peshwa acquired territory up to the Tungabhadra River, the Nizam was awarded land from the Krishna to the Penner River, and the forts of Cuddapah and Gandikota on the south bank of the Penner. The East India Company received a large portion of Mysore's Malabar Coast territories between the Kingdom of Travancore and the Kali River, and the Baramahal and Dindigul districts. Mysore granted the rajah of Coorg his independence,Dodworth, p. 337 although Coorg effectively became a company dependency. Tipu Sultan, unable to pay an indemnity of 330 lakhs of rupees, was required to surrender two of his three sons as hostages of war. NotesSee also * Mysore invasion of Kerala References * Dodwell, H.

It is designated turret 51b and lies east of the Signal Tower at Pike Hill. Location Leahill Turret lies on the lower slope of Allieshaw Rigg; Milecastle 52, Bankshead, is 540 yards to the West, Turret 51A, Piper Syke, lying 540 yards to the East and Milecastle 51, Bowers Wall 540 yards to the East of it. History Leahill 51b was built shortly after AD 122 as part of Hadrian's Wall, dismantled under the Emperor Septimius Severus, and casually re-occupied late in the 4th century. Such lookout towers were only occupied on a temporary basis by soldiers who were patrolling the wall.Pastscape Record : Accessed : 2010-03-13 This turret was until 1927 buried beneath the road, when excavations led to its discovery and also the discovery of the precise location of the turf wall that preceded the later stone structure.Embleton, Page 245 The new road formation was created behind the turrets and the wall. In 1958 Leahill turret was fully excavated prior to its consolidation.English Heritage Records : Accessed : 2010-03-13 This Roman turret was a detached structure abutting the Wall, with internal measurements 13 feet 8 inches North-South by 14 feet 6 inches East-West. The slight remains of the original turf wall to the East and West had been overlain by occupation materials. Leahill had been much robbed surviving only to a maximum height of 9 courses or approximately one metre height; a platform was found in the centre of the North wallHeritage Gateway and in the 4th century a shelter was built internally against the South wall.English Heritage Interpretation Board Several occupation layers were located prior to a stone flag floor being laid. A small cottage, still occupied in living memory, once stood close by on the opposite side of the existing road, and robbing also took place to supply material for the drystone dyking and the farm of Leahill. The Roman ditch in front of the Wall is clearly defined in this area, except at Leahill Farm; as is the Vallum. Micro-history The road running past Leahill is followed by both the Hadrian's Wall Path National Trail and Hadrian's Cycleway.Geograph : Accessed : 2010-03-13. Metal detectorists have found a number of Roman coins in the area and a skeleton was uncovered during the 1958 excavations at Leahill Turret. Illuminating Hadrian's Wall A volunteer stationed at Leahill Turret 51B, one of Cell 27 of the event volunteer 'legions'. On 13 March 2010, all 84 miles of Hadrian's Wall was illuminated from Tyneside to Cumbria with points of light. The route was lit by 500 gas beacons, flares and torches at 250m intervals, with the assistance of over 1000 volunteers. Leahill Turret was part of this event, garrisoned by two volunteers, marking the 1600th anniversary of the cessation of Roman rule in Britain in AD410. The 500 points of light were filmed by a helicopter at dusk. Turrets These structures were built to a standard pattern, two storeys high with the ground floor used for cooking with a movable ladder. The upper storey probably had sleeping accommodation for two soldiers, whilst the other two were on patrol.Embleton, Page 18 A tradition exists that the troops used pipes to communicate between turrets. The fire provided some light; the absence of a chimney was made up for by an unglazed window. A stone water tank would have been set into the floor.Embleton, Page 74 Views of Leahill File:Turret 51B, Leahill, Hadrian's Wall.JPGThe turret, looking North File:Leahill Turret 51B, looking East, Hadrian's Wall.JPGLooking North-East towards Tommy's Crag File:Leahill Farm and a fosse of Hadrian's Wall, near Pike Hill.JPGLeahill Farm and the fosse, looking West.

It is endemic to California, from Mendocino County south to San Diego County.http://www.californiaherps.com/salamanders/pages/t.t.torosa.html Distribution It is native to the California coast, California Coast Ranges, the western Transverse Ranges, and the northern Peninsular Ranges. Habitat California coastal range newts can be found in coastal areas and coastal range mountains in oak forests, woodlands, or rolling grasslands. In the terrestrial phase they live in moist to dry habitats under woody or leafy debris, in rock crevices, or in animal burrows. In the aquatic phase they are found in ponds, reservoirs, lakes and slow-moving streams. Description California coastal range newts have squat, stocky, and muscular bodies with legs that protrude straight out sideways from the body, and bend downward at the elbows. The short neck and head are approximately the same width and the nose narrows to a point. Large protuberant eyes are set at the side of the head. They are 12.5‚Äì20 cm (4.9-7.8 in) long from the nose to the tip of the tail. Males are slightly larger. Scientists believe these newts may live as long as 20 years or more. Behavior Terrestrial except in breeding season when they become aquatic, California coast range newts are gregarious and aggressive. They make clicking and often yelping sounds when disturbed. When threatened, a newt assumes a defensive posture known as the Unken Reflex in which it holds its head up and points its tail straight out to display its brightly-colored ventral side, while at the same time secreting toxin from its skin glands. This is probably a warning to would-be predators that the newt is toxic and dangerous to eat. The warning color display is called aposematic coloration. Diet and feeding Their diet consists of small invertebrates such as worms, snails, slugs, insects and insect eggs, and amphibian larvae. They are known to be cannibalistic if other foods are in short supply. Newts capture prey by projecting out their tongue which has an adhesive texture. The main native predator of the California coastal range newt is the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis), some of which have apparently developed a genetic resistance or immunity to tetrodotoxin. =Reproduction= Breeding takes place for 6‚Äì12 weeks during the rainy season which normally starts in December. Both sexes generally migrate back to the same water area where they hatched with males reaching the sites a few weeks before females. During courtship the male climbs onto the back of the female, clasps her tightly, rubs his chin over her nose, flutters his tail, and strokes her cloaca, a behavior called amplexus. The nuptial pads that males develop in the breeding season help them to hang onto the female. After about an hour of amplexus, the male deposits his spermatophore on the substrate. The female moves over it, and picks it up with her cloaca. Over several days she will lay three to six spherical egg sacs which she attaches to underwater rocks or plants. Each egg sac contains from seven to about forty eggs and the gelatinous membrane covering the eggs contains poisonous tetrodotoxin. If the adult newts have not cannibalized the egg masses, larvae usually hatch after 14‚Äì21 days. However, incubation may go on for up to 52 days depending on food availability and temperature of the water‚Äîthe colder the water, the longer the incubation. Newt larvae resemble tadpoles with legs. They have bushy gills in younger developmental stages, balancer organs, and well-developed tails that extend forward to the shoulder area. They are pale yellow and have two dark bands on their backs. They metamorphose into adults in three to six weeks. West coast newts, unlike east coast, do not have an eft stage between larva and adult. Adaptation The Coastal Range newt produce a potent poison called tetrodotoxin from specialized glands in their skin. Ingestion of this poison by handling or eating them causes severe neurological symptoms and, in some instances, death from respiratory or cardiac failure. The toxin found in juveniles is several times more potent than that in adults. Conservation Taricha torosa torosa is listed as a species of special concern in California but has no federal conservation status. In California, it is illegal to sell the Coastal Range newt in pet shops. They are susceptible to stress from loss and degradation of habitat, and especially in the Santa Monica Mountains from predation of eggs and larvae by introduced mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and crayfish (Procambarus clarkia). Large numbers of California coastal range newts move together in breeding season, during or after rains, often traveling across roadways and highways. During the breeding season, some residents and local governments close roads to protect migrating newts and salamanders from becoming roadkill. A park in Contra Costa County in California posts a drive through the park with this notice: During wet weather conditions, Southpark Drive will be closed to protect migrating newts.

The name came from Jules Gastambide, who financed the company, and Gabriel Mengin, the aircraft engineer. Design and development The monoplane (later known as the Gastambide-Mengin I) was powered by a Antoinette piston engine driving a tractor propeller. It was noted for having a complex quadricycle landing gear. The monoplane made four flights between 8 and 14 February 1908 flown by a mechanic named Boyer, the furthest being a flight of 150 m. After these flights, the aircraft was rebuilt between February and August 1908 as the Gastambide-Mengin II (later named the Antoinette II), the modifications including revised, trailing edge-hinged triangular ailerons. The modified aircraft made three short flights in August 1908, one of these on 21 August 1908 being the first circle flown by a monoplane, and on a flight the previous day (20 August 1908) Robert Gastambide became the first passenger flown in a monoplane. With lessons learnt from the design, Levavasseur went on to design a family of monoplanes named after Antoinette Gastambide, the daughter of Jules Gastambide.

Main series=30 Days of Night This was a three-issue miniseries that jump-started the careers of writer Steve Niles and artist Ben Templesmith. Vampires flock to Barrow, Alaska, where the sun sets for about 30 days, allowing them to feed without the burden of sleep to avoid lethal sunlight. When the vampire elder Vicente learns of this plan, he travels to Barrow to end the feeding, in order to preserve the secrecy of vampires. Because of the cold, the vampires' senses are weakened and a few of the town's residents are able to hide. One such resident is Sheriff Eben Olemaun, who saves the town by injecting vampire blood into his veins. He uses his enhanced strength to fight Vicente, saving the lives of the few remaining townspeople, including his wife Stella. Suffering the same weakness as all vampires, Eben dies and turns to ash when the sun rises. Dark Days This was the follow-up to 30 Days of Night, featuring the original creative team. Beginning in June 2003, this series featured the exploits of Stella Olemaun after surviving the attack on Barrow in the original series. After publishing an account of the attack (30 Days of Night), Stella attempts to spread the word of what happened by giving lectures to audiences. Even when she fights off a vampire attack at one lecture, her stories are not believed as her publisher lists her book as fiction. Stella draws the attention of the Los Angeles vampire population, as well as the lover of Vicente, the head vampire from the original series. Learning that there may be a way to bring back her former husband Eben, Stella strikes a deal with vampire Dane, who seeks revenge for the murder of his mentor by Vicente. The two form a brief romantic relationship. Stella exchanges proof of the existence of vampires for her husband's remains, in the hope of bringing him back from the dead. She double-crosses the vampire party, blowing up a large number of them in a house, before successfully resurrecting Eben. The two reconcile for a moment before the still-vampiric Eben lunges, fangs bared, for her throat. This series also serves as an introduction to the vampiric FBI agent, Norris. Annual 2004 A 48-page one-shot released in January 2004 by regular 30 Days of Night publisher IDW. The issue features four short stories, each written by Steve Niles, but featuring different illustrators. * \\"The Book Club\\", illustrated by co-creator and original 30 Days of Night artist Ben Templesmith. It involves a suburban book club's discussion of Stella Olemaun's book (also titled 30 Days of Night). This arouses suspicion about a shut-in neighbor, leading to his murder by the unruly book club. * \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", illustrated by Szymon Kudranski. It features Dane seeking a hand transplant from an eccentric doctor. * \\"Agent Norris: MIA\\", pencilled by Brandon Hovet. It depicts agent Norris's transformation from a \\"scout\\" or \\"bug eater\\" to a full-blown vampire. * \\"The Trapper\\", illustrated by Josh Medors. This story introduces John Ikos, a Barrow resident turned vampire hunter (and a main character in later series). 30 Days of Night: Return to Barrow Return to Barrow is another sequel to the original series by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith. It features Brian Kitka, the brother of a victim of the attack on Barrow in the original miniseries. Kitka becomes Barrow's new sheriff after moving there with his son to investigate his brother's demise. Kitka's skepticism about the claims of a vampire attack disappears when he discovers his deceased brother's journal, which includes a full account of the attack. He finds himself protecting the town along with John Ikos. This story features the return of several characters from the previous series, including Eben and Stella who save Brian's son from the vampires. 30 Days of Night: Bloodsucker Tales Bloodsucker Tales marked the first time a writer other than Niles would work on the series. Throughout its 8 issues, two stories were told. * \\"Dead Billy Dead\\", written by Steve Niles and illustrated by Kody Chamberlain. This serialized story featured a young man named Billy who was turned into a vampire and later kidnapped, along with his girlfriend Maggie, by a vampire-obsessed scientist. Meanwhile, Goodis, a police officer whom Maggie had called when approached by the vampiric Billy, discovers Stella Olemaun's book. * \\"Juarez or Lex Nova and the Case of the 400 Dead Mexican Girls\\", written by Matt Fraction and illustrated by Ben Templesmith. This story depicted Lex Nova's investigation of the disappearance of hundreds of girls in Juarez, Mexico. A group of vampires called the Zero Family Circus arrives in Mexico at the same time, believing the deaths to be caused by an estranged vampire. Annual 2005 A 48-page one-shot titled \\"The Journal of John Ikos\\" released in December 2005 by IDW. It tells the story of John Ikos leaving Barrow and going to Los Angeles in search of Agent Norris. While in Los Angeles, John Ikos meets Billy (from the \\"Dead Billy Dead\\" story in Bloodsucker Tales) and Dane, and does battle with a gang of vampires going by the name The Night Crew led by a vampire called Santana. Written by Steve Niles and illustrated by Nat Jones. 30 Days of Night: Dead Space After a self-imposed hiatus following the tragic events of the last shuttle mission, NASA prepares to launch the Icarus on a simple mission to help restore the nation's confidence in the space program. But their worst fears are realized when it is discovered that something has gotten aboard the shuttle, something ferocious, something with fangs and a taste for blood. Written by Steve Niles and Dan Wickline, it was drawn by Milx. 30 Days of Night: Spreading the Disease This new series picks up with Agent Michael Henson from the Dead Space series being sent off to exile in Alabama after trying to get people to take the vampire threat seriously. He is contacted by a mysterious caller who suggests the question of \\"why someone would want to put a vampire in space\\" still needed to be answered. So Henson takes the time he has before checking in at his new office to try to follow the fangs. This leads him into a much bigger and more dangerous situation. Written by Dan Wickline and illustrated by Alex Sanchez. 30 Days of Night: Eben and Stella In the waning moments of Dark Days, Stella managed to bring her vampire husband Eben back from beyond, only he came back hungry. Afterward, he turned Stella into a vampire, therefore reuniting them. This miniseries fills in the black gaps between that tale and Return to Barrow. It is co-written by Steve Niles and Kelly Sue DeConnick and illustrated by Justin Randall. 30 Days of Night: Red Snow It is 1941 and Hitler's Operation Silver Fox has failed, but the war on the Eastern Front drags on as the Russian winter starts to bite. British military attach√© Corporal Charlie Keating observes the war from the Soviet side, making sure crucial supplies get through to aid Stalin's front in the battle against the Nazis. With luck, he too will survive to see the end of the war. But something else is out there, and they are not the Nazis. No matter how hard humanity tries to kill itself, something else does it better. Written and illustrated by Ben Templesmith. 30 Days of Night: Beyond Barrow After years of attacks and then several without, the citizens of Barrow have become united against random attacks on their city by the undead. Unfortunately, the same does not apply outside of Barrow or the rest of the mysterious Arctic Circle. Written by Steve Niles and illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz. 30 Days of Night: 30 Days 'Til Death The events of Barrow have rippled throughout the world, causing a death squad of elders to \\"thin the herd\\" of America's troublesome new breed. Trying not to be found, Rufus attempts to hide by getting a dog, and a girlfriend, pretending to like his neighbors, and going to extreme lengths to hide his insatiable craving for blood. Written and illustrated by David Lapham. 30 Days of Night: Night, Again Fleeing the site of a secondary vampire infestation in the cold wilds of Alaska, a band of survivors arrive at a climate change facility during the final days of a long period of extended daylight. The inhabitants of the research compound are trying to determine the nature of a strange object found in the ice when the survivors arrive, leading to a frightening and bloody confrontation between humans and vampires and an odd and unexpected guest.

The plant is a small shrub growing 1.2 to 1.8 meters in height and 90 to 120 cm in width with ovate, spade shaped leaves 5 to 10 cm long when fully grown. It blooms yellow to white flowers in the late spring to mid summer, and produces small (1‚Äì2 cm wide) orange fruit. The fruit's juices can be irritating to the touch, so it is recommended that gloves be used when removing or handling. The plant is characterized by its purple stems, which are completely covered by striking purple and green thorns about 2 cm long, from which its common names are ostensibly derived. The plant is short lived with a 3 to 5-year lifespan. The plant can be grown ornamentally, requiring full sun and modest water. The plant is known to grow in a wide variety of soils and can resist temperatures as low as for a few days. Seeds can be harvested from the fruits, and stem cuttings can be used to grow the plant in about 10 to 20 days. It is also known as a natural reservoir of the potato virus X.

Since the term is defined in relation to human activities, which species are included vary by region and enterprise. The term derives from the Latin vermis (worm), and was originally used for the worm- like larvae of certain insects, many of which infest foodstuffs. The term varmint (and vermint) has been found in sources from c. 1530‚Äì1540s.\\"Vermint\\" cited in England in 1539, Oxford English Dictionary', 2nd ed  Definition  The term \\"vermin\\" is used to refer to a wide scope of organisms, including rodents, cockroaches, termites, bed bugs, mosquitoes, ferrets, stoats, sables, rats, and occasionally foxes. Historically, in the 16th and 17th century, the expression also became used as a derogatory term associated with groups of persons typically plagued by vermin, namely beggars and vagabonds, and more generally the poor. Disease-carrying rodents and insects are the usual case, but the term is also applied to larger animals‚Äîespecially small predators‚Äîtypically because they consume resources which humans consider theirs, such as livestock and crops. Birds which eat cereal crops and fruit are an example. The American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), is widely hated by farmers because of crop depredation. Pigeons, which have been widely introduced in urban environments, are also sometimes considered vermin. Some varieties of snakes and arachnids may also be referred to as vermin. \\"Vermin\\" is also used by some people as a term of abuse, either individually or collectively.  Varmint  Varmint or varmit is an American-English colloquialism, a corruption of \\"vermin\\" particularly common to the American East and South-east within the nearby bordering states of the vast Appalachia region. The term describes species which raid farms from without, as opposed vermin (such as rats) that infest from within, thus referring mainly to predators such as feral dogs, foxes, weasels, and coyotes, sometimes even wolves or rarely bears, but also, to a lesser degree, herbivores and burrowing animals that directly damage crops and land. Although \\"varmint/varmit\\" is not the prevalent usage in Standard Written English, it is a common descriptor for certain kinds of weapons and pest control situations in the Appalachian and nearby states and the American West and South-west which have adopted terms such as varmint rifle and varmint hunting.  Deterioration of balance  Any species can develop into vermin if introduced into a region where there are favorable living conditions and few natural predators. In such cases, they are seen as an invasive species and humans often choose to fill the role of the predator to limit the danger to the environment. Examples of vermin include goats on the Gal√°pagos Islands, rabbits in Australia or cats on Prince Edward Islands. Rats, mice, and cockroaches are common urban and suburban vermin.  United Kingdom  Under Tudor \\"vermin laws\\", many creatures were seen as competitors for the produce of the countryside and bounties were paid by the parish for their carcasses. The declaration of the red kite as vermin led to its decline to the point of extirpation in the UK by the 20th century. However, the red kite has since been reintroduced to much of Scotland and the majority of England and Wales by the trans-location of breeding pairs from other parts of Europe.

The most widely distributed species of pinniped (walruses, eared seals, and true seals), they are found in coastal waters of the northern Atlantic, Pacific Oceans, Baltic and North Seas. Harbor seals are brown, silvery white, tan, or gray, with distinctive V-shaped nostrils. An adult can attain a length of 1.85 m (6.1 ft) and a mass of up to . Blubber under the seal's skin helps to maintain body temperature. Females outlive males (30‚Äì35 years versus 20‚Äì25 years). Harbor seals stick to familiar resting spots or haulout sites, generally rocky areas (although ice, sand, and mud may also be used) where they are protected from adverse weather conditions and predation, near a foraging area. Males may fight over mates under water and on land. Females bear a single pup after a nine-month gestation, which they care for alone. Pups can weigh up to and are able to swim and dive within hours of birth. They develop quickly on their mothers' fat-rich milk, and are weaned after four to six weeks. The global population of harbor seals is 350,000‚Äì500,000, but subspecies in certain habitats are threatened. Once a common practice, sealing is now illegal in many nations within the animal's range. Description Skull of a harbor seal Skeleton of harbor seal in the Seal Museum on Iceland Individual harbor seals possess a unique pattern of spots, either dark on a light background or light on a dark. They vary in color from brownish black to tan or grey; underparts are generally lighter. The body and flippers are short, heads are rounded. Nostrils appear distinctively V-shaped. As with other true seals, there is no pinna (ear flap). An ear canal may be visible behind the eye. Including the head and flippers, they may reach an adult length of 1.85 meters (6.1 ft) and a weight of 55 to 168 kg (120 to 370 lb). Females are generally smaller than males. Population White harbor seal on moss, Alaska There are an estimated 350,000‚Äì500,000 harbor seals worldwide. While the population is not threatened as a whole, the Greenland, Hokkaid≈ç and Baltic Sea populations are exceptions. Local populations have been reduced or eliminated through disease (especially the phocine distemper virus) and conflict with humans, both unintentionally and intentionally. Killing seals perceived to threaten fisheries is legal in the United Kingdom, Norway, and Canada, but commercial hunting is illegal. Seals are also taken in subsistence hunting and accidentally as bycatch (mainly in bottomset nets). Along the Norwegian coast, bycatch accounted for 48% of pup mortality. Seals in the United Kingdom are protected by the 1970 Conservation of Seals Act, which prohibits most forms of killing. In the United States, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 prohibits the killing of any marine mammals and most local ordinances, as well as NOAA, instruct citizens to leave them alone unless serious danger to the seal exists. Subspecies Harbor seal in Svalbard The five subspecies of Phoca vitulina are: * Eastern Atlantic common seals, P. v. vitulina (L., 1758), from Europe and western Asia. * Western Atlantic common seals, P. v. concolor (DeKay, 1842), inhabit eastern North America. The validity of this subspecies is questionable, and not supported by genetic evidence. They might be part of the Eastern Atlantic subspecies. * Ungava seals (Lacs des Loups Marins seals), P. v. mellonae (Doutt, 1942), are found in eastern Canada in fresh water (included in P. v. concolor by many authors). (See: Freshwater seal) * Pacific common seals, P. v. richardsi (Gray, 1864), are located in western North America. * Insular seals, Phoca vitulina stejnegeri (J. A. Allen, 1902), are in eastern Asia. Habitat and diet Phoca vitulina (harbor seals) at Point Lobos, California Harbor seal in the freshwater Connecticut River, following the shad run Harbor seals prefer to frequent familiar resting sites. They may spend several days at sea and travel up to 50 km in search of feeding grounds, and will also swim more than a hundred miles upstream into fresh water in large rivers in search of migratory fish like shad and likely salmon. Resting sites may be both rugged, rocky coasts, such as those of the Hebrides or the shorelines of New England, or sandy beaches, like the ones that flank Normandy in Northern France or the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Harbor seals frequently congregate in harbors, bays, sandy intertidal zones, and estuaries in pursuit of prey fish such as salmon,Photographic evidence menhaden, anchovy, sea bass, herring, mackerel, cod, whiting and flatfish, and occasionally shrimp, crabs, mollusks, and squid. Atlantic subspecies of either Europe or North America also exploit deeper-dwelling fish of the genus Ammodytes as a food source and Pacific subspecies have been recorded occasionally consuming fish of the genus Oncorhynchus. Although primarily coastal, dives to over 500 m have been recorded.Burns, J.J. (2002). Harbor seal and spotted seal Phoca vitulina and P. largha. In: W.F. Perrin, B. Wursig and J.G.M. Thewissen (eds), Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals Academic Press. pp. 552‚Äì560. Harbor seals have been recorded to attack, kill and eat several kinds of ducks.\\"Harbour seal kills and eats duck\\", Tetrapod Zoology, 6 march 2008. Behavior, survival, and reproduction Harbor seal swimming Harbor seal colony in Helgoland, Germany Harbor seals are solitary, but are gregarious when hauled out and during the breeding season, though they do not form groups as large as some other seals. When not actively feeding, they haul to rest. They tend to be coastal, not venturing more than 20 km offshore. The mating system is not known, but thought to be polygamous. Females give birth once per year, with a gestation period around nine months. Females have a mean age at sexual maturity of 3.72 years and a mean age at first parturition of 4.64. Both courtship and mating occur under water. Pregnancy rate of females was 92% from age 3 to age 36, with lowered reproductive success after the age of 25 years. Birthing of pups occurs annually on shore. The timing of the pupping season varies with location,Temte, J. L. (1994). Photoperiod control of birth timing in harbour seal (Phoca vitulina). Journal of Zoology (London) 233: 369‚Äì384. occurring in February for populations in lower latitudes, and as late as July in the subarctic zone. The mothers are the sole providers of care, with lactation lasting 24 days.Daryl Boness and W. Don Bowen, \\"The Evolution of Maternal Care in Pinnipeds\\", BioScience. 46(9):645-654. 1996. Researchers have found males gather under water, turn on their backs, put their heads together, and vocalize to attract females ready for breeding. The single pups are born well developed, capable of swimming and diving within hours. Suckling for three to four weeks, pups feed on the mother's rich, fatty milk and grow rapidly; born weighing up to 16 kilograms, the pups may double their weight by the time of weaning. A pup Pup nursing at thumb Harbor seals must spend a great deal of time on shore when moulting, which occurs shortly after breeding. This onshore time is important to the lifecycle, and can be disturbed when substantial human presence occurs.Patrick Sullivan, Gary Deghi and C.Michael Hogan, Harbor Seal Study for Strawberry Spit, Marin County, California, Earth Metrics file reference 10323, BCDC and County of Marin, January 23, 1989. The timing of onset of moult depends on the age and sex of the animal, with yearlings moulting first and adult males last. A female mates again immediately following the weaning of her pup. Harbor seals are sometimes reluctant to haul out in the presence of humans, so shoreline development and access must be carefully studied in known locations of seal haul out. In comparison to many pinniped species, and in contrast to otariid pinnipeds, harbor seals are generally regarded to be more vocally reticent. However, they do utilize non-harmonic vocalizations to maintain breeding territories and to attract mates during specified times of year, and also during mother and pup interactions. Annual survival rates were calculated at 0.91 for adult males, and 0.902 for adult females. Maximum age for females was 36 and for males 31 years. In North America Pacific Coast= The California population of subspecies P. v. richardsi amounted to about 25,000 individuals as of 1984. Pacific harbor seals or California harbor seals are found along the entire Pacific Coast shoreline of the state. They prefer to remain relatively close to shore in subtidal and intertidal zones, and have not been seen beyond the Channel Islands as a pelagic form; moreover, they often venture into bays and estuaries and even swim up coastal rivers. They feed in shallow littoral waters on herring, flounder, hake, anchovy, codfish, and sculpin.Newby, T.C. (1978). Pacific Harbor Seal pp 184‚Äì191 in D. Haley, ed. Marine Mammals of Eastern North Pacific and Arctic Waters, Pacific Search Press, Seattle WA. Breeding occurs in California from March to May, with pupping between April and May, depending on local populations. As top-level feeders in the kelp forest, harbor seals enhance species diversity and productivity. They are preyed upon by killer whales (orcas) and white sharks. Haul out sites in California include urban beaches and from time to time they can be seen having a nap on the beach in all of San Francisco Bay, which would include the conurbation of Richmond, Oakland, and San Francisco, the Greater Los Angeles area, which would include Santa Barbara, the City of Angels itself, and Long Beach, and all of San Diego Bay, most famously beaches near La Jolla.http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dbh/docs/1063558_PinnipedManagementPlan.pdfhttps://www.scpr.org/blogs/environment/2011/08/22/3290/how- safely-spot-sea-lions-and-seals-along- southern/https://www.santabarbaraca.gov/gov/depts/waterfront/stranded_marine_mammals.asphttps://www.presstelegram.com/2016/12/11/why- sharks-and-seals-are-coming-to-los-angeles-and-long-beach- ports/https://baykeeper.org/news/column/harbor-seals-home- bayhttps://www.mercurynews.com/2016/08/09/forget-pier-39-harbor-seals-find- spot-in-east-bay/ Considerable scientific inquiry has been carried out by the Marine Mammal Center and other research organizations beginning in the 1980s regarding the incidence and transmission of diseases in harbor seals in the wild, including analysis of phocine herpesvirus.Goldstein, T., Mazet, J.A.K., Gulland, F.M.D., Rowles, T., Harvey, J.T., Allen, S.G., King, D.P., Aldridge, B.M., Stott, J.L. (2004). The transmission of phocine herpesvirus-1 in rehabilitating and free-ranging Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in California. Veterinary Microbiology; 103:131‚Äì141. In San Francisco Bay, some harbor seals are fully or partially reddish in color, possibly caused by an accumulation of trace elements such as iron or selenium in the ocean, or a change in the hair follicles. Although some of the largest pupping areas harbor seals are found in California, they are also found north along the Pacific Coast in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska. Large populations move with the season south along the west coast of Canada and may winter on the islands in Washington and Oregon. Pupping is known to occur in both Washington and Oregon as of 2020, and locals are reminded not to molest the newborns because mothers out foraging for food might not come back if they believe their baby has been with humans: she shall see them as a predator and it not being worth the risk to fight for the pup.https://www.chinookobserver.com/life/public-urged-to-refrain-from- approaching-seal-pups-on-local- beaches/article_b4f3d09a-9bb4-11ea-958f-a7a6b83ec7b6.html =Atlantic Coast = Historically, the range of the harbor seal extended from the mouth of the St. Lawrence River and Greenland to the sandy beaches of North Carolina, a distance of well over a thousand miles (greater than 1600 km.) Evidence of their presence in these areas is consistent with both the fossil record as well as a few landmarks named for them during colonization: Robbin's Reef off of Bayonne, New Jersey, gets its name from the Dutch word robben, meaning \\"seals\\". On the border between Canada and the US is an island known as Machias Seal Island, a place where today the harbor seal will occasionally visit but is now a sanctuary for puffins. Over the course of hundreds of years, however, the seal was wiped out steadily by being shot on sight by fishermen and by massive pollution. The evidence for this is found in documents all along the coast of New England which put a bounty on the head of every seal shot, as well as the accounts of harbormasters. New York City, when it was founded in the 1640s, was founded on top of an enormous estuary teeming with life that included the harbor seal. Oil in the 1800s started the process of pollution that was later compounded by even more toxic 20th century chemicals that included PCB's and dioxin. By the 1972 Clean Water Act, New York Harbor was almost dead-almost no living thing could survive in it.https://catapult.co/stories/why-these-seals-left-new-yorkand-why-they-came- back Approximately 300 miles to the north, Boston Harbor was equally polluted. Raw sewage had been dumped in the harbor since the late 1800s and the stench of fecal matter in the Charles River was overpowering, as evidenced by the song \\"Dirty Water\\" by the Standells, written in 1966. Flatfish, abundant in the area, had enormous tumors in their livers by the 1980s and the harbor seal was long gone, shot to oblivion.https://www.inverse.com/article/52468-tumor- free-flounder-are-just-1-dividend-from-the-cleanup-of-boston-harbor As of 2020, however, the seals have returned. They never were extirpated from Canada and certain pockets of the Maine coast, and thus an important mother population was created from whence the species could reclaim the home of their ancestors. Currently, they are sighted as far south as the barrier islands of North Carolina on a regular basis, with Massachusetts being the southernmost point of known pupping areas along the Atlantic Coast.https://coastalstudies.org/seal-research/cape-cod-seals/ Harbor seals move south from eastern Canadian waters to breed along the coast of Maine, Cape Cod, and the South Shore in Massachusetts in May and June, and return northward in fall. Others will head south from these areas to \\"vacation\\" in warmer waters , particularly young seals unable to compete with adults for food and territory; they do not return north until spring. One park ranger in New York City, which is dead center of its West Atlantic range, is recorded as saying \\"New York is like their Miami resort.\\" This refers to the habit of young seals leaving Cape Cod and even some Arctic waters to inhabit the harbor in winter. In 2018 the New York Post reported that the harbor is now \\"cleaner than it has been in 110 years,\\" and since the first decade of the 21st century, the harbor seal has found the old turf of its ancestors to be a land of plenty and the water to be livable. Within sight of the New York skyline, known colonies of harbor seals are found on Hoffmanhttps://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/25/nyregion/swimmers-from-the-north- delight-scientists-and-sightseers.html and Swinburne Islandshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI5lSnhA-es as well as portions of Red Hook and Staten Island, readily hauling out every from October until very early May. Known favorite foods of the seal are returning in grand numbers to New York Harbor as well as nearby New Jersey, from Raritan Bay all the way down the entire Jersey Shore, with schools of mossbunker regularly attracting, in addition to harbor seals, their cousin the grey seals as well as dolphins and, most recently, whales. Both the northern and southern shores of Long Island have a reliable population of harbor seals as well as greys, where they will take sand lance as well as some species of crab as part of their diet.

He is best known for his use of Plasticine as his artistic medium in the creation of textured ‚Äòpaintings‚Äô. Hudson's most notable exhibition to date was The Rise and Fall of Young Sen ‚Äì The Contemporary Artist‚Äôs Progress, which was shown at Sotheby's SI2 Gallery, London in May 2015. The exhibition consisted of ten large scale Plasticine paintings, depicting a contemporary version of William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress. According to the New York Times, all ten paintings were sold prior to the show opening. Biography Hudson grew up in Yorkshire and attended Ampleforth College. He graduated from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in 2005 after taking a foundation degree at Chelsea College of Art and Design. His father is sculptor, Richard Hudson. Artwork Hudson makes paintings, sculpture, etchings and performance based work. For the past seven years, his medium of choice has been Plasticine. In The Telegraph newspaper Hudson explains ‚ÄúI did performance as a student, but when I left I was broke and looking to make things I could sell. I‚Äôve always loved the impasto painters: Leon Kossoff, Frank Auerbach, anyone a bit gloopy. So Plasticine felt like something I could run with.‚Äù In the New York Times Hudson was quoted as saying that ‚Äúthere are certain things you can do with Plasticine that you can‚Äôt do with paint‚Äù, the writer Laura K. Jones has said that Hudson's use of Plasticine creates paintings that look ‚Äúmore like oil paintings than oil paintings themselves‚Äù and the critic Richard Dormant has described Hudson as an ‚Äúastonishing young painter‚Äù. Hudson's work is concerned with ideas of Britishness and contemporary culture. His most recent series, The Rise and Fall of Young Sen ‚Äì The Contemporary Artist‚Äôs Progress, satirises social stereotypes and the vulgarity that can stem from wealth, frame and consumer culture. Dylan Jones wrote in GQ magazine: ‚Äúthe pictures are saturated with contemporary cultural references ‚Äòsatirising the absurdity of modern life, from political issues to social stereotypes and the contemporary art world‚Äô‚Äù. Hudson also often pays tribute other artists from history either through emulating their style or re- appropriating their compositions. Examples include Van Gogh, Hieronymus Bosch as well as William Hogarth. A Rake Revisited Hudson‚Äôs series, A Rake Revisited, which was shown at the Sir John Soane's Museum in London 2011, also appropriated Hogarth‚Äôs A Rake's Progress but with Hudson himself characterised as the main character, Tom Rakewell. The director of the museum at the time, Tim Knox, explained to Cassone magazine ‚ÄúThere is a pervasive sense of fear that is even more tangible in Hudson‚Äôs Plasticine clad canvases than in the original paintings. His work both subverts and celebrates Hogarth‚Äôs originals, adding his own story to a work which has become enmeshed in our culture, part of our national consciousness. He embellishes and exaggerates and makes these images from nearly three centuries ago alive for us again, inviting us to look just as acutely at the state of our nation today.‚Äù The artist Marc Quinn has said, ‚ÄúHudson aligns himself with an irreverent and eccentric British tradition in art that is really the saviour of it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a lineage of non- conformity yet quintessentially Britishness that is unique‚Ä¶ Hudson has reinvented this tradition in his visual, trembling, vibrating, sculpted paintings.‚Äù The Director of Sotheby's SI2 gallery Fru Tholstrup described Hudson to Wall Street International as ‚Äúone of the most innovative young artists working today‚Äù. She went on to say that ‚Äúthrough his painterly application of Plasticine, Hudson has developed a truly unique artistic language‚Äù. Damien Hirst has described Hudson as ‚ÄúF***ing mad‚Äù. Collectors Notable collectors of Hudson's work include Marc Quinn, Robert Hiscox, Jay Jopling, Mario Testino, Tim Jeffries, Tommy Hilfiger and Mark Hix. Hudson has also been photographed by photographers Gautier De Blonde for The Telegraph and David Bailey for GQ. Hudson has had numerous solo and group shows in London, Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, Paris, New York, Miami and Milan at venues including TJ Boulting (formerly Trolley Gallery), Sir John Soane's Museum, 20 Hoxton Square, F2 Gallery, Christie's, 33 Portland Place, Fine Art Society and as part of the Hiscox Collection. Recent In 2016 Hudson's exhibited at Carl Kosty√°l Gallery, London and Sotheby's SI2 gallery in New York. He was recently nominated from Pulse Miami Beach art prize for a series of Woodburytype prints. Thames & Hudson published an 8-page profile on Hudson in the publication London Burning by Maryam Eisler, where Henry paid tribute to the vices of Hogarth's Tom Rakewell. The last photograph in the series depicted Hudson lying naked on William Hogarth's grave in Chiswick, London. In April 2015, Sotheby's published a feature on Henry Hudson in coordination with his show at Sotheby's S2 Gallery titled, Henry Hudson: The Contemporary Artist's Progress - The Rise and Fall of Young Sen. In an essay about Hudson Nimrod Kamer described him as a 'champagne fascist'. In 2015 he was extensively interviewed by GQ Magazine, with Dylan Jones describing Hudson as an 'iconic' artist\\". In March 2016 he was profiled by Flora Alexandra Ogilvy for The Gentleman's Journal magazine. On June 2020, following the Covid-19 pandemic, Hudson painted a mural in Roman Road, East London, touching on the coronaVirus as well as Black Lives Matter and the controversial 5G antennas surrounding the area. Hudson currently lives and works in London.

Career In 1902 he received his doctorate from the University of Freiburg, receiving his MD in 1905 and subsequently working at the Herzberge asylum in Berlin- Lichtenberg. In 1923 he began work as an assistant to Karl Bonhoeffer (1868-1948) at the Charit√©-Berlin. In 1927 he became an associate professor. An early interest in criminal psychology reportedly developed while in charge of high-secure wards for criminal and dangerous patients between 1908 and 1919. In 1930 he was appointed medical director of the Heil- und Pflegeanstalt in Berlin, but because of his Jewish heritage was dismissed from his position after the Nazi takeover of Germany. In 1939 he emigrated to the United States, where he worked as a lecturer at the New School for Social Research in New York City. From 1940 he also worked at the municipal medical department of Philadelphia. Birnbaum's primary research was in the fields of clinical psychiatry, criminal psychology (forensic psychiatry, psychopathy and psychopathology). Theories=Psychopathy Birnbaum was an influential writer on psychopathy, then having a very broad usage perhaps more equivalent to the category of personality disorders today, especially in regard to criminology. Millon, Simonsen and Birket-Smith have stated that \\"K. Birnbaum (1909), writing in Germany at the time of Kraepelin's later editions, was the first to suggest that the term \\"sociopathic\\" might be the most apt designation for the majority of these cases\\"Historical Conceptions of Psychopathy in the United States and Europe in Psychopathy: Antisocial, Criminal, and Violent Behavior, Editors Theodore Millon, Erik Simonsen, Morten Birket-Smith, Roger D. Davis, Guilford Press, 2002. Citing: Birnbaum, K (1909) Die psychopathiscene verbrecker. Leipzig: Thieme. The term sociopathy would later gradually become popular in America, especially as expounded by psychologist George E. Partridge (1930) and adopted into early versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and is still referred to as an alternative term for antisocial personality disorder. Birnbaum proposed several subtypes of sociopathy and argued that while there may be varying degrees of 'constitutional' disposition towards disorders that could lead to maladjustment and crime, it was the effect of social forces and environments which shaped the eventual outcome.Richard F. Wetzell (2000) Inventing the criminal: a history of German criminology, 1880-1945 Birnbaum published in 1914 a large encyclopedic volume on criminal psychopaths, a second and revised edition of which would be released in 1926. Reviewers at the time noted different themes--a view of constitutional psychopathy as a form of degeneration with both inherited (genetic 'taint') and prenatally acquired (through injury to 'germ plasm') types, resulting in a disposition towards mental disorder or a reduced capacity to resist anti-social tendencies; rejection of the term 'inferiors' for this category; a view that emotion is central to the disorder rather than necessarily deficient intellect; description of nearly 20 subtypes of psychopathic personalities (more akin to personality disorders than psychopathy as often defined today); a pivotal role for life events and social conditions in shaping whether someone with various psychopathic dispositions would end up engaging in antisocial or criminal behavior or not, and an insistence that even lifelong criminality does not necessarily mean underlying psychopathy.Full Text Review of: Karl Birnbaum's Book (Volume 3 of a compendium with other authors) 'Psychopathic Criminals' (1914) H.

In 1930 in an article 'The Social Significance of the Psychopathic', Birnbaum defined psychopaths as anyone who shows 'in a moderate degree dispositionally conditioned, 'constitutional', psychic deviations, and especially...in the sphere of character'. He stated this sufficiently distinguished psychopaths from the 'really insane', though not necessarily from the 'normal'.The Social Significance of the Psychopathic Karl Birnbaum. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science July 1930 149: 70-79 By 1949, now in America, Birnbaum writes in regard to pathological Juvenile delinquency about the importance of considering both an immaturity of the personality from within, and environmental influences from without, and the complex interactions and pathways to conditions that result.A Court Psychiatrist's View of Juvenile Delinquents Karl Birnbaum, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 1949 vol. 261 no. 1 55-63 doi: 10.1177/000271624926100107 Pathogenesis and Pathoplasticity Birnbaum in 1923 also coined a distinction between pathogenic and pathoplastic factors, in his work The making of a psychosis: the principles of structural analysis in psychiatry. The term pathogenic was used to refer to what causes the essential structure of a pathology, and pathoplastic to what causes the variation in the disorder between individuals or cultures.Philosophy of Psychiatry Murphy, Dominic.

It has recently been pointed out that the distinction has generally been used to report Culture-bound syndromes in non-Western countries, despite western culture also causing its own unique forms of disorders. Moreover, cultural factors could be pathogenic as well as pathoplastic, for example by influencing epigenetic and associated neuronal processes.Epigenetics and its implications for Psychology H√©ctor Gonz√°lez- Pardo and Marino P√©rez √Ålvarez, Universidad de Oviedo.

It is located at the southern edge of the Old Town, adjacent to George Heriot's School. Burials have been taking place since the late 16th century, and a number of notable Edinburgh residents are interred at Greyfriars. The Kirkyard is operated by City of Edinburgh Council in liaison with a charitable trust, which is linked to but separate from the church. The Kirkyard and its monuments are protected as a category A listed building. History Greyfriars takes its name from the Franciscan friary on the site (the friars of which wear grey habits), which was dissolved in 1560. The churchyard was founded in August 1562 after Royal sanction was granted to replace the churchyard at St Giles Cathedral. { width=\\"100%\\"  } Greyfriars Kirkyard with Edinburgh Castle behind \\"Non Omnis Moriar\\" (Not All of Me Will Die), Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh Hill & Adamson photograph dated 1848, showing D O Hill sketching at the Dennystoun Monument, watched by the Misses MorCris. The Kirkyard was involved in the history of the Covenanters. The Covenanting movement began with signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirk on 28 February 1638. Following the defeat of the militant Covenanters at Bothwell Brig in 1679, some 1200 Covenanters were imprisoned in a field to the south of the churchyard. When, in the 18th century, part of this field was amalgamated into the churchyard as vaulted tombs the area became known as the \\"Covenanters' Prison\\". During the early days of photography in the 1840s the kirkyard was used by David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson as a setting for several portraits and tableaux such as The Artist and The Gravedigger. Covenanters James Guthrie, James Renwick, the Marquis of Argyll and the other Covenanters who died during 'The Killing Time' (1661‚Äì88) The National Covenant was signed in the graveyard (as it was a place of legal free public assembly) in 1638. Whilst some depictions of the event show them leaning on table-stones, these stones did not exist at that time and the signing was done during the period of ban on central gravestones.Greyfriars Parish Burial Records:1560‚Äì1900 Following the Battle of Bothwell Bridge (22 June 1679), some 1200 prisoners were brought to Edinburgh. Their being too numerous for containment in the prison or castle a makeshift \\"prison\\" was formed in a field south of Greyfriars Kirkyard, to hold around 400 not containable elsewhere. This area was conveniently enclosed on two sides by the Flodden Wall and on a third side (the west) by the high enclosing wall of George Heriot's School. The fourth side faced the churchyard and was separated by an easily patrolled and guarded picket fence. The name Covenanters Prison stuck. The bulk of the area was built on by the city Bedlam (around 1690). A remaining strip of land, sandwiched between the Bedlam and George Heriot's School, was used for additional burial ground from around 1700. The style at the time was to build in enclosed vaults, and this is the dominant form in this section. As the vaults did not exist at the time of the area's prison use, despite their potential to be used as prison cells, this was never the case. The area was open to public view until around 1990, but was thereafter locked by City of Edinburgh Council to stem persistent vandalism and use by drug-users. The area is accessible during the day by special arrangement with the guides at Greyfriard Kirkhttps://greyfriarskirk.com/visit-us/kirkyard/ during their opening hours and at night by going on a City of the Dead Tour where the Black Mausoleum can be visited.http://www.cityofthedeadtours.com Greyfriars Bobby The graveyard is associated with Greyfriars Bobby, the loyal dog who guarded his master's grave. Bobby's headstone at the entrance to the Kirkyard, erected by the Dog Aid Society in 1981, marks his reputed burial place, however as there are no parts of the kirkyard that is not consecrated it is also believed he was buried under a tree outside the gates to the right of the current main entrance. The dog's statue is opposite the graveyard's gate, at the junction of George IV Bridge and Candlemaker Row. The grave of a Pentland Hills Shepherd, \\"Auld Jock\\" (John Gray), where the dog famously slept for 14 years, lies on the eastern path, some 30m north of the entrance. The stone is modern, the grave originally being unmarked. Monuments Mortsafes to deter 'resurrectionists' from exhuming the dead, before the 1832 Anatomy Act regulated the legal supply of corpses for medical purposes. Enclosed burial lairs are found mainly on the south edge of the graveyard and in the \\"Covenanters' Prison\\". These either have solid stone walls or iron railings and were created as a deterrent to grave robbing, which had become a problem in the eighteenth century. Greyfriars also has two low ironwork cages, called mortsafes. These were leased, and protected bodies for long enough to deter the attentions of the early nineteenth-century resurrection men who supplied Edinburgh Medical College with corpses for dissection. The kirkyard displays some of Scotland's finest mural monuments from the early 17th century, rich in symbolism of both mortality and immortality such as the Death Head, Angel of the Resurrection and the King of Terrors. These are mostly found along the east and west walls of the old burial yard to the north of the kirkyard.C.Golledge (2018) Greyfriards Graveyard, Amberley Publishing Notable monuments include the Martyr's Monument, which commemorates executed Covenanters. The Italianate monument to Sir George Mackenzie was designed by the architect James Smith, and modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro, designed by Donato Bramante.Gifford, John (1989) William Adam 1689‚Äì1748, Mainstream Publishing / RIAS. pp.62‚Äì67 Duncan Ban MacIntyre's memorial was renovated in 2005, at a cost of about ¬£3,000, raised by a fundraising campaign of over a year. The monument of John Byres of Coates, 1629, was one of the last works of the royal master mason William Wallace. Bloody MacKenzie's Tomb The distinctive domed tomb of Sir George MacKenzie has long had an association with rumours of ghosts. In 2003 two teenage boys, aged 17 and 15, entered the tomb via a ventilation slot in the rear (now sealed). They reached the lower vault (containing the coffins), broke the coffins open and stole a skull. Police arrived as they were playing football with the skull on the grass. The pair narrowly escaped imprisonment on the little-used but still extant charge of violating sepulchres.

Shareholder rebellion may occur at an annual general meeting or through a proxy battle. Shareholders may also threaten to collapse a firm's stock price through concentrated selling. In 1998, the Rockefeller family led a shareholder revolt against Exxon over its climate change policy. In 2005, Michael Eisner retired after Walt Disney's nephew, Roy Disney, led a shareholder revolt, claiming Eisner was a micromanager who had caused a creative brain drain. In 2010, British Petroleumhttp://priceofoil.org/2010/02/08/now-bp-faces-shareholder-revolt- over-tar-sands/ and Shell faced a shareholder revolt over their Canadian tar sands policy.

She operated as the Renfrew Ferry between Renfrew and Yoker until mid 2010 when she became the Arranmore ferry carrying up to 3 cars. Since 2016, she has operated the Cromarty to Nigg ferry. History Renfrew Rose was designed by Ian Nicolson and built in 1984 by MacCrindle Shipbuilding Ltd, Ardrossan. Service Renfrew Rose and her sister ship, MV Yoker Swan, were operated by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) as the Renfrew Ferry. Crossing the River Clyde between the area of Yoker in Glasgow and the town of Renfrew in Renfrewshire, it is the last operational Clyde crossing this far upstream, and the closest to Glasgow City Centre. SPT announced on 22 January 2010 that the service was to close at the end of March 2010. They withdrew the service as part of moves to save ¬£2.5m. The two vessels were approaching the end of their working life, and it was estimated that it would cost ¬£2 million to replace them. Alternative services were investigated and a smaller passenger ferry replaced them as the Clydelink service. After the SPT service ended, Renfrew Rose and her sister, Yoker Swan were purchased by the Arranmore Fast Ferry company for use on the Burtonport to Arranmore island route in County Donegal, Ireland. Repainted in their blue and white livery, they now carry up to 3 cars. In May 2016, Renfrew Rose was purchased by the Highland Ferry company to operate the Cromarty to Nigg ferry service, linking the Black Isle to Easter Ross. This service was previously run by Cromarty Rose (from 1986 to 2010), and Cromarty Queen (from 2011 until 2014). Layout The ferry has a front ramp, which is accessed directly from the concrete slipways on both sides of the river. These give access to the front deck and an enclosed passenger cabin, which provides some shelter during the 2-minute crossing.

Biography Skar was born at √òyer in Oppland, Norway. He was the son of Ole Torsteinsson Skar (1802-1886) and Mari Johannesdotter L√•nke (1814-1894). His brother was educator Matias Skard (1846‚Äì1927). He was raised in the traditional region of Gudbrandsdalen and attended the Latin School in Lillehammer (Lillehammer latinskole). He later studied at the University of Christiania where he took his degree in 1860. As an educator, he first worked as a children's tutor. From 1883 to 1892, he taught at Bruuns Folk School (Bruuns folkeh√∏gskule) in Sel and Gausdal. The school was operated by his brother-in-law, folk school pioneer Christopher Bruun (1839-1920). Skar collected folklore throughout his adult life. These works includes legends, fairy tales, proverbs, riddles, nursery rhymes and songs. In 1881, on the initiative of J√∏rgen Moe (1813-1882) and J√∏rgen L√∏vland (1848-1922), he received a private grant from citizens in Kristiansand to continue his for his collection efforts. The following year he received a scholarship from the university at Christiania. In 1897 at age 59, he was granted a state scholarship which provided financial support for the remainder of his life. He then moved back to Setesdal. In 1876, he published a book which contains information about life and folklore in Gudbrandsdalen. Olaf Norli (1861-1959) was the publisher for the main body of his work. His main contribution to Norwegian literature is the work Gamalt or S√¶tesdal (1903-1916), a collection of eight volumes of the old peasant culture in the valley of Setesdal. These are works of cultural history with a prominent portion about the older folk culture in Setesdal built on the valley's pastoral past. Two volumes were published after his death. He died at Bygland in Aust-Agder during 1914. He was buried in the cemetery of √Ördal Church at Grendi in Bygland. A bust of Johannes Skar was designed by sculptor Dyre Vaa (1903‚Äì1980) and cast in bronze. It was erected in the churchyard of √Ördal Church in 1924.

She is most famous for her Burmese covers of Euro disco and American rock and pop songs as well as classic Burmese songs from the pre- and post-war eras. May Sweet was the dominant female singer of Burmese pop music from the late 1970s to the 1980s, bridging popular singers from the 1970s like Nwe Yin Win and L Khun Yi to Maykhala, her main rival in the mid-1980s, and to Hayma Ne Win and Connie in the late 1980s. She also collaborated with other male singers, most notably with Kaiser. She achieved immense popularity starting in the late 1970s with a series of repackaged Western cover albums called Panthi Thachinmya (lit. Apple Songs), written by successful cover songwriter Thukhamein Hlaing, and a series of classic Burmese cover albums produced by Maung Kyemon. Her covers, some of which were originally written for male singers, often became more popular than the original covers. She also had many successful \\"original\\" songs as she was the top choice of songwriters of the day. Her most famous song, or her signature song, is Maung. At the peak of her popularity in the early to mid-1980s, the fourth daughter of five-time Myanmar Academy Award winner Myint Myint Khin also starred in a number of films where she appeared with leading men of the day like Pyay Nyein and Kyaw Thu. In the 1990s, she chose to focus on her music career, and stopped making films. Though the Burmese pop music scene had changed from slow rock/pop to Europop, techno, heavy metal and hip- hop, she stayed with her tried-and-true pop ballads. With her strong fan base, she was able to keep releasing new albums. Ironically, the next generation of female singers promptly covered many of her popular songs (both covers and originals) though none achieved her success. The songs remain closely identified with her. The longevity of her popularity and dominance at the top remains unparalleled in Myanmar where even most successful female singers do not last more than a few years. To date, she remains the only singer to have achieved success in both Western-style pop and classic Burmese music genres. May Sweet left the Burmese music scene and the country in the late 1990s after she was married to a Burmese-American from New York City in 1997. She resides with her husband in Delaware. They have 1 daughter. She continues to perform for Burmese expatriate audiences around the world. Later, she returned to Myanmar and sings her songs again and make many shows. Now, she is as a judge in Myanmar Idol. Early life Swe Aye Myint was born on 13 February 1962 in Yangon, Myanmar to Myint Myint Khin, a top leading lady of Burmese cinema and a singer, and Khin Maung Nyunt, a lawyer. Swe Aye Myint, nicknamed Mi Swe, was the fourth child of five daughters. Deeply interested in music since childhood, young Mi Swe was able to sing classical Burmese songs called thachingyi by 8. Her singing ability caught the ear of Ba Than, a famous Burmese harp master, and a family friend. Ba Than trained her to play the Burmese harp. Still at age eight, she first made her concert appearance at a Taungoo pagoda festival (Festival of the Twenty Eight Buddhas), singing Nwe Yin Win's famous hit Mimi Lay Ye Maymay Kyaung. May Sweet graduated from the Dagon 1 High School in 1978, and received a bachelor's degree in botany from Yangon University in 1982. Career=Becoming May Sweet Soon after her first stage appearance in 1970, Mi Swe was offered a chance to record a duet song with Nwe Yin Win, another family friend, in Nwe Yin Win's upcoming album. Right before the release of the album, Myint Myint Khin chose a stage name for her daughter. The name was May Sweet, the result of Burmese wordplay (called Zagalein) of the name Mi Swe () to May Sweet (). (Zagalein is similar to vesre in Argentine Spanish, or verlan in French, reversing the sounds of a word or words to produce a slang or colloquial name.) At 14, May Sweet's career began in earnest. She released her first album with Zaw One, one of the leading men of Burmese cinema at that time. Her follow-up album was with her mother, covering many of her mother's hits from the 1950s. Trained in classical Burmese music, May Sweet with the help of noted musician Maung Kyemon turned to old Burmese songs from the pre-war era (1930s) by the great May Shin, and updated them with modern Western music and arrangements. Her covers proved immensely popular, and she became a household name at 17. Film At 17, riding her popularity as a singer, May Sweet entered into a film career, getting the lead role in her first film. She made numerous films opposite the top leading men of the day such as Kyaw Thu, Yan Aung, Zin Wine, Pyay Nyein, and Ye Aung. She never achieved anywhere near her mother's popularity or success in films, and stopped making films when she was about 30. Television career She was involved as a Judge in Myanmar Idol Season 1 (2015-2016). Move to America In 1997, May Sweet married Andrew Lee (also known as Zaw Win), a Burmese American from New York. They first met during one of her trips to the United States where she was invited to perform at a fundraiser for a Burmese monastery. She left for the US soon after. Now working at a middle school in the US, she continues to perform for Burmese expatriate audiences around the world during her time-off. She and her husband have no children. Sweet has twice been the subject of a death hoax. First in 2008 when news of her death was linked to a report purportedly distributed by Associated Press. Secondly in 2011 on the exile-run media web site the Irrawaddy that published a number hoax articles when it was hacked. The singer instantly issued a statement online that the news was a hoax. Album discography May Sweet has recorded dozens of albums and hundreds of songs in many genres in her long career. (In early 2010, she released her first new album in over a decade.)

The signing of the Arusha Accords was welcomed and for the efforts of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and Tanzania in this respect. The conclusion of the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali that the full cooperation of the parties with one another is essential for the United Nations to carry out its mandate. In this regard, UNAMIR was established for a period of six months subject to the proviso that it will be extended beyond the initial ninety days upon a review by the Council as to whether progress had been made towards the implementation of the Arusha Accords. It then decided that UNAMIR should have the following mandate: :(a) contribute to the security of Kigali; :(b) monitor the ceasefire which called for the establishment of cantonment, assembly zones and the demarcation of the new demilitarised zone; :(c) monitor the security situation during the final period of the transitional government's mandate in the lead up to elections; :(d) assist in demining; :(e) investigate non-compliance with the Arusha Accords; :(f) monitor repatriation of Rwandan refugees and resettlement of displaced persons; :(g) assist in the co-ordination of humanitarian assistance; :(h) investigate and report on incidents regarding the activities of the gendarmerie and police. United Nations Observer Mission Uganda‚ÄìRwanda would be integrated into UNAMIR, and the Council further approved Boutros- Ghali's decision stating that the deployment and withdrawal of UNAMIR should be carried out in stages, and in this connection, that UNAMIR's mandate, if extended, would be expected to terminate following national elections and the installation of a new government in Rwanda, scheduled to occur by October 1995. The Secretary-General was authorised to deploy the first contingent of 2,548 troops to Kigali for an initial period of six months, allowing it to establish transitional institutions and implement other provisions of the Arusha Peace Agreement. There he was also asked to report on the progress of UNAMIR and the requirements for its further scale and composition. It also asked him to keep the maximum strength of the mission as low as possible, for example, through a phased deployment, and planning cuts had to be considered. The Secretary-General's intention to appoint a Special Representative who would be leading the mission was welcomed. The Security Council asked him an agreement on the status of the transaction to close within the 30 days was to take effect. Finally, the resolution called upon the parties to guarantee the safety of United Nations personnel and for Member States, specialised agencies and non-governmental organisations to contribute economic, financial and humanitarian assistance for the people and to the democratisation of Rwanda.

It has been defined as the divine influence which operates in humans to regenerate and sanctify, to inspire virtuous impulses, and to impart strength to endure trial and resist temptation;OED, 2nd ed.: grace(n), 11b and as an individual virtue or excellence of divine origin.OED, 2nd ed.: grace(n), 11e Buddhism While many schools of Buddhism emphasize self-discipline and effort as the path to enlightenment, something akin to the concept of divine grace is present as well. One of the most prominent examples of this is the doctrine of the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ branch of Pure Land Buddhism, founded by the 12th-century Japanese monk, Shinran. In Buddhism, the concept of \\"merit\\" refers to the power of good karma built up over time through meditation, effort and spiritual practice- in Japanese, \\"Jiriki,\\" or \\"self-power.\\" This merit can be transferred to other sentient beings by a spiritual adept or bodhisattva, motivated by compassion for all beings cultivated through attaining bodhicitta. For Shinran, this ability to muster up genuine self-directed spiritual attainment is lacking in almost all humans, who are in reality \\"bombu,\\" or foolish beings lost in a sea of delusion and selfishness such that even their good actions are tainted by selfish motivations. The only hope for spiritual advancement is giving up on Jiriki and, through faith, or \\"shinjin,\\" embracing the Tariki, or \\"other- power\\" of an infinitely-compassionate being. This being is Amida Buddha, who countless millennia ago made a primal vow to save all sentient beings by building up enough merit to establish a pure land, into which beings could be reborn simply by invoking his name, and in which they could easily attain full enlightenment. The key difference between Shinran's school and other schools of Pure Land Buddhism is the idea that even this faith and the resulting small effort of reciting Amida's name is impossible without the intervening grace of Amida Buddha working in the deluded human being through the power of Amida's primal vow. Therefore, the recitation of Amida's name is seen more as an expression of gratitude for already-existing grace rather than the self- induced catalyst for a grace not yet present.http://bschawaii.org/shindharmanet/bloom/ab-writings/amazing/ Christianity  Grace in Christianity is the free and unmerited favour of God as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowing of blessings.OED, 2nd ed.: grace(n), 11a Common Christian teaching is that grace is unmerited mercy (favor) that God gave to humanity by sending his Son, Jesus Christ, to die on a cross, thus securing man's eternal salvation from sin. Within Christianity, there are differing concepts of how grace is attained. In particular, Catholics and Reformed Protestants understand the attainment of grace in substantially different ways. It has been described as \\"the watershed that divides Catholicism from Protestantism, Calvinism from Arminianism, modern liberalism from conservatism\\".Charles C. Ryrie, The Grace of God (Chicago: Moody Press, 1963), pp. 10-11. Catholic doctrine teaches that God has imparted Divine Grace upon humanity and uses the vehicle of sacraments, which are carried out in faith, as a primary and effective means to facilitate the reception of his grace.http://www.saintaquinas.com/Justification_by_Grace. html For Catholics, sacraments (carried out in faith) are the incarnational or tangible vehicle through which God's grace becomes personally and existentially received.Edward Schillebeeckx, Christ, the Sacrament of Encounter with God (Rowman & Littlefield, 1963), Foreword pp. 16 Reformed Protestants, generally, do not share this sacramental view on the transmittal of grace, but instead favor a less institutionalized mechanism. For example, in the Catholic Church, the primary initiation into a state of grace is granted by God through baptism (in faith) instead of by a simple prayer of faith (sinner's prayer); although, Catholics would not deny the possible efficacy of even a simple prayer for God's grace to flow (Baptism by desire). In another example, for Catholics, the sacrament of reconciliation (in faith) is the primary means of transmitting grace after a mortal sin has been committed. In the New Testament, the word translated as grace is the Greek word charis (; ), for which Strong's Concordance gives this definition: \\"Graciousness (as gratifying), of manner or act (abstract or concrete; literal, figurative or spiritual; especially the divine influence upon the heart, and its reflection in the life; including gratitude)\\".Strong (2001) Grk entry number 5485 (p. 1653) Spiritual gifts or charismata which comes from the word family charis, is defined in the New Bible Dictionary as \\"grace coming to visible effect in word or deed.\\" A Greek word that is related to charis is charisma (gracious gift). Both these words originated from another Greek word chairo (to rejoice, be glad, delighted).Strong (2001) Grk entry numbers 5486 and 5463 In the Old Testament, the Hebrew term used is chen (), which is defined in Strong's as \\"favor, grace or charm; grace is the moral quality of kindness, displaying a favorable disposition\\".Strong (2001) Hebrew entry number 2580 (p. 1501) In the King James translation, chen is translated as \\"grace\\" 38 times, \\"favour\\" 26 times, twice as \\"gracious\\",Proverbs 11:16 and Ecclesiastes 9:11 once as \\"pleasant\\",Proverbs 5:19 and once as \\"precious\\".Proverbs 17:8  Hinduism  Hindu devotional or bhakti literature available throughout India and Nepal is replete with references to grace (kripa) as the ultimate key required for spiritual self-realization.Descent of divine grace The Hindu, June 30, 2005. Some, such as the ancient sage Vasistha, in his classical work Yoga Vasistha, considered it to be the only way to transcend the bondage of lifetimes of karma. One Hindu philosopher, Madhvacharya, held that grace was not a gift from God, but rather must be earned.Great Thinkers of the Eastern World, Ian McGreal. Islam Salafi scholar Umar Sulayman al-Ashqar, dean of the Faculty of Islamic Law at Zarqa Private University in Zarqa, Jordan, wrote that \\"Paradise is something of immense value; a person cannot earn it by virtue of his deeds alone, but by the Grace and Mercy of Allah.\\" This stance is supported by hadith: according to Abu Huraira, Muhammad once said that \\"None amongst you can get into Paradise by virtue of his deeds alone ... not even I, but that Allah should wrap me in his grace and mercy.\\" The Quran says \\"God is the Possessor of Infinite Grace\\" Quran 62:4 and \\"He bestows this grace upon whomsoever He wills (or desires).\\"Source: Quran 57:29 Grace is something attainable by those here on earth from God who meet certain Quranic criteria.

It is the second oldest professional musical organization in the State of Hawaii. Only the Royal Hawaiian Band, founded in 1836, is older. The Hawaii County Band, based in Hilo, is composed of approximately 40 part-time musicians and a full-time director and is part of the Parks and Recreation Department of the County of Hawaii. The band performs for free at ceremonies, festivals, parades, dedications and many other public events throughout Hawaii Island (variously nicknamed \\"The Orchid Island,\\" \\"The Volcano Island, and \\"The Big Island\\"). The band performs a monthly concert at Mooheau Park in downtown Hilo. Members of the West Hawai'i County Band with director Bernaldo Evangalista The West Hawaii County Band, based in Kailua-Kona on the Kona Coast of Hawaii Island, is an independent sub-unit of the Hawai'i County Band. As a civic band The West Hawaii County Band can be heard at regular monthly concerts in Kailua- Kona as well as performing in numerous parades and civic events on the west side of Hawaii Island. History The Hawaii County Band was founded in 1883 by two brothers from Portugal, Joaquin and Jules Carvalho. They emigrated from the Azores and made a living as barbers in Hilo, on the island of Hawaii. The brothers would close their barbershop, perform at scheduled concerts and go back to cutting hair afterwards. Joaquin was the conductor and Jules played the cornet.Carvalho, Joaquin Jr. (May 29‚ÄìJune 4, 1977), Carvalho Brothers Founded in 1883 What is Now Known As the County Band, Hawaii Tribune-Herald Orchid Isle (Hilo) pp. 2,6 The band survived the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 and the period of the Republic of Hawaii (1894‚Äì1898). It was absorbed by the newly created County of Hawaii during the territorial period (1898‚Äì1959). It was known as the Hilo Band (or the Hilo Portuguese Band). After the creation of the county system in the Territory of Hawaii in 1900 it officially became the Hawaii County Band in 1905.(September 12, 1905), The Hilo Band Becomes A County Band, Hilo Tribune-Herald (now the Hawaii Tribune- Herald) p. 1History of Band in Hawaii County Romantic Story, Hilo Tribune- Herald (now the Hawaii Tribune-Herald), July 30, 1926, pp. 1, 8 After Joaquin died in 1924, the band had several directors. Urban Carvalho, son of co- founder Jules Carvalho, led the band from 1943 to 1963. Frank Vierra went on to become the director of the Royal Hawaiian Band. Directors= Hawaii County Band (Hilo),  There have been 12 directors of the band: # Joaquin Carvalho (1883‚Äì1924) # Paul Tallett (1924‚Äì1925) # Frank Vierra (1925‚Äì1933) # Frank Wrigley (1933‚Äì1938) # Gabriel Wela (1938‚Äì1943) # Urban Carvalho (1943‚Äì1963) # Andres Baclig (1963‚Äì1974) # Armando Mendoza (1974‚Äì1981 / 1983‚Äì1984) # John Hursey (1981‚Äì1983) # David Lorch (1984‚Äì1993) # Wayne Kawakami (1993‚Äì2001) # Paul Arceo (2001‚Äìpresent)  The West Hawaii County Band (Kailua-Kona)  #David Lorch #Gary Ventimiglia #Lisa Archuletta #Charlie Peebles #Lisa Archuletta #Bernaldo Evangelista #Lisa Archuleta #Bernaldo Evangalista (current as of June, 2019) Today Unlike the Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaii County Bands are not full-time bands. Except for the band director, the musicians in the Hawaii County bands are employed by County of Hawaii Department of Parks and Recreation on a part-time basis. Some members have been with the band for many years. One exceptional trombonist in his eighties has been with the band continuously for over 60 years. The West Hawaii County Band also includes a number of volunteer musicians including retired professional musicians, music teachers and others from all walks of life.  Uniforms  Hawaii County Band = The uniform for the Hawaii County Band is a red and white aloha shirt. Cross-striped fabric patterns, similar to those of Scottish kilts, were imported from England in the late 19th century as uniforms for the workers on the sugarcane plantations in Hawaii and are still popular apparel among the locals in Hawaii. = West Hawaii County Band = The uniform for the West Hawaii County Band is currently (June 2019) a blue patterned aloha shirt and white pants. When the band performs as the Hulihe Palace Band the uniform changes to a white aloha shirt with red sash.  Performances  Hawaii County Band = Monthly concerts are at the Mooheau Park bandstand in downtown Hilo, usually on the second Saturday of each month at noon. The Mooheau Park Bandstand is a historic structure dating back to 1904, though some accounts claim the bandstand is even older, making it the performing home of the band for at least 106 years. It is also the center for cultural events, political rallies and other downtown Hilo events. = West Hawaii County Band = Monthly concerts are generally the 3rd Friday of each month and take place at Hale Halawai County Park on Alii Drive in Kailua-Kona.

She founded a summer school at Les Houches in the French Alps. For this and her publications, she was awarded the American Society of the French Legion of Honour 2007 Medal for Distinguished Achievement. Attendees at the summer school included over twenty students who would go on to be Nobel Prize winners, including Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, Georges Charpak, and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, who identify the school for assisting in their success. Biography C√©cile Morette was born in 1922 and brought up in Normandy, where in 1943 she earned her License des Science from the University of Caen. Despite her original intention to become a surgeon, she completed her degree in mathematics, physics, and chemistry due to limited opportunities to attend medical school in France during World War II. Following the completion of her bachelor's degree, Morette entered the University of Paris, where she was studying when her mother, sister, and grandmother were tragically killed in the Allied bombing of Caen to support the D-Day landings. In 1944, while still working toward her doctorate at the University of Paris, Morette took a job at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, then under the direction of Frederic Joliot-Curie. She completed her Ph.D. (Sur la production des m√©sons dans les chocs entre nucl√©ons) in 1947.List of publications, University of Texas, accessed 2015-04-19 In 1948 she was invited to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey by Robert Oppenheimer, who had recently become director of the Institute. While there, she became interested in Richard Feynman's path integral method for computations in quantum mechanics and worked to make this approach rigorous, which ultimately led to wide applications of the Feynman diagrams and the underlying mathematics. She also met her future husband and scientific collaborator, American physicist Bryce DeWitt while at IAS; the couple married in 1951, and would have four children. To revitalize French research in mathematics and physics following the war, DeWitt-Morette established a summer school at Les Houches in the French Alps in 1951. She tells stories of how she obtained the funding by tricking her way into a minister's office and then persuaded her male colleagues to support the idea by pretending that the idea was theirs.C√©cile DeWitt-Morette profile, seniorwomen.com; accessed 18 June 2015. Morette was to lead this school for the next 22 years. The school was able to list twenty former students or lecturers at the school who went on to become Nobel laureates. One winner of the Fields Medal credited the summer school as responsible for his career in mathematics. Nobel laureates Pierre- Gilles de Gennes, Georges Charpak, and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji identified the school as helping with their success. In 1958, NATO funded a series of advanced study centres that were based on Morette's summer school.

Work In 1953 a trustee of the unusual Gravity Research Foundation, Agnew Bahnson, contacted Bryce DeWitt with a proposal to fund a gravity research institute. The proposed name was agreed as the \\"Institute for Field Physics\\" and it was established in 1956 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the direction of Bryce and Morette.Profile, cwp.library.ucla.edu; accessed 18 June 2015. In 1958 C√©cile DeWitt-Morette invited L√©on Motchane to see the Institute of Advanced Study in USA which inspired L√©on Motchane to establish an institute dedicated to fundamental research in three areas: mathematics, theoretical physics, and the methodology of human sciences upon which he later created the Institut des Hautes √âtudes Scientifiques. Expedition to test general relativity In 1972 Morette and her husband led an expedition to Mauritania to confirm that light was deflected in line with the theory of general relativity. These measurements were made during the solar eclipse there. Comparison of the pictures with those made six months later confirmed that, in line with theory, light was indeed bent when passing by massive objects.Archives of American Mathematics Spotlight: The Bryce S.

Its key market is UK education including schools, colleges, universities, government education departments and educational agencies. RM plc employs around 1,700 people, the majority based in the company's headquarters located on Milton Park, near Didcot, Oxfordshire. RM also has offices across the UK (Cheshire, Nottinghamshire, Lanarkshire and London) and a software development facility in India. History The company was founded in 1973 as Research Machines in Oxford, England, by Mike Fischer and Mike O'Regan, respectively graduates of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Initially it traded under the name Sintel as a mail-order supplier of electronic components, mainly dealing with the hobbyist market. With the arrival of microprocessors in the mid-1970s, the company expanded into the design and manufacturing of microcomputers. The company shipped its first computer in 1977Research Machines, \\"Company Profile\\", RM.com, Accessed: 10 March 2009 to a customer in a Local Education Authority and has been involved with educational computing ever since. In the 1980s RM and its rival Acorn Computers sold thousands of computers to schools in the UK as part of the government's Microelectronics Education Programme. A key model of the time was RM's Z80-based RML 380Z. The company was invited to tender to supply the BBC micro but declined on grounds that it was not economically feasible to provide so many features at such a low price and to such a tight schedule. The company floated on the London Stock Exchange in November 1994 under the name RM plc. Mike Fischer was Chief Executive of the Group until 1997. He was succeeded by Richard Girling (1997‚Äì2002), Tim Pearson (2002‚Äì08), Terry Sweeney (2008Research Machines. \\"New CEO in 2008\\", rm.com, Accessed: 10 March 2009‚Äì11), Rob Sirs (2011‚Äì12), Martyn Ratcliffe (2011‚Äì13) and David Brooks (since 2013). In 2003 the company won the contract to deliver online tests for Key Stage 3 ICT. Despite a pilot phase in 2005 involving 45,500 pupils that was judged a success by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority the government cancelled the contract in 2007, shortly before their scheduled introduction. Cuts in the budgets of UK educational establishments in 2011 damaged RM's revenues, leading it to shed hundreds of employees and sell less profitable parts of its business. RM ceased production of computers towards the end of 2013. Business structures RM classifies its business into three areas: RM Education The division that deals with technology infrastructure, software and services ‚Äì including interactive classroom equipment, connectivity, networking software, school management software and support services. RM Resources  This division focuses on products for use in the learning curriculum, primarily from TTS, a company acquired in 2004. RM previously offered products from other classroom resources firms it had acquired: *SpaceKraft Ltd ‚Äì developer and manufacturer of a range of sensory products. Acquired in 2007, sold back to original owners in 2016. *DACTA Ltd ‚Äì distributor of educational products from LEGO, TOLO and BRIO. Acquired in 2007 and sold in 2012. *ISIS Concepts Ltd ‚Äì a UK furniture manufacturer. Acquired in 2009 and sold in 2012. RM Results Deals with the process management and outsourcing for testing and qualifications; data analysis services for teachers, education managers and policy makers. Clients include Cambridge Assessment and the International Baccalaureate. International operations From the mid-1990s the company expanded overseas, with international revenues rising to 12% of the total group's revenue in 2009. A contraction in customer spending in RM's core UK education market and slow growth in the overseas businesses prompted it to divest several of them from 2010. India RM founded its subsidiary RM Education Solutions India in Thiruvananthapuram in 2003 to develop software and provide central corporate functions. In November 2016 it accounted for approximately 36% of the RM Group workforce. Germany In 1993 the company established a subsidiary in Soest, Germany, in order to sell a localized version of RM Net LM, a turnkey Local Area Network product for schools, consisting of file- servers running Microsoft LAN Manager, client PCs running Microsoft Windows 3.1 and including a suite of RM-developed network management applications. Despite a nationwide program of marketing seminars and three pilot sites, RM withdrew within two years. USA RM Educational Software, Inc. was established in 2005 to provide schools and districts in North America with many of the UK software products. It has been inactive since 2011. In 2008 RM purchased and integrated the US interactive classroom provider Computrac and sold it at a loss in 2011. Asia-Pacific RM Asia-Pacific started operations in 1997. A head office was opened in Perth, Australia in February 1999 after being awarded a contract for schools information systems by the Education Department of Western Australia. The company grew to employ 50 staff located in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Wellington (NZ), servicing over 4,000 schools across Australasia and in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore and Taipei. RM Asia-Pacific was sold to Civica in 2011. Middle East, North Africa and South Asia (MENASA) In 2009 the company announced that it was expanding its business into the MENASA region with offices based in Dubai. The company stated that this would be a joint venture: :\\"RM MENASA will, through subsidiaries licensed to trade in each country, provide educational ICT products and services to schools in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia (MENASA). It will be the exclusive distributor of RM's learning technologies products in the MENASA region.\\" This venture was closed down after 12 months. RM computers RM's first computer was the RML 380Z RM manufactured desktop and server computers in its Oxfordshire premises from 1978 until 2014. The first model RM shipped was the RML 380Z, based on the Z80 processor and CP/M operating system. This was followed in 1982 by the Link 480Z, essentially a smaller, diskless 380Z with a simple networking capability, enabling it to use the file storage of a 'parent' 380Z via CP/NET networking software and Zilog Z-Net network hardware. In 1985 RM released the RM Nimbus PC-186, a desktop computer using the Intel 80186 processor, the forerunner of the 286 processor used in the IBM PC/AT that defined 'PC compatibility' as a dominant standard for personal computers for decades to come. As the 80186 processor lacked its successor's protected mode RM's computer was not truly PC compatible but could run some PC software and Microsoft Windows up to 3.0. RM introduced its AX model in 1986, using the Intel 80286 processor. A common use for the AX was as a fileserver, connected to PC-186 clients using MS-Net, Microsoft's network operating system of the time and Z-Net hardware (later optionally via Ethernet). Usually the PC-186 clients were diskless, booting via the network. Diskless client computers that loaded their operating system, applications and user data centrally from fileservers were common in UK education for a further decade, partially to avoid the cost of local storage devices such as hard disks, but also to protect system files, as the client Operating Systems MS-DOS and Windows did not offer access control at the file system level until Windows XP introduced support for NTFS. From the AX model onwards RM computers were PC compatible. The 'X Series' was supplemented by the VX, using the new, 32-bit 80386 processor, marketed as a standalone CAD workstation or network fileserver. RM released M Series computers, primarily used as diskless network clients, using the 80286 and later 80386 processors. These used the Micro Channel architecture that featured in the IBM PS/2, which was faster than the standard ISA architecture, but failed to gain widespread acceptance. RM's fileserver platform became its 'E Series' computers, using the similarly short-lived EISA architecture and using a tower case to allow space for multiple hard disks. These fileservers ran Microsoft LAN Manager (on Microsoft OS/2) preconfigured with client Operating System files (Windows 3.0 and later 3.1) for remote booting and bundled with RM-developed tools for managing network users, client PCs and applications. This was sold as RM Net LM. The success of PC compatibility as a worldwide standard changed RM's focus from complete in- house design of circuit boards, peripherals and firmware to the assembly and integration of hardware components sourced predominantly from the Far East. The hardware within RM server and desktop PCs was no longer significantly different from mainstream PCs from other vendors. In the mid-90s RM released the Window Box system which used Windows 95.TES https://www.tes.com/news/new- platform-departures, as well as RM Connect, its turnkey network solution for education and successor to RM Net LM. RM Connect comprised Microsoft operating systems at the server (Windows NT and successors) and client (Windows 3.11, Windows 95 and successors), in-house coded tools for managing the network, a predefined software configuration and applications such as Microsoft Office. Diskless network client PCs were discontinued as the client operating system from Windows 95 onwards had become too large to transfer over the LAN to multiple PCs in a timely manner, so local hard disks were required. From version 2.4 RM Connect was renamed RM Community Connect. In the new millennium RM offered laptops and tablets that bore its name. These were manufactured by Asus and others. In 2013 RM ceased hardware manufacture to focus on software and services. Software The company offered a range of educational software including the Kaleidos Virtual learning environment, MathsAlive, DiscoverAlive, Living Library and SuccessMaker, as well as an e-book library management system, RM Books, developed for the education market. They also package software titles from other companies to allow easy centralized installation on RM networks. In 2005 RM was awarded the contract for Glow (formally known as Scottish Schools Digital Network (SSDN) National Intranet project). Under the five-year, ¬£37.5 million project, all 32 Local Authorities, over 3,000 schools and over 800,000 education users plus parents had access to Glow. RM Education's current proprietary software offerings are focussed on cloud delivery ‚Äì including RM Unify (IdP and SSO), RM Integris (School MIS), RM Finance, and RM Easimaths.

Connard rose from humble origins to become an eminent artist in oils and watercolours whose commissions brought him royal recognition.  Life and career  Connard left school with the minimum state education and went into the building trade as a house painter.Anonymous (1958). Mr. Philip Connard. An accomplished painter. The Times December 9, 1958,No. 54,329, p 16 He attended evening classes in art and won a scholarship in textile design to the Royal College of Art in London. There he won a prize of ¬£100 which enabled him to go to Paris to study, although he did not stay there as long as he had hoped his money would allow him to. He returned to London where he worked as an illustrator before obtaining a position at the Lambeth School of Art where he taught artists such as Edmund Blampied. While teaching at Lambeth he submitted pictures to the New English Art Club and became known as a painter in oils of romantic decorative landscapes with figures such as pierettes or birds. His compositions were said to be ‚Äògraceful, airy and highly individual in conception‚Äô. Although he was nearly 40 years old when the First World War broke out, Connard volunteered as a private, learned to ride, and fought in France as a member of a gun team in the Royal Field Artillery. He reached the rank of Captain before being invalided out because of severe shell shock. He was later appointed an official war artist to the Royal Navy and painted the surrender of the German ship SMS Goeben and the Zeebrugge raid.Tennyson, Charles (1958). Mr. Philip Connard. The Times December 15, 1958, No. 54,334, p 14 This work for the Navy is in the Imperial War Museum in London. Connard was given a number of important decorative commissions: murals at Windsor Castle; two panels for a ballroom in New Delhi; and a large panel on the subject of England for the Cunard liner, RMS Queen Mary. His work can be found in the Tate Gallery, London; the Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay, Paris;British Art in French Collections, Louvre Museum Database. the National Gallery of Australia, the Royal Academy, London, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; and the National Museum of Wales. Connard was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1918 and became a full Academician in 1925. He was Keeper of the Royal Academy school, the principal tutor, from 1945 to 1949. He was also a full member of the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolours. In 1950 he was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. Connard, meanwhile, did not forget his home town: he was the founding President of The Southport Palette Club, established in 1921 to hold annual exhibitions of the work of local artists, and he retained this position until his death in 1958.Southport Palette Club: 36th Annual Exhibition, Nov. 9th - Dec. 6th, 1959 [exhibition catalogue with notice of Philip Connard's death]. Connard married twice: his first wife, Mary Collyer, with whom he had two daughters, died in 1927; in 1933 he married Georgina Yorke, whom he depicted in many of his later paintings of interiors. He lived for several years in Richmond, Surrey with Scottish artist Anne Finlay.

It was released for the arcade in January 2011 and later ported to Pac-Man Museum for a digital release (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Windows PC) in 2014. Gameplay Up to four players can compete at once, choosing a game length of between three and nine rounds. Each player controls a differently coloured Pac-Man character; a single player faces one computer- controlled Pac-Man opponent. The players move throughout a maze, avoiding ghosts and attempting to eat dots and power pellets scattered throughout. New dots and pellets appear whenever the players eat them all. In addition; if any player eats a bonus item that appears next to the ghosts' cage, all remaining dots and pellets are immediately removed and replaced. When a Pac-Man eats a power pellet, he grows in size and can eat the ghosts and any un-powered Pac- Men until the pellet wears off. During this time, the un-powered Pac-Men turn blue but retain an outline of their original colour, and they cannot eat ghosts. Un-powered Pac-Men are eliminated from the round when they either run into a ghost or are eaten by a powered Pac-Man. If two Pac-Men of equal strength run into each other, they are knocked backward a short distance but suffer no harm otherwise. Blue Pac-Men cannot knock or pass through each other. Each round lasts a maximum of two minutes, with an on-screen countdown for the last 10 seconds. The last remaining Pac-Man wins the round. All players are brought back into the game at the start of each new round; after the final round, the player with the most victories is the overall winner.

History The first section of the Merthyr, Tredegar and Abergavenny Railway from Abergavenny to was opened on 29 September 1862. The line was leased and operated by the London and North Western Railway which acquired the smaller railway company on 30 June 1866. Beaufort station opened on 1 March 1864. It became a junction station on 2 September 1867 with the opening of a branch to Ebbw Vale. The station nameboards read \\"Change for Ebbw Vale\\" even though the branch service started at Brynmawr. Beaufort was busy with Ebbw Vale traffic until as there was a daily service to and from Brynamwr of over thirty trains. Ebbw Vale was reached by the Beaufort Viaduct before reaching Ebbw Vale Junction and the Rhyd Viaduct. Ebbw Vale station was near the area which is known locally as 'The Crossing', in the town centre. Beaufort station was situated in a cutting to the west of a road bridge. It stood opposite the Beaufort Ballroom and adjacent to the Beaufort Arms Public House. It had two platforms accessible by flights of steps leading down from the road bridge. The main station building was built of stone, with a timber waiting shelter was provided on the opposite platform. As Beaufort is situated above sea level, harsh winters such as that of 1946-47 could result in the cutting being blocked with snow. The line to Ebbw Vale closed on 2 April 1951. The Abergavenny line was the next to close when passenger services ceased on 4 January 1958. The last passenger service over the line was an SLS railtour on 5 January 1958 hauled by GWR 6959 No. 7912 Little Linford Hall. Final closure came on 2 November 1959 when coal traffic from ceased. Present The station site has been obliterated following realignment of the junction of the A4047 and B4560 at . In addition, the cutting which held the station has been infilled to road level.

He made his professional debut in 1968, reaching the top makuuchi division in 1976. His highest rank was sekiwake and he won three special prizes and two kinboshi. He was well-known for his good looks and flamboyant personal life. After retiring in 1989 he became a sumo elder for a short time before leaving the Japan Sumo Association to work as a commentator and television personality. He died of leukemia in 1995. Career At junior high and at high school he did swimming and rugby, but was especially proficient at judo. He made his debut for the Tokitsukaze stable in September 1968. He was called the \\"last disiciple of Futabayama,\\" as the great yokozuna who had founded the stable died at the end of the year. His stable master for most of the rest of his career was the former ≈çzeki Yutakayama. He fought under his real name for his entire career, never adopting a traditional shikona. He was restricted by back problems early in his career, and it took him 40 tournaments from his professional debut to reach the sekitori ranks, but once he got there he was regarded as extremely promising. Emperor Showa, a fan of sumo, asked in Kuruma's j≈´ry≈ç debut of the tournament director Kasugano (ex-yokozuna Tochinishiki) how far he could go, to which Kasugano responded, \\"≈çzeki\\". He made the top makuuchi division in July 1976, and was ranked there for 62 tournaments in total. He won his first sansho or special prize for Fighting Spirit in January 1978, and in the following tournament in March 1978 made his sanyaku debut at komusubi. In this tournament he defeated ozeki Takanohana and Mienoumi and won his first Technique prize. In May he reached what was to be highest rank of sekiwake, which he held for just one tournament. He won his second Technique prize in May 1981 and reached the komusubi rank on several more occasions, but was never to return to the sekiwake rank. He earned two kinboshi for defeating yokozuna as a maegashira (Wajima in September 1978 and Wakanohana in May 1981). However, those were his only two wins against yokozuna in 44 attempts, and he was unable to defeat Kitanoumi in 17 bouts. His final appearance in the top division was in May 1988. For much of his top division career he had been the only Shiga Prefecture native, but his demotion coincided with the beginning of Shiga-born Misugisato's top division career. Kurama was a highly popular wrestler, and was regarded as one of the most handsome rikishi of his time (alongside Wakanohana II). His failure to make ≈çzeki (for which Kasugano eventually apologized to the Emperor for making an incorrect prediction) was put down to Kurama's flashy personal life, which included driving Lincoln Continentals, spending a million yen a night going out, building a mansion named after himself in Ichikawa, and marrying the actress Yayoi Watanabe. He was also involved in an accident in 1985 when he crashed into two cars waiting at a traffic light, which contributed to the Sumo Association introducing a ban on wrestlers driving. Retirement from sumo He retired in September 1989, and was the oldest man in any of the professional sumo divisions at the time. His retirement followed a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Shikoroyama, but left his role in 1990 due to ill health. He became a tarento, wrote a number of sumo books and was a sumo commentator. At this time there was a boom in sumo's popularity generated by the rise of the Takahanada and Wakahanada brothers. During this period his illness was kept secret from the public and known only to close relatives. A bone marrow transplant was a possibility, with his brother a match, but also risky with only a 50 percent success rate and immediate death if a failure, and so he decided to continue with chemotherapy instead. Death He died of leukemia in January 1995 at the age of 42. His wife wrote a best-selling book about their struggles with his illness, which was also turned into a TV drama. She continues to operate a chankonabe restaurant called Chanko Kurama in Chiba Prefecture. Kurama‚Äôs older brother runs a different restaurant with the same name in Ritto. Fighting style He was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, who preferred fighting on mawashi or belt with a hidari-yotsu or right hand outside grip. His favourite techniques or kimarite were yori-kiri (force out) and uwatenage (overarm throw).

Prostitutes could be easily found in the brothels in the area, where they waited for customers in plain view. In 1991 the Taiwanese government outlawed prostitution. Snake Alley got its nickname due to the numerous restaurants serving snake meat in the past. Previously, snake-meat restaurants would get attention from passersby by putting on performances where handlers would kill and skin live snakes. However,the government banned performances in the 2000s, both to adhere with Article 13 of Taiwan's Animal Protection Act, as well as appease the public's growing concerns about animal welfare.

The organization was founded in 2004 by Steve and Diana Newton with the assistance of Joseph and Sharon Newton and the entire Newton family. It is not related to the military decoration designated the Silver Star. Historical background The tradition of a service banner with a blue star covered with silver threads to represent wounded service personnel began in 1917 or 1918 following the suggestion of Women's Committee of the Council of National Defenses, but faded from use sometime between World War I and World War II. When the use of Blue and Gold Star Service Banners was formally adopted into the United States Code and made official, the tradition of the Silver Star Banner was overlooked. The Department of Defense, given the authority to govern the use of the service banners, concluded that existing Blue Star Service Banner or Gold Star Service Banners and Flags could not be altered. A new Silver Star Service Flag and Banner were designed and were quickly accepted widely used throughout the United States. The Silver Star Service Flag/Banner are trademarked. The name \\"Silver Star Service Banner\\" is TM. The actual Silver Star Service Banner is 8.5\\" x 14.\\" The Silver Star Service Banner Footnote to service banner history: there is also a \\"War Mothers\\" Flag that was first flown over the capitol on Veterans Day in 1926. This Flag is still flown every year on Veterans Day starting at 11 minutes after 11 o'clock to sundown. Usage The Silver Star Service Flag and Banner are symbols to remind Americans of the sacrifice made for them by so many. The Silver Star Service Banner is reserved for those who have been wounded, contracted a serious illness or injury in a war zone. The Silver Star Service Flag may be flown by anyone as a symbols of remembrance and honor. It may be flown during war or peacetime. If flown with the United States Flag, the Silver Star Service Flag must be lower and/or of a smaller size than the United States Flag. Disposal methods are the same as those of the United States Flag. Qualifications for receiving the Silver Star Service Banner are located here: Note: The grommets from a properly disposed of Flag can be cleaned and given as recognition for service. Silver Star Service Banner Day It was also believed that there should be a day set aside to remember the sacrifices of the wounded and ill: So the SSFOA petitioned the states to make May 1 Silver Star Service Banner Day. The United States Flag and the Silver Star Service Flag To date, 50 states, Guam, Saipan, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Chickasaw Nation and the District of Columbia has issued proclamations recognizing the Silver Star Families of America and Silver Star Service Banner Day. Over 2,900 cities and counties have also signed on. The State of Missouri has made the day into law. Silver Star Service Banner Day is now in the United States Congress. On April 21, 2010, the United States House of Representatives passed H Res. 855, a stand-alone resolution, making the SSFOA Silver Star Service Banner official and making May 1 Silver Star Service Banner Day. \\"Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the designation of ‚ÄòSilver Star Service Banner Day‚Äô and calls upon the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\\".

Planning When it was decided that the old JECL complex was to be demolished, the European Commission signalled its interest in purchasing the property in order to build a new EU conference centre on the site.

AXA instead decided to built an ordinary office building. Construction and inauguration Triangle building under construction in 2007, as seen in the distance across the Parc du Cinquantenaire. The main structure of the present triangular building was completed in 2009.

In the centre is a large circular courtyard which is heavily planted and, in 30 years from its construction, the architect insisted it will look \\"magnificent\\". Axa intended to split the complex between the Commission, national embassies and private companies. However the Commission refused to share the building. Negotiations became drawn out but as of August 2010 the Commission and Axa were close to a signature for the whole building.

French explorer Fran√ßois Simars de Bellisle described them as agriculturalists in 1718 and 1720.\\"Bidai Indians.\\" Texas State Historical Association. (retrieved 14 March 2010) They had three distinct villages or bands in the 18th century. The Deadose were the northernmost band of Bidai, who broke off in the early 18th century. The 18th century population of Bidai is estimated to be 600 with 200 additional Deadoses.Sturtevant, 662 In 1770, the band colluded with French settlers to sell guns to the Lipan Apaches, as all parties were enemies with the Spanish. The Bidai suffered several epidemics during 1776-77, reducing their population by at least half. The survivors joined neighboring tribes, such as the Akokisas and Koasati. Some settled on the Brazos Indian Reservation in present-day Young County, Texas and were removed with the Caddo to Indian Territory. Those that remained formed a village twelve miles from Montgomery, Texas, growing corn and picking cotton for hire in the mid-19th century. Andre Sjoberg published an ethnohistory of the Bidai in 1951.Sturtevant, 663 Lifeways The Bidai hunted, gathered, fished, grew maize, and bartered their surplus maize. They snared game and trapped them in cane pens. During the summer months, they lived along the coasts, but in winters they moved inlandSturtevant, 661 in which they lived in bearskin tents. Before contact, the Bidai made their own ceramics, but quickly adopted metal utensils from European trade. They still made ceramic pots into the 19th century, and they also wove a variety of baskets. In 1803, Henry Hopkins Sibley wrote that Bidai had \\"an excellent character for honesty and punctuality.\\" The structure of their cradleboards altered the shape of their skulls. They also enhanced their appearance through body and facial tattooing. Bidai medicine men were herbalists and performed sweatbathing.

Sir William Oliphant of Newton (Lord Newton), Lord Advocate of Scotland was father of the first baronet. Sir William Oliphant is credited with introducing the process of cross-examining witnesses in court, rather than the previous process of extracting testimonials from witnesses, which were then read out in court. Their principal seat was at Newton, in the parish of Forgandenny.Dictionary of National Biography (1885). The Complete Baronetage states that this baronetcy (in Nova Scotia was purchased on 28 July 1629; was sealed on 24 August 1629, is destined to heirs male whatsoever and is not evident in the Register of the Great Seal.

Hoey, 305 U.S. 188 (1938), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that property received by an heir under a settlement agreement resolving a dispute over the decedent's will is property acquired by \\"inheritance,\\" which exempts the value of such property from the income tax..  Background  The Petitioner was a grandson of Mary B. Longyear, who died in 1931, a resident of Massachusetts, leaving as her heirs four surviving children and the petitioner and his brother, who were sons of a deceased daughter. In her will, the decedent gave to her heirs certain small legacies. The entire residuary estate, amounting to more than $3,000,000, was bequeathed to an Endowment Trust, the income from which was payable to another trust described as the Longyear Foundation. The main purpose of the Longyear Foundation was to preserve \\"the records of the earthly life of Mary Baker Eddy,\\" the founder of the Christian Science religion. When the will was offered for probate in Massachusetts, there was objection by the heirs upon the grounds, among others, of lack of testamentary capacity and undue influence. After a hearing, the probate court granted a motion for the framing of issues for trial before a jury. In that situation, a compromise agreement was entered into between the heirs, the legatees, the devisees, and the executors under the will and the Attorney General of Massachusetts. This agreement provided that the will should be admitted to probate and letters testamentary issued; that the specific and pecuniary bequests to individuals should be enforced; that the bequest of the residuary estate to the Endowment Trust should be disregarded; that $200,000 should be paid to the heirs, and a like amount to the Endowment Trust, and that the net residue of the estate, as defined, should be equally divided between the trustees of the Endowment Trust and the heirs. The question presented was whether property received from the estate of a decedent in compromise of a claim (settlement of litigation) as an heir was taxable as income. Because of a conflict with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Magruder v. Segebade, certiorari was granted..  Opinion of the Court  Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Hughes held that whether the petitioner would receive any property in his capacity as heir depended upon the validity of his ancestor's will and the extent to which it would dispose of his ancestor's estate. When, by compromise and the decree enforcing it, that disposition was limited, what he got from the estate came to him because he was heir, the compromise serving to remove pro tanto the impediment to his inheritance. As such, the exemption applies.

On 19 February 1766, he was promoted again, to General-major, and on 19 January 1771, he was promoted to Feldmarschall-Leutnant, effective 25 February 1767. On 28 March 1785, he was promoted to General der Kavallerie, and on 15 May 1796, to Field Marshal. He was Captain of the Trabanten Life Guard and the Hofburg Watch, both honorary positions from April 1785 until May 1796. He was also president of the Aulic Council, the Imperial cabinet advising the Holy Roman Emperor on military matters. He held this position from May 1796 until his death later that year. He was also a Privy Councilor and an Imperial and Royal Chamberlain. In 1790, he received the Order of the Golden Fleece.Digby Smith. \\"Friedrich Moritz, Graf von Nostitz-Rieneck\\".

Hungargunn Bear It'n Mind (born 22 December 2002 ‚Äì 10 December 2012), also known as Yogi, was a male Hungarian Vizsla who was the Best in Show at Crufts in 2010. He was the record holder for Best in Show victories at all breed championship shows in the UK, having gained 18 of these awards, breaking the record in 2010 which had previously stood for eighty years; this was subsequently beaten in September 2014. Early life Yogi, who went by the show name of Hungargunn Bear It'n Mind, was bred by Mrs Naomi Cragg of Sydney, Australia. His sire was Australia Grand Champion Hubertus Dealers Choice, and dam was Aust. Ch Hungargunn Unforgettable. He was first brought to the UK from Australia in 2004. Show histories=Crufts Yogi was entered in Crufts in 2009 in the Open Dog category of his breed. He won the class and took both the Best of Breed title and Gun dog group titles. A Sealyham Terrier named Ch. Efbe's Hidalgo At Goodspice went on to win Best in Show with a Standard Poodle taking the reserve prize. The other finalists were a Pharaoh Hound, an Old English Sheepdog, a Boxer and a Papillon. In 2010 nearly 22,000 dogs across 187 breeds were entered in the competition. Yogi won the Gun dog group although the judging was delayed by a streaker. Later the same day he was crowned best in show, becoming the first Hungarian Vizsla to do so. The Scottish Terrier CH Rus/Slo/Eur Filisite Brash Celebration, aka Rico, from Russia took second prize and other competitors in the best in show class included a Rottweiler, a Welsh Corgi, and the same Pharaoh Hound from the previous year. Other showsAustralia= Yogi placed second in the Intermediate Dog class of the Hungarian Vizsla Club of New South Wales' Easter Championship Show held on 27 March 2005 with Ch. Iceana Gold Point placing first in the group. Yogi was described by judge Mrs Jackie Perkins of Gardenway Vizslas in the UK as \\"Another lovely dog with lots to like about him. Beautiful head and expression, well proportioned with good front and rear, stood over ground well. Hard decision but handler tended to over-extend him and I just preferred the overall picture of the winner.\\" =United Kingdom= Amber, daughter of Hungargunn Bear It'n Mind. In 2007 he took best in show at the Darlington Dog Show Society's Championship Show held near Ripon, North Yorkshire. Following his successes in 2007 he was one of 25 Champion finalists to be invited to the 29th Pedigree Petfoods Stakes Final, held in February 2008 at the Birmingham NEC in England. He placed third overall, with first going to Ch/Am Ch. Afterglow The Big Tease, a Standard Poodle and second place went to Ch Lux Dutch Ch. Waterley Dressed to Impress, a Tibetan Terrier. Other shows in 2008 he placed in included in a final place in Boston, a best in show at Manchester and Richmond, and reserve at the Southern Counties show, also at South Wales, Leeds, Belfast and at Windsor, Berkshire. In 2008 he placed second at the Welsh Kennel Club Championship. Following a ruling by the Kennel Club on 18 March 2010 his handler for the event, Moray Armstrong, was deemed to have threatened the breed judge. The committee disqualified Mr Armstrong from attending, taking part in, or judging any Kennel Club events for a year in addition to a fine of ¬£500 and costs of ¬£1,210. At the National Dog Show held 7-10 May 2009 he took reserve with Ch. Fairweather's Knock Out with Brooklynbear, a Newfoundland taking best in show. Following his victory at the Manchester show in 2010, he broke the record for most best in show victories at all breed championship shows. The record had previously stood for eighty years since the 1930s when previous Crufts winner Scottish Terrier Ch. Heather Necessity held the record at 16 victories. A Wire Fox Terrier, Ch Travella Striking Steel, (whose pet name is Oliver), became the new record holder after securing his nineteenth best in show award at Driffield championship show in September 2014. His show record in the UK has resulted in him being Top Dog all breeds UK in the Dog World (newspaper) / Pedigree Petfoods competition in 2006, 2007 and fourth in 2008. In 2009 he placed seventh. He was Top Stud Dog all breeds in the Dog World (newspaper) / Royal Canin competitions in 2009 and 2010. Yogi died in his sleep on 10 December 2012, two weeks short of his tenth birthday. Stud service Yogi commanded fees of up to ¬£750 a litter and brought in almost ¬£60,000 from 79 litters. In the five years since he moved to England he fathered 525 puppies, which was more than 10% of all Vizsla puppies registered in the same period. This heavy use of a stud dog (see popular sire effect) has raised concern by some about potential health issues caused by a narrowing gene pool.

The young-adult novel is about the life of a slave girl who was snatched from her homeland in Africa in the early 19th century and brought to the United States, where she eventually escaped from a plantation and fled to freedom. Carter, who started attending Harvard University as a freshman in the fall of 2009, is one of the youngest writers signed by Simon & Schuster. Noni is currently completing a PhD at Columbia University. Literary biography Carter decided to write a novel after sitting around a kitchen table at age 12 with her family listening to a great-aunt tell the story of Rose Caldwell, Carter‚Äôs 4xgreat-grandmother. She especially recalls a description of how her Grandma Rose as a young girl watched as her mother was sold across the Mississippi River. She spent many hours from ages 12 to 15 writing and researching black history for her novel. What began as a short story became the 479-page Good Fortune. She was editing her book by the 11th grade. A writing mentor suggested that Carter start speaking at book festivals. The idea paid off, and her book was picked up by Simon & Schuster at BookExpo America in 2008. Good Fortune The protagonist of Good Fortune is Ayanna Bahati, who is captured in Africa at the age of 4 and brought to the American South as a slave. Ayanna eventually escapes slavery and starts a new life in Ohio. Along the way, she learns to read and write and starts a school for black students. Often sad, she hears her past echoing in her name, Bahati, which means ‚Äúgood fortune.‚Äù Criticism and praise The effect of Carter's book on the current generation has been compared to that of the classic Alex Haley (1921‚Äì1992) novel Roots on previous generations.

The Oda was a practical replacement of the 1982 Izh 2125 Kombi and the last of Izhevsk-designed vehicles. A pick-up truck/panel van variant, known as Izh 2717, was also produced from 1991 to 2005. The first prototype appeared in 1979 but the production was delayed. Early prototypes, conceived in the late 1980s, implemented the base of Moskvitch Aleko, with notable borrowings in the body style, while the powertrain featured an upgraded 2125 Kombi engine and transmission. As planned, Izh Oda entered production in late 1991 alongside the Kombi. Like the Kombi, it was also planned for export release, which never occurred.Russian auto-review \\"Za Rulyom\\" # 9 as of 1995, p.20: New family from Izhevsk. (in Russian) As the USSR collapsed, AZLK (which was more or less IZH's parent factory at the time) started losing revenue before being privatized, and IZH had to convert the production of about half its lines to other industries (such as firearms) in order to keep its automotive market running. As a result, only a faint number of about 5,000 Izh 2126 models were released between 1992 and 1995. Starting 1996, IZH dropped the Moskvitch brand and merged with AutoVAZ, creating the \\"IzhAuto\\" company. The merger allowed to further upgrade the Oda with VAZ-derived features, such as Lada 110's interior design and front-wheel drive, all while implementing Samara's 2106 engine.Autoreview #17/2001. A test comparing IZH-2126 to VAZ-21047 and VAZ-21093 (in Russian) The result was a boost in consumer demand, and in 1997, all of the previous Moskvitch-based models were discontinued, while the main line switched to production of both the 2126 and the 2717 only. The best selling years of this model came between approximately 1998 and 2002, when foreign market wasn't made affordable to the average Russian consumer yet, and the economy car class hatchback brands (such as Lada Sputnik) did not offer much for basically the same price. The Oda also briefly sold in Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus around 2003, which was a promising future for both IzhAuto's models. IZH-21261 However, in early 2005, Russian government overtook country's part in the European emission standards, for which other Russian car manufacturers redesigned their vehicles. IzhAuto, however, did not have enough funds to participate in the program, which obliged the company to discontinue all of its models, and couldn't upgrade its cars to meet new Russian gas emission standard's qualification. The last Oda models ran off the assembly line in September 2005. Starting in 2008, parts of former Izh 2126/2717 production lines have been readapted for Lada Priora hatchback production. In 2014, most of the production plant has undergone major reconstruction to also accept the assembly of the hatchback variant of Lada Granta, as well as upcoming Lada XRAY and Lada Vesta starting 2016. In 2001 the aging car, with its design dating back to 1979, was awarded zero stars out of a possible four by the Russian ARCAP safety assessment program.

Petrolsoft Corporation was founded at Stanford University in 1989 by Bill Miller and David Gamboa as Petrolsoft Software Group. It was later incorporated in 1992. Petrolsoft introduced demand-driven inventory management to the petroleum industry. History The initial idea for Petrolsoft's inventory management product came from founder David Gamboa family's cash flow problems at their chain of retail gasoline stations. Mr. Miller's analysis showed that it was being caused by an inventory imbalance of gasoline stocks. When they approached Chevron with their solution, they discovered this was more than just a family problem, rather an industry-wide problem. The software solution to this problem became Petrolsoft's initial product, based on inventory proportionality. Gordon Hartogensis, a Stanford computer science graduate, joined the company in 1993 as the third partner to lead product development. Petrolsoft's products grew to include sales forecasting, inventory management, demand aggregation, remote inventory and sales reporting, and transportation optimization for the downstream petroleum supply chain and other bulk liquid supply chains. Technology Tank trucks in the oil industry are typically divided internally into 3 to 6 compartments of various sizes. Service stations typically sell three or four different grades of motor fuel. Each delivered grade of motor fuel must have a dedicated underground storage tank. For example, a four compartment truck bringing up to four different products can be filled in 256 (44) different ways. Petrolsoft‚Äôs technology would choose the optimal way to restore inventory proportionality to the station based on its forecasts of sales by product grade. The technology would accurately forecast hourly demand for each grade of motor fuel at each service station, enabling it to determine when the first product would run out, the amounts of other products that would be left at that time, and when the optimal load chosen would fit in the underground storage tanks. The period of time from the forecasted time of fitting in the tanks to the point of product run out was called the ‚Äúdelivery window‚Äù. The delivery window represented the delivery flexibility of when the load could arrive at the service station so that it would fit in the tanks, and arrive prior to first product run out. Based on all of the delivery windows for all of the forecasted deliveries for all of the stations in an oil company‚Äôs directly supplied service station network, Petrolsoft‚Äôs technology would optimize the distribution of motor fuel by scheduling fleets of tank trucks to meet the demand across the distribution network. This optimal automation of the replenishment process led to lower average inventories, better utilization of tank truck fleets, lower overall distribution costs, and reduced manpower requirements. This type of time-based demand-balanced replenishment (just-in-time) was extended up the supply chain from the filling stations to the bulk terminals, where finished product was stored and then to the refinery where the product was made from crude oil feedstocks. Influence Initial customers for the product included Sunoco, ARCO, Mobil, Exxon,Logistics Management - Doing Business and Tosco, expanding to many of the major oil companies in the United States, and eventually world- wide at companies such as YPF (Argentina) and Ampol (Australia). Petrolsoft grew quickly, eventually making the Inc. 500 list of America's fastest growing private companies in both 1998 and 1999. By this time, Petrolsoft had about 50 specialized employees working in three global offices: San Diego, LondonPetrolsoft Will Open London Office April 15 to Serve Petroleum Industry in U.K., Continent, Middle East and Singapore and had released multi-lingual versions of their software for use worldwide. In September 2000, following an extended sales effort, on-site pilot program and the acquisition of Petrolsoft by Aspen Technology, Chevron became one of the largest US customers. The Chevron contract was executed on September 30, 2000 and announced on November 16, 2000. In May 2001, Petro-Canada became the largest Canadian customer, utilizing the software to manage the majority of their company-owned sites located in Ontario and Quebec. In 2003, Petro-Canada extended the solution nationwide. Irving Oil became the next largest Canadian customer, also executing a contract in 2001. Savings for these companies as a result of using Petrolsoft's solutions was in the millions of dollars each year. Prior to the implementation of Petrolsoft's technology, the petroleum industry functioned as a \\"push\\" manufacturing system. That is, product was manufactured based on current market prices without regard to actual branded demand. Once Petrolsoft's demand forecasting based inventory management system was implemented, oil companies were able to track and aggregate demand from their end customers on a real time basis. This allowed them to optimize transportation resources such as tank trucks and pipelines, and to inform how much of their daily demand was constant branded demand versus spot price- driven demand. This real-time information flow changed the way the downstream petroleum industry operated and increased profitability across all adopters. Additionally, the technology prevented service stations from running out of gasoline, lowered inventory carrying costs, and lowered the cost per gallon delivered to the customer. Acquisition On June 1, 2000, Petrolsoft Corporation was acquired by Aspen Technology, Inc. (AZPN), a public software company focused on the process manufacturing software space in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $60 million at the time of acquisition. Over a several month period, Petrolsoft's Supply Retail software suite was integrated with Aspen Technology's PIMS crude selection and refinery operations planning and execution software. Petrolsoft's suite of supply chain management tools completed Aspen's fully integrated petroleum offering from the sourcing of crude oil, through the manufacturing process, and down to the end customer putting gasoline into their vehicle.

It was initially released by Re-Flyte Records in December 1987 and was subsequently reissued on CD in 1989, with an additional seven bonus tracks. Never Before consists of material recorded between 1965 and 1967 by the original line-up of the Byrds, featuring Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark, David Crosby, Chris Hillman, and Michael Clarke (although Gene Clark had left the group by early 1966). The songs on the album were all originally recorded for Columbia Records during the sessions for the band's first five studio albums: Mr. Tambourine Man, Turn! Turn! Turn!, Fifth Dimension, Younger Than Yesterday, and The Notorious Byrd Brothers. The album represented the first time that previously unreleased outtakes from the Byrds' tenure with Columbia Records had been officially released. Conception and production The album's genesis can be traced back to the early 1980s, when folk singer Tom Slocum ‚Äì a friend of former Byrd Gene Clark ‚Äì stumbled across a cache of forgotten Byrds' recordings in the tape library at Wally Heider Studios in Los Angeles. According to Slocum, these tapes included early versions of \\"Eight Miles High\\" and \\"Why\\" that had been recorded at RCA Studios in late 1965, along with the outtakes \\"Triad\\" and \\"The Day Walk (Never Before)\\". Slocum immediately notified the Byrds' former manager, Jim Dickson, of his discovery and before long, Dickson had involved Bob Hyde of Murray Hill Records, with an eye to producing an archival compilation album. Although the Byrds had disbanded in 1973, Hyde felt sure that there was a market for a collection like Never Before, due to the renewed interest in the band that had been generated by their influence on the likes of R.E.M., the Smiths, and the Bangles during the 1980s. Hyde retained Dickson's help in the project as a way of ensuring that the album would have the blessing of the ex-members of the Byrds and, in some cases, their active participation in enhancing the material. Following the initial discovery at Wally Heider Studios, a thorough search of the Columbia Records' tape vaults ensued and additional unreleased material dating from the mid-1960s was unearthed. Dickson and Hyde then set about compiling a ten track running order comprising the best of the available tapes. Dickson also elected to remix the chosen songs with the help of Lawrence Wendelken, in an attempt to improve the fidelity of the recordings. Two of Crosby's compositions on the album benefitted from the addition of newly recorded overdubs, performed by ex-members of the Byrds, in an attempt to further polish the material. \\"It Happens Each Day\\", an outtake from the Younger Than Yesterday sessions, had been abandoned in an incomplete state during the 1960s and, as a result, it required further instrumental embellishment to prepare it for release. The new enhancements to \\"It Happens Each Day\\" included an acoustic guitar solo, played by the band's bassist, Chris Hillman. Crosby's controversial ode to a potential m√©nage √† trois, \\"Triad\\", also required additional work, after a problem with the lead vocal track was discovered. The problem was solved by having Crosby re-sing one line, although according to Dickson, the substitution was so precise that it is virtually undetectable. Music Among the wealth of previously unreleased material included on the album, two songs came from the pen of Gene Clark. Of these, \\"She Has a Way\\" was an outtake from the Mr. Tambourine Man sessions that had previously appeared in demo form on the Preflyte album, while \\"Never Before\\" was a Dylanesque song that had been discarded during the recording of the band's second album. The title of this latter song was coined by Clark in 1987, due to his inability to recall its original title. Ultimately, the song provided the album with its name, but in the years following the release of Never Before, studio documentation was discovered that revealed that the song's original title had, in fact, been \\"The Day Walk\\". As a result, all subsequent appearances of the song on Byrds' compilation albums have borne the title \\"The Day Walk (Never Before)\\". Early versions of \\"Eight Miles High\\" and \\"Why\\" also made their debut on the album. These two tracks had both been recorded at RCA Studios in Los Angeles on December 22, 1965, for release as part of the Byrds' third album. However, the band ran into trouble with Columbia Records, who refused to release the recordings, due to them having been produced at another company's studios. As a result, the band were forced to re-record both songs at Columbia Studios in Los Angeles on January 24 and 25, 1966, and it was these re-recorded versions that were released as a single and, in the case of \\"Eight Miles High\\", included on the Fifth Dimension album. In later years, both McGuinn and Crosby expressed a preference towards the original RCA version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" over the more famous Columbia recording, with both band members feeling that it was more spontaneous sounding. The album also included what critic Richie Unterberger has called \\"a rough but endearing\\" cover of Bob Dylan's \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\", which had initially been recorded as a potential third single for the band, during sessions for the Turn! Turn! Turn! album. As well as featuring previously unreleased material, Never Before also included some of the band's more familiar songs presented in newly prepared stereo mixes. The band's debut single, \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", and its B-side, \\"I Knew I'd Want You\\", both received a new stereo remix, as did Crosby's song, \\"Lady Friend\\". However, this latter track also received newly overdubbed drums. \\"Lady Friend\\" had only ever been released in mono and both Hyde and Dickson wanted to take the opportunity to issue the song in stereo for the first time on Never Before. However, Michael Clarke's drumming on the track was not deemed strong enough to stand being exposed by the new stereo mix and so, an unnamed session drummer was brought in to give the track a more powerful drum sound. This newly overdubbed drum part proved to be controversial among fans of the band, however, with many feeling that the addition of modern sounding drums (by 1980's standards) was completely inappropriate and incongruous to the mid-60s recording. As a result, this doctored version of \\"Lady Friend\\" has not been included on any subsequent release by the Byrds and remains unique to Never Before. Release Never Before was released on December 1, 1987 by Re-Flyte Records (a specially created imprint of Murray Hill) as a vinyl LP and a cassette tape. Upon release it was generally well received, garnering far more attention in the music press than contemporary solo releases by the individual ex-members of the Byrds. The album was later reissued on CD by Murray Hill on May 1, 1989, with the addition of seven bonus tracks dating from the same 1965‚Äì1967 period. Like the original album, the bonus tracks were all newly remixed, but this time the remixing was undertaken by Ken Robertson and the band's lead guitarist Roger McGuinn, rather than Dickson and Wendelken. Included among the bonus tracks were the previously unreleased outtakes \\"I Know My Rider (I Know You Rider)\\", \\"Psychodrama City\\", \\"Flight 713\\", and \\"Moog Raga\\". In addition, new stereo remixes of the B-sides \\"Why\\", \\"She Don't Care About Time\\", and \\"Don't Make Waves\\" were included. Two Chris Hillman penned songs were dropped from the track listing of the expanded CD reissue just prior to its release. The first of these was a new stereo remix of \\"Have You Seen Her Face\\", which eventually appeared on The Byrds box set in 1990, and the second was a version of \\"Old John Robertson\\" featuring newly recorded mandolin overdubs. As of 20, this augmented version of \\"Old John Robertson\\" remains unreleased. In the years since it was issued, many of the tracks that first appeared on Never Before have been included on subsequent Byrds' releases, most notably on the expanded Columbia/Legacy album reissues and the box sets The Byrds and There Is a Season. Two tracks that have not appeared on any other release, however, are the stereo remix of \\"Lady Friend\\", featuring newly recorded drumming, and The Notorious Byrd Brothers outtake, \\"Flight 713\\". Never Before is currently out of print, but remains sought after by Byrds collectors due to the presence of these two tracks.

When physical education fails to meet its goals of providing students with the knowledge base, life habits, and mindset necessary to be physically active throughout their lifetime, it can lead children to adopt a sedentary lifestyle. According to a 2010 study by the WHO, 81% of children aged 11‚Äì17 worldwide did not meet the minimum recommended exercise guidelines of 60 minutes daily. A physical education class for secondary students in Havana, Cuba. Although more prevalent in countries of high income, physical inactivity is an international issue that is correlated with an obesity epidemic and negative physical, psychological, and academic consequences in children. A high quality physical education programs consists of these attributes: * Physical education teachers are certified * Students in elementary school have physical education class for a minimum of 150 minutes per week, while students in high school have it for at least 225 minutes per week * Concrete and achievable standards for students to meet (often for high school graduation) Elementary students playing with a parachute in their physical education class in Leland, North Carolina, USA. Causes The causes of lack of physical education vary from country to country. These include a shortage in facilities and equipment, a paucity of physical education teachers, large class sizes, and budgetary constraints. In some African countries such as Botswana and Malawi, where children attend school for a minimal amount of time, the budgets allocated for physical education are instead used to concentrate on subjects such as languages and mathematics. A lack of physical education also arises from cultural views: in parts of Central America (such as the Bahamas) and Asia (such as Pakistan), exercise is seen as a form of leisure that should not be featured in an academic curriculum. Another example exists in India, where girls are often discouraged from engaging in sports because such activity is viewed as \\"unfeminine\\", as is the possibility of them becoming too muscular. Moreover, a lack of governmental legislation and intervention can be to blame. In parts of South America (with the exception of Chile and Colombia), there are no laws that make physical education compulsory: thus, it is omitted from many schools. In other cases, such as in areas of the United States, the mandated physical education hours are simply not met. For example, in 33 states, students are permitted to be exempt from physical education courses by replacing them with other activities such as marching band practices. Outside of school, children often fail to engage in physical activity due to lack of physical literacy, inadequate sleep, the increasing attractiveness of rival pastimes such as video games, and parents that do not play their part. It is important that parents allow their children the full opportunity to participate in both formal and informal sports and promote healthy physical activity levels. Also, in achievement-oriented populations such as those seen in China, there is an increased emphasis on academic results which also detracts from physical activity time. The deterioration of physical education in schools combined with the elimination of playgrounds and other play facilities forces children to stay inactive and inside for most of the school day which can have serious long-term consequences.  Consequences  Physical consequences of obesity An increase in sedentary lifestyle due to a lack of physical education at home and at school has many physical and psychological consequences on a child in the short and long term.  Physical  According to a Portuguese study, children with sedentary lifestyles have nine times poorer motor coordination than active children of the same age. They also have worsened bone density, strength, and flexibility. In the long term, they are more likely to use tobacco, alcohol, and drugs than their active peers. Sedentary behaviour is strongly associated with obesity, and this imparts a great health risk. Obese children are more likely to have high blood pressure, heart disease, high LDL cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, menstrual cycle abnormalities, bone and joint problems, increased cancer risk, and reduced balance. They are also more likely to be obese adults. Childhood physical inactivity has been correlated to cholesterol and fatty streaks in the aorta in the first decade of life and moves to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body in the second and third decade of life, causing health issues. A lack of physical activity is one of the main causes for obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other physical health issues among children and adolescents. There is a direct correlation between active participation in physical activity and the health of school age children, therefore a lack of physical education would cause a lack in physical activity in children, leading to worse health.  Psychological  As exercise is known to improve well-being and reduce stress, physical inactivity is correlated with poor psychological health such as an increase of major depression. There is a link between obesity and psychiatric illness and the two feed on each other in a vicious cycle. A lack of physical activity is associated with poorer concentration and academic performance, particularly in mathematics and reading. Obesity induced from lack of exercise also contributes to a decrease in general mental health. Overweight children and teens are more likely to suffer from poor self-esteem, negative body image, teasing, and bullying. Higher levels of sedentary and lower levels of physical education are linked to worse mental health and lower cognitive function among children.  In Canada = Current trends  The majority of Canadian children aged 5 to 17 years old (91%) do not meet the daily physical activity recommendations. Although Canadian physical education programs are improving significantly, with 61-80% of schools offering a minimum of 150 minutes of physical education classes per week in 2016, and participation levels in organized sport are on the rise, Canadian school programs are ineffective in encouraging healthy habits. In fact, most Canadian children (56%) lack physical literacy. Consequently, they face many issues related to lifestyle. These include sedentary behaviours such as increased screen time averaging 176 minutes a day from TVs and video games to the detriment of active play. There is also the inevitable decrease in active transportation, more sleep deprivation, and a poor quality of diet. These lifestyle trends have caused youth obesity rates to nearly triple over the past 30 years. In 2013, this consisted of 28% of Canadian children ages 5‚Äì19 that were classified as overweight or obese.  Addressing the Lack of Physical Education  Recommendations and Regulations = The Canadian Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (CAHPERD) has recommended that Canadian schools and school boards take action through specific academic initiatives to ensuring that their physical education curriculum is effective at encouraging and instilling healthy exercise habits in young Canadians. CAHPERD has suggested that schools focus on checking the quality (adequate facilities, budget and research-verified techniques) and quantity (minimum 30 minutes a day) of a school's physical education courses as well as the professional qualifications of the educators. The consultants should check that classes meet the needs of all students irrespective of race, sex, gender, and ability level. The courses should also encourage participation and skill development, with a healthy balance of competitive and noncompetitive activities. Moreover, it is of utmost importance that physical activity and physical education be encouraged by the teacher: they should never be used to punish a student (such as what is seen through the common practice of making children run if they misbehave). Outside of class hours, CAHPERD recommends that schools provide opportunities for intramural activities and involve parents in the fitness initiative. The Pan-Canadian Public Health Network first decided to prioritize the issue of childhood obesity in September 2010 by creating the framework Curbing Childhood Obesity: An overview of the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Framework for Action to Promote Healthy Weights. In this project, federal, provincial and territorial Ministers of Health agreed to focus on three goals: increasing the predominance of nutritious food choices, addressing obesity at an early age, and creating better spaces for children that favour physical activity and healthy eating. This has allowed the action plan Towards a Healthier Canada to be created. The Canadian Physical Activity guidelines for children ages 5 to 17 consist of at least 1 hour of daily physical activity. Their exercise should range in intensity from moderate (inducing light perspiration and harder breathing) to vigorous (inducing heavy perspiration and heavy breathing). Examples of moderate exercise include bike riding and playground activities, and examples of vigorous exercise include running and swimming. It is recommended that they engage in both vigorous activities and activities strengthening bone and muscles at least three times a week. The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology also recommends that children ages 5 to 17 limit their sedentary activities, such as television and video games, sedentary transport, and extensive sitting. It is advised that children limit their recreational screen time to a maximum of 120 minutes a day. The Childhood Obesity Foundation, a Canadian initiative, has invented the 5-2-1-0 mnemonic to remember the national lifestyle recommendations. This consists of 5 servings or more of vegetables and fruit per day, no more than 2 hours of screen time a day, 1 hour of physical activity or more per day, and 0 sugary drinks. Since the inception of Towards a Healthier Canada, many initiatives have been launched to meet the three goals, and they vary from province to province. They are projects made in the name of a framework or jurisdictional approach/governmental department that are either targeted at schools, at a community, or in partnership with other organizations or companies.  In the United States = Current Trends  Nearly 10 million children and adolescents in the United States ages 6‚Äì19 are considered overweight because the lack of physical education in schools. Children aged 6‚Äì11 have also more than doubled in rate of obesity over the last twenty years. Individual states have set requirements for physical education in their schools, but how physical education is conducted across the country has not been established. Yet, physical education has been a common practice of the K-12 education curriculum in the United States. The No Child Left Behind Act has created an environment in which physical education, art and music have been left behind, viewed as \\"nonessential\\" courses. Federal funding is more dependent on schools enhancing their math and reading programs.  Addressing the Lack of Physical Education  Regulations and Recommendations = One program the United States has adopted to decrease obesity are before-school exercise programs with elementary aged children. One in particular consists of reaching 100 miles before the end of the school year. Each milestone of 25 miles the child will earn a check mark on a tee-shirt. They will then be rewarded at 100 miles with a trophy and an announcement over the school loudspeaker. Walking is supervised by teachers and done around school grounds or inside the school. This is a great way for a child to improve health, concentration, confidence and happiness. Throughout the past two decades, federal support for physical education in the public health sector has increased dramatically. Since 1992, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has funded state education agencies to get them to partner with state health departments to promote physical activity and healthy eating in schools among young people. In February 2010, first lady Michelle Obama started the \\"Let's Move\\" initiative to address the childhood obesity epidemic. Efforts to engage in schools to fight against childhood obesity were taken within 1 year of establishing the program. Budget cuts in the United States have led to less funding and support for physical education because it is not a \\"core\\" subject.  In China = Current Trends  Even though obesity has increased among most of the population in China, the burden of obesity has shifted onto the lower educated population, likely due to a lack of physical education or health education. Students in China are beginning to gain equal opportunities to physical education and sports to further improve their physical health and strength. Sport and physical education in China is extremely influenced by Confucianism which emphasizes collectivism. The values it holds emphasizes self-sacrifice and subordination of one's interests to those of others.  Addressing the Lack of Physical Education  Regulations and Recommendations = In 2011, The Chinese Ministry of Education has developed standards for physical education in schools. These emphasize enhancing children's health development is the primary goal of physical education in schools. These standards include: * \\"Standard 1: Physical activity participation‚ÄîStudents participate in physical activities and are able to enjoy exercise and experience success.\\" * \\"Standard 2: Mastery of knowledge, skill, and safe exercise methods‚ÄîStudents learn knowledge about exercise, perform physical skills, understand safe exercise principles, and learn self-defense.\\" * \\"Standard 3: Developing physical health‚ÄîStudents learn and master knowledge and method of maintaining health, develop and sustain healthy posture and bodily shape, develop and maintain physical fitness, and improve adaptive ability in natural environments.\\" * \\"Standard 4: Developing mental health‚ÄîStudents learn to develop mental strength, control emotions, develop ability to collaborate and cooperate, and follow ethical norms of physical activity.\\" The General Administration of Sport in China has been one of the leading government agencies that promotes the development of physical education and physical health in the elementary and college levels. The government has for the most part supported physical education and sport in school, but has often abused it as a political tool which leads to ignoring its importance and the needs of individual students.  In European (EU) Countries = Current Trends  In the EU, physical education is a mandatory subject in general education. The time dedicated to physical education varies greatly from country to country. About half of EU countries devote 10% of their school curriculum to physical education. Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia devote 15%, while Ireland only 4%. Out of all EU countries, France devotes the most time to physical education in elementary school, a total of 108 hours, which is only 10% of the total teaching time. The primary education designers in European countries view physical education as less important than other subjects. Physical inactivity is responsible for over 500,000 deaths per year in the European Union and accounts for economic costs of over ‚Ç¨80 billion per year. Funding for physical education in EU schools is poor, which has led to poor quality physical education. This lack of funding is reflected in poor quality and lack of equipment at EU schools in respectively 26% and 38% of EU countries.  Addressing the Lack of Physical Education  Regulations and Recommendations = In 2007, the European Parliament's Resolution on the Role of Sport in Education helped parliament conclude that physical education is ‚Äúthe only school subject which seeks to prepare children for a healthy lifestyle and focuses on their overall physical and mental development, as well as imparting important social values such as fairness, self-discipline, solidarity, team spirit, tolerance and fair play‚Ä¶‚Äù and one of the most important tools for social integration. European Parliament's Resolution places physical education on the European political agenda, highlighting its importance. The European Physical Education Association recommends daily physical education in elementary grades up to 11 or 12 years of age and 3 hours per week in post-elementary and high school grades.

He hit a 300' plus home run at age 12 at Victory Lane Sports Park in Glendale, Arizona.http://www.playvictorylane.com/facilities.html Amateur career Matt Hobgood attended Norco High School in Norco, California. Nicknamed Arizona by a freshman football coach after just having moved from the state, he was a three-sport athlete (baseball, football and basketball), and a four-year varsity baseball player. He led his team to back-to-back playoff appearances in the CIF Southern Section Division I baseball playoffs against Long Beach Poly in 2008 and Santa Ana Mater Dei in 2009. As a 6'4\\" 230 lb. \\"country strong\\" freshman, Hobgood played center and power forward in basketball, and was heavily recruited by the football coaches who saw him earning a future college scholarship as an offensive lineman. The heavy weightlifting workouts required of linemen were not conducive to pitching, and Hobgood opted to only play one year before giving up football to remain a pitcher. Hobgood was a high school baseball teammate of current Minor League Baseball pitcher Brandon Cunniff, and catcher Jake Romanski currently with the Boston Red Sox affiliate. He was also a baseball and football teammate of former Stanford University running back and former Jacksonville Jaguars tailback, Toby Gerhart. Despite missing nearly his entire freshman baseball season after fracturing his ankle in basketball, he set 14 season and career records at Norco, which still stand to date, including Victories, Won-Loss Percentage, Games Pitched, Innings Pitched, Shut-outs, Runs Scored, Homeruns, RBIs, and Slugging Average. He also broke the Riverside County single season high school home run record hitting 21 home runs his senior year. As a junior, Hobgood had a perfect 11-0 season, capped off by a pitching performance some professional scouts in Southern California deemed \\"the best high school pitching duel\\" they had seen, and which solidified Hobgood's name as a top high school pitching prospect. Hobgood beat former Orange Lutheran High School senior and current New York Yankees pitcher, Gerrit Cole in a CIF Semi-Final playoff game in which Cole was recorded by multiple sources hitting 99-101 mph and Hobgood 95-97 mph on the radar. The Norco Cougars won 1-0 on a run-scoring single against Cole. As a senior, Hobgood had an 11-1 record, 0.92 ERA with 101 strikeouts and just 26 walks in 68.1 innings. Along with a 95 mph fastball was a quick bat and powerful swing that produced a national-best 21 home runs to go along with a .475 average and 55 RBI. Hobgood was named the 2009 Gatorade National Baseball Player of the Year after being chosen as the California State Gatorade Baseball Player of the Year following a junior and senior season in which he amassed a 21-1 record on the mound and hit 40 home runs. The only loss during the two-year period came in the 2009 CIF Southern Section Division I playoff game against former Mater Dei standout, Cory Hahn) Professional career Going into the 2009 draft, many professional scouts were excited about Hobgood with several teams expressing interest in him in the first round. He was the first round pick by the Baltimore Orioles and the 5th overall selection in the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed his first professional contract on Saturday, June 27, 2009, and began his career with the Bluefield Orioles of the Appalachian League the following day. In 2009, he had a 1-2 record with a 4.72 ERA in eight games started. He played for the Single-A Delmarva Shorebirds during the 2010 season. He missed the 2012 season due to surgery to repair a loose shoulder capsule, which was performed by noted shoulder specialist, Dr. Craig Morgan, of the Morgan-Kalman Clinic in Wilmington, Delaware. In 2013, he became a relief pitcher. He began the 2015 season with the Bowie Baysox of the Class AA Eastern League, but his season ended after six games when he required arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder to remove a bone spur. Hobgood elected for Free Agency in November 2015, ending his time in the Orioles system. In 2016, Hobgood signed to play with the Joliet Slammers, a member of the Independent Frontier League, but was placed on the suspended list in April 2016 and never appeared in a game for the team.https://www.frontierleague.com/transactions-2/ In November 2016, Hobgood announced he would be switching to a batting player in an attempt to make it back into affiliated baseball.http://www.masnsports.com/school-of-roch/2016/11/hobgood-taking-a- shot-at-hitting.html As of the start of 2017 spring training, he has not been signed to a professional contract. Personal life Hobgood was six years old when his father, Rick, was diagnosed with colon cancer. He subsequently died in 2005, when Hobgood was 14 years old.

His compositional output consists of works for cello, piano, choir and orchestra (most notably An Ancient Song and A Summer Idyll) and a considerable amount of chamber music (most notably String Quartet in D, Sonata in E Minor and A Horse Race Ballad). Early life in the UK Smith was born in Birmingham. A child prodigy, he began studying cello at a very young age with W.H. Priestley in Birmingham and then later with Carl Fuchs in Manchester. His first professional cello recital was given at the Birmingham Town Hall in 1890 when he was just 8 years old as part of the Harrison Concert series. Since then he performed actively in concerts as both a soloist and a chamber musician. Eventually he pursued further training at the Royal Northern College of Music and the University of Manchester (UM) where he was a pupil of Henry Hiles. While at the UM he became a member of the Hall√© Orchestra and eventually played in the orchestra at the Royal Opera House for five years. He notably performed under the batons of B√©la Bart√≥k, Claude Debussy, Frederick Delius, Edward Elgar, and Richter among others. Life in Canada In 1910 Smith emigrated to Canada, and was quickly hired by Frank Welsman to play for his Toronto Symphony Orchestra (no relation to the current orchestra of that name), becoming principal cellist in 1917 for that orchestra's final season. He met his wife, violinist Lena Hayes Smith (188?‚Äì1956), while playing in Welsman's orchestra. He later became a member of the new Toronto Symphony Orchestra when it was founded in 1922, serving as its principal cellist from 1932‚Äì1940. In 1938 he became principal cellist of the Toronto Philharmonic Orchestra (TPO), a position he held until the mid-1940s. Smith was appointed to the faculty of the Toronto Conservatory of Music in 1911 where he was a professor of music composition, music history, music theory, and cello performance through 1941. While there he played with two notable chamber groups in residence at the school, the Conservatory Trio in his early years and later the Conservatory String Quartet from 1929‚Äì1941. He was also a member of two notable string quartets in Toronto, the Toronto String Quartette, with whom he played in 1914, and the Academy String Quartet, with whom he played during the 1920s. From 1927 until his retirement in 1950, Smith taught on the music faculty of the University of Toronto. Among his notable pupils were Marcus Adeney, Louis Applebaum, Gerald Bales, John Beckwith, Keith Bissell, Howard Brown, Glenn Gould, Kenneth Peacock, Margaret Sargent, and Bertha Tamblyn. He died in Toronto, aged 70. Works as a writer As a writer, Smith first displayed his talents as a contributing editor from 19181935 to the magazine Conservatory Quarterly Review . Smith wrote three music textbooks all of which became widely used in North America and went through numerous editions:  From 19501952 he was a music critic for The Globe and Mail newspaper.

It had up to 20,000 armed troops at its peak, and was one of the largest forces opposing the government of Myanmar at its time. It was also involved in drug trafficking in Southeast Asia. The MTA had its headquarters in Ho Mong (Homein), Langkho District, a village near the border of Mae Hong Son Province.; Bertil Lintner, in Asia Online; 1 November 2007 History The Mong Tai Army was founded in 1985, after the merging of two rebel factions; Khun Sa's Shan United Army (SUA) and Moh Heng's \\"Tai Revolutionary Council\\" faction of the Shan United Revolutionary Army (SURA). Despite officially stating that their goal is ultimately independence for Shan State, both groups have been accused of acting as private armies for Shan warlords (Khun Sa and Moh Heng, respectively). They have both also been accused of being heavily involved in the drug trade in the Golden Triangle, an area that produces millions of dollars of opium every year. In the 1990s, the Mong Tai Army had a peak strength of 20,000 soldiers. After heavy battles against the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) between 1993 and 1995, tensions grew between the Shan nationalist field officers and the Chinese leaders. Shan nationalists wanted to achieve an independent state for the Shan minority, while the Chinese leaders were more interested in the illicit opium trade and the money that it earned. Until 1996, the Mong Tai Army was also fighting the United Wa State Army (UWSA), something which benefited Tatmadaw forces in the area. During their fighting, the USWA managed to occupy two large swathes of territory near the Thai border, north and south of the city of Kengtung. On 7 July 1995, an internal dispute broke out within the Mong Tai Army, and 8,000 fighters under the command of Colonel Yod Kan and Dae Wain retreated into the village of Hsipaw, where they built a new base. They renamed themselves the Shan State National Army, and the group intended to negotiate a ceasefire agreement with government forces. Khun Sa claimed that the source of the dispute was that the soldiers who left did not want to fight for a leader with multiple goals. However, the soldiers claimed that the drug profits went only to Khun Sa, and that civilian casualties were the highest in fighting between the Mong Tai Army and government forces because of a lack of leadership. Thousands died as a direct result from fighting between the Mong Tai Army and government forces. A majority of the Mong Tai Army laid down their arms and surrendered to government forces in 1995, but around 3,000 split and formed a new faction of the Shan United Revolutionary Army, which later renamed to the Shan State Army - South (SSA-S). According to the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), the terms of the surrender stipulated that in return for ending his insurgency and surrendering his weaponry, Khun Sa would be allowed to live under close government supervision in Yangon (Rangoon), where he would be allowed to engage indirectly, through third-party investors, in legitimate business operations and he would not be prosecuted for his trafficking activities or be extradited to the US. Khun Sa was not only pardoned by the government, but received the title of \\"honored elder\\", and was allowed to live out the remainder of his life in Yangon, where he died in 2007. Drug trafficking Khun Sa has frequently claimed that the Mong Tai Army was not about the drug trade or making profits from drug trafficking, and claimed that in fact, they were strongly opposed to opium. However, it is reported that Khun Sa once offered to sell his army's entire opium supply to the US government, an offer which was refused. In 1989, Khun Sa was charged by a New York court for trying to import 1,000 tonnes of heroin into the US, with the US DEA offering a $2,000,000 bounty for his arrest.

Mount Brown (1837-1919)Who Was Who in British Philately, Association of British Philatelic Societies, 2010. Retrieved 22 September 2011. was an early British philatelist and the compiler of only the second published stamp catalogue in the English language. Brown attended the City of London School and started to collect stamps in around 1860.The Stamp Lover, Vol.1, No.1, June 1908, pp.5-6.  Catalogues  Mount Brown published his Catalogue of British, Colonial, and Foreign Postage Stamps in May 1862, just weeks after Frederick Booty published his catalogue in April 1862, however, Brown's catalogue was more successful and reckoned to be more complete. Unlike Booty, Brown's catalogue was unillustrated. Others, such as Dr. Viner, may already have prepared unpublished hand-written lists of stamps. Brown's catalogue was more successful than Booty's and went through 7500 copies and five editions up to 1864. Brown largely compiled his catalogue in the Rectory of All Hallows Staining, and he believed that the church there was the one mentioned by Charles Dickens in Dombey & Son. Mount Brown had a collection of about 400 stamps but was able to list 1200 different types in his first catalogue with the help of a group of like-minded collectors who met on Saturday afternoons to pool their knowledge. These included Dr. Charles W. Viner, Henry Haslett, Frederick Philbrick, William Hughes-Hughes, Sir Daniel Cooper and the Rev. Francis J. Stainforth. The Rev. Stainforth in particular was said to have had a very fine collection which largely formed the basis for Brown's catalogue.Birch, Brian. Biographies of Philatelists and Dealers. 9th edition. Standish, Wigan: 2008, p.1362. The catalogue was quickly plagiarised, by John Kline, writing as A.C. Kline, in 1862, and by W.H. Wright writing as \\"A Collector\\" in 1863. According to The Stamp Collectors Magazine, Brown was well aware of the plagiarism and had arranged for all copies of Wright's work to be surrendered to him for destruction. He had also taken steps to prevent the introduction of Kline's work to Great Britain.The Stamp Collector's Magazine, 1 July 1863, pp.93-94. Addenda to the catalogue were published in The Stamp Collector's Magazine, of which Mr Viner was editor 1863-67, and revisions to the format of the catalogue took place in the third edition, following contact between Mount Brown and Dr. Gray of the British Museum.\\"On Postage Stamp Catalogues\\" by Dr.J.E. Gray in The Stamp Collector's Magazine, 1 April 1863, pp.41-43. The number of stamps listed also expanded and details of forgeries began to be included.  Philatelic business  As well as catalogues, a stamp album was available, billed as Mount Brown's Postage-Stamp or Crest Album, price seven and a half shillings, and lists of unused postage stamps.Advertising in The Stamp Collector's Magazine, 1 February 1863, p.15. Download here. By 1870 Brown's philatelic business was so great that he was forced to choose between it and his normal profession. He chose to give up philately but retained an interest, visiting the Junior Philatelic Society's exhibition in 1908 where he met Fred Melville.  Organised philately  The small group who met at All Hallows Staining formed the nucleus of what became The Philatelic Society, London, which eventually became the Royal Philatelic Society London.Rogers-Tillstone, Capt. B. The Royal Philatelic Society London 1869-1969. London: Royal Philatelic Society, 1969, p.13. Mount Brown was not a member of The Philatelic Society, possibly because it was open only to amateurs.

Durland Scout Reservation is a Scout camp owned by the Westchester-Putnam Council in Putnam Valley, New York. It is of mostly deciduous forest containing five lakes, bordered by Clarence Fahnestock State Park to the northeast. It has about forty campsites and nine cabins. In the summer months, it is used as one of three Westchester-Putnam Council cub scout day camps. History In 1968, environmentalist and National Geographic Director of Exploration William O. Field sold his property to the Boy Scouts of America. The camp was originally named Clear Lake Scout Reservation for one of the lakes on the property. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation offered to buy the land from Field to add on to the newly formed and neighboring Clarence Fahnestock State Park, but Field declined, claiming that the BSA would be better caretakers of the land, keeping it \\"forever wild\\". The estate was sold to the council in 1968. In 1993, the council voted to save the then \\"Clear Lake\\" from being sold for $4.5 million to private developers who would build a golf course on the land. The council voted down the proposal. In 2007, the council renamed Clear Lake to the Agatha A. Durland Scout Reservation. The reservation's namesake had donated oceanfront property in Rye, New York on Milton Point, to the council and a 20-year trust to the council. The trust was terminated and the money split throughout the council. In 2007, the waterfront property, Durland Scout Center, was sold to private developers. The name and trust were transferred to Clear Lake. The reservation The camp is accessible by car from Oscawana Lake Road. The reservation is located at 1 Clear Lake in Putnam Valley, New York, ZIP Code 10579. A road that is accessible by common vehicles that is approximately 1 mile long leads to a small dirt parking lot and the Sperling Pavilion, which is used for the summer camp that takes place during the summer. The camp office is located along the road. The reservation encompasses 1,400 acres of deciduous forest and two large lakes, marshes and three smaller ponds. Nine cabins, named Jones, Nardone, Schutt, Oak, White Pine, Maple, Birch, Hemlock and Cedar cabins, are located on the reservation. 40 campsites are available for short-term camping. Most are equipped with latrines. Some have a nearby water supply. There are also 2 lean-to sites. See The camp is maintained year-round by the ranger who lives on the property assisted by campmasters who assist on a weekend basis. The camp ranger as of 2019 is Keith Wiggers.

It was founded in 1892 by Egnate Ninoshvili and M. G. Tskhakaya as a literary-political group, and became affiliated with the international socialist-Marxist movement in 1893. The name, meaning \\"third group,\\" was coined by Irakli Tsereteli during his speech at the funeral for Ninoshvili and it was printed in the newspaper Kvali. Mesame Dasi in the Great Russian Encyclopedia, hosted by Yandex\\"Joseph Stalin: a biographical companion\\" - Google Books\\"The making of the Georgian nation\\" - Google Books History=Early years The Georgian Social Democrats were the ones who took over the name Mesame Dasi (Third Group) in 1893, in order to differentiate themselves from the other two groups, the Pirveli Dasi (First Group) and the Meore Dasi (Second Group). These were two other groups of intellectuals that had been active in the earlier two decades. The Mesame Dasi began their activities by disseminating Marxist propaganda to the workers at various oil refineries and oil fields, along with the railway workers working on the Transcaucasian railway. All of their disseminations were done legally, through various legal channels. They, in doing so, found two men, Afanas'ev and Stanislaw Reniger, also distributing revolutionary works to the workers. With the joining of these two, the Mesame Dasi created reading and study circles in which they taught the workers. They even translated the Russian texts into Georgian for those who could read that. Much like the other propaganda circles that were being done in Russia, the Mesame Dasi put their own spin on their teachings, from Russian history to biology. In order to keep away from legal trouble, the Dasi kept away from discussing the movement and did not attend any of the sporadic strikes among the workers. Stalin's involvement Joseph Stalin joined the Mesame Dasi in 1898 when he was 20, while he was attending the Tiflis Theological Seminary. Through the Mesame Dasi, he was first introduced to the ideas of Karl Marx.\\"Twentieth century Russia\\" - Google Books\\"Marshal Joseph Stalin\\"- Times Online\\"The Life of Josef Stalin\\" - Logoi He was in charge of one of the study circles, but became discontented with the viewpoints of the majority. Because of Stalin's sympathies toward Bolsheviks and the irritating manner in which he presided, he found himself constantly at odds with the others in the group. Stalin began to form an opposition group in response to this composed of Lado Ketskhoveli, Alexander Tsulukidze, and himself, which was firmly in the minority. This group, as stated by Lavrentiy Beria, was the beginning of the Leninist Bolshevik organization that would be created in 1904. In working against the majority, the group was finally able, in 1900, to move the entire organization more into propaganda and acts of mass agitation. But the actions of Stalin and his minority continued to irk the leaders of the Mesame Dasi.\\"Beria: Stalin's First Lieutenant\\" - Google Books\\"In The Russian Empire\\" - Dictionary of Georgian National Biography Finally, in December 1901, they expelled him from the group. However, Stalin's minority group would have a lasting effect on some of the leaders. Mikha Tskhakaya, one of the founders of the Mesame Dasi, would end up becoming Georgia's first Bolshevik and support Vladimir Lenin's ideology, along with defending Stalin in his later activities.\\"Young Stalin\\" - Google Books Strengthening nationalism As time went by, the activists among the group, those who participated in the Dasi's illegal activities, began to want to do more. By 1901, the nationalist movement had spread across Georgia, becoming more violent in nature. The old intellectuals of the Dasi continued to oppose the actions of the activists, but their words accomplished nothing. The core of the group began to be made up of workers instead of intellectuals, pushing the group and Georgia further down a socialist path. In 1902, a massive strike began in a plant in Batumi. Almost four hundred workers were dismissed from the plant and arrests occurred afterwards. When the workers began to march against the police, they were forced to fire into the crowd, killing fourteen workers in the process. The Dasi quickly created a Batumi committee, made up of two intellectuals and three workers. In the end, nearly six hundred workers were made to leave the city and many then returned to their farms and villages in Guria. It was this process that created even more revolution, as the workers met up with other social revolutionaries in Guria and created boycotts against the landlords late in the spring. Because the protests continued to spread, the Mesame Dasi were forced to lend their support to the workers. The original meaning of the boycotts had been about the poor harvest in 1901. But when the military and the police intervened, working for the case of the landlords, the boycotts became large political protests against Russian supremacy in Georgia and even against autocracy itself.\\"Stalin: a new history\\" - Google Books Later years By 1920, the Mesame Dasi had begun pushing out the older generations of national patriots, the first two groups. They began redirecting Georgian hostility toward the dominant local group, the Armenians for the Georgians, instead of the Russians as had been done before.\\"The Revenge of the Past: Nationalism, Revolution and the Collapse of the Soviet Union\\" - Google Books ReferencesBibliography * * External links *\\"Stalin ‚Äì An Appraisal of the Man and his Influence\\" - Marxists Internet Archive *\\"ZHORDANIA, NOE NIKOLAYEVICH\\" - Encyclopedia.com *\\"Joseph Stalin\\" - Grolier Category:Defunct political parties in Georgia (country) Category:Political history of Georgia (country) Category:Political parties of minorities in Imperial Russia Category:Social democratic parties Category:Socialist parties in Georgia (country) ","title":"Mesame Dasi"},{"id":"26558129","text":"The African-American Film Critics Association Awards 2007, honoring the best in filmmaking of 2007, were given on December 17, 2007.

Opened in 1970, the Pride Center of the Capital Region in Albany, New York is the oldest LGBTQ community center in the United States still operating from their original location. The LAGLC, was established in 1971 in Los Angeles, followed in close succession by other community centers in San Diego (1973), Chicago (1973), Salt Lake City (1975), and Atlanta (1976). The first LGBT community centre in the United Kingdom was the Birmingham Gay Community Centre which opened in 1976, with the London Lesbian and Gay Centre following in 1985. More were established in the coming decades in major cities throughout the Western world and Westernized countries due to the increasing visibility and respectability of LGBT cultures and society. In a few countries, LGBT community centers and their operators have federated into voluntary organizations for coordination purposes, i.e. CenterLink and the French Federation of LGBT Centres.

Singing career Cohen's first audition on American Idol was in 2008 during Season Seven in Philadelphia, where she sang \\"Somebody to Love\\" by Jefferson Airplane. All three judges voted \\"no,\\" eliminating her from the competition. Cohen returned for a second audition in 2009 for Idol‚Äòs Season Eight in Boston, singing the Madonna song, ‚ÄúLike a Prayer‚Äù. She again reacted negatively on camera after judge Simon Cowell called her performance \\"horrendous.\\" Cohen's performances on American Idol brought her a measure of fame, so much so that her death was covered by sources including People Magazine, Entertainment Weekly, MTV, Rolling Stone, ABC News, and The New York Daily News. Death Cohen was struck by a hit and run driver in Seaside Heights, New Jersey in July 2009.

It was recorded in June 1973 and released as a single in the US and UK the same year. Reviews were generally positive, but it failed to chart. \\"Sitting in the Midday Sun\\" was included on Preservation Act 1, released in November 1973. Act 1 peaked at number 177 on the US Billboard charts, but failed to make an impression on the UK charts. Background and recording Doug Hinman estimates that \\"Sitting in the Midday Sun\\" was the first track recorded at The Kinks' new Konk Studios. The song was recorded around 8 June, and was worked on along with several other tracks from the band's upcoming LP. Release and reception It was backed by \\"One of the Survivors\\" for its UK release, where it came out in June; for its August release in the US, \\"Sweet Lady Genevieve\\" was substituted. The single was given little promotion on either side of the Atlantic, and failed to chart, but was well received by the American rock press. Alan Betrock of Rock Marketplace wrote: \\"The new Kinks record has to bring smiles onto a lot of faces. ... 'Sitting in the Midday Sun' sounds like it could have come right off of Village Green and melodically and lyrically is quite fine.\\" Reception in the UK was mixed. Melody Maker praised \\"Sitting in the Midday Sun\\", noting its \\"lazy summer sound,\\" and calling it \\"another winning tune from Raymond Douglas Davies and the boys.\\" New Musical Express was mixed: \\"One of those lightweight singles The Kinks put out when they're waiting for Ray Davies to come up with something truly remarkable. It's an adequately pleasant little summer song that will do what it's supposed to do.\\" Disc called it \\"one of the week's better releases\\". Aftermath and album release \\"Sitting in the Midday Sun\\" was released during a period of turmoil for The Kinks‚Äîbandleader Ray Davies' marital problems with his wife Rasa came to a head nine days before the song's UK release when she left him, taking their children with her. Ray went into a state of depression; Doug Hinman wrote about his condition: \\"a week following his wife's departure, an emotionally distraught Ray [was] admitted to hospital for suspected barbiturate poisoning. He [was] treated and released.\\" Shortly after the incident, on 15 July, The Kinks made an infamous appearance at the White City Stadium. According to a Melody Maker review of the concert, \\"Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F...... sick of the whole thing'. ... He was 'Sick up to here with it' ... and those that heard shook their heads. Mick [Avory, drummer] just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummed on through 'Waterloo Sunset. At the show's conclusion, as pretaped music played on the sound system, Ray declared that he was quitting. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was rushed to hospital. Dave Davies later commented in an interview about the incident: > God, that was horrible. That was when Ray tried to top himself. I thought he > looked a bit weird after the show‚ÄîI didn't know that he'd taken a whole > bloody bottle of weird-looking psychiatric pills. It was a bad time. Ray > suddenly announced that he was going to end it all ... I think he took the > pills before the show. I said to him towards the end that he was getting a > bit crazy. I didn't know what happened‚ÄîI suddenly got a phone call saying he > was in the hospital. I remember going to the hospital after they'd pumped > his stomach and it was bad. With Ray Davies in a seemingly critical condition, plans were discussed for Dave to continue as frontman in a worst-case scenario. Ray eventually pulled through and recovered from his illness as well as his depression, but throughout the remainder of The Kinks' theatrical incarnation the band's output remained uneven, and their popularity, which had already faded, declined even more.Portions of this section (Aftermath and album release), namely the one concerning Ray Davies' incident at the White City Stadium, are closely modeled after or incorporate text from the \\"Theatrical incarnation (1973‚Äì1976)\\" section of The Kinks Wikipedia article. Modern opinion Modern criticism towards \\"Sitting in the Midday Sun\\" and Preservation as a whole is mixed. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called \\"Sitting in the Midday Sun\\" \\"endearingly lazy,\\" and noted it as one of the highlights of the album.

The current line up consists of David First (Guitar), Stephen Bilenky (Bass), and Barry Halkin (Drums). The band officially began in 1977 and was closely associated with the No Wave acts of New York City at the time. After a nearly thirty-year hiatus, the band has recently released their long-awaited first full-length album We're Here To Help on Prophase Records.  Before The Notekillers, formation and early history: 1968 - 1979  The Notekillers early history began when high- schoolers David First, Barry Halkin, and Stephen Bilenky began Dead Cheese, a local psychedelic rock band that played small gigs at local Philadelphia clubs and coffee houses between 1968 and 1971. Between 1971 and 1976 the members went their separate ways leaving Dead Cheese behind. During this break David First plays in an ensemble formed by avant-jazz legend Cecil Taylor that performed at Carnegie Hall. Also during this time First studies guitar & jazz theory with renowned instructor Dennis Sandole and analog & computer synthesis through auditing classes at Princeton University. He befriends a grad-student there who admires his nascent constructions and arranges to allow him unlimited access to the largely abandoned classical electronic music studio and tape machines where, driving up from Philadelphia, he creates his first works for the medium in after-hours sessions. In 1976, after a 5-year, break Halkin returns to Philadelphia. Halkin and First begin playing together once again. Soon, after years of mostly playing free-improv, First begins creating song-structures for the two of them inspired by what he had been listening to in the ensuing years- minimalist composers, long-time hero John Fahey, free jazz, funk music, reggae & various world musics and the emerging punk rock movement. In early 1977 Halkin & First play their first show ‚Äì a private party for friends ‚Äì as Notekillers. In late 1977 Stephen Bilenky joins on bass and the band begins playing in Philadelphia in clubs such as the Hot Club, Artemis, Grendel's Lair, Omni, Starlight Ballroom as well as a few local colleges. Mostly they are met with confusion or disdain, but they make one important ally in David Carroll ‚Äì Philadelphia's punk rock impresario who continues to book them despite the lack of local support. The band continues to play, mostly with local Philadelphia bands, but also open up for the Misfits in Bethlehem, Pa and DNA in Philadelphia. The band was scheduled to open for Sid Vicious, yet a week prior to the show Vicious dies and the show is canceled. In 1978 the band adds a fourth member, Thomas Johnson on congas. Johnson spends various lengths of time with the band, often coming and going from the line-up. Early Releases: 1979 - 1981 After more than two years of rehearsing six nights a week in the basement of Bilenky's father's hair salon (Beauty on a Budget) and being met mostly with resistance from the Philadelphia scene- The Notekillers feel physically and emotionally burnt out. The group decide to record a single with sound man Richard Bloom in a last- ditch attempt at making an impact. After finishing the recording, they take what is planned to be a six-month break to assess their lives and try to allow First to heal from repetitive stress/carpal tunnel syndrome, an ailment that had nagged him since soon after the band's inception. In 1980 The Notekillers release The Zipper b/w Clockwise on their own label ‚Äì AmericanBushmen Records. After a subsequent trip to New York City to shop the record to different outlets, store owner/label manager Ed Bahlman of 99 Records contacts the band, booking them for a show in New York City with Glenn Branca. Despite First's hand not having healed the band decides to return from the short hiatus. The band plays shows at Hurrah, CBGB, Maxwell's, amongst other locations in Philadelphia. During this period they play shows with the likes of such bands as The Feelies and The Bush Tetras. Break Up and Hiatus: 1981 - 2001 In 1981, despite getting favorable reviews in NYRocker[1] for the Hurrah show and in The Village Voice[2], Trouser Press[3], and Op Magazine for their single, The Notekiller's stop playing live shows. A second pair of songs, Run Don't Stop/Juggernauts, is recorded but never released. They continued to be cited (often without finding out till years later) after their breakup, including mentions in reference books Volume: International Discography of the New Wave[4], Who's New Wave in Music: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1976-1982[5], Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club[6], American Music in the 20th Century[7], and Spin Magazine[8]. In 1982 First leaves Philadelphia and in 1984 moves to NYC and begins to establish himself as composer of experimental music. During this early period time he led bands & ensembles such as Flatland Oscillators, The World Casio Quartet, and The Koan Pool. His ensembles included such artists as violinist Mark Feldman, cellist Jane Scarpantoni, Trumpeter Frank London & Saxophonist Ulrich Krieger. As the 90's began, and up to the present, First continued developing an international reputation, receiving numerous grants, awards and much critical acclaim (\\"a fascinating artist with a singular technique\\" in The New York Times, and \\"a bizarre cross between Hendrix and La Monte Young\\" in The Village Voice.) for his electronic and instrumental microtonal compositions and guitar improvisations. He performed often in New York as well as throughout Europe. In 1995 he created an opera about the AIDS crisis entitled, The Manhattan Book of the Dead which was presented both in NYC and Potsdam, Germany. During the hiatus, Halkin continues to build his name and reputation in the Photography community, was the drummer of a band called Devils Grippe and is currently the drummer for a punk band called Kandi Jones based out of Philadelphia. Bilenky starts Bilenky Cycle Works - an internationally renowned bicycle frame boutique shop. Reformation: 2001 - present After experimenting with adding beats to his drone music for a couple of years and doing some crossing over into the ambient techno scene, First begins in 1998 recording what he calls his \\"pop\\" album - Universary - subtitled \\"Songs, Drones and Refrains of life\\" that features Jane Scarpantoni, Shelly Hirsch, Michael Blake, Ulrich Krieger, Roy Campbell, Zeena Parkins, Bob Hoffnar, Tom Chiu, and First on guitar, vocals & programming. It is his first foray into songwriting in fifteen years. Unbeknownst to him, during this same period, after a long period of no musical activity, Halkin & Bilenky each independently return to playing in bands - Halkin playing drums in an r&b;/soul horn band and Bilenky playing guitar in an original rock band led by his then wife - a singer. In late 2001 Halkin received a call from an old friend informing him that Thurston Moore mentioned The Notekillers in an article in the winter 2001 issue of Mojo Collections magazine, as part of a mix-tape saying ‚ÄúThis is the tape I made for the band when we were starting out‚Äù and ‚Äúwe have to find out who these guys are‚Äù. First contacted Moore ‚Äì who he knew from his time spent in the New York City scene, and tells him that he, in fact, was a member of the band. Moore tells First that he used to hang around 99 and that Ed Bahlman played him The Zipper in 1980. Moore asked about other recorded materials as plans are born to release a CD of material on Moore's Ecstatic Peace! label. First - who had remained in contact with Halkin over the years - calls Bilenky to talk to him for the first time in almost 20 years to tell him what's going on. First proceeds to go through boxes of cassette and reel-to-reel tapes, listening to tracks he hasn't heard in years in order to compile the best possible archival material for the Ecstatic Peace! release. In 2004 as the album gets closer to release, The Notekillers begin talking about reuniting the band. By summer of the same year, they begin doing shows in the Philadelphia area. In October 2004 The Notekillers perform at a release party at Tonic in New York City. The bill included Thurston Moore, Jim O‚ÄôRourke, Maryanne Amacher, Magik Markers, and Mouthus. In the ensuing years since the release of Notekillers 1977-1981, there were two SXSW shows, multiple shows with Tortoise, Mayo Thompson, Enon, Gary Lucas' Gods & Monsters and participation in All Tomorrow's Parties ‚Äì the Nightmare Before Christmas - a three-day festival curated by Thurston Moore at Butlins in the UK. Work on their soon to be released return We're Here To Help started in early 2006. Two songs were recorded at their rehearsal studio and released to radio as well as digitally - Airport & Ants. Two more tracks Papers & Rebuttal were recorded during this period but were never released. Work ceased at that point when their recording engineer left town suddenly. In the fall of 2006, four more tracks were recorded in Manayunk, Pa. - Crash, Flamenco, Foster and Jumper. Nothing more happened until the fall of 2007 when some new songs were developed and recorded at their studio - Modern Jazz, Dreambook and Misslebones. Work began in earnest to finish all tracks and release the new album. Guest artists were included on some tracks - including Shelly Hirsch, voice, Lenny Pickett, baritone sax, and John Clark, French horn. First does major reworkings of basic songs by overdubbing guitars and electronics. During this time, the album cover - conceived by First and Halkin is created. Front cover drawings are commissioned from two cartoon artists Halkin meets at a local punk rock book fair and the back cover photograph is taken by Halkin. The front and back is designed by Sara Hodgson. All track mixing is finished by the fall of 2008. They begin mixing anew with new mixing engineer, Steve Silverstein (Christmas Decorations, The Bleaks, a.o.). After mixing and mastering is completed, the band is decidedly unsatisfied, deciding that though the tracks are good, the overdubs don't represent enough what they do as a live band. They decided to shelve the album for the time being, completely start over and during the summer of 2009 - with Steve Silverstein doing the recording - Notekillers record a mixture of brand new tracks and newer versions of some of the previous songs that they are finally happy with. In the winter of 2009 a much sparer set of overdubs is completed and in early 2010 mixing is begun by sound engineer Yianni Papadopoulos. Mixing is completed on April 12, 2010.

It was published and recorded at the beginning of the 20th century and has since become part of the repertoire of various Russian and foreign artists.  History  According to popular belief, the song was composed by convicts in Siberia towards the end of the 19th century. The revolutionary Ivan Belokonsky insisted, though, that it was known in Siberia in the 1880s, but there was no indication of the author of the lyrics. –ü–æ –î–∏–∫–∏–º –°—Ç–µ–ø—è–º –ó–∞–±–∞–π–∫–∞–ª—å—è According to Ivan Nazarov (and Alexander Smolik)–ê–ª—è–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –°–º–æ–ª—ñ–∫. –ë–æ–∂—ã –¥–∞—Ä –Ü–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –ö–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∞—Ü—å–µ–≤–∞ ‚Äî –ú—ñ–Ω—Å–∫: –ë–î–£–ö–ú, 2013. , Ivan Kondratyev was the author of the lyrics,–ò–≤–∞–Ω –ê–±—Ä–∞–º–æ–≤–∏—á –ù–∞–∑–∞—Ä–æ–≤, –í—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∏ –∏ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–∞ (Letters and Encounters), Vladimir, 1957. although the poem is not included in the latter's last published volume of poems, Under the noise of the Oak Groves.

The consequence of the revolution was that the head of the Viceroyalty, Viceroy Cisneros, was ousted from office, and role of government was assumed by the Primera Junta. There are many reasons, both local and international, that promoted such developments. International causes=United States Declaration of Independence Declaration of Independence of the United States inspired similar movements in the Spanish colonies in South America. The United States had emancipated themselves from the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1776, which provided a tangible example that led Criollos to believe that revolution and independence from Spain could be realistic aims. In the time between 1775 and 1783 the Thirteen Colonies started the American Revolution, first rejecting the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, and later the British monarchy itself, and waged the American Revolutionary War against their former rulers. The changes were not only political, but also intellectual and social, combining both a strong government with personal liberties. The text of the Declaration of Independence stated that all men are created equal (and thus become equal before the law), and had unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.The Declaration of Independence of the Thirteen Colonies They had also chosen a republican form of government, instead of keeping a monarchic one. Even more, the fact that Spain aided the colonies in their struggle against Britain weakened the argument that ending allegiance to the mother country could be considered a crime. French Revolution The French Revolution promoted new ideals that influenced local criollos. The ideals of the French Revolution of 1789 were spreading as well. During the Revolution, centuries of monarchy were ended with the overthrow and execution of the King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, and the removal of the privileges of the nobility. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was highly popular among the young Criollos. The French Revolution also boosted liberal ideals in political and economic fields. Some of the most notable political liberal authors, who opposed monarchies and absolutism, were Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Montesquieu, Denis Diderot and Jean Le Rond d'Alembert, while the most notorious economic liberal was Adam Smith. Liberal ideas also reached the church, and the concept of the divine right of kings started to be questioned. Francisco Su√°rez claimed that political power did not pass directly from God to the governor, but to the population and through it to the governor. According to Suarez, such power belongs to the people and is delegated to the governor, but if such governors did not serve the public good as they should, they would become tyrants and the people would have the right to fight them and choose new governors. The falling consensus about the divine right being legitimate gave room to monarchies being replaced by republics in France and the United States, but also to constitutional monarchies, such as in Great Britain. However, the spread of such idea was mainly forbidden in the Spanish territories, as well as the traffic in related books or their unauthorized possession. Such blockades started when Spain declared war on France after the execution of Louis XVI, but remained after the peace treaty of 1796. Nevertheless, the events of 1789 and the statements of the French Revolution spread around Spain despite the efforts to keep them at bay. Even more, the National Convention declared that France would give shelter and aid to all populations aiming to become free, and made many plans to disrupt the power of Spain over their overseas colonies. Many enlightened Criollos came into contact with those authors and their works during university studies. such as Manuel Belgrano in Spain or Mariano Moreno, Juan Jos√© Castelli or Bernardo Monteagudo at the American university in Chuquisaca. Books from the US also found their way into the Spanish colonies through Caracas, due to the closeness of Venezuela to the United States and West Indies. Industrial Revolution The Industrial Revolution started in Britain, with manual labour and horse-drawn vehicles being replaced by machine-based manufacturing and transportation aided by railways and steam power. This led to dramatic increases in the productive capabilities of Britain, and the need of new markets to sell the surplus of coal, steel and clothes. The Napoleonic Wars, where Britain was at war with France, made this a difficult task, after Napoleon countered the British naval blockade with the Continental System, not allowing Britain to trade with any other European country. Thus, England needed to be able to trade with the Spanish colonies, but could not do so because they were restricted to trade only with their own metropoli. For this end they tried to conquer key cities during the British invasions, and after it to promote their emancipation. The Industrial Revolution also gave room to authors who proposed a liberal economy, like Adam Smith. Fran√ßois Quesnay compared the worldwide economy with a living organism, stating that economics worked beyond political power and should not be affected by it. Peninsular War The Third of May 1808Joseph Bonaparte The Napoleonic wars were taking place in Europe, involving France, Great Britain and most European countries. Portugal broke the blockade imposed on British trade and, as a result, was invaded by France. However, the Royal Family and the bulk of the kingdom's administration fled to colonial Brazil, in a move to preserve Portuguese sovereignty. Under the pretext of reinforcing the Franco- Spanish army occupying Portugal, French Imperial troops began filing into Spain. Shortly before the Spanish King Charles IV abdicated due to the mutiny of Aranjuez and gave the throne to his son, Ferdinand VII. Feeling that he was forced to abdicate, Charles IV requested that Napoleon restore him to power. Napoleon helped remove Ferdinand VII from power, but did not return the crown to the former king: instead, he crowned his own brother Joseph Bonaparte, as the new Spanish King. This whole process is known as the Abdications of Bayonne. Joseph's designation found severe resistance in Spain, and the Junta of Seville took power in the absence of the King. Until then, Spain had been an ally of France against Britain, but at this point the Spanish resistance changed sides and allied with Britain against France. The Junta of Seville was eventually defeated as well, being replaced by another one located in C√°diz. National causes=Spanish monopsony During colonial times Spain was the only buyer of goods from the viceroyalty, and by law it was forbidden to trade with other nations. This situation damaged the viceroyalty, as Spain's economy was not powerful enough to buy and sell the quantities of goods that the Americas required. and many of them were even brought by Spain to France or Britain and then resold in the Americas at a higher price. Buenos Aires was even more damaged, as Spain did not send enough ships to the city. To prevent the risk of piracy the trade ships had to be followed by war ships, which made the journey very expensive. Lacking any gold or silver resources, or established indigenous populations to employ systems of encomienda, it was more profitable for Spain to send them all to Mexico or Lima. This led Buenos Aires to develop a system of smuggling to obtain, by illegal means, the products that could not be received otherwise. This smuggling was allowed by most local authorities, and developed similar amounts of traffic as the legal commerce with Spain. This whole situation developed two antagonistic groups: the ones who made leather products and wanted free commerce to be able to sell them, and the ones who benefited from the prices of the smuggled products, which would have to sell them at lower prices if such commerce was allowed. Social rivalries In the political structure most authoritative positions were filled by people designated by the Spanish monarchy, most of them Spanish people from Europe, without strong compromises with American problems or interests. This created a growing rivalry between the Criollos, people born in America, and the Peninsulares, people arrived from Europe (the term \\"Criollo\\" is usually translated to English as \\"Creole\\", despite being unrelated to most other Creole peoples). Despite the fact that all of them were considered Spanish, and that there was no legal distinction between Criollos and Peninsulares, most Criollos thought that Peninsulares had undue weight in political conflicts and expected a higher intervention in them, sentiment shared by the lower clergy. This practice was mainly the result of social prejudice. Criollos were also angered by the ease of immigrants from Spain, regardless of having humble origins, to acquire properties and social distinction that was negated to them. This rivalry evolved later into a rivalry between supporters of becoming autonomous from Spain and supporters of keeping things the way they were. However, this process was much slower than the one experimented by the British colonies in North America, in part because the educative system was managed almost exclusively by the clergy, influencing the development of a population as conservative as in the mother country. Unlike the European countries and, to some degree, the United States, the Spanish colonies lacked a sense of peoplehood, a needed factor for the development of a nation. The Spanish colonies were carefully designed as extensions of Spain itself, being completely dependent in economic, cultural and political terms to the mother country.* British Invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata Beresford surrenders to Santiago de Liniers. Work by Charles Fouqueray. Buenos Aires and Montevideo had successfully resisted two British invasions. The first one was in 1806, when a British army led by William Carr Beresford took control of Buenos Aires, until it was defeated by an army from Montevideo, led by Santiago de Liniers. The following year a bigger army took Montevideo, but failed to take Buenos Aires, being forced to surrender and leave both cities. There was no Spanish aid from Europe either time, and to prepare for the second invasion Liniers formed militias with Criollos, despite regulations prohibiting such militias. This gave them military power and political influence they did not have before, with the biggest Criollo army being the Patricios Regiment led by Cornelio Saavedra. This victory achieved without help also boosted confidence in independence, by showing that Spanish aid was not needed. The prestige earned by Buenos Aires before the other cities of the viceroyalty was exploited by Juan Jos√© Paso during the open cabildo to justify taking immediate action and hearing the opinions of other cities afterwards. Carlotism Carlota Joaquina of Spain desired to rule the Spanish colonies. By the ending of 1808 the whole Royal Family of Portugal left Europe, with the country being attacked by Napoleon, and settled in Brazil. The regent prince arrived with his wife, Charlotte Joaquina, daughter of Charles IV and sister of Ferdinand VII. When the news of the imprisonment of Ferdinand VII arrived in South America, Charlotte tried to take control of the viceroyalties as regent, a project known as Carlotism. She could do so due to the derogation of the salic law by Charles IV in 1789, and she intended to prevent a French invasion in the Americas. Some Criollos like Castelli, Beruti, Vieytes and Belgrano supported the project, considering it a chance to get a local government instead of one in Europe, or a medium for a later declaration of independence. Other Criollos like Moreno, Paso or Saavedra were critics of it, as well as most peninsular Spaniards and Viceroy Liniers. They suspected the whole project of concealing Portuguese ambitions in the region, and her public image wasn't positive: the people around her in Brazil (like the infant Pedro Carlos de Bourbon), and her relations with her husband, caused strong public dislike. Charlotte also rejected her supporters, as they intended her to lead a constitutional monarchy, while she wanted to retain an absolute monarchy. Britain, with strong presence in Portugal, also opposed the project: they did not want to let Spain, now allied with them against France, be split into many kingdoms, and did not consider Charlotte able to prevent separatism.

Price, \\"Viterbo: landscape of an Italian city\\", Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 54.2 (June 1964:242-75) . Viterbo became a papal city in 1243. During the later thirteenth century, the ancient Italian city of Viterbo was the site of five papal elections and the residence of seven popes and their Curias, and it remains the location of four papal tombs. These popes resided in the Palazzo dei Papi di Viterbo alongside the Viterbo Cathedral intermittently for two decades, from 1257 to 1281; as a result, the papal palace in Viterbo, with that in Orvieto, are the most extensive thirteenth- century papal palaces to have survived.Gary M. Radke, \\"Medieval Frescoes in the Papal Palaces of Viterbo and Orvieto\\", Gesta, 1984; Radke, Viterbo: Profile of a Thirteenth Century Papal Palace, 1996. Shifting political and economic alliances pushed and pulled various popes of that century from Rome, taking refuge in other, not invariably hospitable, Italian city-states like Perugia and Orvieto. The primary cleavage in these divisions was between the Angevin and Hohenstaufen claimants to the title of Holy Roman Emperor, whom the pope could crown. Prior papal connections According to the Catholic Encyclopedia article on Viterbo, \\"during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the city several times afforded the popes an asylum.\\" Pope Paschal II (1099‚Äì1118) was brought to Viterbo as a prisoner in 1111, and when Pope Adrian IV (1154‚Äì1159) met with Frederick Barbarossa in the city in 1155, the city was firmly in the Emperor's hands Antipopes Paschal III (1164‚Äì1168) and Callixtus III (1168‚Äì1178) took shelter in Viterbo, where the nobility had Ghibelline loyalties, but‚Äîaccording to the Catholic Encyclopedia‚Äîmuch of the populace remained loyal to Pope Alexander III. Viterbo rebelled against the Emperor after the peace between pope and Emperor was concluded. Pope Innocent III (1198‚Äì1216) issued a papal bull from Viterbo in 1214.William Heywood (1910) A History of Perugia, p. 35. Viterbo remained loyal to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, and refused to admit Pope Gregory IX in 1232. A series of sieges brought the city back and forth between Guelf and Ghibelline loyalty.

He inherited his predecessor's allegiance to the Hohenstaufen claimants to the Holy Roman Empire but quickly turned against them. Because of the strength of the Ghibelline faction in Rome, he withdrew to Viterbo in 1257 until his death in 1261. Alexander IV began enlarging the bishop's residence by the cathedral, and the Papal Palace was completed probably in 1266. Alexander IV's successor, Pope Urban IV, returned to Viterbo from the Crusades and was present there when Alexander IV died. A non-cardinal, Urban IV moved to Perugia upon his election, where he died. Urban IV spent the winter and spring of 1261‚Äì1262 in Viterbo. Urban IV's successor, Pope Clement IV, was elected in Perugia, but established himself in Viterbo, where he remained until his death. Clement IV established permanent residence in Viterbo in 1266. He did not even return to Rome for the crowning of Charles of Anjou as the Holy Roman Emperor by the College of Cardinals. The election after Clement IV's death, in Viterbo, lasted three years. Pope Gregory X, a non-cardinal away on the Crusades, was finally elected. Gregory X returned to Rome, and died in Arezzo, while returning from the Second Council of Lyon. in France. His successor, Pope Innocent V also resided in Rome. Pope Adrian V was pope for a little over a month, and accomplished little other than dying in Viterbo before even being ordained a priest. His Portuguese successor, Pope John XXI remained in Viterbo. John XXI expanded the papal palace in Viterbo, and died when a section of the roof collapsed on him. The next pope, Pope Nicholas III, although from the powerful Roman Orsini family, also died in Viterbo in 1280. During the ensuing election, the magistrates of Viterbo threw two Orsini cardinals into prison. By the time his successor, Pope Martin IV, was elected, Viterbo had been placed under interdict, and because the French pope was resented in Rome, he was crowned in Orvieto. The influence of Viterbo on the papacy declined after Martin IV's death in Perugia in 1285. Pope Pius II was in Viterbo in 1462 to celebrate the feast of Corpus Christi.Ludwig Pastor (2009) The History of the Popes, BiblioBazaar, LLC, p. 95 Architecture=Papal palace The loggia of the papal palace The palace at Viterbo had been the residence of the Bishop of Viterbo until the 1250s. Alexander IV (1254‚Äì1261) enlarged the palace for use as a papal residence. A large three- storied addition was completed in 1266, during the reign of Clement IV (1264‚Äì1268). The palace was redecorated in the 1290s, and some of the new additions bear the Caetani coat-of-arms of Pope Boniface VIII (1294‚Äì1303). According to Prof. Radke, although Boniface VIII never even visited Viterbo during his papacy, \\"the papal arms indicate that the structure had not completely lost its papal associations.\\" According to Prof. Radke, \\"the papal palaces in Viterbo and Orvieto are the most extensive thirteenth-century papal palaces to survive to our own day.\\"Gary M. Radke. 1984. \\"Medieval Frescoes in the Papal Palaces of Viterbo and Orvieto.\\" Gesta 23(1): 27-38.

It is sung between Elphaba, Galinda (later Glinda), and the students at Shiz University, expressing their loathing for each other's contrasting personalities as newly- assigned roommates. Context The song is performed towards the beginning of the first act. It opens with the two girls, Galinda and Elphaba, writing letters home to their parents in order to complain about their new rooming situation at Shiz University, brought about by Madame Morrible. During the song, Galinda and Elphaba graphically detail their mutual and \\"unadulterated loathing\\" toward one another. As the song progresses, the students of Shiz side with Galinda, expressing their admiration of the fact that she can even tolerate Elphaba, and referring to her as a martyr. The students rally around Galinda and ally against Elphaba, who is universally despised. They claim they will maintain their animosity for their entire lives, stating that every little trait of Elphaba's makes their skin crawl. Elphaba makes the students aware that these feelings are reciprocated, although she does not reveal whether her hatred extends to all of the students, or is reserved exclusively for Galinda. During the later song, \\"Dancing Through Life\\", Galinda's loathing of Elphaba is manifested yet again when, in order to embarrass her in front of everyone at the Ozdust Ballroom, she presents her with a pointed black hat, clearly representative of those traditionally associated with witchcraft, that Galinda received from her grandmother. However, Galinda's conscience soon starts to get the better of her, and in her remorse she approaches Elphaba with an invitation to dance, culminating in the pair eventually becoming friends in \\"Popular\\". Lyrics Stephen Schwartz meant the song's title and lyrics to be an ironic parody on love songs (\\"What is this feeling so sudden and new?/I felt the moment I laid eyes on you/My pulse is rushing/My head is reeling/My face is flushing/What is this feeling?/Fervid as a flame/Does it have a name?\\"). The irony comes in when phrases traditionally used for love songs are revealed to be expressing hate. When Galinda and Elphaba describe each other, Galinda complains about Elphaba being \\"altogether quite impossible to describe\\", while Elphaba simply calls Galinda \\"blonde\\". At the end of the song, Elphaba scares Galinda, by saying \\"Boo\\", with Galinda letting out a high-pitched squeal.

Based on the 1936 novel by Emery Bonett with the same title, the plot features a group of chorus line girls who compete for the affection of a distinguished bachelor. Summary Leslie James (Margaret Lockwood), a stage name taken by a young woman who runs away from a finishing school, falls in with a carefree group of chorus line girls who fancy themselves for attracting wealthy men. Upon hearing that a royal bachelor, the Earl of Pangborough, will be returning home after years abroad, Gloria Lind (Ren√©e Houston) positions herself on the arm of the bachelor and invites him to a chorus line performance. Clytie Devine (Lilli Palmer), after hearing about the Earl, realizes that Gloria Lind had cheated her out of a chance to meet the wealthy bachelor and a raucous fight occurs between the two women. At the chorus line performance, the Earl meets all the women and, afterward, attends a party with them. That evening, each of the three women take turns attracting the Earl. Soon after, the entire dance troupe is invited to the castle-like home of the Earl, where he resides with his mother and house staff. At the mansion, the three women hatch their plans for seducing the Earl, much to the displeasure of his mother. Clytie and Gloria, respectively, attempt to seduce the Earl with the help of the chorus line's con-man assistant, who is looking for his own way to capitalize on the situation. Leslie James, after winning the Earl's affection, admits to her manipulative lies and shows that she has, in fact, become emotionally involved.

Its species are mycorrhizal, forming a range of associations with trees, orchids, and other plants. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are produced on soil and litter, sometimes partly encrusting stems of living plants. The fruit bodies are cartilaginous to rubbery-gelatinous and variously effused to coral-shaped. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, but fewer than a dozen species are currently recognized worldwide. Taxonomy The genus was first published in 1871 by Louis and Charles Tulasne who had discovered that two species (Sebacina incrustans and S. epigaea) previously referred to Corticium or Thelephora possessed septate basidia, similar to those found in the genus Tremella. Although it was unusual at that time to separate fungal genera on purely microscopic characters, Sebacina was erected for effused, Corticium-like fungi with tremelloid basidia. Subsequent authors added many additional species to the genus. Most, however, proved unrelated to Sebacina and were removed in 1957 by Ervin, who shuffled some species to Heterochaetella (for example, Heterochaetella dubia, now Stypella dubia (Bourdot & Galzin) P. Roberts), Bourdotia and Exidiopsis. In 1961, Wells also transferred many species to the genus Exidiopsis. The type species, S. incrustans, has a variable morphology, which has led to it being assigned a number of names. Recent molecular research has shown that Sebacina is far more diverse than previously assumed, though this genetic diversity may not be reflected in morphological characters (in other words, species may be impossible to distinguish except by DNA analysis). The same research also shows that the genus splits into two groups, one clustered with the type species, the other clustered with a species sometimes referred to as \\"Sebacina vermifera\\" (though this is a misidentification). This latter species is distinct in forming thin, waxy fruit bodies and the group may not be part of Sebacina in the strict sense. Even in the strict sense, Sebacina is artificial, not being clearly distinct from related genera such as the coral-like Tremellodendron. Description Fruit bodies are typically cartilaginous or rubbery-gelatinous. In effused species (those that spread out loosely or flat), they are formed on the soil surface or in leaf litter, often encrusting fallen twigs and debris, sometimes encrusting the stem bases of living plants. In the type species, irregular or coral-like outgrowths may also be produced. In one species, bracket-like outgrowths are formed. In two other species, the fruit bodies are entirely coral- or net-like. Spores are white in mass. Microscopic characters Fruit bodies are composed of hyphae lacking clamp connections in a gelatinous matrix. In one species the hyphal system is dimitic. The spore-bearing surface is initially covered in a layer of weakly branched hyphidia below which the basidia are formed. The basidia are tremelloid (ellipsoid and vertically septate), giving rise to long, sinuous sterigmata or epibasidia on which the basidiospores are produced. These spores are typically ellipsoid to oblong, but allantoid (sausage-shaped) in one species and vermiform (worm-shaped) in another. Mycorrhizal associations Sebacina species were assumed to be saprotrophic until DNA analysis of mycorrhizal roots showed that they were plant associates. They are now known to be ectomycorrhizal associates of forest trees as well as endomycorrhizal associates of orchids. They also form mycorrhizas with ericoid plants. Recent research has additionally revealed their presence on a range of non-mycorrhizal plant roots, suggesting they may be common root endophytes.

Assume that M^n admits a C^1-transversely oriented codimension one foliation F with a non empty set of singularities all of them centers. Then the singular set of F consists of two points and M^n is homeomorphic to the sphere S^n. It is a consequence of the Reeb stability theorem. Generalization More general case is c>s\\\\ge 0. In 1978, Edouar Wagneur generalized the Reeb sphere theorem to Morse foliations with saddles. He showed that the number of centers cannot be too much as compared with the number of saddles, notably, c\\\\le s+2. So there are exactly two cases when c>s: :(1) c=s+2, :(2) c=s+1. He obtained a description of the manifold admitting a foliation with singularities that satisfy (1). Theorem:. Let M^n be a compact connected manifold admitting a Morse foliation F with c centers and s saddles. Then c\\\\le s+2. In case c=s+2, * M is homeomorphic to S^n, * all saddles have index 1, * each regular leaf is diffeomorphic to S^{n-1}. Finally, in 2008, C√©sar Camacho and Bruno Scardua considered the case (2), c=s+1. This is possible in a small number of low dimensions. Theorem:. Let M^n be a compact connected manifold and F a Morse foliation on M. If s = c + 1, then * n=2,4,8 or 16, * M^n is an Eells‚ÄìKuiper manifold.

She married Harry Gates, and after his death, she married Tom Gates in 1915. Women's civic clubs Gates was active in the General Federation of Women's Clubs. In the 1920s, she was the founder of the Charleston Business and Professional Women's Club, and the Women's Democratic Executive Committee. Political career Gates began her political career by working with suffrage organizations in Kanawha County, distinguishing herself as an activist and gaining respect in the community. She remained politically active after women gained the right to vote and established herself as a successful voice for the Democratic Party in her area of West Virginia. She served as associate chairman of the Democratic executive committee of Kanawha County in 1920. In July 1922, Gates announced her candidacy for a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates. Her election would make her the first women to hold a seat in the West Virginia Legislator. West Virginia legislator Gates was a trailblazer with her accomplishments as a female legislator in West Virginia in the 1920s. During her first speech as a member of the West Virginia Legislature, Gates commented, ‚ÄúWomen in most states are awakening to their political responsibilities. The women do not urge the election of women as women, but believe women should be represented in office, and only ask for cooperation.‚Äù While in the legislature, Gates served as the Chairperson of the Committee on Arts, Science and General Improvements. She also was on the prohibition and temperance, education, humane institution and public buildings, and medicine and sanitation committees. Later community service Although Gates did not seek reelection for her seat in the Legislature, she continued to remain politically active and served on the city and county Democratic committees. She was a delegate to the 1932 National Democratic Convention in Chicago when Franklin D. Roosevelt was nominated as the candidate for President of the United States. Red Cross Gates volunteered for the Red Cross during World War II, and she was the secretary of Charleston Board of Affairs. Death and legacy Gates died at age 49 after an illness of more than three years after receiving treatment at the Mayo Clinic at Rochester, MN. She is buried in Spring Hill cemetery.

It was among the ludi (\\"games\\"), celebrated at imperial funerals, temple foundings, or in honor of a military victory. The lusus was occasionally presented at the Saecular Games, but was not attached regularly to a particular religious festival.Daniel P. Harmon, \\"The Religious Significance of Games in the Roman Age,\\" in The Archaeology of the Olympics (University of Wisconsin Press, 1988), p. 250. Participation was a privilege for boys of the nobility (nobiles).John Scheid and Jesper Svenbro, The Craft of Zeus: Myths of Weaving and Fabric (Penn State Press, 1996), p. 41. It was a display of communal skill, not a contest.Francis Cairns, Virgil's Augustan Epic (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 1990), pp. 226 and 246 online. Description The fullest description of the exercise is given by Vergil, Aeneid 5.545‚Äì603, as the final event in the games held to commemorate the anniversary of the death of Aeneas's father, Anchises. The drill features three troops (turmae) ‚Äî each made up of twelve riders, a leader, and two armor-bearers ‚Äî who perform intricate drills on horseback: : ‚Ä¶ The column split apart As files in the three squadrons all in line Turned away, cantering left and right; recalled They wheeled and dipped their lances for a charge. They entered then on parades and counter-parades, The two detachments, matched in the arena, Winding in and out of one another, And whipped into sham cavalry skirmishes By baring backs in flight, then whirling round With leveled points, then patching up a truce And riding side by side. So intricate In ancient times on mountainous Crete they say The Labyrinth, between walls in the dark, Ran criss-cross a bewildering thousand ways Devised by guile, a maze insoluble, Breaking down every clue to the way out. So intricate the drill of Trojan boys Who wove the patterns of their prancing horses, Figured, in sport, retreats and skirmishes ‚Ä¶Translation by Robert Fitzgerald of Vergil, Aeneid 5.580‚Äì593: olli discurrere pares atque agmina terni / diductis soluere choris, rursusque uocati / conuertere uias infestaque tela tulere. / inde alios ineunt cursus aliosque recursus / aduersi spatiis, alternosque orbibus orbis / impediunt pugnaeque cient simulacra sub armis; / et nunc terga fuga nudant, nunc spicula uertunt / infensi, facta pariter nunc pace feruntur. / ut quondam Creta fertur Labyrinthus in alta / parietibus textum caecis iter ancipitemque / mille uiis habuisse dolum, qua signa sequendi / frangeret indeprensus et inremeabilis error; / haud alio Teucrum nati uestigia cursu / impediunt texuntque fugas et proelia ludo. Complex intertwining manoeuvres as a display of horsemanship were characteristic of Roman cavalry reviews on the parade ground. The Greek military writer Arrian describes these in his book The Art of Military Tactics (Technƒì Taktikƒì), and says they originated among the non-Roman cavalry units provided by the allies (auxilia), particularly the Gauls (that is, the continental Celts) and Iberians.As described by Arrian, Technƒì Taktikƒì (Latin Ars tactica) 32‚Äì44; see description and diagram, Brian Campbell, Greek and Roman Military Writers: Selected Readings (Routledge, 2004), p. 44 online, and A.M. Devine, ‚ÄúArrian‚Äôs Tactica,‚Äù Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.34.1 (1993), p. 331 online. The Troy Game, however, was purely ceremonial and involved youths too young for military service. History and origin The lusus Troiae was \\"revived\\" by Julius Caesar in 45 or 46 BC,Suetonius, Divus Iulius 39; Cassius Dio 43.23.6. perhaps in connection with his family claim to have descended from Iulus, the son of Aeneas who in the game of the Aeneid rides a horse that was a gift from the Carthaginian queen Dido.Vergil, Aeneid 5.570‚Äì572; Petrini, The Child and the Hero, p. 35. Given the mythological setting, the description of the lusus Troiae in the Aeneid is likely to have been the Augustan poet's fictional aetiology.Mark Petrini, The Child and the Hero: Coming of Age in Catullus and Vergil (University of Michigan Press, 1997), p. 93 online. Historically, the event cannot be shown to have been held before the time of Sulla,The evidence for the game under Sulla is Plutarch, Cato Minor 3. Unless otherwise noted, citations of sources from Atze J. Keulen, L. Annaeus Seneca: Troades (Brill, 2001), p. 403 online. and it has been doubted that the lusus presented under Sulla was the Troy Game. A similar-sounding event during the ludi Romani at the time of the Second Punic War is also uncertain as evidence for an earlier staging.Scheid and Svenbro, The Craft of Zeus, p. 40. Panel from the Gundestrup Cauldron sometimes interpreted as depicting an equestrian ritual of initiation Detail of foot soldiers from the opposite side of the Truia wine-server The claim that the event \\"extends back at least to the sixth century B.C.\\" is based in part on a late 7th-century Etruscan wine-server (oinocho√´) from Tragliatella (near Caere) which depicts mounted youths emerging from a labyrinth with the legend TRUIA, one possible meaning of which is Troy.Harmon, \\"The Religious Significance of Games in the Roman Age,\\" p. 249 online. The Truia wine-server has been regarded as a key piece of evidence in tracing the spread of the Cretan Labyrinth design from Greece first into Etruscan Italy and from there into central and northern Europe, the British Isles, and Iberia; see John L. Heller and Stewart S. Cairns, \\"To Draw a Labyrinth,\\" in Classical Studies Presented to Ben Edwin Perry by His Students and Colleagues at the University of Illinois, 1924‚Äì60 (University of Illinois Press, 1969), pp. 236‚Äì262, on the Truia labyrinth especially pp. 236, 238, 261‚Äì262, and Heller again, \\"A Labyrinth from Pylos?\\" American Journal of Archaeology 65 (1961) 57‚Äì62. Vergil explicitly compares the patterns of the drill to the Cretan Labyrinth, which was associated with the geranos (\\"crane dance\\") taught by Theseus to the Athenian youth he rescued from the Minotaur there. In myth and ritual, the labyrinth, and hence the lusus, has been interpreted as \\"a return from danger, a triumph of life over death,\\"Harmon, \\"The Religious Significance of Games in the Roman Age,\\" p. 250. or more specifically as an initiation ritual.H.S. Versnel, \\"Apollo and Mars One Hundred Years after Roscher,\\" in Visible Religion: Annual for Religious Iconography. Approaches to Iconology (Brill, 1985‚Äì86), p. 148 online. The geranos of Theseus serves as a \\"mythic prototype for the escape of initiates from the rigors of initiation\\"; the feet of the shield-bearers on the Truia wine-server may suggest dance steps.Thomas Habinek, The World of Roman Song: From Ritualized Speech to Social Order (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), pp. 18‚Äì19 online, where the Truia vessel is discussed at greater length, with more on the crane dance and the labyrinth pp. 1950‚Äì1951. Initiation iconography similar to that of the Etruscan oinocho√´ is found on a panel of the Gundestrup Cauldron, generally regarded as presenting Celtic subject matter with a Thracian influence in workmanship.Kim R. McCone, ‚ÄúWerewolves, Cyclopes, D√≠berga, and F√≠anna: Juvenile Delinquency in Early Ireland,‚Äù Cambridge Medieval Celtic Studies 12 (1986) 1‚Äì22; John T. Koch, Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-Clio, 2006), pp. 908 online and 1489‚Äì1490. At least one of the Celtic polities of central Gaul, the Aedui, claimed like the Romans to be of Trojan descent and were formally recognized by the Roman senate as the \\"brothers\\" as well as the allies of Rome long before they were incorporated into the empire.Aeduos fratres consanguineosque saepe numero a senatu appellatos: Julius Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1.332, see also 1.36.5, 43.6, 44.9. There is some possibility that the Aeduan \\"senate,\\" as Caesar refers to their equivalent political body, is meant. The most explicit claim of Trojan origin for the Aedui is made by Ammianus Marcellinus 15.9.5. A similar claim is made for the Arverni by Lucan and Sidonius Apollinaris. For full discussion of the evidence, see D.C. Braund, \\"The Aedui, Troy, and the Apocolocyntosis,\\" Classical Quarterly 30 (1980) 420‚Äì425. The Etruscan designation of the game as \\"Truia\\", if that is what the vase depicts, may be a play on words, as truare means \\"to move,\\" with a specialized sense in the vocabulary of weaving: it has been argued that the lusus Troiae is the \\"running thread game,\\" intended to repair the \\"social fabric\\" of Rome after the recent civil wars.Scheid and Svenbro, The Craft of Zeus, pp. 45‚Äì48. The Troy Game was performed on a purification day (dies lustri).Seneca, Troades 777f. Vergil uses two forms of the verb \\"to weave\\" to describe the equestrian movements, and in some versions of the Theseus myth, the hero's return from the labyrinth is made possible by following a daedalean thread provided by Ariadne.Textum (5.589) and texunt (5.593). Claudian describes a similar event in his Panegyric on the Sixth Consulship of the Emperor Honorius, Bill Thayer's edition at LacusCurtius, English translation and Latin line 615ff., where the \\"interwoven retreats\\" (textas ‚Ä¶ fugas, 623) are also compared to the Cretan (as Gortynia) labyrinth and to the course of the Meander River (hence English \\"meander\\") near Troy. The game may have connections to Mars, who was associated with horses through his Equirria festivals and the ritual of the October Horse, as a patron of warrior youth. Mars' youthful armed priests the Salii performed dance steps expressed by forms of the verb truare, here perhaps meaning \\"to perform a truia dance.\\" The Troy Game was supervised by the Tribunes of the Celeres, who are connected to the Salii in the Fasti Praenestini.H.S. Versnel, \\"Apollo and Mars One Hundred Years after Roscher,\\" in Visible Religion: Annual for Religious Iconography. Approaches to Iconology (Brill, 1985‚Äì86), p. 148, citing Festus 270 (M√ºller). Augustus established the lusus Troiae as a regular event.Frequentissime: Suetonius, Augustus 43. Its performance was part of a general interest in Trojan origins reflected also in the creation of the Tabulae Iliacae or \\"Trojan Tablets,\\" low reliefs that illustrate scenes from the Iliad and often present text in the form of acrostics or palindromes, suggesting patterned movement or literary mazes.Thomas Habinek, \\"Situating Literacy at Rome,\\" in Ancient Literacies: The Culture of Reading in Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2009), pp. 127‚Äì129 online, including a diagram; Piotr Rypson, \\"Homo quadratus in labyrintho: The Cubus Visual Poem from Antiquity until Late Baroque,\\" European Iconography East and West.

In 1987 she met and married Lynrod Douglas, a Trinidadian-American then living in New York. The couple had met through a mutual friend while in Toronto for the Caribana festival and married after a four-month courtship. In 1989 the couple founded Black Pages Network to publish a Yellow Pages type directory of Black-owned businesses and organizations out of a need to provide a vehicle for recycling dollars in the Black and Caribbean community. Redway served in the capacity of president. Focused on Black economic empowerment themes such as \\"Recycling dollars in the community\\" and \\"Diversity means business\\", the project generated considerable publicity in the local and national media and the company would go on to play a key role in the promotion, development and support of the Black business community and would play a pioneering role in leading the ethnic directory trend in Canada. Black Pages may not have been the first ethnic directory in Canada, but following its success, ethnic directories began popping up in cultural communities across the country. She helped organize Black Business Week and the Canadian Black Community Showcase in 1992, and was listed in the premier edition of Who's Who in Ontario. In 1993, the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto officially proclaimed October 1‚Äì8 Black Business Week in support of the work the company was doing with Black businesses. Under Redway's leadership, Black Pages Network undertook the first known survey of Black businesses in Canada to identify issues faced by Black business owners. Conducted in conjunction with Dr. Frances Henry of York University, the study was published under the title \\"A Survey of Black Businesses in Metro Toronto\\" in 1992. Among the main findings of the survey was that the business participation rate among the Black population was less than one-third that of the general population in Toronto; and that racism was a barrier to business success. To counter this trend Black Pages initiated \\"Minority Youth in Business Day\\", an annual event which encouraged Black youth to consider self- employment as a viable career option. Ten years later, a second collaboration, this time with social geographer, Dr. Carlos Teixeria of the University of Toronto, undertook the study, \\"Black Entrepreneurs in The Toronto Census Metropolitan Area\\" (2002). The major findings of this study echoed findings of the first survey when it showed that Blacks experienced unique challenges when establishing their businesses with access to capital being the most crucial limiting factor. Jump Promotions International Black Pages was sold in 2003 after which Redway and Douglas established Jump Promotions International, a company specializing in three main areas: Publishing, Events Planning and Small Business Consulting.

In Ukraine (in Ukrainian documents) the spelling of the name recently changed to Halina or Halyna due to Ukrainian pronunciation. Nicknames include Gala, Galochka, Galya, Galka and Galechka. In Russia and other Slavic states, Galya is the most common nickname. The origin of the name could be interpreted in two different meanings, however, both are derives from the Ancient Greek Mythology, the First from ‚ÄúGALANE‚Äù - GALAXY of Serenity, Tranquility and Calmness in Greek and Roman - Galaxy - the Greek name for the Milky Way (ŒìŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒæŒØŒ±œÇ Galaxias) is derived from the Greek word for milk (Œ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ±, gala).

This legal act was written in simple folk language and its basic purpose was to organize continuation and functioning of the Serbian kingdom and the Serbian church. It was originally printed under the name ‚ÄûRules of Speech‚Äú (‚Äû–ü—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∞ –ì–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∞‚Äú) in the language of Ra≈°ka, in two issues, one for Vla≈°ka and another one for Erdelja in 1640. Byzantine nomocanons The first time a church codex like this is mentioned was in 451. in relation to decisions made on the council of Chalcedon. This codex includes a synopsis of all the rules. It is believed that this codex was written by Stefan Efesian which is why it was named The Synopsis of Stefan Efesian. John III Sholasticus, the Patriarch of Constantinople, was the writer of the first church-civil codex in which the subject is arranged systematically considering the questions that it deals with. The twelve Novellae of tsar Justinian that are related to the subject of church and law are also a part of this codex. It is known as the Nomocanon of John Sholasticus (somewhere around the 550.) and the Syntagma of John Sholasticus (–°–∏–Ω—Ç–∞–≥–º–∞ –à–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –°—Ö–æ–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞). Nomocanons that contain the rules but not the explanations are also called syntagmas. In the beginning of the seventh century two important acts were combined into one. The Canon Syntagma, written by patriarch Sergius, and a codex that was made as a part of Justinian‚Äôs law, by an unknown author, were taken by a jurist named Julian who turned them into a new codex named Nomocanon in 14 Titles (–ù–æ–º–æ–∫–∞–Ω–æ–Ω —É 14 –Ω–∞—Å–ª–æ–≤–∞). In the 883. into the nomocanon were added the rules made on the Trullan and Second council of Nicaea, the rules made on the Constantinople assemblies and on a great number of civil assemblies. Patriarch Photios wrote a foreword of this nomocanon which is why it was named after him. The nomocanon of Photios was proclaimed an official law document of the Christian church by the four eastern patriarchs, on their council in Constantinople in 920. Nomocanon of Methodius The first slavic nomocanon was written by Methodius (somewhere around 868.). It was mentioned in The Kingdom of Slavs (–ö—Ä–∞—ô–µ–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ –°–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω–∞) by a priest from Bar, written somewhere between 1167 and 1173. This nomocanon got its name, Liber Sclavorum qui dicitur Methodius, after his writer, slavic enlightener Methodius. The Liber Sclavorum qui dicitur Methodius was made out of two codexes- Methodius‚Äôs translation of Nomocanon by John Sholasticus and Slavic alternation of Eclogue (–ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω —Å—É–¥—ö–∏ —ô—É–¥–µ–º). Eclogue is byzantine codex, dating from the mid of eight century. It was most likely written by Leo III or Constantine V as a short version of Justinian‚Äôs codex. Methodius‚Äôs nomocanon was written just before Methodius went off to Donja Panonija to visit Prince Kocelj (869-870 and 873-874) and it applied to all Slavs. Content of Zakonopravilo Zakonopravilo consists out of 7 introductory chapters: 1\\\\.

Saint Sava expands the boundaries of social justice, confronting the norms of Byzantine civil law and slave society. He accentuates the christian teaching about social justice, justifying it by saying that norms should serve a man and not the public interest. There are a lot of rules about social justice in Zakonopravilo but the most significant one hails from the fourth introductory chapter. This chapter was taken from Saint John Chrysostom's interpretation of \\"Our father\\" and it goes like this: Because, he didn't say Mine father but Our father.... So nobody should ever worry only about themselves but also about their neighbours, and nobody should have more than the other: neither the rich from the poor, neither the lord from the servant, neither a prince from those upon he rules, neither a tsar from the soldier, neither the wisest from the unlearned, because to all he gave one gratitude.\\" This regulation proclaims the equality of all people regardless of their financial gain and their social status, it does not allow oppression and it strives for welfare. It is completely in the contrary to the principles that slave society made back then. =Shelter of the poor and the role of noble homes= Shelter of the poor and the role of noble homes is mentioned in the 48. chapter of Zakonopravilo in the section named ‚Äúabout court and justice‚Äù that was taken from the third and fifth book of Moses. What Sava wanted to emphasize with this section was philanthropy. He stresses out that more attention should be payed to laws than to words, and that laws should be interpreted in a way that encourages philanthropy. Shelter and assistance for the most endangered (the poor) was defined as ethical and just while looking up to rich and powerful was unethical and unacceptable. Some regulations of Zakonopravilo underline that people and institutions which are most likely to be asked to provide protection of the weak are bishops, deacons and prezbyters (basically the church as an institution). Zakonopravilo contains two canons which tell us more about this: -59. apostles‚Äô canon provides excommunication from the church for bishops or presbyters who won‚Äôt give a poor cleric what he‚Äôs in need for and taking away their rank if they remain merciless (because they are murderers of their own brother) -7. canon from Synod of Sardica includes not only the poor but also the ones who are unprotected from violence. Those can seek the help from bishop who is obliged to assist as much as he can or to go to tsar personally and ask him for help if it‚Äôs needed. The more population grew the more grew poverty. Since bishops had to perform their church duties they weren‚Äôt able to protect that many powerless people from abusers and famine. The solution was to establish services that the church representatives (ecdics) chosen by tsar would carry out. Ecdics were not only executors of the church but also judges in a way because it was expected of them to defend interests of the church even in the courtroom. However, some ecdics were responsible for more than only church questions. This is known from some tsar‚Äôs decrees, for instance: tsar Theodosius the First wrote to Constantinople's ecdic saying he shouldn‚Äôt let peasants and citizens be oppressed by taxes, that he should help repressing arrogance of archonts and should take care of his folk as of his children. Because of the importance of his role, participation of respectable citizens leaded by bishop and clergy in ecdic elections is regulated by law. Another mechanism of help and protection of the poor is mentioned in the second chapter of Zakonopravilo which was taken from Proheiron: \\"If the self-supporting man is involved in a lawsuit with his guardian, it is necessary he seeks help.\\" Proheiron also answers the question of who is considered to be poor-\\" the one who has less than 50 gold coins in his belongings is poor. One of the most important ways of protecting the poor and helpless is building the noble homes (churches, monasteries, hospices, public kitchens, residences of the impoverished, hospitals). Regulations referring to noble homes are mostly taken from John Sholasticus' Canon in 87 chapters or Justinian's Novellae. Here are some of them: -If the testator informs in writing that he has a wish of founding a noble home, a bishop or a head of that area is obliged to make that happen in a 5 year period and to do as the testator specified in his will (for instance if he selected the administrators he finds suitable). -Possessions inherited by the church are used for feeding the poor. -Those who ask to have back their possessions which were already designated for feeding the poor are never to be forgiven. Noble homes could have been leased but only under the strict surveillance so malpractice and damage inflication are avoided. Every damage just worsens the position of the poor. Lease could be granted for an unlimited period of time. At the same time, ways of making a lease contract were specified, for example by having administrative staff of the noble home swear an oath in front of a bishop promising there will be no damage caused. =Mutual responsibilities of parents and children= Mutual responsibilities of parents and children make another important section of Zakonopravilo that refers to the question of social justice. The author strived to highlight the importance of families, in which life evolves and social awareness awakens. He believed that respecting the parents is one of the greatest family values. This is why those who disrespect it and abuse their mothers or fathers are punished severely-with the death penalty. Proheiron prescribes a milder punishment-those who are guilty shall be disinherited. In case of sickness, children also have obligations to their parents. If parents are mentally or physically ill and their children refuse to look after them, then they, as legal heirs, could be disinherited. Children have one more obligation concerning inheritance law. They should not disinherit their parents or alienate their property which could be bequeathed- it is strictly forbidden in all but the following situations: when parents give up their children for execution, when parents practice witchcraft to harm their children, when the father seduces son‚Äôs wife or concubine or when parents endanger each other. Children who abandon their parents and excuse themselves with nothing but piety while showing no respect, will be doomed, and vice versa (for parents who abandon their children before adulthood). Certain civil regulations were influenced by these canon norms. Parents are not allowed to disinherit their children nor children to disinherit their parents when leaving for the monastery, if the motive for disinheriting appeared before the monastic life. Zakonopravilo also regulates the way property of those who enter the monastic life should be divided. If a monk has children, he can bequeath his property before or after leaving for the monastery so his children are provided with heritage. If he dies before making a will, children are to take what is their legally while the rest of the property is given to the monastery. Zaokonopravilo lays down the rules of inheritance for children whose father (if he did not live in the monastery) died and who now live with a poor mother or mother in law. In this case, if de cuius has three children or less the wife gets a quarter of the property, whether children are hers or from the previous marriage. If he has more than three children then the wife gets just as much as one child gets for use (owners of that property are their own children). =The old, the powerless and those with physical deformities= Saint Sava payed attention to the old, the powerless and to those with physical deformities too. Since ageing usually comes along with diseases, weakness, sadness...the author's aim was to provide respect and legal protection for this category of people. That is why in the chapter 48 of Zakonopravilo under the \\"about respecting the graybeards\\" heading there is to be found a regulation from the books of Moses: \\"Before the face of the gray-haired stand up and respect the face of the old.\\" Saint Sava wrote an interpretation of the whole canon, including Aristinos' comments, regarding this topic. He also added that: \\"If any Clergyman imitates or ridicules the blind, the deaf or the lame, or those crippled in any other way- he shall be deposed because he is an offense to God who created him.\\" Another way to protect these people was to give them a opportunity of inheritance. Besides this, the only way for their relatives to inherit them is to manage their property during lifetime. Also, the law dictates that the blind can name their own heir verbally, by having seven or five witnesses present. =The position of women= The position of women actually represents one of the most important indicators of social awareness in society. Roman marriage law enables a relatively easy divorce by written statement (labellum repudii) or by an agreement (divortum ex consensu). Byzantine marriage law had difficulty in freeing itself from its roman heritage, until tsar Justinian made important limitations to the novellae in 542. which were later transferred to Nomocanon in 14 titles (47th chapter of Zakonopravilo). With this law marital security of women was also strengthened in both families of priests and secular families. When it comes to families of priests, Zakonopavilo dictates that if a prezbyter or a deacon banishes his wife (for example by excusing himself with piety) and decides not to take her back, his title will be taken away. The rule in secular families is that if a man leaves his wife, for any reason other than the ones regulated by law, and weds another he will be denied holy communion, while a woman that leaves her husband will be cursed. The only legitimate reason for a divorce, according to canonical teaching, is adultery. Nevertheless, Saint Sava couldn‚Äôt stay within the boundaries of church teaching when it came to reasons for divorce. He prescribes part of a novella written by tsar Leo VI the Wise which states that if a man has an insane wife that doesn‚Äôt get better within 3 years, he has the right to divorce her. After that, in the 11th chapter of Proheiron is a list of reasons from which a woman can ask for a divorce: if the husband is working against the state or knows anyone else that might be without revealing it, if he does anything to harm the wife in any way, if he forces her to be unfaithful‚Ä¶ For a divorce to happen, in the case of the wife committing adultery, doubt alone is not enough but a proof is needed. If it is determined that the wife was in fact unfaithful, the husband gets the premarital gift and the dowry, but if its proven otherwise the woman can get a divorce and take her dowry and premarital gift back. If they had no children the woman also has the right to her husband‚Äôs possessions worth up to a third of the premarital gift. In the case of the husband being unfaithful, the woman can choose not to leave her husband if he stops living with another woman after his wife requests it. If a slave was involved in the adultery, the punishments are a little bit more rigorous: When the husband commits adultery with a slave the act will be revealed to the public, the husband will be punished by beating and the slave will be sold to another region. When a married woman commits adultery with her slave, she will get punished by beating, cutting her hair, cutting off her nose, banishing and confiscating her belongings and the slave is punished by the sword. The difference in punishment for men and women for the same act of deviancy is quite apparent. Nevertheless, there are situations in which they will be punished equally ‚Äì when a man puts the woman‚Äôs life at risk, or the other way around, the crime will be revealed to the public and an immediate retaliation is requested. According to the church, widows and poor women were the most socially endangered group so they were accordingly given the most protection. An article was carried over from The Second Book of Moses to Zakonopravilo stating:‚Äù You must not mistreat any widow or orphan. If you do mistreat them, and they cry out to Me in distress, I will surely hear their cry. My anger will be kindled, and I will kill you with the sword; then your wives will become widows and your children will be fatherless.‚Äù. The first way of protecting a widow is the inheritance she will get (if her deceased husband has up to three children), which is ¬º (one fourth) of the husband‚Äôs assets, which can not be over 100 liters of gold. The second way is that the church is obliged to feed and take care of the widow if she were to request it. Just like the widows, poor women were also protected. According to the book of tsar, a person that defamed a virgin will get their nose cut off and will be obliged to give a third of all their assets to the woman in question. Proheiron states that if a person were to have a relationship with a girl younger than 13, that person would have their nose cut off, and will be obliged to give half of all their assets to the girl in question. If a person were to abduct an engaged woman, they would be obliged to give her back to her fianc√©e, and if they were to abduct a woman that was not engaged, they would be obliged to give her back to her family (parents, guardians, brothers‚Ä¶), which would later decide if she was to marry her captor. This regulation was adopted in Synod of Ancyra. Saint Basil later made some significant changes to this regulation with the 22. cannon. However, the book of tsar and the Proheiron were not in agreement with the idea of a woman marrying her captor, they even strictly forbid it (according to the Proheiron, a parent that wishes his daughter marries her captor will be imprisoned). Civil legislation in the Proheiron states the following in the case of a person defiling a woman with her consent, but without the consent of her parents: If the woman is not engaged, the man who defiled her can marry her if he chooses to do so, but only with the consent of her parents. If the parents do not consent, and the man is wealthy, he is obliged to give the woman a liter of gold. If the man is poor, he is obliged to give the woman half of his property. If the man is disabled, he is to be beaten and banished. In the case of the woman being engaged there are two possibilities. If the woman consented the man will be punished by getting his nose cut off. If the woman did not consent, apart from getting his nose cut off, the man will also be obliged to give her a third of his property. In the case of poor women, Zakonoprailo protects them with the following articles: Marriage between a guardian (and his closest relatives) and a poor woman is forbidden, so that she can protect herself from being abused by the people in whose care she is. If moribund parents appoint a guardian for their daughter, he can not marry her off or abrogate a previous marriage without her consent. =Captives, exiles and prisoners= Prisoners were considered the most socially endangered of all because in exchange for their freedom even censers were allowed for sale. The importance of freeing prisoners is represented in one specific regulation that says that monks who, when leaving the monastery, ask to have their possessions back even though they were used to release prisoners, will never be forgiven. Anyone could bequeath their property to prisoners for the sake of their release. Prisoner‚Äôs heirs (especially children) are bound by the law to use the heritage in order to help the prisoner make free. If not, the church shall take away the property and use it with that purpose. If children are to neglect their imprisoned parents, and they manage to free themselves, they have the right to choose whether children will become a part of their will or not. If they fail to free themselves or die while in captivity because of their childrens‚Äô neglect, the children shall be disinherited and the property will be given to the church with the aim of paying ransom for others. The same is the case with relatives who are named as heirs. When a child is taken to captivity, parent‚Äôs obligations are not much different. Parents are disinherited if their child passes away in captivity because of their neglect. In the aim of releasing captives it was allowed for anyone (older than 18) to take gold as a loan and pawn his own or prisoner‚Äôs belongings. A male minor is not obliged to have a custodian if his father is held captive, but he needs to have a property guardian. After the father is released the son is back in his power. A woman could also be held in custody and if someone was to pay her ransom she would become his wife and their children would be legitimate.A dying soldier is also considered socially endangered. If a soldier realizes his end is near he can bequeath his property in front of two witnesses and his will be accepted as valid. Exiles and captives were also considered socially endangered. A woman could also sell her dowry in order to feed her exiled father, brother or husband. Those who were captivated temporarily did not lose their inheritance rights. =Slaves= Many regulations of Zakonopravilo represent a great contrast between the slave society and christian teaching. Christian teaching proclaims freedom and equality of all, including both slaves and masters. However, slavery was so deeply rooted that it took a couple of centuries for people to start perceiving slaves as more than things (res). Chapter 55 of Zakonopravilo (Prochiron) states that slavery is opposing to nature which made everyone free, but the need for wars created slavery since the law of war states that victors are to rule the losers. Also, a person is either born a slave or becomes a slave (in captivity) and all slaves are equal-nobody is more or less of a slave. On the one hand, slaves could be tortured by masters but on the other hand, the greatest punishment would ensue for the slave that tries to endanger his master‚Äôs life. A master could be convicted if he tortures his slave for a long time before killing him, but if he murders him without torture he will get away with no punishment. Two rules were taken from Moses‚Äô legislation: 1\\\\. A master who murders a slave by his own hand is to be punished 2\\\\. A slave has its monetary value Because of the second rule, it‚Äôs worse to hit a slave than to hit a freeman. Both master and slave benefit from this- master makes profit out of it and a slave is protected from injuries that would cause his price to drop. More favorable are church regulations. Masters are mentioned in a mindful way so their anger towards the slaves would be reduced, while slaves are not encouraged to rebel or slaughter. Instead they are asked to be loyal and serve their masters in order to make them more willing to grant freedom. Slaves could be named as priests only with their master‚Äôs consent and if it was given to them they would be set free. If it wasn‚Äôt, and if the slave decided to leave church and start living a worldly life, a master was allowed to regain power over him in a one year period. Master‚Äôs consent was necessary when a slave wanted to become a monk too. Those who encouraged slaves to leave their masters, excusing themselves with piety, would be convicted and the slaves who would, would be doomed. This regulation shows how careful and strict slave society was when it comes to releasing slaves, but also when it comes to protecting the real and pure significance of piety. For a very long time, freeing the slaves was possible only in tsar‚Äôs chambers until the Synod of Carthage where ‚Äûthe fathers of the synod‚Äú asked the tsar to allow the slaves to be freed in churches too. Next regulation with whom slaves were protected stated that when a master frees his slave before two witnesses, the slave can no longer be enslaved by anyone. Chapter 40. of Zakonopravilo is named \\"Chapters of the great church, Hagia Sophia, sealed up with Justinian‚Äôs golden stamp, about slaves who resort to church\\" and it contains six rules from which only one does not regard slaves. 1\\\\. If a freeman is enslaved and he turns to church, his master will be invited and if he doesn‚Äôt come than the slave will be freed. 2\\\\. If a master or someone else tortures the slave with hunger or nudity, and the master does nothing to stop it, the slave must be sold to somebody else so he wouldn‚Äôt die from hunger. 3\\\\. Not related to slaves. 4\\\\. If a slave resorts to church for no reason, he will be punished and returned to his master. 5\\\\. If a slave asked for the master to come and take him home himself, and the master sent a representative instead, in that way disobeying slave‚Äôs wishes, the church is obliged to handover the slave nevertheless (for instance- to lord‚Äôs most loyal servant). 6\\\\. Masters of slaves who escape to church should always be notified to come and take them since running away is offensive and it requires a punishment. One of the most important strides in establishing a more humane relationship towards slaves was to give them a possibility to become heirs. An heir could be their own slave, but they could also be someone else‚Äôs. The social status of slaves was also improving when it came to family law. A child conceived between a free mother and a slave father is free upon birth because his mother was free while giving birth, even if she was a slave when the child was conceived. It also goes the other way around, if the mother was a free woman when the child was conceived, but a slave while giving birth, the child will be a free person. In Alexius I Comnenus‚Äôs novella (46. chapter of Zakonopravilo) in the year 1095. slaves are no longer defined as things and their marriage is declared equal to marriage of free people. Until then, slaves would get married without a church ceremony, because their owners were afraid that would make their slaves in to free people. Tsar declared that the church ceremony should same for everyone, and that without it the marriage would be considered an obscenity. Alexius explained his decision by stating: ‚ÄúThere is one Lord for everyone, one faith, one baptism for both slave and master, but what is the difference in faith ‚Äì we do not know; therefore, all of us are slaves as well to the one that got us out of our slavery‚Äù. History During the Nemanjiƒá dynasty (1166‚Äì1371), the Serbian medieval state flourished in the spheres of politics, religion and culture. A large number of monasteries were built, far more than in previous centuries. The country was expanding between three seas and urban life became highly developed. Trade, mining and manufacturing were significantly expanded. Serbia and the Nemanjiƒá dynasty became well known and respected. The ruling family, despite becoming prosperous, was widely known for piety and religious dedication and was praised and celebrated by following generations. Formal establishment of a kingdom (1217) and religious independence (1219) came after extensive political efforts by Stefan Nemanja (founder of the dynasty) and his sons, Stefan Nemanjiƒá (first Serbian king) and Sava Nemanjiƒá (first Serbian archiepiscope). To create a lasting foundation for this independent state it was necessary to produce a legal system that established regulations for the Serbian kingdom and Serbian church. During this period, only the tsar could establish legal acts and laws, which would fill the gaps in common law. As the state developed, so did industry, and thus the legal system had to regulate various relations. Therefore, with the development of an economy, Roman Law was adopted. It is important to note that prior to the Nemanjiƒá era, Serbia was not ruled by a Tsar, so its ruler could not create a code of laws which would regulate the relations in the state and church. Serbian rulers reigned with single legal acts and decrees. In order to overcome this problem and organize the legal system after acquiring religious independence, Saint Sava finished his Zakonopravilo in 1219. Fresco of Saint Sava, Studenica Monastery Zakonopravilo is inseparably connected to gaining religious independence. Saint Sava most likely brought an already written nomocanon to Nicaea, when he went there in 1219. to request independence for the Serbian church from the Patriarch of Constantinople. It is hardly believable that Patriarch would have accepted the creation of Serbian independent church, before he had seen the nomocanon book that would regulate the functioning of the new church. After that, on his way back to Serbia, Saint Sava spent short time in Thessaloniki where he completed the nomocanon. It is most likely that he began the work on the Serbian nomocanon in 1208. while being at Mount Athos, using the Synopsis of Stefan the Efesian, Nomocanon of John Scholasticus, Nomocanon in 14 Titles, Ecumenical Councils' documents, which he modified with the canonical commentaries of Aristinos and John Zonaras, local church meetings, rules of the Holy Fathers, the law of Moses, translation of Prohiron and the Byzantine emperors's Novellae (most were taken from Justinian's Novellae). Zakonopravilo was a completely new compilation of civil and religious regulations, taken from Byzantine sources, but completed and reformed by Saint Sava in order to function properly in Serbia. Beside decrees that organized the life of church, there are various norms regarding civil life, most of them were taken from Proheiron., originally published in It consisted out of 70 chapters: 6 in the introduction, 44 dedicated to church law and 20 to civil law. Despite being based on byzantine codexes, Zakonopravilo contained Sava's own interpretations which increased its value. Saint Sava dedicated a great number of regulations to the protection of the poor and disempowered. He also accentuated the equality of state and church which lead to the acceptance of Symphonia, the orthodox theory which posits that church and state are to compliment each other. Multiple transcripts were preserved until this day: -The transcript of Ilovica dates back to 1262. It was written in the Monastery of Saint Archangel Michael (today the Monastery of Saint Archangels next to Tivat) where the headquarter of Ze bishopric was located. It consists out of 398 parchment pages and is today kept in the library of Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. -The transcript of Ra≈°ka became in the year 1305. in Peter‚Äôs church in Ras. It is written on parchment and it contains 427 pages. It is kept in the Museum of History in Moscow. -The transcript of Deƒçani was also written on parchment in the 1340. It has 284 pages and is kept in the library of Deƒçani Monastery. -The transcript of Pƒçinj dates back to 1370. Unlike the previous ones, it was written on paper. It has a leather bind and 305 pages. It is kept in the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts. -The transcript of Moraƒç became around the year of 1615. It consists out of 347 paper pages. It is kept in the Museum of Serbian Orthodox Church. -The transcripts of Sarajevo and Hilandar became in the XIV century. -The transcript of Belgrade became in the XV century. -The transcripts of Peƒá and Savina became in the XVI century. -The Canon of John Zlokruhoviƒá became in the XVII century. -The Nomocanon of Szentendre became in the XVII century. Legal transplants of Roman-Byzantine law became the basis of Serbian medieval law and Serbia became the part of European and Christian civilization. In the 13th century Zakonopravilo was transferred to Bulgaria and from there to Russia. It was printed in Moscow twice- in the 1650 and 1653, under the name of Krmƒçija but it was also reprinted during the 18th and 19th century. The last edition dates back to 1914. The first edition was found to be incorrect and the second one was printed in 1200 copies of which some reached the Serbs. Since the 17th century the Serbs have been using the Russian printed editions of Sava‚Äôs Zakonopravilo. The name Krmƒçija was also accepted from Russia and it alludes to church being steered by the nomocanon. Originally Zakonopravilo didn‚Äôt contain Zakon sudni ljudem and Sud cara Leona i Konstanina (Slavic alterations of Eclogue) but the printed version of Zakonopravilo does. So, Roman-Byzantine law was transplanting among East Europe through Zakonopravilo. In Serbia, it was considered as the code of the divine law and it was implemented into Du≈°an's code (1349 and 1354). It was the only code among Serbs in the time of the Ottoman reign. Sud Ivana Crnojeviƒáa The legislative tradition of Serbian folk is also to be seen in Montenegro. Just before the loss of their independence in the feudal age, between 1486 and 1490, a short codex was written. It consisted of only 7 articles and it is known as –¢he Verdict of Tsar and Patriarch (–°—É–¥ –¶–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –∏ –ü–∞—Ç—Ä–∏—ò–∞—Ä—à–∏—ò—Å–∫–∏) or The Verdict of Ivan Crnojeviƒá (–°—É–¥ –ò–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –¶—Ä–Ω–æ—ò–µ–≤–∏—õ–∞). It is based on the alteration of Du≈°an's code(–î—É—à–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω–∏–∫) from the fifteenth century. Around the beginning of the 19th century when Montenegro started developing characteristics of an independent country, Peter I made a Codex in 33 lines (–ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω–∏–∫ —É 33 –ø—É–Ω–∫—Ç–∞). Codex of Podunavlje Codex of Podunavlje was only a draft that never gained legal power. Nevertheless, it witnesses an eternal need of Serbs to arrange state relations legally. Serbs from Srednje Podunavlje used Krmƒçija as a source for their own codex. This codex had 27 articles which were not labeled by numbers in the manuscript. The labeling was done by Aleksandar Solovjev, who prepared the edition of the codex and wrote both juristical and historical comment on it, in the ‚ÄûGlas‚Äú (‚ÄûVoice‚Äú) of Serbian –êcademy of Sciences and Arts . In the sixteenth article it is mentioned that some parts of the codex were taken from Zakon sudnji ljudem, Zakon gradski (Proheiron) and Sud cara Leona i Konstanina (Eclogue). All of the laws above were already a part of Krmƒçija but articles have undergone minor or bigger alterations. It was written in folk language with an exception of some lines in church slavic. Pavle ≈†afarik got the hold of the manuscript soon before leaving Novi Sad in 1831. It is now kept in his manuscript collection in National Museum of Prague. Legacy During the Serbian Revolution (1804) priest Mateja Nenadoviƒá established Zakonopravilo as the code for the liberated Serbia. It was also implemented in Serbian civil code (1844). Zakonopravilo is still used in the: Russian, Bulgarian, and Serbian Orthodox Churches as the highest church code.

A blind person, he was credited with giving a vision of life to the people. He wrote 139 books on various subjects containing more than 6000 pages, 130 commentaries and about 25,000 stanza in poetry in his short life of 34 years.  Biography  Gulabrao Maharaj was born in a Maharashtrian Kunbi family on 6 July 1881 to Gonduji Mohod and Sou. Alokabai Mohod from the village of Madhan near Amravati. He became blind by being given the wrong medicine at the age of 9 months. When he was four years old his mother died, and he was brought up by his maternal grandmother in Loni Takli village. Shri Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj has given him Drushant when he was at the age of 19 years and given him mantra of his own name. After that Drushtant, the first ever photo picture of Sant Dhyaneshwar Maharaj Sant Dnyaneshwar has been drawn by an artist based on the directions of Maharaj. Even today, one can see the same photo-frame at the Samadhi Temple at Alandi, Maharashtra. Sant Gulabrao Maharaj was known as Pradnyachakshu Madhuradwaitacharya Gulabrao Maharaj. He was called Pradnyachakshu because he became blind of both the eyes at the age of about 9 months; still he was master of Vedanta philosophy and many occult and physical sciences. 'Pradnya' means intelligence and eyes are called \\"chakshu\\" in Sanskrit language. He had many divine powers which included the 'intellectual eyesight'. His mind could read and grasp any book in the world in any language that he would take in hand and decide to learn. His mind did not need the body-organ like 'eye' to see the world. \\"Madhuradwait\\" was the new school of thought introduced by him. The people well versed in Vedanta know that 'adwaita' (non-dualism) philosophy of Vedanta does not accept any name and form visible or non-visible that could be different from God (soul, Atma or Brahma). Vedanta very explicitly proclaims, \\"When everything has become one-soul, where is any other thing to smell ? who will see whom ? who will listen to whom ? who will talk to whom ? where is any other thing to think about ? who will know whom ? how to know him who knows everything ?\\" (Asy sarva atmaivabhuta, tat ken kam jighnet ? ken kam pashyet ?.. ... brihadaranyaka). \\"What exists is only one thing i.e. Brahma and what we see and experience as world is illusionary\\" is the teachings of \\"adwaita\\". Madhura Bhakti is the devotional love for lord Krishna. In Vedanta all the three words viz. devotee, devotion and deity are not different from each other where as in Madhura Bhakti one has to be a deity and other a devotee. Adwaita does not recognize Bhakti at all. Probably the great saint who possessed the eternal knowledge since childhood by dint of providence due to his past karma, had advocated Madhurabhakti for the \\"after-attaining- knowledge\\" stage to his disciple. His full name was Gulab Gundoji Mohod. He was born on July 6, 1881 in a small village named Madhan in Amravati district in Maharashtra and died merely at the age of 34 i.e. in the year 1915. Though he had lost his eyesight at the early age, he wrote about 133 books on various subjects containing more than 6000 pages, 130 commentaries and about 25,000 stanza in poetry. His mother died in the year 1885 when he was four years old. He then stayed at the house of his maternal grand mother at the place known as Loni Takli for about 6 years. In this period people came to know about his extraordinary intelligence and his \\"brain-sight\\" though he had lost his eye- sight. There was a community well in front of the house where he stayed and the women from the village would come to well for water. Small Gulab would call them all by their names, and the women would be wonderstruck and would think as to how the blind boy came to know about their individual names ? He was found many times in deep samadhi stage in the night. Initially his grand mother and others were frightened to see Gulabrao sitting in Yoga position with his respiration stopped completely. However, some elderly and wise men understood the conditions of Gulabrao and asked his relatives to refrain from disturbing him during samadhi. He very much liked the holy songs(Bhajans), holy verses (Slokas) and reading the occult books. He would ask his friends to read the books and would repeat the contents immediately as was heard by him. He had extraordinary memory. He knew all the Vedas and Shastras at the age of ten years. He was married to Mankarnika, daughter of Ganaji Bhuyar a farmer in nearby village in the year 1896. He started writing essays and poetry on the religious philosophy since 1897. i.e. from his age of sixteen. Since then he would visit the nearby cities, villages and towns and meet the people to discuss on the various topics of religion. This is incredible but true that in the year 1901 the great saint of 12th century Sant Dnyneshwar Maharaj met Gulabrao and accepted him as his disciple. Sant Gulabrao Maharaj would call himself to be wife of Lord Krishna and a daughter of Sant Dnyneshwara. He married to lord Krishna in the year 1905. He used to put on the dress and the ornaments like woman. He would lay kumkum ( a red spot) on his forehead and put on managalsutra ( a golden chain with black beads) around his neck which are usually worn by the Hindu married women. In the year 1902 when he was 21, he wrote the commentary on the theories of Darwin and Spencer. He had written books on various subjects like dhyan, yoga and bhakti and written commentaries on ancient treatises. He wrote on the \\"Manas Ayurveda\\", i.e. psychological part in the Ayurveda. He had given valuable guidelines to those who want to attain the salvation and gain the eternal knowledge. It is beyond one's imagination that a blind man could write on the subjects like Yoga, Upanishads and Brahmasutras and many occult sciences which are difficult subjects to understand even by the highly educated and intelligent persons. When did he find time to study these sciences ? How did he receive old treatises and from whom ? Who explained him the secret meanings of the Sanskrit verses ? Many questions like these arise in the mind when one reads his biography and the books written by him. His style of writing is of his own and he has put forth his own views absolutely keeping the Vedic discipline. He has boldly revealed many secrets of the Hindu religious sciences which are not generally made public by the saints. Though he was from the Kunbi caste, most of his disciples were Brahmin Pundits. He was openly telling people that he had no right to study the Vedas according to old traditions, but he knew Vedas without studying them and since he knew the \\"Atmadnyan\\" (knowledge of self- realization) he was not bound by many old rules. He used to respect Vedas, Brahmins and the guidance received from great wealth of old Indian religious treatises. He was straight forward and would defeat many Pundits and Intelligent people in the debate on the Shastras (sciences). It is generally found in India that the great persons who really had lived only for the cause of welfare of mankind were truly recognized by the people after their death only. Samartha Satguru Pradnychakshu Madhuradwaitacharya Saint Gulabrao Maharaj is becoming more and more popular after his Samadhi on 20 September 1915. His many disciples attained the knowledge of self-realization and are known in the public as the great saints. His main disciple, Baba Maharaj Pandit (death 1964) who wrote many books was recognized as a great intellectual, and saint. His commentary on \\"Bhavartha Deepika\\" written by Dnyaneshwara Maharaj is published by Geeta Press, Gorakhpur. The great saints like Gulabrao Maharaj guide the people even after their death by volumes of knowledge written by them. . Earlier life Sant Gulabrao Maharaj was none other than Swami Becharanand Maharaj in his earlier life/avatar (‡§ó‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ‡§¨‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ö‡•á ‡§ö‡§∞‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞) from Zinzuwada Gujrat 1765-1880 born in Sipur village 8 miles from Sidhapur (Matrugaya of today). He has done massive tap/dhyan for 12 years in a jungle near to Naleshwar temple by just having lemons as a food intake. Afterwards he has spent his further life at Rajasbai Mataji Temple Zinzuwada, Gujarat. How it was come to the notice has a detailed story, but will try to give a brief about it. Balavantrao Marathe originally based in Maharashtra was posted in Zhinzuwada from 1864-67 as a post master. He often used to visit Becharanand maharaj for seeking his blessings with his wife. Post retirement, he returned to his home in Amravati, Maharashtra and one day when he went to the famous Amba Devi temple there, touched the bells and chanted \\"Jai Jagdamb...\\", he heard some one referring him by his name \\"Who's there, Balvantrao Marathe?\\". Balavantrao looked amazed and went near to the person who has just called his name, he was none other than Gulabrao Maharaj. Maharaj said \\"Balavantrao, Looks like you've forgotten me\\" and letter told him \\"Some of the people from there (Zinzuwada) are also accompanied me today (In this life)!\\". After that day Balavantrao regularly used to visit at Gulabrao Maharaj place. Many times devotees insisted Balavantrao to reveal story about how he came to know about Maharaj but he tried to avoid it and letter on he has agreed and explained details about Becharanand Maharaj. Family tree The Mohod family of Madhan near Amravati originally migrated from a place near the Gujarat and Rajasthan state border in the 11th century. At the time, the family was known by the surname 'Modh' which later changed to 'Mohod'.

Within it lies Mount Archer National Park. It has been designated the Berserker Range Environmental Protection Area by the Rockhampton Regional Council. The southernmost part of the range reaches the Fitzroy River at Broadmount, east of Rockhampton. Geology The range is composed of a diverse group of mostly igneous rocks dating from the Devonian to Early Triassic Periods. It has its origins in the Early Permian period around 275 million years ago, when the original segment of continental crust stretched and subsequently sagged, leading to the development of two faults and subsequent volcanic activity. Much of the rocky outcrops and peaks of elevated areas are composed of masses of rhyolite and dacite and known as Elliott Rhyolite. These masses then erode, with the deposits forming a dark grey material known as Sleipner Member. Not all the elevated areas are rhyolite; Mount Dick and Mount MacDonald, are mainly composed of breccia. History Historically, the region was home to the Raki-warra clan of the local Darumbal indigenous people. It was named by Rockhampton pioneer pastoralist Charles Archer after the Norse warrior \\"Baresark\\", who fought without armour in the Norwegian sagas. Although born in Scotland, the Archer family lived for many years in Larvik, Norway and members of the family moved between Queensland and Norway throughout their lives. A small amount of gold mining took place in the 19th century, and grazing leases were issued in 1900. The area was declared a timber reserve in 1940 and logged, with ironbark, white mahogany and lemon- scented gum being the main trees harvested. Grazing ended in 1974 with the conclusion of the last lease, and logging ceased in 1985.

Biography  Yazdegerd I, who had strong relations with his father sent Mundhir his infant son Bahram Gur to be raise and educated in his court. After Yazdegerd's death, Persian nobles tried to reclaim Bahram from Mundhir, so Mundhir sent his son Nu'man with a brigade then he personally escorted Bahram another brigade of 20,000 soldiers to Ctesiphon where the nobles, after some negotiations, acknowledged Bahram as their ruler. Later the Byzantines were upset at the persecution of Christians in the Persian lands where Bahram killed a number of them and Mundhir in turn was for the persecution and converted back to his paganism, the Byzantines besieged Nisibis so Bahram along with Mundhir went to lift the siege.

These computing platforms can follow either a purely spatial computing model, as in field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or a temporal computing model, where a function is evaluated across multiple clock cycles. The latter approach aims at reducing the overhead of programmable interconnect in FPGA by folding interconnect resources inside a computing element. It uses dense two- dimensional memory arrays to store large multiple-input multiple-output LUTs. Computing with Memory differs from Computing in Memory or processor-in-memory (PIM) concepts, widely investigated in the context of integrating a processor and memory on the same chip to reduce memory latency and increase bandwidth. These architectures seek to reduce the distance the data travels between the processor and the memory. The Berkeley IRAM project is one notable contribution in the area of PIM architectures. Details Computing with memory platforms are typically used to provide the benefit of hardware reconfigurability. Reconfigurable computing platforms offer advantages in terms of reduced design cost, early time-to-market, rapid prototyping and easily customizable hardware systems. FPGAs present a popular reconfigurable computing platform for implementing digital circuits. They follow a purely spatial computing model. Since their inception in 1985, the basic structure of the FPGAs has continued to consist of two-dimensional array of Configurable Logic blocks (CLBs) and a programmable interconnect matrix.K.Compton and S. Hauck, \\"Computing: A Survey of systems and software\\", ACM Surveys, Vol. 34, No. 2, June, 2002. FPGA performance and power dissipation is largely dominated by the elaborate programmable interconnect (PI) architecture.S. M. Trimberger, Field Programmable Gate Array Technology, Norwell, MA: Kluwer, 1994.A. Rahman, S. Das, A. P. Chandrakasan, R. Reif, \\"Wiring Requirement and Three-Dimensional Integration Technology for Field Programmable Gate Arrays\\", IEEE Trans. on Very Large Scale Integration Systems, Vol. 11, No. 1, February, 2003. An effective way of reducing the impact of the PI architecture in FPGA is to place small LUTs in close proximity (referred as clusters) and to allow intra- cluster communication using local interconnects. Due to the benefits of a clustered FPGA architecture, major FPGA vendors have incorporated it in their commercial products.Xilinx CorporationAltera Corporation Investigations have also been made to reduce the overhead due to PI in fine-grained FPGAs by mapping larger multi-input multi-output LUTs to embedded memory blocks. Although it follows a similar spatial computing model, part of the logic functions are implemented using embedded memory blocks while the remaining part is realized using smaller LUTs.J. Cong and S. Xu, \\"Technology Mapping for FPGAs with Embedded Memory Blocks\\", Symposium on Field Programmable Gate Array, 1998. Such a heterogeneous mapping can improve the area and performance by reducing the contribution of programmable interconnects. Contrary to the purely spatial computing model of FPGA, a reconfigurable computing platform that employs a temporal computing model (or a combination of both temporal and spatial) has also been investigated S. Paul and S. Bhunia, \\"Reconfigurable Computing Using Content Addressable Memory for Improved Performance and Resource Usage\\", Design Automation Conference, 2008.S. Paul, S. Chatterjee, S. Mukhopadhyay and S. Bhunia, \\"Nanoscale Reconfigurable Computing Using Non- Volatile 2-D STTRAM Array\\", International Conference on Nanotechnology, 2009. in the context of improving performance and energy over conventional FPGA. These platforms, referred as Memory Based Computing (MBC), use dense two- dimensional memory array to store the LUTs. Such frameworks rely on breaking a complex function (f) into small sub-functions; representing the sub-functions as multi-input, multi-output LUTs in the memory array; and evaluating the function f over multiple cycles. MBC can leverage on the high density, low power and high performance advantages of nanoscale memory. Each computing element incorporates a two-dimensional memory array for storing LUTs, a small controller for sequencing evaluation of sub-functions and a set of temporary registers to hold the intermediate outputs from individual partitions. A fast, local routing framework inside each computing block generates the address for LUT access. Multiple such computing elements can be spatially connected using FPGA-like programmable interconnect architecture to enable mapping of large functions. The local time-multiplexed execution inside the computing elements can drastically reduce the requirement of programmable interconnects leading to large improvement in energy-delay product and better scalability of performance across technology generations. The memory array inside each computing element can be realized by content-addressable memory (CAM) to drastically reduce the memory requirement for certain applications.

Not only handling the export of primary products such as coal, iron ore, and manufactured agro and industrial products, MMTC also imports important commodities such as ferrous and nonferrous metals for industry, and agricultural fertilizers. MMTC's diverse trade activities cover Third Country Trade, Joint Ventures and Link Deals and all modern forms of international trading. The company has a vast international trade network, spanning almost in all countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, Oceania, America and also includes a wholly owned international subsidiary in Singapore, MTPL. It is one of the Miniratnas companies. MMTC is one of the two highest foreign exchange earner for India (after petroleum refining companies). Petroleum: India's largest foreign exchange earner. It is the largest international trading company of India and the first public sector enterprise to be accorded the status of Five Star Export Houses by Government of India for long standing contribution to exports Being the largest player in bullion trade, including retailing, MMTC's share was 146 tonnes of gold out of the total import of 600 tonnes of the precious metal in 2008‚Äì09. History=Foundation The company was incorporated on 26 September 1963 at New Delhi. The Corporation started functioning on 1 October. The main objectives of the company was export of mineral ores and import of essential metals. According to a latest news, MMTC is Asia's biggest gold and silver importer. MMTC: Asia‚Äôs biggest gold and silver importer-NEW DELHI (Commodity Online) State Trading Corporation After Independence the government decided to authorize the mining of scarce mineral resources to the public sector rather than private sector, although India's National Mineral Policy clearly states that it does not \\"preclude the State from securing the co-operation of private enterprise in the larger interest of the State or with a view to accelerating the pace of development\\" Under the Constitution of India, mineral rights and authority of mining laws remain vested with the state governments. On the other hand, Central government regulates the development of minerals under the Mines and Minerals (Regulation) Act of 1957. The MMTC has its origins in the 1950s, when the Indian government, with the interest of boosting agricultural and industrial development, determined to earn valuable foreign currency through the export of canalized mineral ores, which the country had huge deposits of. As a consequence of the government's decision to earn foreign currency, the State Trading Corporation of India Ltd. was founded in 1956, as a wholly owned government subsidiary, to handle the export and import of selected commodities. 1963-2000 The company had commenced its operation on 1 October 1963. With the rapid growth of the State Trading Corporation (STC) in its direct trading activities and in view of the importance given to the exports of mineral ores in the country's Five Year Plans, a decision was taken by the Government of India to split the STC and establish another corporation to deal exclusively with the trade in minerals and metals. Japan and South Korea continued to be the major markets till the year of 1994. Then it made a foray into European market with the exports of one lakh tonnes of iron ore to Slovakia and Romania. Also in the same year, the company had commenced import of gold and silver against special import license for supply to the customers in the domestic area. Imports worth 20 metric tonnes of gold and silver worth 270 tonnes was made and the company opened new gold vaults at Hyderabad and Vizag to offer its services to the customers in these areas. However, manganese ore exports remained depressed due to recession in the steel industry. The wholly owned subsidiary MMTC Transnational Pte Ltd, Singapore was incorporated under the control of company in the year 1994 itself. During the year 1995, MMTC opened a duty-free jewellery show room at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport and a Memorandum of understanding was signed with the government of Orissa for development of existing Gopalpur minor port into an all-weather, deep water and direct berthing port. In the same year, Board for Industrial & Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) had approved the scheme of merger-cum-amalgamation of Mica Trading Corporation of India Limited (MITCO) with MMTC.

From 1806 he held the title of Ban of Croatia. In the struggle against the First French Empire during Napoleonic Wars, he commanded army corps. At the time of his death, he presided over the Hofkriegsrat, the Austrian Council of War. While fighting against the Turks, Gyulay rose in rank to become a field officer. From 1793 to 1796, he served on the upper Rhine in combat with the armies of the First French Republic. In 1799 he led a brigade in Germany and the following year he commanded a division. From 1801 until 1831, he was Proprietor (Inhaber) of a Hungarian infantry regiment. During the Napoleonic Wars, Gyulay fought in the 1805 campaign against the First French Empire and later served his emperor as a negotiator in the peace talks. He commanded an Austrian army corps in the 1809 campaign in Italy. Again leading a corps, he fought at the decisive Battle of the Nations in 1813. During the subsequent French campaign in 1814, he led one of the corps in the victorious Allied armies. Early career Born in Nagyszeben (Hermannstadt) in the region of Transylvania in modern-day Sibiu, Romania on 11 September 1763, Gyulay was the oldest son of the Austrian Feldmarschallleutnant S√°muel Gyulay. In 1781 he joined his father's unit, the Gyulay Infantry Regiment # 32, as a F√§hnrich (cadet).German Wikipedia Ign√°cz Gyulay He fought in the Austro-Turkish War (1787‚Äì91), becoming a Major in the 2nd Banal Grenz Infantry Regiment # 70 on 25 March 1789. Within a year he earned promotion to Oberst-Leutnant and commanded a battalion of the Gyulay Freikorps. He led this unit in the storm of Cetin Castle on 20 July 1790.Smith-Kudrna, Ign√°c Gyulay French Revolutionary Wars=War of the First Coalition In 1793, the army assigned Gyulay to the Army of the Upper Rhine under the command of Dagobert von Wurmser. On 13 October that year, he led a brigade under Friedrich von Hotze in the First Battle of Wissembourg.Smith, p. 58. Smith incorrectly named him Albert Gyulay. In November, he held the village of Mertzwiller for three weeks in the face of French attacks during the Battle of Haguenau. This action earned him the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa in 1794. In 1793‚Äì94, his younger brother Albert Gyulay served in the Flanders Campaign. In 1794, Ign√°c Gyulay married Maria Freiin von Edelsheim (d. 1814).Smith- Kudrna, Ignaz Gyulai. This source gives Maria's birth year as 1740 which is not credible if she gave birth in 1798. It's probably a typo. Their son Ferencz Gyulai was born in 1798 and went on to become a high-ranking Austro- Hungarian general. Gyulay fought on the upper Rhine in 1794 and 1795. On 8 April 1795, he became Oberst (colonel) of the Benjowsky Infantry Regiment # 31. However, he continued to lead the Gyulay Freikorps. In 1796, he served under Michael von Fr√∂hlich in Maximilian Baillet de Latour's Army of the Upper Rhine. He fought at Renchen on 28 June and helped cover the subsequent retreat of the Imperial troops.Smith, p. 115. The Gyulay Freikorps fought at Renchen. Archduke Charles ordered him to command a force linking the Army of the Upper Rhine and Fr√∂hlich's corps. After the Battle of Ettlingen, Gyulay led Fr√∂hlich's rearguard, earning praise from his superior as a skillful commander of outposts. Later that fall, he greatly distinguished himself in action at Memmingen. For eight hours on 22 September, he held up the advance 6,000 French with only 1,200 soldiers. On 16 May 1797 he was elevated in rank to General-Major. War of the Second Coalition On 20‚Äì21 March 1799, Gyulay led a brigade in Friedrich Nauendorf's division at the Battle of Ostrach. He also fought at the First Battle of Stockach on 25 March. Soon afterward, he ambushed three battalions and four squadrons of French troops and chased them into Breisach. Battle of Hohenlinden The following year, Gyulay fought at the Second Battle of Stockach on 3 May 1800 and the Battle of Messkirch on 5 May. After the latter action, he led the rearguard and won a skirmish at G√ºnzburg on 24 May, taking 250 French prisoners. He captured 156 enemy troops in another skirmish at Krumbach on 11 June. These successes led to Gyulay being awarded the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa and promoted to Feldmarschallleutnant on 29 October. When the truce ended that fall, Gyulay found himself leading a division in Johann Riesch's corps, which was part of Archduke John's main army. He fought at the Battle of Ampfing on 1 December. Two days later at the Battle of Hohenlinden, Antoine Richepanse's division marched in front of Riesch's slow-moving left column to envelop the Austrian left-center column. Instead of attacking with crushing strength, Riesch erred by breaking up his two divisions into five small task forces while retaining three battalions and 17 squadrons in reserve. The corps commander then sent each task force along separate forest trails to attack the French.Arnold, p. 235. Gyulay fought well, but he had too few troops under his orders to influence the outcome of the battle, which ended in a decisive French victory. In April 1801, he became the proprietor of Ign√°c Gyulay Infantry Regiment # 60, a Hungarian unit formed in 1798. He held this post for 30 years until his death. Napoleonic Wars=War of the Third Coalition In 1805, Gyulay fought in the Ulm Campaign, commanding the Danube army's grenadier reserve in Franz von Werneck's corps. At the Battle of G√ºnzburg on 9 October he commanded a division of seven battalions and 14 squadrons. Ordered to rebuild a bridge across the Danube, he did so but was surprised when a French infantry regiment suddenly appeared and seized the span.Kagan, p. 409. Later, he escaped from Ulm with Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este and others.Schneid, p. 65. On 4 November, Gyulai served on a council of war convened by Emperor Francis II to determine how to save Vienna. Soon afterward, the emperor ordered him to negotiate secretly with Emperor Napoleon I of France.Rothenberg, pp. 96-97. On 25 November, Gyulay accompanied Johann Philipp Stadion, Count von Warthausen on a mission to negotiate a treaty with Emperor Napoleon I of France. During the talks Gyulay demanded that France compensate Austria for the loss of Venetia. A frustrated Napoleon wrote to Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord that Gyulay, \\"talked to me of the Teutonic Order, of the Diet in Ratisbonne, and I don't know what else\\". Though the discussions continued with Talleyrand, Napoleon became more focused on defeating his enemies and nothing came out of the peace talks.Kagan, pp. 560‚Äì561. After the disaster at the Battle of Austerlitz, at which Gyulay was not present, he and Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein negotiated the Peace of Pressburg with the First French Empire. Emperor Francis II appointed Gyulay the Ban of Croatia in 1806, a position he held throughout his lifetime. War of the Fifth Coalition Archduke John At the outset of the War of the Fifth Coalition, Gyulay led the IX Armeekorps in Archduke John's army in Italy. As originally organized, the corps consisted of three divisions under Franz Gorup von Bessanez, Christian Wolfskeel von Reichenberg, and Vinzenz Knesevich von Saint Helena. Gyulay commanded 22,290 infantry, 2,400 cavalry, and 86 artillery pieces.Bowden & Tarbox, pp. 107-109. The IX Armeekorps fought at the Battle of Sacile on 16 April 1809. During the fighting, the surprise intervention of the IX Armeekorps on the right flank was important in securing the Austrian victory over the Franco-Italian army of Eug√®ne de Beauharnais.Schneid, p. 74. His brother Albert led VIII Armeekorps in the same battle.Schneid, p. 64. When Emperor Napoleon defeated Archduke Charles at the Battle of Eckm√ºhl on the Danube, Archduke John was thrown on the defensive. The archduke assigned elements of Gyulay's corps to defend Dalmatia and other places. At the Battle of the Piave on 8 May, Gyulay led a considerably reduced IX Armeekorps of 12,720 men. As at Sacile, his brother Albert Gyulay led the VIII Armeekorps. Later, he defended Kranj in Carniola with 14,880 soldiers.Bowden & Tarbox, pp. 116-117. After Eug√®ne's army passed to the east in pursuit of Archduke John's army, Gyulay operated against Graz. On 25 June, his 22,000 troops attacked Jean-Baptiste Broussier's division which was besieging Graz. Broussier retreated into the hills and successfully defended himself until the arrival of Auguste Marmont's corps on the 27th. Gyulay was able to reprovision the Graz garrison before he withdrew.Schneid, p. 92. In the fighting, many of the hastily raised Austrian Landwehr and Hungarian insurrections militia fled the field. However, Gyulay's Austrian line infantry fought hard and suffered 164 dead and 816 wounded and captured. Reports of French casualties range from 263 to 900.Smith, p. 318. Smith writes that the fighting spanned 24 to 26 June. War of the Sixth Coalition When Austria entered the War of the Sixth Coalition, Gyulay was appointed commander of the Left Wing. His forces included the infantry divisions of Nikolaus Weissenwolf and Alois Liechtenstein, plus the mixed infantry-cavalry division of Karl Folliot de Crenneville. This organization fought at the Battle of Dresden on 26‚Äì27 August 1813, where it fought on the left flank and suffered serious losses.Millar, Dresden: Army of Bohemia Napoleon retreats after being defeated at the Battle of Leipzig. After a reorganization, Gyulay's formation became known as III Armeekorps, with each infantry division consisting of two, rather than three brigades. The new division commanders were Crenneville, Albrecht Murray de Melgum, and Prince Philipp of Hessen-Homburg. This was the organization used at the Battle of Leipzig on 16‚Äì19 October.OSG, Leipzig, p. 7. Before the battle, Gyulay's corps reached a position to the west of Napoleon's Grand Army, potentially cutting off the retreat of the French and their allies. On the 16th, he attacked the suburb of Lindenau and had success at first, forcing Marshal Michel Ney to divert Henri Gatien Bertrand's IV Corps to hold the position.Chandler, Campaigns, pp. 926-928. Without this important reinforcement, Napoleon's attacks on the main Austro-Russian army failed. On the 18th, Bertrand drove Gyulay away from Lindenau, clearing the way for Napoleon's retreat.Chandler, Campaigns, pp. 933-934. Gyulay continued to lead the III Armeekorps in the 1814 campaign. He fought at the Battle of La Rothi√®re on 1 February and defeated the French at the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube on 27 February. On 20‚Äì21 March, he led his corps in action at the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube. He participated in the Battle of Paris when the Allied armies captured the French capital, compelling Napoleon to abdicate in the Treaty of Fontainebleau on 11 April. He received numerous awards, including the Austrian Order of Leopold and the Military Honor Cross, the Russian Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle - 1st Class, and the Bavarian Military Order of Max Joseph. Later career From 1814 to 1823, Gyulay commanded the Banal Military Border with Turkey. He became proprietor of the 1st Banal Grenz Regiment # 10 and the 2nd Banal Grenz Regiment # 11 in 1823, and held these titles for the rest of his life. He was made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece and received the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary, both in 1830. He briefly sat as president of the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council) from 7 October 1830 until his death on 11 November 1831 in Vienna.

Social views regarding masturbation taboo have varied greatly in different cultures, and over history. Ancient history There are depictions of male and female masturbation in prehistoric rock paintings around the world. Most early people seem to have connected human sexuality with abundance in nature. A clay figurine of the 4th millennium BC from a temple site on the island of Malta, depicts a woman masturbating.\\"The ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim woman is... masturbating, with one hand languidly supporting her head. However, in the ancient world depictions of male masturbation are far more common. From the earliest records, the ancient Sumerians had very relaxed attitudes toward sex. The Sumerians widely believed that masturbation enhanced sexual potency, both for men and for women, and they frequently engaged in it, both alone and with their partners. Men would often use puru-oil, a special oil probably mixed with pulverized iron ore intended to enhance friction. Masturbation was also an act of creation and, in Sumerian mythology, the god Enki was believed to have created the Tigris and Euphrates rivers by masturbating and ejaculating into their empty riverbeds. Male masturbation was an even more important image in ancient Egypt: when performed by a god it could be considered a creative or magical act: the god Atum was believed to have created the universe by masturbating to ejaculation. Detail of a krater, dating to 560-550 BC, showing a satyr masturbating, a common scene in many ancient Greek pottery paintings The ancient Greeks also regarded masturbation as a normal and healthy substitute for other forms of sexual pleasure. Most information about masturbation in ancient Greece comes from surviving works of ancient Greek comedy and pottery. Masturbation is frequently referenced in the surviving comedies of Aristophanes, which are the most important sources of information on ancient Greek views on the subject. In ancient Greek pottery, satyrs are often depicted masturbating. According to the Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers by the third-century AD biographer Diogenes La√´rtius, Diogenes of Sinope, the fourth-century BC Cynic philosopher, often masturbated in public, which was considered scandalous.Examined Lives from Socrates to Nietzsche by James Miller pg:80 When people confronted him over this, he would say, \\"If only it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly.\\" Diogenes, speaking in jest, credited the god Hermes with its invention: he allegedly took pity on his son Pan, who was pining for Echo but unable to seduce her, and taught him the trick of masturbation in order to relieve his suffering. Pan in his turn taught the habit to young shepherds.Dio Crysostom, Discourses, iv.20 Masturbation is little noted in the sources for ancient Roman sexuality.Amy Richlin, \\"Sexuality in the Roman Empire,\\" in A Companion to the Roman Empire (Blackwell, 2006), p. 351. The poet Martial considers it an inferior form of sexual release resorted to by slaves.Though he admits to resorting to it: Martial, 2.43.14. See Craig A. Williams, Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 270; J.P. Sullivan, Martial, the Unexpected Classic: A Literary and Historical Study (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 190. Aulus Gellius, a Latin writer of the second century A.D., claims that the fragment of Empedocles \\"O wretches, utter wretches, from beans withhold your hands\\" refers to the testicles symbolically, trying too keep men away \\"from excess in venery\\". Though infrequently mentioned, masturbation was a longstanding theme in Latin satire, appearing in one of the few surviving fragments of Lucilius, Rome's earliest practitioner of the genre.At laeva lacrimas Muttoni absterget amica (\\"A girlfriend wipes away Mutto's (i.e., Dick's) tears\\" ‚Äî his left hand, his manus sinistra, because the right hand should be reserved for eating): Lucilius 307 and 959. Kirk Freundenburg has dubbed the Mutt≈ç of Lucilius \\"clearly the least finicky of all personified penises in Roman satire\\": Satires of Rome: Threatening Poses from Lucilius to Juvenal (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 205. The Romans preferred the left hand for masturbation.Antonio Varone, Erotica pompeiana: Love Inscriptions on the Walls of Pompeii (\\"L'Erma\\" di Bretschneider, 2002), p. 95; CIL 4.2066, as cited by John G. Younger, Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z (Routledge, 2005), p. 108. Cultures without masturbation Within the African Congo Basin, the Aka and Ngandu ethnic groups all lack a word for masturbation in their languages and are confused by the concept of masturbation. Health concerns=Insanity Several medical papers were written on insanity as a result of masturbation, and this was written as a reason for admission when a person was confined in a hospital. A doctor named J W Robertson tried to describe the differences between different types of masturbation in the year 1898, when addressing the Medical Society of the State of California.\\"Parental Kidnapping in America: An Historical and Cultural Analysis\\" by Maureen Dabbagh. Page 36. Published November 30, 2011. 18th century pamphlet The first use of the word \\"onanism\\" to consistently and specifically refer to masturbation is a pamphlet first distributed in London in 1716, titled \\"Onania, or the Heinous Sin of self-Pollution, And All Its Frightful Consequences, In Both Sexes, Considered: With Spiritual and Physical Advice To Those Who Have Already Injured Themselves By This Abominable Practice.\\" It drew on familiar themes of sin and vice, this time in particular against the \\"heinous sin\\" of \\"self- pollution\\", with dire warnings that those who so indulged would suffer: > Disturbances of the stomach and digestion, loss of appetite or ravenous > hunger, vomiting, nausea, weakening of the organs of breathing, coughing, > hoarseness, paralysis, weakening of the organ of generation to the point of > impotence, lack of libido, back pain, disorders of the eye and ear, total > diminution of bodily powers, paleness, thinness, pimples on the face, > decline of intellectual powers, loss of memory, attacks of rage, madness, > idiocy, epilepsy, fever and finally suicide. Included were letters and testimonials supposedly from young men ill and dying from the effects of compulsive masturbation. The pamphlet then goes on to recommend as an effective remedy a \\"Strengthening Tincture\\" at 10 shillings a bottle and a \\"Prolific Powder\\" at 12 shillings a bag, available from a local shop. \\"Onania\\" was a huge success with over 60 editions published and being translated into several languages. James In 1743‚Äì45, the British physician Robert James published A Medicinal Dictionary, in which he described masturbation as being \\"productive of the most deplorable and generally incurable disorders\\" and stated that \\"there is perhaps no sin productive of so many hideous consequences\\".Stengers, Jean; van Neck, Anne. Masturbation: the history of a great terror. New York: Palgrave, 2001. pp. 56‚Äì57. . Tissot 1785 Italian edition of Samuel Auguste Andr√© David Tissot's book: Treatise on the Diseases Produced by Onanism. One of the many horrified by the descriptions of malady in Onania was the notable Swiss physician Samuel- Auguste Tissot. In 1760, he published L'Onanisme, his own comprehensive medical treatise on the purported ill-effects of masturbation. Citing case studies of young male masturbators amongst his patients in Lausanne, Switzerland as basis for his reasoning, Tissot argued that semen was an \\"essential oil\\" and \\"stimulus\\", the loss of which in great amounts would cause \\"a perceptible reduction of strength, of memory and even of reason; blurred vision, all the nervous disorders, all types of gout and rheumatism, weakening of the organs of generation, blood in the urine, disturbance of the appetite, headaches and a great number of other disorders.\\" In a 17th-century law code for the Puritan colony of New Haven, Connecticut, blasphemers, homosexuals and masturbators were eligible for the death penalty. The context is a discussion of the social habits of the early North American colonists. Though Tissot's ideas are now considered conjectural at best, his treatise was presented as a scholarly, scientific work in a time when experimental physiology was practically nonexistent. The authority with which the work was subsequently treated ‚Äì Tissot's arguments were even acknowledged and echoed by luminaries such as Kant and Voltaire ‚Äì arguably turned the perception of masturbation in Western medicine over the next two centuries into that of a debilitating illness. Rush In 1812 Benjamin Rush included \\"Of the Morbid State of the Sexual Appetite\\" as chapter 18 of his book on diseases of the mind.Benjamin Rush (1812) Medical Inquires and Observations upon the Diseases of the Mind , page 347, link from Dickinson College In it he cites excessive eating, intemperance in drinking, and idleness as causative factors of onanism. Earlier in the book (page 33) he claims there is a \\"train of physical and moral evils which this solitary vice fixes upon the body and mind.\\" In his charge of mentally ill people he notes three driven to mania by onanism (page 48). In his observation of \\"congenital idiotism\\" (page 292) he notes, \\"The venereal appetite exists in them with great force, and they gratify it after puberty by onanism.\\" By 1838 Jean Esquirol declared in his Des Maladies Mentales that masturbation was \\"recognized in all countries as a cause of insanity.\\"E.H. Hare (1962) Masturbatory Insanity: The History of an Idea, Journal of Mental Science 108:4 (issue #452)William Dufty (1975) Sugar Blues, pages 65,6  White  In the 1870 book A Solemn Appeal Relative to Solitary Vice, and the Abuses and Excesses of the Marriage Relation, edited by James Springer White, husband of Ellen G. White, we find: > If the practice [of self-indulgence] is continued from the age of fifteen > and upward, nature will protest against the abuse he has suffered, and > continues to suffer, and will make them pay the penalty for the > transgression of his laws, especially from the ages of thirty to forty-five, > by numerous pains in the system, and various diseases, such as affection of > the liver and lungs, neuralgia, rheumatism, affection of the spine, diseased > kidneys, and cancerous humors.

Kellogg Doctor John Harvey Kellogg (February 26, 1852 ‚Äì December 14, 1943) was an especially zealous campaigner against masturbation. Kellogg was able to draw upon many medical sources' claims such as \\"neither the plague, nor war, nor small-pox, nor similar diseases, have produced results so disastrous to humanity as the pernicious habit of onanism,\\" credited to one Dr. Adam Clarke. Kellogg strongly warned against the habit in his own words, claiming of masturbation-related deaths \\"such a victim literally dies by his own hand,\\" among other condemnations. Kellogg believed the practice of \\"solitary-vice\\" caused cancer of the womb, urinary diseases, nocturnal emissions, impotence, epilepsy, insanity, and mental and physical debility ‚Äì \\"dimness of vision\\" was only briefly mentioned. In Plain Facts for Old and Young, Kellogg issued a warning on the evils of sex. Of the 644 pages, 97 address \\"Secret Vice (Solitary Vice or Self-Abuse)\\", its symptoms and results. Included are 39 signs indicating someone is masturbating. He recommended, to cure children from this \\"solitary vice\\", bandaging or tying their hands, covering their genitals with patented cages, sewing the foreskin shut and electrical shock, and circumcision without anesthesia, which would break the habit. In order to prevent it, he advised parents first to teach children to avoid handling their genitalia, and as they get more mature, to inform them \\"of the evil consequences\\". He also warned parents against \\"evil associations\\", servants, and \\"wicked or ignorant\\" nurses who would masturbate children in order to quiet them. Freud Sigmund Freud wrote of the \\"disease of masturbation\\": \\"He was suffering from the effects of masturbation.\\"\\"Delphi Collected Works of Sigmund Freud\\" Sigmund Freud. bin Baz In the 1990s, Abd al-Aziz bin Baz, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, argued masturbation causes disruption of the digestive system, inflammation of the testicles, damage to the spine, \\"trembling and instability in some parts of the body like the feet\\", weakening of the \\"cerebral glands\\" leading to decreased intellect and even \\"mental disorders and insanity\\". Moral concerns Immanuel Kant regarded masturbation as a violation of the moral law. In the Metaphysics of Morals (1797) he made the a posteriori argument that 'such an unnatural use of one's sexual attributes' strikes 'everyone upon his thinking of it' as 'a violation of one's duty to himself', and suggested that it was regarded as immoral even to give it its proper name (unlike the case of the similarly undutiful act of suicide). He went on, however, to acknowledge that 'it is not so easy to produce a rational demonstration of the inadmissibility of that unnatural use', but ultimately concluded that its immorality lay in the fact that 'a man gives up his personality ‚Ä¶ when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive'. The 18th- century philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau saw masturbation as equal to 'mental rape', and discussed it in both √âmile and Confessions. He argued that it was the corrupting influence of society that led to such unnatural acts as masturbation and that humans living a simple life amidst nature would never do such things. This continued well into the Victorian Era, where such medical censure of masturbation was in line with the widespread social conservatism and opposition to open sexual behavior common at the time.Stengers and van Neck. Masturbation. In 1879, Mark Twain wrote a speech titled Some Thoughts on the Science of Onanism which he ended with the words: There were recommendations to have boys' trousers constructed so that the genitals could not be touched through the pockets, for schoolchildren to be seated at special desks to prevent their crossing their legs in class and for girls to be forbidden from riding horses and bicycles because the sensations these activities produce were considered too similar to masturbation. Boys and young men who nevertheless continued to indulge in the practice were branded as \\"weak-minded.\\"Surgical Appliance Many \\"remedies\\" were devised, including eating a bland, meatless diet. This approach was promoted by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (inventor of corn flakes) and Rev. Sylvester Graham (inventor of Graham crackers). The medical literature of the times describes procedures for electric shock treatment, infibulation, restraining devices like chastity belts and straitjackets, cauterization or ‚Äì as a last resort ‚Äì wholesale surgical excision of the genitals. Routine neonatal circumcision was widely adopted in the United States and the UK at least partly because of its believed preventive effect against masturbation (see also History of male circumcision). In later decades, the more drastic of these measures were increasingly replaced with psychological techniques, such as warnings that masturbation led to blindness, hairy hands or stunted growth. Some of these persist as myths even today. Referring to such viewpoints and treatments, Messer and Walker stated: \\"These are some of the darkest pages of religious and medical history.\\" Note: Messer's and Walker's article cannot be protected by copyright. Image of a chastity belt from a patent document. For entire document, see: Page 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 As taboo In 1905, Sigmund Freud addressed masturbation in his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality and associated it with addictive substances. He described the masturbation of infants at the period when the infant is nursing, at four years of age, and at puberty. In 1910, the meetings of the Vienna psychoanalytic circle discussed the moral or health effects of masturbation but its publication was suppressed. Medical attitudes toward masturbation began to change at the beginning of the 20th century when H. Havelock Ellis, in his seminal 1897 work Studies in the Psychology of Sex, questioned Tissot's premises, cheerfully named famous men of the era who masturbated and then set out to disprove (with the work of more recent physicians) each of the claimed diseases of which masturbation was purportedly the cause. \\"We reach the conclusion\\", he wrote, \\"that in the case of moderate masturbation in healthy, well-born individuals, no seriously pernicious results necessarily follow.\\" Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of The Scout Association, incorporated a passage in the 1914 edition of Scouting for Boys warning against the dangers of masturbation. This passage stated that the individual should run away from the temptation by performing physical activity which was supposed to tire the individual so that masturbation could not be performed. By 1930, however, Dr. F. W. W. Griffin, editor of The Scouter, had written in a book for Rover Scouts that the temptation to masturbate was \\"a quite natural stage of development\\" and, citing Ellis' work, held that \\"the effort to achieve complete abstinence was a very serious error.\\" \\"Concerning Specific Forms of Masturbation\\" is a 1922 essay by Austrian psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich. In the seven and a half page essay Reich accepts the prevalent notions on the roles of unconscious fantasy and the subsequent emerging guilt feelings which he saw as originating from the act itself. Sexual revolution The works of sexologist Alfred Kinsey during the 1940s and 1950s, most notably the Kinsey Reports, insisted that masturbation was an instinctive behaviour for both males and females, citing the results of Gallup Poll surveys indicating how common it was in the United States. Some critics of this theory held that his research was biased and that the Gallup Poll method was redundant for defining \\"natural behavior\\". In the US masturbation has not been a diagnosable condition since DSM II (1968). The American Medical Association consensually declared masturbation as normal in 1972. Thomas Szasz states the shift in scientific consensus apud Ornella Moscucci, \\"Male masturbation and the offending prepuce,\\" at: (It is an excerpt from \\"Sexualities in Victorian Britain.\\") apud Masturbation: Current medical opinions Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance. New URL: http://sites.google.com/site/completebaby/repression as \\"Masturbation: the primary sexual activity of mankind. In the nineteenth century it was a disease; in the twentieth, it's a cure.\\" In the 1980s Michel Foucault was arguing masturbation taboo was \\"rape by the parents of the sexual activity of their children\\": > To intervene in this personal, secret activity, which masturbation was, does > not represent something neutral for the parents. It is not only a matter of > power, or authority, or ethics; it's also a pleasure. In 1994, when the Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. Joycelyn Elders, mentioned as an aside that it should be mentioned in school curricula that masturbation was safe and healthy, she was forced to resign, with opponents asserting that she was promoting the teaching of how to masturbate.

His tiebreaking vote in committee gave Ohio permanent daylight saving time. In 1970, Bowen was up for reelection, and O'Shaughnessy opted for a rematch. However, this time, Bowen was defeated, limiting his time as a legislator to one term, or four years.

She served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta twice the first time being from 1940 to 1955 and the second time being from 1959 to 1967. She sat with the governing Social Credit party and later as an Independent. She was married to Russell Wood. She was originally a teacher, then a leader at the local Women's Institute, chair of the local school board and mayor of Stony Plain. Political career Wood ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature for the first time in the 1940 Alberta general election. She defeated three other candidates in a hotly contested race on the third count to hold the Stony Plain electoral district for the Social Credit party. She ran for a second term in office in the 1944 Alberta general election and won a landslide against Co-operative Commonwealth candidate Harold Anderson in a straight fight. Wood would run for a third term in the 1948 Alberta general election. She faced Anderson for the second election and a liberal candidate. She won re-election cleanly with just over 50% of the popular vote. Wood would stand for a fourth term in office in the 1952 Alberta general election. Her popular vote fell just enough to force a second count. She won re-election after the ballot transfers from Liberal candidate Charles Wudel gave her a large majority. Wood was defeated standing for a fifth term in office in the 1955 Alberta general election. Liberal candidate John McLaughlin doubled his party percentage surging to a first ballot win with Wood finishing a close second. McLaughlin and Wood faced each other for the second time in the 1959 Alberta general election. This time McLaughlin ended losing almost 20% of his popular vote from the previous election and being defeated. Wood would be re-elected to her fifth term and second stint in office with just under half the popular vote. A rematch between Wood and McLaughlin took place for the third time in the 1963 general election. Both candidates lost about 4% of their vote in the five-way race with Wood hanging onto her seat and McLaughlin finishing second. Future MLA Rudolph Zander also ran in this race finishing a distant fourth place. Wood stood for a seventh term in office, however the Social Credit Stony Plain constituency association was looking for a change. On February 11, 1967 Wood was defeated by Ralph Jespersen in a nomination battle. Wood left the Social Credit caucus on April 24, 1967 claiming that she was the only true Social Creditor left and that was perhaps the reason for getting rid of her.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 17, 2010, and on Comedy Central UK on March 19, 2010. The title of the episode is derived from the song of the same name by soul singer Marvin Gaye. In the episode, the sex scandal of golf pro Tiger Woods has the media and public frantic to determine why rich and successful men would suddenly crave sex with multiple partners. Meanwhile, schools are screened for the condition and Kyle, Kenny and Butters are diagnosed with sexual addiction. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. \\"Sexual Healing\\" parodies several elements of the Woods scandal, including alleged fights with his wife Elin Nordegren, which are portrayed as part of a new Tiger Woods PGA Tour video game played by Cartman, Stan, and Kenny. In addition to mocking Woods himself, the script parodied the large amount of media attention surrounding the scandal, and suggested because it is natural for men to crave sex, Woods's actions can be understood, although not condoned. Cartoon parodies of several celebrities who have experienced real- life sexual scandals were featured in the episode, including Bill Clinton, David Letterman, Charlie Sheen, David Duchovny and Ben Roethlisberger. The treatment these celebrities received is portrayed as ineffective and ridiculous, suggesting celebrities should not have to undergo insincere acts of public apology for their sexual transgressions. \\"Sexual Healing\\" received generally mixed reviews from critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Sexual Healing\\" was seen by 3.7 million households, making it the most watched South Park premiere since \\"Rainforest Shmainforest\\" in 1999, and helping make March 17 the most-watched night of the year for Comedy Central to that point. Shortly after the episode aired, Internet rumors spread that EA Sports planned to sue South Park creators Parker and Matt Stone over their portrayal in the episode. EA Sports specifically denied the claims.  Plot  The new edition of the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games incorporates elements of the alleged physical altercations Woods had with his wife regarding his extramarital affairs, and resembles a fighting game more than a golf simulation. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny become big fans of the game. Meanwhile, scientists at the Center for Disease Control determine that sex addiction is a disease reaching epidemic proportions. They decide to screen schoolchildren for the disease, and Kenny, Kyle, and Butters are diagnosed as sex addicts. Kenny is killed after attempting autoerotic asphyxiation while in a Batman suit, while Kyle and Butters are sent to attend a therapy session for sex addicts consisting of Michael Douglas, Michael Jordan, Ben Roethlisberger, David Duchovny, Charlie Sheen, David Letterman, Bill Clinton, Billy Bob Thornton, Kobe Bryant, Eliot Spitzer, and Tiger Woods. When performing an experiment on chimpanzees, the CDC determines that money is somehow responsible for infecting males with sexual addiction. Because an image of Independence Hall appears on the back of a $100 bill, they believe the origins of the disorder can somehow be traced there. They submit their findings to President Barack Obama, who believes that a virus for sex addiction had previously been brought to Earth by extraterrestrials. He accompanies a SWAT team on their raid on Independence Hall in search of the \\"wizard alien\\" that is responsible for the sex addiction epidemic. When one member of the team suggests that the mission is irrational and that sex addiction is simply an inherent part of the male ego, he is ordered by Obama to be hauled away. Because Kyle also feels sex addiction is not a disease, but rather a natural male desire that can be kept under control with the proper discipline, others suggest he is somehow immune from the \\"spell\\" of the wizard alien. He is brought to Independence Hall along with Butters and both are given rifles by the SWAT team. The hauled-off SWAT member, gagged and bound in an alien wizard costume, stumbles into the room. On orders from the SWAT team, Kyle and Butters shoot the costumed officer dead and the \\"spell\\" is suddenly lifted. Woods announces he is cured of his sex addiction, and the next incarnation of his video game once again focuses on golf. Cartman and Stan reject the new game, with Stan proclaiming that \\"golf is stupid again.\\" Production and themes \\"Sexual Healing\\" parodied the sex scandal surrounding golf pro Tiger Woods and satirized the media attention it generated \\"Sexual Healing\\", the South Park fourteenth season premiere, was written and directed by series co- founder Trey Parker and was rated TV-MA-L in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 17, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on March 19. A teaser clip of the episode called \\"All the Temptations\\" featuring a parody of Woods's February 2010 televised public apology was featured on the official South Park website, South Park Studios, and drew 62,000 viewers on the first day. Before the episode aired, several news outlets incorrectly reported the episode's title was \\"All the Temptations\\" due to the clip. The episode satirized the sex scandal surrounding golf pro Tiger Woods, who had admitted to cheating on his wife Elin Nordegren with multiple partners. The Woods scandal had been one of the biggest media stories in the months since South Park's thirteenth season ended in November 2009. Series co-creator Matt Stone said the scandal provided so much material for satire that an entire season could have been dedicated to it, and the media storm surrounding Woods meant they had even less to worry about the delicacy of their parody. Stone said he was simultaneously fascinated and disgusted by Woods's public apology, so the writers were sure to include it in the episode. The script to \\"Sexual Healing\\" was not finished until after March 12, five days before the episode aired. This was in keeping with a continued practice from previous South Park seasons, in which Parker and Stone write and produce their episodes within the week before their broadcast dates in order to harness energy for the final product and keep the material fresh. In an early image of the episode released to the press, Woods is seen at his apology press conference, with Cartman standing beside him. During the production of the episode, the writers decided to incorporate the Tiger Woods scenes as part of the video game that the boys, including Cartman, are playing. \\"Sexual Healing\\" parodied several real-life elements of the scandal, including Nordegren's discovery of Woods's infidelity by reading text messages on his cellular phone, and Woods's loss of commercial endorsements as a result of his infidelity. The episode also parodies the alleged fight that was reported between Woods and Nordegren on Thanksgiving in which Nordegren attacked Woods's car with a golf club and caused him to crash into a fire hydrant. \\"Sexual Healing\\" also included a version of the public apology Woods delivered on February 2010, which was closely covered and examined by the mainstream media. The episode aired only a few days after Woods publicly announced he would return to golf at the 2010 Masters Tournament in April. The shock and confusion with which the male characters in \\"Sexual Healing\\" react to the Woods scandal, and the extreme measures they undertake to learn why rich and successful men crave sex, served as a parody to the wide media attention and analysis the scandal received. The episode puts forward a pragmatic explanation that it is natural for men to crave sex, so although Woods's actions cannot be condoned, they can at least be understood for what they are. This point of view particularly conveyed in the speech of one SWAT team member near the end of the episode, who is ostracized, imprisoned and unknowingly shot to death by Kyle and Butters after expressing his common sense views. The episode suggests men of normal financial means would likely be tempted by infidelity and sexual affairs if they had enough fame and money to obtain them easily. \\"Sexual Healing\\" suggests celebrities involved in sexual scandals should not be forced to undergo rehabilitation and public acts of contrition. The scene in which the celebrities start shaking and dancing, proclaiming \\"Look, the sex addiction is leaving my body!\\", demonstrates the insincerity and ridiculousness of these public steps. The episode also mocked the measures used to diagnose and treat sexual addiction in the United States. This is particularly prevalent when Kenny, Kyle and Butters are misdiagnosed with sexual addiction based on an inaccurate test of simply presenting an image of a naked woman to them and testing whether they could identify a handkerchief in the woman's hand and specify its color. The rehabilitation courses themselves are also mocked as ineffective and unnecessary, particularly because the most important lesson taught in them is how to avoid getting caught. Current affairs references Several celebrities who had experienced well publicized sexual scandals or affairs were featured in a sexual addiction rehabilitation class \\"Sexual Healing\\". Among them were former U.S. President Bill Clinton, night talk show host David Letterman, NFL quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, basketball players Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, and actors Charlie Sheen, David Duchovny, Michael Douglas and Billy Bob Thornton. While discussing how to avoid getting caught, Roethlisberger says, \\"Don't screw girls in the public bathrooms\\", a reference to his March 2010 sex scandal in Milledgeville, Georgia. Clinton suggests not putting cigars into any woman's vagina, a reference to his alleged sexual act with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky during the Lewinsky scandal. David Letterman says, \\"When they ask you for money, pay them\\", a reference to the October 2009 scandal in which CBS producer Joe Halderman attempted to blackmail Letterman with information about his sexual affairs. When a doctor explains auto-erotic asphyxiation to Kenny, Kyle and Butters, he refers to the deaths of actor David Carradine and INXS singer Michael Hutchence. After it is explained to Kenny that auto-erotic asphyxiation often involves wearing a costume of some type, he dons a costume of Batman, the DC Comics fictional superhero, and subsequently dies in the outfit. The title of the episode is derived from the song of the same name by soul singer Marvin Gaye. A version of the song, sung by series co-creator Trey Parker, is featured at the end of the episode, when the celebrities claim the sexual addiction has left their bodies. The angry and violent confrontations between Woods and Nordegren are portrayed not as reality within the episode, but as simulated elements of the newest Tiger Woods PGA Tour video game installment by EA Sports. Scientists from the Center for Disease Control, a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, conduct experiments on chimpanzees in \\"Sexual Healing\\" to discover why celebrities crave sex with multiple women. The ending where President Obama is addressing a crowd at the United States Capitol is a reference to the ending of Deep Impact. Reception In its original American broadcast on March 17, 2010, \\"Sexual Healing\\" was watched by 3.7 million viewers, according to the Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched South Park debut since the third season premiere \\"Rainforest Shmainforest\\" in 1999. The day it aired, \\"Sexual Healing\\" was the highest-rated show in all of television among men between ages 18 and 34, and was the highest rated cable show among adults between ages 18 and 49. March 17 ranked as the most-watched night of the year for Comedy Central. \\"Sexual Healing\\" drew a 2.6 overall rating, a 2.4 rating among adults between ages 18 and 49, a 5.2 rating among men between ages 18 and 34, and a 6.9 rating among men between ages 18 and 24. \\"Sexual Healing\\" aired before the series premiere of the animated comedy series Ugly Americans, which drew 2.1 million viewers. The network was also the highest-rated and most-watched overall television network among men between ages 18 and 24, and the highest- rated and most-watched cable network among adults between ages 18 and 49 and men between ages 18 and 34. \\"Sexual Healing\\" received generally mixed reviews. Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun praised the timeliness of the episode, which he said has kept South Park relevant throughout its 14 seasons. Harris complimented the episode for addressing the larger issue of how sexual acts among celebrities are dissected and analyzed by the media and public. MTV News praised the Woods parody, which they said was particularly timely because of the golf pro's recent announcement to return to golf. It said, \\"It was on-the- nose while still being clever, which is a balance that the makers of \\"South Park\\" have mastered brilliantly.\\" Bill Brownstein, from the Canwest News Service, called it \\"an absolutely blistering and timely satire\\" on Woods and sexual addiction. A CNN review called the Woods satire \\"brilliant\\" and a strong improvement over the previous season's \\"Dead Celebrities\\", which also included several cameos of celebrity parodies. The review also found the ending of the episode, with Stan and Cartman growing bored with their video game once it focused on golf rather than sex scandals and fighting, to be a \\"pretty hilarious gag\\". Ryan Waxon, of The Cowl, said \\"Sexual Healing\\" stood out from other Woods jokes and proved Parker and Stone \\"can do satire like nobody else\\". He particularly praised the Woods video game and the subplot with Butters trying to learn about women's pubic hair, claiming, \\"Butters‚Äô low intelligence and complete innocence make for some the greatest moments that the show has to offer.\\" Entertainment Weekly television reviewer Ken Tucker said the episode was \\"rather short on laugh-out-loud funniness\\", but included several clever ideas, including the Tiger Woods video game, the satire of the media attention to the Woods scandal, and \\"one of the best Kenny death scenes ever\\". Newsweek writer Joshua Alston said the Woods parody \\"didn't manage to be terribly funny or insightful\\", and suggested the speed at which South Park writers can produce a topical episode just days before its broadcast is actually a detriment to the show. Alston said, \\"Whereas once the show's creators swiftly turned around topical episodes because they could, now the South Park team is expected to seize on the news.\\" Ramsey Isler of IGN found much of the episode's humor mediocre, in particular the rehabilitation of the celebrities and the CDC studies of the chimpanzees. Isler said he enjoyed Kenny's death and Butters' obsession with \\"bush\\", but felt the theme of the episode was too obvious and less clever than previous South Park episodes. The A.V. Club writer Zack Handlen appreciated the timeliness and relevance of the subject matter, but felt \\"the satirical target here wasn't meaty enough to warrant a full episode, and the developing plot just felt too half-assed\\". Handlen said some individual jokes were funny, but the episode as a whole was too one-note and redundant. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine said the Woods scandal was several months old, so the episode felt stale and old news. Delgado felt the alien infection theory was too random and lazy, and the idea that men would cheat on their wives if they had more money and opportunity was offensive, but not entirely untrue. Within days of the episode's original broadcast, rumors began to spread throughout the Internet that EA Sports planned to sue Parker and Stone over their portrayal of the Tiger Woods PGA Tour video game in \\"Sexual Healing\\". The rumor began with a March 21 post on the blog Daily Informer, which quoted an unnamed EA Sports source who said the episode had \\"a few copyright infringements in there that I‚Äôm sure will be dealt with accordingly\\". The claims quickly spread to other blogs and websites, but EA Sports specifically denied the rumor, claiming, \\"The reports that EA Sports is planning to sue the creators of 'South Park' are completely false.\\" Home release \\"Sexual Healing\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's fourteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011.

His father, Ysidoro Soto, was an officer in the Mexican army at Monterey. Lazaro Soto was also a soldier in the Mexican army of California. Lazaro Soto received the one square league grant in Carmel Valley in 1839. Lazaro Soto married Felicita Cantua and he and his family resided in Monterey. Lazaro Soto was the officer in charge of horses and munitions at the Battle of Natividad. Lazaro Soto sold Rancho Canada de la Segunda to Andrew Randall. Andrew Randall (1819-1856), a native of Rhode Island, came to California in 1849 as the newly appointed customs inspector for Monterey. Randall was an entrepreneur with training as a geologist. He founded, and was elected chairman of the California Academy of Sciences.Science Amid the Saloons: The Academy Begins In addition to Rancho Ca√±ada de la Segunda, he was the claimant for Rancho San Lorenzo in Monterey County; Rancho Punta de los Reyes and Rancho Punta de los Reyes Sobrante in Marin County; and Rancho Aguas Frias in Butte County - a little over . However Randall had stretched his credit to the limit, and he could not, or would not pay immediately. Joseph Hetherington, a creditor, undertook to force payment by hounding him on every occasion with insults and threats. Hetherington fatally shot Randall in a San Francisco hotel on July 24, 1856. Hetherington was allowed to have an interview with his attorney Fletcher Mathews Haight, and the Committee of Vigilance hanged Hetherington July 29, 1856. Fletcher M. Haight (1799‚Äì1866), a prominent San Francisco lawyer, acquired the property from the Randall estate.

He rose to become a consequential participant in air operations to support Operation Overlord, the invasion of France during the Second World War. Early life Victor Emmanuel Groom was born 4 August 1898 in Peckham, London, England. Groom was educated at Alleyn's School, Dulwich. He enlisted into the Artists Rifles, London Regiment, as a private in 1916 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the West Yorkshire Regiment on 26 April 1917 before being attached to the Royal Flying Corps in September.Bristol F 2 Fighter Aces of World War I, p. 51. World War I Details of his training are unrecorded. However, Groom was appointed a flying officer on 30 January 1918 and placed on the General List of the Royal Flying Corps. On 18 March, he was assigned to No. 20 Squadron as a Bristol F.2 Fighter pilot. On his first combat flight, his formation leader fired a Very flare that landed in the rear cockpit of Groom's Bristol. While the observer burned his hands smothering the fire that threatened to set off munitions, Groom safely landed. Having survived friendly fire, Groom began to triumph over enemy fire on 8 May 1918, when he began a string of eight victories that would take him through to 30 July. Groom's final tally was three enemy planes set afire, four otherwise destroyed, and one driven down out of control; his observer/gunner for all these victories was Ernest Hardcastle. Groom went on leave, was laid low by influenza, and did not return to combat in France. Instead, upon recovery, he was posted to No. 111 Squadron in Egypt. Between the World Wars On 1 August 1919, Groom was granted a permanent commission as a lieutenant. On 15 December, he switched to No. 14 Squadron in Palestine and on 22 May 1920, he continued Middle Eastern service with a new posting, to No. 55 Squadron. On 25 March 1922, Groom returned home to begin a decade of staff assignments, enlivened only by being promoted from flying officer to flight lieutenant on 1 July 1924. He was given command of No. 28 Squadron on 26 October 1932. On 1 October 1934 he was promoted to squadron leader, his rank catching up with his position. He moved on to command of No. 58 Squadron, then on to staff work at Headquarters Bomber Command, even as he continued to ascend in rank. On 1 January 1938, having earned an OBE at Bomber Command, he was promoted to wing commander. World War II On 1 September 1940, he was promoted to temporary group captain and became Station Commander at RAF Marham. In 1941, he moved back into staff work in the Directorate of Plans. The following year, he became head of the RAF Air Staff planning for Operation Overlord. As part of his duties there, he accompanied Air Chief Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory to North Africa to study operations there and bring home lessons learned. In the meantime, he continued his climb through the ranks: on 18 November 1942, he was confirmed as a group captain. On 1 June 1943, he was bumped up to temporary air commodore and on 8 September 1943 he was promoted to acting air vice marshal on appointment as Senior Air Staff Officer at Headquarters Second Tactical Air Force. On 8 September 1944 he was promoted to air commodore while acting as air vice marshal. In August 1945 he became Air Officer Administration at Headquarters Flying Training Command. Post World War II Groom became Director General of Manning for the RAF on 1 January 1947 and took command of No. 205 Group on 20 October 1949. On 1 January 1952, he was promoted from air vice marshal to air marshal and appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He took command of the Middle East Air Force in February 1952 and Technical Training Command in July 1952. Groom retired to Putney on 26 September 1955 and died on 6 December 1990.Above the Trenches: a Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the British Empire Air Forces 1915‚Äì1920, p. 178.

The school was founded as the Community Music School of Greater Vancouver in 1969 through efforts made by the Vancouver Community Arts Council. The school was originally located on West 12th Ave but relocated to the Music Centre in Vanier Park in May 1976. The school officially changed its name to the Vancouver Academy of Music in 1979. The VAM currently has two divisions of study, a college division for students wanting to pursue a performance career and a preparatory division for school-age children and adults.Vancouver Academy of Music at Encyclopedia of Music in Canada History When the VAM was initially founded, it only offered classes for young children in the Orff, Suzuki, and Kod√°ly methods. In 1971 trumpeter Jerold Gerbrecht (longtime principal trumpet of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra) was brought in as music director to expand the school to include adult classes in music theory, history, composition, dance, and private instrumental and voice instruction. The school also formed an orchestra and a choir, but at this time still did not grant degrees. The Academy's program offerings continued to expand throughout the 1970s and 1980s with master classes, opera workshops, and other specialized courses. This success led the school to establish a collegiate program, the S. K. Lee College Program, in 1987 in partnership with Thompson Rivers University and the British Columbia Open University (BCOU). Students attend non-music classes at TRU and have their music courses at the Academy. Bachelor of Music degrees are awarded through the BCOU. Orchestras The Academy has Junior, Intermediate, and Senior Symphony Orchestras. Three times a year, the Senior Academy Strings joins forces with the wind department to form the Academy Symphony Orchestra to perform at the Vancouver Orpheum Theatre. Notable conductors include the late Sidney Harth.

She was co-editor of Radical Software (1970), the first publication to discuss the possibilities of the new video medium, and _Video Art_ (1976) with Ira Schneider. Her first multiple channel works (Dachau 1974 and Text and Commentary) were seen at such diverse venues as The Kitchen (1975), Leo Castelli Gallery (1977), Dokumenta 6 (1977), and the Whitney Museum (1980 and 2002), Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum (2010) among others and explored the structural relationship between programming on the ancient technology of the loom and computer programming. Dachau was a four channel video work, consisting of footage taken in 1974 at the former concentration camp, Dachau. The recordings focused on the symmetry of the architecture and the present ambiance of the space, taking inspiration from the technology of the loom Korot combined her many separate elements (in this case video footage) to develop a piece of work that reflected the patterns it was formed of. Text and Commentary consisted of five video channels on five monitors showing Korot weaving on a loom. The resulting textiles are placed directly opposite from the monitors, with the viewer seated on a bench between the woven text of the textiles and the video commentary. The installation also included Korot's drawings and pictographic scores, which were the basis for both the textile production and video editing. The work explores the non-decorative meaning and numerical basis of abstract pattern, with Korot understanding the loom, with its use of punch cards, to be an early form of communication technology. Traditionally both weaving and computing have been understood as women's professions, but Korot examines both from a feminist perspective, moving beyond associations with both domesticity and femininity and placing textile art within the canon of fine art. The installation was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art. Dachau 1974 is in the Kramlich Collection. Her painted text- based handwoven canvases in an original language were exhibited in 1986 at the John Weber Gallery and in 1990 at the Carnegie Museum (Points of Departure). Two video/music collaborations with Steve Reich (The Cave, 1993, and Three Tales, 2002) brought video installation art into a theatrical context. Both works continue to be performed and have been installed, apart from live performances, at such venues as the Whitney Museum, the Carnegie Museum, the Reina Sofia, the D√ºsseldorf Kunsthalle, and ZKM. Since 2003 she has been creating a new body of video and print work which was seen at Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum for the first time, in Beryl Korot: Text/Weave/Line, Video 1977-2010, and subsequently at Dartmouth College Fall 2011 and bitforms gallery, Spring 2012, among others. She is a Guggenheim Fellow and has received numerous grants for her work from the NEA, NYSCA, and most recently from Anonymous Was a Woman (2008). Korot has been married to composer Steve Reich since 1976. They have one son, Ezra Reich, born in 1978.

The presence of Pakistanis in Qatar can be traced back to the 1940s when early community members arrived and settled. Early Pakistanis were initially professionals mainly in the services sector. The large Pakistani business community plays a role in the development of the host country (refer to Together For Excellence by Ashraf Siddiqui). Pakistani professionals serve in the fields of petroleum, construction, banking, finance, education, engineering, medicine, social work and beyond.

Pakistan Education Centre (PEC) One of the early expatriate schools, it was formed in 1967 then affiliated with Lahore Board of Higher Secondary School Examinations. Led by Dr. Abdul Qawi, active & leading Pakistani community members first started this school in Maguvilina District of Doha. On a decision by the Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1978, some of the schools run by Pakistani community members were taken over by the Pakistan Embassy. Since then. Pakistan Education Center (Pakistani School) is run by Pakistan ambassador with the help of a Board of Governors. The current school premises were given to the Pakistani community by the Government of Qatar. These are the first ever premises given to any expatriate community and were inaugurated in 1985 by the then president of Pakistan, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Pakistani School name was renamed as PEC in 1985. The school is affiliated to the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (FBISE), Islamabad, Pakistan. All Pakistani schools formed in Doha, Qatar were established by experienced Pakistani nationals who have worked in Pakistan. PEC, offers education from kindergarten right up to senior high school and Intermediate levels. It has a separate wing for Cambridge Education System, started in September 2013.

Career  Hurst had hoped to read Natural Sciences at Cambridge University, but became ill at a critical time, possibly with tuberculosis, and this prevented him attending,Cock, Alan G. & Forsdyke, D.R. 2008. Treasure Your Exceptions. The Science and Life of William Bateson. Springer, Berlin. Chapter 10. pp. 269‚Äì294. Bateson's Bulldog. although he recovered and led an active life thereafter. Hurst inherited a plant nursery business in the small Leicestershire village of Burbage. At his Burbage laboratories, a part of the family plant nurseries, Hurst carried out his studies on hybridisation in orchids. He wrote an early paper proposing that new species evolved from hybridisation, based on his orchid knowledge, in 1898,Hurst, C. C. 1898. Curiosities of orchid breeding. Nature (London) 59:178‚Äì181 almost two decades before similar theories were published by Johannes Paulus Lotsy.Lotsy, J. P. 1916. Evolution by Means of Hybridization. Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague Hurst was a frequent correspondent and friend to William Bateson and helped in the introduction of Mendelian genetics in the early 20th century. Also in Burbage, Hurst collected the first data to advance the theory that blue eye colour was recessive to brown. He carried out many investigations into the genetics of coat colour inheritance in horses, chickens and other domestic animals. As well as studying eye colour in humans, he was an ardent eugenicist and believed fervently that the human race could be improved by genetic study. In his book on 'Creative Evolution'Hurst C.C. 1932. The Mechanism of Creative Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. he advocated a theory of musical ability based on Mendelian loci. Although an early promoter and lifelong supporter of Mendelian genetics and a friend of Bateson's, he appears to have parted ways with his mentor on some points. In his 1932 book on The Mechanism of Creative EvolutionHurst C.C. 1932. The Mechanism of Creative Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. Hurst adopted the chromosome theory of inheritance whole-heartedly referring copiously to Thomas Hunt Morgan's Drosophila work, and he was also clearly a staunch Darwinist. He believed that natural selection and Mendelian genetics were compatible, and referred to the theoretical work of Sewall Wright, R.A. Fisher, and J.B.S. Haldane, which proved that quantitative traits and natural selection were compatible with Mendelism. As he argued in Creative Evolution (1932), p. xix: :\\"The genetical approach to Darwinism has been further strengthened by the mathematical work of Fisher and Haldane, which has placed the study of natural selection on a higher plane, and has provided a new tool and approach to the problem, from which much is expected during the next decade. Fisher's work on The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, with its new views of the origin of dominance and the natural selection of genotypes, has already become a classic. J.B.S. Haldane's Mathematical Theory of Natural Selection shows that in evolution, neither mutation nor Lamarckian transformation can prevail against natural selection of even moderate intensity. In America, Sewall Wright has also made an extensive mathematical investigation of the problem of evolution and natural selection, and in the main his results agree with those of Fisher and Haldane although he attaches more importance to random survivals in medium-sized populations than either Fisher or Haldane.\\" Hurst was also a major initiator of the modern \\"genetical species concept\\" later known as the biological species concept. This was very much in tune with William Bateson's own beliefs, and Bateson's views on this topic were accepted by many other geneticists worldwide, including Theodosius Dobzhansky. Here is Hurst's concept of species in Creative Evolution (1932), p. 66-7: :\\"A species is a group of individuals of common descent, with certain constant specific characters in common which are represented in the nucleus of each cell by constant and characteristic sets of chromosomes carrying homozygous specific genes, causing as a rule intra-fertility and inter-sterility. On this view the species is no longer an arbitrary conception convenient to the taxonomist, a mere new name or label, but rather a real specific entity which can be experimentally demonstrated genetically and cytologically. Once the true nature of species is realised and recognised in terms of genes and chromosomes, the way is open to trace its evolution and origin, and the genetical species becomes a measurable and experimental unit of evolution.\\" Such views were typical of the stance in evolutionary biology, adopted later by and today mainly credited to Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr, and dubbed \\"The Modern Synthesis\\" by Julian Huxley in 1942.  Significance  Hurst was famous for his work on hybridisation and breeding in orchids, but also for carrying out early studies into eye colour genetics (demonstrating the dominance of brown eyes over blue in 1905), and animal coat coloration (in subjects ranging from horses to chickens). William Bateson was credited as the scientist who first brought Mendel's theories to the English speaking-world, and the coiner of the term 'genetics'. Given the nickname 'Bateson's Bulldog',Cock, Alan G. & Forsdyke, D.R. 2008. Treasure Your Exceptions. The Science and Life of William Bateson. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. Chapter 10. Bateson's Bulldog. pp. 269‚Äì294. Hurst has been described along with Bateson as one of the two leaders of Mendelism in England at the turn of the 20th century. Bateson and Hurst collaborated in the battle against the biometricians Karl Pearson and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, with Hurst generating much data from experimental crosses of different plant varieties and animal colour variants, including chickens, horses, and man. Together they practically proved that Mendelian genetics could be extended to many different systems. Hurst was much younger than Bateson, but had a fiery passion for genetics, great skill in debate, and an approachableness lacking in some of his older peers which meant he was well respected within the scientific and lay community.

He is voiced by Larry the Cable Guy and inspired by a 1956‚Äì57 International Harvester Tow truck and 1955-1957 Chevrolet Task Force. Portrayed as Holley Shiftwell's boyfriend and best friend and Lightning McQueen's best friend and sidekick, he had a breakout role in Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales and in other media related to Cars. Background Mater's design is based on a 1955 -57 Chevrolet Task Force Tow truck once used to lift equipment from mine shafts in Cherokee County, Kansas. The Route 66 Town of Galena is named for the lead sulphite ore galena, to which the series of small mining Towns around Baxter Springs owe their boom and subsequent bust. The original truck is currently based at a former Kan-O-Tex Service Station in Galena; the station was restored as a Route 66 diner and souvenir shop by Four Women on the Route one year after the film's 2006 release. Mater is the son of Sarah Frances Dillon and James Conner. Mater's driving skills include a claim to be \\"the world's best backwards driver,\\" an ability picked up from none other than Dean Walker, a Kansas Historic Route 66 Association president known in Riverton as \\"Crazy Legs Walker, the Ambassador of Crazy Feet on Route 66\\" for his ability to twist his feet backward and walk in reverse. Mater takes his nickname from construction superintendent and die-hard NASCAR fan Douglas \\"Mater\\" Keever, who provides the voice of one of the RV's watching the big race (\\"Well dip me in axle grease and call me slick!\\"). The RV's vantage point at the race is modelled on a \\"Redneck Hill\\" at Charlotte Motor Speedway favoured by hardcore fans in tents and pop-up campers. The character Mater speaks with a hick Southern redneck accent with a dash of hillbilly twang and frequently uses incorrect syntax. The real-life person who was the inspiration for Mater's voice is Harley Russell from Erick, Oklahoma on Route 66. Harley's natural voice has the same sound and same mannerisms as Mater. Mater's final personality was based on his voice actor, Larry the Cable Guy, and he uses many of Larry's catchphrases, including \\"Git-R-Done\\" during the final race sequence and \\"I don't care who you are; that's funny right there\\" during the tractor tipping scene. Larry the Cable Guy spent time with Harley Russell to learn the voice for the character. A Cars \\"Rev'd Up\\" DVD released as a 2006 bonus in Target stores describes Mater as inspired by a 1957 Dodge truck. Characterization Mater's color was originally baby blue as shown in a flashback when he was young; however, over the years he has rusted into a patchwork light brown/orange color with some of the blue still showing through. He is missing his hood and his left headlight.In the short \\"Mater Private Eye\\", part of the Mater's Tall Tales series, it is explained that he lost the headlight when a gangster named Clyde popped it out with a screwdriver. In the short Mater and the Ghostlight, his right headlight fell out as well. During the first Cars movie credits Mater fished his hood from a cliff up in Tailfin Pass, and his hood showed more of its original color than the rest of Mater. But then Mater sneezed, causing the hood to fall back down the cliff. His license plate number is A113.http://kidstvmovies.about.com/b/2011/06/24/cars-2-what-to-know-before- you-go.htm Mater is also capable of racing, as well as being the (self- proclaimed) world's best backwards driver. He attributes his skill to his rear-view mirrors and his own philosophy: \\"Don't need to know where I'm going, just need to know where I've been.\\" He teaches Lightning this skill and is proud when he uses it in the Piston Cup race, proudly telling Chick's stunned pit crew \\"I taught him that!\\" This was further noted in Cars 2, when Mater drives backwards away from McQueen (so that he can get the bomb that was strapped in his air filter away from McQueen's reach), he was able to avoid himself from crashing, an act that left Darrell Cartrip saying, \\"He's gotta be the world's best backwards driver\\". In Cars 2, Mater displays a vast encyclopedic savant like knowledge of automotive parts and engines. He correctly answers a code question concerning the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia asked by British intelligence agent Holley Shiftwell, leading her to mistake him for an American agent she is supposed to meet. Later, when Shiftwell and her partner Finn McMissile show Mater a photograph of a mystery car's engine, he identifies it on sight and points out the spare parts being used to keep it running. His incredible knowledge helps McMissile and Shiftwell capture Sir Miles Axlerod, the main villain of this film. Mater is given an honorary knighthood by the Queen. Appearances=Cars Mater runs \\"Tow Mater Towing & Salvage\\" and is the first to befriend and support Lightning throughout his adventure in Radiator Springs. During the film, Mater shows Lightning how to do \\"Tractor-Tippin'\\" and how to drive backwards without crashing, a technique which Lightning uses to counter Chick Hicks' dirty racing in the Piston Cup tiebreaker. In the end, McQueen asks Tex to give Mater an opportunity to fly in a Dinoco helicopter like he always wanted, saying to Sally that Mater is his best friend. Cars 2 Mater replica in Phoenix, Arizona Mater's friendship with Lightning McQueen has grown rather than diminished, with a lengthy best-friend handshake to prove it. Mater values every dent made during his adventures with Lightning as symbolic of their friendship. In an attempt to defend his friend against rival racing opponent Francesco Bernoulli, Mater gets Lightning to race in the World Grand Prix. Lightning in turn invites Mater to join him, and they set out from Radiator Springs to Tokyo for the first race. Mater is soon mistaken for an American secret agent and caught up in the world of spies. Agent Holley Shiftwell plays Mater's love interest/girlfriend; Mater is mesmerized by her beauty and falls for her immediately. During the first race, Mater accidentally causes a miscommunication that costs McQueen the race; resulting in McQueen lashing out at Mater and telling him that he doesn't need or want his help any more. In fact, McQueen suggests that Mater's antics are the reason why McQueen doesn't normally take him along to his races. Feeling saddened and very guilty, Mater decides to return home, only to continue his 'mission' with the British agents. Mater ultimately solves the mystery of the World Grand Prix during the third and final race in London, and is granted an honorary knighthood for his bravery. At the end of the film, he decides to compete in the unofficial Radiator Springs Grand Prix with McQueen after getting a pair of rocket jets. Cars 3 Mater takes on a more supporting role in Cars 3. Mater remains McQueen's best friend and supporter, never missing any races to proudly show much support, going as far as wearing over the top wearable merchandises. He is also there with Sally to comfort McQueen after he crashes, and is among the rest of the Radiator Springs residents witnessing McQueen ultimately make the decision to keep racing. Later, in the middle of the film, a downbeat McQueen calls Mater by FaceTime phone, and they both have a nice, heartwarming conversation. McQueen asks Mater for help after seeing that Jackson Storm, a car, has a new speed record, having the potential to beat Lightning McQueen. In response, Mater unconsciously suggests that McQueen track down and get some advice from Doc Hudson's mentor, Smokey. He is seen to be aware of Sterling's selfish plans beneath his words and buys McQueen some time by distracting him from keeping McQueen to get Cruz Ramirez to replace him for the race. He is also seen with everyone in Radiator Springs when Lightning shows his new appearance. In a post-credits scene, Mater is singing a funny song and is cleaning in his lot, and when his phone rings, he gets startled and jumps in fright then inadvertently knocks over his reception antenna along with tires falling down from his shack's roof, and the FaceTime on his phone goes dead, much to his dismay. Mater and the Ghostlight The short film follows Mater's day-to-day activities after things have returned to normal in Radiator Springs. Mater likes to play scary pranks on other characters until a blue light begins haunting him. His final prank is his most successful: Lightning McQueen sees a tow hook hanging from behind a stack of cans and, assuming that Mater is hiding behind it, approaches to foil the prank. Mater then jumps off of the roof of Flo's caf√©, screaming behind McQueen, who then is startled and knocks over the pile of cans, revealing that the hook was actually from the sign of Mater's place of business, thus a decoy. Everyone starts to laugh at McQueen for having fallen for this clever trick, and Mater teases, \\"Whoa, Buddy. You look like you seen ... the Ghostlight!\\" Sheriff admonishes him for \\"mocking the Ghostlight,\\" a character of urban legend amongst the cars. The Ghostlight is described as a \\"glowing orb of blue, translucent light\\" that haunts Radiator Springs, and hates nothing more than the sound of clanking metal ‚Äì a sound frequently made by Mater's rickety shell. Sheriff continues to tell the story of a young couple lost in the area, whose only remains were \\"two out-of-state license plates.\\" He then concludes with an overly cheerful \\"Well, g'night.\\" The population of Radiator Springs then leaves within seconds, leaving a very nervous Mater by himself. As he reaches his garage he is first frightened by a \\"lightning bug\\" (a tiny flying Volkswagen Beetle with bright headlights). As he relaxes, a bright blue glow suddenly appears behind him and he goes into a blind panic, driving around in a frenzy, first going along the main road, then going through the tractor field, past Frank, then around Willy's Butte, and doing a lock-strafe move after that, until he is exhausted. The Ghostlight however, is just a glowing blue lantern to Mater's towing cable hung up by McQueen and Guido. The short ends with Mater finally collapsing on the road before finally realizing that it's just a blue lantern. It was then the rest of the folks surround him and laugh at him, revealing the joke as retribution for the pranks he did to them (with his best friend Lightning laughing the loudest and throwing in a \\"Gotcha!\\"). The credits roll and after them there is a closing shot where the frightened Mater finds he has a huge construction vehicle behind him, snarling and carrying the license plate \\"Banshee.\\" Mater does not realize who it is though and warns it of the Screaming Banshee before driving off, bidding the confused Banshee good night. Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales Mater is the main character in his animated short series, Cars Toon: Mater's Tall Tales with Larry the Cable Guy reprising his role. Each tale begins with Mater telling a far-fetched story of his past. In the story, Mater finds himself in an inescapable predicament. When McQueen questions Mater over whether the events in the story actually occurred, Mater responds, \\"Don't you remember? You was there too!\\", and continues the story including McQueen's sudden participation. The short series end with Mater leaving the scene, often followed by characters or references to the story that was being told, putting up a possibility that the story might have been real. Video games Mater appears in all Cars video games and with Larry the Cable Guy reprising his role in all video games to date (with the exception of Cars 3: Driven to Win). In the video game Cars, Mater is a playable character in the Arcade Mode, \\"Tractor Tipping\\", and \\"Rustbucket Race-O-Rama\\" levels. He does commentary for the race in \\"Radiator Springs Grand Prix\\" and \\"Radiator Springs GP\\". He teaches McQueen how to drive backwards in \\"Mater's Backwards Lesson\\". Mater is a playable character in both the Story and Arcade Modes of Cars Mater-National Championship. The Cars Race-O-Rama video game introduces new rivals to Mater: Bubba, Tater and Tater Jr., all of them tow trucks. However, Tater and Tater Jr. later befriend Mater. Mater also makes an appearance as a playable character and figure in Disney Infinity. He is also a playable character in Cars 3: Driven to Win.

Early life Gray was born in Greenock, Scotland in 1948.\\"International Who's Who in Classical Music\\" (2003) p.313 She showed an early talent in music and supplemented the usual Scottish primary and secondary state school education with private lessons in both singing and piano.A Life Behind Curtains: A Singer's Silent Sounds Linda Esther Gray 2007 Green Oak Publishing, In 1965 this tuition, and her natural ability, provided her with the skills to successfully gain a place at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama as an undergraduate student.Biography on singbelcanto.com Here she remained for four years concentrating her studies on singing, piano and cello. In 1969 (her final year at the Academy of Music) she won the International Cinzano Singing Award which granted a two-year scholarship to continue her musical education at the London Opera Centre (managed out of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden and also acting at that time as the ROH's rehearsal space). It was in London that as a student she made her first appearance in an opera as Malenka in The Bartered Bride in 1970.The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music (2004). 4th ed, p.302 Also, during this time, Gray continued to win a number of major singing awards (see awards section below). It was the award money from these competitions that allowed her to fund further study in Italy with the head music coach of the San Carlo Opera; Maestro Campanino. Opera career Having completed her studies in Naples, she returned to the UK in 1972 and quickly began to establish her professional career: first with the Glyndebourne Touring Company (part of the Glyndebourne Opera Festival which helps to provide professional experience to young performers) and later within the context of The Glyndebourne Festival itself. It was with this company that, at the age of 23, she made her debut as Mimi in Puccini's La boh√®me ‚Äì a role that remained in her professional repertoire until her retirement.BBC, Woman's Hour: Linda Esther Gray Between her professional debut in 1971 and her final appearance in 1982 Gray toured the UK and Europe performing major roles for a number of major opera companies and houses. These included: Scottish Opera (1974‚Äì1979), English National Opera (1979), Welsh National Opera (1981), The Royal Opera House (1982).The International Who's Who of Women (2002) p.215 Her American debut was in Dallas in 1981 where she sang as Sieglinde in Richard Wagner's Die Walk√ºre. During this time she became the Isolde of choice for famous British Wagnerian conductor Sir Reginald Goodall. Not only did she perform the role at a number of opera houses with Goodall conducting but Gray went on to record the role for him on the first digital recording of Tristan und Isolde in 1982.WOSU-FM, Classical Notes As the early 1980s progressed Gray's international fame and reputation grew and plans began to take place for her perform major roles at both La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera House but these were to never come to fruition. Instead, Grays operatic career shortly came to a permanent halt. Concert career Like many established opera singers, Gray also had a successful concert career. This included performances of works by Mahler, Verdi, Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn, Elgar, Rossini and Britten, together with song cycles by Wagner, Richard Strauss, Sibelius and Schumann. Special mention should be given to three performances: First, in 1981 she sang with the English National Opera when it celebrated its Golden Jubilee in the presence of the Queen. In 1982 she performed in front of the Prince of Wales at the London Coliseum, as part of a national tribute to British troops returning from the Falklands War. Finally, and also in 1982, Gray became the first Scottish soprano to sing at the opening night of the Edinburgh Festival, performing in Beethoven's 9th Symphony. Accompanied on the piano by Stephen Maughan, Gray returned to the concert platform in 2002 for a recital of Richard Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder. The historic occasion took place on 18th May at St. Columba's-by-the-Castle in Edinburgh, and was hosted by the Wagner Society of Scotland. Media personality During her career Gray became something of a media personality, appearing alongside baritone Geraint Evans in the BBC chat show Three's Company and with her former music teacher Dame Eva Turner in one of several radio phone-ins discussing singing. She took part in BBC Radio 4's Food Program and was photographed by David Bailey for The Observer. Retirement from the stage Gray retired from the opera stage in 1982 after an illness left her unable to continue. She has been described as \\"one of the most lyric of modern sopranos\\", and was \\"expected to be the next Callas\\". After many years of seclusion from the media she published her autobiography in 2007: A Life Behind Curtains: A Singer's Silent Sounds. She is now an opera coach working from her home in Surrey. Principal roles While Gray sang many major opera roles (a number of them many times), her principal roles are considered to have been: * Isolde: Tristan und Isolde (Wagner) * Sieglinde: Die Walk√ºre (Wagner) * Kundry: Parsifal (Wagner) * Tosca: Tosca (Puccini) * Leonore: Fidelio (Beethoven) Discography * Mahler: Symphony no. 8.

He was martyred during the great persecution of Shapur II. Like several other early bishops of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, he is included in the traditional list of patriarchs of the Church of the East. He is considered a saint in some quarters.  Sources  Brief accounts of Shadost's episcopate and martyrdom are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), Amr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). A more substantial account of his patriarchate is also given in the Chronicle of Seert. In all these accounts he is anachronistically called 'catholicus' or 'patriarch', a term that was only applied to the primates of the Church of the East in the fifth century.  Shahdost's episcopate and martyrdom  The earliest, and most substantial account of Shadost's episcopate and martyrdom is given in the ninth-century Chronicle of Seert: > The name Shahdost is Persian and it means a lover and devotee of the king (< > shƒÅh 'king' and d≈´st 'friend'). The Shahdust of Ctesiphon was from Beth > Garmai, though some people say he was from Susa. He was the archdeacon of > Shemon Bar Sabbae. Since, after the death of Shemon, the church was without > a leader, he gave himself to our Lord Jesus Christ and was named patriarch > secretly. He was a good and pious man. It is said that the fathers and the > faithful, meeting in secret, prayed to God, then wrote down several names > and drew them by lot. The name of Shahdost was drawn. He accepted the charge > that had been entrusted to him without being discouraged by the fear of > death, and received the investiture of the patriarchate in the house of a > Christian. He chose some men and ordained them to replace the fathers who > had been martyred with the holy Mar Shemon. Among them was Barbashmin, the > nephew of Shemon bar Sabbae. They pledged themselves to die on behalf of > their flocks. They began to visit the Christians night and day to encourage > them against the persecution of Shapur. Finally, Shahdost's rank was > discovered, and he was arrested by the magi. Three nights earlier, he had > seen in a dream a ladder, with its foot on the earth and its head in heaven. > Shemon was standing on the ladder, and said, 'Shahdost, climb up to me on > this ladder, as I climbed it yesterday.' He knew what this signified. He > spoke of it to the faithful, who were alarmed on his account. Then, three > days later, he was arrested in Seleucia-Ctesiphon with 128 bishops, priests, > deacons and Christian men and women. They remained in prison for five > months, suffering all kinds of tortures. They were urged to embrace the > religion of the magi, but they remained firm in their faith. The satrap of > Seleucia-Ctesiphon then ordered 120 of them to be killed, but he sent > Shahdost with the Christian women to Shapur. When the patriarch came before > him, the king said to him, 'I have killed Shemon, the head of the > Christians, and a large number of abbots and bishops. Why have you become > the head of the people that I detest?' Shahdost replied, 'The head of the > Christians is the Most High God. It is he who gives them the head of his > choice. The sea will never be drained dry, and Christianity will never be > destroyed. The more Christians you kill, the more they will multiply.' The > accursed man grew angry with him, then he treated him gently, hoping to > persuade him to worship the sun, and talked to him in a friendly manner in > the hope of converting him to the religion of the magi. But far from > converting him, he got nothing back from him but energetic and harsh words > and the most lively resistance. He then ordered his death, and this order > was carried out in the same spot where Shemon had been put to death. His > companions were also killed. This happened in the month of March, after five > months' incarceration. Among them were Miles al-Razi, his disciple Aborsam > and several others, including Shemon's two sisters. The faithful collected > their bodies and buried them in the church. According to this account, > Shahdost was patriarch for two years and five months.Chronicle of Seert, i. > 99‚Äì101 A shorter version, mostly dependent on the account in the Chronicle of Seert but with some interesting divergences, was given by the twelfth-century historian Mari: > Shahdost had a Persian name which means 'friend of the king'. He was a > native of Beth Garmai (or, according to some, of Susa) and the archdeacon of > the patriarch Shemon Bar Sabbae. After his death, when the church was > deprived of its leader, he devoted his life to Christ, and was consecrated > patriarch in secret. He was an honest man. They say that when his name > emerged when the fathers drew lots, he did not attempt to refuse the office > because he feared death, and was consecrated in the house of one of the > believers. He appointed many metropolitans and bishops, who went out and > encouraged the faithful to stand firm and resist the perfidy of Shapur. Two > years later an edict was issued by Shapur, and Shahdost was arrested. He saw > in a dream Shemon Bar Sabbae standing at the top of a ladder, who said to > him, 'Shahdost, come up to me, just as I went up.' When he told the dream to > the believers, they grieved for him. Three days after his dream he was > arrested, along with 128 priests, deacons, monks and nuns. They were thrown > into prison for five months, and subjected to tortures to make them embrace > Magianism, but they stood firm. The marzban killed 120 of them, all men, but > sent Shahdost and the nuns to Shapur in al-Madain, who invited him to become > a magus, and said that he would not allow the Christians to live unless he > gave in. Shahdost replied, 'So long as there is water in the sea, there will > be Christians.' The king became angry, and executed Shahdost and his > companions in the month of April, after keeping them in prison for five > months. Shahdost governed the church for two years and five months.Mari, 19 > (Arabic), 16‚Äì17 (Latin) A third version, written up with a number of stylistic embellishments from the account in the Chronicle of Seert, was given by the thirteenth-century Jacobite historian Bar Hebraeus: > After Shemon Bar Sabbae, Shahdost. This is a Persian name, signifying 'the > king's friend', which the Greeks render as Sadok. This Shahdost was the > archdeacon of Shemon Bar Sabbae and his nephew by his sister, and hailed > from Beth Garmai. Three months after his master's death he was secretly > elected and consecrated at Seleucia. Two years later he saw in a dream fire > continually ascending from the earth to heaven, and Shemon Bar Sabbae > calling him and saying, 'My brother Shahdost, enter into the joy of your > Lord.' The rumour of that vision reached the impious Shapur, and the > catholicus was arrested along with 118 priests, believers and monks, and two > brothers of Shahdost, and they were all killed for professing the Christian > faith. Shahdost is said to have been first brought into Shapur's presence, > who said to him, 'I killed Shemon, the head of the Christians, and with him > a number of bishops, and have you therefore been made the head of the people > that I detest?' And that holy man replied, 'God is the head of the > Christians, and he places over them whomsoever he wishes. Just as the sea > never runs short of water, Christianity will never perish from the earth.' > Shapur, angered by his words, ordered him to be killed along with his > companions.Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed.

He married Charito, a daughter of Tiberius II Constantine and Ino Anastasia. According to Michael Whitby, Germanus was a patrician and governor of the praetorian prefecture of Africa. He was chosen by the dying Tiberius II as a viable heir for his throne in 582. \\"In a dual ceremony on 5 August Germanus ... and Maurice were elevated to the rank of Caesar and betrothed to Tiberius' two daughters, Charito and Constantina.\\".Whitby (1988), p. 7 Whitby regards the arrangement as indicating Tiberius' plans to have two co-rulers as successors. He suggests that the dying emperor might have even been trying to reintroduce the concept of a Western and Eastern Roman Emperor, with Germanus and Maurice chosen for their respective connections to the western and eastern provinces of the Empire. Whitby identifies this Germanus with a similarly named son born to Germanus (d. 550) and Matasuntha.Whitby (1988), p. 7 According to a statement in Jordanes' Getica, the senior Germanus was a descendant of the noble Roman clan of the Anicii. The exact nature of his connection however, if it is anything more than a literary device to indicate noble descent, is unclear. Theodor Mommsen hypothesized that his mother could have been a daughter of Anicia Juliana.Bury (1958), p. 255 Matasuntha was a daughter of Eutharic and Amalasuntha. She was a sister of Athalaric, King of the Ostrogoths. Their maternal grandparents were Theodoric the Great and Audofleda. Whitby suggests that a dual origin from the Anicii and Ostrogoth royalty would indeed give the new Caesar a strong claim to ruling Africa and the Praetorian prefecture of Italy.Whitby (1988), p. 7 However, the common name \\"Germanus\\" may hint to these figures being related to each other but there are insufficient evidence for identifications. The Chronicle of John of Niki√ª records on the death of Tiberius: \\"He died in peace in the third year of his reign. It was owing to the sins of men that his days were so few; for they were not worthy of such a Godloving emperor, and so they lost this gracious and good man. Before he died he gave orders that his son-in-law, named Germanus, should be raised to the imperial throne. Now he had formerly been patrician. But owing to his humility of heart he refused to be emperor. Thereupon Maurice, who was of the province of Cappadocia, was made emperor.\\" John, Bishop of Nikiu: Chronicle. Chapter XCV (95),25-26. 1916 translation by R. H. Charles. Whitby considers this to be the only primary source for Tiberius preferring Germanus over Maurice. He feels it has more to do with John's bias against Maurice than accuracy. John of Niki√ª vehemently criticizes the religious policies of Maurice and even calls him a paganWhitby (1988), p. 7 The narrative of John of Niki√ª is contradicted by the Historia Francorum of Gregory of Tours which also records Byzantine events. He depicts Maurice as hand-picked to be heir, first by dowager empress Sophia and then by Tiberius II.Whitby (1988), p. 7 Germanus disappears from sources following his marriage. He may have resurfaced as the patricius Germanus mentioned in the 7th century, whose daughter married Maurice's eldest son Theodosius. Once again, the identification is uncertain.Lynda Garland, \\"Constantina, Wife of Maurice\\". 1999 article ReferencesSources  * External links *The Emperor Maurice and his historian: Theophylact Simocatta on Persian and Balkan warfare *Gold medallion commemorating Germanus' marriage to Charito Category:Justinian dynasty Category:6th-century Byzantine people Category:Caesares Category:Anicii ","title":"Germanus (Caesar)"},{"id":"26560773","text":"The Christie Harris Illustrated Children's Literature Prize is awarded annually as the BC Book Prize for Canadian authors and illustrator of picture books, picture story books, and illustrated non-fiction books.

It was first mentioned in written documents dating to 1526 and was one of the oldest churches in the Parish of Osilnica. Some sources indicate that defensive walls stood around the church to protect against Ottoman raids; no trace of these walls remain today. The church stood in the middle of the village cemetery; it had a rectangular nave and an octagonal chancel walled on three sides. A square belfry stood on the north side of the building and the sacristy stood on the south side between the nave and chancel. The present-day ruins date from a rebuilding of the church in the 17th century. The church was assigned to the newly founded Parish of Draga in 1834. The building was reworked at the end of the 19th century with the addition of the belfry, the sacristy, and new windows; the interior was also newly vaulted at this time, and the year 1894 was carved into the stone door casing. The church was covered by a gabled shingled roof. The church was burned down by the Partisans on 22 July 1942.

The diocese, attested between the fifth and eighth centuries, was centred on the town of Ganzak and was included in the metropolitan province of Adiabene. History Map showing the relative positions of Adiabene and Adarbaigan (Atropatene) The diocese of Adarbaigan appears to have covered the territory included within the Sassanian province of Atropatene. It was bounded on the west by the Salmas and Urmi plains to the west of Lake Urmi, and on the south by the diocese of Salakh, which included the districts around the modern town of Rawanduz. Its centre seems to have been the town of Ganzak. Adarbaigan was not among the dioceses assigned to a metropolitan province in 410, but by the eighth century it was part of the metropolitan province of Adiabene. The metropolitan Maran øammeh of Adiabene, who flourished during the third quarter of the eighth century, adjusted the boundaries of the dioceses of Salakh and Adarbaigan, transferring the district of Daibur from Salakh to Adarbaigan and the district of Inner Salakh from Adarbaigan to Salakh. These boundary changes probably affected Christian communities living in the upper valley of the Lesser Zab river.Thomas of Marga, Book of Governors (ed. Wallis Budge), ii. 315‚Äì16 A separate East Syriac metropolitan province was created for Adarbaigan in the second half of the thirteenth century, possibly centred on Tabriz. Raiding and brigandage were rife in Mesopotamia at this period, and the creation of a new East Syriac metropolitan province reflected a migration of Christians from the Tigris plains to the relative safety of Adarbaigan, where there was a strong Mongol military presence. By the sixteenth century the title 'Adarbaigan' had been assumed by the East Syriac bishops of Salmas, doubtless reflecting a memory that the Salmas district had once been part of the diocese of Adarbaigan.  Bishops of Adiabene  The bishop Hosea of 'Ganzak of Adarbaigan' was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Acacius in 486.Chabot, 307 The bishop Yohannan 'of Adarbaigan' was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Mar Aba I in 544.Chabot, 344‚Äì5 The bishop Melchisedec of Adarbaigan adhered by letter to the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554, and was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ezekiel in 576.Chabot, 366 and 368 The bishop Hnanisho ø of Adarbaigan was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Gregory in 605.Chabot, 479  Notes  References  * Assemani, J.

They competed in the New South Wales Cup which they exited in 2011. The club still competes in the NSWRL Women's Premiership, S. G. Ball Cup and Harold Matthews Cup competitions. History=Rip (2005-2006) The club was founded as the Central Coast Rip in 2005 and competed in the S. G. Ball Cup, Harold Matthews Cup and Jersey Flegg Cup. The players were a mix of talent from the local Central Coast Division of Country Rugby League - Group 12 Competition. At the end of the 2006 season and without a finals appearance in any of the competitions the Rip entered, the club was bought out by the Melbourne Storm who turned the Central Coast-based club into their main feeder team. Storm (2007-2009) In 2007 the Central Coast Storm, now a packed side with both local and interstate talent (courtesy of the Melbourne Storm's Victorian based junior's program), began to run a side in the New South Wales Cup, acting as the Storm's feeder club. Along with the new and major support from the Storm, the team received sponsorship from the private health company, Medibank Private for the next three seasons. Part of this sponsorship included more sponsorship of the actual local district competitions. The team's first season in the New South Wales Cup in 2008 ended unsuccessfully, they did not reach the finals and finished in a disappointing 10th place. The team however was able to reveal some notable talent for the Melbourne Storm including promising prop Aiden Tolman, who later graduated to the first team towards the end of the 2008 season. Future first-graders for the Storm who grew their talent at Central Coast included Sinbad Kali, Kevin Proctor and Matt Duffie with the later two contributing to Melbourne Storm's clinching of the 2009 Toyota National Youth Competition. The 2009 season would end up being the final season for the Central Coast Storm before they were to wound-up by the Melbourne Storm. Their final season however, turned out to be their most successful. Throughout the season, the team was always both consistent and also a very attacking football-team. This culminated with the Storm finishing a very credible 2nd place behind the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs-feeder team, the Bankstown City Bulls. The team's first finals appearance turned out to be a shocker. The team went against the 7th-placed Western Suburbs in the first-week of the finals. A win would have seen the Central Coast Storm one win away from their first ever Grand Final appearance, however, in front of their home supporters, the team was trounced by the Magpies and by the end of the 80 minutes, the scoreline read an astonishing 68-4 in what was the shock result of the week by far. Instead, the Storm in the Semi-Finals faced the Balmain Tigers at Leichhardt Oval in what proved to be the club's final game of their short 4-year history. The Storm attempted to trample a Tigers side who would eventually reach the Grand Final of the competition. With the side missing the likes of Kevin Proctor, Brian Lima, Ryan Tandy as well a host of other regulars, the team went in understrength, very much similar to the game against Western Suburbs and as such went down in a surprisingly tight- encounter, 24-18 with the Storm coming back in the 2nd half. The loss meant this was the Storm's final game as they were eliminated from the finals after a very successful home/away season. With the season over, the Melbourne Storm officially announced its intentions to pull out from the Central Coast after three seasons of both success and failure at the ever-expanding region. The Storm instead released to the media that it will now instead field a side in the NSW Cup based wholly and solely in Melbourne. As such, the team will be named exactly like the first-grade team, Melbourne Storm. As a replacement to the now-defunct Storm, Greg Florimo, the CEO of the North Sydney Bears and head of the expansion consortium of the Central Coast Bears, announced their intentions to field their own side based entirely out of the Central Coast. The side was originally to be known as the Central Coast Cubs (as a reference to the ties to the Bears) but the moniker was changed to Centurions after gaining support from the Newcastle Knights. Centurions (2010-2011) The Centurions acted as a feeder club to the NRL club Newcastle Knights. They started the season well with a 28-18 win against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs at the Crest Sports Complex in Round 1, but then had a horror run through the middle of the season with 13 losses and 4 wins. Some notable players in the squad are Chris Adams, Joel Edwards, Marvin Filipo, Sinbad Kali, Marvin Karawana, Siuatonga Likiliki, Keith Lulia, Peter Mata'utia, Shannon McDonnell, Constantine Mika, Kevin Naiqama, Kyle O'Donnell, Ben Rogers, Steve Southern, Ryan Stig, Zane Tetevano and Simon Williams. The Centurions coach Rip Taylor was selected to coach alongside Jason Taylor as the assistrant coach of the NSW Residents on the 7th of July 2010 against the Queensland residents before game III of the 2010 State of Origin series at ANZ Stadium. Centurions winger Kevin Naiqama was also in the NSW team and scored the game-breaking try. NSW went on to win the game. Centre Marvin Filipo was named the Centurions player of the year in 2010, and Steve Southern was named in 2011. Demise from NSW Cup During October 2011, it was announced that the Centurions wouldn't be continuing in 2012, with the team to be named the Newcastle Knights in the NSW Cup competition from then on. Club goes on (2012-current) While the Central Coast Centurions exited the NSW Cup however the side continued to play in the New South Wales Rugby League's S. G. Ball Cup and Harold Matthews Cup. In this time, the Sydney Roosters develop ties with Central Coast Rugby League and the club. In 2017 the Central Coast Centurions name was officially changed to Central Coast Roosters to highlight the strength of the arrangement. The Sydney Roosters maintain their own junior development teams by the same name in both competitions.http://www.roosters.com.au/team/central_coast_centur.htmlhttp://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?client=7-2168-19992-0-0&sID;=86970&news;_task=ARCHIVED&section;=86970http://www.centralcoastrugbyleague.com.au/2014-08-14-00-30-42/central- coast-roostershttp://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/central- coast/central-coast-rugby-league-adopts-sydney-roosters-nickname-and- colours/news-story/ae53424ebb16a8e4170c1af5135f1650 NSWRL Womens Premiers (2020) The Central Coast entered a respresentative team, as the Roosters, in the 2020 NSWRL Women's Premiership. The commencement of the competition was delayed until July, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. The team completed the seven match regular season in first place, with five wins, one draw and one bye. Remarkably, the draw came against Wentworthville Magpies who were winless wooden spooners. The Roosters' won a place in the Grand Final by defeating Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in the major semi-final at Campbelltown Stadium on September 12. The win was achieved with a field goal in golden- point extra-time. In the Grand Final at Bankwest Stadium on September 27, the Roosters scored the first two tries to take a 10 to nil lead. Their opponents, the North Sydney Bears responded with a try before Central Coast countered with their third try. The score was 14-4 at the break. North Sydney scored early in the second half, and that try was convetered. The Roosters managed to protect a four point lead until the last minute, when they received a penalty. The resulting goal saw the full time score: Central Coast 16, North Sydney 10. Members of the Central Coast Roosters received the two individual awards for the competition. Hannah Southwell (lock) was named Player of the Year. Yasmin Meakes (centre) was named Player of the Match for the Grand Final. Team captain Isabelle Kelly had previously played for Central Coast Club side Berkeley Vale Panthers in the NSWRL Women's Premiership.

According to its former editor, Roger Santodomingo, Noticiero Digital became popular after the government of Venezuela decided not to renew the broadcast license of cable television network RCTV, saying: \\"It has become [a] forum for comment that is virtually out of its own management's control because of its totally open nature.\\" As of June 2007, it had 45,000 registered users. Allegations by the Venezuelan government=Funding In May 2007, Noticiero Digital journalists, along with colleagues from RCTV and Globovision, were accused of being employed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to destabilize the Ch√°vez government. The accusations were initially made by television show host Mario Silva, who claimed that the U.S. government funded the writers; the \\"pro- government newspaper\\" Diario VEA later stated that the writers were receiving CIA funding, though they deny the accusations. Three days later Ch√°vez supporter and writer Eva Golinger showed records that she alleges show the journalists had received \\"money in 2003 under specialization courses and cultural exchanges financed by several international cooperation agencies of the United States\\". Golinger states that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been funding anti-Chavez activists opposed to President Ch√°vez to facilitate internet advocacy and destabilize Venezuela. The journalists deny receiving funding from the CIA. The International Freedom of Expression eXchange (IFEX) says \\"there is no evidence of links between international cooperation agencies and the CIA\\"; one of the accused journalists participated in a cultural exchange program called \\"Investigative Journalism\\" and another attended a program called \\"The role of social communication media in democracy\\". Editor resigns In May 2007, Venezuela's Attorney General accused Noticiero Digital of \\"attempting to instigate the assassination of the president and of receiving funding from the US State Department to destabilize the government\\". Santodomingo, the former editor, said that \\"the investigation has been prompted by his publication of an opinion poll in which the option of assassinating President Hugo Ch√°vez was offered as a possible response to the question: 'What is the way out of this crisis?' The option received 30 percent of the votes.\\" Santodomingo resigned in July 2007 after purported attacks and smears against him, and threats against his son, who was seven years old at the time. A message calling Santodomingo a \\"traitor to his country\\" was found in his son's school report card, leading Santodomingo to ask for protection for his son from the National Council for Children's Rights. A few days following his resignation, his car exploded and was destroyed outside his home. Forum posts In March 2010, Ch√°vez accused Noticiero Digital forums of falsely publishing that two of Ch√°vez's political allies had been assassinated. Calling the publication a crime, Ch√°vez called for restrictions on speech over the Internet, and for Venezuela's attorney general to take action against Noticiero Digital. Ch√°vez said: \\"The Internet can't be something free where anything can be done and said. No, every country has to impose its rules and regulations.\\" The magazine Variety reported that Noticiero Digital responded that the reports \\"were posted by unauthorized bloggers and suspect that they were planted by the government\\". According to Venezuela's El Universal, Noticiero Digital responded to the charges by saying that \\"messages in the forum are the opinions and expressions of its authors and not of the administrators or moderators\\" and that the two posts mentioning assassinations had been removed within hours and the users posting them permanently suspended. The government was accused in the media of attempting to regulate the internet and a Reporters Without Borders spokesperson said the Noticiero Digital case was a \\"pretext for the government to legitimize the regulation of [the Internet]\\". Ch√°vez inaugurated 24 community Internet centers, and, according to Business Week accused the opposition of spreading \\"lies about increased online censorship\\", saying \\"There‚Äôs a story around the world that I want to eliminate Internet, no, we want to transfer power and knowledge to the people through Internet. There have been counter revolutions and coups online. We need to use these tools to wage the Internet war, the online battle.\\" In support of Ch√°vez, \\"who questioned the news website Noticiero Digital for spreading false information about the alleged death of the Minister of Public Works and Housing, Diosdado Cabello, and pro-government TV anchor Mario Silva\\", the National Assembly of Venezuela appointed a committee to investigate webmasters who commit crimes, but denied plans to regulate the internet.

She used the nom-de-plume of Tian. Life G√ºnderrode, the oldest of six siblings, came from an aristocratic but poor family. In 1797 she entered a residence in Frankfurt am Main, run by a charitable foundation, in which poor unmarried noblewomen could live respectably while keeping an eye out for a suitable marriage partner.Duda, Sibylle. \\"Karoline von G√ºnderrode.\\" FemBio [lexicon/database of women's biographies, from a feminist perspective]. Translated by Joey Horsley. FemBio Frauen-Biographieforschung. Retrieved 2016-04-16. In Frankfurt her friends included the three siblings Kunigunde Brentano (later von Savigny; 1780-1863), Bettina von Arnim (n√©e Brentano) and Clemens Brentano.von Hoff, Dagmar (1995). \\"Aspects of Censorship in the Work of Karoline von G√ºnderrode.\\" Women in German Yearbook. vol. 11. p. 99‚Äì112; here p. 103. Accessible via JSTOR (registration required). G√ºnderrode was unable to come to terms with the prescribed feminine roles. In a letter to she wrote: \\"I've often had the unfeminine desire to throw myself into the wild chaos of battle and die. Why didn't I turn out to be a man! I have no feeling for feminine virtues, for a woman's happiness. Only that which is wild, great, shining appeals to me. There is an unfortunate but unalterable imbalance in my soul; and it will and must remain so, since I am a woman and have desires like a man without a man's strength. That's why I'm so vacillating and so out of harmony with myself‚Ä¶.\\"As quoted in Duda, \\"Karoline von G√ºnderrode,\\" FemBio; translation from the German. Karoline suffered from a nervously induced melancholy and had an unpredictable temperament that alienated some. While attending a social event, G√ºnderrode met the legal scholar Friedrich Carl von Savigny and fell in love with him. Sometime later, she reached the point of hoping for a proposal of marriage, but Savigny decided instead to marry her less intellectual friend Kunigunde Brentano. After what she saw as Savigny's betrayal, G√ºnderrode worked on her art as a poet, aiming to unite life and writing. She wrote works with strong heroic women in a central role, such as Hildegun und Nikator and Mora. Through her writing she criticized the ideals of the bourgeois society at the time and its traditional gender roles. In 1804, G√ºnderrode met the philologist and archeologist Georg Friedrich Creuzer. Although he was married, they developed a relationship. Creuzer asked his wife for a divorce, which she agreed to, but Creuzer, who suffered depression from his secret relationship with G√ºnderrode, and anxiety about the public scandal of a divorce, postponed the decision. He sought advice from his friends and colleagues, who suggested he should forget G√ºnderrode, as she would never be a suitable wife. In the midst of the unresolved situation, he became ill; finally, through a friend, he sent a letter to G√ºnderrode ending the relationship. Upon receiving the news, G√ºnderrode killed herself with a dagger on the banks of the river Rhine at Winkel. G√ºnderrode and Heinrich von Kleist were the two central characters in Kein Ort. Nirgends, a novel by Christa Wolf published in 1979. This recounts a fictional meeting between G√ºnderrode and Kleist in which the two escape the empty chatter of a tea party by taking a long walk.

Early life John Savile was born in 1556, the son of Sir Robert Savile of Barkston, Lincolnshire (d. 1585), by his wife Anne Hussey (d. 1562), sister of John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford, and widow of Sir Richard Thimelby. His father was the illegitimate son of Sir Henry Savile of Thornhill in the West Riding of Yorkshire and had served as sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1573. Political career He entered parliament as member for Lincoln in 1586, and he served as sheriff of that county in 1590. On 3 October 1597 he was elected knight of the shire for the county of York, for which he was again returned in 1614. In the latter Parliament he distinguished himself by his opposition to the king, and was consequently struck off the commission of the peace at the close of the session. cites: Gardiner, ii. 249. He was also custos rotulorum for the West Riding of Yorkshire, but is said to have made \\"use of his authority to satisfy his own ends\\". In 1615 he was removed from the office and Thomas Wentworth (afterwards Earl of Strafford) appointed in his place. There had long been bitter rivalry between the Saviles and the Wentworths, and they soon \\"imported their county quarrels into public affairs\\". cites: Ranke, ii. 202‚Äì3. According to Clarendon, Wentworth's \\"first inclinations and addresses to the court were only to establish his greatness in the country where he apprehended some acts of power from the old Lord Savile, who had been his rival always there, and of late had strengthened himself by being made a privy councillor and an [ 373 ] officer at court\\"; cites: Clarendon Rebellion, i. 341. and he \\"rested not until he had bereaved him of all power and place in court, and so sent him down a most abject, disconsolate old man to his country\\". Upon his ejection from the office of custos rotulorum, Savile began intriguing with the Duke of Buckingham, whom in September 1617 he induced to write to Wentworth demanding his resignation of the office. Wentworth, however, remonstrated, and, being powerfully supported in the county, carried his point. Buckingham acknowledged that he had been misled by Savile. cites: cf. Strafford Letters, passim; Fortescue Papers, Camden Soc., pp. 24, 27; and Browning, Life of Strafford, 1892, pp. 25, &c.; On 19 January 1624 Savile was again elected for Yorkshire, his colleague being his son Thomas; but in 1625 Wentworth and Lord Fairfax carried the election against him. This was the occasion of the famous dispute in parliament which first brought Wentworth and Eliot into collision. Savile accused the sheriff of having interrupted the polling when it was going against Wentworth, who was his friend. After a heated debate, in which Wentworth broke the rules of the house, and Eliot denounced him as Catiline, the election was declared void. cites: Gardiner, v. 349‚Äì51; Forster, Eliot, i. 160. At the by-election Wentworth was again elected; but on 16 Jananuary 1625‚Äì6, in a new parliament, Savile once more carried the seat, Wentworth having been made sheriff to prevent his contesting it. Savile was now high in Buckingham's favour; in July 1626 he was again appointed custos rotulorum in Wentworth's place. Soon afterwards he was sworn of the Privy Council for his services in parliament, and in December was placed on a commission to inquire into abuses in the navy. In the following April his exertions secured the success of the forced loan in Yorkshire, cites: Gardiner, vi. 158. and soon after, through Buckingham's influence, he succeeded Sir John Suckling as comptroller of the household. In May he was placed on a commission to inquire into offices existing and fees taken in Elizabeth's reign. In July he was appointed receiver of the revenues from recusants in the north, and a year later he was created Baron Savile of Pontefract, on the same day (21 July) that Wentworth was raised to the peerage. He held the office of comptroller till his death, aged 74, on 31 August 1630, so that Clarendon's reference to him as an \\"abject, disconsolate old man\\" is exaggerated. He was buried in Batley church, Yorkshire, where a monument, with an inflated inscription (printed by Whitaker), was raised to his memory by his daughter, Anne Leigh. Domestic life About 1590 Savile built Howley Hall in Batley, which he made his seat; Camden described it as \\"√¶des elegantissimas\\", and its ruins were still extant in 1900. Tradition says that Rubens visited him there, and painted for him a view of Pontefract. Savile married, first, Catherine, daughter of Charles, lord Willoughby of Parham, by whom he had no issue; secondly, on 20 November 1586, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward, and sister of Sir Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland. By her he had five sons and three daughters; he was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Thomas Savile, Earl of Sussex. NotesReferences * The entry cites: **Cal.

With the resurrection of Jesus, it is the climax of Salvation History in Christian faith Salvation history () seeks to understand the personal redemptive activity of God within human history in order to effect his eternal saving intentions.\\"Paul and Salvation History\\", in Justification and Variegated Nomism; Volume 2 ‚Äì The Paradoxes of Paul, eds. D. A. Carson, Mark A. Seifrid, and Peter T. O'Brien (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker, 2004), p. 297. This approach to history is found in parts of the Old Testament written around the sixth century BC, such as Deutero-Isaiah and some of the Psalms. In Deutero- Isaiah, for example, Yahweh is portrayed as causing the fall of the Neo- Babylonian Empire at the hands of Cyrus the Great and the Persians, with the aim of restoring his exiled people to their land.Exile and Restoration: A Study of Hebrew Thought of the Sixth Century BC, Peter R. Ackroyd (London: SCM Press, 1968), pp. 130‚Äì133. The salvation history approach was adopted and deployed by Christians, beginning with Paul in his epistles. He taught a dialectical theology wherein believers were caught between the \\"already\\" of Christ's death and resurrection, and the \\"not yet\\" of the coming Parousia (or Christ's return to Earth at the end of human history). He sought to explain the Christ's mystery through the lens of the history of the Hebrew scriptures, for example, by drawing parallels and contrasts between Adam's disobedience and Christ's faithfulness on the cross. In the context of Christian theology, this approach reads the books of the Bible as a continuous history. It understands events such as the fall at the beginning of history (Book of Genesis), the covenants established between God and Noah, Abraham, and Moses, the establishment of David's dynasty in the holy city of Jerusalem, etc., as seminal moments in the history of humankind and its relationship to God, namely, as necessary events preparing for the salvation of all by Christ's crucifixion and resurrection.

According to Microsoft, \\"The basic goal for these requirements is that the operating system, devices, and end users cannot detect the presence of the following: ISA slots or devices; legacy floppy disk controller (FDC); and PS/2, serial, parallel, and game ports.\\" The legacy ports are usually replaced with Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports. A USB adapter may be used if an older device must be connected to a PC lacking these ports. According to the 2001 edition of Microsoft's PC System Design Guide, a legacy-free PC must be able to boot from a USB device. Doing away with older, usually more bulky ports and devices allows a legacy-free PC to be much more compact than earlier systems and many fall into the nettop or All in One form factor. Netbooks and Ultrabooks could also be considered a portable form of a legacy-free PC. Legacy-free PCs can be more difficult to upgrade than a traditional beige box PC, and are more typically expected to be replaced completely when they become obsolete. Many legacy-free PCs include modern devices that may be used to replace ones omitted, such as a memory card reader replacing the floppy drive. As the first decade of the 21st century progressed, the legacy-free PC went mainstream, with legacy ports removed from commonly available computer systems in all form factors. However, the PS/2 keyboard connector still retains some use, as it can offer some uses (e.g. implementation of n-key rollover) not offered by USB. History=Late 1990s Apple's iMac G3 was the first example of a legacy-free PC drawing much criticism for its lack of legacy peripherals such as a floppy drive and Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) connector. However, its success popularized USB itself. From November 1999 to July 2000, Dell's WebPC was an early less- successful Wintel legacy-free PC. 2000s More legacy-free PCs were introduced around 2000 after the prevalence of USB and broadband internet made many of the older ports and devices obsolete. They largely took the form of low-end, consumer systems with the motivation of making computers less expensive, easier to use, and more stable and manageable. The Dell Studio Hybrid, Asus Eee Box and MSI Wind PC are examples of later, more-successful Intel-based legacy-free PCs. Apple introduced the Apple Modem on October 12, 2005 and removed the internal 56K modem on new computers. The MacBook Air, introduced on January 29, 2008, also omits a built-in SuperDrive and wired Ethernet connectivity that was available on all other Mac computers sold at the time. The SuperDrive would later be removed from all Macs by the end of 2016, while wired Ethernet would later be removed from all MacBook models. 2010s The relaunched MacBook in 2015 dropped features such as the MagSafe charging port and the Secure Digital (SD) memory card reader. It only kept two types of ports: a 3.5mm audio jack and a USB 3.1 Type-C port. This configuration later found its way in the MacBook Pro in 2016, the only difference being that two or four Thunderbolt 3 ports were included instead of just one. In addition, all MacBook Pro except for the entry-level model replaced the function keys with a Touch Bar. These changes led to criticism because many users utilised the features that Apple had removed.

It was published by Vantage Press in 2008. Evacuees used the Superdome in New Orleans as a refuge of last resort beginning the day before Hurricane Katrina hit landfall on August 29, 2005. The book details the author's experiences as a California tourist who was unable to evacuate New Orleans as the Airport, Amtrak, and Greyhound Bus station all closed a day prior to the mandatory evacuation and two days prior to the Category 3 storm hitting landfall. The book deals with the supportive as well as the unruly behavior by individuals within the confines of the Superdome, as well as concentrating on the author's views on the power of fear, Group Think, and rumor to control human behavior. The unsanitary conditions within the Superdome are described fully. The author also talks of being smuggled out of the Superdome after 3 days with a group of international visitors, where they experience more challenges to their survival. Discussion about future ways emergency personnel and disaster relief organizations may better offer assistance to those in need are spelled out. Finally the author, Paul Harris discusses where the media was accurate and inaccurate in what it reported going on inside the Superdome. Rumors were rampant about rapes and murders within the stadium of the New Orleans Saints, but weeks later authorities were unable to verify any of these reports, and attributed these to miscommunication and simply passing on hearsay.

Purpose The Malaysia Law Reform Committee was set up in December 2009. Its primary purpose was to re- study all the laws for their relevance and influence on the daily lives and activities of Malaysians with a view to making the necessary recommendations to the government for reform. The revision of the country's laws would be considered on such criteria as their relevance to everyday life and their discernible benefits to the public and the communities who reside and work in the country. The Malaysia Law Reform Committee is chaired by Liew Vui Keong, the Deputy Minister of Law Parliamentary Affairs in the Prime Minister's Department. He has announced that among its first tasks will be a study of archaic business and commercial laws that impede business growth and development. This announcement followed the recommendation made by the Prime Minister Najib Razak that suggested that the MLRC make its study of the country's archaic business-related laws a top priority. Priority will be given to the updating of commercial laws, development laws and laws relating to trade and commerce. Laws that could create problems to the business affairs of the country will undergo an appraisal for reform. The Government is very concerned with the people's views and opinions on laws that hinder business growth, and will aim to secure the private sector‚Äôs crucial input for the MLRC‚Äôs action. Towards this end the MLRC will review and update such laws and work together with other government agencies, as well as the special task force to facilitate business (Pemudah) in carrying out the initiative. The Cabinet is of a similar view on archaic laws that involve land ownership that to date has been proven a hindrance and problematic to business. The Prime Minister, Datuk VK Liew, said, ‚ÄúI will be taking up this massive task through discussions with the various government agencies that deal with these commercial laws, bringing to our attention their obsolescence. These archaic laws don‚Äôt augur well for business development.‚Äù He also said, ‚ÄúThe MLRC will be also holding dialogues and discussions with a cross section of business communities for their collective views and suggestions for improved trading, general commerce and other business related activities.‚Äù Preliminary findings The Malaysia Law Reform Committee has reported that the total number of principal Acts of Parliament that exist under the Laws of Malaysia Series is 703. These laws, which date back to the country's pre-independence or colonial period, have undergone some degree of review since 1968, but not for their content and relevance.

Mateus arrived at Goa in 1512, and traveled to Portugal in 1514, from where he returned with a Portuguese embassy, along with Francisco √Ålvares. The Portuguese only understood the nature of his mission after they arrived in Ethiopia in 1520, shortly after Mateus' death, a fact that complicated their mission to the new Ethiopian Emperor.Beckingham and Huntingford, translators, Prester John, p.307; paraphrasing the account of Gaspar Correa. Apparently Francisco √Ålvares never learned this, for in his narrative he repeats without explanation Lebna Dengel's claim that Mattheus lacked the authority to represent him (e.g., p. 283).  Mateus embassy to Portugal  Mateus was dispatched by regent queen Eleni, following the arrival of two Portuguese at Ethiopia in search of P√™ro da Covilh√£ in 1508. Those envoys, including priest Jo√£o Gomes, Jo√£o Sanches, and Sid Mohammed were sent by Trist√£o da Cunha in 1506. Having failed to cross Malindi, they returned to Socotra, from where Afonso de Albuquerque managed to land them in Filuk, arriving in Shewa, Ethiopia.J. J. Hespeler-Boultbee, \\"A Story in Stones: Portugal's Influence on Culture and Architecture in the Highlands of Ethiopia 1493-1634\\", p.178, CCB Publishing, 2006, They were killed or disappeared in the returning travel. Mateus, of Armenian origin, was sent to the Portuguese in India transporting a pious letter from Eleni to king Manuel I of Portugal and a piece of the True Cross. He traveled with his wife, brother-in-law, and servants.Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius (1977). Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415‚Äì1580, p.352. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. Albuquerque, Braz de (1774). Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque. Lisbon: Na Regia Officina Typografica. Available in English as The Commentaries of the Great Afonso Dalboquerque, Second Viceroy of India. Laurier Books Ltd. /AES 2000. After being robbed in Zaila and detained in Bijapur, Mateus arrived at Dabul, and was received in Goa in December 1512 with great honour by Portuguese governor Afonso de Albuquerque, as a long sought \\"Prester John\\" envoy. His arrival was announced by king Manuel I of Portugal to Pope Leo X in 1513. Although Mateus faced the distrust of some of Albuquerque's rivals, who tried to prove he was some impostor or Muslim spy, he was sent by Albuquerque to Cananor, and from there to Portugal. Mateus arrived in Lisbon in February 1514. There, his reports, the letter by queen Eleni and the piece of the cross were much admired by the king and his entourage.Francis Millet Rogers, \\"The quest for Eastern Christians: travels and rumor in the Age of Discovery\\", p. 134, U of Minnesota Press, 1962, The king is described as having wept with joy at their view. While Mateus was in Portugal, Albuquerque advanced in an attempt to take Aden with his expedition into the Red Sea. The desire of turning near-by Massawa into a Portuguese base, may have been influenced by Mateus' reports. Dami√£o de G√≥is translated into Latin a Portuguese opuscle on the Ethiopian embassy of Mateus, which also included the famous \\"Letter of Prester John\\" written by the Ethiopian Queen Eleni (1509) and a \\"Confessio illorum fidei\\". Return to Ethiopia with Portuguese embassy In 1515 King Manuel answered with an embassy to accompany Mateus to Ethiopia. The mission was headed by old Duarte Galv√£o and included Father Francisco √Ålvares, with rich gifts for the king of Ethiopia. They sailed from Lisbon to Goa on 7 April 1515, with the new governor to be, Lopo Soares de Albergaria. From Goa, a fleet departed for the Red Sea trying to land the ambassadors in February 1517, joined by Italian explorer Andrea Corsali. Corsali wrote several letters about the travel, stating that they stopped near Socotra, and proceeded to Aden. Given bad weather and the refusal of Albergaria to go further, getting no closer than the Dahlak Archipelago, they proceeded to Massawa. Mateus had some contacts in Massawa, but after weeks of stalling, old ambassador Duarte Galv√£o died and the mission was cancelled. √Ålvares and Mattheus were forced to wait until the arrival of Soares' replacement, Diogo Lopes de Sequeira, who successfully sent the embassy on, with D.Rodrigo de Lima replacing Duarte Galv√£o. The party at last reached Massawa on April 9, 1520, and reached the court of Lebna Dengel. There, √Ålvares befriended several Europeans who had gained the favor of the Emperor, which included P√™ro da Covilh√£ and Nicolao Branceleon. √Ålvares' party remained six years in Ethiopia, returning to Lisbon in either 1526 or 1527.

Pakistan has simultaneously received allegations of harbouring and aiding terrorists and commendation for its anti-terror efforts. Since 2001, the country has also hosted millions of Afghan refugees who fled the war in Afghanistan. Major developments The Saudi born Zayn al-Abidn Muhammed Hasayn Abu Zubaydah, was arrested by Pakistani officials during a series of joint U.S. and Pakistan raids during the week of 23 March 2002. During the raid, the suspect was shot three times while trying to escape capture by military personnel. Zubaydah is said to be a high-ranking al-Qaeda official with the title of operations chief and in charge of running al-Qaeda training camps. Later that year on 11 September 2002, Ramzi bin al-Shibh was arrested in Pakistan after a three-hour gunfight with police forces. Bin al- Shibh is known to have shared a room with Mohamed Atta in Hamburg, Germany and to be a financial backer of al-Qaeda operations. It is said Ramzi bin al-Shibh was supposed to be another hijacker in September 11 attacks, however the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services rejected his visa application three times, leaving him to the role of financier. The trail of money transferred by bin al-Shibh from Germany to the United States links both Mohammad Atta and Zacarias Moussaoui. On 1 March 2003, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was arrested during CIA-led raids on the suburb of Rawalpindi, nine miles outside of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. Mohammed at the time of his capture was the third highest-ranking official in al-Qaeda and had been directly in charge of the planning for the 11 September attacks. Other events Mohammed has been linked to include: ordering the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, the USS Cole bombing, Richard Reid's attempt to blow up a civilian airliner with a shoe bomb, and the terrorist attack at the El Ghriba synagogue in Djerba, Tunisia. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed has described himself as the head of the al-Qaeda military committee. Amidst all this, in 2006, Pakistan was accused by NATO commanding officers of aiding and abetting the Taliban in Afghanistan; but NATO later admitted that there was no known evidence against the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) or Pakistani government of sponsoring terrorism. The Afghan government also accuses the ISI of providing help to militants, including protection to the Mullah Dadullah, Taliban's senior military commander killed in 2007, a charge denied by the Pakistani government.Taliban military leader killed by Nato forces Belfast Telegraph, 14 May 2007. India, meanwhile continues to accuse Pakistan's ISI of planning several terrorist attacks in Kashmir and elsewhere in the Indian republic, including the 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings, which Pakistan alleges is due to \\"homegrown\\" insurgencies. Many other countries like Afghanistan and the UK have also accused Pakistan of State-sponsored terrorism and financing terrorism. The upswing in American military activity in Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan corresponded with a great increase in American military aid to the Pakistan government. In the three years before the attacks of 11 September, Pakistan received approximately $9 million in American military aid. In the three years after, the number increased to $4.2 billion, making it the country with the maximum funding post 9/11. Such a huge inflow of funds has raised concerns that these funds were given without any accountability, as the end uses not being documented, and that large portions were used to suppress civilians' human rights and to purchase weapons to contain domestic problems like the Balochistan unrest.Billions in Aid, With No Accountability Center for Public Integrity Posted: 31 May 2007An alliance of convenience By Burhanuddin Hasan The News International, Pakistan In December 2016, The Spectator reported that Pakistan is winning its war on terror. The article reported the major steps taken by the Nawaz Sharif, during his third term as the Prime Minister of Pakistan, which has resulted in an overall drop in violence. The Guardian reported that in 2016, Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India referred to Pakistan as the \\"mothership of terrorism\\", as part of a reprised campaign to increase international pressure on Pakistan for allegedly harboring and supporting militant groups. In August 2017, The Guardian reported that as part of a new US strategy in Afghanistan by the Trump administration, more pressure was to be put on Pakistan over alleged support for insurgent groups, with President Trump saying in a televised statement that \\"we can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond.\\" The new strategy was supported by Afghan government officials, a spokesman for the Afghan president said that \\"this is the first time the US government is coming with a very clear-cut message to Pakistan to either stop what you're doing or face the negative consequences.\\" Pakistani security officials rejected the statements, stating, \\"They are shifting blame to Pakistan\\" and \\"Pakistan itself is the victim of terrorism. We are fighting militants and have conducted many ground and aerial operations and destroyed their sanctuaries. We want to eradicate them physically and ideologically.\\". As part of a regional approach, Trump said he would encourage India to play more of a role (whom are already providing economic and humanitarian aid to Afghanistan), former officials and analysts have pointed out that the fear of a greater Indian presence in Afghanistan was the justification used by Pakistan's military and intelligence leaders to maintain backing for Afghan militants, as a buffer against Indian influence. Waziristan With the logistics and air support of the United States, the Pakistani Army captured or killed numerous al-Qaeda operatives such as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Training ground for European militants In 2009, a politically unstable Pakistan emerged as a new global hub for anti-West militancy, but, because of the constant threat of US attacks, recruits were reportedly more likely to spend their time under instruction and in training than carrying out assertive action. In his report on the matter, focusing on an alarming influx of European extremists, Reuters security correspondent William Maclean wrote, He added that the matter was likely to surface in a meeting on 6 May 2009 between United States President Barack Obama, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the first-mentioned looking to bring an end to the employment of Pakistan's tribal zones as a launching pad for al Qaeda activity around the world.Maclean 2009.

It is owned and operated by EDP Renewables North America. The facility currently has six operational phases, with 414 turbines, and is a prominent feature on both sides of Interstate 65 in western Indiana.  Phase I  Phase I consists of 121 Vestas V82-1.65 MW wind turbines, for a total nameplate capacity of 199.65 MW. Groundbreaking ceremonies occurred on April 14, 2009. Phase I became operational in October, 2009. Horizon built a substation next to an existing AEP substation which was already within the wind farm site area. This allowed the wind farm to connect to the power grid without the need to build lengthy new transmission line at a cost of $1 million per mile.  Phase II  Meadow Lake II Wind Farm has an installed capacity of 99 MW ‚Äì enough to power approximately 27,000 average Indiana homes with clean energy each year. The wind farm, which consists of 66 Acciona AWs-1.5 MW turbines, achieved commercial operation in June 2010.  Phase III  Meadow Lake III Wind Farm has an installed capacity of 103.5 MW ‚Äì enough to power approximately 28,000 average Indiana homes with clean energy each year. The wind farm, which consists of 69 GE Energy SLE-1.5 MW turbines, achieved commercial operation in October 2010.  Phase IV  Meadow Lake IV Wind Farm has an installed capacity of 98.7 MW ‚Äì enough to power approximately 27,000 average Indiana homes with clean energy each year. The wind farm, which achieved commercial operation in October 2010, consists of 47 Suzlon S88-2.1 MW turbines.  Phases V and VI  Meadow Lake V and VI have installed capacities of 100 MW and 200.4 MW, respectively. Phase V came fully online in 2018 and consists of 50 Vestas V110-2.0 MW turbines. Phase VI will come fully online in 2019 and consist of 61 turbines (12 Vestas V110-2.0 MW wind turbines and 49 Vestas V136-3.6 MW) that will include some of the tallest and most powerful in the state.  Future expansion  In early 2010, an EDP Renewables representative and local renewable energy advocates scouted the Meadow Lake project area for a location to build a visitor center. One possibility was an unused building near the intersection of I-65 and US-231 (), near where a wind turbine will be installed within the next year.  Environmental impact  At a planned ultimate nameplate capacity of 1000 MW, EDP Renewables North America claims that Meadow Lake would be one of the largest wind farms in the world. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that such facilities would generate enough electricity to power about 250,000 homes, annually saving 1,684 million gallons of water and eliminating 3.1 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Horizon further estimates that Phases I and II should eliminate just under one million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. Phase I spreads over a ten by six mile area since large wind turbines must be spaced at least 5 to 10 rotor diameters apart to avoid wind shadowing. Most of the land between turbines remains productive farmland; only about of farmland have been taken out of production by the 121 turbines.

It was centred around the administrative centre of Speyer and roughly covered the former Roman administrative area of Civitas Nemetum, which is today the south-eastern portion of the Palatinate region between the Rhine river, the Palatinate Forest range, and some smaller parts of northern Alsace. The Speyergau, together with the neighbouring Wormsgau and Nahegau, was part of the major possessions held by the Salian dynasty of German kings and Holy Roman Emperors.Geschichte der Stadt Speyer, Vol. 1, 1982, Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart, Counts of Speyergau Some renowned counts of Speyergau were: # Werner V (c. 899 - c. 935), the first definite progenitor of the Salian Dynasty, also count of Nahegau and Wormsgau, member of the house of Conradines. # Conrad the Red (X 955), son of Werner V, also count of Nahegau, Wormsgau and Niddagau, count in Franconia, duke of Lorraine, ‚àû around 947 Liutgard of Saxony (born 931, died 953), daughter of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor #Otto of Worms (died 1004), only son of Conrad the Red, also count of Nahegau, Wormsgau, Elsenzgau, Kraichgau, Enggau, Pfinzgau and Ufgau, duke of Carinthia #Conrad II the younger, (born probably 1003, died 1039), grandson of Otto I, also count of Nahegau, Wormsgau, duke of Carinthia (1036-1039) Rural reeves (Landvogt) of Speyergau * Georg I. von Geroldseck, count of Veldenz, 1310/15 * Otto V. von Ochsenstein, died 1327, 1291/1302 Landvogt of Ortenau, 1315/27 Landvogt of Alsace, 1318 Landvogt of Speyergau * Otto VI. von Ochsenstein, Landvogt of Alsace and Speyergau, died before 1377 References Category:Speyer Category:Carolingian counties Category:Former states and territories of Rhineland-Palatinate ","title":"Speyergau"},{"id":"26561556","text":"Carlos Miguel may refer to: * Carlos Miguel da Silva J√∫nior (born 1972), Brazilian footballer * Carlos Miguel (fencer) (1892‚Äì1974), Spanish fencer * Carlos Miguel (politician) (born 1957), Portuguese lawyer and politician ","title":"Carlos Miguel"},{"id":"26561566","text":"William Ross, 12th Lord Ross (c.1656 - 15 March 1738), was a Scottish nobleman, soldier and politician. Origins Ross was born in about 1656. He was the son and heir of George Ross, 11th Lord Ross, who died in 1682, by Grizel, daughter of William Cochrane, 1st Earl of Dundonald. The Rosses of Halkhead, or Hawkhead, in Renfrewshire, were a Lowland family, not apparently related to the Earls of Ross or the Highland family of Ross of Balnagown.Sir James Balfour Paul, The Scots Peerage, Volume VII Military career Ross had commissions as lieutenant (27 September 1678) and captain (4 September 1680) in Lord Home's troop of horse, and as captain (26 December 1682) and major (4 August 1686) in Claverhouse's regiment of horse, the last of which, however, he shortly afterwards resigned. In 1685, he was wounded in an action during the pursuit of the Earl of Argyll. He appears to have been a personal friend of Claverhouse, having been a witness at his wedding in 1684, and later excused himself from joining the army raised against his old friend and commander by pleading the pressure of his Parliamentary duties. Political career In 1689 Ross was present at the first Parliament of King William and was chosen by the Convention of Estates to go to London to give the King an account of their proceedings. He was also appointed as a commissioner to consider the question of union with England. On 18 May 1689, he was appointed a member of the Privy Council. Disaffected perhaps by the lack of reward for his services, Ross became closely involved with the Earl of Annandale in the dissident \\"Club\\" of Sir James Montgomerie of Skelmorlie.P.A.Hopkins, Sir James Montgomerie of Skelmorlie, in The Stuart Court in Exile and the Jacobites (ed. Cruickshanks and Corp, Hambledon Press, 1995), chapter 3 However, he recanted and, although sent to the Tower of London in July 1690, was eventually released without prosecution. On 29 February 1704 he was appointed Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. A later attempt in about 1707 to secure for himself the ancient Earldom of Ross aroused the genealogical indignation of the Earl of Cromartie, who memorably wrote that Ross had no more relation to the old Earls of Ross \\"than the miller of Carstairs has to the Prince of Parma\\". Ross died at Edinburgh on 15 March 1738. Family Ross married no fewer than four times: *first (7 February 1679) to Agnes, daughter and heiress of Sir John Wilkie of Fouldean *secondly to Margaret, daughter of Lord Wharton (and widow of Major Dunch and Sir Thomas Sulyarde) *thirdly to Anne, daughter of John Hay, 2nd Marquess of Tweeddale *fourthly (contract 16 June 1731) to Henrietta, daughter of Sir Francis Scott of Thirlestane (who survived him and died on 16 January 1750). By his first wife, Lord Ross had: *George Ross, 13th Lord Ross *John, who was born on 13 July 1687 but died young *Euphame (10 November 1684-1729), who married first William Boyd, 3rd Earl of Kilmarnock and secondly (after 1717) John Murray *Mary (born 18 July 1687), who married (contract 26 June 1710) John Murray, 1st Duke of Atholl *Grizel, who married (in or before 1715) Sir James Lockhart of Carstairs and died in November 1749.
