The property master is on staff during preproduction, develops the stylistic concept of the physical production, then continues on as a member of the physical shooting/production crew. A person responsible for purchasing the props can be called a props buyer or production buyer.  Role  During preproduction, the props master develops a props breakdown. This is essentially mapping out the logical progression of each prop throughout the story. In film and television productions the props master maintains the logical progression while shooting by ensuring the props are positioned in their correct logical place for each scene according to the props breakdown. If the logical progression of a prop changes during shooting, the props breakdown is revised to reflect the change. This job description varies somewhat from country to country. In the United States, food styling, weapons and animals are often directly or indirectly within the property master's domain. The job is a collaboration with the director, production designer, cameraman, set decorator and other members of the production to physically express their stylistic and aesthetic requirements. They maintain their own budget. There are physical aspects of productions that are managed by specialists other than the property master, for example costume designers are responsible for the actors' dress, and weapons masters are responsible for any weapons (firearms, blades, staff-based or otherwise). In professional theatre, the property master is responsible for the setup and organization of the props. The property master is directed by the director.

During World War II, his career was interrupted by service with the United States Marine Corps. At war's end, he returned as an assistant trainer until 1950, when he set up his own stable to take on the training of horses for various owners. He got his big break when Liz Whitney Tippett hired him to condition her Llangollen Farm racing stable. On June 10, 1953, the then forty- year-old Whittingham saddled his first stakes winner when Liz Person's Porterhouse won the National Stallion Stakes. The colt would go on to earn that year's U.S. Two-year-old colt honors.The Bloodhorse.com Champion's history charts Records and champions Over his 49 years as a head trainer, Whittingham had 252 stakes wins and became the all-time leading trainer at both Hollywood Park Racetrack and Santa Anita Park.

As Alice Freeman, she was President of Wellesley College from 1881 to 1887, when she left to marry the Harvard professor George Herbert Palmer. From 1892 to 1895 she was Dean of Women at the newly founded University of Chicago. She was an advocate for college education for women, improving their opportunities to attend college through improved college preparation, sponsorship, public lectures, and in her role in many education organizations. She was co-founder and president of the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, which later became the American Association of University Women. She was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. She called for women to attain a college education so that if they needed to support themselves, they would have the necessary skills to do so. An independent and effective person, unique for her time, was the model New Woman of the 19th century. Early life Alice Elvira Freeman was born in Colesville, New York, was the eldest child of four children of Elizabeth Josephine Higley and James Warren Freeman. From her father, she acquired her \\"moral beauty\\", as well as her height and red highlights in her hair. Palmer was particularly close to her mother during her childhood, partly because her mother was only 17 years-of-age when she was born, and also because of their shared responsibility caring for her younger siblings and performing household duties. Elizabeth was an advocate for children and women's rights and health care, as well as the temperance movement. Her father, a farmer in her early years, was interested in making direct changes to people's lives, rather than through reform movements, and shared his interest in education and the sciences with his daughter. Charles Wilson Knapp, View in the Susquehanna Valley Both of her parents came from early settlers and major landholders of the Susquehanna Valley in southern New York. They had interests in farming and lumber. Alice Freeman Palmer, age five, about 1860 As the age of three, she taught herself to read and developed what became a lifelong enjoyment of reading aloud. Her father enrolled in Albany Medical School in 1861 and graduated in 1864, which created an added burden on her mother to manage the farm when her father was away. During that time she attended a rural district school. After his return, when she was six- years old, the family moved into a rented house in Windsor, New York and her father established a medical practice in the town. When she was ten, she began attending the co-educational Windsor Academy in her hometown. She met Thomas Barclay, a student at Yale University, in her hometown when he worked as a teacher to pay off his college expenses. He encouraged her intellectual curiosity and served as her mentor. They became close and were engaged when she was 14 years of age, but she broke off the engagement in February 1871. She was described as \\"an eager, ambitious student, determined by the very forces of her nature towards the getting of knowledge and the building of a symmetrical character.\\" Palmer won awards for her compositions and performance at regional oratorical contents. She was inspired by a lecture given by Anna Elizabeth Dickinson and engaged in community service, giving away some of her savings for college, at a time when she did not have a winter coat. She became a member of the Presbyterian Church in her final year at the academy, both because it was an expected action and as an expression of her personal commitment. Biographer Ruth Birgitta Anderson Bordin suggests that Palmer was influenced to gain a college education due to her relationship with Barclay, having been inspired by orator Anna Dickinson, and having experienced the financial uncertainty of her family. Palmer later said that attainment of a college education is \\"life insurance for a girl\\", should she need to provide for herself financially. Her parents did not have the financial capacity to send more than one child, a son, to college. Therefore, they agree to help with the financing with the stipulation that Palmer provide financial support so that her brother and perhaps other siblings could go to college. Education Alice Freeman Palmer, 1876, while at University of Michigan In 1870, the University of Michigan began enrolling women. Palmer took an entrance examination in 1872 at the University of Michigan, at the time was the largest university in the country, and had been found to have deficiency in some areas. She made a strong impression on James B. Angell, the president and registrar of the university. She was admitted under the condition that she make up the missing course content, which she did before her sophomore year. James invested in a speculative mining endeavor in 1873 and due to its failure, he lost his farm and possessions. and asked for Palmer to return home. Instead, with the help of her professors, she acquired a Greek and Latin language teaching position at Ottawa, Illinois. Under the arrangement, she was allowed to continue her studies as a member of the Junior class. In addition to supporting, she was self-supporting from that point further. Palmer became the first of her class and was a member of the Students' Christian Association. She spoke at her commencement in 1876 about The Conflict Between Science and Poetry. Career =Early years= After she graduated from the University of Michigan, she taught at a private boarding school in Wisconsin in Geneva for one school year. Beginning in 1877, she was the principal of the high school at East Saginaw, Michigan. Her father declared bankruptcy in 1877 and Alice assumed his debts and moved the family to Saginaw to a rented house that was paid for with her principal's salary and the income that her mother made from boarders. Her father established a practice that ultimately became successful in the city. She began to suffer poor health, in part due to how hard she had worked since she was 19 years of age. =Wellesley College= Evelyn Beatrice Longman, Bust of Alice Freeman Palmer, 1920, Hall of Fame for Great Americans Henry Fowle Durant, the founder of Wellesley College, made Palmer three offers to teach at the college, first in mathematics, and then Greek. Due to her sister's dire health condition, she did not accept these offers. She accepted the third professorship offer to teach history in 1879. Later that same year, her younger sister Estelle became ill and died. In October 1881, she was named acting president of Wellesley. When Durant died, Palmer, at 26 years old, was elected president of the college. She was the first woman to be the head of a nationally known college. Palmer improved the academic program at Wellesley. Palmer \\"transformed the fledgling school from one devoted to Christian domesticity into one of the nation's premier colleges for women.\\" She improved the academic curriculum, raised the standards for admission to the school, established 15 \\"feeder schools\\" for pre-college preparation, and recruited distinguished faculty members. She improved the image of the educated woman, against the prevailing opinion that education would affect a woman's femininity or health. The \\"cottage system\\" that she implemented brought faculty and students together in small homes. She was personally engaging with students and staff and the people that were the closest to her gave her the appreciative nickname \\"The Princess\\". During the period as president, she was quite ill with \\"weak lungs\\" and told she only had six months to live. She was advised to travel to the south of France to recuperate. She retired from Wellesley in June 1887. Palmer was awarded an honorary Ph.D. by the University of Michigan in 1882 and an honorary L.H.D. from Columbia University in 1887. =Public speaker and advocate= Daniel Chester French, Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial, Houghton Chapel, Wellesley College She was a pioneer in the advancement of college education for women, and the image of educated women. A national figure, she portrayed herself as a New Woman, and especially in Boston was seen as a \\"respected, financially independent, successful academic woman devoted to promoting women's education.\\" She appeared in magazine and news stories and was requested for public speaking engagements. After she retired from Wellesley she also wrote articles for major magazines. In 1881, Palmer co-founded the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, which later became the American Association of University Women. She would serve as its President from 1885 to 1887 and again from 1889 to 1890. From 1887 to 1889, the newlywed lectured about higher education for women. After working at the University of Chicago, she continued lecturing and advocating for women's education. She was appointed to the Massachusetts Board of education. Palmer was the trustee of many organizations and worked to solve educational problems. She resigned as trustee of one college when she learned at a young woman was refused admission because she was colored. The school modified its policy shortly after Palmer resigned. In 1893, she helped organized the Woman's Building for the World's Fair in Chicago. Palmer received an honorary L.L.Ds in 1895 from Union College and the University of Wisconsin. She was a member of the Massachusetts State Board of Education from 1889 to 1902. From 1891 to 1901, she was the president of the Woman's Education Association in Boston. She was General Secretary of the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, one of the chief executive officers of the Association for Promoting Scientific Research by Women, and President of the International Institute for Girls in Spain. =University of Chicago= In 1892, Palmer accepted an offer by the president of the new University of Chicago as non- resident dean of the women's department or the colleges and graduate schools. Her husband had also been offered a position, but he decided to stay at Cambridge. She was required to be on-site for one third of the academic year. The goal of her office was to help students plan their educational career and create a social relationship between the university and its students. During her time as dean of the women's department she doubled the percentage of the female students at the school from 24% to 48%, which resulted in a backlash from mainly male faculty members. Discouraged by the faculty and staff's response, she resigned in 1895. Personal life Anne Whitney, Relief of George H. Palmer, 1896, Davis Museum, Wellesley College She had a number of suitors while at the University of Michigan and as she began her career, but waited to pursue marriage until she was established in her career with a comfortable income. Palmer had also been seen as the epitome of the New Woman, and so some people were content that she remained an independent unmarried woman. During her time at Wellesley she met her future husband, George Herbert Palmer, who taught at Harvard University. She was engaged to marry George and resigned from her position at Wellesley College in June 1887 partly due to her poor health. She had early signs of tuberculosis and was exhausted. Her new husband also felt that she had already made major strides towards improving the university. She took a break to recuperate. Alice and George married on December 23, 1887 and she began to give public speeches on women's higher public education. They had a \\"marriage of comradeship\\". They both pursued their individual careers, and George contributed efforts to managing the household, particularly when she was at the University of Illinois during her post there. While summering at her husband's home in Boxford, Massachusetts, she explored the local area, sewed, watched birds, and took up photography. They took long trips to Europe over three of George's sabbaticals, during which they lived in their favorite cities and traveled through the countryside on bicycles. She composed many beautiful poems, some of which are found in Life of Alice Freeman Palmer and A Marriage Cycle. In 1901, she wrote the hymn How sweet and silent is the place (Holy Communion). In December 1902, while the Palmers were in Paris on sabbatical, she complained of pains that required surgery to remove a bowel obstruction. Death During convalescence following surgery, she died of a heart attack. Palmer's life was commemorated at a service at Harvard University in 1903 attended by college presidents whom she knew and other notable individuals in higher education. George Herbert Palmer retained her ashes until 1909, when a monument was erected by sculptor Daniel Chester French at Houghton Chapel in Wellesley College. At his request, George's ashes were entombed beside his wife's in 1933. Posthumous honors Alice Freeman Palmer Institute, founded by Charlotte Hawkins Brown in 1902 and named in memory of Palmer Alice Palmer Building, Palmer Memorial Institute, built in 1922 The Alice Freeman Palmer Institute, commonly called the Palmer Memorial Institute, was founded in Sedalia, North Carolina in 1902 for African-American students by Charlotte Hawkins Brown, who was sponsored for her education and mentored by Palmer. Brown saw Palmer shortly before her death when she was fundraising for the school. It was named for Palmer following her death in December. In 1922, the school built the Alice Freeman Building, which held an auditorium, library, classes, and offices. It also had a collection of reproductions of art masterpieces, the first known school in the South for African-Americans to do so. In 1971, it was destroyed in a fire. In 1908, the first endowment at the AAUW was created in Palmer's memory to help women attend colleges, conduct research, and write dissertations. In 1920, Alice Freeman Palmer was elected to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. In 1921, Whittier College named a new women's literary society after her. The College had as its mission to create a female literary society, with the hope of bringing such groups back to Whittier College after they faded from existence at the beginning of World War I. Fullerton Junior College transfer Jessamynn West and friends reportedly researched and lobbied extensively to name the group for Alice Freeman Palmer, due to her reputation as a staunch advocate of higher education for women during the late 19th century. In the early years, the Palmer Society was an intercollegiate society that read and performed plays with the school's cross-town rival, Occidental College. Today, the Palmer Society's goal is still to \\"attain to the highest ideals of American womanhood.\\" References Sources     * Further reading   External links * * Category:1855 births Category:1902 deaths Category:American women's rights activists Category:People from Windsor, New York Category:People from Chicago Category:Presidents of Wellesley College Category:Wellesley College faculty Category:University of Chicago faculty Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:Hall of Fame for Great Americans inductees Category:Deans of women Category:Activists from New York (state) Category:People from Saginaw, Michigan Category:People from Colesville, New York Category:Women heads of universities and colleges ","title":"Alice Freeman Palmer"},{"id":"2535699","text":"H.

We examine the daily routine of > everyone who lives in the house and this gives us the functional diagram - > the functional diagram and the economic programme are the determining > principles of the building project.\\"(Meyer, 1928)Theo Van Leeuwen, > \\"Introducing Social Semiotics\\", Routledge, 2004, p.71 In 1926 Meyer established a company with Hans Wittwer and produced his two most famous designs, for the Basel Petersschule (1926) and for the Geneva League of Nations Building (1926/1927). Both projects are strict, inventive, and rely on the new possibilities of structural steel. Neither was built. The Petersschule was designed to be a new primary school for girls, such that the school itself would be raised as high above the ground as possible to allow for sunlight and fresh air.Claude Schnaidt, Hannes Meyer: Buildings, projects, and writings (New York: Architecture Book Publishing, 1965). Bauhaus Student accommodation at the ADGB Trade Union School, Berlin. Walter Gropius appointed Meyer director of the Bauhaus architecture department when it was finally established during April 1927, though Mart Stam had been Gropius's first choice. Meyer brought his radical functionalist philosophy which he named, during 1929, Die neue Baulehre (the new way to build).Hannes Mayer, \\"bauhaus und gesellschaft\\" (1929), cf. Wilma Ruth Albrecht: \\"Moderne Vergangenheit - Vergangene Moderne\\" (Neue Politische Literatur, 30 [1985] 2, pp. 203-225, esp. pp. 210-214) His philosophy was that architecture was an organizational task without relationship to aesthetics, that buildings should be low cost and designed to fulfill social needs. He was dismissed for allegedly politicizing the school. Meyer brought the two most significant building commissions for the school, both of which still exist: five apartment buildings in the city of Dessau known as Laubengangh√§user (\\"Houses with Balcony Access\\"). The apartments are considered to be 'real' Bauhaus buildings because they originated with the Bauhaus department of Architecture. The development bordered on the T√∂rten housing estate Bauhaus Dessau: T√∂rten estate by Walter Gropius (Accessed: 27 October 2016) which was designed by Walter Gropius.Architectuul: Laubengangh√§user Dessau (2015) (Accessed: 27 October 2016). The other major building commission was the Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (ADGB Trade Union School), in Bernau bei Berlin, which was completed during 1930. It was the second largest project ever undertaken by the Bauhaus, after the Bauhaus school buildings in Dessau.The Bauhaus building by Walter Gropius (1925-26) (Accessed: 21 October 2016)Internat der Handwerkskammer Berlin in Bernau (Photos with German text) (Accessed: 21 October 2016).Architectuul: ADGB trade union school (2013) (Accessed: 27 October 2016). The school operated for only three years until the Nazis confiscated it during 1933 for use as a management training school. The building now has historic protection status and it experienced an extensive restoration which was completed during 2007. The restoration project won the World Monuments Fund / Knoll Modernism prize during 2008. In July 2017 both the Laubengangh√§user and the ADGB Trade Union School were inscribed as part of the Bauhaus and its Sites in Weimar, Dessau and Bernau World Heritage Site. Walter Gropius appointed Meyer to replace him as the school's director on 1 April 1928.Bauhaus100. Hannes Meyer (Accessed: 6 February 2017) Meyer continued with Gropius' innovations to emphasize designing prototypes for serial mass production and functionalist architecture. In the increasingly dangerous political era of the Weimar Republic, Dessau's Mayor, Hesse, alleged that Meyer allowed a Communist student organization to flourish and bring bad publicity to the school, threatening its survival. Hesse dismissed Meyer as head of the Bauhaus school, with a monetary settlement, on August 1, 1930.Richard A. Etlin editor, Art, culture, and media under the Third Reich, page 291, On Meyer and the Communist students, see Meyer's open letter in a left-wing newspaper two weeks later characterizes the Bauhaus as \\"Incestuous theories (blocking) all access to healthy, life-oriented design... As head of the Bauhaus, I fought the Bauhaus style\\".Bauhaus, 1919-1933, by Magdalena Droste, Bauhaus-Archiv, page 199 Later life In the autumn of 1930, Meyer emigrated to the Soviet Empire, along with several former Bauhaus students, including Konrad P√ºschel and . He taught at WASI, a Soviet academy for architecture and civil engineering. During his years in the Soviet Union, he acted as an advisor for urban projects at Giprogor (the Soviet Institute for Urban and Investment Development) and created plans related to aspects of the redevelopment of Moscow as part of the first five-year plan.Talesnik, Daniel (2016) The Itinerant Red Bauhaus, or the Third Emigration. PhD Thesis in Architectural History and Theory, Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, Columbia University, New York in ABE Journal (Architecture Beyond Europe), volume 11, 2017. Retrieved 12 April 2019 Outside Moscow, Meyer realised his ideas especially in the recently created Jewish Autonomous Oblast in the Soviet Far East. Meyer not only realised the buildings (such as worker's dormitory, theatre etc.) and their internal design and furnishings but also developed the urbanist project for the area's capital, the city of Birobidzhan. In 1936, Meyer relocated to Geneva for three years and then emigrated to Mexico City to work for the Mexican government as the director of the Instituto del Urbanismo y Planificaci√≥n from 1939 through 1941. In 1942, he became the director of Estampa Mexicana, the publishing house of the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular (the Popular Graphic Arts Workshop). Meyer returned to Switzerland in 1949 and died in 1954.

The church is now on display at the Sverresborg Tr√∏ndelag Folkemuseum in the city of Trondheim. Original church The church originated in Haltdalen, where it served as the parish church. It was probably built in the 1170s. The church was moved to Trondheim during the 1880s. Church was re- located to the Sverresborg Tr√∏ndelag Folkemuseum in 1937. The church has been disassembled several times, which has led to repeated repairs. Significant original parts have been preserved for 800 years. The church on display today is a re-built version of two separate churches from neighboring locations: Haltdalen and √Ölen. The western wall and the portal are from the old √Ölen stave church. This is a single-nave stave church of the east Scandinavian- style, and it is the only one that is preserved. Replica in Iceland In commemoration of the thousandth anniversary of the conversion of Iceland to Christianity, developing a suggestion by the Icelandic government, the Norwegian state presented Iceland with a replica of the Haltdalen church, which was erected by the harbour of Vestmannaeyjab√¶r in the Vestmannaeyjar, in an area formed by the lava of the 1973 eruption of Eldfell. The replica was undertaken by the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research as a three-year research and reconstruction project from 1998 to 2000 under the leadership of Elisabeth Seip. The church was constructed at Lom from materials deliberately drawn widely from around Norway, including timber from R√∏ros, shingles from Odalen, tar from Skj√•k, wrought iron from V√•g√•, and a doorstep from Holt√•len. A gallery was added around the outside of the building, inspired by other stave churches, to provide the building with extra strength against the stormy weather of the Vestmannaeyjar. The church was built and consecrated in summer 2000. The project was supported by a Norwegian government grant of 5.5m Norwegian kroner; Icelandic government funding for the redevelopment of the Skansinn area of Vestmannaeyjarb√¶r as a heritage area; and some private sponsorship was also involved, most importantly that the Icelandic company Eimskip shipped the church to Iceland for free.Paul Torvik Nilsen, 'Colourful Middle Ages', Tell'us: Science in Norway (December 2001), 6‚Äì9.

Title page, copy E. An image of ‚ÄòHand‚Äô and ‚ÄòJerusalem‚Äô falls published in the book between chapters one and two. This image is plate 26 of Jerusalem the Emanation of the Giant Albion, copy E. It is tilted on its side in the manuscript. Jerusalem, subtitled The Emanation of the Giant Albion (1804‚Äì1820, with additions made even later), is the last, longest and greatest in scope of the prophetic books written and illustrated by the English poet, artist and engraver William Blake. Etched in handwriting, accompanied by small sketches, marginal figures and huge full-plate illustrations, it has been described as \\"visionary theatre\\". The poet himself believed it was his masterpiece and it has been said that \\"of all Blake's illuminated epics, this is by far the most public and accessible\\". Nonetheless, only six copies were printed in Blake‚Äôs lifetime and the book, like all of Blake‚Äôs works, was all but ignored by his contemporaries. The lyric to the famous hymn Jerusalem (text also by Blake, with music by Sir Hubert Parry) is not connected to this poem. It is in fact taken from the preface to another of Blake's \\"prophetic books\\", Milton. Production technique The poem, which was produced between 1804 and 1820, consists of 100 etched and illustrated plates, thus making it Blake's longest single work. The illustrated plates were made using Blake's self-devised technique of \\"illuminated printing\\", which required each copy to be individually coloured and produced, plate by plate. Blake was not averse to changing the text of some plates between printings or changing the colouring, as a result of which no two original copies of the poem are the same. Six copies (A-F) were printed between 1820 and 1827. Four copies (G‚ÄìJ) are posthumous (1832). Copy B is incomplete and includes only the First Chapter (25 plates). The arrangement of the Second chapter is different in early (A & C) and late (D & E) copies. Copy F, which was collated later in 1827 by John Linnell, is arranged like early copy C. There are only two coloured copies (B & E). Copy B being incomplete, the sole complete extant colour edition of the work (copy E) is in the collection of the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut.For more detail see Jerusalem The Emanation of The Giant Albion (1804-c. 1820) William Blake Archive. = Plate 1.

William Blake, Plate 01 Jerusalem Fitzwilliam Museum.jpg Separate proof (Fitzwilliam Museum). Summary of the poem William Blake: Druid Rocks with pitying figure of Jerusalem. Copy A, Plate 92, detail, (British Museum). Jerusalem tells the story of the fall of Albion, Blake's embodiment of man, Britain or the western world as a whole. The poetic narrative takes the form of a \\"drama of the psyche\\", couched in the dense symbolism of Blake's self-constructed mythology. Because it includes a cast of billions, Jerusalem can seem confusing. The poem does not have a linear plot. Characters morph in and out of each other. A character can be a person and a place. Jerusalem, the Emanation of Albion, is a woman and a city. Albion, \\"the Universal Humanity\\", is a man and a land (Britain). He contains twelve sons who co-inhere with the twelve tribes of Israel, as well as Four Zoas. Every Zoa (embodying a life principle) has an Emanation (a feminine figure through which the human can become divine). The Zoas and Emanations include: *Tharmas, the primal man, linked with Enion, an earth mother. *Urthona, the spirit of inspiration, embodied in Los, the prophetic artist, who forges a city of art in his furnaces. Enitharmon, his Emanation, weaves beams of beauty. *Luvah, the \\"feeling-function\\" Zoa, is Albion's spectre, whose counterpart Vala is Jerusalem's shadow. Vala eroticises war. *Urizen embodies Reason. Gracious Ahania is his Emanation. Chapter summaries =Chapter One: To the Public= Jerusalems first chapter tells the story of Albion's fall into Selfhood. Its overture sets the scene for Los's journey into Albion's interior and humanity's transfiguration in forgiveness of sins. In the first scene, Albion banishes Jerusalem and Jesus, blighting nature, culture and his internal life. Then Los contends with his Spectre, forcing him to work for Albion's restoration. Jerusalem mourns, animating shadowy Vala as Los builds Golgonooza, a city that can open into Edenic Eternity. Urizenic rationality assaults Jerusalem and enshrouds the life of the mind. Los battles against this, mapping Britain onto Israel, but his shadowy Spectre infects him with wrath and shame, stalking Albion's daughters and empowering Albion's warrior sons who banish Jerusalem. Vala tries to seduce Jerusalem. Albion curses them both, and finds himself enmeshed in Vala's deadly veil. He refuses divine forgiveness. =Chapter Two: To the Jews= Blake's Jews co-inhere with bellicose British Druids. In this chapter Los and a host of angelic Eternals attempt to rescue Albion. Los's Spectre and Emanation appear as refugees, fleeing from Albion to tell their version of his fall. Los journeys into Albion's interior where bloodthirsty Vala is worshipped. Then Los sensually constricts Reuben (Albion's son) in an attempt to control his lusts as Jesus imaginatively creates states through which humanity can find forgiveness. Angelmorphic Eternals (cathedral cities) seek to help Albion, but they too get blighted by Selfhood. Los rouses them, but Albion chooses to remain trapped. Vala tramples Jerusalem but wise Erin (Ireland) separates the poem's heroine from Albion in whose body she is infected with bellicose Moral Law. =Chapter Three: To the Deists= Blake's Deists create more violence than the Christianity they critique. When the chapter begins Albion's rational Moral Law infects Los, Albion falls yet again, and Vala's bellicose erotics encompass humanity. Urizen builds what he thinks is a redemptive Druid temple and Jerusalem works in Satanic mills where, infected by industrial chaos and Albion's morality, she can barely perceive Jesus and divine forgiveness. Vala melds with the rational beast, spreading war throughout the world, and her daughters enjoy human sacrifice. The peace of \\"heavenly Canaan\\" still hovers above Ulro's chaos, but Los fallibly builds Golgonooza which becomes the structure of \\"Religion Hid in War\\". The harlot-dragon reigns. =Chapter Four: To the Christians= Now universal humanity awakens to forgiveness. Jerusalem finally melds love with wrath, confronting shadowy Vala whose daughters weave death. As Los sings, Jerusalem appears tri-locational, emanating angelmorphic and descending as a city and a woman. Sexual contentions obstruct Los' work and Vala thrusts her wrath cup upon Jerusalem who is devoured by the dragon to rise again. Los keeps building, freeing himself from gender disputes. Time ends. The Breath Divine breathes. Albion awakens, and sees that Los is Christ and Christ is Los. He throws himself into Los's fires which become fountains of living water. Fragmented Zoas reunite in wars of love, in the Song of Jerusalem. All living things become a great Divine Body.

In the mid-20th century, it was a vibrant center of African American life in the area and the city. The 13-story hotel was built in 1912-13 by German-born stockbroker Gustavus Sidenberg (1843‚Äì1915), whose wife the hotel is named after,Aberjhani. \\"Hotel Theresa\\" in Aberjhani and West, Sandra L. (eds.) Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance, Facts On File, 2003. p.158 and was designed by the firm of George & Edward Blum, who specialized in designing apartment buildings. The hotel, which was known in its heyday as \\"the Waldorf of Harlem\\", exemplifies the Blums' inventive use of terra-cotta for ornamentation, and has been called \\"one of the most visually striking structures in northern Manhattan.\\" The building, now an office building known as Theresa Towers, was designated a New York City landmark in 1993 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. History The 13-storyAaron, Amanda. \\"Hotel Theresa\\" in , pp.618-19 hotel - with its striking white terra cotta facade with ornamentation made specifically for the project and not pre-fabricated stock items, as was standard practice - opened in 1913 and was, until the construction of the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building across the street in 1973, the tallest building in Harlem. It was primarily an apartment hotel, but also accepted temporary guests as well. In its early years, the hotel accepted only white guests, but it was bought in 1937 by Love B. Woods, an African American businessman who, in 1940, ended its racial segregation policy. The hotel had a two-story penthouse dining room which featured views of Long Island Sound to the east and the Palisades to the west, as well as a bar and grill. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Theresa became a center of the social life of the black community of Harlem; it was then that it was known as \\"the Waldorf of Harlem.\\" The hotel profited from the refusal of prestigious hotels elsewhere in the city to accept black guests. As a result, black businessmen, performers, and athletes were thrown under the same roof. The building was also the location of such institutions as A. Philip Randolph's March on Washington Movement, the March Community Bookstore, and the Organization of Afro-American Unity created by Malcolm X after he left the Nation of Islam. In 1960, Fidel Castro came to New York for the opening session of the United Nations, and, after storming out of the Hotel Shelburn on Lexington Avenue in Midtown Manhattan because of the management's demand for payment in cash, he and his entourage stayed at the Theresa, where they rented 80 rooms for $800 per day.Wilson, Sondra Kathryn. Meet Me at the Theresa : The Story of Harlem's Most Famous Hotel, 2004. p.205 Malcolm X and other civil rights leaders arranged for their stay. According to the New York Times, Castro felt that \\"Negroes would be more sympathetic\\" to his cause, and indeed he drew enthusiastic crowds of supporters, along with some protesters. While Castro was there, he was visited by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, as well as by such luminaries as Malcolm X, poets Langston Hughes and Allen Ginsberg, Gamal Abdel Nasser, the president of Egypt, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India, and radical sociologist C. Wright Mills. Subsequent to Castro's visit, other Third World leaders, such as Patrice Lumumba of the Belgian Congo, chose to stay at the Theresa. In October 1960, John F. Kennedy campaigned for the presidency at the hotel, along with Eleanor Roosevelt and other leading figures in the Democratic Party. Ron Brown, who was the United States Secretary of Commerce in the Clinton administration, grew up in the hotel, where his father worked as manager, and U.S. Congressman Charles Rangel (D-Harlem) once worked there as a desk clerk. The hotel suffered from the continued deterioration of Harlem through the 1950s and 1960s and, ironically, from the end of segregation elsewhere in the city. As African Americans of means now had alternatives, they stopped coming to Harlem. The owners had not upgraded or modernized the hotel in decades and it was said to be \\"dowdy\\" at best. New owners began converting the building to office space beginning in 1966, and the hotel closed in 1967. The building was renovated and restored, with the exterior largely kept as it had originally been, instead of being replaced with an aluminum and glass facade, an alternative which had been considered. The building reopened in 1970 as Theresa Towers, though a sign with the old name is still painted on the side of the building, and the old name is still commonly used. As well as housing commercial and professional tenants, it serves as an auxiliary campus for Columbia University's Teachers College and the Touro College of Pharmacy.

England served as a priest in Cork, where, before being appointed to Charleston, he was very active in the movement for Catholic Emancipation. Early life John England was born in Cork, Ireland, and initially pursued a career in law. He entered the office of a distinguished barrister, where he studied for two years.Clarke, Richard Henry. \\"Right Rev. John England, D.D.\\", Lives of the Deceased Bishops of the Catholic Church in the United States, Vol. 1, P. O'Shea, 1872, p. 273 In 1786 entered St. Patrick's, Carlow College on August 31, 1803. In his nineteenth year he began to deliver catechetical instructions in the parish chapel and zealously instructed the soldiers of the militia at Cork. He also established a female reformatory together with male and female poor schools. Out of these schools grew the Presentation Convent. In 1808, while yet a seminarian, he was appointed Director of the Theological School at Cork. He was ordained a priest in Cork, 10 October 1809, and was appointed lecturer at the North Chapel and chaplain of prisons.Webb. Alfred. \\"Bishop John England\\", A Compendium of Irish Biography, Dublin. M.H. Gill & Son, 1878 Wherever he preached people thronged to hear him. Pending the opening of the Magdalen Asylum he maintained and ministered to many applicants.Duffy, Patrick Laurence. \\"John England.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 7 Jun. 2014 In the same year he published the \\"Religious Repertory\\", established a circulating library in the parish of St. Mary, Shandon, and attended the city jail. He was proprietor and editor of the Cork Advertiser. In the elections of 1812 he fearlessly exerted his influence, maintaining that, \\"in vindicating the political rights of his countrymen, he was but asserting their liberty of conscience\\". In the same year he was appointed president of the new diocesan College of St. Mary, where he taught theology. In 1814 he vigorously assailed the Veto measure. Next to O'Connell's his influence was the greatest in the agitation which culminated in Catholic Emancipation. To help this cause he founded \\"The Chronicle\\" which he continued to edit until he left Ireland. in 1817 he was appointed parish priest of Bandon. (The bigotry and prejudice of this city at that time may be conjectured from the inscription over its gates: \\"Enter here Turk Jew or Atheist, Every man except a Papist\\", the Irish-Catholic ripost being even better \\"The man who wrote this wrote it well, For the same is writ on the Gates of Hell\\"). In spite of the prejudices which he found there, he soon conciliated men of every sect and party. Bishop An early photograph of England He was consecrated Bishop of Charleston at Cork, 21 September 1820,\\"Bishop John England, Our Founder\\", Sisters of Charity of Our Lady of Mercy in the parish church of St. Finbar's in Cork, by Bishop John Murphy, assisted by the newly consecrated Bishop of Richmond, Virginia, Patrick Kelly. England refused to take the customary oath of allegiance to the Crown, declaring his intention to become a citizen of the United States as soon as possible. He embarked from Belfast and arrived in Charleston 30 December 1820. Conditions were most uninviting and unpromising in the new diocese, which consisted of the three States of South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia. The Catholics were scattered in little groups over these States. The meagre number in Charleston consisted of very poor immigrants from Ireland and ruined refugees from San Domingo and their servants. In 1832, after twelve years of labour, Bishop England estimated the Catholics of his diocese at eleven thousand souls: 7500 in South Carolina, 3000 in Georgia, and 500 in North Carolina. South Carolina had been settled as a royal province by the Lords Proprietors, who brought with them the religion of the Established Church, and it was only in 1790 that enactments imposing religious disabilities were expunged from the constitution of the new State. When the newspapers would not publish his letters, he had his sermons published as paid advertisements. Religious and social antecedents and traditions, and the resultant public opinion, were unfavourable, if not antagonistic, to the growth of Catholicism. The greatest need was a sufficient number of Catholic clergy. This sparsely settled section, with scattered and impoverished congregations, had not heretofore attracted many men of signal merit and ability. Bishop England faced these unfavourable conditions in a brave and determined spirit. The day after his arrival he assumed formal charge of his see, and almost immediately issued a pastoral. He then set out on his first visitation of the three States comprising his diocese. In 1822 he organized and incorporated a Book Society to be established in each congregation, and in the same year established the \\"United States Catholic Miscellany\\", the first distinctively Catholic newspaper published in the United States. It continued to be published until 1861. In this, his sister Johanna assisted him. Bishop England went wherever he heard there was a Catholic, organized the scattered little flocks, ministered to their spiritual needs, appointed persons to teach catechism, and wherever possible urged the building of a church. During these visitations he preached in halls, court houses, State houses, and in Protestant chapels and churches, sometimes at the invitation of the pastors. When in Charleston he preached at least twice every Sunday and delivered several courses of lectures besides various addresses on special occasions. He successfully advocated before the Legislature of South Carolina the granting of a charter for his diocesan corporation, which had been strongly opposed through the machinations of the disaffected trustees. Bishop England was instrumental in the founding of an Anti-Dueling Association. In 1824, he established St. John the Baptist Seminary; its first student was Andrew Byrne. In 1830, he founded a diocesan congregation called the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy, and gave them for a rule that of the Presentation Sisters. His sister, Mother Mary Charles England, was Superior of the Presentation Convent in Cork. He tried to bring her to Charleston to train the new congregation, but Bishop Murphy would not permit it, given her advanced age. He was however, able to persuade a small group of Ursulines from the convent at Blackrock, near Cork, to come to the diocese. In 1826 he delivered, by invitation, an eloquent discourse before Congress, it was the first time a Catholic priest was so honoured.First Catholic Sermon in the House, Religion and the Founding of the American Republic, Library of Congress. He was chiefly instrumental in having the First Provincial Council of Baltimore convened, and pending this, formulated a constitution for his diocese defining its relations to civil and canon law. Bishop England was offered the Diocese of Ossory, but declined. This was incorporated by the State and adopted by the several congregations. He also organized conventions of representative clergy and laity in each of the States in his diocese, to meet annually. In 1840 these were merged into one general convention. He held a synod of the clergy, 21 November 1831, and in 1832 established a seminary and college under the name of \\"The Philosophical and Classical Seminary of Charleston\\", hoping with the income from the collegiate department to maintain the seminary. Notwithstanding his many and varied duties he devoted himself to this institution as teacher of classics and professor of theology. Organized bigotry soon assailed it, reducing the attendance from one hundred and thirty to thirty; but he continued and it became the alma mater of many eminent laymen and apostolic priests. In the words of Chancellor Kent, \\"Bishop England revived classical learning in South Carolina\\". He also compiled a catechism and prepared a new edition of the Missal in English with an explanation of the Mass. He was an active member of the Philosophical Society of Charleston, assisted in organizing the Antiduelling Society, and strenuously opposed Nullification in a community where it was vehemently advocated. His intense loyalty to his faith led him into several controversies which he conducted with a dignity and charity that commanded the respect of his opponents and elicited touching tributes from some of them at his death. African Americans In 1830 he established in Charleston the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy \\"to educate females of the middling class of society; also to have a school for free colored girls, and to give religious instruction to female slaves ; they will also devote themselves to the service of the sick\\". Subsequently their scope was enlarged, and branch houses were established at Savannah, Wilmington, and Sumter. In 1834 he further promoted education and charity by the introduction of the Ursulines. In 1835 Rt. Rev. William Clancy arrived from Ireland as the coadjutor of Bishop England, but, after two year's labor, was appointed vicar-general of Guiana. Bishop England had originally asked for the appointment of the Rev. Dr. Paul Cullen, then rector of the Irish College, Rome (afterwards the first Irish cardinal), as his coadjutor. He celebrated an early Mass in the cathedral for African Americans every Sunday and preached to them at this Mass and at a Vesper service. He was accustomed to deliver two afternoon sermons; if unable to deliver both, he would disappoint the rich and cultured who flocked to hear him, and preach to the poor. In the epidemics of those days he exhibited great devotion to the sick, while his priests and the Sisters of Mercy volunteered their services in the visitations of cholera and yellow fever. His personal poverty was pitiable. He was known to have walked the streets of Charleston with the bare soles of his feet to the ground. Several times the excessive fatigue and exposure incurred in his visitations and ministrations prostrated him, and more than once he was in danger of death. In 1832 he was appointed Apostolic Delegate to Haiti. England operated in a heavily Protestant city. During the 1820s-1830s, he defended the Catholic minority against nativist prejudices. In 1831 and 1835, the bishop established free schools for black children. In 1835, riled by the propaganda of the American Anti-Slavery Society, a mob raided the Charleston post office and the next day turned its attention to England's school for 'children of color.' Alerted, England led Charleston's Irish Volunteers to protect the school. Yet soon after this, when all schools for 'free blacks' were closed in Charleston, England was forced to concede,Joseph Kelly, \\"Charleston's Bishop John England and American Slavery,\\" New Hibernia Review 2001 5(4): 48-56 but continued the schools for mulattoes and free blacks. Legacy In the interests of his impoverished diocese he visited the chief towns and cities of the Union, crossed the ocean four times, sought aid from the Pope, the Propaganda, the Leopoldine Society of Vienna, and made appeals in Ireland, England, France, Italy, wherever he could obtain money, vestments, or books. In 1841, he visited Europe for the last time. On the long and boisterous return voyage there was much sickness, and he became seriously ill through his constant attendance on others. Though very weak, notwithstanding, on his arrival in Philadelphia, he preached seventeen nights consecutively, also four nights in Baltimore. With his health broken and his strength almost exhausted, he promptly resumed his duties on his return to Charleston, where he died. Most of his writings were given to the public through the columns of the United States Catholic Miscellany, in the publication of which he was aided by his sister. His successor, Bishop Reynolds, collected his various writings, which were published in five volumes at Baltimore, in 1849. A new edition, edited by Archbishop S.B. Messm√Ær of Milwaukee, was published at Cleveland in 1908. Bishop England High School, founded in Charleston, South Carolina in 1914, was named in his honor. Notes References * Carey, Patrick.

Use of the term is effectively limited to the field of chess problems, although it happens in real games a well (especially when White moves the bishop on d3 back to let the queen in front to threaten Qh7#, and analogous for Black). The idea can be understood in reference to the problem to the right, the first to demonstrate the manoeuvre, composed by its eponym, Henry Turton. A mate in three, the solution is 1.Bh8 (threatening 2.Qa3#) 1...b4 2.Qg7 Ra8 (defending against 3.Qa7#) 3.Qxb2#. The bishop moves along the diagonal a1-h8, then the queen moves onto that same diagonal, then the queen moves again in the opposite direction to the bishop. Specific types of Turton doubling are the Loyd-Turton, in which the first piece moved is of greater value than the second; and the Brunner- Turton, in which the two pieces are of equal value. Cases such as Turton's original, in which the piece moved first is of lesser value than the second, have no special name. Turton doubling can be contrasted with another form of doubling, Zepler doubling.

He was a major artist of the early Chinese Qing dynasty. He was regarded as one of the \\"Six Masters\\" of the Qing period, together with the Four Wangs and W√∫ L√¨. Biography Yun was born to a prominent but impoverished family in Wujin, Jiangsu province. He excelled in his classes and was expected to enter into the civil service, but his family could not afford it. Instead, he devoted himself to art; as early as the age of eight he was composing poetry on lotus blossoms. In his early life, he made a living painting landscapes. As a young man, once he had the means, Yun traveled China and became acquainted with the art of Wang Hui and Zha Shibiao. On seeing Wang Hui's landscapes for the first time, Yun felt overawed and gasped, saying \\"In this art, your learning and talent surpass all. Try as I may, I can only rank second.\\" Unwilling to rank second, Yun shifted his focus; he studied flowers, birds, insects, and bamboo. Yun imitated the 11th century artist Xu Xi's mogu (or 'boneless') method, an approach that tried to express art without rigidly defined outlines and forms. This style became a hallmark of the Yun family's artistic style, with Yun's daughter Bing continuing to develop the technique. Yun's style was vibrant and expressive; he attempted to display the inner vitality and spirit of his subjects in painting. Yun sought inspiration from the past; his Flower and Fruit (now at the Hong Kong Museum of Art) imitated the style of the masters of the Yuan dynasty. He was unafraid of using strong colors, such as reds and purples, which had traditionally been shunned by Chinese painters as they were seen as gaudy and offensive. He revived the genre of flower paintings in China and became popular throughout the country. Yun's style would be imitated and he became the founder of the Ch'ang-chou school of painting. Yun was also recognized as a prominent calligrapher, in which he followed the style of Chu Suiliang.

It is based on the creation of a lunar colony or city. Anarchy Enterprises described it as the \\"first 3-D Sim game ever\\", and noted that it has similarities to SimCity (which at the time was 2-dimensional). Gameplay Moon Tycoon has three campaigns to play through, each with its own story-line and placed around the year 2021. Campaign 1: Earth is in a global energy crisis, and the only thing that can stop it is a precious ore called Helium 3 that can only be found on the Moon. Campaign 2: The energy crisis is over, but competition begins to heat up as corporations battle for lunar domination as space borne epidemics, discontent over living conditions and space disasters become more frequent. Campaign 3: Mankind makes yet another leap as it begins the next stage of space exploration: the colonization of the asteroid belt beyond Mars. Each campaign has ten levels to play through each with varied levels of difficulty. All three campaigns make up a larger story, so they can only be played in order and starting with the first. There is also a sandbox mode; where you can set the starting money, terrain type, ore quantity and average building life; it also lets you select the Moon or asteroid. The game is played on the Play Area, on which completed and under-construction structures are displayed. Players also use this screen to begin construction of buildings and alter the terrain. The play area is raised up from the surrounding view and can also have a grid. To the right of the Play Area is the Building Menus, Colony Management, Disasters, and Options. The building menu display the various types of structures available for construction. These buildings are divided into different categories: Housing and Medical, Tourism, Research, Rewards (earned by different objectives), utilities, and Industry. Reception Deep Sea Tycoon The spiritual sequel, Deep Sea Tycoon, often confused with Atlantis Underwater Tycoon, is a 2003 video game developed by Anarchy Enterprises and published by Unique Entertainment. This game involves you building an underwater city in 3D. It has a sequel, Deep Sea Tycoon 2, developed by Pixel after Pixel. = Gameplay = The gameplay of Deep Sea Tycoon involves choosing one of 24 different characters and creating an underwater city filled with different buildings and features, from Mermaid Palaces to Seafood Restaurants. Through the character they choose and the choices they make in their city, the player can become a ruthless oil-tycoon, or something similar, or an environmentalist. The gameplay is similar to Moon Tycoon. The player creates buildings on a flat piece of land, that must be connected to other buildings by a \\"tunnel\\". The only major differences is the scenario, and the types of buildings each game uses. = Reception = Deep Sea Tycoon 2 has been reviewed by X-Play, being given a 1 out of 5. Being noted for being boring by having \\"ridiculously easy challenges\\" and simple challenges of only having to \\"click my mouse button twice\\". As a final note in their review, Adam Sessler noted that Game Tycoon was more entertaining than Deep Sea Tycoon 2.

Their constituent compounds were solids when they were primarily incorporated into the planets during their formation, either directly in the form of ices or trapped in water ice. Today, very little of the water in Uranus and Neptune remains in the form of ice. Instead, water primarily exists as supercritical fluid at the temperatures and pressures within them. Uranus and Neptune consist of only about 20% hydrogen and helium by mass, compared to the Solar System's gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, which are more than 90% hydrogen and helium by mass. Terminology In 1952, science fiction writer James Blish coined the term gas giantScience Fiction Citations, Citations for gas giant n. and it was used to refer to the large non-terrestrial planets of the Solar System. However, since the late 1940sMark Marley, \\"Not a Heart of Ice\\", The Planetary Society, 2 April 2019. read the compositions of Uranus and Neptune have been understood to be significantly different from those of Jupiter and Saturn. They are primarily composed of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, constituting a separate type of giant planet altogether. Because during their formation Uranus and Neptune incorporated their material as either ices or gas trapped in water ice, the term ice giant came into use. In the early 1970s, the terminology became popular in the science fiction community, e.g., Bova (1971)Bova, B. 1971, The Many Worlds of Science Fiction (Boston, MA: E.P. Dutton), but the earliest scientific usage of the terminology was likely by Dunne & Burgess (1978)James A. Dunne and Eric Burgess, The Voyage of Mariner 10: Mission to Venus and Mercury, Scientific and Technical Information Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 1978, 224 pages, page 2. read in a NASA report. Formation Modelling the formation of the terrestrial and gas giants is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial. The terrestrial planets of the Solar System are widely understood to have formed through collisional accumulation of planetesimals within the protoplanetary disc. The gas giants‚ÄîJupiter, Saturn, and their extrasolar counterpart planets‚Äîare thought to have formed solid cores of around 10 Earth masses () through the same process, while accreting gaseous envelopes from the surrounding solar nebula over the course of a few to several million years (Ma), although alternative models of core formation based on pebble accretion have recently been proposed. Some extrasolar giant planets may instead have formed via gravitational disk instabilities. The formation of Uranus and Neptune through a similar process of core accretion is far more problematic. The escape velocity for the small protoplanets about 20 astronomical units (AU) from the center of the Solar System would have been comparable to their relative velocities. Such bodies crossing the orbits of Saturn or Jupiter would have been liable to be sent on hyperbolic trajectories ejecting them from the system. Such bodies, being swept up by the gas giants, would also have been likely to just be accreted into the larger planets or thrown into cometary orbits. In spite of the trouble modelling their formation, many ice giant candidates have been observed orbiting other stars since 2004. This indicates that they may be common in the Milky Way. =Migration= Considering the orbital challenges of protoplanets 20 AU or more from the centre of the Solar System would experience, a simple solution is that the ice giants formed between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn before being gravitationally scattered outward to their now more distant orbits. =Disk instability= Gravitational instability of the protoplanetary disk could also produce several gas giant protoplanets out to distances of up to 30 AU. Regions of slightly higher density in the disk could lead to the formation of clumps that eventually collapse to planetary densities. A disk with even marginal gravitational instability could yield protoplanets between 10 and 30 AU in over one thousand years (ka). This is much shorter than the 100,000 to 1,000,000 years required to produce protoplanets through core accretion of the cloud and could make it viable in even the shortest-lived disks, which exist for only a few million years. A problem with this model is determining what kept the disk stable before the instability. There are several possible mechanisms allowing gravitational instability to occur during disk evolution. A close encounter with another protostar could provide a gravitational kick to an otherwise stable disk. A disk evolving magnetically is likely to have magnetic dead zones, due to varying degrees of ionization, where mass moved by magnetic forces could pile up, eventually becoming marginally gravitationally unstable. A protoplanetary disk may simply accrete matter slowly, causing relatively short periods of marginal gravitational instability and bursts of mass collection, followed by periods where the surface density drops below what is required to sustain the instability. Photoevaporation Observations of photoevaporation of protoplanetary disks in the Orion Trapezium Cluster by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation emitted by Œ∏1 Orionis C suggests another possible mechanism for the formation of ice giants. Multiple-Jupiter-mass gas-giant protoplanets could have rapidly formed due to disk instability before having the majority of their hydrogen envelopes stripped off by intense EUV radiation from a nearby massive star. In the Carina Nebula, EUV fluxes are approximately 100 times higher than in Trapezium's Orion Nebula. Protoplanetary disks are present in both nebulae. Higher EUV fluxes make this an even more likely possibility for ice-giant formation. The stronger EUV would increase the removal of the gas envelopes from the protoplanets before they could collapse sufficiently to resist further loss. Characteristics These cut-aways illustrate interior models of the giant planets. The planetary cores of gas giants Jupiter and Saturn are overlaid by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, whereas the mantles of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune are composed of heavier elements. The ice giants represent one of two fundamentally different categories of giant planets present in the Solar System, the other group being the more-familiar gas giants, which are composed of more than 90% hydrogen and helium (by mass). Their hydrogen is thought to extend all the way down to their small rocky cores, where hydrogen molecular ion transitions to metallic hydrogen under the extreme pressures of hundreds of gigapascals (GPa). The ice giants are primarily composed of heavier elements. Based on the abundance of elements in the universe, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur are most likely. Although the ice giants also have hydrogen envelopes, these are much smaller. They account for less than 20% of their mass. Their hydrogen also never reaches the depths necessary for the pressure to create metallic hydrogen. These envelopes nevertheless limit observation of the ice giants' interiors, and thereby the information on their composition and evolution. Although Uranus and Neptune are referred to as ice giant planets, it is thought that there is a supercritical water ocean beneath their clouds, which accounts for about two- thirds of their total mass.NASA Completes Study of Future ‚ÄòIce Giant‚Äô Mission Concepts.

Presented at the European Geophysical Union, 24 April 2017. =Atmosphere and weather= The gaseous outer layers of the ice giants have several similarities to those of the gas giants. These include long-lived, high-speed equatorial winds, polar vortices, large-scale circulation patterns, and complex chemical processes driven by ultraviolet radiation from above and mixing with the lower atmosphere. Studying the ice giants' atmospheric pattern also gives insights into atmospheric physics. Their compositions promote different chemical processes and they receive far less sunlight in their distant orbits than any other planets in the Solar System (increasing the relevance of internal heating on weather patterns). The largest visible feature on Neptune is the recurring Great Dark Spot. It forms and dissipates every few years, as opposed to the similarly sized Great Red Spot of Jupiter, which has persisted for centuries. Of all known giant planets in the Solar System, Neptune emits the most internal heat per unit of absorbed sunlight, a ratio of approximately 2.6. Saturn, the next-highest emitter, only has a ratio of about 1.8. Uranus emits the least heat, one-tenth as much as Neptune. It is suspected that this may be related to its extreme 98Àö axial tilt. This causes its seasonal patterns to be very different from those of any other planet in the Solar System. There are still no complete models explaining the atmospheric features observed in the ice giants. Understanding these features will help elucidate how the atmospheres of giant planets in general function. Consequently, such insights could help scientists better predict the atmospheric structure and behaviour of giant exoplanets discovered to be very close to their host stars (pegasean planets) and exoplanets with masses and radii between that of the giant and terrestrial planets found in the Solar System. =Interior= Because of their large sizes and low thermal conductivities, the planetary interior pressures range up to several hundred GPa and temperatures of several thousand kelvins (K). In March 2012, it was found that the compressibility of water used in ice-giant models could be off by one third. This value is important for modeling ice giants, and has a ripple effect on understanding them. =Magnetic fields= The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are both unusually displaced and tilted. Their field strengths are intermediate between those of the gas giants and those of the terrestrial planets, being 50 and 25 times that of Earth's, respectively. The equatorial magnetic field strengths of Uranus and Neptune are respectively 75 percent and 45 percent of Earth's 0.305 gauss. Their magnetic fields are believed to originate in an ionized convecting fluid-ice mantle.

Education in Botswana is governed by Ministry of Basic Education. The Private schools are generally free to determine their own curriculum and staffing policies, with voluntary accreditation available through independent regional accreditation authorities. About 87% of school-age children attend public schools, about 10% attend private schools, and roughly 3% are home-schooled. Education is compulsory over an age range starting between five and eight and ending somewhere between ages sixteen and eighteen. This requirement can be satisfied in public schools, state-certified private schools, or an approved home school program. Secondary education in Botswana is neither free nor compulsory.\\"Botswana6). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. In 2002, the gross primary enrollment rate was 103 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 81 percent. Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance. Recent primary school attendance statistics are not available for Botswana. As of 2001, 86 percent of children who started primary school were likely to reach grade 5. In Botswana‚Äôs education system, girls and boys have equal access to education. Girls, however, are likely to drop out of secondary school due to pregnancy. There are also a large number and wide variety of publicly and privately administered institutions of higher education throughout the country. Post-secondary education, divided into college, as the first tertiary degree, and graduate school, is described in a separate section below. Botswana made great strides in educational development after independence in 1966. At that time there were very few graduates in the country and very few Batswana attended secondary school. With the discovery of diamonds just after independence and the increase in government revenue that this brought, there was a huge increase in educational provision in the country. All students were guaranteed ten years of basic education, leading to a Junior Certificate qualification. Approximately half of the school population attends a further two years of secondary schooling leading to the award of the Botswana General Certificate of Education. After leaving school, students can attend one of the seven technical colleges in the country,UNESCO- UNEVOC country profile or take vocational training courses in teaching or nursing. The best students enter the University of Botswana, Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and The Botswana Accountancy College in Gaborone. A larger influx of tertiary students is expected when construction of the nation's second national university, The Botswana International University of Science and Technology, is completed. Many other students end up in the numerous private tertiary education colleges around the country. A high majority of these students are government sponsored. The quantitative gains have not always been matched by qualitative ones. Primary schools in particular still lack resources, and the teachers are less well paid than their secondary school colleagues. In January 2006, Botswana announced the reintroduction of school fees after two decades of free state education. Total government expenditure on education as percentage of GDP in Botswana was reported to be 9.633% in 2009, the highest among Sub-Saharan African countries.  Education stages  = Preschool = Preschool encompasses non-compulsory classroom-based early-childhood education prior to the age of five to six. Many community-based programs, commercial enterprises, non-profit organizations, faith communities, and independent childcare providers offer preschool education. Preschool may be general or may have a particular focus, such as arts education, religious education, sports training, or foreign language learning, along with providing general education. Botswana government as of 2015 has started opening early childhood education programs in many governmental primary schools in order to promote the education of young children. This started by opening a half-year pre- school class after the standard 7 students had finished writing their final exams. Their classrooms would be unoccupied for the rest of the academic year, so this way they could accommodate the 5-year-old children. Proceeding that, the government is now implementing a two-year program for children aged 4 and 5 years old. Moreover, government of Botswana also paying more attention to early childhood education. = Primary Education = Primary education ranges from standard 1 up to standard 7. Children enroll in primary school around the age of 6. The curriculum in primary education is determined by county school system. The school district selects curriculum guides and textbooks that reflect a state's learning standards and benchmarks for a given grade level. There are two types of primary education accessible in Botswana. The government provides education that is generally referred to as 'Setswana medium', the medium of instruction being Setswana as well as English. The private sector provides education whereby the language of instruction is purely English, these schools are referred to as 'English medium schools'. = Secondary Education = Kgari Sechele Secondary School, a government run secondary school. Secondary education ranges from form 1 up to form 5 (junior secondary: form 1‚Äîform 3; senior secondary: form 4‚Äîform 5). Students are usually given more independence, moving to different classrooms for different subjects, and being allowed to choose some of their class subjects (electives). The first three years of secondary education leads to the Junior Certificate, and after two more years of studying students sit for the Botswana General Certificate of Secondary Examination. = Higher education = The University of Botswana, Botho University, Limkokwing University of Creative Technology, Ba Isago University ABM University College, Botswana International University of Science and technology, Botswana Open University, Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Gaborone University College of Law and professional Studies, and Gaborone Institute Of Professional Studies are the institutions that offer university education in the country. The University of Botswana is the national university which was established in 1982 by act of parliament and is headquartered at Gaborone.  Tswanification of the curriculum  Soon after independence it was realized that the educational system did not meet the needs of the nation. It was highly focused on academics and still had colonial hangovers. Many of the things taught were not relevant to the African context, thus the school drop- out rates were high. It was soon realized that change was needed. In 1977 a commission appointed by the government of Botswana published a report on educational reform: 'education for kagisano' (meaning 'education for social harmony'). As advised in the report, new core subjects were introduced into schools, making the education more relevant for Botswana. The education aimed to be more vocational in order to prepare students for the job market.

SRO units are rented out as permanent residence and/or primary residence to individuals, within a multi-tenant building where tenants share a kitchen, toilets or bathrooms. SRO units range from 80 to 140 square feet.Levander, Caroline Field and Guterl, Matthew Pratt. Hotel Life: The Story of a Place Where Anything Can Happen. UNC Press Books, 2015. p. 130 In the 2010s, some SRO units may have a small refrigerator, microwave and sink. SROs are a form of affordable housing, in some cases for formerly or otherwise homeless individuals.Single-room occupancy hotels disappearing across Chicago. Chicago Tribune SRO units are the least expensive form of non- subsidized rental housing, with median rents even in New York City ranging from $450 to $705 per month. The term is primarily used in Canada and US. Since the 1970s and 1980s, there has been an increasing displacement of SRO units aimed at low-income earners due to gentrification, with SRO facilities being sold and turned into condominiums.Beckett, Katherine; Herbert, Steve. Banished: The New Social Control In Urban America. Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 27 Between 1955 and 2013, almost one million SRO units were eliminated in the US due to regulation, conversion or demolition. The term SRO refers to the fact that the tenant rents a single room, as opposed to a full flat (apartment). While roommates informally sharing an apartment may also have a bedroom and share a bathroom and kitchen, an SRO tenant leases the SRO unit individually. SRO units may be provided in a rooming house, apartment building, or in illegal conversions of private homes into many small SRO rooms. There is a variety of levels of quality, ranging from a \\"cubicle with a wire mesh ceiling\\", at the lowest end, to small hotel rooms or small studio apartments without bathrooms, at the higher end.BSullivan & Burke, p. 115 They may also be referred to as \\"SRO hotels\\", which acknowledges that many of the buildings are old hotels that are in a poor state of repair and maintenance. The acronym SRO has also been stated to mean \\"single resident only\\". The terms \\"residential hotel\\" or \\"efficiency unit\\" are also used to refer to some SROs.Wright, Gwendolyn. USA: Modern Architectures in History. Reaktion Books, Feb. 15, 2008 History The Harrison Hotel, an SRO hotel in Oakland, California. The term originated in New York City, probably in the 1930s (the Oxford English Dictionary provides an earliest citation of 1941), but the institutions date back at least fifty years before the nickname was applied to them. SROs exist in many American cities, and are most common in larger cities. In many cases, the buildings themselves were formerly hotels in or near a city's central business district. Many of these buildings were built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Theodore Dreiser described early SRO hotels in his 1900 \\"naturist novel of urban life\\", Sister Carrie. By the 1880s, urban reformers began working on modernizing cities; their efforts to create \\"uniformity within areas, less mixture of social classes, maximum privacy for each family, much lower density for many activities, buildings set back from the street, and a permanently built order\\" all meant that SRO hotels had to be cut back.Groth, Paul. Living Downtown: The History of Residential Hotels in the United States. Chapter One: \\"Conflicting Ideas about Hotel Life.\\" Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994. By the 1890s, SRO hotels became \\"forbidden housing; their residents, forbidden citizens.\\" New York City police inspector Thomas Byrnes stated that rather than give SRO hotels \\"palliative\\" care, they should be dealt with using a \\"knife, the blister, the amputating instruments.\\"Groth, Chapter Eight: \\"From Scattered Opinion to Centralized Policy.\\" Reformers used moral codes, building codes, fire codes, zoning, planning committees and inspections to limit or remove SRO hotels. An example of moral critiques is Simon Lubin's claims that \\"unregulated hotels\\" were \\"spreading venereal diseases among the soldiers\\". Other reformers tried to ban men and boys from rooming in the same hotels, due to concerns about homosexuality. The building and safety codes criticized SRO hotel problems such as \\"firetraps, dark rooms, inadequate plumbing, an insufficient ventilation.\\" In San Francisco, building code inspections and restrictions were often used to racially harass Chinese labourers and the places they lived. In 1917, California passed a new hotel act that prevented the building of new hotels with small cubicle rooms. In addition to banning or restricting SRO hotels, land use reformers also passed zoning rules that indirectly reduced SROs: banning mixed residential and commercial use in neighbourhoods, an approach which meant that any remaining SRO hotel's residents would find it hard to eat at a local cafe or walk to a nearby corner grocery to buy food. Non-residential uses such as religious institutions (churches) and professional offices (doctors, lawyers) were still permitted under these new zoning rules, but working class people (plumbers, mechanics) were not allowed to operate businesses such as garages or plumbing businesses. The Broadway Hotel, in Portland, Oregon, was built in 1913. It was turned into an SRO hotel. The United States saw a decrease in single room occupancy housing during the period of 1960s and 1970s urban decay. For example, in Chicago 81% of the SRO housing stock disappeared between 1960 and 1980.The Long, Slow Decline of Chicago's SROs  Chicago magazine  June 2013 Since the early 1970s, the supply of SRO spaces did not meet the demand in US cities. In 1970, newspapers in the US wrote about an \\"SRO [supply] crisis\\". Downtown SRO hotels offer few and possibly no rooms to rent to tourists. Indeed, since the end of WWII, the inexpensive hotels that became SROs were lost and not replaced, with the losses coming from conversion to office space, demolition, or upgrading to tourist rental. For example, in San Francisco from 1975 and 1980, 6,085 SRO rooms were lost; in Chicago, from 1973 and 1984, more than 23,000 SRO units were lost. Some viewed the removal of SRO hotels as a good thing, as it meant the \\"removal of substandard housing and unwanted neighbors\\" and their \\"public nuisance\\"; on the other hand, it was also viewed as causing more homelessness. Paul Groth states that some downtown \\"residents literally cannot exist without them [SROs]\\" as they have \\"[f]ew, if any, housing alternatives.\\" There are \\"myths about today's [SRO] hotel residents\\", claiming that they are all \\"isolated, needy, and disabled; all elderly; all on welfare; all elderly men; or all welfare mothers with three young children...[,] socially marginal, all mildly psychotic, all alcoholics or drug addicts, all drifters and transients\\", with some journalists using the derogatory term \\"welfare hotel\\". A 1985 study in Chicago revealed \\"a large minority of impoverished workers.\\" In New York City, about one third of SRO dwellers are black and one quarter are Hispanic. Most SRO residents do not move more often than apartment renters, contrary to media references to \\"transients.\\" In the mid-1990s, many \\"city health officials, architects, city planners, and politicians still argue that no one should live in [SRO] hotels\\", which are viewed as leading to \\"severe social and physical maladjustment\\" and \\"public nuisance.\\" Apart from media criticism, SRO residents are typically \\"unseen\\" and \\"invisible\\" in housing reform policies and reforms. SRO residents are typically not referred to explicitly in legislation, considered by city housing communities and urban development efforts, which means that SRO residents often have to move from district to district according to changes in real estate planning. San Francisco architect John Liu called SRO hotels the \\"most controversial, the most neglected, and the least understood of all housing types.\\" The invisibility of SRO residents is caused by a lack of interest in the lives of the poor and in their lack of a \\"political constituency\\", as most housing policy focuses on the family. With the huge reductions in the number of SRO rooms available to the lowest-income populations in the US, the role of SROs is being taken over by homeless shelters; however, many homeless people avoid staying at shelters because they find them to be \\"dangerous and unappealing\\" or because they do not meet entry requirements (due to being intoxicated), leading to more people sleeping on the streets.Wright, James D.; Rubin, Beth A.; Devine, Joel A. Beside the Golden Door: Policy, Politics, and the Homeless. Transaction Publishers pp. 21‚Äì22 SRO hotels may be literally invisible to higher-income passers-by when they are discreetly located on the upper floors of a restaurant or retail store. There is a debate as to whether SRO hotel residents are \\"homeless.\\" Paul Groth states that SRO residents are \\"not homeless. They are living in admittedly minimal and unusual dwelling units, often in hideous repair and under woefully inadequate management but dwelling units nonetheless.\\" SROs were considered socially acceptable even as late as the late 1950s: the Alfred Hitchcock movie Vertigo depicted young administrative staff living in downtown SRO hotels. An equivalent term to SRO is \\"residential hotel\\". =YMCA= The Bowery YMCA in Manhattan in 1893. In the US, the YMCA began building SRO facilities in the 1880s to house people from rural areas who moved into cities to look for work. The typical YMCA SRO housing provides \\"low-income, temporary housing for a rent of $110 per week (in 2005)\\" for stays that are typically three to six months long. By 1950, 670 of the 1,688 YMCAs in the US provided SRO spaces, which made 66,959 beds available. By the 1970s, the typical YMCA tenant was more likely to be homeless people and youth facing life issues, rather than people migrating from rural areas. The pop song and gay anthem \\"YMCA\\" by the Village People describes the YMCA's mix of \\"gay culture and working-class workouts coexisting in a single communal space\\", creating \\"a mix of white-collar and blue-collar residents, along with retired seniors and veterans\\", with about half of residents being gay. While the song gives the impression that YMCA SROs in the 1970s had a party atmosphere, Paul Groth states that YMCA SRO units actually had \\"more supervision of your social life‚Äîa kind of management as to how you behaved ... [than] in a commercial rooming house, which mostly wanted to make sure the rooms were rented\\", without monitoring who you brought to your room. While some YMCAs hired professionals to help homeless people and troubled youths (e.g., addictions counselors, social workers, etc.), overall, by the 2000s (decade), most YMCAs decided to move away from providing SROs. By 2004, only 81 of the 2,594 YMCAs still had SRO units. =United States= New York City For much of New York City's early history, housing was provided in shared accommodations that would probably be described as SROs today. These units provided housing for single, low-income men, and to a lesser degree, single low-income women. In New York City, the number of SRO units increased a great deal during the Great Depression, but with the deinstitutionalization of mentally ill people, SRO units became filled with tenants with mental health diagnoses, which led to bans on the building of new SRO units in the 1950s and taxation benefits for landlords to convert SROs into regular apartments. A small room at the Whitehouse Hotel in New York City.In the late 1940s, tens of thousands of Puerto Rican families moved to the Upper West Side; in response to this new demand for housing, landlords harassed tenants of rent controlled apartments to get them to leave and turned apartments into multi-room SROs, in some cases almost tripling their rental income for the same apartment building.Thabit, Walter. How East New York Became a Ghetto. NYU Press, Apr. 1, 2005. p. 31 Housing aimed at Puerto Ricans rose in price in response to the demand, while landlords reduced their maintenance. As the numbers of Puerto Ricans increased, overcrowding developed and bodegas and Hispanic-oriented stores opened; the elderly white middle-income residents became \\"hysterical on the subject of crime and safety\\", with community meetings held to deal with the issue of \\"foreigners\\" and \\"low types\\".Thabit, pp. 31‚Äì32 The anti-SRO policies of 1955 were introduced when the demographics of SRO residents changed towards immigrant families; in an environment influenced by \\"varying degrees of xenophobia and racism\\", the city took steps to ban new SRO unit construction, prevent families from living in SROs, and change building codes and zoning to discourage SROs.Sullivan & Burke, pp. 121‚Äì122 In the 1970s, the city introduced tax incentives for landlords to encourage them to convert SROs into regular apartments, a program which from 1976 to 1981 eliminated two thirds of the SRO stock in the city.Sullivan & Burke, p. 122 While the city realized by the 1980s that SRO units needed to be preserved, due to their role in housing homeless people, and introduced policies to encourage SRO retention, the number of SRO units had fallen by one half (from its Depression-era highest number). In 1985, the city tried to stop the loss of the remaining SRO units by banning the \\"conversion, alteration, or demolition\\" of SRO buildings, but by 1989, this law was struck down by an appeals court.Sullivan & Burke, p. 124 The huge loss of SRO units in New York City is \\"not the inevitable result\\" of \\"market forces\\"; it was caused by an interaction between city housing policies and market forces.Sullivan & Burke, p. 114 Paul Tyrrell states that when New York City housing prices rose in the early 2000s (decade), SRO landlords tried to remove longtime SRO tenants to use their real estate for more lucrative uses (one of these being Airbnb-style short-term rental). The owners of the Ace Hotel, a former SRO facility, converted their building to a luxury hotel, with only a few long-term, low-income SRO tenants using their leases to stay in the hotel. There are about 100,000 illegal SRO units in New York City, many of which are \\"unsafe, with too many people\\" for the space and a lack of proper fire exits and ventilation. Some landlords who wish to convert their old SRO hotel into a luxury boutique hotel may harass the renters or bribe the low- income tenants so they will leave.Sullivan & Burke, p. 129 New York City law requires building owners to receive a certificate of no harassment (CONH) in order to demolish or convert their building to prove they were not intentionally forcing tenants out through harassment or bribery.https://rew- online.com/2016/02/understanding-single-room-occupancy- laws/https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/renter/conh.page NYC residents of illegal SROs are reluctant to complain to housing authorities about the condition of their units or rent regulation violations, as doing so could lead to their eviction.Sullivan & Burke, p. 127 With the increasing popularity of Airbnb, an online room and house-renting service, housing activists were concerned that this could decrease the availability of SRO units, as landlords may find they can make more money from renting the rooms to tourists. In March 2016, affordable housing advocates in New York City were pleased when a judge ruled that an Upper West Side SRO facility (the Imperial Court Hotel) could not rent out rooms for less than 30 days, a short-term tenure that would favour tourist rentals over lower-income long-term renters. San Francisco Tenderloin district In the middle of the 19th century, gold prospectors, sailors, and seasonal fruit and vegetable pickers lived in San Francisco's SRO hotels during the winter. SROs played a key role in providing housing for immigrant single adults and families, particularly those from China, Philippines, Japan and Latino countries; the SRO district was nicknamed \\"hotel city\\" due to the number of SRO hotels. By the late 1940s, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency began working on \\"blight removal\\" and demolition, with thousands of SRO units destroyed to make way for redevelopment. In 1966, pro-development members of the community formed the San Francisco Planning and Urban Renewal Association (SPUR) to lobby for the removal of poor, immigrant and minority SRO tenants: SPUR stated that \\"If San Francisco decides to compete effectively with other cities for new \\"clean\\" industries and new corporate power, its population will move closer to standard white Anglo-Saxon Protestant characteristics\\", and thus the association called for exerting \\"influence\\" over the city's population to achieve SPUR's goals of improving the \\"health of the city\\". In 1968, when a demolition permit was sought for the International Hotel, an SRO hotel inhabited by Filipino seniors, activists and protesters fought to stop it from being destroyed. Although community groups tried to stop the demolition with activism and court action, by 1977, the tenants were ordered to be evicted; protesters formed a human chain to stop the demolition, but police removed them and the building was razed. During the 1970s, as San Francisco became a popular and economically successful city, job seekers came seeking homes; Justin Herman, the Executive Director of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency criticized the presence of SROs, saying \\"This land is too valuable to permit poor people to park on it\\". By 1980, the hotel and convention industries were lobbying for the building of new hotels for tourists; tenant activists protested what they viewed as the \\"Manhattanization\\" of the city, including the gentrification and impacts on traffic and air cleanliness. From 1975 to 2000, landlords eliminated about 6,085 SRO units. From 1989 to 2002, more than 1,700 SRO units were destroyed by fires. Even in the 2000s, immigrants live three or four tenants per SRO room. San Francisco is an example of a city that took over particularly squalid SROs, and renovated them for the disadvantaged. Landlords who intend to convert SROs may try to convince their tenants to sign releases, which may require relocation by the landlord and/or compensating the tenant. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development subsidizes SRO rehabilitation to combat homelessness, under the McKinney‚ÄìVento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. San Francisco passed an SRO Hotel Conversion Ordinance in 1980, which restricts the conversion of SRO hotels to tourist use. SROs are prominent in the Tenderloin, Mission District and Chinatown communities. In 2001, San Francisco Supervisor Chris Daly sponsored legislation making it illegal for SRO landlords to charge \\"visitor fees\\"‚Äîa practice long run in order for hotel managers to get a \\"cut\\" on drug-dealing or prostitution activities in the building. After a rash of fires destroyed many SROs in San Francisco and left nearly one thousand tenants homeless, a new program to reduce fire risk in SRO hotels was initiated. In 2015, there were reports that San Francisco's Hotel EPIK would turn the New Pacific Hotel, a former SRO hotel, into a luxury boutique hotel. A 1980 city ordinance prohibits SRO landlords from renting SRO units to tourists for short term stays (which will result in a fine unless the landlord creates a replacement SRO unit). Jerry Threet, San Francisco' deputy city attorney, says that SROs are \\"often the last barrier between SF‚Äôs poorest population and the streets\\". Threet says some SRO owners do the \\"bare minimum to maintain their buildings\\", leading to unsafe SRO units. In 2014, City Attorney Dennis Herrera sued the owners and managers of 15 San Francisco SROs for \\"pervasive violations of state and local laws intended to protect residents‚Äô health, safety and tenancy rights\\". Herrera alleges that the SROs harass or otherwise push out SRO tenants before they can get 30 days tenancy, which gives them protection, an action nicknamed \\"musical rooms\\". He also alleges that the SROs either do not do repairs of their units, or do repairs without permits and without licensed, qualified contractors. In 2016, The Guardian reported that the average SRO rents in San Francisco's Chinatown are increasing from $610 in 2013, to $970 in 2015 (the average rent for all rental housing was $3,907). The increase in SRO rents is due to the shift away from renting to Chinese immigrants towards \\"college graduates, single adults and white people\\". In 2016, about 60% of San Francisco's supportive housing tenants lived in SRO hotels. Newspaper reporters found \\"chronic maintenance issues, health code violations and frustrated residents\\" at some of these SRO hotels, typically built a century ago, including the Crosby Hotel in Tenderloin, which had \\"vermin infestations\\", no power, leaking pipes, and an elevator that was unreliable. Following numerous complaints, the owners of the Crosby Hotel spent $700,000 to repair and upgrade the building. The problems in the city's old SRO hotels are \\"old buildings with aging infrastructure filled with traumatized or dysfunctional people who sometimes can be destructive or neglectful through hoarding, attracting vermin or willfully damaging property\\". The Henry, another SRO hotel, is also being improved, with staff giving it new paint, an atrium area, WiFi and computers. A 2018 article states that some SRO landlords in San Francisco are \\"holding [SRO] rooms empty, perhaps for years, driving up the value of a building\\" rather than rent them to low-income people; Erik Schmitt states that one in seven SRO rooms in the city are vacant, with some hotels having 100% vacancy. Seattle The arrival of Asian immigrants to the Seattle area in the 1880s, many living in crowded rooming houses, led to concerns from the city council, which passed a cubic air ordinance in 1886 requiring 500 square feet of air space per resident. By the early 1900s (decade), Asian immigrants from Japan and China who settled in Seattle were typically the men from the family, who moved to the city's Chinatown and Nihonmachi districts and lived in SROs.Ochsner, Jeffrey Karl. Shaping Seattle Architecture: A Historical Guide to the Architects, Second Edition. University of Washington Press, May 1, 2017. Chinese immigrants came to Seattle to work as miners, cooks, railway laborers and cannery workers. These SRO residents used the restaurants, bath-houses, and barbershops to meet their living needs while they worked in Seattle-area industries.Ochsner, Jeffrey Karl. Shaping Seattle Architecture: A Historical Guide to the Architects, Second Edition. University of Washington Press, May 1, 2017. Some SROs aimed at Asian residents had a bath-house in the basement to serve Japanese immigrant clients.Ochsner, Jeffrey Karl. Shaping Seattle Architecture: A Historical Guide to the Architects, Second Edition. University of Washington Press, May 1, 2017. One SRO in Seattle's Chinatown that housed immigrant workers, the West Kong Yick hotel, was closed in the 1970s when it could not afford to comply with Seattle fire and building code updates; it was still closed in 2018. By 1980, only 77 of Seattle's original 350 residential hotels were still standing, due to demolitions. In the 1990s, several of the big SRO hotels were renovated, including the Milwaukee, the Northern Pacific, and the Eastern; however, the fire, safety, and earthquake code upgrades led to big rental increases (for example, the Publix Hotel rental went from $75 per week for a SRO in the early 2000s to $1,350 per month for a micro-studio in 2018). From 2009 to 2014, Seattle had a big increase in the building and creation of new SRO units designed to be rented at market rates, which had an average monthly rent of $660; In 2013, for example, 1,800 SRO units and microapartment units were built. In 2018, the media depicted the increasing popularity of micro apartments as a new trend; however, an article about Seattle in Market Urbanism Report states this is a \\"reenactment of the way U.S. cities have long worked\\", as individuals seeking \\"solo living and centralized locations\\" are willing to accept smaller apartments even though the per-square-foot prices may be higher than some larger units. The report states that 2018-era micro apartments were known as SROs in the early 20th century, and they housed \\"rich and poor alike\\" (although the rich lived in live-in luxury hotels and the poor lived in \\"bunkhouses for day laborers\\"). Neighborhood groups in Seattle have criticized new micro apartment SRO units, arguing that they \\"harmed community character and provided ... inhumane living conditions; due to these concerns, the city passed regulations that outlawed micro apartment/SRO construction. =Canada= In Canada, SRO hotels (also known as \\"residential hotels\\") are most often seen in Vancouver. (In other major cities such as Toronto, rooming houses in converted single-family dwellings are the equivalent form of affordable housing available.) SROs in Vancouver may be either privately-owned and for-profit, privately-owned and non-profit, or owned by government. As of 2019, there were a total of 156 SRO hotels in Vancouver. Most are occupied primarily (though not exclusively) by people struggling with mental health and/or addiction issues, and who are likelier than average to have experienced homelessness. Tenants typically have their own private rooms, but share washroom and kitchen facilities with other tenants. Rooms generally cost between $375 and $800 (CAD, ca. 2015), well below the average cost of Vancouver rental housing. Most SROs were originally intended to be short-term accommodations for seasonal male workers, as well as young families, and recent immigrants, in the early 1900s. Two hotels which would later become notorious, the Balmoral and the Regent, were even considered luxury accommodations. However, first the Depression and then the 1970s closure of psychiatric hospitals (and attendant lack of regard or care of mentally ill Vancouverites), along with the flight of the wealthy and middle class to the suburbs, contributed to the decline and lack of investment in the Downtown Eastside. By the 1970s and 1980s, Vancouver SROs' reputations were poor. A 1989 University of British Columbia thesis by Mercedes Mompel Antolin asserted that only 10%-20% of SROs were of good or acceptable quality at the time of writing. And even by 1989, the number of SROs was diminishing: 2,704 units were lost in the period between 1978 and 1986, largely due to the pressures of an increasingly hot real estate market. Real estate market pressures on SRO tenants have not abated in the 30 years since that thesis was published. The market stock of SROs is decreasing both in terms of vacancy rates and in terms of affordability, and quality of life in SROs is highly variable. Certain privately-owned SRO hotels in Vancouver are notorious for their poor maintenance, absentee landlords, crime, and frequency of drug overdoses; the Sahota family has been responsible for the ownership of many such SRO hotels, such as the Regent and the Balmoral, both of which were ordered to close and were expropriated by the City of Vancouver. While it cannot be said by any reasonable person that the loss of these residences constitutes the loss of quality rental stock (the Balmoral and the Regent were plagued by systemic and deliberate neglect, and tenants had to be evacuated), the decline in availability of affordable housing has been exacerbated by the closure of some SRO hotels. Uses The St. Francis Residence in New York City was turned into an SRO hotel in 1951. In the 1980s, it was turned into supportive housing for low-income tenants. SROs are a viable housing option for students, single tenants, seasonal or other traveling workers, empty nester widows/widowers, divorced men, low-income people, or others who do not want or need large dwellings or private domestic appliances. The smaller size and limited amenities in SROs generally make them a more affordable housing option, especially in gentrifying neighborhoods or urban areas with high land values and high rents. The rents of many poor tenants may be paid in full or in part by charitable, state, or federal programs, giving incentive to landlords to accept such tenants. Some SRO buildings are renovated with the benefit of a tax abatement, with the condition that the rooms be rented to tenants with low incomes, and sometimes specific low-income groups, such as homeless people, people with mental illness, people with HIV/AIDS, and so on. A 1991 study stated that SROs can be successfully used to provide housing for people with chronic mental illness, as SROs give residents \\"personal freedom and privacy\\" while also giving a sense of community. Some SROs are operated or funded by charities, non-profit organizations, and/or governments as a way to provide supportive housing to \\"special needs populations\\", which include people facing drug and alcohol addiction, mental health issues, or disabilities. Carswell, Andrew T. \\"Single-room occupancy housing\\". The Encyclopedia of Housing, Second Edition. SAGE Publications, May 31, 2012 =More expensive units= While SRO units are mostly associated with low- income renters, in cities where dwellings are expensive and scarce, there may be \\"middle-class SROs\\", a type of microapartment aimed at middle class and professional renters. The first 2010s-era micro-unit housing building in New York City, Carmel Place, opened in 2016. It has 55 studios which go from 260 to 360 square feet. An article about \\"21st Century SROs\\" states that even though there is \\"still a stigma around SROs because of some of the experience of the last century\\", there is a \\"growing acceptance that small spaces can be well run and safe, healthy spaces to live and can be built more cheaply.‚Äù Common's Williamsburg in Brooklyn rents single rooms where tenants share a kitchen for $2,050 per month; The Guardian states that \\"[s]ingle room occupancy housing is obviously not a new concept, however, the genius of late capitalism is that it has made it desirable\\" to high-income renters. In 2017 in New York City, Matthew and Seth Weissman, who operate Weissman Equities, renovated a partly empty apartment building in Harlem, creating furnished SRO units with 180 to 280 square feet, which rent for $1,200 to $1,600 per month (this includes utilities and cleaning). \\"Luxury\\", \\"amenity-laden\\" SRO units are available for $2,150 from Common Baltic in Boerum Hill and for $3,050 per month from WeLive (the residential version of co-working company Wework). In San Francisco, Starcity is converting unused parking garages, commercial spaces and offices into single-room residential units, where tenants (tech professionals are the typical renter) get a furnished bedroom and access to wifi, janitor services and common kitchens and lounges for $1,400 to $2,400 per month, an approach that has been called \\"dorm living for grownups\\". In Atlanta, PadSplit is a cohousing organization that converts single-family homes into single rooms that their members can occupy individually, with a shared kitchen and bathroom, along with wifi, and laundry facilities. Unlike WeLive, which is aimed at high-income professionals, PadSplit is aimed at working-class members, and it has single room dues from $500 to $750 per month. Conditions Depending on the landlords and the quality of the properties, SRO conditions can range from squalor to something like an extended-stay, basic hotel. Some have been designed and run in a dormitory fashion. Others have been \\"cage\\" hotels, in which a large room is split into many smaller ones with corrugated steel or sheetrock dividers or cubicles, which do not reach the height of the original ceiling. To prevent tenants from climbing over the walls into each other's spaces, the tops of the rooms are covered in chicken wire, making the rooms look something like cages. A 1991 article in Social Work calls SRO hotels the \\"nation's least desirable housing stock\\" and states that the facilities led to elderly people being \\"trapped in a situation that exacerbated their isolation and withdrawal from society\\", even though they were in \\"desperate need of social services\\".Rollinson, Paul A. \\"Elderly Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Hotel Tenants: Still Alone.\\" Social Work, Volume 36, Issue 4, 1 July 1991, pp. 303‚Äì08, SRO buildings have been associated with fire risk; in Chicago alone, SROs with serious fires included Barton Hotel in 1955, the Royal Bench Hotel in 1981, the Paxton Hotel in 1993, and the J.R. Plaza Hotel (also called \\"the Zanzibar\\") in 1999.D'Eramo, Marco. The Pig and the Skyscraper: Chicago : a History of Our Future. Verso, 2003 p. 239 In the popular imagination, SRO hotels \\"carry the stigma of vice and drunkenness\\", and in fiction writing, there are novels where SROs are used to indicate skid row conditions.D'Eramo, Marco. The Pig and the Skyscraper: Chicago : a History of Our Future. Verso, 2003 p. 240 While urban reformers who advocate for the removal of SROs state that \\"more 'dignified' forms of affordable housing\\" should be created in the place of SROs, Marco D'Eramo states that \\"SRO inhabitants have rejected this notion in...surveys, declaring themselves to be reasonably content with their lodger lifestyle.\\"D'Eramo, Marco. The Pig and the Skyscraper: Chicago : a History of Our Future. Verso, 2003 p. 241 In the 1990s, SRO rooms in Chicago only cost about $60 less per month than renting a single-room apartment; however, SROs do not require a two-month deposit paid by check or credit card (thus requiring a bank account) and a guarantee of regular income (standard requirements for apartments).D'Eramo, Marco. The Pig and the Skyscraper: Chicago : a History of Our Future. Verso, 2003 p. 242 SRO hotels differ from government and nonprofit housing services in that whereas these facilities have requirements for \\"minimum age, alcoholic or drug program eligibility, religious affiliation, welfare system dependency\\", SRO hotels were anonymous and generally accepted anyone who could pay the monthly rent, without requiring identification and information for official databases, setting restrictions on when residents could enter or leave, or requiring exposure to religious recruitment.Slattery, Tom. Preshrunk Ponderings and Rumpled Rememberings. iUniverse, Apr. 3, 2001. p. 3 A study of 485 New York City SRO tenants found that elderly people wanted to stay in their SRO units, so that they could live in \\"centrally located neighborhoods where apartment housing was beyond their means\\", without sharing a room. Crystal S, Beck P. \\"A room of one's own: the SRO and the single elderly\\". Gerontologist. 1992 Oct; 32(5):684‚Äì92The study concluded that for \\"many elderly residents, SROs meet needs not easily met by available alternatives\\" and recommended maintaining SROs as an option for seniors.Crystal S, Beck P. \\"A room of one's own: the SRO and the single elderly\\". Gerontologist. 1992 Oct; 32(5):684‚Äì92 A 2013 study of the approximately 3,000 SRO tenants who live in Vancouver‚Äôs Downtown Eastside found that two-thirds were previously homeless and had an average of three illnesses each, with 95% facing substance dependence and almost two-thirds doing injection drugs. Nearly half had psychosis or a neurological disorder and 18% were HIV-positive. About 28% of the participants were Indigenous. The death rate of the SRO tenants was five times greater than the general population. In a 2018 paper, Barbic et al stated that young adults living in Vancouver SROs were a \\"vulnerable\\" and low-income group with \\"complex health and substance problems compared to their peers in the general population\\", typically on \\"median two co-occurring illnesses, including mental, neurological, and infectious diseases\\", and all had \\"lifetime alcohol and cannabis use, with pervasive use of stimulants and opioids\\", and they had a great deal of contact with the \\"health, social, and justice systems\\". Barbic, Skye P.; Jones, Andrea A.; Woodward, Melissa et al. \\"Clinical and functional characteristics of young adults living in single room occupancy housing: preliminary findings from a 10-year longitudinal study\\". Canadian Journal of Public Health. April 2018, Volume 109, Issue 2, pp. 204‚Äì14 SRO hotels are \\"often viewed as unsafe by youth\\" in Canada who are seeking affordable housing. Guirguis-Younger, Manal; Hwang, Stephen W.; and McNeil, Ryan. Homelessness & Health in Canada. University of Ottawa Press, 2014 At a Vancouver protest calling for more affordable housing, singer and actor Dalannah Gail Bowen stated that SRO units are \\"'horrible' places to live\\" that have \\"...squalor, like Third World countries\\" that \\"[n]o one deserves to live in\\". Illegal, unlicensed SRO units that are created in homes and apartment buildings may be overcrowded and lack fire exits and ventilation. In 2013, SROs were described as a \\"poorly regulated last resort for the most desperate populations.\\" A maintenance worker at an SRO hotel pauses while renovating an old room. In Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, an impoverished district where many SROs and homeless shelters are located, the B.C. Supreme Court ruled against an SRO hotel's requirement that visitors to the building show government-issued identification prior to entry. The hotel argued that the ID requirements were needed to provide a safe housing environment in what they called a \\"dangerous neighbourhood\\" with a \\"unique demographic\\" of individuals who are addicted to drugs and alcohol. The tenant who took the SRO to court argued that the policy was too restrictive, as many of his guests did not have ID. In the first ruling by the Residential Tenancy Branch, an arbitrator held that landlords cannot \\"unreasonably restrict access by guests to a rental property\\". The B.C. Supreme Court supported the arbitrator's decision, stating that there was no evidence that the tenant in the case had a history of issues with his behaviour on the property, and nor did his guests; the judge said that tenants and their guests should be protected against \\"unreasonable interference from landlords\\". The construction of new SROs or conversion of existing homes to multiple SRO units was banned in New York City in 1955 due to concerns that they provided \\"substandard housing conditions\\" that were \\"improper and unsafe\\". Renters of illegal SRO units typically live in units that do not meet health and safety standards; as well, since the units are unregulated, the renters do not have protection against eviction or rent increases. Many SRO buildings, particularly in major cities, face strong development pressure for conversion to more profitable uses as condos, luxury apartments or high-end hotels. Some cities have regulated the conversion of SROs to other uses in order to prevent landlords from forcibly evicting SRO tenants, while conversely many others conversely limit the conversion of other uses into SROs and restrict them via zoning. Some cities do both simultaneously, protecting existing SROs while making it virtually impossible to create new ones. A 2014 article about SRO housing in San Francisco stated that SROs have become a \\"key urban built environment used to house poor populations with co-occurring drug use and mental health issues\\"; specifically, it found that women drug users in SROs have more \\"post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression versus \\"stably housed women\\".

The term refers to children as young as five years old who provide self-care or to older children who supervise their younger siblings. History of the term The term refers to the latchkey of a door to a house. The key is often strung around the child's neck or left hidden under a mat (or some other object) at the rear door to the property. The term seems to first appear in a CBC radio program called \\"Discussion Club ‚Äì Topic: How War Affects Canadian Children\\" in 1942,Replayed in CBC Broadcast \\"Rewind\\" on 2014-10-23 due to the phenomenon of children being left home alone during World War II, when the father would be enlisted into the armed forces and the mother would need to get a job. Given that the \\"Discussion Club\\" participants are all familiar with the term and allude to it being in colloquial usage, it likely predates 1942. In general, the term latchkey designates \\"those children between the ages of five and thirteen who care for themselves after the school day until their parents or guardians return home\\".Benne, M. Principles of children's services in public libraries. Chicago: American Library Association, 1991 More specifically for their purposes, the San Marino (CA) Public Library has defined a Library Latchkey Child as \\"one who on a regular basis is required by their parents or guardian to remain at the public library for extended periods of time after school in lieu of day care. 'Regular basis' is defined as three or more days per week. 'Extended period' is defined as two or more hours per day\\" (American Library Association 12).American Library Association (ALA). Association for Library Services to Children's Division. \\"Latchkey children\\" in the public library.\\" Chicago, American Library Association. The term latchkey kid became commonplace in the 1970s and 1980s to describe members of Generation X who, according to a 2004 marketing study, \\"went through its all-important, formative years as one of the least parented, least nurtured generations in U.S. history.\\" Latchkey kids were prevalent during this time, a result of increased divorce rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce at a time before childcare options outside the home were widely available. These latchkey children, referred to as \\"day orphans\\" in the 1984 documentary, To Save Our Children to Save Our Schools, mainly came from middle or upper-class homes. The higher the educational attainment of the parents, the higher the odds the children of this time would be latchkey kids. Effects on children The effects of being a latchkey child differ with age. Loneliness, boredom and fear are most common for those younger than 10 years of age. In the early teens, there is a greater susceptibility to peer pressure, potentially resulting in such behaviors as alcohol abuse, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity and smoking.Barlow, David; Durand, V. Mark (2008). Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach. Cengage Learning. p. 414.\\"Early teens increasingly prone to smoke and drink alcohol.\\" The Korea Herald. May 24, 1999. The behaviors might stem from \\"unspent energy, peer pressure to misbehave, or hostility because of the lack of appropriate adult attention\\".American Library Association (ALA). Association for Library Services to Children's Division. \\"Latchkey Children\\" in the public library.\\" Chicago, American Library Association. However, some children experience other effects, such as an early development of self-reliance, adaptation to difficult situations, and a desire to contribute to a visible need in the household. Socioeconomic status and length of time left alone can bring forth other negative effects. In one study, middle school students left home alone for more than three hours a day reported higher levels of behavioral problems, higher rates of depression, and lower levels of self-esteem than other students. Children from lower income families are associated with greater externalizing issues (such as conduct disorders and hyperactivity) and academic problems. This association was weaker for children from middle income families as compared to their supervised peers. In 2000, a German PISA study found no significant differences in the scholastic performance between \\"latchkey kids\\" and kids in a \\"nuclear family\\". Positive effects of being a latchkey child include independence and self-reliance at a young age. Deborah Belle, author of The After-School Lives of Children: Alone and with Others While Parents Work suggests that being left home alone may be a better alternative to staying with baby-sitters or older siblings. Legal issues The legality of the latchkey children's \\"alone time\\" varies with country, state and local area. In the United States, state and local laws typically do not specify any particular age under eighteen when a child can be legally left without supervision. However, some states do have specific age restrictions. Parents can be held accountable by child welfare, child protective services organizations, or law enforcement if children come to harm while left without supervision if, in the opinion of the agency, the children's age or other considerations made such a choice inappropriate. Legal issues also continue to be important concerns for those who work in libraries. They worry about the potential liability should an unattended child be hurt, molested or abducted while at the facility. This issue becomes critical, particularly at closing time when \\"parents who are late picking up their children also create safety and possibly legal problems.\\"Smith, K. Serving the difficult customer: a how to do it manual for library staff. New York: Neal Schuman Publishers, Inc. Community calling programs Some communities offer services through the police departments and community organizations to check in on latchkey kids. Calls can be made by community organizations or volunteers. Automatic calling programs such as Call Reassurance call households during the week after children arrive home and require the child to answer the phone and positively acknowledge that he or she is okay. If the call is not answered, automatic calls can likewise be sent to the parents, police, or other response centers.

It was the first naval-air battle of World War II.  Background  The Polish Navy of the Second Polish Republic (1919‚Äì39) was prepared mostly as means of supporting naval communications with France in case of a war with the Soviet Union. However, after it became apparent that the aggressive side would be Germany, and the entrance to the Baltic Sea would be blocked, three out of four Polish modern destroyers were withdrawn from the Baltic Sea to Great Britain in what was called Operation Peking. The remaining forces, consisting of one large minelayer, one destroyer, five submarines and smaller vessels were to execute two major naval operations, both aimed at disrupting the German naval movement in the area of the Danzig Bay and transit movement between Germany and East Prussia. All submarines were dispatched for their operational zones in the southern Baltic to take part in the Worek Plan, an attempt to sink as many German ships as possible.  Prelude  All the remaining surface vessels were to be dispatched from the naval base in Gdynia to Hel Peninsula, from where they were to start the so-called Operation Rurka. The plan was to lay a naval mine barrier between Hel Peninsula and Danzig to prevent any enemy ship from entering the area. At dusk ten Polish warships left Gdynia for Hel, located on the other side of the bay. There, the ships were to start the minelaying operation. They were as follows: large minelayer , minelaying minesweepers , , , , and and gunboats and Genera≈Ç Haller. The destroyer had left for its position earlier that day and did not partake in the battle. That afternoon a German reconnaissance aircraft spotted Gryf. Within half an hour a German airstrike was organized and launched.Williamson, D. G. Poland Betrayed: The Nazi-Soviet Invasions of 1939 p. 67-68  Battle  ORP Gryf While traversing Danzig Bay, the flotilla was surprised by a group of 33 German warplanes, mostly Junkers Ju 87B Stuka dive bombers. The German aircraft divided themselves into two groups and attacked. The Polish ships zig-zagged wildly to avoid being hit. Concentrated AA fire forced the planes to bomb from a higher altitude. The air raid was mostly unsuccessful and the Polish vessels suffered only minor losses. The backbone of the Polish flotilla, ORP Gryf with over 300 naval mines on board, remained unharmed. However, soon after the first air raid was repelled, the German bombers returned, around 18:00. There were no direct hits, but two Polish minelayers suffered damage from near misses and machine gun fire, ORP Gryf and ORP Mewa.Haar, Geirr H. The Gathering Storm 47. A near miss disabled Mewa, killing or wounding her 22 crewmen, so that she had to be taken in tow by Rybitwa. The commanding officer of ORP Gryf, Cmdr. Stefan Kwiatkowski, was killed by German machine gun fire, 29 of his men were wounded, and his ship's rudder was jammed. Gryfs executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. Wiktor ≈Åomidze assumed command. Fearing that her cargo of 300 mines was a liability, he ordered the munitions be thrown overboard.  Aftermath  ORP Gryf After the air raids, the Polish flotilla arrived at Hel. However, since ORP Gryf had abandoned all of its mines and was damaged, Operation Rurka had to be called off. ORP Wicher, did not receive the orders calling off the operation and went straight to the pre-designed zone of operations to cover the minelayers. At night, Wicher, commanded by Lt. Cdr. Stefan de Walden, spotted two German destroyers, and later a ship misidentified as a light cruiser, but did not attack, not wanting to compromise the operation. After return to Hel Peninsula, Wicher and Gryf were stripped of most of equipment and served as anti-aircraft platforms in the Hel naval base.

Matrix schemes are also sometimes considered similar to Ponzi or pyramid schemes. They have been called \\"unsustainable\\" by the United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading. A matrix scheme is also an example of an 'exploding queue' in queueing theory. History The first known matrix scheme is widely believed to be EZExpo.com, which started the popularity of matrix schemes in 2002. By 2003 more than 200 matrix schemes were in operation, including one which had the same owner as the payment processor StormPay (TymGlobal). Subsequently, both TymGlobal and StormPay were accused of running an illegal Ponzi scheme. StormPay later claimed to be independent of TymGlobal, and they stopped accepting matrix schemes as customers. Although many have since ceased trading, some schemes are still known to be operating worldwide. The payment processor, StormPay, is no longer trading. Operation The operation of matrix schemes varies, though they often operate similarly to pyramid or Ponzi schemes. Some of the former participants of these schemes consider them to be a form of confidence trick, although others are happy with their purchase. To move upward in the list, a person must wait for new members to join or refer a certain number of people to the list. This is accomplished through purchasing a token product of marginal value: usually e-books, cell phone boosters, screen savers, or other software CDs/DVDs. When a pre-defined number of people have purchased the token product, the person currently at the top of the list receives their reward item, and the next person in the list moves to the top. The rewards for those at the top of the matrix list are usually high-demand consumer electronics, such as portable digital audio players, high-definition television sets, laptops, and cellphones. Reaching the point on the list where one receives the expensive goods is termed \\"cycling\\". In many cases, the token product alone could not be reasonably sold for the price listed, and as such legal experts claim that, regardless of what is said, the real product being sold is the \\"reward\\" in question in those situations. In these cases, the operator could be charged with running a gambling game or failing to supply ordered products. Steven A. Richards, a lawyer who represents multi-level marketing (MLM) companies for Grimes & Reese in Idaho Falls, Idaho, has stated that often there are no clear legal tests for Ponzi schemes. But if the product sold has no value or very little value, and consumers wouldn't buy it without the attached gift, the scheme probably runs afoul of federal and state laws. The \\"Matrix List\\" by which the sites receive their name would be what is known as a straight-line matrix, or one-by-X matrix. This is similar to many MLMs that use Y-by-X matrices to fill a down-line. For example, one situation may be a one-by-10 matrix for a Sony PlayStation (a common reward). In such a matrix the site would usually sell an e-book for $50 to be placed on the list. After nine additional people purchased a spot, the first person would receive either a PlayStation or cash value equivalent and would be removed from the list. The person who had been second would move up to the first spot and an additional 10 people would have to purchase spots in order for that person to receive a PlayStation. It is this orderly movement which has also given the name \\"elevator scheme\\" to these sites, as people move up the \\"elevator\\" (escalator, ladder) to the top at which they would then \\"cycle\\" out of the matrix. In such a matrix, nine out of 10, or 90 percent, of all customers will not receive the reward item, because the rules of the scheme are that one reward is issued for every 10 customers that join. (The fact that the reward is issued to the customer at the top of the list doesn't change the proportion of rewards given to customers signed up.) Supporters claim that additional revenue streams from advertising are used to keep the lists moving. However, detractors claim that it is impossible to generate enough outside revenue. If the entire world were to join the list, 90 percent of the world would be unable to cycle if the site did not draw sufficient alternate revenue streams. Adding more people to the list does not change the fact that the majority would receive nothing without these streams. Additionally, the amount of time needed before a given individual will receive the product in question is often mistaken. In a matrix in which 10 people must sign up before cycling, the first person to join only needs nine additional sign-ups to cycle, but the second person needs 18 additional sign-ups: eight more for the person above him, and then 10 more for himself. The third person on the list likewise needs 27 additional signups: seven for the person on top of the list, 10 for the person directly above him, and then 10 for himself. The number of people required continues to grow for each new person joining the list. For the 10th person to cycle a total of 100 people would have to sign up, 1000 for the 100th, and so on. Through this process, the matrix scheme generates substantial profit for its organiser. At the time of its popularity, a PlayStation 2 cost a maximum of $299. After selling 10 $50 e-books, the organiser has made $500, and can purchase a PS2 for $299 to send to the first bidder while retaining a $201 profit. This same process repeats every time the matrix cycles. For example, if the matrix cycles 10 times, the organiser will have sold $5000 worth of e-books, of which $2990 will have been spent on 10 PS2s, leaving them with a profit of $2010. In queueing theory A matrix scheme is easily represented as a simple M/M/1 queue within the context of queueing theory. In such a system there is a Markovian arrival, Markovian service, and one single server.F. S. Hiller and G. J. Lieberman. Introduction to Operations Research. McGraw-Hill, New York, 1995 In the standard matrix queue, service rates are a function of arrival rates since the time to cycle out of the queue is based on the entry fee into the matrix from arriving members. Also, since members move through the matrix in single file, it is easy to associate the single server. The basic premise of queueing theory is that when arrival rates equal or exceed service rates, overall waiting time within the queue moves towards infinity.Hiller and Lieberman The basic formulation includes three formulae. The traffic intensity, œÅ, is the average arrival rate (Œª) divided by the average service rate (Œº): \\\\rho = \\\\lambda / \\\\mu The mean number of customers in the system (N): N = \\\\rho / (1 - \\\\rho) And the total waiting time within the queue (T): T = 1 / (\\\\mu - \\\\lambda ) It is possible to see that as arrival rates rise towards service rates, the total waiting time (T) and mean number of customers in the system (N) will move towards infinity. Since service time can never exceed the arrival time in the standard matrix, and total waiting time can only be defined if service times exceed arrival times, the only way for the matrix queue to reach stability is for outside income sources to exceed those being entered into the system. Legality Currently there are no laws specifically naming matrix schemes illegal in the US. However, the US Federal Trade Commission has issued warnings to the public about these sites. Additionally, the US Federal Trade Commission and the UK Trading Standards have issued warnings to the public regarding the ease with which these models can be manipulated for fraudulent purposes. Many of the original matrix sites, including EZExpo.com, are no longer in operation; some of them closed down while defending civil lawsuits. In 2003 EZExpo and several payment processors were sued in the civil courts for running an illegal lottery in the state of California, with the payment processors abetting the scam. However, the civil case is still ongoing. One result of the lawsuit is that those payment processors and some others no longer accept matrix schemes as customers. Currently, no legal precedent exists regarding the matrix scheme in the US. In the UK, the Office of Fair Trading has declared some of them to be illegal. On 1 July 2005, two matrix sites, pulsematrix.com and phones4everyone (themobilematrix.com), were declared to be running a form of illegal lottery. These two sites promptly closed down as part of a settlement agreement with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). Other similar matrix sites also used this decision to close down their sites. A few UK matrix sites carried on by utilising contractual law to trade legally, with one major site carrying on until May 2006 when it was sold to a company in Denmark. In the UK there is no specific law against matrix sites. Other countries may have different laws regarding these matrix sites, but information is unavailable at this time.

The town lies on the Nam Song River. The most notable feature of the area is the karst topography surrounding the town. History Vang Vieng was first settled around 1353 as a staging post between Luang Prabang and Vientiane. Originally named Mouang Song after the body of the deceased King Phra Nha Phao of Phai Naam was seen floating down the river, the town was renamed Vang Vieng during French colonial rule in the 1890s. Significant expansion of the town and its infrastructure occurred during the 1964-1973 Vietnam War when the US constructed an air force base and runway that was used by Air America. The airstrip was then called \\"Lima site 6\\". In more recent times, the town has grown substantially due to the influx of backpacker tourism due to the opportunities for adventure tourism in a limestone karst landscape. Climate Vang Vieng has a tropical monsoon climate according to the K√∂ppen climate classification, with a distinct dry season and a lengthy and rainy wet season, totalling about 3300 millimeters a year. The wet season lasts seven months, from April to October, and is characterized by high amounts of rainfall, which peaks in July with an average of 840 millimeters. The dry season spans November to March, and features cooler temperatures than during the rest of the year. The weather in Vang Vieng is coolest during the months of December and January, and hottest from March to May. Overall, the temperature ranges from an average low of 13.5 ¬∞C in January to an average high of 34 ¬∞C in April. Tourism Landscape, Vang Vieng Vang Vieng has become a backpacker-oriented town, with the main street featuring guest houses, bars, restaurants, internet cafes, and tour agencies. Attractions of the town include inner tubing and kayaking on the Nam Song River, which, until 2012, was lined with bars selling Beer Lao and Lao-Lao, and equipped with rope swings, zip lines, swimming and diving into blue lagoon, and large decks for socializing. Vang Vieng locals have organised themselves into a cooperative business association to sell tubing as an activity, in a system in which 1,555 participating households are divided into 10 village units, with each unit taking its turn on a ten-day rotation to rent inner-tubes to the tourists. Thanongsi Sorangkoun, owner of an organic farm in Vang Vieng, says that tubing inadvertently began in 1999 when he bought a few rubber tubes for his farm volunteers to relax on along the river. During the wet season, the river can be a series of rapids. Other activities include trekking and rock climbing in the limestone mountains. There are also numerous caves, such as Tham Phu Kham half an hour north of Vang Vieng by tuk-tuk or the Tham Non and Tham Jang caves closer to Vang Vieng. A market five kilometres north of town sells Lao textiles, household items, and foodstuffs. The town is on the main north‚Äìsouth highway, Route 13 from Luang Prabang to the capital, Vientiane. It is about eight hours by bus to Luang Prabang and four hours to Vientiane (152 km). Just a short walk from town are many ethnic Lao, Kmou, and Hmong villages, while Vang Vieng Organic Farm is around 4 km north of the town in the village of Phoudindaeng. There are opportunities for community involvement such as teaching, while it is also possible to stay in a house made of mud bricks at the organic farm. Wat Done Hor is the oldest of the five temples in Vang Vieng, built in 1903. =Impact of tourism= Due to the influx of backpackers, Vang Vieng locals have seen drastic changes in their community. In recent years, Vang Vieng has become a stop on the Southeast Asia backpacker circuit and the main street has many guest houses, bars, restaurants, internet cafes and tour agencies. There are concerns that the town is in danger of losing its charm as it becomes full of tourists, mushroom shakes, and episodes of Friends, a US sitcom shown in many bars. The New Zealand Herald wrote, \\"If teenagers ruled the world, it might resemble Vang Vieng\\". Safety measures for the tubing have been described as \\"non- existent\\". Tubing combined with heavy drinking has resulted in tourist drownings. It was reported that 22 tourists died on the river in 2011. The Lao government is planning to put more controls on the urban sprawl of Vang Vieng, while the Laos National Tourism Administration has \\"awareness programs\\" that ask tourists to \\"respect and strictly follow the rules, regulations, tradition and cultures of the Lao people\\", while also educating local people to maintain the Lao identity, way of life, tradition, and culture and not imitate tourist behaviour. Vang Vieng is known to have a problem with drugs, which are easily accessible to both tourists and local children. Locals have said that tubing and tourism are destroying the town's culture and encouraging crime among children, while loud music destroys the area's tranquility. A report on the future of tourism in Vang Vieng found that many budget tubers were \\"oblivious to, or uncaring about, the types of social, economic and environmental impact they are associated with.\\" A master plan for Vang Vieng notes that local grievances include pollution, inappropriate behaviour of tourists and environmental damage. Brett Dakin, the author of Another Quiet American, a chronicle of two years in Laos working for the tourist authority, said, \\"Each time a young Australian woman strolls down the street in a bikini, a bearded American smokes a joint on a guesthouse terrace, or a group of Koreans tumbles drunkenly out of a restaurant, it saps a little more of the essence of a town like Vang Vieng.\\" = Crime = As of June 2014, the US State Department says that although Laos generally has a low rate of violent crime, \\"some tourists have been robbed and sexually assaulted\\". Many restaurants in the Vang Vieng area offer menu items, particularly \\"pizzas\\", \\"shakes\\", or \\"teas\\" that may contain unknown substances or opiates. These products are often advertised as \\"happy\\" or \\"special\\" items. These unknown substances or opiates can be dangerous, causing serious illness or even death. = Tourist deaths and injuries = Vang Vieng's hospital recorded 27 tourist deaths in 2011 due to drowning or diving head first into rocks. Most fatalities occur on the same bar-heavy stretch of river that's less than 1 km long. In a 2012 interview with The Guardian newspaper, a senior doctor at the Vang Vieng Hospital, Dr Chit, said the overall figure is higher because \\"many fatalities are taken straight to Vientiane\\". In early 2012, two Australian backpackers died within a month. Dr Chit said 5 to 10 backpackers a day arrive at the local hospital with injuries such as broken bones or infected gashes, or sickness caused by alcohol intoxication or other drugs. \\"There are no safety measures or supervision, no helmets,\\" says Dr Chit. \\"We're not equipped to treat anything serious.\\" The Guardian reported that tourist deaths have brought a sense of bad karma for Laotian villagers living near the river. Today, local people avoid the river, once a part of everyday life for bathing, playing, fishing, and washing clothes. \\"We don't want to swim in the river any more,\\" explains La Phengxayya, 25, a primary school teacher in Phoudindaeng, the village closest to the tubing area. \\"We believe there are evil spirits in the water because so many young foreigners have died.\\". =Government crackdown = In the third quarter of 2012, the Lao government carried out a crackdown in Vang Vieng, pulling down all the riverside bars. Tubing is still going on, but in a much more controlled fashion. One climbing instructor was reported to have said that visitors are now spending more time participating in activities such as climbing, kayaking, and mountain biking. \\"Vang Vieng has come back to us again‚Ä¶ it's like it used to be\\", he was quoted as saying. The Bangkok Post reported that although the number of Westerners has dropped, visitors from Japan, China, and South Korea are on the rise, making up for the loss. The changing trend posed a new problem as tourists from Asia did not favour cheap accommodation and preferred more upmarket places, the report added.

Life and work  Raoult was born at Fournes, in the d√©partement of Nord. He became aspirant r√©p√©titeur at the Lyc√©e of Reims in 1853, and after holding several intermediate positions was appointed in 1862 to the professorship of chemistry in Sens lyc√©e. There he prepared a thesis on electromotive force which gained him a doctor's degree in Paris the following year. In 1867 Raoult was put in charge of chemistry classes at Grenoble, and three years later he succeeded to the chair of chemistry, which he held until his death in 1901. Raoult's earliest researches were physical in character, being largely concerned with the phenomena of the voltaic cell; later there was a period when more purely chemical questions engaged his attention. Raoult's name is best known in connection with work on solutions, to which he devoted the last two decades of his life. His first paper describing how solutes depressed the freezing points of solutions was published in 1878.F.-M. Raoult (1878) \\"Sur la tension de vapeur et sur le point de cong√©lation des solutions salines\\" (On vapor pressure and on the freezing point of saline solutions), Comptes rendus, 87 : 167-169. Further experiments with various solvents, such as benzene and acetic acid, in addition to water, led him to believe in a simple relation between the molecular weights of a solute and the freezing-point of a solution. He expressed the relationship as the loi g√©n√©rale de la cong√©lation (general law of freezing), that if one molecule of a substance be dissolved in 100 molecules of any given solvent, the temperature of solidification of the latter will be lowered by 0.63 ¬∞C. Another relation on which Raoult worked was that concerning the depression of a solvent's vapor pressure, due to a solute, showing that the decrease is proportional to the solute's molecular weight. This relationships holds best in the limiting case of a dilute solution.Note: * Raoult first stated his law in terms of the reduction of the freezing points of solutions: # F.-M. Raoult (1882) \\"Loi de cong√©lation des solutions benz√©niques des substances neutres\\" (Law of freezing of solutions of neutral substances in benzene), Comptes rendus, 95 : 187-189. From p. 189: \\"Il est donc permis de dire, d√®s √† pr√©sent: Dans une multitude de cas, l'abaissement du point de cong√©lation d'un dissolvant ne d√©pend que du rapport entre le nombres de mol√©cules du corps dissous et du dissolvant; il est ind√©pendant de la nature, du nombre, de l'arrangement des atomes qui composent les mol√©cules dissoutes.\\" (It is thus allowable to say, as of now: In the multitude of cases, the lowering of the freezing point of a solvent depends only on the relation between the number of molecules of the dissolved substance and of the solvent; it is independent of the nature, number, [or] arrangement of the atoms composing the dissolved molecules.) # In his next paper, Raoult specified (p. 1033) that in a solution containing one mole of solute per 100 moles of solvent, the freezing point is reduced by 0.62¬∞ C, regardless of the nature of solute or solvent. See: F.-M. Raoult (1882) \\"Loi g√©n√©rale de cong√©lation des dissolvants\\" (General law of the freezing of solvents), Comptes rendus, 95 : 1030-1033. English translation available on-line at: Le Moyne College * Raoult later stated his law in terms of the reduction of the vapor pressures of solutions: # F.-M. Raoult (1887) Loi g√©n√©rale des tensions de vapeur des dissolvants\\" (General law of vapor pressures of solvents), Comptes rendus, 104 : 1430-1433. # This reduction in vapor pressure had been predicted, via thermodynamic calculations, by two investigators: :* G√ºldberg (1870) \\"Sur la loi des points de cong√©lation des solutions salines\\" (On the law of freezing points of saline solutions), Comptes rendus, 70 : 1349-1352. :* J.

A condensed version of this article is available in English: J. van't Hoff (August 1888) \\"The function of osmotic pressure in the analogy between solutions and gases,\\" Philosophical Magazine, 5th series, 26 : 81-105. These two generalizations afforded a new method of determining the molecular weights of dissolved substances, and were utilized by Jacobus van 't Hoff and Wilhelm Ostwald, among other chemists, in support of the hypothesis of electrolytic dissociation in solutions. Raoult's freezing-point depression method became even more useful after it was improved by Ernst Otto Beckmann and became a standard technique for determining molecular weights of organic substances.By 1889, Beckmann had developed a convenient apparatus for measuring the increase in the boiling points of solutions.

Elders or spiritual fathers are charismatic spiritual leaders whose wisdom stems from God as obtained from ascetic experience. It is believed that through ascetic struggle, prayer and Hesychasm (seclusion or withdrawal), the Holy Spirit bestows special gifts onto the elder including the ability to heal, prophesy, and most importantly, give effective spiritual guidance and direction. Elders are looked upon as being an inspiration to believers and an example of saintly virtue, steadfast faith, and spiritual peace. Elders are not appointed by any authority; they are simply recognized by the faithful as being people \\"of the Spirit\\". An elder, when not in prayer or in voluntary seclusion, receives visitors (some who travel very far) and spends time conversing with them, offering a blessing (if the elder is an ordained cleric) and confession, and praying. People often petition the elder for intercessionary prayers, believing that the prayer of an elder is particularly effective. Personal confessions to elders are encouraged, although not all of them are ordained to the priesthood. Many of them have a reputation among believers of being able to know the secrets of a person's heart without having ever previously met the visitor, and having the ability to discern God's plan for a person's life. This, as all of the elder's gifts, is believed to come from the Holy Spirit acting through the elder. Derivation, history and application Hieromonk Amphilochius (1749-1824) Martha Shestova (1560-1631) The institution may be traced to the beginnings of Christian monasticism in the 4th century. The original Greek term geron (meaning \\"elder\\", as in gerontology) was rendered by the Russian word starets, from Old Church Slavonic starƒ≠tsƒ≠, \\"elder\\", derived from star≈≠, \\"old\\". The Greek tradition has a long unbroken history of elders and disciples, such as Sophronius and John Moschos in the seventh century, Symeon the Elder and Symeon the New Theologian in the eleventh century, and contemporary charismatic gerontes such as Porphyrios and Paisios. Sergius of Radonezh and Nil Sorsky were two most venerated startsy of Old Muscovy. The revival of elders in the Slavic world is associated with the name of Paisius Velichkovsky (1722-1794), who produced the Church Slavonic translation of selected texts of the Philokalia. The most famous Russian starets of the early 19th century was Seraphim of Sarov (1759-1833), who went on to become one of the most revered Orthodox saints. The Optina Pustyn near Kozelsk used to be celebrated for its startsy (Schema-Archimandrite Moses, Schema-Hegumen Anthony, Hieroschemamonk Leonid, Hieroschemamonk Macarius, Hieroschemamonk Hilarion, Hieroschemamonk Ambrose, Hieroschemamonk Anatole (Zertsalov)).Optina Elders in English version of Orthodox Portal \\"Pravoslavie.ru\\" Such writers as Nikolay Gogol, Aleksey Khomyakov, Leo Tolstoy and Konstantin Leontyev sought advice from the elders of this monastery. They also inspired the figure of Zosima in Dostoyevsky's novel The Brothers Karamazov. Grigori Rasputin was styled starets by his followers, although he was not generally recognised as one. A more modern example of a starets is Archimandrite John Krestiankin (1910-2006) of the Pskov Monastery of the Caves who was popularly recognized as such by many Orthodox living in Russia. The concept of the elder may be familiar to many Western readers through J. D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey. In the novel, one of the characters refers to the 19th century anonymous Russian work, The Way of a Pilgrim. The title character of The Way of a Pilgrim (ostensibly, the author) is advised in the progress of his spiritual life by an elder, who uses the Jesus Prayer as a starting point for spiritual discipline. Other meanings In Bulgarian and several other southern Slavic languages the word translates literally to \\"old man\\". A word with a meaning closer to the translation in Russian would be stareishina ().

Crops grown around the lake include wheat, rice, cotton, maize, alfalfa, fruit, grapes, and vegetables. The reservoir, together with the Volga-Don Canal and the lower course of the Don, provides an important waterway between the Volga River / Caspian Sea basin and the Sea of Azov. The Tsimlyansk Dam also provides flood control for the lower Don River basin. Completion of the lake resulted in strong local industrial growth. In particular, the city of Volgodonsk owes its existence to the Tsimlyansk Dam project. Under the waters lies the ancient Khazar fortress town of Sarkel.

Biography Vitalis was a wealthy citizen of Milan, perhaps a soldier. He was married to Saint Valeria. They are supposed to have been the parents of the (perhaps legendary) Saints Gervasius and Protasius. According to legend, when he encouraged Saint Ursicinus of Ravenna to be steadfast at his execution, Vitalis was discovered to be a Christian. A judge named Paulinus ordered Vitalis to be racked and then buried alive.Webster, Douglas Raymund. \\"St. Vitalis.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 24 Jan. 2014 The date of his martyrdom is uncertain: some sources say that he was a victim of Nero, others of Marcus Aurelius. He was martyred in Ravenna, but all else in the story is suspect. Some writers argue that he may have been a character in a work of fiction that was mistaken for history. Veneration The feast of Saint Vitalis occurs on April 28.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001, ) Churches are dedicated in honor of Saint Vitalis at Rome, Faenza, Rimini, Como, Ferrara, Venice, and Verona in Italy and at Jadera (now Zadar) in Dalmatia (now Croatia), but by far the most famous church bearing his name is the octagonal Basilica of San Vitale at Ravenna, a masterpiece of Byzantine art, erected on the purported site of his martyrdom. He is also the patron saint of Granarolo and Marittima in Italy, as well as of Thibodaux, Louisiana, in the United States. The Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral recognizes Saint Vitalis as its patron. A Mass to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Cebu's elevation to an archdiocese and the feast day of Vitalis was held on 28 April 2009, with the Archbishop of Cebu Cardinal Ricardo Vidal presiding.

Her managers then arranged her into a marriage with a Sarangi player employed by the troupe whom her mother only knew as Miyan Jaan. Later on, it is speculated that Daleepabai began a relationship with a married lawyer with the approval of her husband who lived in the same haveli as her. Miyan Jaan died when she was five. Jaddanbai moved to the city and became a singer but had difficulty due to her lack of formal training. She later approached Shrimant Ganpat Rao (Bhaiya Saheb Scindia) of Calcutta and became his student. Shrimant Ganpat Rao died in 1920 while she was still a student, so she completed her training under Ustad Moinuddin Khan. Later she also trained with Ustad Chaddu Khan Saheb and Ustad Laab Khan Saheb. Her music became popular and she became an even more famous courtesan than her mother.Connections Between The Dutt & Nehru-Gandhi Families - Mouthshut Reporting She began recording ghazals with the Columbia Gramophone Company. She started participating in music sessions and was invited by the rulers of many princely states such as Rampur, Bikaner, Gwalior, Jammu and Kashmir, Indore, and Jodhpur to perform mehfils. She had also rendered songs and ghazals at various radio stations nationwide. She later began acting when the Play Art Photo Tone Company of Lahore approached her for a role in their movie Raja Gopichand in 1933. She played the role of the mother of the title character. Later she worked for a Karachi based film company, in Insaan ya Shaitan. She worked in two more movies, Prem Pariksha and Seva Sadan, before starting her own production company called Sangeet Films. The company produced Talashe Haq in 1935, in which she acted and composed the music. She also introduced her daughter Nargis as a child artist. In 1936 she acted in, directed, and wrote the music for Madam Fashion. Personal life Her first marriage was with a wealthy Gujarati Hindu businessman Narottamdas (\\"Bachhubhai\\" or \\"Bachi Babu\\") Khatri. Khatri converted to Islam upon marriage and together they had a son, Akhtar Hussain. Her second marriage was with harmonium master Ustaad Irshad Meer Khan, a frequent collaborator, who sired her second son, actor Anwar Hussain. Her third marriage was to Mohanchand Uttamchand (\\"Mohan Babu\\") Tyagi, a wealthy Punjabi Mohyal Brahmin Hindu heir who converted to Islam and adopted the name Abdul Rashid. Film actress Nargis (n√©e Fatima Rashid) was their daughter. Abdul Rashid spent most of his days idle, with Jaddanbai being the main breadwinner during their time together. Despite being a nominal Muslim and her husband formally converting to Islam, Jaddanbai and her family practiced aspects of Hinduism, fluctuating between a Hindu and Muslim identity.

Hubbert curves predict that the production curves of non-renewing resources approximate a bell curve. Thus, according to this theory, when the peak of production is passed, production rates enter an irreversible decline. The United States Energy Information Administration predicted in 2006 that world consumption of oil will increase to (mbd) in 2015 and 118 million barrels per day in 2030. With 2009 world oil consumption at 84.4 mbd, reaching the projected 2015 level of consumption would represent an average annual increase between 2009 and 2015 of 2.7% per year.  Resource availability  World proved reserves of crude oil, 1980-2012 (US EIA) Ratio of world proved oil reserves to production, 1980-2011 (UN EIA) The World's natural oil supply is fixed because petroleum is naturally formed far too slowly to be replaced at the rate at which it is being extracted. Over many millions of years, plankton, bacteria, and other plant and animal matter became buried in sediments on the ocean floor. When conditions were right ‚Äì a lack of oxygen for decomposition, and sufficient depth and temperature of burial ‚Äì these organic remains were converted into petroleum compounds, while the sediment accompanying them was converted into sandstone, siltstone, and other porous sedimentary rock. When capped by impermeable rocks such as shale, salt, or igneous intrusions, they formed the petroleum reservoirs which are exploited today.Abhijit Y. Dandekar. Petroleum reservoir rock and fluid properties. CRC Press, 2006. p. 1. Production decline models For the short and medium-term, oil production decline occurs in a predictable manner based on geological circumstances, governmental policies, and engineering practices. The shape of the decline curve varies depending upon whether one considers a well, a field, or a set of fields. In the longer term, technological developments have defied some of the predictions. =Oil well production decline= Theoretical oil production curve for a well with exponential decline An individual oil well usually produces at its maximum rate at the start of its life; the production rate eventually declines to a point at which it no longer produces profitable amounts. The shape of the decline curve depends on the oil reservoir and the reservoir drive mechanism. Wells in water-drive and gas-cap drive reservoirs often produce at a near constant rate until the encroaching water or expanding gas cap reaches the well, causing a sudden decline in oil production. Wells in gas solution drive and oil expansion drive reservoirs have exponential or hyperbolic declines: rapid declines at first, then leveling off.Norman J. Hyne, Nontechnical Guide to Petroleum Geology (Tulsa: PennWell, 2012) 435-437. The shape of production curve of an oil well can also be affected by a number of nongeologic factors: :* Well may be restricted by choice by lack of market demand or government regulation. This decreases the rate of decline, but will not change the well's total production significantly. :* Hydraulic fracturing (fracking) or acidizing may be used to cause a sharp spike in production, and may increase the recoverable reserves of a given well. :* The field may undergo a secondary or tertiary recovery project, discussed in the next section. =Oil field production decline= Individual oil wells are typically within multi-well oil fields. As with individual wells, the production curves for oil fields vary depending on geology and how they are developed and produced. Some fields have symmetric bell-shaped production profiles, but it is more common that the period of inclining production is briefer and steeper than the subsequent decline. More than half the production usually occurs after a field has reached a peak or plateau.Richard Miller and others, Decline Rates and Depletion Rates , UK Energy Research Centre, Tech Report 4, of \\"Review of Evidence for Global Oil depletion\\". Production profiles of many fields show distinct peaks, but for giant oil fields, it is more common for production to reach and maintain a plateau before declining. Once a field declines, it usually follows an exponential decline.Mikael Hook, May 2009, Depletion and Decline Curve Analysis in Crude Oil Production, Licentiate Thesis, Department for Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala University, p.70. As this decline levels off, production can continue at relatively low rates. A number of oil fields in the U.S. have been producing for over 100 years. Pennenergy.com history for McClintock No. 1 oil well which began first producing oil in August 1861. Florence Field, near Canon City, Colorado, was discovered in 1876. Oil field production curves can be modified by a number of factors: :* Production may be restricted by market conditions or government regulation. :* A secondary recovery project, such as water or gas injection, can repressurize the field and increase the total recovery. :* the field may undergo an enhanced oil recovery project, such as drilling of wells for injection of solvents, carbon dioxide, or steam. This allows more oil to be coaxed out of the rock, increasing the ultimate production of the field. =Multi-field production decline= Hubbert-theory graph of multiple oil field production Most oil is found in a small number of very large oil fields. According to Hubbert peak theory, production starts off slowly, rises faster and faster, then slows down and flattens until it reaches a peak, after which production declines. In the late stage, production often enters a period of exponential decline in which the decline becomes less and less steep. Oil production may never actually reach zero, but eventually becomes very low. Factors which can modify this curve include: :* Inadequate demand for oil, which reduces steepness of the curve and pushes its peak into the future. :* Sharp price increases when the production peak is reached, as production fails to meet demand. If price increases cause a sharp drop in demand, a dip in the top of the curve may occur. :* Development of new drilling technology or marketing of unconventional oil can reduce the steepness of the decline as more oil is produced than initially anticipated. =United States production= Oil production in the United States, provided one excludes Alaska, began by following the theoretical Hubbert curve for a few decades but is now deviating strongly from it. U.S. oil production reached a peak in 1970 and by the mid-2000s it had fallen to 1940s levels. In 1950, the United States produced over half the world's oil, but by 2005 that proportion had dropped to about 8%. In 2005, U.S. crude oil imports peaked at a rate twice as high as domestic production; since then, U.S. oil production has increased, and imports have fallen 41%.US Energy Information Administration, US net imports of crude oil. The production peak in 1970 was predicted by one of the two projections put forward in 1956 by Hubbert. By 1972 all import quotas and controls on U.S. domestic production had been removed. Despite this, and despite the quadrupling of prices during the 1973 oil crisis, the production decline was not reversed in the lower 48 states until 2009. Crude oil production has since risen sharply from 2009 through 2014, so that the rate of US oil production in October 2014 was 81% higher than the average rate in 2008.US Energy Information Administration, US crude oil production. The actual U.S. production curve deviates from Hubbert's 1956 curve in significant ways: :* When oil surpluses created a glut on the market and low prices began causing demand and production curves to rise, regulatory agencies such as the Texas Railroad Commission stepped in to restrain production. :* The curve peaked at a higher rate and sharper point than predicted. :* Production fell after 1970, but started to recover and reached a lower secondary peak in 1988. This occurred because the supergiant Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska was only discovered in 1968, and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) was not completed until 1977. After 1988, Alaska production peaked and total U.S. production began to decline again. By 2005, Prudhoe Bay had produced over 75% of its oil. :* Production increases in the 2010s File:Texas Oil Production 1935-2012.pngTexas oil field production decline curve File:Alaska Oil Production 1975 to 2005.pngAlaska oil production decline curve File:US Crude Oil Production versus Hubbert Curve.pngHistorical US crude oil production showing initial similarity to a Hubbert curve File:Decline curve analysis software image of exponential decline - hyperbolic decline.jpgIndividual oil well decline curve generated by decline curve analysis software, utilized in petroleum economics to indicate the depletion of oil & gas in a Petroleum reservoir. The Y axis is a log scale. Oil production (green line), and gas production (red line). File:Revisions to US Oil Reserves 2011.pngAlthough US proved oil reserves grew by 3.8 billion barrels in 2011, even after deducting 2.07 billion barrels of production, only 8 percent of the 5.84 billion barrels of the newly booked oil was due to new field discoveries (US EIA) =World oil production= World oil field production curve The 1970 production peak in the U.S. caused many people to begin to question when the world production peak would occur. The peak of world production is known as Peak oil. Implications of a world peak A peak in oil production could result in a worldwide oil shortage, or it could not even be noticed as demand decreases in conjunction with increased prices. While past shortages stemmed from a temporary insufficiency of supply, crossing Hubbert's Peak would mean that the production of oil would continue to decline, and that demand for these products must be reduced to meet supply. The effects of such a shortage would depend on the rate of decline and the development and adoption of effective alternatives. =Catastrophe= The use of fossil fuels allows humans to participate in takedown, which is the consumption of energy at a greater rate than it is being replaced. The industrial economy is currently heavily dependent on oil as a fuel and chemical feedstock. For example, over 90% of transportation in the United States relies on oil. Since the 1940s, agriculture has dramatically increased its productivity, due largely to the use of chemical pesticides, fertilizers, and increased mechanisation. This process has been called the Green Revolution. The increase in food production has allowed world population to grow dramatically over the last 50 years. Pesticides rely upon oil as a critical ingredient, and fertilizers require natural gas. Farm machinery also requires oil. Most or all of the uses of fossil fuels in agriculture can be replaced with alternatives. For example, by far the biggest fossil fuel input to agriculture is the use of natural gas as a hydrogen source for the Haber-Bosch fertilizer-creation process. Natural gas is used simply because it is the cheapest currently available source of hydrogen; were that to change, other sources, such as electrolysis powered by solar energy, could be used to provide the hydrogen for creating fertilizer without relying on fossil fuels. Oil shortages may force a move to lower input \\"organic agriculture\\" methods, which may be more labor-intensive and require a population shift from urban to rural areas, reversing the trend towards urbanisation which has predominated in industrial societies; however, some organic farmers using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming, but without the use of fossil-fuel-intensive artificial fertilizers or pesticides.Comparison of Organic and Conventional Corn, Soybean, Alfalfa, Oats, and Rye Crops at the Neely-Kinyon LTAR Site-2001 Another possible effect would derive from modern transportation and housing infrastructure. A large proportion of the developed world's population live in suburbs, a type of low-density settlement designed with the automobile in mind. A movement to deal with this problem early, called \\"New Urbanism,\\" seeks to develop the suburbs into higher density neighborhoods and use high density, mixed-use forms for new building projects. =Recession= A more modest scenario, assuming a slower rate of depletion or a smoother transition to alternative energy sources, could still cause substantial economic hardship such as a recession or depression due to higher energy prices. Inflation has also been linked to oil price spikes. However, economists disagree on the strength and causes of this association. See Energy crisis. =Rising food prices= Rising oil prices cause rising food prices in three ways. First, increased equipment fuel costs drive higher prices. Second, transportation costs increase retail prices. Third, higher oil prices are causing farmers to switch from producing food crops to producing biofuel crops. Food versus fuel debate escalatesHow Food and Fuel Compete for Land by Lester Brown ‚Äì The Globalist - Global Energy The law of supply and demand predicts that if fewer farmers are producing food the price of food will rise. Replacement An alternative considered likely by some is that oil will be replaced with renewable energy during the first half of the 21st century.A Plan to Power 100 Percent of the Planet with Renewables The replacement fuel would likely be hydrogen. A hydrogen economy would then replace the current oil-based economy. Another possible replacement fuel is biogas, which is composed of methane. Methane has boiling point of ‚àí161 ¬∞C, rather than hydrogen's -252.87 ¬∞C, making methane a much easier fuel to condense. Other people consider that the whole idea of \\"the hydrogen economy\\" is flawed. Compressed hydrogen has an energy density of only 5.6 megajoules per liter. Robert Zubrin looks at the practical problems of using hydrogen as an energy storage medium in Energy Victory: Winning the War on Terror by Breaking Free of Oil. He considers that hydrogen is a very poor form of storage, and that batteries, methanol or dimethyl ether would be better. This point is reiterated in Beyond Oil and Gas: The Methanol Economyby George A Olah, Aiain Goeppert, G. K. Surya Prakash, and in David MacKay's book described below. Geothermal power is one source of sustainable energy that can produce hydrogen. Note that David MacKay has shown in his book Sustainable Energy: Without the Hot Air, chapter 16 that geothermal can only provide a tiny fraction of the world's needs sustainably. In some areas located over geological hotspots (such as Iceland), geothermal makes more sense. Solar energy is a source of inexhaustible energy. There is more solar energy that reaches the surface of the Earth each hour than the amount of energy consumed by the world in a year.Solar Energy Facts The challenges of using the sun's energy ‚Äì energy which can be obtained either from wind power or from solar power ‚Äì is that the energy needs to either be (1) stored in physical form of fuel for when it can be used in the future, or (2) transported directly as electricity, through transmission lines. Neither is dispatchable, as there is no control over when the sun will shine or when the wind will blow. There are, however, concentrated solar power plants using thermal storage that can store energy efficiently for up to 24 hours.

It is made with a fermented batter derived from rice and split chickpeas. Dhokla can be eaten for breakfast, as a main course, as a side dish, or as a snack. Dhokla is very similar to Khaman, however Dhokla is made of batter derived from mixture of rice flour and chickpea flour, whereas Khaman is typically made from Chickpeas gram and looks yellow in color. Khaman has become widely popular outside Gujarat but is misunderstood or incorrectly known as Dhokla.  History  Dukkia, a pulse- based precursor of the dhokla, is mentioned in a Jain text dated to 1066 CE. The earliest extant work to mention the word \\"dhokla\\" is the Gujarati Varanaka Samuchaya (1520 CE). Preparation Rice and split chickpeas (chana dal), in a particular ratio (to achieve the desired texture and taste) are soaked overnight. The mixture is ground, and the paste is fermented for four to five hours or overnight. This is spiced by adding chili pepper, Coriander, ginger and baking soda. The fermented batter is then steamed for about 15 minutes on a flat dish and cut into pieces. These chopped pieces are seasoned in hot oil with mustard seeds. Asafoetida and chopped green chillies can also be fried and, sometimes, an equal amount of water. The pieces are then removed from dish. Sometimes it is also fried in hot oil with cumin seeds. It is usually served with deep fried chillies and chutney made from coriander. It is garnished with coriander and often with grated coconut. Another method is to steam the fermented batter for 10 to 15 minutes on plates placed inside a container that does not allow steam to escape. To avoid steam water falling on the batter during preparation, a cloth may be placed inside the container. The plates are not directly placed on the base, or the batter will burn, so a small stand is used. When the batter is steamed properly, the plates are taken out of the container and then served with raw oil poured over the dhokla, or used as dip. Other ingredients like curd, tomato sauce, garlic paste, or coriander paste may be used in serving, however none of these are traditionally eaten with dhokla. Types of Dhokla In contrast to Dhokla, Khaman is made entirely of chickpea batter. Besan dhokla There are different kinds of dhokla prepared with different ingredients and ratios of chickpeas. Some of the popular kinds of dhoklas are: * Khatta dhokla * Rasia dhokla * Moong dal dhokla *Khandavi dhokla * Cheese dhokla *Toor dal dhokla *Dhokla made in ovenSandwich dhokla *Rava dhokla * Mixed dal dhokla *Green peas dhokla * Meetha dhokla *Besan dhokla *Khaman dhokla Khaman is a similar gram flour- based food. Whereas dhokla is made with rice and chickpeas, khaman is made from chickpeas only. It is generally lighter in color and softer than dhokla. To make dhokla, a small proportion of baking soda is added while to make khaman more baking soda is added to make it more fluffy, spongy and porous. Idada/Edada is another variety of dhokla, which is made by using different lentils like black grams, also known as urad dal, instead of chickpeas. Dhokla is very commonly used as a breakfast or as a snack in western parts of India including Madhya Pradesh, though nowadays it's available in every Indian state. It is an easy to cook and easy to digest snack.

Don Agustin Fernando Mu√±oz y S√°nchez (4 May 180811 September 1873), Duke of Ri√°nsares and Montmorot, Marquis of San Agust√≠n, was the second and morganatic husband of Maria Christina, Regent of Spain. Early life Mu√±oz was born at Taranc√≥n, in the Province of Cuenca, in New Castile. His father was the keeper of an estanco or office for the sale of the tobacco of the government monopoly. Marriage to the Regent of Spain Mu√±oz enlisted in the royal bodyguard, and attracted the attention of Maria Christina. According to one account, he distinguished himself by stopping the runaway horses of her carriage; according to another, he only picked up her handkerchief; a third and scandalous explanation of his fortune has been given. Maria Christina's husband, King Ferdinand VII of Spain died on 28 September 1833, and on 29 December 1833 she and Mu√±oz were privately married. The Duke of Ri√°nsares If Maria Christina had officially made the marriage public, she would have forfeited the regency; but her relations with Mu√±oz were perfectly well known within the Spanish court. When on 13 August 1836 the soldiers on duty at the summer palace La Granja mutinied and forced the regent to grant a constitution, it was generally, though wrongly, believed that they overcame her reluctance by seizing Mu√±oz, whom they called her guapo, or fancy man, and threatening to shoot him. In 1840 Maria Christina found her position intolerable; she renounced the regency and left Spain with Mu√±oz. In 1842 Maria Christina purchased the Ch√¢teau de Malmaison as their residence. In 1843, on the overthrow of General Baldomero Espartero they returned to Spain. Public recognition of the marriage In 1844, Mu√±oz's stepdaughter Queen Isabella II was declared to be of age. On 23 June 1844 Isabella gave to Mu√±oz the title duque de Ri√°nsares, to which was attached a Grandeza de Espa√±a;Elenco de Grandezas y T√≠tulos Nobilarios Espa√±oles. Madrid: Ediciones Hidalguia, 1996; . the title came from the river √Ånsares, near Mu√±oz's birthplace in Taranc√≥n. On 12 October 1844 Isabella gave official consent to the marriage between her mother and Mu√±oz, and it was publicly performed. In 1846 Isabella made Mu√±oz a Knight of the Golden Fleece. On 30 May 1846 she gave Mu√±oz a second title, marqu√©s de San Agust√≠n. Mu√±oz was made a Captain General, the highest rank in the Spanish Army. In 1847 Louis Philippe, King of the French, gave Mu√±oz the title duc de Montmorot; he also invested Mu√±oz with the Grand Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur. Until driven from Spain with Maria Christina by the revolutionary movement of 1854, Mu√±oz is credibly reported to have applied himself to making a large fortune out of railway concessions and by judicious stock exchange speculations. Of political ambitions he had none. All authorities agree that he was not only good- looking, but kind and well-bred. Mu√±oz died in 1873, five years before his wife, at his home, Villa Mon D√©sir in Le Havre, near Sainte-Adresse, in France. His remains are buried in the crypt of the Santuario de Nuestra Se√±ora de Ri√°nsares, several kilometres outside Taranc√≥n. Children Mu√±oz and Maria Christina had several children: * Mar√≠a Amparo Mu√±oz, 1st Countess of Vista Alegre (17 November 183419 August 1864) married Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw Czartoryski (1828‚Äì1894) * Maria de los Milagros Mu√±oz, 1st Marchioness of Castillejo (8 November 18359 July 1903) married to Filippo del Drago, Principe di Mazzano e d'Antuni (1824‚Äì1913). * Agust√≠n Mu√±oz, 1st Duke of Taranc√≥n (15 March 183715 July 1855) *Fernando Mu√±oz, 2nd Duke of Taranc√≥n and Riansares (27 April 18387 December 1910) married to Eladia Bernaldo de Quir√≥s y Gonzalez de Cienfuegos (1839‚Äì1909). * Mar√≠a Cristina Mu√±oz, Marchioness of La Isabella (19 April 184020 December 1921) married to Jose Maria Bernaldo de Quir√≥s y Gonzalez de Cienfuegos, Marques de Campo Sagrado (1840‚Äì1911). * Juan Mu√±oz, Count of Recuerdo (29 August 18442 April 1863) * Jos√© Mu√±oz, Count of Gracia (21 December 184617 December 1863) References Further reading * Garrido Gallego, Jes√∫s.

It is the second part of a two-part story. The first part, \\"The Impossible Planet\\", was broadcast on 3 June. The episode is set on Krop Tor, a planet orbiting a black hole. In the episode, the alien time traveller the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) climbs down a deep pit in which the Beast (Gabriel Woolf) is kept prisoner. At the same time, the Doctor's travelling companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and a human expedition team try to escape the planet after the Beast possesses the Ood on the base. Plot The Doctor and science officer Ida investigate a pit under a recently opened trapdoor deep below the planet Krop Tor. In the sanctuary base, Rose and three of the surviving members of the crew, Jefferson, Danny and Toby, flee from the advancing Ood, who are all possessed by the Beast. Toby appears to be no longer possessed by the Beast. As the Doctor and Ida prepare to return to the base, the Beast communicates with the Doctor and the rest of the crew through the Ood and explains that he was sealed in the pit before the universe began. The Beast demoralises the Doctor, Rose, and the crew. The lift cable snaps shortly after, trapping Ida and the Doctor 10 miles underground. With Zach cornered in the base control room by Ood, Rose and the rest of the crew go into the maintenance tunnel. However, the Ood are in pursuit, so Zach seals off the junction. Rose, Jefferson, Danny and Toby go to incapacitate the Ood by disrupting the telepathic field that keeps them functioning. After the group reunites with Zach, Zach knocks out the unwilling Rose and takes her with them to board the escape rocket and leave the planet. Meanwhile, the Doctor and Ida use the lift cable to explore the pit, although the Doctor finds nothing but darkness far below. He then chooses to detach himself and fall, landing at the bottom thanks to an air cushion and finds that he can breathe. The Doctor finds the physical form of the Beast. He quickly deduces from the unintelligible grunts coming from the Beast that its consciousness has already escaped and that Krop Tor was designed as the perfect prison for the Beast: its jailers devised the jars as a failsafe, since their destruction would cause the planet to plunge into the black hole. The Doctor smashes the jars anyway to destroy the Beast. As the planet falls out of orbit, the Doctor stumbles across his TARDIS. The rocket is also pulled towards the black hole, and Toby reveals the mind of the Beast is still possessing him. Rose takes Zach's bolt gun and shoots out the rocket's front window, unhooking Toby's safety harness to jettison him into space. Meanwhile, the Doctor rescues Ida and tows the rocket to safety with the TARDIS. He returns Ida to the rocket, but did not have time to save the Ood. Production Russell T Davies said that in order to inspire the design of the Beast, he sent the visual designers at The Mill images of paintings by Simon Bisley, a comics artist known for muscular grotesqueries. In the episode commentary, Davies said that an early draft of the script called for the role of the Ood to be filled by the same species as the Slitheen. Their race would have been enslaved and they wished to awaken the Beast, whom they believed to be a god that could free them. Davies claims credit for naming the Ood as a play on the word \\"odd\\". According to the DVD commentary, the final scene in the TARDIS where the Doctor says \\"the stuff of legend\\" was the last major scene shot for the 2006 series, and the last to feature Billie Piper (whose actual final episode had been filmed weeks earlier). It was not, however, the very last scene filmed for the season, which was the \\"cliffhanger\\" scene at the very end of \\"Doomsday\\". Davies also mentioned that one of many unused ideas for a creature in this episode would be used in series three; this turned out to be the Toclafane from \\"The Sound of Drums\\"/\\"Last of the Time Lords\\", as revealed via Davies's comments in Doctor Who Magazine Series Three Companion. Broadcast and DVD release This episode was shown the Saturday after 6/6/06, with the first part airing the Saturday before, hence it bookmarked a week full of Devil- related stories in the media. Overnight ratings for \\"The Satan Pit\\" came in at 5.5 million viewers. This could be explained by the unusually hot country-wide weather, combined with the first England game of the 2006 World Cup. \\"The Satan Pit\\" had an audience share of 35%, meaning that its overall share has remained static and it was the third-most-watched programme of the day, after the World Cup game and Casualty. The final consolidated rating was 6.08 million, the lowest of any episode of Doctor Who since the show was revived in 2005. The audience Appreciation Index for the episode was 86. This episode and \\"The Impossible Planet\\" were released in the UK, together with \\"Love & Monsters\\", as a basic DVD with no special features on 7 August 2006. It was re-released as part of the Complete Series 2 box set on 20 November 2006 with a commentary by James Strong, Mike Jones and Ranny Jhutti. IGN's Ahsan Haque gave \\"The Satan Pit\\" a score of 8.7 out of 10. He was generally positive and praised the CGI that animated the Beast, though he noted that the Doctor made some \\"logical leaps\\". Dave Golder of SFX felt that the ambition of the story could not live up to production values, but he praised Tennant and Piper. While he found some \\"scripting misfires\\" like the easy recovery of the TARDIS, he described the story as \\"action-packed, ambitious, emotionally draining and, thankfully, still willfully different to every other SF show out there.\\" Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing was more critical, giving \\"The Satan Pit\\" a grade of C+. He found it a disappointing conclusion which spent too much time getting the Doctor to the monster, only for him to confront it by \\"ranting and raving rather embarrassingly at a roaring CGI effect.\\" He also criticised the Doctor's concentration on saving Rose without mentioning the other characters, and noted that a few previously unseen crew members appeared and that \\"entire plot threads also go nowhere\\". Still, he praised the acting of the guest cast, the music, and the effects, concluding that the two-parter was \\"a qualified success that offers solid character, brilliant visual design and some thought- provoking moments damaged only by poor plotting and some glaring missed opportunities\\".

The film was directed by Leigh Jason based on a screenplay by Ernest Pagano and Dalton Trumbo.Nixon, Rob. \\"Articles: The Flying Irishman (1939)\\". Turner Classic Movies. The Flying Irishman covers the material of Corrigan's autobiography, That's My Story, from his early life to his return from his wrong-way flight. Because of the huge popularity of Corrigan and his flight, the screenplay assumes that the material is already familiar to its audience.Corrigan 1938, p. 6. Plot Douglas Corrigan as himself in the lead role. In 1938, an unlikely event unfolds as pilot Douglas Corrigan returns to the United States after his transatlantic flight, made \\"the wrong way\\" across the Atlantic. The passion to fly was there from an early age as young Douglas faced some hardships as his parents separated, leaving his mother (Dorothy Peterson) to rear two sons and a daughter. When his mother dies, Douglas becomes the family breadwinner, putting his brother Henry (Eddie Quillan) through college. With his own funds, he becomes partners with his friend Butch (Paul Kelly), an experienced pilot, in the purchase of an aircraft. Doug aspires to attain a pilot's job, but increasing regulation of commercial aviation keeps putting the job beyond his grasp: by the time he gains the experience required, the qualification standards have been increased again. After a series of setbacks, including losing his aircraft in a crash and seeing the qualification requirements include a college degree beyond his means, Doug begins to plan an audacious feat, flying across the Atlantic just like Charles Lindbergh (who also did not have a college education), to prove his exceptional ability. After earning enough money as a welder to purchase and modify a second-hand aircraft, Doug goes into business with Henry as a barn-stormer to finance a transatlantic attempt, but Henry eventually tires of the drudgery of eking out a living day to day. Doug learns about a new commercial airline route to Ireland and decides to make a solo flight to prove his qualifications. In New York, after his plane is grounded by an inspector, Doug's brother arranges a return flight to San Diego, lifting the flight ban. Once in the air, Doug instead heads off to Ireland, and, 28 hours later, makes it successfully to Dublin. When Doug rejects an airline offer of a job as vice-president and chief pilot because he only wants to be a pilot, he is told that his goal is impossible, because passengers going \\"to Cheyenne\\" want to be confident of arriving at the correct destination!

It governs a set of standards created in January 2006 for address resolution (ARP) and transmitting IPv4 and IPv6 network packets over a Fibre Channel (FC) network. IPFC makes up part of the FC-4 protocol-mapping layer of a Fibre Channel system. In IPFC, each IP datagram packet is wrapped into a FC frame, with its own header, and transmitted as a sequence of one or more frames. The receiver at the other end received the frames, strips the FC headers and reassembles the IP packet. IP datagrams of up to 65,280 bytes in size may be accommodated. ARP packet transmission works in the same fashion. Each IP datagram exchange is unidirectional, although IP and TCP allow for bidirectional communication within their protocols. IPFC is an application protocol that is typically implemented as a device driver in an operating system.

They generally ranged in size from 30 to 140 cm at the shoulder. While Hyaenodon gigas, the largest Hyaenodon species, was as much as 1.4 m high at the shoulder, 10 feet long and weighed about 500 kg, most were in the 5‚Äì15 kg range, equivalent to a mid-sized dog. The anatomy of their skulls show that they had a particularly acute sense of smell, while their teeth were adapted for shearing, rather than crushing. Sinopa grangeri Because of their size range, it is probable that different species hunted in different ways, which allowed them to fill many different predatory niches. Smaller ones would hunt in packs during the night like wolves, and bigger, fiercer ones would hunt alone during the daylight, using their sheer size and their mighty jaws as their principal weapon. The carnassials in a hyaenodontid are generally the second upper and third lower molars. However, some hyaenodontids possessed as many as three sequential pairs of carnassials or carnassial-like molar teeth in their jaws.Wang, Xiaoming; and Tedford, Richard H. Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. p15 Hyaenodontids, like all creodonts, lacked post-carnassial crushing molar teeth, such as those found in many carnivoran families, especially the Canidae and Ursidae, and thus lacked dental versatility for processing any foods other than meat.Wang, Xiaoming; and Tedford, Richard H. Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. p15-7 Hyaenodontids are very unusual in regards to their tooth replacement. Studies on Hyaenodon show that juveniles took 3‚Äì4 years in the last stage of tooth eruption, implying a very long adolescent phase. In North American forms, the first upper premolar erupts before the first upper molar, while European forms show an earlier eruption of the first upper molar. At least one hyaenodontid lineage, Apterodontinae, was specialised for aquatic, otter-like habits. Range Having evolved in Africa during the Paleocene,Gheerbrant E, Iarochene M, Amaghzaz M, Bouya B. Geol Mag. 2006;143:475‚Äì489. hyaenodontids soon after spread into India and Europe, implying close biogeographical connections between these areas.Flor√©al Sol√© & Thierry Smith, Dispersals of placental carnivorous mammals (Carnivoramorpha, Oxyaenodonta & Hyaenodontida) near the Paleocene-Eocene boundary: a climatic and almost worldwide story, GEOLOGICA BELGICA (2013) 16/4: 254-261 Afterwards they dispersed into Asia from either Europe or India, and finally North America.\\"HYAENODONTS AND CARNIVORANS FROM THE EARLY OLIGOCENE TO EARLY MIOCENE XIANSHUIHE FORMATION, LANZHOU BASIN, GANSU PROVINCE, CHINA\\" \\"New Remains of Hyaenodontidae (Creodonta, Mammalia) From the Oligocene of Central Mongolia\\" They were important hypercarnivores in Eurasia, Africa and North America during the Oligocene, but gradually declined, with almost the entire family becoming extinct by the close of the Oligocene. Only four genera, Megistotherium, its sister genera Hyainailouros and Dissopsalis, and the youngest species of Hyaenodon, H. weilini, survived into the Miocene, of which, only Dissopsalis survived long enough to go extinct at the close of the Miocene. Traditionally this has been attributed to competition with carnivorans, but no formal examination of the correlation between the decline of hyaenodontids and the expansion of carnivorans has been reccorded, and the latter may simply have moved into vacant niches after the extinction of hyaenodontid species. Relations Hyaenodontids were historically classified in Creodonta, alongside other predatory mammal groups like oxyaenids. Some researchers consider the clade a wastebasket taxon containing two unrelated clades assumed to be closely related to or ancestral to Carnivora. However, a recent phylogenetic analysis of Paleogene mammals supports the monophyly of Creodonta, and places them in Ferae, close to Pholidota.

Origins and background The true identity of Walstan and details of his life are not known. There are no eye witness accounts of the events surrounding Walstan, who is first recorded in the English historian John Capgrave's Nova Legenda Angli√¶, written in the 15th century. The Domesday Book provides details of Bawburgh where he was born and later buried, without mentioning that its church was important in any way. Walstan's story is described in a manuscript known as the 'Lambeth Life', produced in 1658. A now lost medieval triptych from Bawburgh Church was copied in English on 29 September 1658 by a scribe. Now the 8th item of Lambeth MSS 935 and kept in Lambeth Palace library, it is described by the 17th century scribe as 'The History of St. Walston taken out of an antient parchment MS, enclosed in a case of 3 peices of Wainscott about a yard long each of ym', with a drawing of the case. The triptych was owned a man named Clarke, a Norfolk recusant, who claimed it once came from Bawburgh. Parentage Saint Walstan is associated with the English county of Norfolk. He was born to a wealthy, and perhaps a royal, family. According to the author Tim Pestell, Walstan is supposed to have been born in 975. His father was named Benedict. The anonymous Lambeth Life kept in Lambeth Palace library gives his birthplace as \\"Blyborow town\\" or Blythburgh. Walstan's mother, Saint Blitha of Martham, was a kinswoman of the English king √Üthelred the Unready and his son Edmund Ironside.Blair, John (2002), \\"A Handlist of Anglo-Saxon Saints\\", in Thacker, Alan; Sharpe, Richard, Local Saints and Local Churches in the Early Medieval West, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p515 Following her death and burial at Martham, a chapel was dedicated in her honour. Bequests were made to her for over 400 years.Farmer, David, (2011), The Oxford Dictionary of Saints, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p54 Legend According to the 19th century author Richard Stanton in his volume A Menology of England and Wales, Walstan \\"received a pious education, and was so captivated with the maxims of Christian perfection that, he renounced his inheritance\\". At the age of 12 he left his parents' home, abandoned his wealth, and travelled to Taverham north of Norwich, where he obtained work as a farm labourer. He made a vow of celibacy, but never became a monk. He declined the offer by the farmer he worked for to become his heir, and was instead given a cow which later produced two calves. He died on 30 May 1016 at work in a meadow, after seeing a vision of an angel while at work scything a hay crop. His body was laid on a cart pulled by two white oxen, as he had instructed, and the cortege went to Bawburgh, where he was buried, with the bishop and monks of Norwich in attendance at his funeral. At the three points along the journey that the oxen stopped, a spring arose. By popular demand, Walstan was declared a saint, Legacy and veneration St Mary and St Walstan's, Bawburgh After he was declared a saint, a small chapel was built off the existing church dedicated to Mary, the mother of Jesus, which was given a new dedication of St Mary and St Walstan. He is venerated as a saint of farms and farm workers, but was little known outside his home county. His shrine and the wells associated with him were visited by local farmers and farm laborers throughout the Middle Ages. In 1309 the revenues generated at Bawburgh by pilgrims could provide an income for six priests and the church vicar, in addition to providing the finances needed to rebuild the chancel. At Costessey (), the second place where Walstan's hearse rested, the well there had dried up by 1750; in April 1978 it was recorded as being a deep circular pit about across, with lumps of flint wall at the base, and filled with fallen trees. By January 2015 the depression was still visible, and a plan was proposed to fence off the site of the well and place a plaque there. The well at Bawburgh can still be seen. Saint Walstan is represented in religious art by a crown and sceptre (his generic emblems)‚Äîat least five figures from medieval rood screens depict him in this way‚Äîand with a scythe in his hand and cattle near him (his specific emblems). Churches dedicated to the saint dating from before the English Reformation are found in Norfolk, and a churches in Rongai, Kenya, is dedicated to the saint. His absence from medieval liturgical calendars is thought to be a reflection of the local nature of the cult that appeared after his death. St Walstan's Day is celebrated each year in Bawburgh, when a special Patronal Service takes place on the nearest Sunday to 30 May, his feast date. =Gallery= File:St Mary's church - modern stained glass window - geograph.org.uk - 1400281.jpg St Mary's, Kenninghall, Norfolk File:St Walstan modern depiction.jpgGreat Ryburgh, Norfolk File:St. Walstan's Well, Bawburgh.jpgDetail of the well at Bawburgh File:St Walstan's well in Bawburgh.jpgSt Walstan's well in Bawburgh in its setting File:Catholic church of St Walstan, Costessey.jpgThe Catholic Church of St Walstan, Costessey Notes References Sources   * Further reading  External links * St. Walstan at Catholic Online. * A description of St Mary and St Walstan, Bawburgh from Norfolk Churches * The 'Lambeth Life', St. Walston, and 'Blyborow Town' from Blythburgh.net * 25 inch Ordnance Survey map Norfolk LXII.12 and Norfolk LXII.8, published in 1907, showing the sites of St Walstan's Well at Bawbrugh and Costessey Park.

Prior to 2013, it was commonly cited as having happened about 65 million years ago, but Renne and colleagues (2013) gave an updated value of 66 million years. Evidence indicates that the asteroid fell in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, at Chicxulub, Mexico. The hypothesis is named after the father-and-son team of scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez, who first suggested it in 1980. Shortly afterwards, and independently, the same was suggested by Dutch paleontologist Jan Smit. In March 2010, an international panel of scientists endorsed the asteroid hypothesis, specifically the Chicxulub impact, as being the cause of the extinction. A team of 41 scientists reviewed 20 years of scientific literature and in so doing also ruled out other theories such as massive volcanism. They had determined that a space rock hurtled into earth at Chicxulub. For comparison, the Martian moon Phobos is and Mount Everest is just under . The collision would have released the same energy as , over a billion times the energy of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A 2016 drilling project into the peak ring of the crater strongly supported the hypothesis, and confirmed various matters that had been unclear until that point. These included the fact that the peak ring comprised granite (a rock found deep within the earth) rather than typical sea floor rock, which had been shocked, melted, and ejected to the surface in minutes, and evidence of colossal seawater movement directly afterwards from sand deposits. Crucially, the cores also showed a near complete absence of gypsum, a sulfate- containing rock, which would have been vaporized and dispersed as an aerosol into the atmosphere, confirming the presence of a probable link between the impact and global longer-term effects on the climate and food chain. History In 1980, a team of researchers led by Nobel prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Vaughn Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (K‚ÄìPg boundary, formerly called Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary or K‚ÄìT boundary) contain a concentration of iridium hundreds of times greater than normal. Iridium is extremely rare in the Earth's crust because it is very dense and has the affinity for iron that characterizes the siderophile elements (see Goldschmidt classification), and therefore most of it sank into the Earth's core while the earth was still molten. The Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the earth at the time of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary. Previously, in a 1953 publication, geologists Allan O. Kelly and Frank Dachille analyzed global geological evidence suggesting that one or more giant asteroids impacted the Earth, causing an angular shift in its axis, global floods, fire, atmospheric occlusion, and the extinction of the dinosaurs. There were other earlier speculations on the possibility of an impact event, but without strong confirming evidence. Evidence The evidence for the Alvarez impact hypothesis is supported by chondritic meteorites and asteroids which contain a much higher iridium concentration than the Earth's crust. The isotopic ratio of iridium in meteorites is similar to that of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary layer but significantly different from the ratio in the Earth's crust. Chromium isotopic anomalies found in Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary sediments are similar to that of an asteroid or a comet composed of carbonaceous chondrites. Shocked quartz granules, glass spherules and tektites, indicative of an impact event, are common in the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary, especially in deposits from around the Caribbean. All of these constituents are embedded in a layer of clay, which the Alvarez team interpreted as the debris spread all over the world by the impact. The location of the impact was unknown when the Alvarez team developed their hypothesis, but later scientists discovered the Chicxulub Crater in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, now considered the likely impact site. Badlands near Drumheller, Alberta where erosion has exposed the K‚ÄìPg boundary. Using estimates of the total amount of iridium in the K‚ÄìPg layer, and assuming that the asteroid contained the normal percentage of iridium found in chondrites, the Alvarez team went on to calculate the size of the asteroid. The answer was about 10 kilometers (6 mi) in diameter, about the size of Manhattan. Such a large impact would have had approximately the energy of 100 million megatons, i.e. about 2 million times as great as the most powerful thermonuclear bomb ever tested. Paul Renne of the Berkeley Geochronology Center has reported that the date of the asteroid event is 66,038,000 years ago, plus or minus 11,000 years, based on Ar-Ar dating. He further posits that the mass extinction of dinosaurs occurred within 33,000 years of this date. In April 2019 a paper was published in PNAS which describes evidence from a fossil site in North Dakota that the authors say provides a \\"postimpact snapshot\\" of events after the asteroid collision \\"including ejecta accretion and faunal mass death\\". The team found that the tektites that had peppered the area were present in amber found on the site and were also embedded in the gills of about 50 percent of the fossil fish. They were also able to find traces of iridium. The authors ‚Äì who include Walter Alvarez ‚Äì postulate that shock of the impact, equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 10 or 11, may have led to seiches, oscillating movements of water in lakes, bays, or gulfs, that would have reached the site in North Dakota within minutes or hours of the impact. This would have led to the rapid burial of organisms under a thick layer of sediment. Coauthor David Burnham of the University of Kansas was quoted as saying ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not crushed, it‚Äôs like an avalanche that collapses almost like a liquid, then sets like concrete. They were killed pretty suddenly because of the violence of that water. We have one fish that hit a tree and was broken in half.‚Äù Impact The most easily observable consequence of such an impact would be a vast dust cloud which would block sunlight and prevent photosynthesis for a few years, an event called an impact winter. This would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton and of all organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). But small creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival. It is estimated that sulfuric acid aerosols were injected into the stratosphere, leading to a 10‚Äì20% reduction of solar transmission normal for that period. It would have taken at least ten years for those aerosols to dissipate. Global firestorms may have resulted as incendiary fragments from the blast fell back to Earth. Analyses of fluid inclusions in ancient amber suggest that the oxygen content of the atmosphere was very high (30‚Äì35%) during the late Cretaceous. This high O2 level would have supported intense combustion. The level of atmospheric O2 plummeted in the early Paleogene Period. If widespread fires occurred, they would have increased the CO2 content of the atmosphere and caused a temporary greenhouse effect once the dust cloud settled, and this would have exterminated the most vulnerable survivors of the \\"long winter\\". The impact may also have produced acid rain, depending on what type of rock the asteroid struck. However, recent research suggests this effect was relatively minor. Chemical buffers would have limited the changes, and the survival of animals vulnerable to acid rain effects (such as frogs) indicate this was not a major contributor to extinction. Impact hypotheses can only explain very rapid extinctions, since the dust clouds and possible sulphuric aerosols would wash out of the atmosphere in a fairly short time ‚Äì possibly under ten years. Although further studies of the K‚ÄìPg layer consistently show the excess of iridium, the idea that the dinosaurs were exterminated by an asteroid remained a matter of controversy among geologists and paleontologists for more than a decade. Criticism Amongst others, Charles B. Officer and Gerta Keller have been critical of the theory. Officer and Jake Page describe in their The Great Dinosaur Extinction ControversyBlake & Officer (1996). The Great Dinosaur Extinction Controversy (Addison-Wesley), how * A dust cloud from an asteroid impact could not have existed because many marine plants that require uninterrupted sunlight were unaffected * The iridium deposits appear to be the work of volcanoes * The extinctions occurred gradually, not instantaneously \\"Even if a meteoric impact occurred at K-T time, it simply could not explain the extinction record.\\" * The Chicxulub structure is a volcanic sequence of late Cretaceous age; it is not an impact meltsheet of Cretaceous-Tertiary age * Papers disputing the Alvarez hypothesis were summarily rejected by journals without review Keller has focussed on Deccan Traps volcanism as a likely cause of a more gradual extinction. 2016 Chicxulub crater drilling project In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the Chicxulub impact crater, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact, and its effects. They confirmed that the rock composing the peak ring had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by immense heat and shocked by immense pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, it originates much deeper in the earth and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact; that gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and must therefore have been almost entirely vaporized and entered the atmosphere, and that the event was immediately followed by a huge megatsunami (a massive movement of sea waters) sufficient to lay down the largest known layer of sand separated by grain size directly above the peak ring. These strongly support the hypothesis that the impactor was large enough to create a 120-mile peak ring, to melt, shock and eject basement granite from the midcrust deep within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted for a long time. This global dispersal of dust and sulfates would have led to a sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature drops, and devastated the food chain.

Vises have two parallel jaws, one fixed and the other movable, threaded in and out by a screw and lever. Light duty homeowner's vise holding a brass check valve Types =Woodworking= Woodworker's vise with entirely wooden jaws Woodworking vises are attached to a workbench, typically flush with its work surface. Their jaws are made of wood or metal, the latter usually faced with wood, called cheeks, to avoid marring the work. The movable jaw may include a retractable dog to hold work against a bench dog. \\"Quick-release\\" vises employ a split nut that allows the screw to engage or disengage with a half-turn of the handle. When disengaged the movable jaw may be moved in or out throughout its entire range of motion, vastly speeding up the process of adjustment. Common thread types are Acme and buttress. Traditional workbench vises are commonly either face vises, attached to the front of the workbench, near the left end (for a right-handed worker) or end vises, attached to or forming part of the right end of the bench. One common variety of face vise is the leg vise, which has a long extension down to the floor, with a provision to adjust the spacing of the bottom of the leg, to keep the clamping surfaces of the jaws approximately parallel, even though the work to be clamped may be of various thicknesses. =Engineer's= Engineer's bench vise made of cast iron - image inset shows soft jaws A small machine vise used in a drill press A machine vise that can be rotated An engineer's vise, also known as a metalworking vise or machinist's vise, is used to clamp metal instead of wood. It is used to hold metal when filing or cutting. It is sometimes made of cast steel or malleable cast iron, but most are made of cast iron. However, most heavy duty vises are 55,000 psi cast steel or 65,000 psi ductile iron. Some vises have a cast iron body but a steel channel bar. Cast iron is popular because it is typically 30,000 psi grey iron which is rigid, strong and inexpensive. The jaws are often separate and replaceable, usually engraved with serrated or diamond teeth. Soft jaw covers made of aluminum, copper, wood (for woodworking) or plastic may be used to protect delicate work. The jaw opening of an engineer's vise is almost always the same size as the jaw width, if not bigger. An engineer's vise is bolted onto the top surface of a workbench, with the face of the fixed jaws just forward of its front edge. The vise may include other features such as a small anvil on the back of its body. Most engineer's vises have a swivel base. Some engineer's vises marketed as \\"Homeowner Grade\\" are not made of steel or cast iron, but of pot metal or a very low grade of iron, typically with a tensile strength of under 10 ksi. Most homeowner's bench vises have an exposed screw. Aluminum soft jaw shown holding five parts at a time in a CNC milling machine. =Machine= Machine vises are mounted on drill presses, grinding machines and milling machines. Abrasive chop saws have a special type of machine vise built into the saw. Some hobbyists use a machine vise as a bench vise because of the low cost and small size. =Vacuum= A miniature vise for model assembly with a suction cup base A vacuum vise is a hobbyist's tool, commonly used to hold circuit boards, model airplanes and other small work. They are mounted with a suction cup and often have an articulated joint in the middle to allow the vise to pivot and swivel. Jewelers also use vacuum vises to hold jewelry. =Pipe= Pipe vises are a plumber's tool, often used to hold pipes in place for threading and cutting. There are two main styles: chain and yoke. The yoke type vise uses a screw to clamp down the pipe, and the chain style uses a chain for securing the pipe. Heavy duty metalworking vise showing some cosmetic distress and a missing mounting bolt =Clamp-on= Clamp-on vises are basically very light-duty bench vises. They usually have smooth jaws for wood, plastic and light metalworking, but some have serrated jaws for getting a better grip on metal. Some unique vises combine these features in a rotating design. They also help to secure an object while working on the object. =Combination= Vises that combine the functions of a pipe vise with a metalworker's vise do exist, and are quite common. Some vises have a rotating design to provide both bench and pipe jaws. These are often used by plumbers. =Others= Soviet hand vices. Other kinds of vise include: * Hand vises * Compound slide vises are more complex machine vises. They allow speed and precision in the placement of the work. * Cross vises, which can be adjusted using leadscrews in the X and Y axes; these are useful if many holes need to be drilled in the same workpiece using a drill press. Compare router table. * Off-center vises * Angle vises * Sine vises, which use gauge blocks to set up a highly accurate angle * Rotary vises * Suction vices * Diemakers' vise * Saw vices ‚Äì used for sharpening hand saws * Pin vises (for holding thin, long cylindrical objects by one end, or used as a drill (scale modeler's pin vise)) * Jewellers' vises and by contrast * Fly tying vise, used to secure fishing hook in fly tying * Leg vises, which are attached to a bench but also supported from the ground so as to be stable under the very heavy use imposed by a blacksmith's work * Trailer hitch vice * Shaker broom vise * Rigging vise, otherwise known as a triangle vise or splicing vise, which has three jaws. Used to close thimbles and splice rope, cable, and wire rope. =Misuse= A vise is sometimes misused as a makeshift press. Sometimes people will extend the handle with a cheater bar or hit it with a hammer. This typically will void the warranty of the vise and possibly damage it. This type of misuse is frequently covered in the instruction manuals for vises.http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/pdfImages/85/85db41ac-3902-450b-b875-d0a1ebff68a9.pdf Another way to misuse a vise is by pulling back too strongly against the movable face.http://www.reliableplant.com/Read/1625/tool-misuse See also *Parallels *Vise grip References =Notes= =Citations= Category:Metalworking hand tools Category:Woodworking clamps ","title":"Vise"},{"id":"2536215","text":"The Politics of Andhra Pradesh take place in the context of a bicameral parliamentary system within the Constitutional framework of India. The main parties in the state are the YSR Congress party, Telugu Desam Party and Jana Sena Party. Other parties that have small presence in the state include the Indian National Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party. Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is the incumbent Chief Minister. Formation of Andhra Pradesh In December 1953, the States Reorganisation Commission was appointed to prepare for the creation of states on linguistic lines. Thus, merging the Telugu-speaking region of Hyderabad State (Telangana) with Telugu-speaking state of Andhra state, the Central Government, established a unified Andhra Pradesh on 1 November 1956.  Congress era  The Indian National Congress party won all the state elections from the emergence of the state on 1 October 1953 till 1983. Projects like Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam Dams were constructed during this time. There were ten different Chief Ministers from the formation of the state in 1956 till 1983. Telangana movement Marri Chenna Reddy formed the Telangana Praja Samiti party to lead the Telangana movement. In November 1969, there was a major split in the party which eventually led to the downfall of the movement. He resigned his position to make room for a leader from Telangana to become the Chief Minister. On 30 September 1971, P. V. Narasimha Rao became the Chief Minister.  Emergence of Telugu Desam Party  In 1983, N. T. Rama Rao (NTR), a popular Telugu actor, established his Telugu Desam Party (Telugu Desam, meaning Land of Telugus) with the support of people's dissent arising out of frequent changes in chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He ran on a platform of \\"Telugu Pride\\". Within nine months of its founding, Telugu Desam was voted to power and NTR became the first \\"Non-Congress\\" Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. Nadendla Bhaskara Rao broke with the party and formed a state government with the help of the opposition Congress(I). However his government lasted only 31 days as he did not command a majority in the Assembly. NTR was reinstated to power on 16 September 1984.  Return of the Congress  The Congress returned to power when Marri Chenna Reddy was sworn in for his second term as Chief Minister on 3 December 1989.The Congress lasted in power until the elections of 1994.  NTR's second term  In the elections of 1994, N. T. Rama Rao's Telugu Desam Party ran advocating prohibition of alcohol in response to a women's movement. He had then recently married his second wife Lakshmi Parvathi. NTR's campaign focused on the rural areas which won him a significant majority in the state elections of 1995.  Second breakup of the Telugu Desam  When NTR became the Chief Minister in 1994, he appointed one of his sons-in-law Nara Chandrababu Naidu as the Revenue Minister. Soon after the formation of the government, Naidu took the MLAs of NTR Cabinet in Viceroy Hotel, Hyderabad and convinced them to support him in order to save the TDP. NTR was dethroned and the TDP's leadership passed on to Chandrababu Naidu faction. The new TDP(NTR) party was formed by Lakshmi Parvati after NTR's death on 18 January 1996 in order to challenge Naidu's TDP. Chandrababu Naidu's TDP won the next elections with help of BJP.  2004 Assembly Elections  Under Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy (\\"YSR\\"), the Indian National Congress party won the 2004 elections as part of a coalition with TRS. During the run-up to the 2004 elections, Y.S Rajasekhara Reddy was able to bring a common platform and mutual agreement within the Andhra Pradesh unit of the Congress. His campaign took form of a three-month- long \\"padhayatra\\" or journey on foot. The elections resulted in the defeat of the then-ruling Telugu Desam Party under the leadership of Chandrababu Naidu. The Congress also won the municipal elections in 2005, district local body elections in 2006, and Panchayat Elections in 2006.  2009 Assembly Elections  In the 2009 Andhra Pradesh general election the Indian National Congress under the leadership of YSR won a simple majority by winning 156 of 294 assembly seats. Telugu Desam Party gained a few more assembly seats than the previous election. Praja Rajyam Party founded by Chiranjeevi won 16% of the votes. The TRS and the Left parties in combination won less than 7% of the votes. Lok Satta Party won its first Assembly seat and captured more than 1% vote share. As Rajasekhara Reddy died on 2 September 2009 in a helicopter crash, K. Rosaiah of the Indian National Congress took charge as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. However Rosaiah resigned as Chief Minister on health grounds. The next day, on 25 November 2010, Chief Minister Nallari Kiran Kumar Reddy of Indian National Congress took charges as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.  2014 Formation of Telangana state  Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao(KCR) started Telangana Rashtra Samithi(TRS) party in 2001 to lead the second phase of the Telangana movement which reached its peak during the period 2009‚Äì2014. This resulted in carving of the Telangana state on 2 June 2014. There was unsuccessful counter agitation in Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra regions to stop the statehood.  2014 Assembly Elections  On 2 June 2014 the aftermath of 14th Assembly general election, Telugu Desam Party won 104 seats out of 175 Seats. Telugu Actor turned politician Pawan Kalyan supported BJP-TDP coalition and N. Chandrababu Naidu became the first Chief Minister of bifurcated Andhra Pradesh defeating YS Jagan Mohan Reddy of YSR Congress Party. 2019 Assembly Elections In the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, the Telugu Desam Party contested alone, without any alliance. The Indian National Congress was earlier split into the INC and YSR Congress Party led by Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy. JSP led by Pawan Kalyan also participated with an alliance with the CPI, CPM and the Bahujan Samaj Party. The TDP won only 23 seats while the YSR Congress Party swept the elections with a majority and 151 seats. Its leader Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy became the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh on 30 May 2019. Jana Sena Party won only 1 seat with 7% vote share in the state.

Chimfunshi started as a family-run wildlife orphanage, and today Chimfunshi is managed by a board of trustees to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sanctuary. Chimfunshi was founded in 1983 when a game ranger brought a badly wounded infant chimpanzee to the cattle ranch of David and Sheila Siddle. The Siddles nursed that chimp ‚Äì named \\"Pan\\" ‚Äì back to health, thereby establishing a tradition of care and respect that forms the legacy of the sanctuary. Once word of Pan‚Äôs recovery spread, the Siddles were inundated with orphaned chimpanzees. Although many of the chimpanzees were confiscated from poachers who attempted to smuggle the infants into Zambia for sale as pets, an equally large number were rescued from dilapidated zoos and circuses from all over Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. With 120 chimpanzees, Chimfunshi is now one of the largest chimpanzee sanctuaries in the world. The orphanage is home to other rescued animals such as baboons, vervet monkeys, parrots, antelopes, owls, buzzards, sheep, and peacocks. Chimfunshi is recognized as an ‚ÄúImportant Bird Area‚Äù (IBA #22), an area recognized as being a globally important habitat for the conservation of bird populations. Chimfunshi is one of about 10,000 IBAs worldwide. Some of the species that can be found at Chimfunshi are: pale- billed hornbill, coppery tailed coucal, Miombo Scrub robin, red-capped Crombec, white-headed black chat, chestnut-backed Sparrow-Weaver, and broad- tailed Paradise-Whydah. An old chimpanzee at Chimfunshi Located 65 km west of Chingola on the banks of the Kafue River, the orphanage is a tourist attraction for those living in the Copperbelt towns and for international visitors to Zambia. Chimpanzees are not found in the wild in Zambia, the nearest populations are about 500 km north of Chimfunshi, but wildlife smuggling routes out of the Congo pass through Zambia. The sanctuary is a member of the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance. In 2002, Sheila Siddle published her autobiography, In My Family Tree: A Life With Chimpanzees, to widespread acclaim. The Siddles were awarded the Jane Goodall Award for establishing Chimfunshi. Research Chimfunshi has evolved into a major centre for education and research. The sanctuary offers the unique opportunity to observe the complex social behaviour of chimpanzees in their almost natural habitat and in large social groups. It also allows a number of social and educational projects in the field and a chance to get to know the people and culture of Zambia. Animal welfare and research thus complement each other perfectly: primate researchers from around the world come to Chimfunshi to investigate the chimpanzees‚Äô social behavior, communication and cognition. Scientists conduct observational studies while learning about the daily lives of people in an African country. In addition to observations of the chimpanzees that teach some students the methods of behavioural research, field trips are offered to investigate the unique flora and fauna of Zambia. The Education Center at Chimfunshi not only attracts international primate researchers but also students from America and Europe, as well as school classes and their teachers from Zambia. Chimfunshi works closely and regularly with scientists from the Max Planck Institutes for Evolutionary Anthropology (Leipzig, Germany), and for Psycholinguistics (Nijmegen, Netherlands), the Free University of Berlin, and Gonzaga University's fh in the U.S. Volunteering Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage and their partner, African Impact, offer a volunteer program for supporters. Volunteers help care for chimpanzees through behavioural enrichment activities, infrastructure development and community farming initiatives.

They are a well- known landmark on the eastern edge of the plateau that includes the Dolly Sods Wilderness. They sit in a high-elevation heathland punctuated with wind-carved sandstone outcrops and is home to more than a dozen rare plant and animal species. Situated on the crest of the Allegheny Front, Bear Rocks afford vistas over the South Branch Potomac River. Visibility can extend eastward to the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. The Bear Rocks Preserve is a tract that is owned and preserved by The Nature Conservancy. Location Bear Rocks consists of a group of rock outcroppings on the Allegheny Front, an escarpment that in this area provides about two thousand feet of vertical relief and forms the Eastern Continental Divide. To the east, looking out over the South Branch of the Potomac River, which drains into the Atlantic Ocean via the Chesapeake Bay, there are breathtaking views where seven mountain ridges are visible on a clear day extending into Virginia. On the clearest days you can see Hawksbill Mountain and Stony Man, the highest peaks in Shenandoah National Park. To the west, water drains into Dolly Sods towards Red Creek, which eventually flows to the Gulf of Mexico via the Dry Fork River, Black Fork, Cheat, Mongahela, Ohio and Mississippi River. Farther north along the ridge of the Front are two more salients, Stack Rocks and Haystack Rocks. Climate Bear Rocks is known for its cool climate, alpine appearance and northern wildlife. Strong prevailing winds bring clouds from the west. While rising to clear the ridge of the Allegheny Front they cool, causing mist and rain totaling more than per year. During the winter of 2003, of snow fell in the area, although is more typical. The trees and shrubs become broken downward and gnarled along the ridge from the drying winds, the chilling rime frost and the heavy ice glazing and snow. Along the rim are stunted red spruce trees with flag-formed limbs pointing to the east - a result of the almost constant and often high-velocity winds. Ecology One-quarter to one-half (400 to 800 m) a mile below the ridge lies a moist forest of red spruce and hemlock, with a floor blanketed in ferns, mountain laurel and rhododendron thickets. But on the broad ridge top where the climate is the most severe, the lush vegetation gives way to stunted, scattered trees, open heath land, and tundra plants left over from the ice ages. Many of the plants and animals here are typically found in the North, such as snowshoe hare, saw-whet owls, boreal red-backed voles, and fisher. It is also a prime raptor and warbler-watching site during autumn migration and a popular berry-picking spot in midsummer. The area around Bear Rocks supports subalpine heathlands dominated by shrubs such as blueberries, huckleberries, mountain laurel, azalea, and rhododendron. Groves of stunted red spruce, flagged by ice and wind, outcrops of the Pottsville conglomerate, grassy meadows, and cranberry bogs also occur. There are stunted small groves of red spruce trying to make a tortured comeback here and there in the wind and coldheath barrens of huckleberries, blueberries, mountain laurel, mountain holly, speckled alder and other waist-high plants. In several places the heath barrens, also called \\"huckleberry plains\\" or \\"roaring plains\\", give way to natural balds of mountain oat grass that predate the devastation wrought by logging and fires during the late 19th century. Geology Large, striking and uniquely shaped white sandstone and quartz rocks are found throughout the Bear Rocks Preserve area. Erosion has carved bowl-shaped cavities in many of these wind- and rain-sculpted sandstone boulders and these cavities are often filled with water (or ice) and algae. In addition to the sculpted boulders are \\"rock streams\\" formed during glacial periods. The freeze-thaw cycles heaved and split rock, creating rock streams up to wide and hundreds of feet long. Other rock patterns include polygons and circles. Other information Informal trails weave across the Bear Rocks Preserve. An extensive trail system occurs on the adjacent national forest lands, including the Dolly Sods Wilderness. Bear Rocks' natural heathlands and open grass balds were originally recorded in 1746 by a survey party that included Peter Jefferson, father of Thomas Jefferson.

Floriade comes from the Latin word , which means to design with flowers. The festival attracts tourists from around Australia and overseas in spring from mid September to mid October each year, and is considered the most important regular event for tourism in the Australian Capital Territory. It is also called \\"Australia's Celebration of Spring\\". After some controversy regarding an entry charge, admission to Floriade has been free for a number of years.  History  Floriade was the idea of Christiaan Slotemaker de Bruine, Landscape Architect with the Department of Capital Territory in Canberra. He commenced the design in 1986 and based it on the world famous 'Keukenhof' garden in The Netherlands. He orchestrated the construction with Peter Sutton, Holticulturist and Manager of Commonwealth Garden. He arranged the marketing, sculptures, live music, the purchase of bulbs, entertainment, lifting of bulb quarantine quotas as well as the design. Together with Peter Sutton, they build the design on the Site of Commonwealth Park with the help of City Parks staff. The design concept was 'multiculturalism of the Nation' and included Dutch and Aboriginal floral layouts. Chris obtained sponsorship from the Embassy of the Netherlands and the Bicentennial Authority. Peter and Chris continued their successful partnership during the next two years, 1989 and 1990. Floriade started in 1988 as a one off celebration of Canberra's 75th birthday and Australia's Bicentenary of European settlement. Due to the success and popularity of the event it has ran with a new theme every year, and is the largest flower festival in the Southern Hemisphere, with over 300,000 visitors each year. In September 2005 ACT tourism authorities considered legal action over a trademark violation with Hunter Valley Gardens in New South Wales, who had renamed their annual floral festival to Floriade Hunter Valley Gardens. The term Floriade was replaced with Festival of Flowers in 2006. in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic the one million bulbs and annuals that would typically beautify Commonwealth Park were rearranged over 130 sites to create a Tulip Trail through Canberra's suburbs and city for Floriade: Reimagined. Around 300,000 of the million bulbs and annuals were distributed to community groups and organisations, with not-for-profits, sporting clubs, schools and early learning centres as well as residents‚Äô groups across Canberra. Floriade in 2005 Public art and culture Floriade gives expression to public art, each year commissioning works which are placed in the Floriade gardens. Some remain beyond the festival. Floriade also showcases musical displays with many live performances, cultural celebrations, artistic displays, entertainment and recreational activities. Floriade has also held a gnome decorating competition and display for several years, with strong participation from schools, aged people's homes, and businesses. Since 2005 the Floriade Gnome Gnoll has been managed by the Rotary Club of Canberra East, with proceeds going to local and overseas activities. The 2005 theme of Rock 'n Roll only accentuated the regular theme of decorating gnomes as the members of bands. Examples shown below are the Australian children's entertainers, The Wiggles, in this case renamed The Gniggles, and the crowd favourite, KISS submitted by Weetangera Primary School.

For many young people, holding a working holiday visa enables them to experience living in a foreign country without undergoing the usual costly expenses of finding work sponsorship in advance or going on expensive university exchange programmes. Most working holiday visas are offered under reciprocal agreements between certain countries to encourage travel and cultural exchange between their citizens. There are often several restrictions on this type of visa: * Many are intended for young travellers and, as such, have an age restriction (usually from 18 to 30 or 35). * There are usually limits on the type of employment taken or the length of time the traveller can be employed. * The visa holder is expected to have sufficient funds to live on while employment is sought. * The visa holder should have some kind of health or travel insurance for the duration of the stay unless the country will cover.

The defendant subject to the adjournment in contemplation of dismissal is restored to the status he or she occupied prior to arrest, either during or after the period of adjournment that accompanies the ACD: that is, all records of the arrest and after the period for which the ACD applies; however, in many jurisdictions a local law enforcement record of the arrest is retained by default, unless that record is explicitly expunged. The judge adjourning in contemplation of dismissal may impose specific conditions on the defendant subject to the ACD, which may include community service, drug rehabilitation, making restitution with a victim of the circumstances, avoiding contact with the victim, or completing some other diversion program. It may also be accompanied by an admonition to abstain from wanton, injurious, criminal, abusive or disruptive behavior. On the acceptance of the ACD and its without disposition and the defendant is released without bail condition.  Application and surrounding process  The burden of proof in the court systems which employ the system of ACD rests with the people (that is, the prosecution). If evidence demonstrating guilt is not presented, the matter is deemed dismissed, and the ACD proceeds along its standard course of action. United States In United States criminal law, adjournment in contemplation of dismissal may be offered to a defendant in the interest of justice with a view toward ultimate dismissal of the charge.See e.g. New York Criminal Procedure Law, Section 170.55 When available, and granted to a defendant, the judge normally adjourns the case for a period time, often in the range of six months to a year, after which time the case will be dismissed as long as the defendant has stayed out of trouble (i.e., has not been arrested again). In most jurisdictions an ACOD is not classified as a form of probation, and if successfully completed the defendant does not receive a conviction. Adjournment in contemplation of dismissal may be called by different names in other states. In Maryland, it is termed probation before judgment. In Alabama a similar procedure is called pre-trial diversion or deferred prosecution. In New Jersey, it is called a \\"conditional discharge\\". =New York= In New York State, a case subject to an ACD is normally dismissed and sealed on the date of adjournment, except on objection from the prosecution. There is a separate provision for ACDs involving marijuana in the state of New York, under CPL 170.56.Full legislation on Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal in Cases Involving Marihuana.

It enrolls about four hundred students, age fourteen and older, who participate in orchestra and other large ensembles, an opera program, play chamber music, study composition, and take private lessons. A faculty of sixty is drawn from orchestras, conservatories, and universities. The season runs from the last week of June through the first week of August. Four performance venues, including the 1800-seat Whittington- Pfohl Auditorium, host more than eighty public concerts that attract audiences of some 50,000 persons. The Music Center, as it is known colloquially, also partners with the Transylvania County Library for a number of free public events. With an annual budget of more than three million dollars, the Center contributes substantially to the economy of western North Carolina. The Brevard Music Center began life in 1936 as a summer music camp for boys at Davidson College. The founder, Davidson faculty member James Christian Pfohl, led the program for seven years at Davidson and one season at Queens College in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1944 Pfohl moved the program to its present location in Brevard, North Carolina, and he instituted a festival of concerts in 1945. The name \\"Brevard Music Center\\" was adopted in 1955. Pfohl remained artistic director until 1964, when he was succeeded by Henry Janiec of Converse College, for whom the opera program is named. Janiec was succeeded in 1997 by conductor David Effron. Keith Lockhart became the Artistic Director in October 2007. The Brevard Music Center offers instruction in orchestral instruments, piano, composition, voice, and opera. Brevard Music Center has traditionally focused on all periods of classical music, but in recent years, it has branched out to include bluegrass and more contemporary selections.

History John Prestwich, an engineer, commenced manufacture of scientific instruments in 1895, when he was 20, initially behind his father's house at 1 Lansdowne Road, Tottenham, London. By 1911 he had moved to new premises in Tariff Road, within the Northumberland Park area of Tottenham, London, and which still exists as of 2015. Prestwich was initially best known for his cinematography cameras and projectors. He worked with S.Z. de Ferranti and later the cinema pioneer William Friese-Greene. Circa 1902 J.A.Prestwich and Company began manufacturing motorcycle engines which were used in many motorcycle marques. The motorcycle engines were associated with racing and record success and were used in speedway bikes into the 1960s. Prestwich also made engines for aeroplanes. In 1919 Prestwich formed Pencils Limited to exploit his invention of new machinery and the company made Master Pencils, also in Tariff Road. In the nineteen thirties engine production increasingly focused on small industrial and agricultural engines. During WWII Prestwich produced around 240,000 industrial petrol engines in support of the war effort, together with millions of aircraft parts, fuses, etc. In 1951 the assets of J.A.Prestwich and Company Limited and Pencils Ltd were taken over by J.A.Prestwich Industries Limited which was registered on 23 April 1951 and floated on the London Stock Exchange shortly after. By 1957 practically all the shares in the company had been acquired by Villiers Engineering Company Limited of Wolverhampton, which also made motorcycle and industrial engines. The engineering works in Northumberland Park closed in 1963 and J.A.Prestwich Industries Limited was liquidated in 1964. Papers, photographs and publicity material relating to the company are held at the Bruce Castle Museum, Tottenham and the Science Museum Library & Archives at the Science Museum at Wroughton. Products =Motorcycles= From 1904 to 1908 complete motorcycles were produced from the development of the first overhead valve motorcycle engine to be produced in the UK. After that the factory concentrated on supplying its engines to other manufacturers, including Brough Superior, Triumph Motorcycles, A. J. Stevens & Co. Ltd, Enfield Cycle Co, Hazlewoods Limited, Zenith Motorcycles, and HRD Motorcycles, the forerunner of Vincent Motorcycles. Machines that incorporated its engines included the AJS Model D, fabricated for the Russians in the First World War. JAP exported significant numbers of engines to foreign motorcycle manufacturers including Dresch and Terrot in France, and Ardie, Hecker and Tornax in Germany. Latterly, JAP engines (under Villiers control) were used in motorcycle racing, and most commonly speedway or dirt track. Various enthusiasts continued development of the engine into the 70's primarily for grass track, speedway and long track use. Variants included the use of 4 valve heads, twin spark plugs and early electronic ignition systems. Some were modified to run as alcohol fuelled engines primarily for speedway use. All the engines were 4 stroke. Use of the engine declined in the 70's as competing engines from Jawa- CZ and GM were developed giving better performance. {  National Motor Museum Monorail in Beaulieu 1950 Rotrax JAP Speedway, National Motor Museum Monorail in Beaulieu 1948 J.A.P. Speedway Racer, California Automobile Museum } =Aircraft engines= Early aircraft were light and basic, and needed a reliable lightweight engine for power. JAP motorcycle engines were often used in this application. A JAP engine was originally fitted in A V Roe's 1909 triplane, regarded as the first all-British aircraft, and for a while Prestwich and Roe had a partnership. JA Prestwich at first would deliver the same engine to the aircraft manufacturer, allowing them to make local modifications ‚Äì mainly larger venturi tubes for the carburettor, to allow for greater air intake at altitude. In the late 1920s and early 1930s JA Prestwich produced various heavier engines under licence, including those for the UK market for Aeronca. =Motorcar engines= 1934 Morgan Super Sport with JAP engine JAP engines were extensively used in cyclecars in the 1910 to 1914 period when they were popular with small manufacturers. In 1914 JAP announced a new engine made specifically for the cyclecar: a V-twin of 90mm bore and 85mm stroke (1082cc). The engine had a larger flywheel than the motorcycle engine and an enclosed magneto drive. The engine was illustrated fitted to a Morgan three-wheeler.\\"J.A.P. Engines for 1915\\", The Motor Cycle magazine, 22 Oct 1914, p461 In light of JAP's development of high-powered light engines for speedway, some low volume pre-war car manufacturers, including G.N., T.B., Morgan Motor Company and Reliant, used JAP engines to power their vehicles. This use of the JAP extended into motor racing after WWII. Most were used in specialist UK lightweight formulas, or more extensively in Formula 3 racing after developments by John Cooper. In its later life, JA Prestwich produced components for other vehicle manufacturers, including the cylinder head for the Lotus Cortina and the early versions of the Ford-based Lotus Elan engine. =Film production and projection= Cinematographic equipment including cameras, printers, mutoscopes, cutting and perforating machines, and projectors, such as the Bioscope projectors for the Warwick Trading Company and Charles Urban, were produced by the company in the early part of the 20th century. = Railway trolleys = Early models of the railway maintenance ganger's Wickham trolley, from 1948, used a vee-twin JAP engine. This drove through a large flat flywheel and a friction drive. In the 1950s other Wickham trolleys used the 600 cc JAP engine and drove through a clutch, tail shaft and bevel drive. =Utility engines= J.A. Prestwich also made small utility engines under the JAP name for a variety of uses, both stationary and in motorised equipment. They ranged in size from the smallest model 0 two-stroke engine to the much larger type 6 engine, and were used on rotovators, generating sets, milking sets, water pumps, lawnmowers, hay elevators and other agricultural machines. Most were 4-stroke, but there were some 2-stroke engines such as the model 0; they were quite reliable, and examples can still be seen at vintage rallies around Britain. While most of the engines bore the JAP name, some, such as the model 3 OHV engine made for Arthur Lyon & Co for their ALCO generator sets, had timing covers with the name ALCO Featherlight cast in. J.A.P. also had a factory in Chelmsford Road, Southgate, London, employing 40 to 50 people, where these engines were being made in 1955.

Asclepius passed by Earth on 22 March 1989 at a distance of . Although this exceeds the Moon's orbital radius, the close pass received attention at that time. \\"On the cosmic scale of things, that was a close call\\", said Dr. Henry Holt. Geophysicists estimate that collision with Asclepius would release energy comparable to the explosion of a 600 megaton atomic bomb. The asteroid was discovered 31 March 1989, nine days after its closest approach to the Earth. Subsequent discoveries revealed that a whole class of such objects exists. Close approaches by objects the size of Asclepius pass by every two or three years, undetected until the start of computerized near-Earth object searches. On 24 March 2051, the asteroid will pass from the Earth. It will be the eighth pass of less than 30 Gm in this century. JPL shows that the uncertainty region of the asteroid will cause it to most likely pass from 0.02 AU to 0.17 AU from the Earth in 2135.

Abba Isaac, Isaac Syrus and Isaac of Qatar, was a 7th-century Church of the East Syriac Christian bishop and theologian best remembered for his written works on Christian asceticism. He is regarded as a saint in the Assyrian Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox tradition. His feast day falls, together with 4th-century theologian and hymnographer St. Ephrem the Syrian, on January 28. Life He was born in the region of Beth Qatraye in Eastern Arabia, a mixed Syriac and Arabic speaking region encompassing the south east of Mesopotamia and the north eastern Arabian peninsula. When still quite young, he entered a monastery where he devoted his energies towards the practice of asceticism. After many years of studying at the library attached to the monastery, he emerged as an authoritative figure in theology. Shortly after, he dedicated his life to monasticism and became involved in religious education throughout the Beth Qatraye region. When the Catholicos Georges (680‚Äì659) visited Beth Qatraye in the middle of the seventh century to attend a synod, he ordained Isaac bishop of Nineveh far to the north in Assyria. The administrative duties did not suit his retiring and ascetic bent: he requested to abdicate after only five months, and went south to the wilderness of Mount Matout, a refuge for anchorites. There he lived in solitude for many years, eating only three loaves a week with some uncooked vegetables, a detail that never failed to astonish his hagiographers. Eventually blindness and old age forced him to retire to the Assyrian monastery of Rabban Shabur in Mesopotamia, where he died and was buried. At the time of his death he was nearly blind, a fact that some attribute to his devotion to study. Legacy Isaac is remembered for his spiritual homilies on the inner life, which have a human breadth and theological depth that transcends the Christianity of the Church to which he belonged. They survive in Syriac manuscripts and in later Greek, Arabic, and Georgian translations. From Greek they were translated into Russian. Isaac consciously avoided writing on topics that were disputed or discussed in the contemporary theological debates. This gives Isaac a certain ecumenical potential, and is probably the reason that he has come to be venerated and appreciated among many different Christian traditions. Isaac stands in the tradition of the eastern mystical saints and placed a considerable emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit. His melancholic style as well as his affinity towards the sick and dying exerted considerable influence on Eastern Orthodoxy. His writings were continuously studied by monastery circles outside his church during the 8th and 9th century. Moreover, Isaac's conviction that the notion of God punishing men endlessly through the mystery of Gehenna (the lake of fire, or hell) is not compatible with his all encompassing love can likely be seen as the central thematic conflict in his second treatise of mystical teachings.Brock, S., trans. (1997). The Wisdom of Saint Isaac the Syrian. pp. 5-9. Fairacres Oxford, England: SLG Press, Convent of the Incarnation. . Isaac's writings offer a rare example of a large corpus of ascetical texts written by an experienced hermit and is thus an important writer when it comes to understanding early Christian asceticism.Hagman, Patrik: The Asceticism of Isaac of Nineveh (Oxford University Press 2010) Writings The instructions of Isaac the Syrian came to us in several books. The First book contains 82 chapters while the Second contains 41. There is also a Third book which has been translated into Italian and English. Here are some examples: * Faith, God‚Äôs providence, prayer To whatever extent a person draws close to God with his intentions, is to what extent God draws close to him with His gifts. A handful of sand, thrown into the sea, is what sinning is, when compared to God‚Äôs Providence and mercy. Just like an abundant source of water is not impeded by a handful of dust, so is the Creator‚Äôs mercy not defeated by the sins of His creations. The natural that precedes faith is the path toward faith and toward God. Being implanted by God into our nature, it alone convinces us for the need to believe in God, Who had brought everything into being. Those, in whom the light of faith truly shines, never reach such unashamedness as to ask God: \\"Give us this,\\" or ‚Äî \\"Remove from us this.\\" Because their spiritual eyes ‚Äî with which they were blessed by that genuine Father, Who with His great love, countlessly transcends any fatherly love ‚Äî continually view the Father‚Äôs Providence, they are not concerned in the slightest about themselves. God can do more than anyone else, and can assist us by a far greater measure than we could ever ask for, or even imagine.\\" The mouth which is continuously giving thanks receives blessing from God. In the heart that always shows gratitude, grace abides (Brock, 1997). The aim of prayer is that we should acquire from it love of God, for in prayer are to be found all sorts of reason for loving God (Brock, 1997). Do not consider a long time spent in worship before God to be wasted (Brock, 1997) Undistracted prayer is prayer which produces the continual thought of God in the soul (Brock, 1997) At the time of darkness, more than anything else kneeling is helpful (Brock, 1997). The more a person enters the struggle for the sake of God, the closer will his heart come to freedom of converse in prayer (Brock, 1997). * Obeying God \\"To select a good deed depends on the initiator; to realize the intention ‚Äî that is God‚Äôs deed. Consequently, let us adhere to the rule, so that every good intention that comes to us is followed by frequent prayers, appealing to God to not only grant us help, but also if it is pleasing or not to Him. Because not every good intention comes from God, but only those that are beneficial. Sometimes, a person wishes something good, but God doesn‚Äôt help him ‚Äî maybe because the intention came from the devil and is not for our benefit; or maybe because it is beyond our strength as we have not attained the necessary spiritual level; or maybe because it doesn‚Äôt correspond to our calling; or maybe because the time is not right to initiate it; or maybe because we don‚Äôt have the necessary knowledge or strength to accomplish it; or maybe because circumstances will not contribute to its success. Besides this, the devil contrives in every way to paint it as something good so that having inclined us toward it, he could upset our spiritual tranquility or inflict harm on us. That‚Äôs why it is necessary for us to diligently examine all our good desires. Better still, do everything after seeking counsel.\\" Begin every action that is for God's sake joyfully (Brock, 1997). Make sure you see to small things, lest otherwise you may push aside important ones (Brock, 1997). * Love towards your neighbor, mercy, non-judgmentalness Do not demand love from your neighbor, because you will suffer if you don‚Äôt receive it; but better still, you indicate your love toward your neighbor and you will settle down. In this way, you will lead your neighbor toward love. Don‚Äôt exchange your love toward your neighbor for some type of object, because in having love toward your neighbor, you acquire within yourself Him, Who is most precious in the whole world. Forsake the petty so as to acquire the great; spurn the excessive and everything meaningless so as to acquire the valuable. Shelter the sinner if it brings you no harm. Through this you will encourage him toward repentance and reform ‚Äî and attract the Lord‚Äôs mercy to yourself. With a kind word and all possible means, fortify the infirm and the sorrowful and that Right Arm that controls everything, will also support you. With prayers and sorrow of your heart, share your lot with the aggrieved and the source of God‚Äôs mercy will open to your entreaties. When giving, give magnanimously with a look of kindness on your face, and give more than what is asked of you. Do not distinguish the worthy from the unworthy. Let everyone be equal to you for good deeds, so that you may be able to also attract the unworthy toward goodness, because through outside acts, the soul quickly learns to be reverent before God. He who shows kindness toward the poor has God as his guardian, and he who becomes poor for the sake of God will acquire abundant treasures. God is pleased when He sees people showing concern for others for His sake. When someone asks you for something, don‚Äôt think: \\"Just in case I might need it, I shall leave it for myself, and God ‚Äî through other people ‚Äî will give that person what he requires.\\" These types of thoughts are peculiar to people that are iniquitous and do not know God. A just and generous person would not compromise the honor of helping and relinquish it to another person, and he would never pass up an opportunity to help. Every beggar and every needy person receives the necessary essentials, because God doesn‚Äôt neglect anyone. But you, having sent away the destitute with nothing, spurned the honor offered to you by God and thereby, distanced yourself from His grace. Through God‚Äôs providence, he who respects every person for God‚Äôs sake, privately acquires help from every human being.\\"Isaac the Syrian, Readings, Orthodox Photos. Universal reconciliation Wac≈Çaw Hryniewicz (2007) argues that Brocks translation (1995) of the Second Part of Isaac's writings on Gehenna (discovered 1983) confirm claims of earlier Universalist historians such as John Wesley Hanson (1899) that Isaac was an advocate of universal reconciliation.Wac≈Çaw Hryniewicz The challenge of our hope: Christian faith in dialogue 2007 The 7th-century mystic, Isaac the Syrian, known also as Isaac of Nineveh is, in the history of the Church, one of the most courageous supporters of the eschatological hope of universal salvation.

She was born between 961 and 964 and died on 16 September in a year between 984 and 987.Yorke, St Edith Following her death in 984, she became the patron saint of her community at Wilton Abbey in Wiltshire and churches were dedicated to her in Wiltshire and in other parts of Anglo-Saxon England. Her biography was written by Goscelin and her feast day is on 16 September.  Life  Edgar the Peaceful Edith was the daughter of Edgar, by Wilfrida (or Wulfthryth), a woman of noble birth whom Edgar carried off from the nunnery at Wilton Abbey. He took her to his residence at Kemsing, near Sevenoaks, where Edith was born. Under Dunstan's direction, Edgar did penance for this crime by not wearing his crown for seven years. Although forms of bride-abduction were a traditional part of Anglo- Saxon society, whether Edgar took Wulfryth forcibly is unclear. What we do know is that she stayed with him for at least a year, and that for some time after her return to Wilton, they were on good terms. As soon as Wulfthryth could, she returned to Wilton, taking Edith with her. Edgar continued to support the abbey financially and also with land grants.Mrs Jameson, Legends of the monastic orders: as represented in the fine arts p. 95 online at books.google.com Edith was educated by the nuns of Wilton Abbey, where her mother had become abbess. Standing not far from a royal residence at Wilton, as part of its devotional work the Abbey functioned as the contemporary equivalent of a boarding school for young ladies, as did many abbeys at the time.Kate Pratt, St Edith at bishopwilton.com Edgar died in 975, when Edith was about thirteen. Religious texts, and in particular Edith's biography, written by Goscelin, have probably embellished many details of her life for political and dramatic effect. She was reported to have always dressed magnificently, the mediaeval chronicler William of Malmesbury stating that she wore luxurious golden garments.Catherine E. Karkov, The ruler portraits of Anglo-Saxon England (Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell Press, 2004), p. 114 When rebuked by √Üthelwold of Winchester, she answered that the judgment of God, which alone penetrated through the outward appearance, was alone true and infallible, adding, \\"For pride may exist under the garb of wretchedness; and a mind may be as pure under these vestments as under your tattered furs\\".Jameson, op. cit., p. 96 online at books.google.com It is known that as abbess St. Wilfrid, Edith's mother, preferred all the nuns at Wilton to dress in white habits with gold ornamentation, to the glory of God. Edgar continued to support Wulfthryth and Edith through the abbey. According to Goscelin, Edgar appointed her abbess of three abbeys, but she was at most thirteen at the time and appointed deputies to act in her place.Hollis, Writing the Wilton Women, p. 47 Edith built a church at Wilton and dedicated it to Saint Denis. Saint Dunstan was invited to the dedication and is said to have wept during the Mass. When he was asked why he wept, Dunstan said it was because he knew that Edith would die in three weeks. His prediction was proved to be correct when she died on 15 September 984: the story suggests that Edith was suffering from a fatal illness. She was buried at Wilton in the newly dedicated church.Sabine Baring Gould, 'S. Edith of Wilton' in his The Lives of the Saints, vol. X [September] (London: John Hodges, 1875), pp. 269-271  Sainthood  According to her hagiography, Edith was greatly celebrated for her learning, her beauty, and her sanctity. Minor miracles were reported shortly after her death. A week after she died, Edith appeared in glory to her mother and told her that the Devil had tried to accuse her, but that she had broken his head.Agnes Dunbar, 'Edith of Wilton', in her A Dictionary of Saintly Women (1904) The early mediaeval writer Goscelin reported that thirteen years after her death Edith appeared in visions to Dunstan and others, to inform them that her body was uncorrupted in the grave. He stated that Dunstan had opened her tomb in the presence of her mother, and that its \\"fragrant perfumes gave off the breath of paradise\\". However, the dating of this event must be doubted, as Dunstan himself died only four years after Edith, and it has been suggested that Goscelin may have chosen to enhance Edith's story by associating Dunstan with her translation. Following her exhumation and subsequent reburial, Edith's thumb was enshrined separately and became an important relic. She was elevated to sainthood at her mother's instigation, and also upon the initiative of her brother Aethelred, and her cause was supported by her nephew, Edmund Ironside. Edmund's successor, Canute, was renowned for his veneration of Edith. Goscelin wrote that while Canute was crossing the North Sea from England to Denmark, his fleet suffered a terrible storm and fearing for his life, he appealed to Edith. The storm calmed and on his return to England, Canute visited Wilton to give thanks for his rescue, \\"with solemn gifts, and published this great miracle with prolific testimony\\", subsequently ordering a golden shrine to Edith to be erected at the abbey.Goscelin, Vita Edithe, quoted in Hollis et al., Writing the Wilton Women (2004), p. 40 Edith became the focus of a major cult in Wilton and an important national saint.Karkov, op. cit., p. 116 Goscelin wrote her Life, under the title Vita Edithe, in about 1080.Susan Janet Ridyard, The Royal Saints of Anglo-Saxon England: a study of West Saxon and East Anglian cults (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 40 The community at Wilton, in looking to her as its heavenly patron, remembered her as a royal lady who had been dedicated to its protection.Ridyard, op. cit., p. 149 In his Liber Confortatorius, Goscelin wrote that he often thought of Edith and felt her presence.Jane Tibbetts Schulenburg, Forgetful of their sex: female sanctity and society, c. 500-1100 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998), p. 340 At least three churches were certainly dedicated to Edith, at Baverstock near Wilton, Bishop Wilton in Yorkshire, and Limpley Stoke in Wiltshire. In the 16th century, after some five hundred years, the third of these churches was rededicated to St Mary, but the other two dedications survive. Another eighteen churches in England are dedicated to an unspecified St Edith, and it has been suggested that most of these dedications are intended for Edith of Wilton.'H. N. R.', in William White, ed., Notes and Queries, vol. 44 (1877) p. 127 According to The Calendar of the Anglican Church, \\"There are twenty-one churches dedicated in this name in England, eight of which are in Lincolnshire, and three in Warwickshire. It is now impossible to assign them to their respective saints, especially as two were located in the same county; the one whom William of Malmesbury mentions with most honour was S. Editha of Wilton, whose festival he relates was in his time kept in several parts of the kingdom with great solemnity; probably the majority, if not all, these churches are named in her honour\\".Church of England, The calendar of the Anglican Church illustrated: with brief accounts of the Saints who have churches dedicated in their names, or whose images are most frequently met with in England (1851) pp. 226-227 Two stories exist related to supernatural events and supposed violations of Edith's remains. In one story, a monk from Ghent tried to cut off a piece of her tunic, and when his knife slipped, it hit her body, which gushed with blood. In another story a nun tried to steal her head-dress, but when she touched it, Edith's head raised itself up.Studies in the Early History of Shaftesbuy Abbey (Dorset County Council, 1999) Wilton Abbey, which was dedicated to St Edith and later to her mother St. Wilfrid as well, is typically described in the later Middle Ages as \\"the convent of the house and church of St Editha of Wilton\\" or as the \\"monastery of St Mary and St Editha of Wilton\\".William Campbell, Materials for a history of the reign of Henry VII from original documents (1873), pp. 74, 90 Later abbesses of Wilton told stories relating to private revelations given by St Edith in their times. In one story, in which an abbess's authority was perhaps being doubted, one of the members of the community had a vision in which she saw St Edith appear and put her own veil on the abbess's head, and said that she would bring many goods for the community but would not last long, and these words proved to be true. In another story, dating from the time of Herman, bishop of Sherborne, an abbess complained to the bishop that Edith was not protecting them. After she said this, however, the abbess's cousin had a dream of Edith, in which Edith asked why the abbess had said these things, and Edith had glowing hands and said, \\"Whatever I want to do with divine aid, I can\\", and after this was reported to the abbess, she made public repentance of her words. Edith's feast day is on 16 September, the day of, or the day after the date of her death,Francis Goldie, Saints of Wessex and Wiltshire (1885) p. 28 although it has also been reported as 15 September. She shares the date with her paternal aunt, At Edith, the abbess of Polesworth.  Seal  Two casts of the seal of Edith have survived, one dating to the fourteenth century and one dating to the sixteenth century.https://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2017/06/making- a-good-impression.html (accessed October 2018) The original seal matrix (now lost) would have dated to the period 975‚Äì984. The seal impressions show a portrait of her, standing with one hand raised and the other holding a book. The inscription identifies her as regalis adelpha, or 'royal sister', which is taken to be a reference both to her status as a nun and to her being the sister of Edward and Ethelred. The casts show that the handle of the matrix had a rich acanthus decoration: a gilded bronze seal matrix of an √Ülfric found in Hampshire in 2010 and now at the Fitzwilliam museum in Cambridge has a similar handle.https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/542556 (accessed October 2018)  References   Bibliography  * *  External links  * * St Edith of Wilton at catholic.org * St Edith of Wilton at Britannia.com * At Oxford ODNB Category:960s births Category:980s deaths Category:10th-century English people Category:10th-century English women Category:10th-century Christian saints Category:Anglo-Saxon royalty Category:Anglo-Saxon saints Category:Anglo-Saxon nuns Category:People from Sevenoaks Category:Female saints of medieval England Category:House of Wessex Category:English princesses Category:People from Kent (before 1889) Category:10th-century Christian nuns ","title":"Edith of Wilton"},{"id":"2536391","text":"Luca Pitti (1398‚Äì1472) was a Florentine banker during the period of the republic presided over by Cosimo de' Medici. He was awarded a knighthood, and received lavish presents from both the Signory of Firenze and the Medici family as a reward for helping maintain the government during the last years of Cosimo's rule when Cosimo was too old and feeble to maintain power alone. As the head magistrate of Florence, known as \\"The Gonfalonier of Justice,\\" he wielded great power and influence. In August, 1458, he staged a coup to seize control of Florentine government in the name of its existing ruler, the elderly and now frail Cosimo de' Medici. In effect he wished to strengthen the existing government, as a result many leading citizens were banished, and many other citizens were driven from power. The newly formed government was to last eight years with Cosimo as its figurehead, the reality being he was too frail to maintain power alone. Pitti's chief opponent at this time was Girolamo Machiavelli who was banished. However, he travelled the neighbouring principalities whipping up opposition to the new Florentine government. He was consequently declared a rebel, betrayed and returned to Florence where he mysteriously died in prison. Pitti was then ennobled and very wealthy indeed, Niccol√≤ Machiavelli in his History of Florence estimates no less a sum than twenty thousand ducats was presented to him. It was then that he sought to rival the glory, if not power, of the Medici and began construction of the Palazzo Pitti intended to rival the palazzo of the Medici. He also began work on a villa at Rusciano. For the Palazzo Pitti, legend has it he \\"decided to employ the most brilliant architect of the times, whom he ordered to make the windows as big as the doors of the Medici residence and create an internal courtyard that was large enough to contain the whole of the Medici's palace on the Via Larga\\". This is almost certainly apocryphal as the architect Brunelleschi often credited with the design had been dead since twelve years. The true architect, often thought to be Luca Fancelli, was less well known at the time and the new palazzo, while awe inspiring, was not a true rival to the magnificence of the Medici residences. Machiavelli also states that Pitti would give sanctuary to any criminal within his walls if they could be of use in their building or decoration. Machiavelli also hints that Pitti's wealth was further increased by bribes and presents in return for favours. These allegations may or may not be true, one should remember that Machiavelli was not only opposed to the Medici himself, but also a kinsman of Pitti's arch enemy Girolamo Machiavelli who had been most likely murdered by the government which in effect Pitti controlled. It has been said that Pitti wished to become first citizen and dictator himself. After the death of Cosimo in 1464, he conspired to overthrow and murder Piero di Cosimo de' Medici. He was pardoned by Piero after the failure of the plot and thereafter supported him. Pitti's prosperity declined from 1464, following the death of Cosimo, his patron. Pitti died in 1472, work on his grand palazzo had stopped in 1465, and he was not to see it completed.

During the early 1990s, he was one of the artists who initiated the Spanish- language dancehall variety of reggae music. Early examples of this were the international and somewhat mainstream songs, \\"Te Ves Buena\\" and \\"Tu Pum Pum\\". Both songs, performed in Spanish deejaying style, were very successful in North America. After getting his foot in the door of the commercial market, many other Spanish-language dancehall reggae artists became famous in the mainstream as well.Santos, Mayra. 1996. \\"Puerto Rican Underground.\\" Centro 8, no. 1 & 2: 219‚Äì231. He has a unique, easy to listen to style of dance music and has produced many well-known songs all over Latin America. His musical works have become popular in Latin America over the last few years. This style is called reggae en Espa√±ol, because he makes dancehall reggae music with Spanish-language lyrics and is an early precursor to reggaeton. Early history El General began singing and composing songs at the age of 12 in his home in R√≠o Abajo, Panama. Upon receiving a scholarship, the young artist moved to the United States to study business administration, and became a professional accountant. He started his musical career when he was 19 years old, and for 17 years, his albums achieved gold status 32 times and platinum 17 times. Popular reggae and reggaeton music in Panama was (and is still) called plena.Marshall, Wayne. 2008. \\"M√∫sica Negra to Reggaeton Latino: The Cultural Politics of Nation, Migration, and Commercialization.\\" Songs like \\"Muevelo\\" (1991), \\"Tu Pum Pum\\" (1991), \\"Rica y Apretadita\\" and \\"Te Ves Buena\\" are among his greatest hits. In 1992, El General received an MTV award for Best Latin Video with the great success of \\"Muevelo\\" produced by Pablo \\"Pabanor\\" Ortiz and Erick \\"More\\" Morillo. In 1993, El General won the Rap Artist of the Year Award at the Lo Nuestro Awards. His breakout performance came in 1994, when he was featured on the song \\"Robi-Rob's Boriqua Anthem\\" from C+C Music Factory's album Anything Goes. During this time, he started working with Chino Rodriguez, an entrepreneur in the Latin music industry, who convinced Franco a.k.a. El General (as his close friends and family would call him), to perform a salsa song before his performance of \\"Robi-Rob's Boriqua Anthem\\". The performance was at the Madison Square Garden produced by Ralph Mercado (owner of RMM Records and who always produced large Latino events in New York). The fans were surprised that El General (Franco) sang a salsa song. Ralph Mercado gave El General more time in the tight schedule of stage allotment to do the salsa song before the scheduled performance of \\"Boriqua Anthem\\". Chino Rodriguez was able to convince Ralph Mercado to allow more time so that El General could surprise his fans. Retirement In 2004, he announced his retirement from the music industry to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

It sat upon a hemispherical rocker, and was operated by the players touching the \\"solary projectors\\", which were handles on either side of the game. Unlike most talking boards which are activated by a planchette, the Ka-Bala used a large black marble as an indicator; the marble ran around a circular track on the surface of the game. In addition to indicating the letters and numbers printed around the track, the marble could also be used to select one of twenty-two Major Arcana cards of occult tarot supplied with the game. Each tarot card had the fortune it predicted printed on the back. The game also had the twelve zodiac signs marked along the track; these could be used to generate a simple horoscope. In the center of the rocking board, the \\"Eye of Zohar\\" was mounted; this plastic eyeball would spin as the board was agitated by the players.

He served the king as a Gentleman of the Privy chamber, and Esquire of the Body to the King. His wife, Mary Boleyn, is known to history as a mistress of King Henry VIII and the sister of Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn. Biography William Carey was the second son of Sir Thomas Carey (1455‚Äì1500), of Chilton Foliat in Wiltshire, and his wife, Margaret Spencer, daughter of Sir Robert Spencer and Eleanor Beaufort, and grandson of Sir William Cary of Cockington, Devon, an eminent Lancastrian.Michael Riordan, 'Carey, William (c.1496‚Äì1528)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2009. This Cary family were anciently recorded in Devon, and originally held the manors at Cockington and Clovelly in that county.Burke, Landed Gentry (18th edition), 1965, ASIN: B005VOJIVW Eleanor was the daughter of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, whose brother John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, was the father of Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, grandmother of King Henry VIII; thus William and Henry VIII were third cousins. William's maternal aunt was Catherine Spencer, Countess of Northumberland, and through her, he was first cousin to Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, the former suitor of his sister-in-law Anne Boleyn. On 4 February 1520, he was married to Mary Boleyn, the elder daughter of Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard. They resided at Aldenham in Hertfordshire. Shortly after their marriage, Mary became the mistress of King Henry VIII. The Boleyns received grants of land, and Carey himself profited from his wife's unfaithfulness, being granted manors and estates by the King while it was in progress. Carey was also a noted art collector, and he introduced the famed Dutch artist, Lucas Horenbout, to the Kingdom of England in the mid-1520s. Perhaps one of the reasons the athletic King Henry VIII favoured Carey was the fact that Carey appears to have been fond of activities such as riding, hunting and jousting. Carey distinguished himself in jousting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. Anne Boleyn, Mary's sister, caught Henry's eye a year after his affair with Mary ended. Henry proposed marriage to her in 1527. William Carey did not live to enjoy his sister-in-law's prosperity, since he died of the sweating sickness the following year. Brian Tuke, Henry's secretary at the time of Carey's death wrote this to Lord Legat the day after his death: \\"Now is word common that M. Cary, which before I came lay in the chamber where I lie, and with whom at my first coming I met here in this place, saying that he had been with his wife at Plashey, and would not be seen within, because he would ride again and hunt, is dead of the sweat. Our Lord have mercy on his soul; and hold his hand over us.\\" He died greatly in debt, and his wife was reduced to pawning her jewellery before Queen Anne Boleyn arranged a pension for her. Children of William Carey and Mary Boleyn William Carey and Mary Boleyn were the parents of two children: *Catherine Carey (c. 1524 ‚Äì 15 January 1568). Maid of Honour to Anne of Cleves and Catherine Howard. She was married to the Puritan Sir Francis Knollys, Knight of the Garter. She was later lady- in-waiting to her cousin, Elizabeth I. One of her daughters, Lettice Knollys, became the second wife of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, the favourite of Elizabeth I. *Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon (4 March 1526 ‚Äì 23 July 1596). He was ennobled by Queen Elizabeth I just after her coronation and created Knight of the Garter in 1561. When Henry was dying, Elizabeth offered him the Boleyn family title, Earl of Ormonde, which he had long sought, but he refused the honour. Because of Mary's affair, it has been suggested that Catherine and Henry may have been instead Henry VIII's biological children (see Issue of Mary Boleyn). The veracity of this claim is the subject of historical debate. Ancestry  In popular culture  Carey's life, his marriage to Mary Carey, and his death are fictionalized in Philippa Gregory's novel The Other Boleyn Girl. The story has been made into film twice, with Carey portrayed by Anthony Howell in the 2003 film and Benedict Cumberbatch in 2008.

They are produced primarily in figurine form, but also are released as ornaments, in flat artwork and various other forms. They were created by, and are still designed by, Real Musgrave, and the figurines are manufactured by Collectible World Studios. Unlike many artists behind collectible lines, Musgrave not only creates the flat artwork for them, but also sculpts them. Both Real and his wife, Muff, have enjoyed nearly complete creative control over the line. History The story of the Pocket Dragon goes back to a limited set of black and white drawings done by Real Musgrave in the mid-1970s, depicting a small dragon in the pocket of a tweed sport jacket. Those dragons were originally based on Real and Muff's dog Flower. The first set of Pocket Dragon figurines went on sale in June 1989, and included twenty-seven of the figures. They were produced in Stoke-on-Trent, England. In 1998, an animated television series was produced based on Pocket Dragons, called Pocket Dragon Adventures. It ran for fifty-two half hour episodes or 104 European 15 minute episodes. The writers of the series collaborated with both Musgraves, and Real contributed designs for virtually every episode. As of 2006, over 400 different Pocket Dragons figures had been released, as well as games, books and hundreds of other products. Real and Muff Musgrave announced their retirement in the fall of 2005, along with the Pocket Dragon figurine collection, to be effective on December 31, 2006. In May 2006 the distributor Collectible World Studios went into receivership due to high debts and ceased trading. The production and distribution of what would be the last Pocket Dragon pieces was uncertain. Since then the official website and the website of the distributor are no longer online. Xystos, a company linked with the Collectables (Fine Glass and China) LTD company bought CWS later in 2006. On November 12, 2006, what was probably the last ever UK Pocket Dragons event was held at Collectables (Fine Glass and China) LTD, Stockton on Tees. Real and Muff Musgrave had retired and were attending to abandoned animals, but Real still produced Pocket Dragon products licensed with other companies. The proceeds from sales benefit animal charities with which the Musgraves worked. In 2011 they continued their collaborations with Precious Gifts in Maryland to produce a special limited edition figurine to benefit the Humane Society of Flower Mound (in Texas).

Background  In 1987, Portee claimed to have witnessed Don Taylor shoot and kill Terrance Joyner on a Bronx, New York, street in the early hours of August 16, 1987. Based on Portee's eyewitness testimony, Taylor was convicted on April 25, 1989 and sentenced to 22¬Ω years to life.

Deference (also called submission or passivity) is the condition of submitting to the espoused, legitimate influence of one's superior or superiors.John B. Kirbya, \\"Early American Politics‚ÄîThe Search for Ideology: An Historiographical Analysis and Critique of the Concept of 'Deference,'\\" The Journal of Politics, Volume 32, Issue 04, November 1970 pp 808‚Äì838 Deference implies a yielding or submitting to the judgment of a recognized superior, out of respect or reverence. Deference has been studied extensively by political scientists, sociologists, and psychologists. Politics Smolenski (2005) examines deference in colonial Pennsylvania, to see how claims to political authority were made, justified, and accepted or rejected. He focuses on the \\"colonial speech economy,\\" that is, the implicit rules that determined who was allowed to address whom and under what conditions, and describes how the qualities that inspired deference changed in the province from 1691 to 1764. The Quaker elite initially established a monopoly on political leadership based on what they believed to be their inherent civic virtue grounded in their religious and social class. By 1760, this view had been discredited and replaced with the consensus that civic virtue was an achieved, not an inherent, attribute and that it should be determined by the display of appropriate manliness and the valor of men who were willing to take up arms for the common defense of the colony. Further, Pennsylvanians came to believe that all white men, not just wealthy property owners, were equally capable of achieving political voice. Martial masculinity, therefore, became the defining characteristic of the ideal citizen and marked a significant transformation in the way individuals justified their right to represent the public interest.John Smolenski, \\"From Men of Property to Just Men,\\" Early American Studies, An Interdisciplinary Journal, Fall 2005, Vol. 3 Issue 2, pp 253‚Äì285 Sociology Erving Goffman, a Canadian-born sociologist and writer, explored the relationship between deference and demeanor in his 1967 essay \\"The Nature of Deference and Demeanor\\". According to Goffman, a person with a poor demeanor will be held in lower esteem in the eyes of society. The same is true for people who behave in a good demeanor, however: society will hold them in a higher esteem. An example of this situation can be seen through the way a person acts in a social setting. e.g. a man pulling out a chair for a woman at a restaurant. On the other end of the spectrum, a person not bathing before they go to a fancy dinner party. These examples can be defined as presentational deference. Demeanor does not only limit itself to the actions of an individual, but also the appearance of an individual. A person offers themselves to a social group through a good appearance or a well demeanored appearance. When an individual has a well demeanored appearance it makes interaction between people easier. After a person is socially accepted to a group, it is expected that they will conform to interactional norms. Through acting on those norms, people receive deference. Psychology There is ongoing debate among psychologists as to the extent to which deference in a relationship is determined by a person's innate personality type or is the result of a person's experiences and conditioning. In interpersonal relationships, a partner can assume a submissive role to fit in or to make him or herself acceptable to the other partner, and can be a benign aspect of a relationship. On the other hand, it may be an indication of an interpersonal problem, such as partner abuse. If one or both of the people are experiencing chronic, pervasive emotional distress then the sex partners or individuals may require psychological evaluation. In interpersonal relationships, some people prefer or are willing to adopt a submissive role in sexual activities or personal matters. The level and type of submission can vary from person to person, and from one context to another; and also is dependent on the other partner being willing to assume control in those situations. Some people can include occasional acts of submission in an otherwise conventional sex life, or adopt a submissive lifestyle. Biology Submission is also a common behavior in the animal kingdom, with a prevalence that spans the whole vertebrate-invertebrate gamut. Signs of submission are used either to preempt dangerous combat (in which case they usually appear at the beginning of an encounter) or to establish a dominance hierarchy (in which case they usually appear after the encounter). Often the behaviors used to appease the opponent or yield to his authority are of a stereotyped nature (e.g., bowing of the head, crouching, prostration, placing the tail between the legs, lying on ones back, grooming) but can sometimes develop into elaborate ritualistic performances (e.g., food supplication by the submissive animal, regurgitation of food by the dominant and ingestion of the regurgitated food by the submissive). It is believed by some researchers that part of the instinctive machinery subserving these behaviors is related to that used to evade or withstand predator attacks where similar behaviors appear (e.g., crouching, prostration, lying on the back).Morris, Desmond. (1967). The Naked Ape: A Zoologist‚Äôs Study of the Human Animal. pp. 99-127. London: Vintage Books . Other researchers have speculated what functions, if any, these behaviors may play in modern humans and come up with several possibilities (mostly from an evolutionary perspective); that they help in the establishment of parent-child attachment and pair bond formation, that they promote the development of theory of mind,Pdf. that they play a role in the emergence of language,Robin, Dunbar. (1996). Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press . and that they may lay behind the higher cooperative and communicative abilities of humans.

He wrote numerous works on South African birds and was instrumental in the establishment of Kruger National Park and in early measures to protect South African wildlife.  Life and work  Haagner was born in Hankey near Humansdorp where his father, Sigmund, an accountant at the explosives factory in Modderfontein, taught him at home. Young Haagner then worked alongside his father in the accounts department but found natural history of greater interest. At the age of 19, he published a note on the Cape Monitor followed by several papers on the birds of Modderfontein in the Ibis around 1901‚Äì1902. He was one of the founding members of the South African Ornithologists' Union begun in Johannesburg on 8 April 1904, an organization that amalgamated with the Transvaal Biological Society in 1916 to form the South African Biological Society. Haagner worked in the Transvaal Museum from 1906 collecting grass species among other specimens and becoming an assistant in ornithology from 1908 to J.W.B. Gunning. Along with Gunning he began to assemble a collection of birds from the region. Haagner left the museum in 1911, was succeeded by Austin Roberts, and became director of the Pretoria Zoological Gardens. During his directorship, animals were transferred to zoos in Europe and the United States through dealers in wild animals, leading to accusations that he was involved in their trade. An inquiry committee in 1926 concluded that he had used his official position to further personal interests and led to his termination from work. He then worked at a farm near Beira, Mozambique and returned to South Africa somewhere in the 1940s and settled in Pietermartizburg, working as an accountant. A lecture tour through the United States in 1920 led to the University of Pittsburgh awarding him an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1922. He took an interest in the Kruger National Park and played an important role, along with J. Stevenson-Hamilton, in drafting the National Parks Acts of 1926. He was, along with R.H. Ivy, a co- author of Sketches of South African Bird-Life and compiled A Checklist of the Birds of South Africa with J. W. B. Gunning, first director of the Transvaal Museum in 1910. He helped revise the classification of the South African Cisticola species. Along with W. T. Hornaday, he wrote The vanishing game of South Africa: A warning and an appeal (1922). Haagner was an honorary member of the British Ornithologists' Union, the Royal Hungarian Bureau of Ornithology and the American Ornithologists' Union.  Personal life  Haagner married Johanna A. Moll in May 1910 and they had a daughter. After the death of Johanna, he married Gwendoline E. Allen in 1922 and they had a son. Haagner died at his home in Pietermaritzburg in 1962.

Early life Samuel Curtis Upham was born in Montpelier, Vermont to Samuel Upham and Sally Hatch, a zealous Methodist farm couple. Upham left home at the age of 20, abandoning his family's hopes he would go into farming or blacksmithing, instead finding work in New York City as a clerk. In 1842 he joined the navy, achieving the rating of master's mate before his discharge three years later. After the navy, he worked as a bookkeeper in Philadelphia, where he met and married Anne Bancroft. California In January 1849, Upham sailed on The Osceola to San Francisco, via Rio de Janeiro and Talcahuana, arriving in California on August 5, 1849 and participating in the California Gold Rush. Proving unsuccessful as a gold miner, Upham moved to Sacramento and founded the Sacramento Transcript, California's first daily newspaper published outside San Francisco. Becoming homesick in 1850, he sold his shares in the newspaper and travelled back to Philadelphia. Upham later wrote about his adventures in Notes of a Voyage to California via Cape Horn, published in 1878. In the book he writes, \\"Descriptions of a life on the ocean wave read vary prettily on shore, but the reality of a sea voyage speedily dispels the romance.\\" The book also pays close attention to the bawdy history of Sacramento, and includes lengthy appendices on California journalism and the California exhibition at the 1876 Centennial. In 1878 Upham also published Scenes in El Dorado in the Years 1849-50. On returning to Philadelphia Upham resumed his family role, fathering two sons and supporting his wife and children with a stationery and toiletries shop. On March 20, 1860 he became one of the founder shareholders in the People's Pacific Railroad Company. Civil War At the start of the Civil War Upham began marketing patriotic items to support the Union, and novelty items mocking the Confederacy, such as cards depicting the head of Confederate President Jefferson Davis on the body of a jackass. In February 1862, he acquired a sample of Confederate money and quickly started producing his own counterfeits. His first printing consisted of 3,000 five-dollar notes, each stamped at the bottom with the words, \\"Fac-simile Confederate Note - Sold wholesale and retail by S.C. Upham 403 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia.\\" He sold his first batch for a penny per copy. Cotton smugglers in the south quickly began buying Upham's novelty notes, trimming off the notice at the bottom and flooding the Confederate economy with the bogus bills. Before long Upham was advertising what he called \\"mementos of the Rebellion\\" in the New York Tribune, Harper's Weekly, and other papers. He also advertised himself willing to buy genuine Confederate notes and stamps, as samples he could later duplicate. By late 1862 Upham was selling twenty-eight variations of Confederate bill denominations and postage stamps, with currency notes selling for five cents apiece. At some point Upham also switched from letter stock to high-quality banknote paper for his forgeries. Upham's operation caused a dilemma for the Union government, as some members of Lincoln's administration genuinely feared that to permit an enterprise like Upham's to carry on from the North would provoke southerners to retaliate by counterfeiting northern currency. But the Union government did not possess any legal means to stop Upham - because the Union government did not recognize the legitimacy of the Confederate government, they could not prosecute someone for counterfeiting Confederate currency. So at first, Union officials simply tried to persuade Upham to cease operations - however, when he declined Upham soon found himself under investigation by these same officials, who alleged he was counterfeiting Union currency as well. Upham vehemently denied this claim, but likely would have gone to trial had U.S. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton not personally intervened to dismiss the case. Some conspiracy theorists allege Stanton was also Upham's source for genuine banknote paper, in a deliberate effort to destabilize the Confederate economy. The Congress of the Confederacy responded to the flood of counterfeit bills by imposing the death sentence on convicted counterfeiters. Upham would later brag the Confederacy put a $10,000 reward on his capture, dead or alive. He later wrote, \\"During the publication of those facsimile notes I was the 'best abused man' in the Union. Senator Foote, in a speech before the rebel Congress, at Richmond, in 1862, said I had done more to injure the Confederate cause than General McClellan and his army...\\" Upham later claimed he had \\"printed from March 12, 1862, to August 1, 1863, one million five hundred and sixty four thousand facsimile Rebel notes, of denominations ranging from five cents to one hundred dollars, and presume the aggregate issue, in dollars and cents, would amount to the round number of fifteen millions of dollars\\". Some modern analyses estimate his fake Confederate money amounted to between .93% and 2.78% of the Confederacy's total money supply. By the end of the war other printers were making and selling their own counterfeit bills, prompting Upham to lower his prices. The complete devaluation of genuine Confederate currency by later war years further cut into his business. Southerners were largely eschewing Confederate notes, instead relying on barter or northern bills. CSA notes were rarely used after the fall of Vicksburg (July 1863) west of the Mississippi because of the difficulty of transporting notes across the Union controlled river. Mr. Jones, from his post war book \\"Life of a Rebel Clerk\\" states that Mr. CC Thayer (a signer of many CSA notes) tried to transport a large amount of CSA notes from Mississippi to Texas (CSA's Department of the Trans-Mississippi) but failed and returned to Richmond in late 1863. Upham discontinued his facsimile business in late 1863 and returned to selling stationery, perfume, and hair dye. His notes were still being used in the war-torn South by Union soldiers and other persons after he shut down his business. Post-War and death In his later years Upham wrote lyrics for a number of hymns. He penned the words to Centennial ode. Song and chorus (1875), Columbia's centennial greeting, A cantata (1876), and The Old School House down by the Mill (1877). When Upham died of stomach cancer in 1885, a minor mystery ensued over the whereabouts of his wealth. His estate was valued at $4,889.97, but he claimed to have sold upwards of $50,000 worth of counterfeit notes during the war. The proceeds of his counterfeiting operation have never been found. Collectibles Since his death many of Upham's counterfeit bills and postage stamps, and some of the perfume bottles he patented and used in his stationery and perfume business, have become valuable collector's items.

It was originally established in 1985 through the fusion of the Revolutionary Anarchist Organisation (, or ORA) and the Tuscan Union of Anarchist Communists (, or UCAT). In 1986 the Congress of the ORA/UCAT adopted the name FdCA. It has offices and member groups in various Italian regions as well as in Switzerland. It is part of the international anarchist communist movement, and traces its roots to the historically important organisational theories of the Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists, first put forward in France in 1926 by Russian refugees including Nestor Makhno, Ida Mett and Piotr Arshinov. From these roots, it draws its founding principles: *Unity of theory and strategy; *Tactical homogeneity; *A federal structure; and *Internal collective responsibility for militant activities. Its highest internal decision-making body is its National Congress (composed of all members) which elects a Council of Delegates that manages the organisation between congresses. Its political activities tend towards the self-organisation of its base of support through political struggle, in the workplace and social arena alike, and in labour unions as well as other political movements. It encourages close study of the civil economy and the evolution of capitalist political institutions. The FdCA was a member of the now-defunct International Libertarian Solidarity network. Today, together with other platformist and especifista organisations around the world, the FdCA participates in the running of the Anarkismo.net website. Along with 7 other organisations, it set up the Anarkismo European Coordination in February 2011.

After seeing active service during the Irish Rebellion of 1798, he fought as a troop commander in many of the battles of the Peninsular War and the Hundred Days. He went on to become the Artillery Commander, Northern District with delegated command over all the forces of the four northern counties before being promoted to Deputy Adjutant-General, Royal Artillery. Ross was the last person to hold the title of Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, assuming responsibility for the artillery component sent to take part in the Crimean War under Lord Raglan. After the war he served as Master Gunner, St James's Park, a senior ceremonial post in the Royal Artillery. Military career Born the son of Major John Ross and Jane Ross (n√©e Buchan), Ross was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 6 March 1795. Promoted to lieutenant on 10 May 1796, he saw active service during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and, following promotion to captain lieutenant on 1 September 1803, was elevated to the role of adjutant on 15 September 1803. He was further promoted to second captain on 26 July 1804 on appointment as adjutant of the 4th Battalion, Royal Artillery at Woolwich Barracks.Heathcote, p. 255 Promoted to captain on 24 July 1806, he was given command of a troop of the Royal Horse Artillery, which later became famous as the Chestnut Troop.Duncan, Volume II, p. 31 In 1809, during the Peninsular War, the troop landed at Lisbon and joined Sir Arthur Wellesley's army. Ross's guns were attached to the Light Division and, with Robert Craufurd, took part in several actions during the Battle of the C√¥a in July 1810 and the Battle of Bussaco in September 1810.Ross, pp. 10‚Äì12 When Andr√© Mass√©na began his retreat from the Lines of Torres Vedras, Ross's troop joined the pursuit, seeing action at the Battle of Pombal, the Battle of Redinha and the Battle of Casal Novo in March 1811 as well as at the Battle of Sabugal in April 1811 and the Battle of Fuentes de O√±oro in May 1811. He was rewarded with promotion to major on 31 December 1811. Portrait of Ross by Thomas Heaphy circa 1813 Ross was present at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812, the Siege of Badajoz in April 1812 and at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812. After the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813, Ross's guns were continually with the most advanced troops, and they captured the sole remaining piece of artillery held by the French troops. He was rewarded with promotion to lieutenant colonel on 3 July 1813. In July 1813, Ross also took part in the Battle of the Pyrenees, which was followed by actions at Bidassoa in October 1813 and Nivelle in November 1813. During the Battle of the Nive in December 1813, Ross had his horse shot out from under him, but he was unharmed and in April 1814 he fought at the Battle of Bayonne. Following these military successes, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 4 January 1815. During the Hundred Days, Ross was engaged at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, and although half his guns were disabled, the remainder took part in the pursuit of the French.Heathcote, p. 256 He was awarded the Russian Order of St. Anna, 2nd Class on 8 October 1815. Two gunners and their artillery piece depicted in 1825 at which time Ross was serving as Artillery Commander, Northern District Ross became the Artillery Commander, Northern District in 1825 with delegated command over all the forces of the four most northern counties in England. Promoted to colonel on 22 July 1830, he became Deputy Adjutant-General, Royal Artillery on 23 April 1840, receiving promotion to major-general on 23 November 1841 and to lieutenant general on 11 November 1851. He became Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance on 2 May 1854 and in that capacity was responsible for checking the artillery component sent to take part in the Crimean War under Lord Raglan personally ensuring that every battery was despatched from the United Kingdom to the front in a high state of efficiency. He also founded the facility that was to become the Royal Artillery Experimental Unit at Shoeburyness. He was promoted to full general on 28 November 1854 and, following the abolition of the Board of Ordnance, became Adjutant-General, Royal Artillery on 22 May 1855. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 5 July 1855 and also served as colonel commandant of the Royal Horse Artillery. Ross retired in April 1858; he became Master Gunner, St James's Park in 1864 and, having been promoted to field marshal on 1 January 1868, he became lieutenant- governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea on 3 August 1868. He died a few months later at his home in Knightsbridge in London on 10 December 1868.

It is implemented by Project Harmony and funded by the US Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs through the 1992 Freedom Support Act. The program allows the students, educators and community members of Armenia to access and share information. It is meant to increase the U.S-Armenian partnership at the schools and within the community, increase interaction between schools and the community, and civic engagement on the local, national and international levels. The Armenian School Connectivity Program supports the integration of educational technologies that is supposed to strengthen democracy and support civil society and cultural understanding. Recruitment process The schools recruited to the ASCP went through a competition completed on October 15, 2004. During the site set-up of the ASCP, local schools were affected by the rearrangements initiated within the framework of Armenia Education Quality and Relevance Project. The school building maintenance funds increased, becoming higher than the staff/student number involved in the ASCP network; this resulted in some ASCP schools to merge into one another, decreasing the number of schools involved in the network. A program assessment had a few more schools removed from the network for not having an adequate level of participation in the program. In the end, 330 schools were selected from all over Armenia to be a part of the Program network. The recruitment process for the ASCEP was held under the Program Promotion and Enrollment Competition. Project Harmony announced the launching of the recruitment along with a program introductory highlighting the principals and specifics about the recruitment requirements and process that were distributed to all schools within the region. There was a Q&A; session that applicants received; afterwards, possible applicants were given a follow- up consultation meeting with Project Harmony in all of the 11 regions. The selected schools that were part of the ASCP program were chosen based on the following criteria implemented by Project Harmony: * The principal of the school had to support the program and be willing to share the Internet Computer Center classroom with the community and other schools * The school‚Äôs academic background had to meet certain quantitative and qualitative measures * There had to be a high motivation within the school for academics and administrative staff to use the classroom effectively * The community was involved in the school activities * The school participated in any U.S. government programs * The school participated in any improvement programs organized by either NGOs, the ministry of education, and other related organizations. * The school's geographic location The online scrapbook The online scrapbook is a competition meant to assess the development of the Armenian School Connectivity Program within its first six years running. Project harmony involvement The responsibility of Project Harmony (PH) was the long-term sustainability of the program. From the years 2000-2007, Project Harmony completed 3 interrelated school connectivity programs in Armenia. The first program implemented by PH, is referred to as Armenia connectivity 2000 (AC2K), outlined the expansion of Internet access through assessing the information and communication technology needs within the education system. Project harmony brought together organizations and private donors to invest in ICT projects for Armenia. These projects were meant to help build a demonstration network of 24-internet- connected secondary schools from the city of Yerevan and a few regions close to the capital. This led to two following grants in support of the Armenia School Connectivity Program, eventually reaching across Armenia, and creating a network of 330 secondary schools with an Internet Computer Center (ICC). The program hired and appropriately trained approximately 600 ICC staff. The people responsible for the ICC program created outreach activities and information literacy programs for the local community. For the isolated and under-served communities of Armenia, project harmony expanded Internet accessibility through the Mobile Internet Lab project. The purpose of the Mobile Internet Lab was to ride through Armenia, offering basic computer and Internet literacy to the school and community members in remote villages. The Mobile Internet Lab was an altered flatbed truck with 5 workstations, a printer, a scanner, and a digital camera and satellite connection. Official transfer On May 2007, Project Harmony announced the final step to officially transfer the Armenian School Connectivity Program from the U.S government to the Government of Armenia. From the years 2005-2007, Project Harmony and the Armenian government worked together on the transfer of the ASCP to the Ministry of Education and Science. The Ministry of Education and Science, a financial co-sponsor of the ASCP sought to adopt the ASCP infrastructure and the systems and strategies employed to deliver ICT-enhanced educational activities. The completion of the transfer was anticipated on June 30, 2007. Until then, Project Harmony is responsible for sustaining the ASCEP. The National Center for Educational Technologies (NCET) was authorized the responsibility of completing the agency after the official transfer on July 1, 2007.

The aim of this discipline is characterizing and modifying surfaces for both scientific and technological purposes. Nanotribological research has historically involved both direct and indirect methodologies. Microscopy techniques, including Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM), Atomic-Force Microscope (AFM) and Surface Forces Apparatus, (SFA) have been used to analyze surfaces with extremely high resolution, while indirect methods such as computational methods and Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) have also been extensively employed. Changing the topology of surfaces at the nanoscale, friction can be either reduced or enhanced more intensively than macroscopic lubrication and adhesion; in this way, superlubrication and superadhesion can be achieved. In micro- and nano-mechanical devices problems of friction and wear, that are critical due to the extremely high surface volume ratio, can be solved covering moving parts with super lubricant coatings. On the other hand, where adhesion is an issue, nanotribological techniques offer a possibility to overcome such difficulties.  History  Friction and wear have been technological issues since ancient periods. On the one hand, the scientific approach of the last centuries towards the comprehension of the underlying mechanisms was focused on macroscopic aspects of tribology. On the other hand, in nanotribology, the systems studied are composed of nanometric structures, where volume forces (such as those related to mass and gravity) can often be considered negligible compared to surface forces. Scientific equipment to study such systems have been developed only in the second half of the 20th century. In 1969 the very first method to study the behavior of a molecularly thin liquid film sandwiched between two smooth surfaces through the SFA was developed. From this starting point, in 1980s researchers would employ other techniques to investigate solid state surfaces at the atomic scale. Direct observation of friction and wear at the nanoscale started with the first Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM), which can obtain three-dimensional images of surfaces with atomic resolution; this instrument was developed by Gerd Binnig and Henrich Rohrer in 1981. STM can study only conductive materials, but in 1985 with the invention of the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) by Binning and his colleagues, also non conductive surfaces can be observed. Afterwards, AFMs were modified to obtain data on normal and frictional forces: these modified microscopes are called Friction Force Microscopes (FFM) or Lateral Force Microscopes (LFM). The term \\"Nanotribology\\" was first used in the title of a 1990 publication reporting AFM studies of \\"stick-slip\\" friction on diamond films. \\"Nanotribology\\" was first defined as a sub-field of tribology encompassing a range of experimental and computational methods in a 1991 publication reporting QCM measurements of the sliding friction levels of one-atom thick films. From the beginning of the 21st century, computer-based atomic simulation methods have been employed to study the behaviour of single asperities, even those composed by few atoms. Thanks to these techniques, the nature of bonds and interactions in materials can be understood with a high spatial and time resolution.  Surface analysis  = Surface forces apparatus = The SFA (Surface Forces Apparatus) is an instrument used for measuring physical forces between surfaces, such as adhesion and capillary forces in liquids and vapors, and van der Waals interactions. Since 1969, the year in which the first apparatus of this kind was described, numerous versions of this tool have been developed. SFA 2000, which has fewer components and is easier to use and clean than previous versions of the apparatus, is one of the currently most advanced equipment utilized for nanotribological purposes on thin films, polymers, nanoparticles and polysaccharides. SFA 2000 has one single cantilever which is able to generate mechanically coarse and electrically fine movements in seven orders of magnitude, respectively with coils and with piezoelectric materials. The extra-fine control enables the user to have a positional accuracy lesser than 1 √Ö. The sample is trapped by two molecularly smooth surfaces of mica in which it perfectly adheres epitaxially. Normal forces can be measured by a simple relation: F_{normal}(D)=k(\\\\Delta D_{applied}-\\\\Delta D_{measured}) where \\\\Delta D_{applied} is the applied displacement by using one of the control methods mentioned before, k is the spring constant and \\\\Delta D_{measured} is the actual deformation of the sample measured by MBI. Moreover, if {\\\\partial F(D)\\\\over\\\\partial D}>k then there is a mechanical instability and therefore the lower surface will jump to a more stable region of the upper surface. And so, the adhesion force is measured with the following formula: F_{adhesion}=k\\\\Delta D_{jump}. Using the DMT model, the interaction energy per unit area can be calculated: W_{flat}(D)={F_{curved}(D)\\\\over 2\\\\pi R} where R is the curvature radius and F_{curved}(D) is the force between cylyndrically curved surfaces. = Scanning probe microscopy = SPM techniques such as AFM and STM are widely used in nanotribology studies. The Scanning Tunneling Microscope is used mostly for morphological topological investigation of a clean conductive sample, because it is able to give an image of its surface with atomic resolution. The Atomic Force Microscope is a powerful tool in order to study tribology at a fundamental level. It provides an ultra-fine surface-tip contact with a high refined control over motion and atomic-level precision of measure. The microscope consists, basically, in a high flexible cantilever with a sharp tip, which is the part in contact with the sample and therefore the crossing section must be ideally atomic-size, but actually nanometric (radius of the section varies from 10 to 100 nm). In nanotribology AFM is commonly used for measuring normal and friction forces with a resolution of pico-Newtons. The tip is brought close to the sample's surface, consequently forces between the last atoms of the tip and the sample's deflect the cantilever proportionally to the intensity of this interactions. Normal forces bend the cantilever vertically up or down of the equilibrium position, depending on the sign of the force. The normal force can be calculated by means of the following equation: F_{normal}=k\\\\Delta V/\\\\sigma where k is the spring constant of the cantilever, \\\\Delta V is the output of the photodetector, which is an electric signal, directly with the displacement of the cantilever and \\\\sigma is the optical-lever sensitivity of the AFM. On the other hand, lateral forces can be measured with the FFM, which is fundamentally very similar to the AFM. The main difference resides in the tip motion, that slides perpendicularly to its axis. These lateral forces, i.e. friction forces in this case, result in twisting the cantilever, which is controlled to ensure that only the tip touches the surface and not other parts of the probe. At every step the twist is measured and related with the frictional force with this formula: F_{frictional}={{\\\\Delta Vk_\\\\phi}\\\\over {2h_{eff}\\\\delta} } where \\\\Delta V is the output voltage, k_{\\\\phi} is the torsional constant of the cantilever, h_{eff} is the height of the tip plus the cantilever thickness and \\\\delta is the lateral deflection sensitivity. Since the tip is part of a compliant apparatus, the cantilever, the load can be specified and so the measurement is made in load-control mode; but in this way the cantilever has snap-in and snap-out instabilities and so in some regions measurements cannot be completed stably. These instabilities can be avoided with displacement-controlled techniques, one of this is the interfacial force microscopy. The tap can be at contact with the sample in the whole measurement process, and this is called contact mode (or static mode), otherwise it can be oscillated and this is called tapping mode (or dynamic mode). Contact mode is commonly applied on hard sample, on which the tip cannot leave any sign of wear, such as scars and debris. For softer materials tapping mode is used to minimize the effects of friction. In this case the tip is vibrated by a piezo and taps the surface at the resonant frequency of the cantilever, i.e. 70-400 kHz, and with an amplitude of 20-100 nm, high enough to allow the tip to not get stuck to the sample because of the adhesion force. The atomic force microscope can be used as a nanoindenter in order to measure hardness and Young's modulus of the sample. For this application, the tip is made of diamond and it is pressed against the surface for about two seconds, then the procedure is repeated with different loads. The hardness is obtained dividing the maximum load by the residual imprint of the indenter, which can be different from the indenter section because of sink-in or pile-up phenomena. The Young's modulus can be calculated using the Oliver and Pharr method, which allows to obtain a relation between the stiffness of the sample, function of the indentation area, and its Young's and Poisson's moduli. = Atomistic simulations = Computational methods are particularly useful in nanotribology for studying various phenomena, such as nanoindentation, friction, wear or lubrication. In an atomistic simulation, every single atom's motion and trajectory can be tracked with a very high precision and so this information can be related to experimental results, in order to interpret them, to confirm a theory or to have access to phenomena, that are invisible to a direct study. Moreover, many experimental difficulties do not exist in an atomistic simulation, such as sample preparation and instrument calibration. Theoretically every surface can be created from a flawless one to the most disordered. As well as in the other fields where atomistic simulations are used, the main limitations of these techniques relies on the lack of accurate interatomic potentials and the limited computing power. For this reason, simulation time is very often small (femtoseconds) and the time step is limited to 1 fs for fundamental simulations up to 5 fs for coarse-grained models. It has been demonstrated with an atomistic simulation that the attraction force between the tip and sample's surface in a SPM measurement produces a jump-to-contact effect. This phenomenon has a completely different origin from the snap-in that occurs in load-controlled AFM, because this latter is originated from the finite compliance of the cantilever. The origin of the atomic resolution of an AFM was discovered and it has been shown that covalent bonds form between the tip and the sample which dominate van der Waals interactions and they are responsible for a such high resolution. Simulating an AFM scansion in contact mode, It has been found that a vacancy or an adatom can be detected only by an atomically sharp tip. Whether in non- contact mode vacancies and adatoms can be distinguished with the so-called frequency modulation technique with a non-atomically sharp tip. In conclusion only in non-contact mode can be achieved atomic resolution with an AFM.  Properties  = Friction = Friction, the force opposing to the relative motion, is usually idealized by means of some empirical laws such as Amonton‚Äôs First and Second laws and Coulomb's law. At the nanoscale, however, such laws may lose their validity. For instance, Amonton's second law states that friction coefficient is independent from the area of contact. Surfaces, in general, have asperities, that reduce the real area of contact and therefore, minimizing such area can minimize friction. During the scanning process with an AFM or FFM, the tip, sliding on the sample's surface, passes through both low (stable) and high potential energy points, determined, for instance, by atomic positions or, on a larger scale, by surface roughness. Without considering thermal effects, the only force that makes the tip overcome these potential barriers is the spring force given by the support: this causes the stick-slip motion. At the nanoscale, friction coefficient depends on several conditions. For example, with light loading conditions, tend to be lower than those at the macroscale. With higher loading conditions, such coefficient tends to be similar to the macroscopic one. Temperature and relative motion speed can also affect friction. = Lubricity and superlubricity at the atomic scale = Lubrication is the technique used to reduce friction between two surfaces in mutual contact. Generally, lubricants are fluids introduced between these surfaces in order to reduce friction. However, in micro- or nano-devices, lubrication is often required and traditional lubricants become too viscous when confined in layers of molecular thickness. A more effective technique is based on thin films, commonly produced by Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, or self-assembled monolayers Thin films and self-assembled monolayers are also used to increase adhesion phenomena. Two thin films made of perfluorinated lubricants (PFPE) with different chemical composition were found to have opposite behaviors in humid environment: hydrophobicity increases the adhesive force and decreases lubrication of films with nonpolar end groups; instead, hydrophilicity has the opposite effects with polar end groups.  Superlubricity  ‚ÄúSuperlubricity is a frictionless tribological state sometimes occurring in nanoscale material junctions‚Äù. At the nanoscale, friction tends to be non isotropic: if two surfaces sliding against each other have incommensurate surface lattice structures, each atom is subject to different amount of force from different directions . Forces, in this situation, can offset each other, resulting in almost zero friction. The very first proof of this was obtained using a UHV-STM to measure. If lattices are incommensurable, friction was not observed, however, if the surfaces are commensurable, friction force is present. At the atomic level, these tribological properties are directly connected with superlubricity. An example of this is given by solid lubricants, such as graphite, MoS2 and Ti3SiC2: this can be explained with the low resistance to shear between layers due to the stratified structure of these solids. Even if at the macroscopic scale friction involves multiple microcontacts with different size and orientation, basing on these experiments one can speculate that a large fraction of contacts will be in superlubric regime. This leads to a great reduction in average friction force, explaining why such solids have a lubricant effect. Other experiments carried out with the LFM shows that the stick-slip regime is not visible if the applied normal load is negative: the sliding of the tip is smooth and the average friction force seems to be zero. Other mechanisms of superlubricity may include: (a) Thermodynamic repulsion due to a layer of free or grafted macromolecules between the bodies so that the entropy of the intermediate layer decreases at small distances due to stronger confinement; (b) Electrical repulsion due to external electrical voltage; (c) Repulsion due to electrical double layer; (d) Repulsion due to thermal fluctuations.  Thermolubricity at the atomic scale  With the introduction of AFM and FFM, thermal effects on lubricity at the atomic scale could not be considered negligible any more. Thermal excitation can result in multiple jumps of the tip in the direction of the slide and backward. When the sliding velocity is low, the tip takes a long time to move between low potential energy points and thermal motion can cause it to make a lot of spontaneous forward and reverse jumps: therefore, the required lateral force to make the tip follow the slow support motion is small, so the friction force becomes very low. For this situation was introduced the term thermolubricity. = Adhesion = Adhesion is the tendency of two surfaces to stay attached together. The attention in studying adhesion at the micro- and nanoscale increased with the development of AFM: it can be used in nanoindentation experiments, in order to quantify adhesion forces According to these studies, hardness was found to be constant with film thickness, and it's given by: H=\\\\frac{P_c}{A_c} where A_c is the indentation's area and P_c is the load applied to the indenter. Stiffness, defined as S=\\\\frac{dP}{dh} , where h is the indentation's depth, can be obtained from r_c , the radius of the indenter-contact line. S=2\\\\cdot E'\\\\cdot r_c \\\\frac{1}{E'}= \\\\frac{1- u_i^2}{E_i}+\\\\frac{1- u_s^2}{E_s} E' is the reduced Young's modulus, E_i and u_i are the indenter's Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio and E_s , u_s are the same parameters for the sample. However, r_c can't always be determined from direct observation; it could be deduced from the value of h_c (depth of indentation), but it's possible only if there is no sink-in or pile-up (perfect Sneddon's surface conditions). If there is sink in, for example, and the indenter is conical the situation is described below. thumb206x206pxDisplacement of the tip ( h), elastic displacement of sample surface at the contact line with the indenter ( he), contact depth (hc), contact radius (rc) and cone angle (Œ±) of the indenter are shown. From the image, we can see that: h=h_c+h_e and r_c=h_c\\\\cdot\\\\tan\\\\alpha From Oliver and Pharr's study h_e=\\\\epsilon\\\\cdot h where Œµ depends on the geometry of the indenter; \\\\epsilon=1-\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} if it's conical, \\\\epsilon=\\\\frac{1}{2} if it's spherical and \\\\epsilon=1 if it's a flat cylinder. Oliver and Pharr, therefore, did not consider adhesive force, but only elastic force, so they concluded: F_e=\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}\\\\cdot E' \\\\cdot \\\\tan\\\\alpha \\\\cdot (h-h_f)^2 Considering adhesive force P=F_e+F_a Introducing W_a as the adhesion energy and \\\\gamma_a as the work of adhesion: W_a=\\\\frac{-\\\\gamma_a\\\\cdot4\\\\cdot\\\\tan\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi\\\\cdot\\\\cos\\\\alpha}\\\\cdot h_c^2 obtaining F_a=- \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_a\\\\cdot 8 \\\\tan\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi\\\\cdot \\\\cos\\\\alpha}\\\\cdot (h-h_f) In conclusion: P(h)=\\\\frac{2E'\\\\cdot \\\\tan\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\cdot(h-h_f)^2- \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_a\\\\cdot 8 \\\\tan\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi\\\\cdot \\\\cos\\\\alpha}\\\\cdot (h-h_f) The consequences of the additional term of adhesion is visible in the following graph: Load-displacement curves that shows the effect of adhesion force During loading, indentation depth is higher when adhesion is not negligible: adhesion forces contributes to the work of indentation; on the other hand, during unloading process, adhesion forces opposes indentation process. Adhesion is also related to capillary forces acting between two surfaces when in presence of humidity.  Applications of adhesion studies  This phenomenon is very important in thin films, because a mismatch between the film and the surface can cause internal stresses and, consequently interface debonding. When a normal load is applied with an indenter, the film deforms plastically, until the load reaches a critical value: an interfacial fracture starts to develop. The crack propagates radially, until the film is buckled. On the other hand, adhesion was also investigated for its biomimetic applications: several creatures including insects, spiders, lizards and geckos have developed a unique climbing ability that are trying to be replicated in synthetic materials . It was shown that a multi-level hierarchical structure produces adhesion enhancement: a synthetic adhesive replicating gecko feet organization was created using nanofabrication techniques and self-assembly. = Wear = Wear is related to the removal and the deformation of a material caused by the mechanical actions. At the nanoscale, wear is not uniform. The mechanism of wear generally begins on the surface of material. The relative motion of two surfaces can cause indentations obtained by the removal and deformation of surface material. Continued motion can eventually grow in both width and depth these indentations. At the macro scale wear is measured by quantifying the volume (or mass) of material loss or by measuring the ratio of wear volume per energy dissipated. At the nanoscale, however, measuring such volume can be difficult and therefore, it is possible to use evaluate wear by analyzing modifications in surface topology, generally by means of AFM scanning.

The building is known for having one of the largest four-faced clocks in the world. Clock Tower =History= The Allen- Bradley Clock Tower, owned by Allen-Bradley, a product brand of Rockwell Automation, has long been a landmark in Milwaukee. According to the Guinness Book of World Records: \\"The largest four-faced clock is that on the research and office addition of the Allen-Bradley Company. Each face has a diameter of 40 feet, 3-1/2 inches. Dedicated on October 31, 1962, it rises 280 feet from the streets of Milwaukee, and requires 34.6 kilowatts of electricity for lighting and power.\\" It has since been surpassed by the 141 foot clock faces of the Abraj Al Bait. The original plan for the clock tower date as far back as 1959, when it appears on early drawings for the proposed addition. Created by architect Fitzhugh Scott, the plans included several towers in its design, only one of which would house a clock. This was scaled back, however a smaller tower on an existing building was kept and modified to display the outdoor temperature using a large digital display. The interest in creating the tower was Harry Bradley, younger of the firm's two founding brothers. An inventor, Bradley including in his tinkering several of the clocks which he owned. The clock has been called \\"The Polish Moon,\\" referring to the historically Polish neighborhood in which it is based (see St. Stanislaus Catholic Church history). In recent years it has also been called the \\"Mexican Moon,\\" reflecting the change in the area's ethnic composition (though both ethnicities have presences). Its lighted faces have been used as a navigation aid for Lake Michigan mariners over the years, except during the 1973 oil crisis when the clock was unlit from November 1973 to June 1974. =Clock size= The current clock tower stands at . Because the octagonal faces are nearly twice the size of the faces of London's Big Ben, chimes were never added in an attempt to allow Big Ben to remain the largest four-faced chiming clock in the world. In fact, that title has belonged to the Minneapolis City Hall clock since 1909. Each hour hand of the Allen-Bradley Clock Tower is long and weighs 490 pounds (220 kg). Each minute hand is 20 feet (6.1 m) long and weighs 550 pounds (240 kg). The hour markings are high. =Appearance in popular culture= The tower made an appearance on the NASCAR Busch Series race car of Mike Bliss in 2004. To celebrate Rockwell Automation and Allen- Bradley's 100-year association, the #20 Rockwell Automation car was painted black with gold accents, along with the Rockwell/Allen-Bradley 100 Years symbol on the hood and quarter panels. The Clock Tower was depicted on the car in front of the wheel well.

The river's headwaters are in Columbiaville in Lapeer County and flows through the counties of Lapeer, Genesee, and Saginaw. The cities of Lapeer, Flint, Flushing, and Montrose are along its course.  Name  The river's name is a translation from the Ojibwe language Biiwaanagoonh-ziibi (Flinty River).Rhodes, Richard A. 1985. \\"biiwaan'goonh-ziibi\\" in Eastern Ojibwa-Chippewa-Ottawa Dictionary. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter. For a time, an Indian Reservation named Pewonigowink (Biiwaanagoonying: By the Flinty [River]) existed near Genesee, Michigan.Wood, Edwin O. 1916. \\"Chapter III: The Tribal Reservation\\" in History of Genesee County, Michigan, Her People, Industries and Institutions. Michigan Historical Commission. Retrieved on May 22, 2013  Course  The Flint River drains of Michigan, in Lapeer, Genesee, Shiawassee, Saginaw, Oakland, Tuscola, and Sanilac counties. The river forms in Lapeer County near Columbiaville where the river's South Branch and North Branch come together. Its volume is supplemented by numerous creeks, including: Kearsley Creek, Thread Creek and Swartz Creek in Genesee County, and Misteguay Creek in Saginaw County. The river flows in a southwesterly direction past Flint before turning northward near Flushing. It empties into the Shiawassee River in the Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge near the city of Saginaw, as do the Bad River and Cass River. The Shiawassee then converges with the Tittabawassee River to form the Saginaw River. The Saginaw empties into the Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron.  Features along the Flint River  The river is dammed in Richfield Township to form the Holloway Reservoir, which was formed in 1953 and fully completed 1955. The reservoir was constructed, originally, as a water supply for Flint, and to move the river through the city more quickly to dilute sewage.Holloway Reservoir, Genesee & Lapeer counties (T8N, R8, 9E, Section Many), by William C. Bryant, Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Status of the Fishery Resource Report 92-1, 1992. By 1967, though, the city purchased its drinking water from the City of Detroit, via a pipeline from Lake Huron, and only used the reservoir as an emergency back-up water supply. The C.S. Mott Dam just downstream and west of Genesee forms C S Mott Lake and was completed in 1972 for recreational use. Local attractions along the lake include Crossroads Village (home of the Huckleberry Railroad), Stepping Stone Falls, and the riverboat Genesee Belle. The next dam is the Utah Dam. A largely steel dam, it was completed in 1928 to prevent industrial discharges from entering the drinking water supply downstream. The gates have since been locked in the open position so that it no longer impedes the flow of the river. The Hamilton Dam exists downstream at the University of Michigan‚ÄìFlint campus in downtown Flint. Constructed in 1920, it once also served as a pedestrian bridge, but is now in severe disrepair. Because of its dilapidation, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ordered that steps be taken by 2008, and if that did not occur that the river be lowered to reduce the use of the dam.John Foren, Flint's Hamilton Dam under the microscope for repairs, Flint Journal via MLive (February 22, 2008). In 2008, the city of Flint spent $30,000 on a pre- engineering study to assess whether a new dam was needed or the old one be repaired. Finally, downstream from the Hamilton Dam is an inflatable dam just west of the Grand Traverse Street Bridge. The Fabridam was completed in 1979 mostly for visual and recreational purposes as it impounds very little of the river. It was replaced in 2001 with a $604,000 Obermeyer Hydro Inc. dam. In the city of Flint, the river flows past the sites of several former General Motors factories, most notably Chevrolet's first assembly plant, which was bisected by the river, and downtown through the campus of the University of Michigan‚ÄìFlint and Riverbank Park. Also along the river front is the Flint Carriage Factory site, later Dort Motors. The Durant-Dort Carriage Company Office, now a historic landmark, is across the street. Continuing downstream, the river runs past Kettering University and McLaren Hospital, then into Flint Township and through Flushing. The stretch of the Flint River from downtown Flint to Kettering University is channelized with concrete sides. A recreational trail called the Flint River Trail runs along the river from Grand Traverse Street in downtown Flint to Carpenter Road on one side and Johnson Elementary School on Pierson Road on the other. It is a paved path, except behind the Flint water plant. North of Carpenter Road, the trail connects to the Mott Lake Trailway, which goes to Bluebell Beach on Bray Road and Stepping Stone Falls on Branch Road in Genesee Township. Another portion of the Mott Lake Trailway runs alongside the lake from the corner of Center Road and Coldwater Road to the corner of Genesee Road and Stanley Road. Together, the trails run . An organization named Friends of the Flint River Trail maintains it, in addition to the Genesee County Parks & Recreation Commission and Flint Parks & Recreation Department. Wildlife, conservation, and pollution The river has suffered from decades upon decades of industrial pollution,John Wisely & Robin Erb, Chemical testing could have predicted Flint's water crisis, Detroit Free Press (October 11, 2015). although cleanups following the Clean Water Act have vastly improved pollution since the 1950s and 1960s.The Flint: A good river with a bad reputation, Charles Stewart Mott Foundation (December 2, 2015).Scott Atkinson, The Flint River isn't what you think it is, and here's why you should check it out, MLive (August 11, 2014). The river has the same fishing advisory as the Great Lakes. Fish in the river include smallmouth bass, walleye, and some trout. The water in the Flint River has high levels of chlorides (thought to be the result of, in part, road salt), making it highly corrosive to lead pipes. Chlorides do not pose a direct threat to fish, wildlife, or humans, but cause problems because they corrode lead and other metals in piping and plumbing. =Flint water crisis= In April 2014, reacting to years of cost increases in water purchased from Detroit, the City of Flint voted to join a new water project bringing Lake Huron water directly to Flint by 2016. When the decision was announced, Detroit invoked a termination clause in the contract cutting Flint off from Detroit water in one year. Flint and Detroit negotiated to maintain the connection to the Detroit system but ultimately the decision was made to switch its water source from Detroit back to water from the Flint River. Almost immediately, residents began complaining about the water's taste and appearance, saying it was cloudy and emitted a foul odor. The city issued a notice informing Flint residents of their water containing unlawful levels of trihalomethanes, a chlorine byproduct linked to cancer and other diseases. The Hurley Medical Center, in Flint, released a study in September 2015, which stated the proportion of infants and children with high concentrations of lead in their blood had nearly doubled since the city switched its water source. Tests showed after water left Flint's treatment plant, it was lead free, but by the time it reached the tap, it sometimes had elevated levels of lead. This happened because the Flint River water was more corrosive to lead pipes than the previously used water source, Lake Huron; a study conducted by Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards, a leading authority on water quality, showed that the Flint River water corroded lead pipes at 19 times the rate of water piped from Detroit.

It was one of the first PlayStation 2 games made with CD-ROM-based technology. Ring of Red was released in 2000 for Japan followed by North America and Europe in 2001. An emulated version for the PlayStation 3 was released as a PS2 Classic on October 4, 2011 in North America. The game is based on an alternate history theory that after the defeat of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy near the end of World War II, Japan was conquered and occupied by both Soviet and American forces - rather than solely by the US, as in actual history. The occupation created two countries, consisting of the north governed by a pro-communist government and the south by a pro-democracy government with Hokkaid≈ç occupied by Soviet forces. Tensions between the two Japan's were at an all-time high during the Cold War with a Japanese War (similar in cause to the actual Korean War) taking place with Armored Fighting Walkers, giant walking mechas being used with great success by both the North and South Japanese militaries. Gameplay Combat is split between a turn-based battlefield for moving units, and a real-time mode for combat. The latter includes the AFWs moving through their attack patterns and support troops that have their own abilities. =Tactical map= The tactical map uses a square grid. In each mission, players deploy their units on a map. Each square contains terrain that provide movement and defense bonuses or penalties. Both sides consist of units made up of a single AFW and three squads of infantry. The player and the enemy take turns in moving their units around the map in order to complete certain objectives, such as pursuing a unit, capturing a town or protecting a convoy. Some missions have branching objectives that give different bonuses. Players can engage in combat by moving within distance of an enemy unit, depending on the range the AFW is in prior to combat. If players are successful in destroying the enemy AFW, the enemy unit is removed from the map and players gain experience points. If the enemy destroys a player AFW, the entire unit is removed until the next mission. In addition to combat, players can capture cities, which can provide more troops for recruitment and heal friendly troops, and can dedicate turns to repairing their units. Each mission has parameters which result in player defeat, such as not completing the mission within the time limit or losing Weizegger's AFW. Ring of Red features a day/night cycle. Each move takes a certain amount of time, which influences how often units can be issued orders, which in turn affects what time of day combat takes place. In addition, there is simulated weather and natural disasters. =Combat= When engaging enemies, a 1st Person view of the scope's reticule appears in order to facilitate attacks. In this case, Ryoko's AFW is on target as a mock enemy during Mission 2 with Masami's Aim Weapon Maximum Attack. Combat takes place in a real-time environment. Players begin with their AFW standing in opposition to the enemy AFW. If either AFW is destroyed, combat ends and the unit is removed from the strategic map. If neither AFW is destroyed within the prescribed time limit, the battle ends in a draw. Units can also end combat by escaping from the battlefield or by engaging in close combat, which automatically ends the match. Combat consists of players moving and operating their AFW and issuing orders to accompanying infantry. AFWs must wait until their main weapon is loaded before they can attack, either against the enemy AFW itself or its infantry support. When aiming, players are given a first-person view from the AFW along with a hit probability percentage. The more time spent aiming, the more accurate the shot becomes and the more damage is done. Base accuracy is dependent on range, battle conditions, and type of AFW, although the rate of increase of accuracy slows down as it increases. Conditions on the strategic map strongly influence the battle conditions. Battles fought at night receive a penalty in base accuracy. Different types of terrain grant different bonuses and penalties to base accuracy. Furthermore, various terrains can also block attacks randomly, such as trees in forests. Certain support troops can compensate for terrain conditions by deploying range-finders before the battle starts, and Afws, in tandem with squadrons stationed on the mech itself, can launch flares to provide Battlefield illumination. Players also have access to Maximum Attacks, which are unique abilities that can only be used a certain number of times in each mission. Maximum Attacks vary between pilots, but include techniques such as powerful shots, unaimed snap-shots, dodging, instant movement and instant loading. Some crews also provide special shells which can provide illumination or do devastating damage against AFWs or infantry. =Infantry= Three infantry squads accompany the AFW in each unit, two fighting on the ground and the third riding on the mech itself as crew. Some squad types, such as the Mechanic or Medic, provide bonuses to healing units between turns, while Recon units allow the AFW to start combat at the optimum distance for the range the engagement begins at. During the combat turn, squads fight automatically, aiming at either the soldiers in the enemy unit or the enemy AFW, depending on their designation (Anti-Infantry or Anti- AFW). Each squad has a different ability that is used in the Vanguard (deployed in front of the mech) or Rearguard (deployed behind it). These can range from special attacks against the enemy AFW or infantry, fixing damaged portions of their own machine, or defending against attacks. Plot An anti- AFW at the rear while German troops march in the countryside. The said AFW was placed on actual World War II combat footage by CGI with black and white rendering to give it an authentic feeling of the footage being taken in the late 1930s and 1940s. =Setting= Ring of Red is set in an alternate history 1960s where the Allies ended World War II by invading Japan in the costly Operation Downfall rather than the use of the atomic bomb. With the Cold War looming over the horizon, Hokkaid≈ç is ceded to the Soviet Union, and the remaining portions Japan are partitioned into Communist Republic of North Japan and democratic South Japan. North Japan was supported by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, while the United States and other democratic countries supported the South, and Germany makes engineering contributions to both sides. In 1950, like the Korean War, the Japan War took place when communist-backed North Japan invaded the south. The north and the south fought for three years in which South Japan, with the help of its Western Allies, repelled the invasion but neither side was able to gain the upper hand. The war finally ended in 1953 in a stalemate mainly dictated to both Japans by both super powers. The Vietnam War by comparison is extremely brief and ends in a swift victory for North Vietnam. A significant development in this timeline is the design and deployment of mecha called Armoured Fighting Walkers (AFWs). They were used with negligible effect in the European theatre of war after Hitler ordered their deployment at the Battle of Kursk, however they proved more effective in the rugged terrain of Japan and other countries. The establishment of a no fly zone over Japan under the RACINI Treaty - based on the presumption that nuclear weapons could only be delivered by airplane - has furthered AFW development. However, this treaty does not prevent the use of nuclear weapons by AFWs or ballistic missiles should one of the sides decide to develop such weapons. When the Type 3 prototype AFW is stolen by elite Northern agent and Vietnam veteran Yu Kaiho under the orders of the North Japanese general Hidetomi Minakawa, Masami \\"Wei\\" von Weizegger and Ryoko Minakawa were sent to retrieve the prototype for South Japan at all costs. In their quest to retrieve it, they will learn there are bigger ambitions at play than tipping the balance of the Cold War, and even their own allies may not be trusted. Plot differences In the Japanese version, it is stated that Wei and Ryoko's commanding officers Schreingen and Rodriguez are former members of the Nazi Party but evaded punishment in return for information regarding AFWs and allowed to stay in South Japan. There are no references to this in the EU and US versions. The Japanese version also mentions the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki being followed up by Operation Downfall. Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot said the game \\"is easily the best strategy game out on the PS2 at this time.\\" IGN criticized the dialogue and the overall translation, but praised the game as \\"a very satisfying strategy experience.\\" GameRevolution criticized the pace of the gameplay and the graphics, while praising its simplicity and depth. Eurogamer criticized the soundtrack, lack of voice acting and translation, but praised the graphics and gameplay, saying \\"People who enjoy involving battle strategy romps...will definitely find Ring of Red captivating.\\" GamePro called it \\"repetitive and sometimes even boring...yet it manages to be hypnotically fun.\\" Greg Orlando of Next Generation said, \\"With this Ring, we certainly are wed to mass destruction ‚Äì yet we marry not out of love, but for looks and quick, easy fun.\\" However, the game was criticized for having many errors in its localization, such as misspelling, factual errors and incoherent dialogue. Ring of Red was also faulted for not having any voice acting.

In July 2017, it was announced that British American Tobacco would be phasing out sales of its Viceroy Red cigarettes in Argentina and replace them with Rothmans, according to an M-Brain story relayed by the TMA. The story said that Argentina was the first Latin American country to which BAT had introduced Rothmans. Advertising 1957 Viceroy ad Brown & Williamson made various poster and magazine advertisements to promote the Viceroy brand. Various TV ads were also made to promote the brand from the 1950s to the 1970s. One of the most notable Viceroy advertisements, were the ones that advertised that, because Viceroy cigarettes were filter-tipped, less tar would manifest on and between the teeth, and would thus be a \\"healthier\\" alternative to other brands. A slogan used in the 1940s ads at the time was \\"As your dentist, I would recommend Viceroys\\". In the 1970s, Brown & Williamson realised that the cigarette brand was mainly smoked by women and couples because the Viceroy brand was \\"less masculine than its key competition\\" and the brand had a \\"feminine orientation\\" according to internal documents. From the early 1970s onwards, B&W; started to sponsor the brand via the Vel's Parnelli Jones Racing team in autosport championships such as the United States Auto Club and Formula 1 to give the brand a more \\"masculine\\" additude, similar to Marlboro. In 1974, Viceroy partnered with TAG Heuer and produced a special version of the black-dialed Autavia (a watch introduced in 1933) that was offered for US$88. This version of the Autavia was called the \\"Viceroy\\" and advertisements for this promotion featured racer Parnelli Jones. Various adverts were made to promote both the cigarette brand and the Autavia watch. Controversy =Encouraging children to smoke= An old pack of Viceroy cigarettes with a Romanian text warning which reads \\"Smoking seriously harms you and those around you\\" In the 1970s, Viceroy was proposed as part of a B&W; marketing test to see whether children could be encouraged to become smokers. This was discovered by the Federal Trade Commission during a closed investigation of cigarette company advertising practices. The Viceroy ad campaign was not carried out. =Genetically modified tobacco used in Viceroys= The Viceroy brand was involved in public controversy beginning in 1994 when U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Aaron Kessler revealed that B&W; had been found growing genetically modified tobacco plants in South America, the plants engineered to produce increased levels of nicotine. Viceroy King Size and Viceroy Lights King Size cigarettes made in 1993 were identified as some of the B&W; brands carrying \\"approximately 10% of this genetically bred high-nicotine tobacco called Y-1,\\" referring to Y1 tobacco. =Adding chemicals to increase addiction= Further controversy came in 1995 when former B&W; vice president Jeffrey Wigand, a research chemist, revealed that B&W; had been adding chemicals to the B&W; cigarette brands Kool, Capri and Viceroy to increase smokers' addiction to nicotine. Sponsorship =USAC/IndyCar= Viceroy sponsored the Vel's Parnelli Jones Racing team in the USAC Car Championship in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. =Formula 1= Viceroy sponsored the Vel's Parnelli Jones Racing team in the and seasons. =Football= Viceroy was a sponsor of the Hong Kong Viceroy Cup which was held from 1969 until 1998. In popular culture There is a packet of Viceroy cigarettes on the table in 12 Angry Men (1957 film). =Music= Canadian singer-songwriter Mac DeMarco made a song called \\"Ode to Viceroy\\", a tribute to his favorite brand of cigarettes. The song was recorded on his album 2 in June 2012 and was released in October 2012. In an interview on Thrasher Magazine, Mac said about the song: > A lot of people don't even understand that that's a reference to cigarettes > because that brand doesn't exist in a lot of places in the world. It used to > be a big American cigarette brand. ... The idea of the song isn't, like, try > cigarettes! It's more, like, I have an addiction! In Canada all of the > cigarettes are really, really moderated by the government so they wouldn't > do anything and that's a good thing. Markets Viceroy cigarettes were or still are sold in the following countries: United States, Canada, Mexico, Honduras, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Chile, Argentina, United Kingdom, Finland, West Germany, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Belarus, Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Egypt, Israel, Thailand, Hong Kong, Lebanon and Singapore.

He learned music from his father (who also played the nai, the Romanian pan pipe, in a band (taraf) of LƒÉutari) and brothers. FƒÉnicƒÉ Luca himself would also play in such orchestras, developing great skills and gaining a reputation as a pan pipe virtuoso. In the 19th century the nai - originally an instrument of the lƒÉutari with only 8 to 10 pipes, covering a little more than one octave - had been extended to about 20 pipes, giving far greater possibilities to a solo performer. Remarkable is the fact that FƒÉnicƒÉ Luca never learned reading musical scores, he always played by the ear. In 1910, at age 16, he made his first international concert tour, during which he spent some months in ƒ∞zmir, Turkey. Between 1920 and 1929 he regularly played in the best restaurants of Bucharest and his fame spread all over Romania. In 1929 he performed in Warsaw and Paris. It was his concerts at the Universal Exhibition of Paris (1937) which gave the pan pipe its first popularity in the West. In 1937 FƒÉnicƒÉ Luca received the \\"Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques\\" from the French Ministry of National Education. He also performed at the New York World's Fair in 1939.

The eighth episode of the seventh season. This explores the relationship between two cultures on an exoplanet and between Crusher and Picard. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, Captain Picard and Dr. Crusher escape imprisonment on an alien world then discover that their thoughts are connected by brain implants. Plot Captain Picard and Dr. Crusher prepare to look into a diplomatic request from the Kes, one of the planet Kesprytt's two societies, who want entrance into the Federation. This is unprecedented because the planet's other society, the Prytt, wish no contact with the Federation or anyone else. Worf attempts to transport Crusher and Picard to the Kes, but they end up in a Prytt prison cell, where strange electronic devices are implanted in their necks. Minister Lorin of the Prytt informs Picard and Crusher that they are being held because of suspected conspiracy with the Kes and that the devices in their necks will reveal the truth. Back aboard the Enterprise, Riker sets up a meeting with Kes Ambassador Mauric to address the abduction. Meanwhile, Beverly mysteriously receives her tricorder hidden in a tray of food. She notices that a map has been added to her directory and, sensing it may come from the Kes, she and Picard use it to escape. Riker, Worf, and Deanna Troi meet with Ambassador Mauric, who tells them that since they have no formal relations with the Prytt, their best option is to insert a rescue team into the Prytt capital city. Meanwhile, Picard and Crusher follow the tricorder map through a maze of caverns where fireballs explode around them. The Enterprise is contacted by Lorin, who refuses to discuss Picard and Crusher and threatens an attack if Riker does not cease communications with her people. Even though Worf's analysis shows that the Prytt weapons are no danger to the Enterprise, Riker is at a loss until Mauric informs him that Picard and Crusher have been released by a Kes operative and are on their way to the Kes border. Meanwhile, Picard and Crusher realize that the implants in their necks allow them to read each other's thoughts ‚Äî whether they want to or not. When they separate to regain privacy, both are hit with nausea that renders them incapable of being apart. When two Prytt troopers appear in their path, they backtrack to ensure their safety. Mauric learns that the pair have not arrived at their destination and summons Riker and Worf to accuse them of conspiring with the Prytt. Riker assures him that this is not the case, but Mauric insists on leaving the Enterprise. Later, Picard and Crusher stop to rest for the night. Still able to hear each other's thoughts, they realize that there is not only a strong attraction between them ‚Äî but Picard was once in love with Crusher but suppressed his feelings because of his friendship with her late husband Jack, and then later due to guilt over Jack's death under his command. Determined to prove Mauric wrong and save his crew mates, Riker transports Lorin aboard the starship against her will. He sits down with Mauric and Lorin, but neither seems to care about Picard or Crusher. Disgusted, Riker tells Mauric that, based on what he has seen, the Kes will be denied entrance into the Federation. He then tells Lorin that if anything happens to Picard and/or Crusher, the Prytt will be inundated by a flood of information requests from Starfleet investigators. At that moment, Picard and Crusher arrive at the Kes border and, while Picard gets across, Crusher is caught by Prytt security forces. Her captors hail Lorin, who orders Crusher and Picard returned to the Enterprise. Safe at home, Picard and Crusher have the implants removed and share a dinner without reading each other's minds. Picard suggests that they should not be afraid to explore their feelings for one another. Crusher kisses Picard but then tells him perhaps they should be more afraid and hints that they should go slowly. They bid each other goodnight, and Crusher leaves Picard's quarters. Picard blows out the candles in his stateroom and stares into space, wrestling with his mixed emotions over Dr. Crusher's rejection. Arc narrative In the finale (\\"All Good Things...\\") it is revealed Picard and Crusher get married in the future, and Crusher becomes captain of a science starship. Reception In 2017, CBR ranked Picard and Beverly the number one best romantic relationship of all Star Trek. In 2018, Tom's Guide rated \\"Attached\\" one of the 15 best episodes featuring Picard.

Released in October 1981, it followed the twin commercial failures of Ringo the 4th (1977) and Bad Boy (1978). The album includes the hit single \\"Wrack My Brain\\", written and produced by George Harrison, but otherwise failed to find commercial success. It also includes contributions from Paul McCartney, Harry Nilsson, Ronnie Wood and Stephen Stills. The album began life in mid 1980 as Can't Fight Lightning, while Starr was signed to Portrait Records. After the label withdrew its support, the project lay dormant until he signed with the RCA subsidiary Boardwalk Records in 1981. John Lennon had been due to participate in the recording, having offered Starr the songs \\"Life Begins at 40\\" and \\"Nobody Told Me\\", but he was murdered in New York a month before the sessions were to have taken place. Stop and Smell the Roses was reissued in 1994 with six bonus tracks. Background and recording While visiting John Lennon at his Dakota apartment, Starr was given a demo of \\"Life Begins at 40\\" by Lennon. Lennon wrote the song specifically for Starr, and wanted him to record it for his next album. Soon after meeting soon-to-be second wife Barbara Bach on the film set of Caveman in early 1980, Ringo Starr met fellow former-Beatle Paul McCartney, and his wife, Linda, at a hotel while they had earlier visited the 33rd annual Cannes Film Festival, on 16 May. Starr asked McCartney whether he would like to play on and possibly produce Starr's next album, to which McCartney agreed. Starr started sessions in France for a new album, at this point titled Can't Fight Lightning, on 11 July, at Super Bear Studios, lasting until 21 July. With Wings then in limbo and McCartney II just released, McCartney booked time with Starr to record three songs: \\"Private Property\\" and \\"Attention\\" (both McCartney originals) plus a cover of \\"Sure to Fall\\". They also recorded the song \\"You Can't Fight Lightning\\", which Starr wrote after he and Bach were nearly struck by lightning. Following on from a brief holiday, Starr and Bach flew to Los Angeles on 27 July. Recording moved to Devonshire Sound Studio in Hollywood on 11 August. Next Stephen Stills got involved, writing \\"You've Got a Nice Way\\" for Starr and producing its recording that August. On 4 September the recording session moved again, this time to Cherokee Studios. Ronnie Wood of The Rolling Stones was keen to help out and brought with him the song \\"Dead Giveaway\\" on 23 September, which they co-produced. Two days later on the 25th, the pair taped the track \\"Brandy\\". Starr recorded alone on 27 September. On 6 November Starr and Wood demoed the song \\"I Don't Believe You\\". Long-time friend Harry Nilsson was next on Starr's checklist, presenting him with \\"Drumming Is My Madness\\" as well as the album's title track, both of which were recorded in early November, with early December sessions completing the work of the cork. Before returning home to England, Starr planned for another session to be held at the studio on 14 January. After working with McCartney, Starr also felt it appropriate to extend the invitation to his two other band mates in The Beatles; Upon his return to his Tittenhurst Park residence on 10 November, Starr phoned George Harrison, inviting him to appear on the album. When Starr arrived at Harrison's Friar Park estate on 19 November, Harrison presented him with \\"Wrack My Brain\\", which he had composed for Starr. \\"You Belong to Me\\", another cover from the past, was recorded, with Harrison producing. Starr also recorded a version of \\"All Those Years Ago\\", but Starr told Harrison the vocal was too high for his range and he didn't like the words. Lennon was the last of the former-Beatles that Starr had yet to visit and ‚Äì fresh from his musical re-awakening, having just released Double Fantasy ‚Äì Lennon was eager to meet with Starr. On 26 November, in New York City, Lennon handed Starr the demos for \\"Nobody Told Me\\". With Lennon producing, they set a date, the one Starr had originally booked, for 14 January 1981 to record the song. Starr and Bach flew from New York to Los Angeles, on 28 November. Back in Hollywood two days later, Starr, Nilsson and engineer Paul Travis listened to playbacks of the July sessions at Compass Point Studios. On 1 December, Starr laid down vocals for \\"You Can't Fight Lightning\\". For the next two days, Starr and Jarvis mixed the album. On 4 December, Starr added vocals to a re-make of \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\". The next day Starr flew to the Bahamas to be with Bach. On 8 December, Lennon was shot and killed. After a period of mourning, Starr returned to the studio on 14 January 1981. Harrison took the \\"All Those Years Ago\\" track, changed some of the lyrics and, with overdubs by Paul and Linda McCartney, it was released as a tribute to Lennon. Starr, with Wood recorded for 3 days from the 14th, at Cherokee Studios, with further final batch of sessions taking place from 20 January until 12 February. During this time, the tracks \\"Dead Giveaway\\", \\"Wake Up\\", \\"Brandy\\", \\"You Belong to Me\\" and \\"Wrack My Brain\\" were finished. On 13 February, final mixes of the tracks were made at Compass Point Studios and ten tracks were chosen for release on the album. Release and aftermath In April 1981, Starr left record label Portrait due to a disagreement with its distributor, CBS, who was due to release the Can't Fight Lightning version of the album. Starr would eventually sign to RCA Records (and a subsidiary called Boardwalk in the US), for a multi-album deal. At the Egham Aerodrome in Surrey, on 16 and 17 September, Starr filmed promo videos for the tracks \\"Wrack My Brain\\" and \\"Stop and Take the Time to Smell the Roses\\", both of which were directed by Keef & Co. On 18 September interior filming in London took place for \\"Wrack My Brain\\". The next day the promo for was edited for airing on TV. Over a month later, from 26 October until 12 December, Starr gave several interviews to help promote the album. Two days later, he appeared in a radio interview for WBEN, again, to promote the album. Harrison's \\"Wrack My Brain\\", backed with \\"Drumming Is My Madness\\", was the first single, released on 27 October, the same day as the album in the US by Boardwalk. In the UK, the single was released on 13 November by RCA. While it missed the UK charts, it managed to give Starr his final US Top 40 hit, reaching number 38. In South Africa, \\"Wrack My Brain\\" reached number 17. It also charted in Switzerland (#32) and did well in Belgium (#10). With a re-sequenced running order and design change, the album was rechristened Stop and Smell the Roses, after Nilsson's donated song. The album was released in the UK on 20 November. Another radio interview to promote the album was held on 2 December, by Capitol Radio in Los Angeles. Stop and Smell the Roses reached no further than number 98 in the US. On 31 December, the HMV store in London announced that despite the busy Christmas period, only 30 copies of the album had been sold with the store. On 13 January 1982, McCartney's \\"Private Property\\" was released as the second single, backed with \\"Stop and Take the Time to Smell the Roses\\", in the US, but failed to chart anywhere. Nonplussed, RCA dropped Starr in 1982. For the first time in his career, Starr was out of a recording contract with neither a UK nor US label willing to sign him. On 12 December 1982, the \\"Wrack My Brain\\" promo aired on Parkinson. Stop and Smell the Roses was reissued on CD, on the same day as Old Wave, in the US by The Right Stuff on 22 August 1994 with bonus tracks. \\"Wrack My Brain\\" was re-released, this time on red vinyl, with \\"Private Property\\" as the B-side, on The Right Stuff on 1 November. A promotional CD was released in 1994 by Capitol, featuring three songs from both Old Wave (1983) and Stop and Smell the Roses. Starr released a re- recording of the bonus track \\"You Can't Fight Lightning\\" as a bonus track on his 2017 album Give More Love.

The base set of 144 cards was released on August 18, 2005 at the annual Gen Con Indy. The game is unique in its use of five-sided, stackable cards made of durable plastic as opposed to conventional paper. The original concept for the game is credited to Paul Barclay, Brandon Bozzi, Mike Elliott, Aaron Forsythe, and Robert Gutschera. Products and availability The game was available for purchase in comic and hobby game oriented stores across the United States and internationally (but only in English), its 144-card set sold in starter sets of 40 random cards (MSRP $12.99) and booster packs of 13 additional cards (MSRP $4.99). The first expansion, Last Hallow's Eve, was released on October 28, 2005, adding another 144 cards to the game. The expected theme of the expansion was the superstitions and myths about Halloween, but it turned out to be more of the same themes from the base set. The second expansion, Blanket of Lies, came out on February 24, 2006 and added 72 cards. Its theme is that of extraterrestrial invasion. This was the last Hecatomb expansion released. On May 24, 2006, Hecatomb was discontinued. One of the game's designers has unofficially cited the rising cost of oil (used in the manufacture of the plastic cards) as part of the reason for the discontinuation. Objective In the game, you play a powerful person called an endbringer. An endbringer's goal is to destroy the world by using creatures called abominations to reap the souls of others until he has enough power to bring about the apocalypse. Other endbringers have the same goal and you must battle for the right to bring about armageddon. The person who ends the world gains power and moves on to another world to repeat the process. Mechanics Hecatomb shares a number of mechanics with Magic: The Gathering, including the concept of \\"tapping\\" mana cards to play other cards of the same color from, and the way attacking and blocking works (with unblocked attacks moving the attacker closer to victory). The key new game mechanic in Hecatomb is the way abominations are constructed. Abominations are made up of from one to five minion cards, with the minions being stacked on top of each other. Each new minion is rotated as it is played onto an existing abomination. Because of the way the cards are constructed, with five sides and four transparent edges, the cards underneath can continue to be seen, and hence an abomination is a combination of all of their strengths and powers. Bonuses or special effects can be triggered when a minion of the correct color is played on top of the stack (based on the exposed trigger color of the minion which was previously on top). When abominations fight each other, damage is dealt from the top to the bottom of the minion stack. It is thus possible to have an abomination be reduced in size without being completely killed by having its upper minions destroyed. This adds additional strategy considerations when building up abominations, as one can somewhat protect weaker minions by placing stronger minions above them. Another mechanic which differs from Magic: The Gathering is the way in which any card can be played as a mana card, alleviating the need to have a certain percentage of cards which do nothing more than power other cards. This mechanic is also used in the Call of Cthulhu Collectible Card Game. Card types Hecatomb features four different types of cards: * Minions - The hideous creatures of the game. Minions are stitched together to form abominations, which are then used to reap souls or defend against enemy reaping attempts. * Fates - Occurrences. Fates represent curses, tricks, or other events. Fates have a one-time effect, after which they are discarded. * Relics - Objects which have strange magical or technological powers. Relics have a continuing effect on the game world and stay in play until destroyed. * Gods - Powerful deities from beyond, summoned to assist friendly forces or hinder the opposition. Gods typically have both a one-time effect and a continuous effect. Gods remain in play until destroyed, or until replaced with another god. Additionally, all cards have a doom type associated with them, represented both by card color and a small icon. This dooms are: Corruption, Deceit, Destruction, and Greed. Card sources The cards in Hecatomb draw from a variety of sources from ancient myth to the stories of H. P. Lovecraft, though some are generic creations of the designers of the game. Many cards are of the Lovecraftian (\\"Outsiders\\") and Aztec myth (\\"Aztecals\\") varieties.

(1998). \\"Earl Thomas Conley\\". In The Encyclopedia of Country Music. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 108. was an American country music singer-songwriter. Between 1980 and 2003, he recorded ten studio albums, including seven for RCA Records. In the 1980s and into the 1990s, Conley also charted more than thirty singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, of which eighteen reached Number One. His eighteen Billboard Number One country singles during the 1980s marked the most Number One hits by any artist in any genre during that decade, excluding Alabama and Ronnie Milsap. Biography =Early life= Conley was born October 17, 1941, in Portsmouth, Ohio, to Glenna Ruth (n√©e Davis; 1918-2002) and Arthur Conley (1910-1989). When he was fourteen, his father lost his job with the railroad, forcing the young boy to move in with his older sister in Jamestown, Ohio. He was offered a scholarship to an art school, but rejected it in favor of joining the U.S. Army. While in the Army, he became a member of a Christian-influenced trio, where his musical talent and vocal ability first became apparent. He then decided to consider performing as a serious career option. He shifted more deeply into the classic country sounds of artists such as Merle Haggard and George Jones. During this period he first tried his hand at songwriting. In 1968, after his honorable discharge from the Army, he began commuting from Dayton to Nashville. In 1973 while in Nashville, he met Dick Heard, who produced country music singer Mel Street. This meeting eventually led to the Conley-Heard collaboration on the song \\"Smokey Mountain Memories\\", which made the top 10 for Street. After his discharge from the military, Conley had been playing in clubs in Nashville at night, supporting himself by working blue-collar jobs during the day. =Career= Feeling that he wasn't making any progress in Nashville, Conley moved to Huntsville, Alabama to work in a steel mill. There, he met record producer Nelson Larkin, who helped him sign with independent record label GRT in 1974. Conley released four singles on that label, none of which became hits. At the same time, he was selling songs that he had written to other artists, including Conway Twitty and Mel Street, who were having much success with them. Conley returned to Nashville, now writing for Nelson Larkin's publishing house. In 1979, he signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records. Two years later, he had his first Top 40 hit, \\"Dreamin's All I Do\\". He left the label in 1979 and joined Sunbird Records, where he again worked with Larkin. This time, Conley found success with a Top Ten and a Number One single within the next two years. He continued to have success over the next few years and in 1983 he was nominated for multiple Grammy Awards for his song \\"Holding Her and Loving You\\". He set a record the following year as the first artist in any genre to have four Number One singles from the same album, Don't Make It Easy for Me (released in May 1983). In 1986, Conley was credited with breaking down country music barriers in his duet with pop/R&B; singer Anita Pointer of the Grammy-winning Pointer Sisters. Their single, \\"Too Many Times\\", the title track to his 1986 album, reached No. 2 on the Country chart. With the song, Conley also became the only country artist to appear on the syndicated music program Soul Train.\\"Jean Carne/Glenn Jones\\", Soul Train, Tribune Broadcasting, October 20, 1986 =Later years= By the end of the 1980s, Conley began collaborating with Randy Scruggs, son of country singer Earl Scruggs, in the hope that he could bring his music back to his country roots. His record sales began to drop in the 1990s, as country took a more progressive turn, and Conley was dropped from his record label in 1992. He took a seven-year recording hiatus between 1991 and 1997 due to a number of factors, including vocal problems, disenchantment with record label politics, road fatigue, and mental burnout. He began recording again in 1998. In late 2013, Conley gave a telephone interview with Pods o' Pop. Conley recalled that he may have been the only country artist to have appeared on the Soul Train television program (he performed his duet with Pointer) and went into detail about the string of hits Randy Scruggs and he co-wrote. In 2002, Blake Shelton charted in the Top 20 with \\"All Over Me\\", which Conley co-wrote with Shelton and longtime friend, songwriter Michael Pyle. =Death= Conley died on April 10, 2019, at 77 years old from cerebral atrophy.

In Series 2, it was just a box, with a set of electrically powered lifting forks, powered by a homemade system. It was emblazoned with the image of a spider. The spider was the result of a school competition to come up with a design of something that made you panic. A 12-year-old girl designed the spider. With his prize money from Series 2, Kim built a newer machine. This one had a srimech (self-righting mechanism), a new body shape, and more effective forks, which were capable of completely overturning opposing machines. The top-mounted self-righting mechanism proved to be unreliable, and was eventually removed. Added in Series 4 were a set of side \\"skirts\\" to prevent all but the lowest of robots from getting underneath it, as well as sloping sides. The fourth model had improved skirts, and the srimech was updated to a top flipper, which was the favourite with the driver Kim Davies, who stated it was, in his opinion, the best version. Panic Attack was constructed in Cwmbran, Wales. The Series 6 version was flatter, with silver forks and painted gold as opposed to yellow, as the team had run out of yellow paint when the time came to paint it. As a result, this model was unofficially, but universally nicknamed Panic Attack Gold. For Series 7, the fourth model was reused, with the addition of a rear skirt, and with the srimech being replaced by an anti-hammer cushioned top. The robot competed in Series 2-7 of Robot Wars, winning the second series and making the semi-finals in three other wars. It also won the \\"Sumo Basho\\" competition in Series 4, meaning that it was the only machine to defeat Shunt in this event twice. Panic Attack was one of the longest appearing robots, appearing in six wars and two extremes. Although the only grand champion never to reach another Grand Final, Panic Attack reached the most Semi-Finals of all Grand Champions at four. Panic Attack's signature move was to slip beneath a robot, using its forks to get a grip inside the opponent's armour, wheels or other openings, before driving into the pit release button and pushing it down the pit. It achieved this many times, against robots like Axe Awe, S.M.I.D.S.Y., Manta and Kat 3. The team also entered Panic Attack in one season of Battlebots, losing out to Frenzy. They returned next season with Scallywag, a wedge-shaped lifter with a colour scheme similar to Panic Attack. As champion of Series 2 and a good contestant in later wars, Panic Attack was one of the competitor robots immortalized in plastic when the Robot Wars toys were released. A 'Minibot' toy plus a working pullback with flipping spikes and a 'Pitstop' toy were released. Team Members The team captain of the robot was Kim Davies, who was originally joined by Kevin Pritchard and Lee Witcombe. In Series 3, Pritchard left the team to create a similar robot named Evil Weevil and Davies was joined by his son Michael and Simon Rosen. Christian Bridge won a competition in Robot Wars Magazine to join the team for Series 4. In Series 7, Davies got a job as a technical assistant on the show and left, so the team was entirely changed. Pritchard returned and took over the controls with teammates Paul Wier and then-webmaster of the official Panic Attack website, Jamie McGarry. Series 2 =Heats= Panic Attack was airborne in the gauntlet after Sir Killalot held down the end of the see-saw and Panic Attack drove off onto Dead Metal. Good control and driving meant it outmanoeuvred Shunt in the trial. It managed to flip Whirling Dervish with its spikes in the semi final, before winning the show by pushing Disruptor into the pit. =Semi-Final = In the Gauntlet, Panic Attack advanced exactly the same distance as Mace, meaning that the two had to run the course again at the same time. Mace was subsequently trapped and pitted by the Sentinel, putting Panic Attack through. In the trial, Panic Attack advanced through Pinball. In the semi-final battle, it beat the favourites Mortis by putting it into the pit. =Grand Final= Panic Attack won its Eliminator for the Grand Final by immobilising Killertron, and subsequently pushed Sgt. Bash into the pit. In the final itself, Panic Attack avoided being flipped by Cassius, and pushed it into the pit for a shock victory. Series 3 =UK Championship= Panic Attack flipped over first Axios and then Toe Cutter to reach the Heat Final against X-Terminator. After immobilising X-Terminator's weapon, Panic Attack flipped it over. In the Semi-Final, Panic Attack flipped over Thing 2 to advance to a battle for a place in the Grand Final, against Firestorm. This battle went to a judges' decision, in favour of Firestorm. =First World Championship= Panic Attack represented Wales in this tournament and fought 101 of England. In attempting to pit its opponent, Panic Attack drove itself into the pit. Series 4 Panic Attack were the winners of the Sumo Basho competition in Series 4, being the only robot to stay longer than Shunt on the Sumo platform. It was seeded 4th for reaching the semi finals in Series 3 and being an ex-champion. =Round 1 vs. Overkill GTI vs. SMIDSY= Panic Attack drove into Overkill. SMIDSY then got under Overkill, and Overkill flipped it later. Panic Attack wedged Overkill into the arena spike, and lifted it, before it was rammed by SMIDSY. Panic Attack lifted Overkill again onto the arena wall. Both Panic Attack and SMIDSY then pushed Overkill into the CPZ, and lifted it. It went to a judges decision and Overkill GTI was eliminated. =Round 2 vs. Saw Point= Panic Attack tried to lift Saw Point, but lifted itself instead. It then tipped Saw Point onto its side, and lifted it. It tried to flip Saw Point out of the arena but could not, so instead it pushed it around the arena. It was later considered immobilized and was dropped in the pit. =Round 3 vs. SMIDSY= SMIDSY rammed into Panic Attack's sides, and drove over the robot many times. Panic Attack then pushed SMIDSY into Shunt, but was caught itself by Dead Metal. Panic Attack then lifted SMIDSY and held it over the flame pit. Its fork had got stuck in SMIDSY's wheel opening, but Panic Attack managed to drag it around, eventually lowering SMIDSY in the pit. =Round 4 vs. Spawn Of Scutter= Spawn drove over Panic Attack, which lifted it and pushed it into the arena wall and Shunt's CPZ. Spawn tried to use its spike, but Panic Attack lifted it and wedged it on the arena wall =Round 5 vs. Stinger= Panic Attack drove into Stinger, but found it hard to attack. Stinger used its axe on Panic Attack's sides and lifting mechanism. Stinger spun around and hit Panic Attack many times. Panic Attack pushed Stinger into Matilda, but went into the CPZ. Panic Attack then pushed Stinger into the arena wall, but the judges decision meant that Stinger was the winner, who finished 3rd overall. The team were booed, as many thought that Panic Attack should have gone through. =War of Independence Round 1 vs. Rammstein (USA)= Although the American robot was heavier, Panic Attack easily turned it over with its lifting forks repeatedly but Rammstein was invertible and ran away. After a while though, Rammstein started to lose power as its batteries were designed for three minutes battle rather than the UK's five, so Panic Attack picked it up once more and dropped it into the pit. =War of Independence Round 2 vs. Mortis (UK)= This was a rematch from the Second Wars when Panic Attack pitted Mortis. Despite consistently lifting and pushing Mortis around the arena (at one point into Sir Killalot), Mortis pounded away on the top of Panic Attack with its axe and won on a very close judge's decision to beat Frenzy in the final and win the War of Independence. Series 5 Panic Attack was seeded 6th for this war. It now had improved side skirts and its self-righting mechanism could be used for lifting or trapping other robots. In Round 1, Panic Attack pushed a partially immobilised Barber-Ous into the pit, and then did the same in Round 2 against Tiberius 2. In the Heat Final against Kat 3, Panic Attack became stuck into its opponent, but pushed them into the pit. In its semi-final, Panic Attack were immobilised by Pussycat. It then went into the Loser's Melee, whereby the victor would return to the contest. Its opponents were Firestorm 3 and Wheely Big Cheese. The force of a flip on Panic Attack from the latter caused internal damage, and after Wheely Big Cheese broke down, the judges decided on Firestorm 3. Series 6 Panic Attack was seeded 8th for this series. Its design was vastly changed from previous years, with a flatter body, no self-righter, and four wheels instead of six. This version was colloquially referred to as \\"Panic Attack Gold\\" or \\"Panic Attack 24k\\" because it was painted gold and silver instead of its signature yellow and black. Davies was wholly unsatisfied with this version. In the First Round, Panic Attack fought Kronic 2, ROCS and Corkscrew. It received damage from Corkscrew, who later drove into the pit. ROCS were also eliminated after being flipped by Kronic 2. In Round 2, Panic Attack put A-Kill into the pit. In the Heat Final, Terrorhurtz continuously hit Panic Attack with their axe until it was immobilised. After having been counted out, Panic Attack had its top struck off by Matilda's flywheel. Series 7 Panic Attack was reverted to its chunkier body and caution-striped colour scheme. Its self-righter was replaced with a hard rubber panel for protection against overhead weapons, and a large skirt was added at the back. It was seeded 8th again. In Round 1, Panic Attack fought Mega Morg, Edge Hog and Spin Doctor. It flipped over Spin Doctor, who were counted out. Panic Attack and Mega Morg then co-operated to push Edge Hog into the pit. Panic Attack had its weapon immobilised by Tough As Nails in Round 2, who won on a judges' decision and went on to win the heat.

The series is set on a future, decimated Earth after the discovery of a mysterious, alien spacecraft dubbed \\"Orphan\\". A group of researchers scour the planet for Orphan's disc plates using mecha called \\"Antibodies\\" in order to revive the craft, an event that would result in the utter destruction of all lifeforms on Earth. The protagonists Yu Isami and Hime Utsumiya must utilize a special Antibody called \\"Brain Powerd\\" to counter the Orphan plans and save humanity. Brain Powerd was directed and written by Gundam creator Yoshiyuki Tomino. The series features mecha designs by Mamoru Nagano, character designs by Mutsumi Inomata, and music by Yoko Kanno. The 26-episode Brain Powerd television series originally premiered across Japan on the satellite channel WOWOW between April 8 and November 11, 1998. The series was also aired across Japan on the anime network Animax, which also later broadcast the series across its respective networks worldwide, including its English language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia. Animax aired Bandai Entertainment's localization, the series' English language television premiere. The anime series was licensed by Bandai and distributed across the region on DVD under the title Brain Powered. The series was also adapted into a manga, with art by Yukiru Sugisaki, which was serialized in Japan's Kadokawa Shoten magazine Sh≈çnen Ace and later published in the United States in English by Tokyopop. A series of light novels, music CDs, and other merchandise relating to Brain Powerd also exist. Plot Brain Powerd is set in a future time in which Earth has been afflicted by earthquakes and floods. The source of this is a traced to a gargantuan, alien spacecraft dubbed \\"Orphan\\", which sits deep beneath the Pacific Ocean. Scientists Kensaku Isami and Midori Isami work within Orphan in order to uncover its vast knowledge, reach the Earth's surface with the craft, and travel the galaxy, resulting in the annihilation of all lifeforms on Earth. Their agents, the \\"Reclaimers\\", pilot living organic mechas (or \\"Antibodies\\") in the army Grand Cher, and seek to retrieve Orphan's vital disc plates which are scattered across the planet. The series begins with the teenage lead Hime Utsumiya venturing upon such a disc plate, which revives into a unique Antibody, called \\"Brain Powerd\\", with which she forms a deep connection. Within a year, Hime joins a group wishing the counter the ideals of the Orphan researchers, stationed aboard the battleship Novis Noah. She is soon joined by Yu Isami, an ex-Reclaimer who leaves Orphan after learning of the catastrophe his parents seek to unleash. Hime and Yu soon enter upon an adventure which may decide the future of humanity. Production Brain Powerd was produced by Sunrise and directed and written by Yoshiyuki Tomino, the creator of the long-running Gundam franchise. Brain Powerd is often compared to the Gainax's popular Neon Genesis Evangelion, a 1995 anime series with similar themes to Brain Powerd. Tomino claimed that the plans and overall storyline for Brain Powerd were made even prior to the airing of Evangelion. He stated that he \\"never meant [Brain Powerd] to be an antithesis to Evangelion\\" despite the inevitable comparisons they would receive when his own series debuted in 1998. After deciding not to make any changes to Brain Powerd, he \\"resigned\\" himself to the fact that the public would label his anime an attempt to best Evangelion. Tomino was enthusiastic about his first attempt at the \\"organic\\" mecha subgenre in place of the purely metallic robots he had worked with for so many years in his career. He wanted to write an interesting story for Brain Powerd in order to allow those who watched it to do so without \\"having a nervous breakdown\\" and to show fans \\"that there were often other things out there better than anime\\". Tomino has wished that more animators would see themselves as entertainers, though he admitted that he felt that Brain Powerd was not very entertaining and thus a failure in this regard. Tomino was joined by a team of writers at Sunrise under the pseudonym Hajime Yatate. Other staff included The Weathering Continent and Windaria character designer Mutsumi Inomata; The Five Star Stories and Heavy Metal L-Gaim mecha designer Mamoru Nagano; and Macross Plus and The Vision of Escaflowne music composer Yoko Kanno. Nagano had also previously worked with Tomino Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. Kanno described Tomino as \\"not detailed at all\\" when compared to other directors with which she worked. She found that he was concerned with human \\"age\\" in regards to each piece of music so that viewers of all ages would understand. The opening theme \\"In My Dream\\" was written and performed by Eri Shingy≈çji. The ending theme was composed and arranged by Kanno, with lyrics written by Rin Iogi (a pseudonym for Tomino), and the song performed by Kokia. Media =Anime= The 26-episode Brain Powerd anime initially aired weekly on Japan's satellite channel WOWOW from April 8 to November 11, 1998. The series was also broadcast on the Japanese Animax and the Bandai Channel. Bandai first released the series on DVD in two halves on June 25, 1999 and September 25, 1999 as the Brain Powerd Perfect Box. Seven individual DVDs containing fewer episodes of the series each were released from July 25 to September 25, 2002. A \\"remastered\\" box set was released on August 24, 2007. Finally, Bandai released the entire series on DVD as Emotion the Best: Brain Powerd on April 7, 2011. The English-dubbed version of Brain Powerd premiered on Animax in South Asia and Southeast Asia. In late 2000, Bandai Entertainment acquired the rights to distribute a dub in North America with the spelling Brain Powered. As with the licensed Silent M√∂bius, only the first few episodes were released on VHS in the region as test marketing for the show. The original opening sequence, which largely depicts nude women, was completely redone for the release. Three separate bilingual DVD sets totaling all 26 episodes were made available in North American retailers May 21 to September 24, 2002. The unedited opening sequences was restored for the DVD version. On April 26, 2006, the company compiled and released the entire series as Anime Legends: Brain Powered Complete Collection. Following the 2012 closure of Bandai Entertainment, Sunrise announced at Otakon 2013, that Sentai Filmworks has rescued Brain Powerd, along with a handful of other former BEI titles. =Manga and light novels= A manga prelude to the Brain Powerd television series, featuring the original story penned by Tomino and illustrations by Yukiru Sugisaki, was serialized monthly in the Japanese Kadokawa Shoten magazine Sh≈çnen Ace beginning in the January 1998 issue. A total of four tank≈çbon chapter collections were released from May 27, 1998 to January 29, 2001. A series of three light novels written by Tomino and Akemi Mende were also published in Japan by Kadokawa Haruki Corporation: on December 15, 1998; on January 14, 1999; and on February 13, 1999. The original manga was licensed for English translation and publication by Tokyopop in early 2003, also with the spelling Brain Powered. All four volumes were published between June 17, 2003 and January 6, 2004. Tokyopop replaced the Japanese version's color pages with highly saturated monochrome for their English release. As of May 2, 2005, the manga is out-of-print in North America. =CDs and other merchandise= A two- volume soundtrack featuring a total of 38 background and vocal tracks from the Brain Powerd anime series was published by Victor Entertainment in Japan on August 5, 1998 and November 21, 1998. CD singles featuring the opening theme by Eri Shingy≈çji and the closing theme by Kokia have also been released. A non-scale model kit of Hime's Brain Powerd mecha was released by Bandai shortly after the show's debut. A single artbook titled Brain Powerd Spiral Book was published by Gakken in Japan on June 28, 1999. Characters and mecha from Brain Powerd have been featured alongside other Sunrise properties in video games published by Banpresto including Another Century's Episode for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable, 2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha for the PlayStation 2, and Super Robot Wars J for the Game Boy Advance. Reception Brain Powerd has received mostly mixed reception. Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy of The Anime Encyclopedia summarized Brain Powerd \\"as if Tomino and his crew were thrown in at the deep end and told to wing it\\", though still found it \\"curiously watchable, thanks largely to Yoko Kanno's wonderful music\\".

The park's main feature is its man-made lake, Lake Arthur, formed by impounding Muddy Creek, which is and is used for recreational purposes. The surrounding park is used for hiking, bicycling, group camping, picnicking, and hunting. Moraine State Park hosts the annual Regatta at Lake Arthur in August. The park was the location of the 1973 and 1977 National Scout Jamborees. Moraine State Park is at the intersection of Interstate 79 and U.S. Route 422 and shares a border with Jennings Environmental Education Center to the north. Moraine State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of State Parks as one of \\"25 Must- See Pennsylvania State Parks\\". History Moraine State Park is named for the glacial moraines that cover its land. The moraines were formed at the conclusion of the Last glacial period, a time when glaciers covered much of North America. A tongue of the glacier reached into Pennsylvania and, as the ice receded, left deposits of gravel, sand and clay. These created a landscape of gently rolling hills. The Erie was the area's dominant Indian tribe until they were all but wiped out by the Iroquois during the Beaver Wars of the 1600s. The French and Dutch demand for beaver pelts gave rise to great struggles for control of the territory between Indian nations as well as later open conflict between the British and French. English Settlers followed French fur trappers into the Moraine State Park area during the 1700s. George Washington travelled through the park area while he was a young colonel with the Virginia Militia in his attempt to notify the French the area was claimed by the English. Washington most likely stayed twice within park boundaries and was shot at and narrowly escaped being killed by an Indian just south of the park. There is a Pre-Revolutionary cabin behind the Davis Hollow Marina that is the headquarters of the Pennsylvania Chapter of the North Country Trail Association. Visitors may still book an overnight stay at the cabin. Nearby historic structures also include Old Stone House, a historic tavern and trading stop that has been turned into a museum by Slippery Rock University. McConnell's Mill is a rustic early American grist mill and central attraction at neighboring McConnell's Mill State Park. Farmers cleared the land of trees and drained the swamps, but farming was difficult due to the glacial till beneath the shallow soil. Other settlers turned to the natural resources left by the glaciers and mined sand and gravel deposits. Limestone and clay mines were opened in the area; shale was discovered and was mined, as well as bituminous coal. Coal mining was a profitable enterprise and seven coal beds were deep mined and later strip mined. Later still, wells were drilled to extract oil and natural gas from deep within the Earth. When the mines were cleared and the wells tapped out, the land was left barren. Since the mines were left uncapped, the topsoil eroded from the land. The rebirth of the land in and surrounding Moraine State Park can be tied to the efforts of Frank W. Preston who moved to nearby Meridian in 1926. He had emigrated from England to establish a glass research lab. In addition to his work with glass, Preston was also a geologist and naturalist. On a trip to the Muddy Creek Valley he noticed that, despite the barren landscape that had been left by the oil wells and strip mines, the valley had a rich natural history of moraines. Preston worked to form the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, which purchased the land that became Moraine State Park, recreated the glacial landscape and preserved open spaces. Muddy Creek was dammed to form Lake Arthur. The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy worked with the state to reclaim the land. The mines were sealed, over 400 oil and gas wells were capped, and the land that had been stripped was covered again with back fill, and graded to resemble its former condition. The soil was specially treated with fertilizer to allow for the growth of thousands of trees, shrubs and grasses. Lake Arthur was completed in 1970 with the opening of Moraine State Park on May 23, 1970. =Environment= Moraine State Park is part of the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion. Recreation =Hunting= Hunting is permitted on of Moraine State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, waterfowl, squirrels, pheasants, bear, turkey, white-tailed deer, and rabbits. The hunting of groundhogs is not permitted at the park. =Lake Arthur= Lake Arthur is open for year-round recreational enjoyment. It is the home of the Lake Arthur Sailing Club and the Regatta at Lake Arthur. In addition to sailing, the lake is a popular fishing destination, and it has two swimming beaches. Osprey and bald eagles have made nests in the tree tops along Lake Arthur since the mid-1990s. Sailing on Lake Arthur All boats up to are permitted on Lake Arthur. All powered boats are prohibited in the Game Propagation Area. Sailing is an especially popular activity. Races and regattas are held over the course of the summers. Sailboats, rowboats, kayaks, motorboats, canoes, and pontoon boats are available to rent in the Crescent Bay Area. There are two fueling points for power boats. Tenants pay to keep boats at the park's two marinas. Davis Hollow houses both pontoons and sailboats, while Watts Bay houses sailboats and catamarans. Both marinas are on the North Shore. All boats must have a current registration from any state or a launch permit from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The lake is open to ice boating during the winter months. Ice boats must display a state park launch permit. The Moraine Preservation Fund operates a Passenger boat available for tours and dinner cruises of Lake Arthur. The organization also operates a gift shop and has been responsible for re-establishing many bird species, environmental education programs and attaining additional land for the park. A section of the lake near Barber's Point is very popular for windsurfing. This is due to the higher than normal winds and relatively low boat traffic. All windsurfers are required to have a launch permit. Windsurfing lessons are available. Fall day at Lake Arthur Lake Arthur is a warm water fishery. The native fish species are largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie and channel catfish. The fish commission stocks a population of walleye, muskellunge, and striped bass. All anglers are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Lake Arthur is open during the winter months for ice fishing. Two beaches at Moraine State Park are open for swimming daily, Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend from 11:00am until 7:00pm. Pleasant Valley Beach on the south shore is a 1,200 foot (365 m) grass and sand beach. It has a paved path that leads into the water and a sand volleyball court is nearby. Lakeview Beach on the north shore is a long sand beach. Each beach has a bathhouse with showers and a snack stand. =Trails= The trails at Moraine State Park are all open to hiking. Some are also open to equestrian, cross-country skiing, bicycles, and mountain bikes. The North Country Trail which begins near Lake Champlain in New York passes through the park on its way to Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota. The Butler chapter of the North Country Trail Association maintains the Davis Hollow Cabin, a historic settler's cabin that hikers stop at to sleep and eat. *Hilltop Trail is a \\"moderate\\" hiking trail, long. It is marked with green blazes. The trail begins and ends near the Bear Run Boat Launch. The trail is flat and grassy in sections before rising to steeper areas. It passes through different stages of forest regeneration, past bluebird houses and the remnants of a spring house. The trail is located on the South Shore, *Sunken Garden Trail is a \\"moderate\\" hiking trail, long. It is marked with pink blazes. The loop trail begins and ends near the Pleasant Valley Boat Launch. The trail passes through a large wetland area, a stand of White Pine, a small pond and along the edge of Lake Arthur. It is located on South Shore. *Pleasant Valley Trail is an \\"easy\\" hiking trail, long. It is marked with yellow blazes. Pleasant Valley Trail passes over hills and through valleys on the South Shore of Lake Arthur. *Wyggeston Trail is a \\"moderate\\" to \\"difficult\\" hiking trail, long. It is marked with orange blazes. The trail begins just west of Pennsylvania Route 528 on Christley Road and ends at Old Route 422. The trail is rough and rocky and passes through an undeveloped part of the park that includes historic remnants of an old house foundation, stone fences, and a historic oil pump house. *Glacier Ridge Trail is a \\"difficult\\" hiking trail, long. It is part of the North Country Trail and is marked with blue blazes. Glacier Ridge Trail connects Moraine State Park with the Jennings Environmental Education Center via the North Shore. *Five Points Trail is an \\"easy\\" hiking trail, long. It is marked with light green blazes and is near Lakeview Beach and the cabins on the North Shore. =Cemeteries= Being a man-made lake, several properties were purchased by the government for the creation of the lake. Some of these properties contained burial plots. The most famous of these plots is Snyder Cemetery. The cemetery is known for its frequent hauntings that have been perceived by many different people. Other cemeteries in the area include: Davis Cemetery, Shaffer Cemetery, McCandless Cemetery, Robertson Cemetery, Horse Cemetery and many others. =Staying overnight= Guests interested in staying overnight at Moraine State Park have three options. A limited number of guests may use a shelter on the North Country Trail that is available on a reservation basis. Organized large groups, such as Boy Scouts can use one of two large group tenting area. Both areas lack showers, but they do have picnic tables, cooking grills and fresh water. There are eleven modern cabins available to rent at Moraine State Park. They are heated with electricity and sleep up to six people in two bedrooms. The cabins also have modern bathrooms, kitchens, a dining/living area and a dock on Lake Arthur. Renters need to bring their own bed linens, towels, cookware and tableware. =Winter recreation= Moraine State Park is open year-round, and it stays busy with visitors during the winter months.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the California Angels, Toronto Blue Jays, Florida Marlins, Arizona Diamondbacks, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Milwaukee Brewers. He currently serves as the first base coach for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. Early life Born as Devon Whyte in Kingston, Jamaica, his family immigrated to the United States when he was nine years old. However, the paperwork had their family name misspelled as \\"White\\". His last name was legally changed back to its original spelling in 2003 at the behest of his children, but throughout his baseball playing career, he was known as \\"Devon White\\" and continues to sign autographs with that spelling. His daughter, Davellyn Whyte, played two seasons of professional basketball in the WNBA. White attended Park West High School in Manhattan, New York City. White was primarily a basketball player in high school and only began playing baseball after watching New York Yankees and Mets games on television with his father. White received a scholarship offer to play both college basketball and college baseball for the Oklahoma State Cowboys. Baseball career =California Angels= White was drafted by the California Angels in the 6th round of the 1981 draft. He made his major league debut in the late stages of the season for California, but he did not establish himself as a major leaguer until , when he played a full season and hit with power and ran the basepaths with speed. In fact, he hit 24 home runs and stole 32 bases that season. In , only his second full season, he won his first of seven Gold Gloves. On September 9, 1989, he became one of the few players in baseball history to get on first base then score by stealing second base, third base, and home.https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CAL/CAL198909090.shtml =Toronto Blue Jays= On December 2, , he was traded with Willie Fraser and Marcus Moore to the Toronto Blue Jays for Junior F√©lix and Luis Sojo. White won two World Series and five Gold Gloves with the Toronto Blue Jays. With a .336 batting average in his post-season career with the Blue Jays, compared to a .270 regular season average with Toronto, White consistently upped his game to help Toronto reach playoff success. In 1992, White collected 3.9 Defensive Wins Above Replacement, which led the major leagues.Devon White Stats Baseball-Reference.com. Accessed on September 15, 2020. In Game 3 of the 1992 World Series against the Atlanta Braves, White was the central part of one of the most famous plays in World Series history. With David Justice batting and runners on first and second base, Justice hit a fly ball which White chased down and caught while jumping into the wall. White then threw the ball to second baseman Roberto Alomar who threw to John Olerud at first to try to double up Terry Pendleton, but Pendleton had already been called out for running past Deion Sanders. Olerud promptly threw the ball to third baseman Kelly Gruber who chased down Sanders, diving and clipping him on the heel with his glove. However the umpire, Bob Davidson, did not see the tag, and called Sanders safe, which cost the Jays the second triple play in World Series history. After the game, Davidson watched the replay and admitted he missed the call. Many people who saw White's famous catch and throw have positively compared it to Willie Mays' famous catch in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series, often claiming that White's effort was more impressive. =Later years: Florida Marlins and Arizona Diamondbacks= After the 1995 season, White signed with the Florida Marlins and won another World Series in , although he only hit .215 in the playoffs that year. He later played with the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Milwaukee Brewers before retiring in . =Career statistics= In 1941 games over 17 seasons, White posted a .263 batting average (1934-for-7344) with 1125 runs, 378 doubles, 71 triples, 208 home runs, 846 RBI, 346 stolen bases, 541 bases on balls, .319 on-base percentage and .419 slugging percentage.

The organization saved the lives of 7,000 Jewish children by helping them to leave Nazi Germany for Mandatory Palestine before and during the Holocaust. Recha Freier was also a poet, musician, teacher and social activist. Early life Recha Schweitzer was born into a Jewish Orthodox family. Her parents were Bertha (n√©e Levy, 1862‚Äì1945 in Theresienstadt), a French and English teacher, and Menashe Schweitzer (1856‚Äì1929), who taught several subjects at a Jewish primary school. She grew up in a music-loving family and learned to play the piano. Already as a child Recha Schweitzer was confronted with antisemitism: a notice in Norden's city park stated that \\"Dogs and Jews are forbidden.\\" In 1897 her family moved to Silesia, where she received home-schooling for a while before attending the lyc√©e in Glogau, where she was mocked by her classmates because she wouldn't write on the Sabbath. Her reaction to the humiliation inflicted upon her had a lifelong impact on her and made her become a full-hearted Zionist. Recha Schweitzer completed her gymnasial studies in Breslau, passed the exams for teachers of religion, and studied as a graduate student of philology in Breslau and Munich. Family life and career In 1919 she married Rabbi Dr. Moritz \\"Moshe\\" Freier (1889‚Äì1969), with whom she moved to Eschwege, Sofia, and finally in 1925 to Berlin, where her husband worked as a rabbi. Their sons Shalhevet, Ammud and Zerem were born in 1920, 1923 and 1926 respectively, and their daughter Ma'ayan in 1929. During this time, in addition to her family obligations, Recha Freier worked as a teacher at a German high school in Sofia, and as a writer and folklorist. Youth Aliyah activities In 1932, one year before the Nazi seizure of power, Recha Freier was asked by her husband to assist five Jewish teenage boys who were denied professional training and employment due to their Jewish background. After turning first to the Jewish Employment Agency, who could only counsel patience, she conceived the idea that the boys instead could be sent to Palestine, where they could be trained as farmers in the Jewish workers' settlements. By the end of 1932, the first group of youth left Berlin with the help of funds raised by Freier. This proved to be the beginning of the Youth Aliyah. \\"The utter senselessness of Jewish life in the Diaspora stood palpably before my eyes\\", she wrote. After that she strove incessantly to save the Jewish youth of Germany. The difficulties which Recha Freier faced were immense. Jewish organizations and parents were skeptical about the plan to send children alone to a distant country. In January 1933, Recha Freier founded in Berlin the Committee for the Assistance of Jewish Youth or Youth Aliyah (Hilfskomitee f√ºr J√ºdische Jugend), which was recognized by the World Zionist Congress but which at that stage received no financial support. Recha Freier contacted the labor movement in Palestine, as well as Henrietta Szold, the founder of Hadassah, who had at her disposal the support, financial and otherwise, of American Jewry. Freier asked Szold to take charge of the teenagers after their arrival in Palestine. Szold initially opposed the plan, finding it unfeasible, but eventually accepted the role offered to her by Freier and thus become the director of Youth Aliyah's Jerusalem office. In 1938, Recha Freier worked alongside people such as Aaron Menschel, director of the Vienna Youth Aliyah office, in an endeavor to save Austrian Jews. In this year too, largely coinciding with the Kristallnacht pogrom, Jews in Germany of Polish Nationality, were arrested and sent to concentration camps. Freier endeavored to obtain the release of these Jews from the camps. This became possible by making use of permits issued by the Nazi authorities and given to the Jewish representative body‚Äîthe Reich Association of Jews in Germany‚Äîfor distribution to such Jews as could undertake to leave Germany within two weeks of receiving the permit. Freier took 100 such permits, without permission, and filled in the names of Jewish concentration camp prisoners. These prisoners were released and ultimately reached Palestine. When it became known that Freier had taken the permits without the knowledge of the officers of the Reich Association of Jews in Germany, Freier was informed that she was not allowed to take any more permits, and was ousted from the Zionist leadership in Berlin, including her position as the director of the Youth Aliyah offices. Freier remained in Nazi Germany until the middle of 1940 and then crossed the border into Yugoslavia illegally with the help of professional smugglers. Even after entering Yugoslavia she continued her activities and managed to save 150 youths whose parents had already perished in concentration camps. After a sojourn of several months in Yugoslavia she continued to Palestine in 1941. When Freier arrived in Jerusalem, Szold told Freier that there was no room for her in the running of the Youth Aliyah in Palestine. Thus Freier withdrew from her formal role within the Youth Aliyah. In 1943, Freier established the Agricultural Training Center for Israeli children whose aim it was to provide a proper education for children from impoverished families; children living in inferior social conditions. This she did by arranging for these children to be brought up in a Kibbutz, in workers‚Äô settlements or in family units set up for this purpose. Henrietta Szold is often wrongly assumed as the founder of the Youth Aliyah. It was only after Henrietta Szold‚Äôs death in 1945, when Moshe Kol was at the head of the Youth Aliyah organization (1947-1966), that Freier‚Äôs achievements in establishing the organization and in saving thousands of German Jewish youth was recognized. This came about after Freier brought a lawsuit against Kol, alleging that her role in establishing the Youth Aliyah movement and in saving the lives of thousands of Jewish youth from Europe, was being purposely ignored. By 1939, Youth Aliyah saved 7,000 youths, who made aliya to Palestine and were absorbed into worker‚Äôs settlements. Music and opera In 1958, Freier established the Israel Composer's Fund, and in 1966 she founded, together with the composer Roman Haubenstock-Ramati, the Festival \\"Testimonium\\" (\\"Witness\\"), designed to support the setting to music the stories of central events in the life of the Jewish people. For this purpose she managed to engage the help of notable composers, both Jewish and non- Jewish, such as Ben-Zion Orgad, Mauricio Kagel, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Iannis Xenakis, Lukas Foss and others.\\"Freier, Recha (1892‚Äì1984)\\", Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia, accessed 30 June 2017). She also wrote a number of libretti for Israeli composers. These included Mark Kopytman (Chamber Scenes from the Life of S√ºsskind von Trimberg, written for the \\"Testimonium\\" series, 1982), Josef Tal (Amnon and Tamar, 1958, based on the Book of Samuel), and Yitzchak Sadai (Trail 19, 1982).Hirschberg (2017), pp. 326-329. Recha Freier (c. 1964) Late recognition Recha Freier, through her activities in the Youth Aliyah, saved over 7,000 young Jews who immigrated to Palestine and were absorbed into the Yishuv. Recognition first came in 1975, when the 83-years-old received an honorary doctorate from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for her initial idea of \\"organized transport of youth into kibbutzim\\", and in 1981 she received the Israel Prize for her life‚Äôs work, her outstanding contribution to the people and State of Israel, in the field of Social Welfare, Community and Youth.

Youth Aliyah arranged for their resettlement in Palestine in kibbutzim and youth villages that became both home and school. Aliyah means the Zionist tenet of going to Jerusalem. History Recha Freier, a rabbi's wife, founded Youth Aliyah in Berlin on the same day that Adolf Hitler took power, Monday 30 January 1933. The organisation was founded to protect German Jewish youth by sending them to pioneer training programs in Palestine after completing elementary school. The idea was supported by the World Zionist Organization. Freier supervised the organization's activities in Germany, and Henrietta Szold, after at first opposing Freier's initiative, in Jerusalem. Szold was skeptical about the merits of Freier's proposal because, as the person responsible for social services by the Jewish Agency for all of Palestine, she was extremely pressed for funds and loath to take on a new untried program for German Jewish children. Then Recha Freier approached Dr. Siegfried Lehman, founder and director of Ben Shemen Youth Village. He agreed to accept 12 children. Henrietta Szold was informed and changed her mind, agreeing to organize and lead the effort. At the time, Tamar de Sola Pool, a former national president of Hadassah, and her husband had just completed a visit to Palestine and were about to return to the US. Szold met her and explained the decision to initiate the major effort of Youth Aliyah and that Mrs de Sola Pool must convince Hadassah to accept it as an important project. She was convinced and, after convincing Hadassah, called Eddie Cantor, the actor- comedian. He wrote her a check for $25,000 to start the program. Hadassah has continued to be the major supporter of Youth Aliyah to this day. With Hitler's rise to power the Nuremberg Racial Laws were enacted in 1935 and on 31 March 1936 German elementary schools were closed to Jewish children. Szold coordinated an appeal to Jewish communities around the world in conjunction with the Jewish Agency.Rescue Jewish Youth! A Message from Henrietta Szold, January 1936, The Jewish Agency-Youth Aliyah Bulletin, January 1987 After a brief period of training in Germany, Youth Aliyah youngsters were placed on kibbutzim for two years to learn farming and Hebrew. Kibbutz Ein Harod in the Jezreel Valley was one of the first cooperative settlements to host such groups. Many of the children found it difficult being separated from their families, and they often realized the reasons for their journey and that they would not be returning to Europe. Parents struggled with the decision to send off their children to Palestine and expected to join them there later on, however many perished in the Holocaust. Youth Aliyah had a quota system in which they required at least 60% of the children to be boys, in order to ensure that a substantial number could work on the farms. Just before the outbreak of World War II, when immigration certificates to Palestine became difficult to obtain, Youth Aliyah activists in London came up with an interim solution whereby groups of young people would receive pioneer training in countries outside the Third Reich until they could immigrate to Palestine. Out of the approximately 10,000 children who migrated to Great Britain under the auspices of the Kindertransport program, some intended to reach Palestine with Youth Aliyah at a later time.Last Train to London, Eva Michaelis-Stern, The Jewish Agency-Youth Aliyah Bulletin, January 1987 After this British policy was formulated in November 1938, it facilitated not only thousands of Jewish children settling in the United Kingdom on a permanent basis, but also 3,400 staying there temporarily on the way to Palestine.Kaplan, Marion A. (1999). Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish life in Nazi Germany. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 116-117. As the war spread across Europe, the program expanded to save children from occupied countries such as Yugoslavia. Freier experienced significant opposition from the Jewish community in Germany, who continued to believe that appeasement and accommodation was the best course for Germany's Jews. In 1938 she was expelled from the board of the organisation that she had founded, the Jewish Youth Support Committee, because of her controversial use of illegal methods. In 1940 she was denounced by colleagues for anti-Nazi agitation, but was warned in time, and managed to flee to Palestine, taking 40 teenagers with her. After World War II and the Holocaust, emissaries were sent to Europe to locate child survivors in displaced persons camps. A Youth Aliyah office was opened in Paris. Children's homes in Eastern Europe were moved to Western Europe, Youth Aliyah believing (correctly) that immigration from Communist countries would be difficult later on.40 Years of Friendship, Moshe Kol, The Jewish Agency - Youth Aliyah Bulletin,\\" January 1987 In all 5,000 teenagers were brought to Palestine before World War II and educated at Youth Aliyah boarding schools. Others were smuggled out of occupied Europe in the early years of the war, some to Palestine, others to the United Kingdom and other countries. After the war an additional 15,000, most of them Holocaust survivors, were brought to Palestine. Later, Youth Aliyah became a department of the Jewish Agency.70th anniversary of Youth Aliyah Over the years, the organization has brought young people to Israel from North Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Soviet Union and Ethiopia. Today Youth Aliyah Child Rescue continues to play a role in the absorption of young newcomers to Israel, particularly from the former Soviet Union and Africa. In addition, the organisation offers a second chance to Israeli youth who have been designated ‚Äòat risk‚Äô by child care authorities. Children in the care of Youth Aliyah are housed in five youth residential villages in Israel. The villages include schools, dorms, clubhouses and playgrounds, and offer emotional support, education, developmental training and extra-curricular activity. More than 2,000 children have found a home and a new and more meaningful life through the organization. The children come from a wide variety of backgrounds, and often have serious emotional, psychological and behavioral difficulties. Many come from disadvantaged, low income or dysfunctional families, very often single-parent families. They are often at risk because of poverty, neglect, domestic violence, sexual abuse, drug or alcohol abuse, mental illness, homelessness or delinquent behaviour. Other children suffer from cancer and need respite care, while others come from families that have been victims of terror. Alonei Yitzhak was founded in 1948, houses 400 youth, and emphasises music, drama and dance. Neve Hadassah, near Netanya, houses 310 youth. Talpiot, in Hadera, houses 200 youth. Torah o‚ÄôMikzoah, south of Hadera, caters specifically to religious teenage boys unable to fit into a high school yeshiva environment. Alongside education in torah, it offers vocational training in motor mechanics and engineering. Yemin Orde, near Haifa, houses 500 youth. It has twice received the President‚Äôs Award for Excellence in Education. Outreach programs run throughout the summer months. This facility was destroyed by wildfire in 2011, and is being rebuilt.  Awards  * In 1958, Youth Aliyah was awarded the Israel Prize for its contribution to education, being the first year in which the Prize was awarded to an organization. Directors Directors of Youth Aliyah after the establishment of the State of Israel include Moshe Kol, Meir Gottesmann (1978‚Äì1984), Uri Gordon and Eli Amir.

It is also regionally called scrub oak, oak brush, and white oak.Flora of North America: Distribution range map for Quercus gambelii As the Gambel oak and Quercus gambelii, it was named after the American naturalist William Gambel (1821-1849). Distribution The natural range of Quercus gambelii is centered in the western United States and northwestern Mexico, in the states of Arizona, Chihuahua, Colorado, New Mexico, Sonora, and Utah. It also extends into Nevada, Wyoming, Idaho, Nebraska, the Oklahoma Panhandle, Coahuila, and western Texas.SEINet, Southwestern Biodiversity, Arizona chapter The tree typically grows at altitudes of above sea level, where precipitation averages between per year. Gambel oak leaves. Bark on a mature Gambel oak. Description Quercus gambelii trees vary significantly in size from one location to another. The average mature height is from , but occasionally reaches heights of in some locations. Dwarf stands of plants under tall are common in marginal areas where heavy browsing occurs. The largest trees are found in the southern range of the species along streams. These trees reach up to 100 feet tall. The champion tree is in Arizona at 114 feet tall. https://www.americanforests.org/big-trees/gambel-oak-quercus-gambelii-2/ Although the tree's wood is hard and dense, its branches are irregular and crooked, making them flexible enough to bend without breaking when covered with heavy snow. The bark is rough and brownish-gray. The leaves are generally long and broad, deeply lobed on each side of the central vein; the upper surface is glossy dark green, the undersurface is paler and velvety. They frequently turn orange and yellow during autumn, creating mountainsides of vivid colors. The flowers are inconspicuous unisexual catkins that occur in the spring. The acorns are long, and about one-third to one-half enclosed by a cap or cup (cupule); they mature in September, turning from green to golden brown. The plant reproduces from acorns, but also spreads most rapidly from root sprouts that grow from vast underground structures called lignotubers. These reproductive characteristics often result in dense groves or thickets of the trees that often cover entire mountainsides. Habitat Quercus gambelii flourishes in full sun on hillsides with thin, rocky, alkaline soil where competition from other plant species is limited. It also does well in richer soils, but in those areas it is forced to compete for growing room. It is well-adapted to locations where wet springs and hot, dry summers create conditions conducive to wildfires. After a fire, Gambel oak quickly re- establishes itself from root spouts. The plant is also quite drought tolerant. Associated plant species can include: chokecherry, arrowleaf balsamroot, bigtooth maple, mountain mahogany, ponderosa pine, and serviceberry. Associated birds and mammals include Woodhouse's scrub jay, black-billed magpie, grouse, deer, chipmunks and squirrels. Uses Because of its abundance, the Gambel oak is an important food source for browsing animals such as deer and livestock. The sweetish acorns are frequently gathered by squirrels and stored for winter food; they are also eaten by wild turkeys and domestic animals such as hogs. Some insects depend on the Gambel oak: for example, the Colorado hairstreak butterfly uses it as a food source for caterpillars. Historically, acorns from Gambel oak provided a reliable source of food for Native Americans.University of Michigan‚ÄîDearborn: Native American Ethnobotany of Quercus gambelii References External links * *photo of herbarium specimen at Missouri Botanical Garden, collected in the Mexican State of Nuevo M√©xico (present-day US State of New Mexico) in 1847 gambelii Category:Trees of the Western United States Category:Trees of Northwestern Mexico Category:Flora of the Rocky Mountains Category:Flora of Arizona Category:Flora of Colorado Category:Flora of New Mexico Category:Flora of Utah Category:Plants described in 1848 Category:Taxa named by Thomas Nuttall Category:Plants used in Native American cuisine ","title":"Quercus gambelii"},{"id":"2536810","text":"Bhavabhuti was an 8th-century scholar of India noted for his plays and poetry, written in Sanskrit. His plays are considered the equal of the works of Kalidasa. Bhavabhuti was born in Padmapura, Vidarbha, in Gondia district, on Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh border. He is described as an 'Udumbara Brahmin'. His real name was Srikantha Nilakantha, and he was the son of Nilakantha and Jatukarni. He received his education at 'Padmapawaya', a place some 42 km South-West of Gwalior. Dayananidhi Paramahansa is known to be his guru. He composed his historical plays at 'Kalpi', a place on banks of river Yamuna. He is believed to have been the court poet of king Yashovarman of Kannauj. Kalhana, the 12th-century historian, places him in the entourage of the king, who was defeated by Lalitaditya Muktapida, king of Kashmir, in 736 AD. Malatimadhava The play is set in the city of Padmavati. The king desires that his minister's daughter Malati marry a youth called Nandana. Malati is in love with Madhava ever since she saw him and drew his portrait. Madhava reciprocates, and draws a portrait of her in turn. Malati suspects her father's motives in falling in with the King's plans for her. A side plot involves the lovers' friends Makaranda and Madayantika. The latter is attacked by a tiger, and Makaranda rescues her, getting wounded in the process. After numerous travails, all ends well, with the two couples uniting. According to the renowned Sanskritist Daniel H.H. Ingalls, the Malatimadhava is a work that combines love and horror with a felicity never again equaled in Sanskrit literature. Indebtedness to Kautilya and Arthashastra According to Dasharatha Sharma, the dramatists Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti utilized the Arthashastra of Kautilya while composing their famous works. Kalidasa is indebted to Kautilya's Arthashastra for material in the Raghuvamsa.Indian Historical Quarterly Vol XXV, part 2 Similarly, Bhavabhuti utilizes words and ideas from the Arthashastra in the Malatimadhava and the Mahaviracharita. There is indeed a striking resemblance between the methods advocated by Ravana's minister, Malayavana and the policies suggested by Kautilya in the Arthashastra.'Bhavabhuti's Indebtedness to Kautilya' Journal of the Ganganath Jha Research Institute Vol VIII, part 3, May 1951 Legacy Late Laxmanrao Mankar Guruji named his education society as \\"Bhavbhuti Education Society\\" in 1950.

From through , Cowens played for the Kansas City Royals (1974‚Äì79), California Angels (1980), Detroit Tigers (1980‚Äì81) and Seattle Mariners (1982‚Äì86). He batted and threw right-handed. Baseball career A native of Los Angeles, California, Cowens was a product of the Kansas City Royals farm system, having been selected by the team in the 1969 MLB draft. He made his major league debut with the Royals in 1974 and played for them through 1979. His most productive season came in 1977, when he batted .312 with 23 home runs and 112 RBI, earned a Gold Glove, and finished second to Rod Carew in balloting for the American League MVP Award. In December 1979, the Royals traded Cowens to the California Angels. Early in the 1980 season, the Angels traded him to the Detroit Tigers, where he played through the end of the 1981 season. In March 1982, the Tigers sold his contract the Seattle Mariners, where he played until the team released him in June 1986. Overall in 13 MLB seasons, Cowens appeared in 1584 MLB games, batting .270 with 108 home runs and 717 RBIs. He played in three postseason series, appearing in 14 total games with the Royals in the American League Championship Series of 1976 through 1978, each of which the team lost to the New York Yankees. =Farmer incidents= Early in the 1979 season, a notable feud started between Cowens, then with the Royals, and pitcher Ed Farmer, then with the Texas Rangers. On May 8, a Farmer pitch thrown in the top of the fifth inning fractured Cowens' jaw and broke several teeth, causing him to miss 21 games. Farmer later said that Cowens had attempted to steal signs from the catcher and thought the pitch would be a breaking ball away, but it was actually an inside fastball. At the start of the same game, Farmer had also hit Royals second baseman Frank White and broke his wrist, which kept him sidelined for a month. The next season, on June 20‚Äö 1980, Farmer and Cowens faced each other again; Farmer now with the Chicago White Sox and Cowens now with the Tigers. In a game at Comiskey Park, with Farmer pitching, Cowens hit a ground ball to shortstop. While Farmer watched his infielders make the play, Cowens ran to the mound rather than first base, and tackled the pitcher from behind, landing several punches before the benches cleared and the two were separated. American League president Lee MacPhail suspended Cowens for seven games, and Farmer filed a criminal complaint, resulting in a warrant being issued for Cowens in Illinois. Later, Farmer agreed to drop the charges in exchange for a handshake‚Äö and the two players brought out the lineup cards before a game in Detroit on September 1, and shook hands. A later appearance by Cowens at Comiskey Park was greeted by fans with a \\"Coward Cowens\\" banner. Death Cowens died in Downey, California, on March 11, 2002, at the age of 50 from a heart attack. At the time of his death, Cowens had been scouting players for the Kansas City Royals. He is buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.

In modern usage it may refer to the winter solstice in certain Eastern European languages, and also to the holiday of Christmas.

Max Vasmer derived the name of the holiday from the Proto-Slavic *korƒçun≈≠, which is in turn derived from the verb *korƒçati, meaning to step forward. Gustav Weigand, and Alexandru Philippide offer a similar Slavic etymology, based on krat≈≠k≈≠ (curt, short) or kraƒçati (to make steps). On the other hand, Hugo Schuchardt, Vatroslav Jagiƒá and proposed a Romanian origin of the word,Archiv f√ºr Slavische Philologie, 1886, Vol XI, pp. 526‚Äì7.Archiv f√ºr Slavische Philologie, Vol II, p. 610.Archiv f√ºr Slavische Philologie, 1912, Vol XXXIII, pp. 618-22. as does also the Romanian Etymological Dictionary,Romanian Etymological Dictionary, CrƒÉciun tracing its roots back to the Latin creatio,-nis. However, most probably, this word is loanword with Slavic roots as in Romanian, as well as in Hungarian. Religious and mythological significance Koroƒçun or Kraƒçun was a pagan Slavic holiday. It was considered the day when the Black God and other spirits associated with decay and darkness were most potent. The first recorded usage of the term was in 1143, when the author of the Novgorod First Chronicle referred to the winter solstice as \\"Koroƒçun\\". It was celebrated by pagan Slavs on December 21, the longest night of the year and the night of the winter solstice. On this night, Hors, symbolizing old sun, becomes smaller as the days become shorter in the Northern Hemisphere, and dies on December 22, the winter solstice. It is said to be defeated by the dark and evil powers of the Black God. On December 23 Hors is resurrected and becomes the new sun, Koleda. Modern scholars tend to associate this holiday with ancestor worship. On this day Western Slavs lit fires at cemeteries to keep their loved ones warm, and organized feasts to honor the dead and keep them fed. They also lit wooden logs at local crossroads. In some Slavic languages, the word came to denote unexpected death of a young person and the evil spirit that shortens life.Max Vasmer, Etymological Dictionary of the Russian Language, –ö–æ—Ä–æ—á—É–Ω.

In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the dual graph of a plane graph is a graph that has a vertex for each face of . The dual graph has an edge whenever two faces of are separated from each other by an edge, and a self-loop when the same face appears on both sides of an edge. Thus, each edge of has a corresponding dual edge, whose endpoints are the dual vertices corresponding to the faces on either side of . The definition of the dual depends on the choice of embedding of the graph , so it is a property of plane graphs (graphs that are already embedded in the plane) rather than planar graphs (graphs that may be embedded but for which the embedding is not yet known). For planar graphs generally, there may be multiple dual graphs, depending on the choice of planar embedding of the graph. Historically, the first form of graph duality to be recognized was the association of the Platonic solids into pairs of dual polyhedra. Graph duality is a topological generalization of the geometric concepts of dual polyhedra and dual tessellations, and is in turn generalized algebraically by the concept of a dual matroid. Variations of planar graph duality include a version of duality for directed graphs, and duality for graphs embedded onto non-planar two-dimensional surfaces. However, these notions of dual graphs should not be confused with a different notion, the edge-to-vertex dual or line graph of a graph. The term dual is used because the property of being a dual graph is symmetric, meaning that if is a dual of a connected graph , then is a dual of . When discussing the dual of a graph , the graph itself may be referred to as the \\"primal graph\\". Many other graph properties and structures may be translated into other natural properties and structures of the dual. For instance, cycles are dual to cuts, spanning trees are dual to the complements of spanning trees, and simple graphs (without parallel edges or self-loops) are dual to 3-edge-connected graphs. Graph duality can help explain the structure of mazes and of drainage basins. Dual graphs have also been applied in computer vision, computational geometry, mesh generation, and the design of integrated circuits. Examples =Cycles and dipoles= The unique planar embedding of a cycle graph divides the plane into only two regions, the inside and outside of the cycle, by the Jordan curve theorem. However, in an -cycle, these two regions are separated from each other by different edges. Therefore, the dual graph of the -cycle is a multigraph with two vertices (dual to the regions), connected to each other by dual edges. Such a graph is called a dipole graph. Conversely, the dual to an -edge dipole graph is an -cycle.. =Dual polyhedra= The cube and regular octahedron are dual graphs of each other According to Steinitz's theorem, every polyhedral graph (the graph formed by the vertices and edges of a three- dimensional convex polyhedron) must be planar and 3-vertex-connected, and every 3-vertex-connected planar graph comes from a convex polyhedron in this way. Every three-dimensional convex polyhedron has a dual polyhedron; the dual polyhedron has a vertex for every face of the original polyhedron, with two dual vertices adjacent whenever the corresponding two faces share an edge. Whenever two polyhedra are dual, their graphs are also dual. For instance the Platonic solids come in dual pairs, with the octahedron dual to the cube, the dodecahedron dual to the icosahedron, and the tetrahedron dual to itself.. Polyhedron duality can also be extended to duality of higher dimensional polytopes,. but this extension of geometric duality does not have clear connections to graph-theoretic duality. =Self-dual graphs= A self-dual graph. A plane graph is said to be self-dual if it is isomorphic to its dual graph. The wheel graphs provide an infinite family of self-dual graphs coming from self-dual polyhedra (the pyramids). However, there also exist self-dual graphs that are not polyhedral, such as the one shown. describe two operations, adhesion and explosion, that can be used to construct a self-dual graph containing a given planar graph; for instance, the self-dual graph shown can be constructed as the adhesion of a tetrahedron with its dual.. It follows from Euler's formula that every self-dual graph with vertices has exactly edges.. Every simple self-dual planar graph contains at least four vertices of degree three, and every self-dual embedding has at least four triangular faces.See the proof of Theorem 5 in . Properties Many natural and important concepts in graph theory correspond to other equally natural but different concepts in the dual graph. Because the dual of the dual of a connected plane graph is isomorphic to the primal graph,. each of these pairings is bidirectional: if concept in a planar graph corresponds to concept in the dual graph, then concept in a planar graph corresponds to concept in the dual. =Simple graphs versus multigraphs= The dual of a simple graph need not be simple: it may have self-loops (an edge with both endpoints at the same vertex) or multiple edges connecting the same two vertices, as was already evident in the example of dipole multigraphs being dual to cycle graphs. As a special case of the cut-cycle duality discussed below, the bridges of a planar graph are in one-to-one correspondence with the self-loops of the dual graph.. For the same reason, a pair of parallel edges in a dual multigraph (that is, a length-2 cycle) corresponds to a 2-edge cutset in the primal graph (a pair of edges whose deletion disconnects the graph). Therefore, a planar graph is simple if and only if its dual has no 1- or 2-edge cutsets; that is, if it is 3-edge-connected. The simple planar graphs whose duals are simple are exactly the 3-edge-connected simple planar graphs.. This class of graphs includes, but is not the same as, the class of 3-vertex- connected simple planar graphs. For instance, the figure showing a self-dual graph is 3-edge-connected (and therefore its dual is simple) but is not 3-vertex-connected. =Uniqueness= Two red graphs are duals for the blue one, but they are not isomorphic. Because the dual graph depends on a particular embedding, the dual graph of a planar graph is not unique, in the sense that the same planar graph can have non-isomorphic dual graphs.. In the picture, the blue graphs are isomorphic but their dual red graphs are not. The upper red dual has a vertex with degree 6 (corresponding to the outer face of the blue graph) while in the lower red graph all degrees are less than 6. Hassler Whitney showed that if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the polyhedral graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected if and only if its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex- connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic. Because different embeddings may lead to different dual graphs, testing whether one graph is a dual of another (without already knowing their embeddings) is a nontrivial algorithmic problem. For biconnected graphs, it can be solved in polynomial time by using the SPQR trees of the graphs to construct a canonical form for the equivalence relation of having a shared mutual dual. For instance, the two red graphs in the illustration are equivalent according to this relation. However, for planar graphs that are not biconnected, this relation is not an equivalence relation and the problem of testing mutual duality is NP-complete.. =Cuts and cycles= A cutset in an arbitrary connected graph is a subset of edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint on each side of the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component.. A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle. In a connected planar graph , every simple cycle of corresponds to a minimal cutset in the dual of , and vice versa.. This can be seen as a form of the Jordan curve theorem: each simple cycle separates the faces of into the faces in the interior of the cycle and the faces of the exterior of the cycle, and the duals of the cycle edges are exactly the edges that cross from the interior to the exterior.. The girth of any planar graph (the size of its smallest cycle) equals the edge connectivity of its dual graph (the size of its smallest cutset). This duality extends from individual cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle space of a graph is defined as the family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it can be viewed as a vector space over the two- element finite field, with the symmetric difference of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut space of a graph is defined as the family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle space of any planar graph and the cut space of its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a planar graph (the dimension of its cut space) equals the cyclotomic number of its dual (the dimension of its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed in exactly one way as a symmetric difference of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory‚ÄìHu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle in the minimum weight cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one of the cuts in the Gomory‚ÄìHu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is still true that the Gomory‚ÄìHu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the minimum weight cycle bases of the graph.. In directed planar graphs, simple directed cycles are dual to directed cuts (partitions of the vertices into two subsets such that all edges go in one direction, from one subset to the other). Strongly oriented planar graphs (graphs whose underlying undirected graph is connected, and in which every edge belongs to a cycle) are dual to directed acyclic graphs in which no edge belongs to a cycle. To put this another way, the strong orientations of a connected planar graph (assignments of directions to the edges of the graph that result in a strongly connected graph) are dual to acyclic orientations (assignments of directions that produce a directed acyclic graph).. =Spanning trees= A simple maze in which the maze walls and the free space between the walls form two interdigitating trees A spanning tree may be defined as a set of edges that, together with all of the vertices of the graph, forms a connected and acyclic subgraph. But, by cut-cycle duality, if a set of edges in a planar graph is acyclic (has no cycles), then the set of edges dual to has no cuts, from which it follows that the complementary set of dual edges (the duals of the edges that are not in ) forms a connected subgraph. Symmetrically, if is connected, then the edges dual to the complement of form an acyclic subgraph. Therefore, when has both properties ‚Äì it is connected and acyclic ‚Äì the same is true for the complementary set in the dual graph. That is, each spanning tree of is complementary to a spanning tree of the dual graph, and vice versa. Thus, the edges of any planar graph and its dual can together be partitioned (in multiple different ways) into two spanning trees, one in the primal and one in the dual, that together extend to all the vertices and faces of the graph but never cross each other. In particular, the minimum spanning tree of is complementary to the maximum spanning tree of the dual graph.. However, this does not work for shortest path trees, even approximately: there exist planar graphs such that, for every pair of a spanning tree in the graph and a complementary spanning tree in the dual graph, at least one of the two trees has distances that are significantly longer than the distances in its graph.. An example of this type of decomposition into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls take the form of a mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph.. See in particular pp. 138‚Äì139. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.. This partition of the edges and their duals into two trees leads to a simple proof of Euler's formula for planar graphs with vertices, edges, and faces. Any spanning tree and its complementary dual spanning tree partition the edges into two subsets of and edges respectively, and adding the sizes of the two subsets gives the equation : which may be rearranged to form Euler's formula. According to Duncan Sommerville, this proof of Euler's formula is due to K. G. C. Von Staudt's Geometrie der Lage (N√ºrnberg, 1847).. In nonplanar surface embeddings the set of dual edges complementary to a spanning tree is not a dual spanning tree. Instead this set of edges is the union of a dual spanning tree with a small set of extra edges whose number is determined by the genus of the surface on which the graph is embedded. The extra edges, in combination with paths in the spanning trees, can be used to generate the fundamental group of the surface.. =Additional properties= Any counting formula involving vertices and faces that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula in which the roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides of the faces of the graph equals twice the number of edges.. The medial graph of a plane graph is isomorphic to the medial graph of its dual. Two planar graphs can have isomorphic medial graphs only if they are dual to each other.. A planar graph with four or more vertices is maximal (no more edges can be added while preserving planarity) if and only if its dual graph is both 3-vertex-connected and 3-regular.. A connected planar graph is Eulerian (has even degree at every vertex) if and only if its dual graph is bipartite. A Hamiltonian cycle in a planar graph corresponds to a partition of the vertices of the dual graph into two subsets (the interior and exterior of the cycle) whose induced subgraphs are both trees. In particular, Barnette's conjecture on the Hamiltonicity of cubic bipartite polyhedral graphs is equivalent to the conjecture that every Eulerian maximal planar graph can be partitioned into two induced trees.. If a planar graph has Tutte polynomial , then the Tutte polynomial of its dual graph is obtained by swapping and . For this reason, if some particular value of the Tutte polynomial provides information about certain types of structures in , then swapping the arguments to the Tutte polynomial will give the corresponding information for the dual structures. For instance, the number of strong orientations is and the number of acyclic orientations is .. For bridgeless planar graphs, graph colorings with colors correspond to nowhere- zero flows modulo on the dual graph. For instance, the four color theorem (the existence of a 4-coloring for every planar graph) can be expressed equivalently as stating that the dual of every bridgeless planar graph has a nowhere-zero 4-flow. The number of -colorings is counted (up to an easily computed factor) by the Tutte polynomial value and dually the number of nowhere-zero -flows is counted by . An st-planar graph is a connected planar graph together with a bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, both of which are required to be on the same face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph. Variations =Directed graphs= In a directed plane graph, the dual graph may be made directed as well, by orienting each dual edge by a 90¬∞ clockwise turn from the corresponding primal edge.. Strictly speaking, this construction is not a duality of directed planar graphs, because starting from a graph and taking the dual twice does not return to itself, but instead constructs a graph isomorphic to the transpose graph of , the graph formed from by reversing all of its edges. Taking the dual four times returns to the original graph. =Weak dual= The weak dual of a plane graph is the subgraph of the dual graph whose vertices correspond to the bounded faces of the primal graph. A plane graph is outerplanar if and only if its weak dual is a forest. For any plane graph , let be the plane multigraph formed by adding a single new vertex in the unbounded face of , and connecting to each vertex of the outer face (multiple times, if a vertex appears multiple times on the boundary of the outer face); then, is the weak dual of the (plane) dual of .. =Infinite graphs and tessellations= The concept of duality applies as well to infinite graphs embedded in the plane as it does to finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite planar graph embedding can also be viewed as a tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are disjoint open disks. Planar duality gives rise to the notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed by placing a vertex at the center of each tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles. A Voronoi diagram (red) and Delaunay triangulation (black) of a finite point set (the black points) The concept of a dual tessellation can also be applied to partitions of the plane into finitely many regions. It is closely related to but not quite the same as planar graph duality in this case. For instance, the Voronoi diagram of a finite set of point sites is a partition of the plane into polygons within which one site is closer than any other. The sites on the convex hull of the input give rise to unbounded Voronoi polygons, two of whose sides are infinite rays rather than finite line segments. The dual of this diagram is the Delaunay triangulation of the input, a planar graph that connects two sites by an edge whenever there exists a circle that contains those two sites and no other sites. The edges of the convex hull of the input are also edges of the Delaunay triangulation, but they correspond to rays rather than line segments of the Voronoi diagram. This duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations can be turned into a duality between finite graphs in either of two ways: by adding an artificial vertex at infinity to the Voronoi diagram, to serve as the other endpoint for all of its rays,. or by treating the bounded part of the Voronoi diagram as the weak dual of the Delaunay triangulation. Although the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation are dual, their embedding in the plane may have additional crossings beyond the crossings of dual pairs of edges. Each vertex of the Delaunay triangle is positioned within its corresponding face of the Voronoi diagram. Each vertex of the Voronoi diagram is positioned at the circumcenter of the corresponding triangle of the Delaunay triangulation, but this point may lie outside its triangle. =Nonplanar embeddings= The concept of duality can be extended to graph embeddings on two-dimensional manifolds other than the plane. The definition is the same: there is a dual vertex for each connected component of the complement of the graph in the manifold, and a dual edge for each graph edge connecting the two dual vertices on either side of the edge. In most applications of this concept, it is restricted to embeddings with the property that each face is a topological disk; this constraint generalizes the requirement for planar graphs that the graph be connected. With this constraint, the dual of any surface-embedded graph has a natural embedding on the same surface, such that the dual of the dual is isomorphic to and isomorphically embedded to the original graph. For instance, the complete graph is a toroidal graph: it is not planar but can be embedded in a torus, with each face of the embedding being a triangle. This embedding has the Heawood graph as its dual graph.. The same concept works equally well for non- orientable surfaces. For instance, can be embedded in the projective plane with ten triangular faces as the hemi-icosahedron, whose dual is the Petersen graph embedded as the hemi-dodecahedron.. Even planar graphs may have nonplanar embeddings, with duals derived from those embeddings that differ from their planar duals. For instance, the four Petrie polygons of a cube (hexagons formed by removing two opposite vertices of the cube) form the hexagonal faces of an embedding of the cube in a torus. The dual graph of this embedding has four vertices forming a complete graph with doubled edges. In the torus embedding of this dual graph, the six edges incident to each vertex, in cyclic order around that vertex, cycle twice through the three other vertices. In contrast to the situation in the plane, this embedding of the cube and its dual is not unique; the cube graph has several other torus embeddings, with different duals. Many of the equivalences between primal and dual graph properties of planar graphs fail to generalize to nonplanar duals, or require additional care in their generalization. Another operation on surface-embedded graphs is the Petrie dual, which uses the Petrie polygons of the embedding as the faces of a new embedding. Unlike the usual dual graph, it has the same vertices as the original graph, but generally lies on a different surface. Surface duality and Petrie duality are two of the six Wilson operations, and together generate the group of these operations. =Matroids and algebraic duals= An algebraic dual of a connected graph is a graph such that and have the same set of edges, any cycle of is a cut of , and any cut of is a cycle of . Every planar graph has an algebraic dual, which is in general not unique (any dual defined by a plane embedding will do). The converse is actually true, as settled by Hassler Whitney in Whitney's planarity criterion:. : A connected graph is planar if and only if it has an algebraic dual. The same fact can be expressed in the theory of matroids. If is the graphic matroid of a graph , then a graph is an algebraic dual of if and only if the graphic matroid of is the dual matroid of . Then Whitney's planarity criterion can be rephrased as stating that the dual matroid of a graphic matroid is itself a graphic matroid if and only if the underlying graph of is planar. If is planar, the dual matroid is the graphic matroid of the dual graph of . In particular, all dual graphs, for all the different planar embeddings of , have isomorphic graphic matroids.. For nonplanar surface embeddings, unlike planar duals, the dual graph is not generally an algebraic dual of the primal graph. And for a non-planar graph , the dual matroid of the graphic matroid of is not itself a graphic matroid. However, it is still a matroid whose circuits correspond to the cuts in , and in this sense can be thought of as a generalized algebraic dual of .. The duality between Eulerian and bipartite planar graphs can be extended to binary matroids (which include the graphic matroids derived from planar graphs): a binary matroid is Eulerian if and only if its dual matroid is bipartite.. The two dual concepts of girth and edge connectivity are unified in matroid theory by matroid girth: the girth of the graphic matroid of a planar graph is the same as the graph's girth, and the girth of the dual matroid (the graphic matroid of the dual graph) is the edge connectivity of the graph.. Applications Along with its use in graph theory, the duality of planar graphs has applications in several other areas of mathematical and computational study. In geographic information systems, flow networks (such as the networks showing how water flows in a system of streams and rivers) are dual to cellular networks describing drainage divides. This duality can be explained by modeling the flow network as a spanning tree on a grid graph of an appropriate scale, and modeling the drainage divide as the complementary spanning tree of ridgelines on the dual grid graph.. In computer vision, digital images are partitioned into small square pixels, each of which has its own color. The dual graph of this subdivision into squares has a vertex per pixel and an edge between pairs of pixels that share an edge; it is useful for applications including clustering of pixels into connected regions of similar colors.. In computational geometry, the duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations implies that any algorithm for constructing a Voronoi diagram can be immediately converted into an algorithm for the Delaunay triangulation, and vice versa.. The same duality can also be used in finite element mesh generation. Lloyd's algorithm, a method based on Voronoi diagrams for moving a set of points on a surface to more evenly spaced positions, is commonly used as a way to smooth a finite element mesh described by the dual Delaunay triangulation. This method improves the mesh by making its triangles more uniformly sized and shaped.. In the synthesis of CMOS circuits, the function to be synthesized is represented as a formula in Boolean algebra. Then this formula is translated into two series-parallel multigraphs. These graphs can be interpreted as circuit diagrams in which the edges of the graphs represent transistors, gated by the inputs to the function. One circuit computes the function itself, and the other computes its complement. One of the two circuits is derived by converting the conjunctions and disjunctions of the formula into series and parallel compositions of graphs, respectively. The other circuit reverses this construction, converting the conjunctions and disjunctions of the formula into parallel and series compositions of graphs.. These two circuits, augmented by an additional edge connecting the input of each circuit to its output, are planar dual graphs.. History The duality of convex polyhedra was recognized by Johannes Kepler in his 1619 book Harmonices Mundi.. Recognizable planar dual graphs, outside the context of polyhedra, appeared as early as 1725, in Pierre Varignon's posthumously published work, Nouvelle M√©chanique ou Statique. This was even before Leonhard Euler's 1736 work on the Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg that is often taken to be the first work on graph theory. Varignon analyzed the forces on static systems of struts by drawing a graph dual to the struts, with edge lengths proportional to the forces on the struts; this dual graph is a type of Cremona diagram.. See also . In connection with the four color theorem, the dual graphs of maps (subdivisions of the plane into regions) were mentioned by Alfred Kempe in 1879, and extended to maps on non-planar surfaces by in 1891.. Duality as an operation on abstract planar graphs was introduced by Hassler Whitney in 1931..

It was intended to be a comedic critique of the post-war settlement of Europe following the Congress of Vienna and the large number of British and Irish families who flocked to France for tourism. It was inspired in part by a brief trip that Moore had made to Paris. It depicts the visit to Paris of the fictional Fudge family in the wake of the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the restoration of the Bourbon regime. The story is told through the letters of four characters: the father Phil Fudge, his children Bob and Biddy and the family tutor Phelim Connor. Phil is in the city researching a book which he intends to be propaganda on behalf of his patron Lord Castlereagh, the foreign secretary. His son is a dandy mainly interested in the city's restaurants while his dizzy daughter is seeking romance. She falls in love with a young man who she believes to be the King of Prussia in disguise, but is in fact a draper. It was published on 20 April 1818 by Longmans.

Part of the Western Reserve Historical Society and housed at the Cleveland History Center, it was founded by industrialist Frederick C. Crawford of TRW, and opened in 1965. The collection began as the Thompson Products Auto Album, which was also founded by Crawford. Crawford explained that when he started collecting the cars, it was simply because it seemed a shame to let them be scrapped, which was the typical fate of almost all antique machinery at the time. He saw value in saving a few historically significant examples. Its eclectic collection of historic vehicles includes (as of 2019) more than 170 automobiles, 12 aircraft, 3 antique carriages and sleighs, and 21 non-car artifacts (motorcycles, boats and bicycles). The facility includes more than 2000 square feet of archival collections. The aviation collection includes a P-51 Mustang racing plane used in Thompson Trophy Races. The oldest car in the collection is an 1897 Panhard et Levassor, while more recent acquisitions include a 1981 DeLorean and a Self-driving car named DEXTER which was team Team Case's entry in the DARPA Urban Challenge 2007, in which it placed in the top 20. In 2016, the museum's 1913 ALCO Model Six Berline Limousine won the Ansel Adams Award at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in California, one of the country's most prestigious auto shows. The Ansel Adams Award is given to the most desirable touring car at the show.

Biography Boisard was a French fabulist born in 1743 in Caen, a historical town located in Normandy, North-West France, about 150 kilometers from Paris. Educated by his family to be a member of the local Bar, he was appointed Secretary of the Finance Council and, in 1778, Secretary of the Chancery of \\"Monsieur\\", namely the elder brother of the king of France. With the French Revolution, he lost his post and, later on, the modest pension allocated to it. As a member of the Royal Academy of Literature (Acad√©mie royale des Belles-lettres) of Caen, the first academy established in France after the \\"Acad√©mie fran√ßaise\\", he started publishing fables in 1764 in the Mercure de France. Fables were very popular in the French literature of the 18th century, the Age of Enlightenment, under the shadow of Jean de La Fontaine. In 1771, the publisher Lottin published the Fablier fran√ßais, which was a compilation of texts from some hundred authors who wrote fables, since La Fontaine. This literary art dates back, at least, to Greek antiquity. Fables were usually written in verses and used animals for their symbolic value. They carry implicit or explicit messages of moral philosophy. Facing problems due to his antirevolutionary ideas against the Republic, Boisard left Paris and returned to Caen. The city was incidentally a centre of \\"federalist\\" insurgents against the revolutionary government. One of its citizens, Charlotte Corday, in 1793, murdered a prominent leader of the Revolution, Jean Paul Marat. Boisard was, at this time, apparently not involved in politics. Up to 1805, he published several collections of fables and various works. The richness of his imagination was matchless. At the time, he was recognized as a very respectable author. Beside the fables, he wrote some light poetry and translated several poems of Horace. Voltaire praised him, Diderot (Epitre √† Boisard) dedicated one of his very few rhymed Epistle to the fabulist: \\"nobody has been such a charming rhyme writer ... Nobody has been such a perfect rhyme writer\\" (\\"Oncques ne fut un rimeur si charmant ... Oncques ne fut un rimeur si parfait\\"). It must be noticed however that modern literary critics are now of the opinion that this epistle may have been addressed to his nephew (mentioned below) since it implicitly refers to a bad fortune. For his part, Jacob Grimm, who was a close friend, considered Boisard's fables as natural and diverse, but sometimes na√Øve. He was quite laudatory in writing that Boisard was the fabulist who imitated the less La Fontaine, but came the closest to the master. The polemical writer Antoine de Rivarol was sarcastic in stating that Boisard's fables \\"have outmoded those of La Fontaine, which is always somewhat unfair\\" (\\"ont fait passer de mode celles de La Fontaine, ce qui est toujours un peu injuste!\\") Boisard is one of the most prolific authors of French literature. His publications were produced over a period of 33 years (1773 to 1806). Presently, he is broadly considered as the best fabulist after La Fontaine, although his literary style, pleasant and light but sometimes inelegant, is certainly not of the same standard. In 1806, Mille et une fables (A Thousand and One Fables) was published as a compilation of at least five former editions. It was a bulky and sumptuously printed and illustrated publication, which does not seem to be available now. As with hundreds of French fabulists of that time, except La Fontaine, the work of Boisard did not really survive as centuries passed. Boisard also produced a lyrical poem, \\"Ode sur le d√©luge\\", which was crowned, in 1790, by the Academy of Rouen. Boisard died in his home town of Caen in 1831 or 1833.

Born in Oxford, Holton played as a full back for non-league Oxford City as a youth, before joining Arsenal in October 1947 at the age of 18. He spent three seasons in Arsenal's' reserve team, eventually converting to a centre forward, although his progress was restricted in part by National Service. He made his debut against Stoke City on 26 December 1950; initially a bit-part player, he became an established regular in the side in 1951‚Äì52 and remained there for three seasons. He was in the Arsenal side to reach the FA Cup Final in 1952. With 22 goals (19 of them in the league) he helped Arsenal to a First Division title in 1952‚Äì53. However, he lost his place in the Arsenal side in 1954‚Äì55, before returning the following season (1955‚Äì56), having been converted into a utility man ‚Äì playing in defence, midfield or up front. He continued to figure for Arsenal for another three seasons and on 6 October 1956, he scored four goals in a home match against Manchester City, becoming the first player since Jack Lambert to score more than three in a game at Highbury. In all he scored 88 goals in 217 matches for Arsenal. Although he was often tipped for an England place, he never won a cap for his country. Holton was sold to Watford in October 1958 for ¬£9,000, a somewhat surprising move, considering Watford were in the newly formed Fourth Division at the time. Holton spent three seasons with the Hornets, mostly at centre forward. He formed a successful partnership with Dennis Uphill, scoring a club record 48 goals in 1959‚Äì60, which also saw the club promoted to the Third Division. Holton was then controversially sold to Northampton Town in 1961 where he scored a club record 36 goals in 1961‚Äì62, thus achieving the rare feat of holding the all-time goals in a season record at two different clubs. Holton went on to play for Crystal Palace, signing in December 1962 and was part of the Palace side which achieved promotion to the second tier in 1964, with 43 appearances that season scoring 20 goals. He then signed for Watford (for a second time) on 6 May 1965, before moving on to Charlton Athletic (in a deal which saw Stewart Scullion move in the opposite direction) and subsequently Leyton Orient. He finally retired in 1968, due in part to a knee injury, and left the game completely to take up a career in engineering. He died suddenly while on holiday in 1996, at the age of 67.

Family and early life Pap was the son born to the Arsacid monarch Arsaces II (Arshak II) and his wife Pharantzem (P'arandzem), who was his third known wife. Prior to his father's Armenian kingship, Arsaces II married an unnamed woman who appeared to have died before the year 358 by whom he had a son called Anob,According to Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the priest & historiographer of the Catholicos Nerses the Great, gives the name Anob as the father of Pap‚Äôs nephew Varasdates (Varazdat). Also according to the Epic Histories attributed to P'avstos (Faustus) Buzand, Varasdates proclaims himself as the nephew of Pap thus was Pap's older paternal half-brother. The father of Pap served as Roman Client King of Armenia from 350 until 368. Pap is the only known child born to Arsaces II during his Armenian Kingship. He was born and raised in Armenia and little is known on his early life. Armenian historian of the 5th century Faustus of Byzantium in his writings History of the Armenians (Book IV, Chapter 15), states that the parents of Pap nourished him during his childhood and when he reached puberty he became robust. St. Nerses I Namesake Pap was named in honor of Pap, a brief Catholicos in 348 who was Pap's late paternal relative and the first son of Saint Husik. Saint Husik was the grandfather of the Catholicos, St. Nerses I.The Armenian Church ‚Äì Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin: Establishment of the Armenian Church Ascendancy to the throne During Sassanid King Shapur II's invasion of the Kingdom of Armenia, Pharantzem and Pap were holed up with the Armenian treasure in the fortress of Artogerassa defended by a troop of Azats. According to Ammianus Marcellinus, the Persian invasion force was commanded by two Armenian defectors, Cylaces (Glak) and Artabanes (Vahan). Shapur II's intention was to replace the Armenian Arsacid monarchy with a non-Arsacid but still Armenian nakharar diarchy. Faustus of Byzantium in his Epic Histories also mentions two Armenian nakharars, Meruzhan Artsruni and Vahan Mamikonian in leadership positions under Shapur II's suzerainty as well as Zik and Karen who carried Persian noble titles. This also implies that Shapur II might have intended to combine Sassanid administrative rule (Zik and Karen) with that of nakharar rule (Artsruni and Mamikonian). During the siege, Arsaces II's wife Pharantzem appealed to Cylaces and Artabanes in the name of her husband who defected back to the Arsacid monarchy and engineered the escape of Pap. Themistius reported of Pap's arrival at Valens' court in Marcianopolis where the Emperor was wintering. Valens bade him to stay at Neocaesarea in Pontus Polemoniacus three hundred kilometers from the Armenian border. In 369, Pap returned to Armenian territory at the request of the nobility. He was accompanied by the comes et dux Terentius but was not yet endowed with a royal rank. King of Armenia Valens was reluctant to bestow a royal title upon Pap in order not to violate an earlier treaty signed by Jovian in July 363. Valens dispatched his magister peditum praesentalis Arinthaeus to Armenia just as Shapur II invaded the country in pursuit of Pap who was hiding near the Roman frontier in Lazica. Meanwhile, Terentius restored Sauromaces to the throne of Iberia, but the king appointed by the Persians, Aspacures retained control of the eastern part of that kingdom. Instead of going after Pap, Shapur II concentrated his attack on the now long besieged fortress of Artogerassa which fell in the winter of 370, the royal treasure was captured by the Persians and Pharantzem, raped and murdered. Shapur II also began systematically persecuting the local Christians by forcing apostasy to Mazdaism, a form of Orthodox Zoroastrianism. Shapur II contacted Pap who was still in hiding and tried to persuade him to come over to his side. Under Shapur II's influence Pap murdered the duplicitous Cylaces and Artabanes and sent their heads to the shahanshah as a sign of loyalty. In the spring of 370 Shapur II prepared a massive invasion of Armenia which was realized in the spring of 371. Valens' generals Traianus and Vadomarius met the Persian force in Armenia at Bagrevand not far from the village called Dzirav and came off victorious. Faustus of Byzantium gives considerable credit for the victory to sparapet Mushegh I Mamikonian. Moses of Chorene of Armenia and Roman Ammianus Marcellinus noted that the Valens' generals did not participate in the battle actively but rather were engaged in protecting the King. During the ensuing battles more Armenian territories were reclaimed from the Persians, including Arzanene and Corduene which were ceded to Persians by Jovian in 363. By the end of the summer Shapur II retreated to his capital at Ctesiphon and Valens went back to Antioch. Shapur II was unable to confront the massive Roman build up in Armenia as a result of his preoccupation with Kushan attacks in the eastern realm of his empire. While peace prevailed with Persia, the situation inside Armenia began to crumble. Fall Pap, like his father, aggressively pursued a policy of Christian Arianism.Terian, Patriotism And Piety In Armenian Christianity: The Early Panegyrics On Saint Gregory, p.18 He was struggling to rule a kingdom that was recently dismantled by Shapur II; his actions to keep a tight grip on power led to his downfall. Pap poisoned the popular Armenian Catholicos Nerses in 373, who was a very close Roman ally. The poisoning of Nerses was one of the measures that Pap took to restrain the excessive power of the Church, which included the confiscation of rich estates which were attached to the Holy See. Pap had nominated a certain Husik as a replacement and sent him for consecration in Caesarea. The bishop of Caesarea Basil refused to consecrate the nominee but Valens requested that Basil quickly resolve the situation by finding a new nominee acceptable to Pap. Basil failed to do so and the Roman see of Caesarea effectively lost its traditional role of consecrating the Catholicos of Armenia. Pap's refusal to cooperate with Basil angered Valens. In addition, Pap demanded control over Caesarea and twelve other Roman cities including Edessa as former Arsacid domains while openly courting Persia. Valens decided to execute Pap and invited him to a meeting in Tarsus. Pap arrived with 300 mounted escorts but quickly became anxious when he found out the Emperor was not there in person, fleeing back to Armenia.Ammianus Marcellinus. The Later Roman Empire: A.D. 354-378. London: Penguin Classics, 1986, pp. 387-388. . Terentius sent two generals with scutarii (shielded cavalry) familiar with the local terrain after Pap, an Armenian named Danielus and an Iberian named Barzimeres who failed to capture and execute Pap. Both generals gave an excuse that Pap had used magical powers to avoid capture and used a dark cloud to mask his party. Faustus in his Epic Histories also claimed that Pap was possessed by devs (demons). This could have simply been an attack against Pap's sympathies towards Arians and pagans. Valens then assigned Traianus to gain Pap's confidence and murder him. Traianus murdered Pap in 374 during a banquet which he had organized for the young king.Sargsyan, Gagik. ¬´’ä’°’∫¬ª [Pap]. Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia. Yerevan: Armenian National Academy of Sciences, vol. 9, 1983, pp. 128-29. Marcellinus Ammianus drew parallels between the treacherous murder of the Quadi King Gabinius by Valentinian I and the murder of Pap by Valens,Ammianus Marcellinus, Roman Empire, p. 387. who also wrote that the murder of Pap haunted Valens prior to the Battle of Adrianople. The Armenian nakharars still loyal to Pap did little to protest as a result of a large Roman army present in Armenian territory. The new Roman nominee for a king was accepted virtually by everyone. It was another Arsacid and nephew of Pap, who grew up in Rome named Varasdates (Varazdat) that began to rule under the regency of Mushegh Mamikonian. The Mamikonians were notoriously pro-Roman. Shapur II had long been courting Pap and he was infuriated when Pap was murdered and a new Arsacid placed on the Armenian throne instead. Marriage and issue Pap married an Armenian noblewoman called Zarmandukht, who through marriage became queen consort of Armenia.Kurkjian, A History of Armenia, p. 266. Zarmandukht bore Pap two sons:Epic Histories, Book 5.37. Arsaces III (Arshak III) and Vologases.

Bandhani is also known as Bandhej Saree, Bandhni, Piliya, and Chungidi in Tamil and regional dialects. Other tying techniques include Mothra, Ekdali and Shikari depending on the manner in which the cloth is tied.

Group of women dressed in Bandhani Sari c. 1855-1862. The art of Bandhani is a highly skilled process. The technique involves dyeing a fabric which is tied tightly with a thread at several points, thus producing a variety of patterns like Chandrakala, Bavan Baug, Shikari etcetera; depending on the manner in which the cloth is tied. The main colour used in Bandhana are yellow, red, blue, green and black. The main colours used in Bandhana are natural. As Bandhani is a tie and dye process, dying is done by hand and hence best colours and combinations are possible in Bandhanis. The Bandhani work has been exclusively carried out by the Khatri community of Kutchh and Saurashtra. A meter length of cloth can have thousands of tiny knots known as 'Bheendi' in the local language ('Gujarati'). These knots form a design once opened after dyeing in bright colours. Traditionally, the final products can be classified into 'khombhi', 'Ghar Chola', 'Chandrakhani', 'Shikari', 'Chowkidaar', 'Ambadaal' and other categories. Bandhani work is also done in Rajasthan, where different colours and designs are used than the Kutch and Saurashtra regions of Gujarat. Establishments of varying sizes in the entire Kutch belt in Gujarat produce many varieties of Bandhani. This Bandhani style is called as the Kutchi Bandhani. Bandhani tying is often a family trade, and the women of these families work at home to tie patterns. Pethapur, Mandavi, Bhuj, Anjar, Jetpur, Jamnagar, Rajkot, are some of the main towns in Gujarat, where Bandhani is created. The city of Bhuj in Gujarat is well known for its red Bandhani. Dyeing process of Bandhani is carried out extensively in this city, as the water of this area is known to give a particular brightness to colours, specifically reds and maroons. As with other Indian textiles, in Bandhani too different colours convey different meanings. People believe that red is an auspicious colours for brides.

Roger Luce, the station's morning host, said at the time, \\"I've never seen this in 22 years at this radio station... Whatever that was - it was very racist.\\"Aircheck of the WBAB Signal Intrusion The next morning, it made the front page of Newsday with the headline \\"JACKED FM\\". The station's new general manager, John Shea, said, \\"I've only been here a week and we get hijacked.\\" Former program director John Olsen said, \\"This was not some child's prank, this was a federal offense.\\" The hijack was likely accomplished by overpowering the studio transmitter link (STL) signal to the transmitter in Dix Hills, New York. A signal hijacking with the same song happened to WBAB's sister station WBLI about two weeks earlier.

He was, for many years, secretary in the service of the prince of Salerno, and his wife Porzia de Rossi was closely connected with the most illustrious Neapolitan families. Their son, the great poet Torquato Tasso, was born at Sorrento in 1544. During the boy's childhood the prince of Salerno came into collision with the Spanish government of Naples, was outlawed, and was deprived of his hereditary fiefs. Tasso shared in this disaster of his patron. He and his son were proclaimed rebels to the state. Bernardo moved to Rome where his son joined him in about 1552. In 1556 news came that Porzia had died, and Bernardo suspected her brother of poisoning her with the object of getting control over her property. As it subsequently happened, Porzia's estate never descended to her son; and the daughter Cornelia married below her birth, at the instigation of her maternal relatives. He served various noblemen then, among them duke Guidobaldo II, in whose court his son Torquato was educated. When Bernardo was serving the duke of Milan, Guglielmo Gonzaga, he was appointed governor of Ostiglia. When, therefore, an opening at the court of Urbino was offered in 1557, Bernardo Tasso gladly accepted it. He read cantos of his Amadigi to the duchess and her ladies, or discussed the merits of Homer and Virgil, Trissino and Ariosto, with the duke's librarians and secretaries. He also traveled to Venice to superintend the printing of the Amadigi. Bernardo Tasso died in Ostiglia, then part of the Duchy of Mantua. Work An author of diverse works, Tasso wrote psalms, eclogues, sonnets and odes. The latter were the first Italian poems written in the manner of Horace. His lyric poems were published with the title Amori in Venice (1555). His main work, L'Amadigi, is an epic poem divided in 100 cantos and inspired by the Spanish chivalric romance Amadis de Gaula (known in fragmentary form since the 14th century; first printed in its entirety in 1508). The Amadigi was left incomplete but was later completed by his son Torquato, who published the full text under the title Floridante in 1587.

Carlson et al., ‚ÄúMor Gabriel ‚Äî ‹ï‹ù‹™‹ê ‹ï‹©‹™‹õ‹°‹ù‹¢ ‚Äù in The Syriac Gazetteer last modified February 6, 2014, http://syriaca.org/place/226., also known as Deyrulumur, is the oldest surviving Syriac Orthodox monastery in the world. It is located on the Tur Abdin plateau near Midyat in the Mardin Province in southeastern Turkey. It has been involved in a dispute with the Turkish government that threatened its existence. History The functional main accommodation block of Dayro d-Mor Gabriel, emphasising its role as a working community Dayro d-Mor Gabriel was founded in 397 by the ascetic Mor Shmu'el (Samuel) and his student Mor Shem'un (Simon). According to tradition, Shem'un had a dream in which an Angel commanded him to build a House of Prayer in a location marked with three large stone blocks. When Shem'un awoke, he took his teacher to the place and found the stone the angel had placed. At this spot Mor Gabriel Monastery built. The monastery's importance grew and by the 6th century there were over 1000 local and Coptic monks there. The monastery became so famous that it received contributions from Roman Emperors, such as Arcadius, Honorius, Theodosius II and Anastasius. Between 615 and 1049 the Episcopal seat of Tur Abdin was based here and from 1049 until 1915 the monastery had its own diocese. In the 7th century, the monastery became known as Monastery of St Gabriel, who was famous for his ascetic life. In the fourteenth century four hundred and forty monks were killed by invading Mongols. In 1991, the remains of monks killed by Timur (Tamerlane) were found in caves underneath the monastery, dated to the year 1401. During the Assyrian Genocide the monks were massacred by Kurds and the monastery was occupied for four years until returned to the church in 1919. The monastery is an important center for the Syrian Christians of Tur Abdin with around fifteen nuns and two monks occupying separate wings, as well as a fluctuating number of local lay workers and guests from overseas. It maintained a significant library however, almost nothing remains. The monastery is currently the seat of the metropolitan bishop of Tur Abdin. In its history the monastery has produced many high-ranking clerics and scholars, among them, four patriarchs, a Maphrian and 84 bishops. Dayro d-Mor Gabriel is a working community set amongst gardens and orchards, and somewhat disfigured by 1960s residential accommodation. The monastery's primary purpose is to keep Syriac Orthodox Christianity alive in the land of its birth by providing schooling, ordination of native-born monks. On occasions it has provided physical protection to the Christian population. Dayro d-Mor Gabriel is open to visitors, and it is possible to stay with permission, but is closed after dark. Legal disputes  In the last decade the monastery has been involved in a land dispute with the Turkish government and Kurdish village leaders, particularly those linked to the √áelebi tribe, backed by local representatives of the ruling Justice and Development Party. In 2008 the villages Eƒülence, √áandarlƒ± and Yayvantepe as well as the Turkish Land Registry and the Office Forestry Ministry filed legal proceeding disputing the territory of the monastery. The monastery won the legal dispute against the villages but lost to the Turkish authorities which resulted in a loss of territory ownership of 60%, which led the monastery to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Turkish government assistance to the Kurds is seen as retaliation against the Syriac diaspora for lobbying for international recognition of the killings of tens of thousands of Syriacs during World War I as genocide. Their attempts to confiscate land owned by the monastery has garnered attention from many European governments and gathered opposition to Turkey's EU bid, and could be the basis of a case by the monastery at the ECHR. Otmar Oehring from Missio, a German Catholic charity, has said that the cases mean that ‚Äúthe state's actions suggest it wishes that the monastery no longer existed.‚Äù There have also been claims that the monastery was built on the grounds of a previous mosque, regardless of the fact that the monastery was founded over 170 years prior to the birth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. On 26 January 2011, the Turkish supreme court granted substantial parts of the Monastery to the Turkish Treasury. The ruling was that land inside and adjacent to the monastery, which the monastery has owned for decades and has paid taxes for, belongs to the State. On June 13, 2012 the Turkish supreme court of appeals upheld this decision, which Assyrians continued to protest.Turkey‚Äôs Arameans press for rights to Mor Gabriel despite setbacks , YONCA POYRAZ DOƒûAN, Today's Zaman, 10 July 2012 The then Turkish prime minister Erdoƒüan announced on 30 September 2013 that the land would be returned to the Syriac community in Turkey.

It was composed during the closing months of the Second World War, from August 1944 to March 1945. The piece was commissioned by Paul Sacher, the founder and director of the Basler Kammerorchester and Collegium Musicum Z√ºrich, to whom Strauss dedicated it. It was first performed on 25 January 1946 by Sacher and the Collegium Musicum Z√ºrich, with Strauss conducting the final rehearsal. Composition history By 1944, Strauss was in poor health and needed to visit the Swiss spa at Baden near Z√ºrich. But he was unable to get the Nazi government's permission to travel abroad. Karl B√∂hm, Paul Sacher and Willi Schuh came up with a plan to get the travel permit: a commission from Sacher and invitation to the premiere in Zurich. The commission was made in a letter by B√∂hm on August 28, 1944, for a \\"suite for strings\\". Strauss replied that he had been working for some time on an adagio for 11 strings. In fact, his early work on Metamorphosen was for a septet (2 violins, 2 violas, 2 cellos and a bass). The starting date for the score is given as 13 March 1945, which suggests that the destruction of the Vienna opera house the previous day gave Strauss the impetus to finish the work and draw together his previous sketches in just one month (finished on 12 April 1945). As with his other late works, Strauss builds the music from a series of small melodic ideas \\"which are the point of departure for the development of the entire composition.\\" In this unfolding of ideas \\"Strauss applies here all of the rhetorical means developed over the centuries to express pain.\\" But he also alternates passages in a major key expressing hope and optimism with passages of sadness, as in the finales of both Gustav Mahler's 6th Symphony and Tchaikovsky's 6th symphony. The overall structure of the piece is \\"a slow introduction, a quick central section, and a return to the initial slower tempo\\", which echoes the structure of Death and Transfiguration. There are five basic thematic elements in Metamorphosen. First, there are the opening chords. Second, there is the repetition of three short notes followed by a fourth long note. Third, there is the direct quote from bar 3 of the Marcia Funebre from Beethoven's Eroica Symphony. Fourth, there is a minor theme with triplets. Fifth, there is the lyrical theme \\"that becomes the source of much of the contrasting music in major, sunnier keys.\\" The second theme does not stand on its own, but precedes the third and fourth themes. Its most obvious source is Beethoven's 5th Symphony, for example the short-short-short-long repetition of G played by the horns in the third movement. But it has other progenitors: the Finale of Mozart's Jupiter Symphony (a personal favorite of Strauss as a conductor) and the Fugue from Bach's Solo Violin Sonata in G minor BWV 1001. Strauss also used it in the Oboe Concerto, written only a few months after Metamorphosen, displaying \\"a remarkable example of the thematic links between the last instrumental works\\". He had also used this motif over 60 years before in his 1881 Piano Sonata. At the end of Metamorphosen, Strauss quotes the first four bars of the Eroica's Marcia Funebre with the annotation \\"IN MEMORIAM!\\" at the bottom. Metamorphosen exhibits the complex counterpoint for which Strauss showed a predilection throughout his life. Metamorphosen and the Munich Memorial Waltz One of the pieces Strauss had been working on before Metamorphosen was the orchestral movement Munich Memorial Waltz, sketches of which appear in the same notebook in which Strauss began sketches for Metamorphosen. The Munich Memorial Waltz has a different time signature (Metamorphosen is in 4/4) and is based on different thematic material, including a waltz and other themes from the opera Feuersnot relating to fire. In fact the Munich Waltz is mainly based on music Strauss wrote for a 1939 film about Munich, which has been called a Gelegenheitswalzer (\\"Occasional Waltz\\") and premiered on 24 May 1939. In late 1944 and 1945 Strauss sketched some music in waltz time described in his sketchbook as Trauer um M√ºnchen (\\"Mourning for Munich\\"). This music was eventually combined with the 1939 piece as a middle section, headed \\"Minore - In Memoriam\\". The new piece was finished on 24 February 1945, and the subtitle Gelegenheitswaltzer was replaced with Ged√§chtniswalzer (\\"Memorial Waltz\\"). The Munich Memorial Waltz (TrV 274a and AV 140) lasts about 9 minutes, and was first published and performed in 1951. Timothy L. Jackson believes that scholars who interpret the early sketches of M√ºnchen as the origin of Metamorphosen have a weak, even untenable case. Interpretations Strauss himself never commented on Metamorphosen's meaning, beyond the title (which means \\"changes\\" or \\"transformations\\"). The title does not seem to refer to the musical treatment of the themes, \\"since within the piece itself the themes never do undergo metamorphosis ... but rather a continuous symphonic development.\\" It has been widely believed that Strauss wrote the work as a statement of mourning for Germany's destruction during the war, in particular as an elegy for the devastating bombing of Munich, especially places such as the Munich Opera House. The use of the term \\"In Memoriam\\" may well echo his use of the same term in the Munich Memorial Waltz, where it is clearly related to Munich. Juergen May believes that the piece is a musical monument to culture in general, \\"more than three thousand years of humankind's cultural development\\". A few days after finishing Metamorphosen, Strauss wrote in his diary: :The most terrible period of human history is at an end, the twelve year reign of bestiality, ignorance and anti-culture under the greatest criminals, during which Germany's 2,000 years of cultural evolution met its doom. There has been speculation about other interpretations. Jackson concludes that Metamorphosen is a philosophical, Goethean study of the underlying cause of war in general, humankind's bestial nature . In his view Metamorphosen uses the classical concept of metamorphosis as a process of transcending from the mundane into the divine, but inverts it such that the outcome of metamorphosis is not an attainment of the divine but rather a descent into bestiality. Michael Kennedy also develops the view that Strauss's chronological rereading of Goethe during 1944 was a crucial influence. He quotes Strauss as telling a visitor: \\"I am reading him as he developed and as he finally became...Now that I am old myself I will be young again with Goethe and then again old with him‚Äîwith his eyes. For he was a man of eyes‚Äîhe saw what I heard.\\" At the same time as he was starting sketches for Metamorphosen Strauss was working on a sketch for choir based on the following verses of Goethe (from Zahme Xenien (VII), 1827, see translations in and ). > Niemand wird sich selber kennen, > Sich von seinem Selbst-Ich trennen; > Doch probier' er jeden Tag, > Was nach au√üen endlich, klar, > Was er ist und was er war, > Was er kann und was er mag. > > Wie's aber in der Welt zugeht, > Eigentlich niemand recht versteht, > Und auch bis auf den heutigen Tag > Niemand gerne verstehen mag. > Gehabe du dich mit Verstand, > Wie dir eben der Tag zur Hand; > Denk immer: ist's gegangen bis jetzt, > So wird es wohl auch gehen zuletzt. > > No one can really know himself, > detach himself from his inner being > Yet, each day he must put to the test, > What is in the end, clear. > What he is and what he was, > what he can be and what he might be. > > But, what goes on in the world, > No one really understands it rightly, > and also up to the present day, > no one desires to understand it. > Conduct yourself with discernment. > Just as the day offers itself; > Think always: it's gone well up to now, > so might it go until the end. > The two verses (which are not consecutive) are taken from the poem \\"Dedication\\" (Widmung), about the scholar and artist trying to understand himself and the world. According to Norman Del Mar, \\"These lines of searching introspection Strauss wrote out in full amongst the pages of sketches for Metamorphosen, the word metamorphosen being itself a term Goethe used in old age to apply to his own mental development over a great period of time in pursuit of ever more exalted thinking.\\" The quotation from the funeral march of Beethoven's Eroica Symphony with the words \\"In Memoriam!\\" has also raised speculation. The Eroica theme is motivically related to one of the main themes of Metamorphosen, but Strauss wrote that the connection did not occur to him until he was almost finished. There are several theories about how and why Strauss quoted Beethoven, and to whom or what \\"in memoriam\\" refers. In 1947 the critic Matthijs Vermeulen claimed the whole piece was an elegy for the Nazi regime, and that \\"in memoriam\\" referred to Hitler himself (although Hitler did not commit suicide until over two weeks after the piece was completed). This theory was quickly and strongly denied by Willi Schuh, who had been involved with the work from the beginning. Schuh stated that \\"in memoriam\\" referred not to Hitler but to Beethoven, and most scholars since then have supported this idea. Another theory involves Beethoven's Eroica having originally been dedicated to Napoleon, but after Beethoven's disillusion with Napoleon rededicated \\"to the memory of a great man\\", while Napoleon was still alive and in power; Strauss's quotation of the Eroica and writing \\"in memoriam\\" can be seen as having interesting parallels with Strauss's own involvement with and rejection of Hitler and the Nazi regime. Beethoven had ironically \\"buried\\" and memorialized the still-living Napoleon. Strauss could have been pointing to a famous precedent for his own rejection of a tyrant he had once been associated with. But while Beethoven had admired Napoleon, there is no evidence that Strauss ever admired Hitler. Also, Strauss was fond of oblique references and multiple layers of meaning and connotation. He may have meant the quotation and words \\"in memoriam\\" in more than one way. Main themes The main themes of Metamorphosen are given here at the pitch they first occur. The first four themes occur in the first 20 bars. The fifth theme occurs at bar 82, with the tempo marking \\"etwas flie√üender\\" (slightly flowing). \\\\relative c' {\\\\clef \\"bass\\" 2^\\"Theme 1, opening chords\\" 4\\\\. 8 1} \\\\relative c' {r^\\"Theme 2, Beethoven, Symphony No. 5\\" g'-.( g-. g-.)g2} \\\\relative c' {g'2^\\"Theme 3, Beethoven, Eroica Symphony\\" f16( ees8.) d16( c8.) c2} \\\\relative c' {fis2^\\"Theme 4\\"~ fis8 d4 cis8 ais4 b b'2 \\\\times2/3 { a4 g a }\\\\times2/3 { g4 fis g } fis e2} \\\\relative c' {\\\\clef \\"bass\\" b2^\\"Theme 5\\" a4. b8 a2 g4. a8 g4 fis~ fis8 [g a b] } Arrangements A version for string septet by Rudolf Leopold was published in 1996.

The parish covers an area of approximately . It is ten miles (16 km) east of the town of Huntingdon and is also ten miles (16 km) northwest from the city of Cambridge. Over contains the basic village facilities, including a primary school, shop, one public house (the Admiral Vernon) and St. Mary's Church. In recent years, the village has expanded rapidly, with the inclusion of several housing estates, a community and conference centre and modern sporting facilities. An Over day centre was set up in 1989 by Dr. Pamela Cressey. The Over Community Centre was set up with National Lottery funding of almost ¬£1 million in 1999. Over is mentioned in the poem \\"The Old Vicarage, Grantchester\\", by Rupert Brooke.  History  Signpost in Over Signpost in Over By 1628 the fens and meres to the north of the settlement were enclosed, as was the rest of the village land by 1837. Originally, there were two distinct settlements. One was at Church End around St Mary's Parish Church, the other at Over End - the south eastern part of the village around West street When it comes to buildings, Over is a village full of contrast both in terms of age and designs. Although the exact date is unknown, a row of old thatched cottages on the north side of the High Street were burned to the ground during a fire started by an arsonist. These were replaced by the large Victorian houses which feature balconies to the front. Much of the antiquated property in the village is Victorian, as the majority of the older clunch and wattle cottages have been demolished. The influence of the Dutch who, under the leadership of the engineer Vermuyden, came to drain the Fens, can be seen in several of Over's older houses - The Old Black Horse in the High Street and the Ivy House in Fen End are the most obvious, with their rounded end-walls and angled brick-ties. The town hall, in the High Street opposite Overcote Road, has the date MDCCCXLIX (1849) carved over the door. Apart from the parish church, the oldest remaining structure in Over now is believed to be the wall running down Fen End from the Willingham Road corner. The small patch of wall, now incorporated into newer brickwork, was believed by the late Ernie Papworth to have stood for over 500 years.  St Mary's Church  St Mary's Church, Over in July 2014 St Mary's Church is made almost entirely of stone from Barnack, in the extreme north of Cambridgeshire. It has traces of 14th century work, including flower-ball carvings, gargoyles representing birds and beasts, and a south porch of perfect proportions. Its size reflects the significant income the village received from, among other things, the Suffolk wool trade and goods sold in the market at St Ives. Unlike many Fenland and edge-of-fen churches, it is highly ornamented, which is evidence of the amount of money that was available at the time of construction and decoration: the more complicated the work, the more it cost. There are also two other churches in Over: a Methodist church in the Lanes, which was built in 1848 and features a typical one-storey design found in Methodist churches; and a Baptist church in New Road, built directly onto a house whose owner gave the land for the church to be built in 1737.  Over today  Today's Over is within a part of Cambridgeshire where there is enormous pressure for expansion with new housing and industrial and commercial buildings. The village has seen a number of estates built over the past 30 years. Plans have been approved for limited further growth, most of which is likely to be on small sites dotted around the village. One such development is a new estate, Hazel Green, which was completed by Camstead Homes in 2011. The village's population in 1951 was 910, rising to 2,420 by 1991.

It was the FM counterpart to WPAC.Broadcasting Yearbook 1958 page A-331 The two stations were owned by the Patchogue Broadcasting Company. Because WPAC was a daytimer, WPAC-FM simulcast its programming in the daytime and continued it after WPAC signed off the air at sunset. At first it was only powered at 7,800 watts on a 115-foot tower, only heard in and around Western Suffolk County. It would take several decades before the station expanded its coverage area. =Contemporary Hits= In January 1971 the station was purchased by Beck-Ross Communications, owner of WGLI (1290 AM) in Babylon, New York. The call sign was changed to WBLI. President Martin F. Beck switched the station to a contemporary format as \\"The New FM 106 WBLI\\". After Beck-Ross took ownership, the station initially broadcast from a trailer located behind the WPAC building in Medford, New York. In March 1971, WBLI moved to new studios at 31 West Main Street in Patchogue. WBLI's original air-staff included George Taylor Morris, Barry Neal (mornings), Jay Mitchell (program director & middays), Jimmy \\"Stoney Brook\\" Ryan, Brian Quinn (News), Mike \\"Scalzi\\" Josephs, with Tony \\"Dusty Hudson\\" Marzocco, and Pauly \\"Captain Jack Blight\\" Zarcone. Other DJs during the 1970s & 1980s included Alan \\"Al Nouveau\\" Bandiero, Mike \\"Davis Parke\\" Riccio, Randi Taylor, Bruce Michaels, Nick O'Neil, Chris Tyler, William \\"Billy Terry\\" Whitnum, Jeffrey Thomas (also the PD), Scott Taylor, Don Nelson, Rick Sommers, Keith Allen (later with WBZO and WELJ), Rob McLean, Mary Ann \\"J.J.

WBLI had a Saturday night dance show called Club 106 during the disco music era, hosted by Long Island club DJ Rory J. Thompson. On Sunday nights BLI aired an oldies show known as Only Gold during the 1970s through the mid-1980s, hosted by Bruce Michaels and later by Jerry St. James (Jim Cutler, currently owner of Jim Cutler Voiceovers) and then Donnie Nelson. Although technically a Top 40/CHR hitmusic radio station, WBLI had a more AC sound in certain day parts and avoided such harder rocking Top 40/CHR hits such as \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\\" by Joan Jett & The Blackhearts during their initial chart runs. =Shift to Hot AC= By 1991, with the CHR format on the decline across the country, WBLI evolved into more of a hot adult contemporary sound. Steve Harper and news director Ken Rhodes (Ken Rosato, now Channel 7 WABC-TV's morning news anchor) hosted the morning show. The station often ran special weekend programming such as the \\"Almost Made It But Didn't Weekend\\" and \\"The Ladies of the 80s Weekend.\\" Musically the station was slightly hotter than New York City's WPLJ and Mix 105 WMXV. In March 1994, Beck-Ross Communications was acquired by Liberty Broadcasting, the owners of two other Long Island stations, 1240 WGBB and 102.3 WBAB-FM. =Back to their Top 40/CHR roots= By February 1995, WBLI gradually began to move back to Top 40. Long time New England Top 40 DJ Alan \\"Al On The Scene\\" Levine joined WBLI as their new Music Director and nighttime jock. The station also began to run a music video countdown show on Friday nights called the \\"BLI's SEGWAY\\" hosted by Steve Harper and simulcast on Channel 55 WLNY-TV. WBLI also picked up the syndicated Saturday night show Open House Party - which had previously been run on the station in the late 80s. In July 1996 WBLI was acquired by Chancellor Broadcasting. Ken Rosato exited mornings and Kelly Nash (later at WNSH) exited afternoons, but WBLI started adding more CHUrban and dance product especially at night. In September 1996, Kenneth \\"Doctor Ken\\" Medek was hired to be Program Director after serving in that role in 98.5 WKRZ Wilkes- Barre, Pennsylvania. Under Ken and Al the station created special features like the \\"BLI's The Fresh Five at Nine\\", and the \\"BLI's New Music Challenge\\" returned. The station used the imaging voice of the late great Billy Moore and had a new jingle packages by TM Century. By 1997, WBLI was one of the more rhythmic mainstream CHRs in the Northeast, including \\"Classic Dance Weekends\\". Ken Medek left the station in September 1998 to return to WKRZ. =Cox Ownership= Atlanta-based Cox Media acquired the station in 1998.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1999 page D-308 When Cox Radio took over WBLI, it evolved into a more mainstream CHR with less dance product (though still more than most other CHR's) and a tighter playlist of hits. New imaging station voices was added to replace Billy, like Kurt Flood, Mark Driscoll, with Jennifer Vaughn, and the late great Brian James, but then on March the 29th, of 2006 incredible voice actor Beau Weaver took over as the new voice of 106.1 'BLI as well as an all brand spankin' new jingle package was debuted at the same time.

The first officer is second-in- command of the aircraft to the captain, who is the legal commander. In the event of incapacitation of the captain, the first officer will assume command of the aircraft. Control of the aircraft is normally shared equally between the first officer and the captain, with one pilot normally designated the \\"pilot flying\\" and the other the \\"pilot not flying\\", or \\"pilot monitoring\\", for each flight. Even when the first officer is the flying pilot, however, the captain remains ultimately responsible for the aircraft, its passengers, and the crew. In typical day-to-day operations, the essential job tasks remain fairly equal. Many airlines promote by seniority only within their own company. As a consequence, an airline first officer may be older and/or have more flight experience than a captain, by virtue of having experience from other airlines or the military. Traditionally, the first officer sits on the right-hand side of a fixed-wing aircraft (\\"right seat\\") and the left-hand side of a helicopter (the reason for this difference is related to the fact that in many cases the pilot flying is unable to release the right hand from the cyclic control to operate the instruments, thus he or she sits on the right side and does that with the left hand). Other airlines may designate the more senior of two first officers operating a long-haul sector together with a captain in an enlarged crew as the senior first officer. The senior first officer will then sit in the left seat when the captain takes a rest.

In its most common form with seats for two or four persons placed back to back, with the foot-boards projecting over the wheels and the typical conveyance for persons in Ireland at one time (outside jaunting car). Also with passenger seats facing each other (inside jaunting car) The first part of the word is generally taken to be identical with the verb to jaunt, now only used in the sense of to go on a short pleasure excursion, but in its earliest uses meaning to make a horse caracole or prance, hence to jolt or bump up and down. It would apparently be a variant of \\"jaunce\\", of the same meaning, which is supposed to be taken from old French '. Ireland It was a popular mode of transportation in 19th-century Dublin popularized by Valentine Vousden in a song by that name. Jaunting cars remain in use for tourists in some parts of the country, notably Killarney in County Kerry where tours of the lakes and national park are popular. The colloquial name for the Irish driver of a jaunting car was \\"jarvey\\", used in the song \\"The Jarvey Was a Leprechaun\\" by Val Doonican. Elsewhere When William Wordsworth toured Scotland in 1803 with his sister Dorothy and friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Coleridge procured an Irish jaunting car for the journey from a friend in Somerset. Managing the horse and car proved difficult for Wordsworth, who had appointed himself as the driver. Types Inside jaunting car, Norfolk, England There were two main varieties of jaunting car: the \\"outside jaunting car\\", or \\"outside car\\", the more common type described above, in which the passengers faced outward over the wheels, and the \\"inside jaunting car\\", or \\"inside car\\", considered to be more \\"genteel\\", in which the passengers sat with their backs to the sides of the car and faced each other. \\"Memoir of the Life of Henry Ware, Jr.\\" by John Ware, 1846, Vol II, p. 51. Anthony Trollope described the \\"inside jaunting-car\\" as \\"perhaps the most uncomfortable kind of vehicle yet invented.\\"\\"Can You Forgive Her?\\" by Anthony Trollope, Chapter XXXI. A third variety, the \\"covered car\\", was an inside car with oiled canvas arranged on all sides to protect the passengers from the weather, at the expense of visibility. \\"Hand-books for Ireland\\", by Samuel Carter Hall, 1853, pp. 83 ff. Taxation In the early 1800s, the British government levied a tax on every \\"jaunting car or pleasure car\\" (1813 Act of Parliament, 53 Geo III c.59).\\"Ireland - Jaunting Cars\\" by Clive Akerman in The Revenue Journal, Vol. XXII, No. 4, Whole No. 88, March 2012, p. 175.

The station is owned by Connoisseur Media, with studios and offices located at Airport Plaza in Farmingdale, New York and transmitter located on Telescope Hill in Farmingville, New York. WALK-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format with its HD2 channel carrying the mainstream rock programming of co-owned 94.3 WWSK.  History  =1952 to 1999= WALK-FM first signed on the air on December 12, 1952.Broadcasting Yearbook 1954 page 227 It was owned by the Suffolk Broadcasting Corporation, and was the FM counterpart to co-owned WALK 1370 AM. WALK was a daytimer station, so WALK-FM allowed listeners with FM radios to hear the programming after sunset. In its early years, WALK-AM-FM played classical music, big band, adult standards and jazz. WALK-FM was originally powered at 15,000 watts, only heard in the western part of Suffolk County. WALK-FM was purchased in 1963 by the Island Broadcasting System along with its sister stations, 1370 WALK Patchogue and 1570 WRIV Riverhead. Island Broadcasting was owned in part by NBC News anchorman Chet Huntley. In 1997, WALK-AM-FM were bought by Chancellor Communications. One of WALK-FM's longest running shows was \\"Klein 'til 9 and Again 'til 10\\" hosted by Bob Klein. Klein was the morning drive time disc jockey for much of the 1980s, 90s and early 2000s, helping a couple of generations of Long Islanders start their day. Klein died in 2017 at age 92. In 1985, WALK Pillow Talk began its long run of popularity. Hosted by Tom Rich, the Sunday evening program featured soft adult contemporary and rock favorites. WALK Pillow Talk quickly challenged the previously top-ranked Doctor Ruth Show on WYNY for the most listened-to show in its time period. Expanding WALK Pillow Talk to weeknights played a role in propelling WALK to #1 in the Nassau-Suffolk ratings for the first time ever, a position the station has held for most of the following 35 years. WALK-FM was one of the first stations on Long Island to run all Christmas music during the holiday season, beginning weeks before Christmas. The all-holiday format began in 1995 on AM 1370 WALK. Beginning in 2002 it was run on both WALK AM and FM. It continues to run on WALK-FM annually from several days before Thanksgiving through Christmas Day. = 2000s = In 2000, WALK-AM-FM were acquired by Clear Channel Communications.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2005 page D-366 In 2014, Clear Channel switched its name to iHeartMedia, Inc. The WALK Breakfast Club, the weekday morning show hosted by Mark Daniels and Cindy, was featured on ABC's \\"Good Morning America\\" in December 2005. A GMA reporter was live on national TV, asking Mark and Cindy about playing all holiday music on radio stations. After the report, Cindy accused Mark of paying off the photographer since the camera was only focusing on Mark. Long-time WALK-FM DJ Dave Shnayer, known as JD Howard on-air, died on November 17, 2007, after a three-year battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The death was announced the following afternoon by Holly Levis. = 2010s = WALK-FM dropped the slogan \\"Yesterday and Today,\\" switching to \\"Long Island's Best Variety\\" in May 2010. Around that time, the station began decreasing the amount of music from the 1970s to one- to-two songs per hour, starting the transition to a hotter AC format. Eventually, music from the 1970s was eliminated, and music from the 1980s has been scaled back. By July 2012, the station's tempo had increased to where it was no longer playing adult contemporary music but had switched to a hot adult contemporary format as Mediabase moved it to the \\"Hot AC Panel.\\" However, WALK-FM continued on the Nielsen BDS AC panel. On May 15, 2014, Qantum Communications announced that it would acquire WALK-AM-FM from the Aloha Station Trust in exchange for transferring its existing 29 stations to Clear Channel. Qantum immediately sold WALK-AM-FM to Connoisseur Media, making them sister stations to Nassau County-based AC station 98.3 WKJY. The transaction was consummated on September 9, 2014. The WALK stations were split up in late 2019, after Connoisseur donated the AM station to Cantico Nuevo Ministry, which renamed it WLID.  HD Programming  In mid-2006, WALK-FM began broadcasting in the HD Radio hybrid format. Weeks later, WALK-FM began playing country music on its HD2 subchannel, which Clear Channel Communications claimed was the first country station on Long Island in years. Programming on WALK-FM-HD2 was discontinued after the sale of the station to Connoisseur Media. WALK-FM-HD2 returned to the air in 2017 with sister station WWSK 94.3 FM \\"The Shark\\" now heard on the HD2 signal.HD Radio Guide The Shark is a mainstream rock station also serving Suffolk County.

It was first released in Newtype magazine from April 1987 to December 1991, and compiled in five novels released from September 1988 until April 1992. The novel was later adapted into a 26-episode radio drama that was broadcast on Japan's Nippon Cultural Broadcasting station from April 12 to October 4, 1992. The audio drama was released on five CDs from November 1992 until July 1993. Finally two soundtrack CDs were also released which included the music of the radio drama.  Plot summary  Gaia Gear is a story set in the future of the Universal Century timeline of the Mobile Suit Gundam anime universe, specifically in UC 0203. Once more, the governments of Earth and its space colonies are at odds and resolve their differences with mecha, now named \\"Man-Machines\\". This time the resistance group Metatron fights against the Man Hunting Attachment police force of the corrupt Earth Federation. To have better chances Metatron creates a memory clone of the legendary Char Aznable called Affranchi Char ('affranchi' being a French word for a 'freed slave'), who commands the troops of Metatron and pilots the Gaia Gear Alpha. = Introduction = Two hundred years have passed since people floated the islands called space colonies into outer space. During this time, several wars have occurred. It was a battle in order to protect the Earth. Amongst the twinkling of the stars, man hated one another, got hurt, and collapsed, yet did not forget love. Much blood was shed, and grief brought forth. The souls of the dead wander the silence of the universe become light and melt into the Milky Way. The immeasurable universe swallows the feelings of everyone, continuing with no change. When the Earth loses its radiance, changing the people‚Äôs prayer to sighs of grief, one soul crosses time. Perhaps that person was the harbinger who awoke for that. Volume summaries = Volume 1 = Affranchi Char is a 19-year-old man who was raised on an island in the Pacific Ocean. The \\"cell chips\\" inside his brain contain strange memories and information. Affranchi was raised by a man named Gaba Suu, one of the island's elders. On his deathbed, Gaba Suu tells Affranchi to go into space, but his lover Everly Key is strongly opposed. One day, a giant humanoid machine washes up on the island's shore, and Affranchi makes up his mind to leave. One stormy night, Affranchi sneaks away in a canoe, intending to catch a ship for Hong Kong and go from there into space. While he is waiting for the ship, he meets and quarrels with a bigoted stranger who tells Affranchi that the white man is humanity's elite, destined to rule over the lesser races. After Affranchi boards the ship, it is hijacked by pirates. Everly, who has followed Affranchi aboard, is taken hostage. Affranchi displays an uncanny prowess in the martial arts and defeats the hijackers. Upon their arrival in Hong Kong, Affranchi and Everly are met by a waiting limousine. They are taken to meet the mysterious Berm Segen and his secretary Miranda Howe, who give Affranchi the antique \\"Man Machine\\" (Mobile Suit), the Zorin Soul. Suddenly, strangers burst in and kill Berm Segen, and our heroes flee in the Zorin Soul. Affranchi operates the machine with unnatural skill, returning Everly to her home island and then heading to Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, Affranchi battles the forces of Maha, the Federation government's dreaded \\"Man-Hunting Agency.\\" Formally known as the 13th Special Investigative Section of the Earth Federation Government Police Agency, this group is responsible for discovering illegal Earth residents and deporting them to the space colonies. Affranchi is able to fight off the Maha forces and, with the help of Miranda Howe, he hijacks a space shuttle and loads the Zorin Soul on board. Miranda tells the shuttle pilot to set course for the Side 4 shoal zone. Here they rendezvous with the waiting transport ship Spacious, whose crew greet Affranchi as \\"Your Excellency Char Aznable.\\" Among the crew is a beautiful young woman named Krishna Pandent. The Spacious heads for the Side 2 colony Hellas, hiding Affranchi and Miranda in order to smuggle them into the colony. The ship makes its way through the colony to the factory block at the other end, along the way rescuing a young hang-glider named Ul Urian. The Spacious reaches the factory block and drops Ul Urian off, but the timing of his chance encounter with the Spacious strikes the crew as very suspicious. = Volume 2 = Affranchi, Miranda, and Krishna board an electric car and drive through the colony. They enter the Grenze district, which is a colossal slum, and a sudden attack by Maha's Minox craft forces them to flee into the tunnels in search of shelter. Affranchi is separated from his comrades and captured by the police. After clashing with his cellmates, Affranchi befriends one of them, a giant named Todd Goering. Affranchi is then released, but the Maha agent Ul Urian has planted a transmitter in his stomach in order to track him. Ul Urian submits a report to his commander Bijan Dargol, and then goes to meet Krishna for a \\"date\\" with the intention of taking her prisoner. Affranchi wanders the streets and encounters a gang of delinquents led by a man named Messer Mett, who turns out to be another friend of Todd Goering. Affranchi then runs into Miranda Howe and another Spacious crewmember named Joe Suren, who feed him a big dose of laxatives so he can get rid of the transmitter. Meanwhile, Ul Urian meets Krishna at a French restaurant and begins quizzing her about the \\"Z Organization\\" for which she works and the whereabouts of its secret base \\"314.\\" Krishna attempts to escape but is abducted by Ul Urian. Affranchi and friends begin pursuit, and Ul Urian summons his Minox, bringing Krishna aboard with him. The Z Organization dispatches the Gaia Gear, operated by a pilot named Keran Mead, to engage the Minox. But since Krishna is aboard the Minox, the Gaia Gear is helpless to fight it. Fortunately, the Gaia Gear is protected by its barrier, and the Minox ends up losing control and crashing thanks to the shockwaves caused by its own attacks. Two Gussa man machines appear, and Keran's Gaia Gear knocks one to the ground, allowing Affranchi to board it and defeat the second enemy machine. Affranchi, Keran, and their comrades escape the colony and board the Z Organization's warship \\"Thirty-One Square.\\" Overruling the ship's captain, Affranchi orders the crew to rescue the captive Krishna. While he's at it, he renames the Z Organization \\"Metatron\\" and rechristens the Thirty-One Square as \\"Mother Metatron.\\" The Mother Metatron heads for Hellas, demanding that the colony government turn over its political prisoners. The Maha commander Bijan Dargol, meanwhile, readies his own military response. = Volume 3 = The Mother Metatron approaches Hellas, with Affranchi leading the charge in his Gaia Gear. Affranchi, impatient with the stalling of the colony government, orders the Mother Metatron to fire on the colony's agricultural blocks. Using this as a pretext, Bijan Dargol launches a preemptive attack on the Metatron forces. Ul Urian launches from the Maha flagship Maha Gayjisu to lead the attack, piloting the new man machine Bromb Texter and carrying Krishna as a hostage. But just before he enters battle, Ul Urian sets Krishna adrift in space, with the intention of picking her up later. Affranchi easily defeats Ul Urian and then, sensing Krishna's whereabouts, goes to rescue her. Having recovered Krishna and collected the colony's other political prisoners, the Mother Metatron heads for the secret base \\"Thirty-One Cubed.\\" Among the released prisoners are the delinquent Messer Mett and his lackeys Rey Seias, Reyzam Stack, and Saez Konsoon, who decide to remain with Metatron and become combat pilots. However, they get along poorly with the rest of the crew and begin considering desertion. Metatron learns that the Maha fleet is preparing to descend to Earth, an act of \\"reverse immigration\\" by which Maha will establish its own nation on Earth. The Mother Metatron likewise sets course for Earth in order to intercept the enemy fleet. The Metatron forces deploy the shuttles Air Force 1 and Air Force 2, escorted by Affranchi's Gaia Gear. Ul Urian's Bromb Texter attempts to intercept the Gaia Gear, but Messer Mett and his comrades unexpectedly join the battle and attack the Bromb Texter. Reyzam's man machine Dochadi is shot down in the ensuing combat. The fighting continues as both sides enter the atmosphere. Affranchi rams into Ul Urian's Bromb Texter, forcing the enemy pilot to retreat. The Maha Gayjisu deploys its Gussa forces, the Metatron shuttles launch their own man machines, and the Metatron forces are ultimately forced to withdraw. Messer and his two surviving henchmen desert during the battle. Air Force 1 and Air Force 2 land in Hamar, Norway, where the Metatron members join forces with the local resistance. Messer and his comrades go to ground in Ireland, where they learn from a news broadcast that the main Maha fleet has arrived in Nouveau Paris. They decide to surrender to Maha, offering their man machines as gifts. As they approach Nouveau Paris, Messer and his friends encounter a Federation Forces truck convoy. They begin negotiating their surrender, only to discover that their old comrade Todd Goering is among the prisoners being transported in the convoy. Instead of surrendering, they decide to rescue Todd and escape, but a Gussa team from Nouveau Paris is now in hot pursuit. Picking up Messer's distress signal, Air Force 1 and Affranchi's Gaia Gear launch to meet them, and an aerial battle begins over Denmark. = Volume 4 = Affranchi leads the Metatron forces to victory, repulsing Ul Urian's man machine team and successfully recovering Messer and friends. However, during the battle Krishna falls out of Air Force 1, and the Metatron forces have no time to search for her before they withdraw. Back at Hamar, Todd tells Affranchi and the others what he learned about Maha's plans while toiling as a forced laborer. It appears that Maha intends to establish a \\"Gaia Empire\\" on Earth, governed by a chosen elite. For sentimental reasons, the Maha commander Bijan Dargol has chosen Bavaria as the heart of his new empire. Krishna, meanwhile, has once again been picked up by Ul Urian, who has now been demoted to command of the support vehicle Bushing Nugg. Having used hypnotic interrogation to find out everything she knows about Metatron, Ul Urian is now keeping her around for his own amusement. Accepting her situation, Krishna decides to throw in her lot with Maha. The two sides soon clash again at Liege, Belgium. After a gun battle in the city, the Metatron and Maha pilots run for their machines. Rey Seias, Saez Konsoon, and Keran Mead enter battle in Dochadis, but Saez and Keran are shot down by Ul Urian's Bromb Texter, and Rey's damaged machine crashes in the forest. Air Force 1 attacks the Bushing Nugg, but is shot down by Krishna's anti-air fire, and the crew are forced to escape. Air Force 2 and Affranchi's Gaia Gear finally arrive, driving the Maha forces away. Rey and the Air Force 1 crew are rescued, but the Metatron forces have taken heavy losses and they are shocked by Krishna's betrayal. The Mother Metatron begins bombarding Nouveau Paris with missiles, and Miranda Howe arrives with reinforcements in the form of Air Force 3. The Mother Metatron's bombardment inflicts considerable damage on the Maha forces, and the Maha Gayjisu withdraws from the city. The Metatron forces gather in Besan√ßon, France, to establish a frontline base. Even as Affranchi and his comrades battle Maha's ground forces in Besan√ßon, they learn that a Maha fleet from Hong Kong is now approaching the Adriatic Sea. The Metatron forces engage the Hong Kong Maha fleet, but are overwhelmed by the performance of the new enemy machine Gids Geese. = Volume 5 = Affranchi returns to Besan√ßon to find that Todd Goering has devised a new plan for their man machine forces. The Gaia Gear will now be entrusted to Messer, while Affranchi stands by at Besan√ßon. Messer sorties in the Gaia Gear to intercept an approaching Bromb Texter, and returns with Ul Urian as his prisoner. From the Bromb Texter's flight data, they determine that the Maha forces are gathering at Munich, and Metatron begins preparations for an attack. As the attack preparations are underway, the Metatron member Joe Suren takes off in the Zorin Soul in order to look for Krishna. He is detected by Maha, and the attack on Munich is aborted. The Hong Kong Maha launch another attack, but this time they are outnumbered by Affranchi's Gaia Gear, Messer's captured Bromb Texter, and a third wave of reinforcements dropped from the Mother Metatron. Meanwhile, Krishna is wandering in the woods near the battlefield, and is rescued by a mysterious young woman. Joe Suren finally locates Krishna, and in the process he retrieves a floppy disk from a crashed man machine. According to this floppy disk, Benoit Rojak, the leader of the new Metatron reinforcements, has been given secret orders to assassinate Affranchi after Maha has been eliminated. As for the mysterious young woman who rescued Krishna, she turns out to be Affranchi's former lover, Everly Key. Affranchi and his comrades relocate to Monfalcone, Italy, to prepare for the final confrontation with Maha. Benoit Rojak and her Gaiyas team are already on the scene. Affranchi proposes that they make it look as if Metatron is attacking Munich and Neuschwanstein Castle, splitting the Maha forces so they can ambush Bijan Dargol himself. Joe, Krishna, and Everly rush to Monfalcone to warn Affranchi of Benoit's treachery, but they are detected en route by Ul Urian, who has returned to Maha and received a new Gids Geese man machine. Joe drops off Krishna and Everly, then attempts to draw Ul Urian's attention away from them, but his Zorin Soul is swiftly shot down. Ul Urian finds the women and takes Everly captive, leaving Krishna behind. Just before the Metatron forces begin their attack, Todd discovers Krishna in the nearby woods, and she tells Affranchi of Benoit's treachery and Everly's predicament. Affranchi continues the operation regardless, and joins battle with the enemy flagship Maha Gayjisu. Ul Urian enters the battle in his Gids Geese, carrying Everly as a hostage, and uses his knowledge of the Bromb Texter's characteristics and weaknesses to shoot down Messer's captured machine. The battle continues. Bijan Dargol attempts to defend Neuschwanstein Castle from Affranchi's forces. Benoit Rojak ambushes and destroys the Maha Gayjisu, and the ensuing explosion consumes many nearby man machines, including Benoit's own. Metatron begins mopping up the remaining Maha forces, and Rey Seias is hit by Ul Urian, forcing her to make an emergency landing at the castle. Affranchi confronts Ul Urian and, sensing that Everly isn't aboard the enemy machine, shoots him down. Rey and Affranchi enter the castle, where they find Everly. Affranchi and Everly embrace as Rey succumbs to her injuries, then board the Gaia Gear and fly away to an island in the Atlantic Ocean to live happily ever after.

Chartered in 1815, the navigation opened in 1825 to provide transportation and water power. At the time, the river was the least expensive and most efficient method of transporting bulk cargo, and the eastern seaboard cities of the U.S. were experiencing an energy crisis due to deforestation. It fostered the mining of anthracite coal as the major source of industry between Pottsville and eastern markets. Along the tow-paths, mules pulled barges of coal from Port Carbon through the water gaps to Pottsville; locally to the port and markets of Philadelphia; and some then by ship or through additional New Jersey waterways, to New York City markets. The Schuylkill was in operation until 1931 History of the Schuylkill Navigation System , Reading Area Community College. and was almost completely filled in the 1950s. Some remaining watered reaches are now used for recreation. Taken from a kayak between Port Providence and Lock 60,  History  canals of Pennsylvania shown after the additional extensions adopted in 1837 were all completed. Passage of the original Main Line of Public Works legislative package was in 1826 (In part, due to the success of the Schuylkill which hit its stride by then). The incorporation of the Schuylkill Navigation Company, the application for a charter to improve the Lehigh, and the Erie Canals, all in 1815, raised the national consciousness about the differences between the United States and Europe's and especially Great Britain's water transportation networks. But it took the lower Lehigh Canal project's test shipments of coal in 1819 proving the Lehigh's locks concept, the temporary market-glut caused by their 1820 achievements of delivering over 365 tons of Anthracite to Philadelphia, and then the regularly increasing tonnages shipped down to Philadelphia's docks over the next 2‚Äì3 years, to excite and inspire the movers and shakers of Pennsylvania and attract far-sighted investors and speculators from all along the Eastern Seaboard cities to capitalize and fund companies. which began a deluge of private canal projects in the 1820s (or act to finish those well begun, but long lacking funding and resources, like the Schuylkill Canal and the Chesapeake & Delaware Ship Canal)‚Äîvastly accelerating the nascent North American Canal Age; the Delaware and Hudson Canal companies, the Delaware and Raritan Canal, the Morris Canal, the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal and various others were conceived, incorporated, funded or finally constructed as a result of the successes in 1821 & 1822 of the Erie and Lehigh projects. The Schuylkill Navigation Company was chartered in 1815 to build a series of navigation improvements in the Schuylkill River, nearly as early as the much more ambitious Erie Canal and well ahead of other key canals fueling the Industrial Revolution, such as the Delaware and Hudson, the Lehigh, the Chesapeake and Ohio, Delaware and Raritan and Morris canals. As related in The Delaware and Lehigh Canals history, two of the principle investors were partner industrialists & mill owners White and Hazard, who were anxious to secure a reliable source of fuel for their mills. Early on in the board meetings of the new corporation, they'd quarreled with others over the funding, timings, and tasks necessary and when they could not prevail to speed the project, immediately explored the option of making a navigation on the Lehigh River and acquiring the mining rights of the failing Lehigh Coal Mine Company and other investors to fund the projects. The Lehigh and Schuylkill canals had similar problems, both had to make navigable a series of rapids with rivers providing less water than was optimal‚Äîand ironically, by the 1820s, both eventually shipped coal from the opposite ends of the Little Schuylkill River's tributary, and the coal deposits once owned by Lehigh Coal Mine Company (the LCMC), in the Panther Creek Valley. When the engineering challenges and finances allowed, the Schuylkill Canal began operations in 1825. The initial configuration completed in 1827, was waterway of was linking Philadelphia to Port Carbon in the Southern Anthracite Coal Fields near Pottsville. Combining of separate canals, often referred to as \\"reaches\\", with of slack water pools (so called \\"levels\\"), the Schuylkill Navigation used 92 lift locks to overcome the difference of in elevation between its terminal points. This was similar in degree to the gradients of the Lehigh Canal but twice the height drop in twice the distance, both much steeper than the Erie Canals leisurely descents. In point of fact, canals in the United States rarely kept their original configurations and improvements continued over their life; if for no other reason, periodically ice damage and freshets occur pointing out shortcomings, leading to improvements. By the early 1820s, the coal coming down the Lehigh and Schuylkill canals having alleviated the high costs of heating, overcoming in just a few years the long suffered shortages of fuels in Eastern cities and towns The Auburn Tunnel, a 450-foot (137 m) bore through a hill near Auburn, was completed in 1821, but by 1857, due to increased traffic, canal capacity (widening) modifications turned it into an open-cut. Like the later Delaware Canal was to the Lehigh, the Union Canal, built between 1821 and 1828, was purpose designed to connect the Susquehanna River with the Schuylkill Canal at Reading. When completed, the two canals combined to make a water link between Philadelphia and the slack water level of the Susquehanna River at Middletown. This route along the Schuylkill Valley was envisioned primarily as a coal road, whilst the Union Canal was engineered for cross-state passenger and cargoes; but it also competed with and then became secondary to the east‚Äìwest divisions of the Pennsylvania Canal System on the Main Line of Public Works between Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Pittsburgh. The Schuylkill Canal also featured the first transportation tunnel in America. Schuylkill Canal (starting at Philadelphia) with other US canals of 1825 By transporting bulk cargoes and provide water power, the Schuylkill Navigation transformed the towns of Reading, Norristown, and Pottsville into early manufacturing centers. By using the Delaware River and the Delaware and Raritan and Morris Canals, manufactured products and anthracite from the Schuylkill Valley could also reach New York Harbor. The Schuylkill Navigation system quickly assumed a monopoly position in the transportation of anthracite coal from the coal mines of Schuylkill County to Philadelphia, and by 1841, was annually transporting over 737,517 tons of cargo. = Competition with the railroad = In 1841, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad opened, and within four years, was hauling three times as much anthracite to Philadelphia each year as the Schuylkill Navigation. In response, the Schuylkill Navigation Company enlarged its canals; by 1847, they could accommodate the passage of boats carrying 230 tons of coal. These barges were better than twice the size that could be used on the rival Lehigh and Delaware Canals with the latter's limited lock lengths; an artifact of having a state run a practical construction project without businessmens balancing viewpoints. In 1850, a price-fixing arrangement with the railroad stabilized prices for the transportation of anthracite. This decade was the Schuylkill Navigation's most prosperous period; in 1859, its peak year, it transported 1,700,000 tons of cargo. However, in that same year the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad carried over 2,500,000 tons, an amount comparable to the Lehigh Canal's 1855 peak of 2,300,000 tons of coal. unissued share of the Schuylkill Navigation Company During the 1860s the railroads had become the king of transportation with their improved power and speed of travel, so like most North American canals, the Schuylkill Canal began to decline in use for general freight and the wealthier westward bound passengers had long since used the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad to reach the Pennsylvania Canal System to cross the Alleghenies. In 1857, the Pennsylvania Railroad had connected Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, would eventually add New York City and Chicago, and was instrumental in the declining fortunes of Pennsylvania's far flung network of canals. Railroads could reach mine heads and coal breakers where no stream existed to support the costly digging of a new ditch. Coal shifted away from canals to the more flexible means of bulk goods transportation. Where the established canals supplied, their markets mostly remained relatively stable and they generally remained competitive with only a gradual erosion of market share as decades passed. Eventually, Oil heat and their perennial problems of delivering in winter's cold diminished their role. The self-examination during the early years of the Great Depression would end up closing most, as it did the Schuylkill Navigation Company. = Decline = In 1869 the Schuylkill Navigation was damaged by a flood, hindering operations for some time whilst repairs could be made. In 1870, its board of directors forced by stockholders, the Schuylkill Navigation Company leased its waterway to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad for 110 years, surrendering to the competition. Under the railroad's control, the Schuylkill Navigation continued to decline as a general freight carrier, but operated primarily as a coal road, like the Lehigh and Delaware Canals into the 1930s, since for heating and especially, steam power, nearly everyone needed anthracite. The traffic on the canal was expedited by corporate maneuvers when its New York City and New Jersey markets connecting Delaware and Raritan Canal was acquired in 1872Delaware and Raritan Canal, \\"On May 18, 1872, the D&R; Canal Company was merged with several parallel railroads into the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company, and leased by the Pennsylvania Railroad.\\" by the competing Pennsylvania Railroad‚Äîin a blatant act supporting a bid for monopoly, soon Schuylkill boats were denied access to this important New Jersey waterway. As a result, traffic on the Schuylkill decreased rapidly. Adding insult to injury, the PRR itself invaded the Schuylkill's territory with the construction of its Schuylkill Branch in the mid-1880s. By 1890 only 144,994 tons of cargo passed through the Schuylkill Navigation. The Schuylkill Navigation was also hindered by coal silt deposits that made its upper sections almost unusable. By 1891 the portion of Navigation above Port Clinton was abandoned. By 1904 the anthracite traffic had almost completely ceased, and after 1913 only an occasional cargo passed between Port Clinton and Philadelphia. Excursion vessels and pleasure boating remained active on the Schuylkill Navigation until most of the canals were filled by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during 1947‚Äì1979 in efforts to remove coal silt from the Schuylkill River.  Chester County Canal  The Chester County Canal, also known as the Phoenixville Branch Canal, was an addition to the Navigation built by the Schuylkill Navigation Company in 1828 to provide water power to a new nail works in Phoenixville. The new canal connected the slackwater pool of the Schuylkill Canal above the Black Rock Dam to Phoenixville. This canal paralleled the top end of the Oakes Reach, on the opposite side or the river. While the Chester County Canal was initially built to provide water power to the mill, in 1847 it carried scheduled passenger service between Phoenixville and Norristown. The spring freshet of 1869 destroyed the mill \\"and very much injured the canal and its locks.\\"Pennypacker, p. 168  The Navigation in the present day  While many of the dams remain, there are only a few watered stretches of the canal still in existence. Some of the original long Oakes Reach between Oaks and Mont Clare and the reach in Manayunk. Ruins and remnants of the canals structure are still visible along its length. Many of the locks chambers still exist but are buried to varying degrees. Some of the locktender's houses still exist. Even if filled in, the canal's presence in many river communities is remembered by several Canal Streets. Leesport has a restored Locktender's house on E. Wall Street. The adjacent lock had long been filled with a car wash located on the site, but in 2011, the lock car wash was removed, and the lock unearthed. Near Gibraltar, the Allegheny Creek Aqueduct still exists along with a drained section of the canal prism. The Aqueduct is on the National Register of Historic Places. = Oakes Reach = The head of the Oakes Reach is at the Black Rock Dam (Dam #26), near Mont Clare. The canal passes through the dam structure at Lock #60. The volunteer Schuylkill Canal Association has restored Lock 60 to operating condition.http://www.schuylkillcanal.com/restoration/index.html Lock 60 miter gates and tow path bridge after their 2004-5 restoration. Canal aqueduct over Crossman's Run, near Oaks The nearby locktender's house has also been restored.http://www.schuylkillcanal.com/about/lockhouse.html The Reach runs under Pennsylvania Route 29 in Mont Clare, directly across the river from Phoenixville, then through Port Providence. An impounding basin from the silt removal project cuts the canal after Longford Road and the final mile of the Reach, has been filled in. An old stone aqueduct, that carried the Canal over Crossman's Run, and the outlet lock tender's house are still existent; but Lock 61, Brower's Lock, was filled in. This reach is named for Thomas Oakes, chief engineer of the Schuylkill Navigation Company. The Oakes Reach canal, locks, locktenders' houses, Black Rock Dam, and the slackwater pool extending up to the Pennsylvania Route 113 bridge form the \\"Schuylkill Navigation Canal, Oakes Reach Section\\" historic district. On December 30, 2017 what is thought to be the non mechanized, human powered speed record was set on the Oaks Reach by Todd Martin, originally of Mont Clare. The record of 19 minutes 38 seconds, was set on ice skates from the existing waste water control valve structure at the lower end to the Lock 60 Lower Lock Head Wall. The distance traveled for the record is 2.33 miles. 3\\" of snow was present on the ice, temp 14 F, head wind approximately 10‚Äì15 mph. * Lock 60 * Present end of reach * Lock 61 Tender's House = Manayunk Reach = The head of the Manayunk Reach is at the Flat Rock Dam (Dam 31), near Shawmont. The canal originally passed through the dam structure at Lock 68. However Lock 68 is plated off, and the forereach area above has silted in. Remains of Lock 70 at the outlet of the Manayunk Reach Manayunk Reach, a very industrial section of the Navigation This stretch of canal forms the northern side of Venice Island, which is facing development pressures. At the downstream end of this reach, the canal runs through Manayunk and returns to the river via Locks 69 & 70\\\\. All three lock structures still exist. * Lock 68 * Locks 69&70 = Schuylkill River Trail = The Schuylkill River Trail (SRT) now overlays portions of the canal route. In Manayunk, the Trail was constructed across the canal from the towpath. (The Reading railroad built a freight spur on the canal towpath.) In 2008 the extension of the Schuylkill River Trail from the Perkiomen Creek to Longford Road in Oaks opened. This length of the Trail makes use of the general course of the filled portion of the Oakes Reach and originally used the old canal aqueduct to cross Crossman's Run. On 14 February 2008, a meeting was held to announce the survey work for the extension of the Schuylkill River Trail along the towpath of the watered portion of the Oakes Reach. It was expected that the towpath restoration itself would commence around March 2009. However this work was suspended due to budget constraints. The work was restarted in 2014, and the restored towpath should reopen in 2015.

Initially, two lines of miniatures were produced: Distinguished Flying Collectibles (a line of World War II aircraft) and Renaissance Dreams (a line of fantasy jewelry). Reaper moved to Lewisville, Texas, in April 1993, and at this location they reactivated several old miniature lines that the company owned and combined them into the Dungeon Dweller 25 mm fantasy line. Reaper saw further growth and need for expansion in August 1994, and moved into a warehouse in Lewisville. Late in 1995, they launched the Scrye Counter series of collectible card game accessories and over 500,000 have been sold worldwide. The Dark Heaven 25 mm fantasy line was launched in 1996, and is the top-selling fantasy role-playing game (RPG) miniature line in the world. Reaper has also expanded into the European market through a partnership with a miniatures company in England. In July 1998, Reaper launched the Warlord 25 mm fantasy line, CAV N-scale sci-fi line (Combat Assault Vehicle), Reaper Box Sets, Reaper Pro Paints, and Reaper Masters Series Paints. January 2004 saw Reaper move once again, to a new production facility in Denton, Texas. The company has had five Bones Kickstarter campaigns. These have been used to launch and expand their lines of plastic miniatures in a new material. The first ended on August 26, 2012, with participants pledging over US$3 million, making it the third highest overall Kickstarter at the time.Article on Crowdfundinsider.com visited on December 28, 2013. The second campaign also reached above $3 million and as of the end of 2013 both were among the ten highest Kickstarters ever.Kickstarter visited on December 28, 2013. The third campaign was the shortest, running from July 7 to July 25, 2015. It raised $2.7 million dollars. The fifth began October 1st, 2019 and will end October 31st. Reaper also manufactures two acrylic water-based paint lines designed for painting the miniatures which they manufacture.  Community & web presence Reaper has an online community, from their online forum.http://www.reapermini.com/forum/ Reaper also maintains an on site research and development facility for their games called \\"The Asylum\\". The Asylum is open to the public and also serves as a sort of company store, offering not only Reaper products, but a wide area of family board games and various role-playing games. Miniature Lines = Current Miniature Lines = As of 2013, Reaper has five major lines of miniatures and two minor lines: *Dark Heaven Legends: Primarily aimed at fantasy role players. It contains many models designed for running role playing campaigns; from models to represent characters and monsters to familiars, weapons and accessories. This line provides the bulk of miniatures, which has now passed 3000 serial numbers. *Warlord (miniature game): Reaper's highly successful skirmish game. Set in the fictional world of Taltos, ten factions fight in the provinces for control. Players battle across the world, and then log into the Reaper website to report wins and losses, thus allowing a dynamic, evolving world.http://warlordhq.reapergames.com/ warlordhq.reapergames.com *Bones: Bones takes many of the best miniatures from the Dark Heaven Legends and Chronoscope lines and casts them in plastic along with many new designs, including some too large to produce in metal. \\"Ready to Paint\\" right out of the package, they are priced significantly less than more traditional metal miniatures. The Bones line has been funded by several successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns. http://www.reapermini.com/Miniatures/Bones *Combat Assault Vehicle (CAV): A game similar to BattleTech. Much like Warlord, players battle across the world and post results online as 10 fighting companies battle for dominance over 6 planets. CAV 2 is currently being developed.http://www.reapergames.com reapergames.com *Chronoscope: A new line of non-fantasy pewter miniatures in the tradition of Dark Heaven Legends was released in 2008. The initial launch consisted of 8 miniatures including some science fiction pieces and a cowgirl. The line has since expanded to include additional genres, such as superheroes and espionage. The set also includes a handful of models based on historic figures such as Buffalo Bill Cody and classic literary characters such as Sherlock Holmes and Zorro. *Reich of the Dead: A line of miniatures dedicated to a game of the same name that is currently in development. The game and miniature line both focus on an alternate World War II in which an Alien species called the Kroid possess and reanimate German casualties and battle American GIs. *Master Series Miniatures: A line dedicated to larger scale or show-piece miniatures. Of the initial ten models in the series, eight have been issued in 54 mm scale. = Previous Miniature Lines = *Legendary Encounters was their line of non- random pre-painted plastics. The lineup was drawn from existing sculpts in the Dark Heaven line, with some sculpts from the Warlord line. It was introduced in 2007.http://www.reapermini.com/ *P-65 Heavy Metal: A line featuring re- issued miniatures from previous Reaper product lines, particularly Dark Heaven Legends, cast in a 60% lead alloy. Production of this line ceased in February 2013.http://www.reapermini.com/ *Legend of the Five Rings (L5R): Another miniature line directed at a specific role playing setting: the Rokugan setting. This has an Asian flair, with samurai and ninjas for characters and enemies. Reaper's license for L5R expired on October 31, 2005. *Exalted: This line of miniatures was made specifically for White Wolf's Exalted RPG. Reaper's license to produce this line expired at the end of 2005, and it is no longer in production. Paint Lines Two paint lines are produced: Pro paints, and the Masters Series. Reception Scott Haring reviewed Reaper Miniatures for Pyramid #7 (May 1994) and stated that \\"In many ways, Reaper Miniatures is a throwback to the good old days of miniatures. No fancy four- color backing cards, foam packing and blister packs; Reaper's minis come in a small plastic bag with a red title card stapled over the top.

In 1894, Torresdale was the site of the regatta of the Rowing Association of American Colleges.List of winners of the regatta of the Rowing Association of American Colleges Long before there was what is referred to today as the Philadelphia Main Line, Torresdale, along with Holmesburg to its south and Andalusia to its north, had been Philadelphia's posh suburban neighborhood, as evidenced by Glen Foerd on the Delaware, a luxurious riverside estate and Andalusia, the Biddle estate, for which the village of Andalusia is named. Notable sites Torresdale is the site of Holy Family University and Nazareth Academy High School. The Union League Golf Club at Torresdale, a Donald Ross‚Äìdesigned golf course, located at Frankford and Grant Avenues, is one of the finest golf courses in the Philadelphia region. In 2015, the Union League of Philadelphia undertook a complete restoration of the course and historic clubhouse, which drew significant national attention. The Frankford Avenue Bridge over Poquessing Creek is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. All Saints' Episcopal Church was established in 1772. Eden Hall Chapel, built in 1849 as part of the former Convent of the Sacred Heart, was demolished in 2007. The municipal Baxter Water Treatment Plant opened in 1909 as the Torresdale Water Treatment Plant. Glen Foerd on the Delaware is a historic estate established in 1850, listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Historic American Landscapes.

It is a weekly, free, tabloid-sized paper established in 1972. Its sections cover local and international news, comment, politics, science, advice, the Welsh-language section \\"Taf-od\\", campus life and sport. In 2003, Gair Rhydd launched Quench, a fortnightly student lifestyle magazine. In 2013, Quench transitioned to a monthly format, and is now editorially independent of Gair Rhydd. History The first paid editor, Meirion Jones (now on the BBC's Newsnight), was elected in 1980. Since then, Gair Rhydd has won several student media awards, some in the early 1990s and, in the 2000s the title of Best Paper at the NUS/Daily Mirror National Student Journalism Awards 2004, Best Newspaper at the Guardian Student Media Awards 2005, with deputy editor James Anthony also being named overall Student Journalist of the Year, and Quench winning Best Magazine, adding to its award for Student Publication of the Year 2005 at the EMAP Fanzine Awards. At the 2008 Guardian Student Media Awards, Quench was named Magazine of the Year. Gair Rhydd was named runner-up in the Newspaper of the Year category at the following year's awards. Most recently, as part of Cardiff Student Media, it won 'Best Student Media' at the NUS Wales awards in 2013. The position of Gair Rhydd editor formed part of the role of VP Media & Marketing, one of the seven elected officer positions at Cardiff University Students' Union. The role was removed during the 2014‚Äì15 academic year, reverting the role of editor back to a non-sabbatical position, meaning the paper had a student editor for the first time since before Meirion Jones. Past editor Tom Wellingham and two other student journalists were suspended when, on 4 February 2006, they reproduced a controversial cartoon depicting Mohammed. The issue was withdrawn from publication (98% of copies retrieved) within a day of being released, and the Cardiff University Students' Union issued an apology. Cartoons were reinstated as a regular feature in issue #1081 in 2016. In 2006, Gair Rhydd celebrated the publication of its 800th issue. Later that year, on 12 June 2006, a one-off Berliner format edition (issue number 818) was published, making Gair Rhydd the first non-national British newspaper to use this format, and the only one not owned by Guardian Newspapers. In March 2013, Gair Rhydd celebrated its 1000th issue with a special 'three-paper' edition. As well as the regular paper, they produced a commemorative pull-out looking back through the previous 41 years, and reproduced the first ever Gair Rhydd.

History The farm was established in 1793 when Virginian John Breckinridge, a future U.S. senator and attorney general, purchased 2,467 acres (10 km2) of land and on a portion of it established a Thoroughbred horse-breeding operation. On his death, the property transferred to his daughter, Mary Ann, the then Mrs. David Castleman, who eventually built a mansion on the horse-farm site and gave it the family name. Under the Castlemans, Castleton Farm continued as a Thoroughbred operation, but added the breeding of American Saddlebreds and Standardbreds for harness racing. Development by James R. Keene The original property changed hands several times, occasionally small parts being divvied up and sold to multiple different parties. In the early 1890s, Wall Street tycoon James R. Keene acquired the farm and purchased additional land to bring the operation to almost 1,000 acres (4 km2). Keene usually referred to the farm as \\"Castleton Stud\\", and under his direction, it became one of the greatest Thoroughbred operations of its day. The farm bred and/or raced future U.S. racing Hall of Fame horses Kingston, Domino, Ben Brush, Colin, Sysonby, Maskette, and Peter Pan. As part of a program honoring important horse racing tracks and racing stables, the Pennsylvania Railroad named its baggage car #5865 the \\"Castleton Farm\\". Upon the death of James R. Keene in 1913, the farm was taken over by his son Foxhall P. Keene. He continued the operation on a slightly reduced basis, but sold it in the 1920s to fellow New Yorker, David Look. Look had considerable success in harness racing, but was forced to sell the farm after experiencing personal financial setbacks during the Great Depression. Mid- to late 20th century In the early 1940s, heiress Frances Dodge founded the Dodge Stable. She was the daughter of Michigan automobile pioneer John F. Dodge and a half-sister of Isabel Dodge, owner of the highly successful Brookmeade Stable. In 1945, Frances Dodge, with her husband (polo player and hunter/jumper rider) James B. \\"Jimmy\\" Johnson, purchased Castleton Farm and relocated her Dodge stables there. Their Standardbred breeding operation included two Hambletonian winners and a Little Brown Jug winner. After she married Pennsylvania native Frederick Van Lennep in 1949, the farm underwent major renovations to breed and raise Standardbreds. The Van Lenneps made Castleton Farm one of the pre-eminent operations in both disciplines. Under Mrs. Johnson, Dodge Stables' show horse Wing Commander became a six-time world grand champion, and with her husband, she enjoyed enormous success in harness racing that included a number of Hambletonian and Little Brown Jug victories from horses such as United States Harness Horse of the Year and Harness Racing Museum & Hall of Fame inductee Victory Song (1947), Hambletonian Stakes winners, Hoot Mon (1947), Emily's Pride (1958), and Speedy Scot (1963). Among the other noteworthy harness horses bred by Castleton Stud were Ensign Hanover, winner of the 1946 inaugural Little Brown Jug, and 1972 Jug winner Strike Out, which won in world-record time. Strike Out went on to sire 1979 winner Hot Hitter, bred by Castleton in conjunction with Anthony Tavolacci. 2000s In 2001, Irish businessman and racing enthusiast Tony Ryan acquired Castleton Farm from the Van Lennep Family Trust. Ryan renamed it Castleton Lyons and undertook renovations to the property while returning to its original roots as a Thoroughbred operation. Gravesite The Castleton Farm Cemetery lies at an \\"intersection of two of the tree-lined farm roads, and is an open green space flanked on one end by a 12-ft-high, horseshoe- shaped hedge.\\" It is not only the final resting spot of a number of Standardbred and Saddlebred mares and stallions, including Wing Commander, but also, in unmarked graves, of the Thoroughbred stallions Commando (circa 1898‚Äì1905) and Kingston (circa 1884‚Äì1912).

The programming control structures on which autoparallelization places the most focus are loops, because, in general, most of the execution time of a program takes place inside some form of loop. There are two main approaches to parallelization of loops: pipelined multi-threading and cyclic multi-threading. Simone Campanoni, Timothy Jones, Glenn Holloway, Gu-Yeon Wei, David Brooks. \\"The HELIX Project: Overview and Directions\\". 2012\\\\. For example, consider a loop that on each iteration applies a hundred operations, and runs for a thousand iterations. This can be thought of as a grid of 100 columns by 1000 rows, a total of 100,000 operations. Cyclic multi- threading assigns each row to a different thread. Pipelined multi-threading assigns each column to a different thread. Automatic parallelization technique =Parse= This is the first stage where the scanner will read the input source files to identify all static and extern usages. Each line in the file will be checked against pre-defined patterns to segregate into tokens. These tokens will be stored in a file which will be used later by the grammar engine. The grammar engine will check patterns of tokens that match with pre-defined rules to identify variables, loops, control statements, functions etc. in the code. =Analyze= The analyzer is used to identify sections of code that can be executed concurrently. The analyzer uses the static data information provided by the scanner-parser. The analyzer will first find all the totally independent functions and mark them as individual tasks. The analyzer then finds which tasks have dependencies. =Schedule= The scheduler will list all the tasks and their dependencies on each other in terms of execution and start times. The scheduler will produce the optimal schedule in terms of number of processors to be used or the total execution time for the application. =Code Generation= The scheduler will generate a list of all the tasks and the details of the cores on which they will execute along with the time that they will execute for. The code Generator will insert special constructs in the code that will be read during execution by the scheduler. These constructs will instruct the scheduler on which core a particular task will execute along with the start and end times. Cyclic multi-threading A cyclic multi-threading parallelizing compiler tries to split up a loop so that each iteration can be executed on a separate processor concurrently. =Compiler parallelization analysis= The compiler usually conducts two passes of analysis before actual parallelization in order to determine the following: * Is it safe to parallelize the loop? Answering this question needs accurate dependence analysis and alias analysis * Is it worthwhile to parallelize it? This answer requires a reliable estimation (modeling) of the program workload and the capacity of the parallel system. The first pass of the compiler performs a data dependence analysis of the loop to determine whether each iteration of the loop can be executed independently of the others. Data dependence can sometimes be dealt with, but it may incur additional overhead in the form of message passing, synchronization of shared memory, or some other method of processor communication. The second pass attempts to justify the parallelization effort by comparing the theoretical execution time of the code after parallelization to the code's sequential execution time. Somewhat counterintuitively, code does not always benefit from parallel execution. The extra overhead that can be associated with using multiple processors can eat into the potential speedup of parallelized code. =Example= A loop is called DOALL if all of its iterations, in any given invocation, can be executed concurrently. The Fortran code below is DOALL, and can be auto-parallelized by a compiler because each iteration is independent of the others, and the final result of array \`z\` will be correct regardless of the execution order of the other iterations. do i = 1, n z(i) = x(i) + y(i) enddo There are many pleasingly parallel problems that have such DOALL loops. For example, when rendering a ray-traced movie, each frame of the movie can be independently rendered, and each pixel of a single frame may be independently rendered. On the other hand, the following code cannot be auto-parallelized, because the value of \`z(i)\` depends on the result of the previous iteration, \`z(i - 1)\`. do i = 2, n z(i) = z(i - 1)*2 enddo This does not mean that the code cannot be parallelized. Indeed, it is equivalent to do i = 2, n z(i) = z(1)*2**(i - 1) enddo However, current parallelizing compilers are not usually capable of bringing out these parallelisms automatically, and it is questionable whether this code would benefit from parallelization in the first place. Pipelined multi-threading A pipelined multi-threading parallelizing compiler tries to break up the sequence of operations inside a loop into a series of code blocks, such that each code block can be executed on separate processors concurrently. There are many pleasingly parallel problems that have such relatively independent code blocks, in particular systems using pipes and filters. For example, when producing live broadcast television, the following tasks must be performed many times a second: #Read a frame of raw pixel data from the image sensor, #Do MPEG motion compensation on the raw data, #Entropy compress the motion vectors and other data, #Break up the compressed data into packets, #Add the appropriate error correction and do a FFT to convert the data packets into COFDM signals, and #Send the COFDM signals out the TV antenna. A pipelined multi-threading parallelizing compiler could assign each of these 6 operations to a different processor, perhaps arranged in a systolic array, inserting the appropriate code to forward the output of one processor to the next processor. Recent research focuses on using the power of GPU'sJ Anantpur, R Govindarajan, Runtime dependence computation and execution of loops on heterogeneous systems and multicore systemsX. Zhuang, A. E. Eichenberger, Y. Luo, Kevin O‚ÄôBrien, Kathryn, Exploiting Parallelism with Dependence-Aware Scheduling to compute such independent code blocks( or simply independent iterations of a loop) at runtime. The memory accessed (whether direct or indirect) can be simply marked for different iterations of a loop and can be compared for dependency detection. Using this information, the iterations are grouped into levels such that iterations belonging to the same level are independent of each other, and can be executed in parallel. Difficulties Automatic parallelization by compilers or tools is very difficult due to the following reasons: * dependence analysis is hard for code that uses indirect addressing, pointers, recursion, or indirect function calls because it is difficult to detect such dependencies at compile time; * loops have an unknown number of iterations; * accesses to global resources are difficult to coordinate in terms of memory allocation, I/O, and shared variables; * irregular algorithms that use input- dependent indirection interfere with compile-time analysis and optimization. Workaround Due to the inherent difficulties in full automatic parallelization, several easier approaches exist to get a parallel program in higher quality. They are: * Allow programmers to add \\"hints\\" to their programs to guide compiler parallelization, such as HPF for distributed memory systems and OpenMP or OpenHMPP for shared memory systems. * Build an interactive system between programmers and parallelizing tools/compilers. Notable examples are Vector Fabrics' Pareon, SUIF Explorer (The Stanford University Intermediate Format compiler), the Polaris compiler, and ParaWise (formally CAPTools). * Hardware-supported speculative multithreading. Parallelizing compilers and tools Most research compilers for automatic parallelization consider Fortran programs, because Fortran makes stronger guarantees about aliasing than languages such as C.

History In 1918, the publication of the first edition of Kenkyusha‚Äôs New Japanese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, , named after the editor-in-chief, , was a landmark event in the field of lexicography in Japan. Completed in under five years with the assistance and support of leading scholars in the field, and published when was still a minor academic publishing company, the Takenobu was the most authoritative Japanese‚ÄìEnglish dictionary of the time, and cemented Kenky≈´sha's reputation in the field of academic publishing. In 1931, Kenky≈´sha undertook a major revision in the dictionary by expanding upon former entries and adding newer ones. The British diplomat George Sansom, who later became a renowned historian of Japan, was a major contributor and editor of this edition. Aside from the ever-evolving nature of the Japanese and English languages, competition from two other major dictionaries released in the 1920s ‚Äì Takehara's Japanese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary and Sait≈ç's Japanese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, both of which were larger than the first edition of Kenky≈´sha's ‚Äì was probably a major driving force behind these revisions (although new editions of these dictionaries were never released, allowing Kenky≈´sha's to assert and maintain its dominance among Japanese‚ÄìEnglish dictionaries). From this second edition onward, the dictionary became known as Kenkyusha‚Äôs New Japanese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary. During World War II, reputable institutions in the United States and Great Britain, including Harvard University's Department of Far Eastern Languages, produced pirated versions of this dictionary for the war effort. Because of the Pacific War, Kenky≈´sha did not revise the dictionary for almost 20 years until 1949, when it decided to incorporate the many new borrowings from English that resulted from the American occupation of Japan. After five years of revision, Kenky≈´sha published its third edition in 1954. Beginning with this edition and continuing through the 1974 fourth edition, the editors attempted to make the dictionary into a more scholarly work by citing English language expressions from English texts, particularly from literature; this, however, resulted in clumsy, artificial-sounding Japanese and English. The editors abandoned this practice for the fifth edition, which has entries that sound more natural to both native-Japanese and native-English speakers.

Furthermore, the organization of the words has changed from an alphabetical romaji-style system () to the kana-based system () that is most commonly used in Japanese dictionaries and encyclopedias. This change reflects the fact that most users of the dictionary are native speakers of Japanese, who are more comfortable with the kana-based lookup system. Other new features are: * Larger numbers of katakana words and onomatopoeia words (e.g. perapera, nikoniko) * More colloquial slang and pop culture words (a new definition: Ob- LA-Di Ob-La-Da) * More specialized scientific and technological words (especially related to the recent Internet boom) * More names of famous people, places, works of art, works of literature, etc. * English translations that are more up-to-date and idiomatic, reflecting the greater participation of native English-speaking editors in the editorial process than for previous editions The definitions themselves are also more expansive and detailed, as they often now include sample sentences. * For example, under the definition for (off-season), a katakana word borrowed from English: ** The off-season rates are much lower at that hotel. Furthermore, there are also accompanying pictures and diagrams for words such as (horse) and (soccer). At the end of the dictionary, there are some useful resources such as the entire Japanese Constitution; a chronological list of dates in Japanese history dating all the way back to the Stone Age; a chronological list of dates in world history dating all the way back to the early civilizations that developed in Mesopotamia, the Nile valley, the Indus valley, and the Yellow River valley; charts on the proper formats of notices, envelopes, application letters, resumes, etc.; a section on email lingo and abbreviations; a section on the proper format of business cards; a section the proper format of help-wanted ads; a section on Japanese government titles; a section on American government titles; a chart on pronouncing Japanese kanji in Chinese; charts on the hierarchical organization of the Self-Defense Forces, the old Japanese military, the American military, and the English military; a chart on the names of all the countries in the world (along with currencies and measurement systems); and finally, a conversion chart between U.S. systems of measurement and the metric system. The online version of the dictionary, available for a fee, is being updated on a monthly basis with new words and expanded entries.

History King was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States. He is the son of blues musician Tabby Thomas. He has won awards including \\"Album of the Year\\" for both Grammy Award and Country Music Awards. King has sold more than 10 million records in the United States. He is featured playing the part of Tommy Johnson in the Coen brothers' 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou?. He is also featured in Down from the Mountain and More Music from Ray soundtracks. Artistic career King is known as the pioneer of rap/blues fusion. He conceived the first sample-based blues concept album in the early 1990s by writing and producing the first all-rap/blues album for RCA Records titled 21st Century Blues‚Ä¶ from da Hood. As an entrepreneur King took control of his master recordings in the early 1990s, forming 21st Century Blues Records. He also established a publishing company, Young Blues Rebel, LLC. 21st Century Records signed the New Orleans Ninth Ward rap/blues duo the 21C-B-Boyz and the London, England-based NuBlues, to 21st Century Blues Records in 2003. King's acting career includes prominent roles in several films, including two music- related films. In the Oscar-winning film Ray he plays band leader and blues guitar player Lowell Fulson. During production he collaborated with Ray Charles in scoring the film. In O Brother Where Art Thou?, he portrays a skilled blues guitarist who claims he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for his skill on guitar. The character is based on blues musicians Tommy Johnson and Robert Johnson, both of whom have been linked to selling their soul to the devil at a rural Mississippi crossroads. King also accompanies the film's band the Soggy Bottom Boys on guitar; his rendition of \\"Hard Time Killing Floor Blues\\" was recorded live during filming and included on the film's Grammy-award-winning soundtrack.

Video showing how a supplemental nursing system is used A supplemental nursing system (SNS), also known as a lactation aid, is a device that consists of a container and a capillary tube. It is used to provide additional nutrients to a baby whose mother has low milk supply. During breastfeeding, the end of the tube is placed alongside the mother's nipple so that both the tube and the breast are in the infant's mouth. The SNS container can be filled with pumped breastmilk, donor milk, or with infant formula. The tubing is usually attached with removable tape. When the newborn infant suckles on the breast, the infant is nourished both by fluid from the capillary tube and by the mother's breastmilk from the nipple. The mother's milk supply is stimulated by the infant suckling, and in most cases the use of the SNS can be discontinued in a few days or weeks when the mother's milk supply has risen to meet the infant's needs. Mothers usually obtain SNS supplies from a lactation consultant. Images File:SNS (supplemental nursing system) supplies.jpgEquipment for supplemental nursing system using syringe.

Born in Burdwan, Bengal, Perowne was a member of a notable clerical family, whose origins were Huguenot. Life He was educated at Norwich School, and at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, becoming a fellow in 1849 and where his brother Edward was later Master. After holding a chair in King's College London, he became, in 1862, the fourth vice-principal of St Davids College, Lampeter, a college with which he was already familiar, for he had been external examiner between 1851 and 1852. The ageing Principal of the college took a back seat, and Perowne effectively 'took the reins' until his departure from Lampeter in 1872. In 1868 he was elected Hulsean lecturer, taking as his subject Immortality or rather conditional immortality; stating \\"The immortality of the soul is a phantom which eludes your eager grasp.\\". He was elected canon of Llandaff in 1869, dean of Peterborough 1878, and in 1891 succeeded Henry Philpott as bishop of Worcester. Whilst at Lampeter, Perowne had gained a great respect for the theology of his predecessor in the role of Vice-Principal, Rowland Williams, and when he became a bishop, he went to great lengths to avoid taking action against modernists in the church. Indeed, a work by one of his incumbents, which denied the Trinity, the Virgin Birth, the Divinity of Christ, the Atonement, and the concepts of the Resurrection of Christ and the Ascension was described by Perowne as 'an honest attempt to deal with great spiritual problems' . He resigned his see in late 1901. Perowne was a respected Hebrew scholar of the traditional type and sat on the Old Testament Revision Committee. He is best remembered as the general editor of the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges. His chief works were a Commentary on the Book of Psalms (2 vols., 1864‚Äì1868) and a life of Bishop Thirlwall (1877‚Äì1878). Descendants Perowne married Anne Maria, daughter of Humphry William Woolrych, before moving to Wales in 1862. His son Arthur William Thomson Perowne, became the first Bishop of Bradford, and subsequently Bishop of Worcester. Another son was John Thomas Woolrych Perowne, a British Army officer, King's Messenger and Gold Staff Officer. One of his grandsons, Stewart Perowne, married Freya Stark and was the more famous as Head of Education in British Palestine, archaeologist, explorer, and writer. Stewart's brother Leslie was sometime Head of Music at the BBC and was responsible for bringing Albert Ket√®lbey out of retirement to conduct a huge BBC Ket√®lbey Concert at the Royal Albert Hall prior to World War II.

Despite his homosexuality, in 1947 he married the explorer and travel writer Freya Stark. The marriage was dissolved in 1952. Early life Born in Hallow, Worcestershire, into a distinguished ecclesiastical family, Stewart Perowne was the grandson of John Perowne, the Bishop of Worcester, and the son of Helena Frances (n√©e Oldnall-Russell) (1869‚Äì1922) and Arthur William Thomson Perowne, who was the first Bishop of Bradford and subsequently also Bishop of Worcester. His older brother was Francis Edward Perowne (1898‚Äì1988). His younger brother, Leslie Arthur Perowne (1906‚Äì1997), was Head of Music at the BBC and was responsible for bringing Albert Ket√®lbey out of retirement to conduct a huge BBC Ket√®lbey Concert at the Royal Albert Hall prior to World War II. Perowne was educated at Haileybury College, where he was a champion sprinter, and at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied Classical Archaeology and Architecture.Geniesse, Jane Fletcher Freya Stark Passionate Nomad Random House, Inc (2000) (p. 328) Google Books He then studied at Harvard where he gained a graduate degree in Classics. He went to Palestine in 1927 under the British Mandate, as Head of Education in the Palestine Government Education Service, teaching at the Anglican St George's School in Jerusalem. He became fluent in spoken and written Arabic. In 1930 Perowne transferred to the administrative branch of the Palestine Government, working for a time as Assistant District Commissioner for Galilee.E. C. Hodgkin, 'Perowne, Stewart Henry (1901‚Äì1989)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press (2004) accessed 26 September 2012 In 1931 he was appointed an Officer of the Venerable Order of Saint John.Perowne in the London Gazette 23 June 1931 (p. 4072) Diplomatic career Perowne and Freya Stark on their wedding day in 1947 Perowne later served in Malta, Aden, Iraq, Barbados, Libya and Israel.Perowne's obituary in The New York Times 16 May 1989 He was awarded the Coronation Medal in 1937. In 1938 Perowne worked for the BBC, preparing talks and features for transmission by the overseas Arabic service. In the same year he deposited a collection of potsherds with the British Museum, most of which are of Bronze Age type and probably derive from the ancient site of Subr. In 1939 he was appointed Public Information Officer in Aden, where he developed a passion for archaeology, and where he discovered the seventh century BC sites of Imadiya and Beihan.Perowne, Stewart 'Im'adiya and Beihan, Aden Protectorate', Antiquity No. 13 (1939), pp. 133‚Äì37) In 1941 Perowne was appointed Public Relations Officer to the British embassy in Baghdad. In 1944 he succeeded the scholar Vyvyan Holt as oriental counsellor. During his diplomatic postings he designed stamps for Malta (1936), the Aden Protectorate (1938), Barbados (1949), Libya (1951), and currency notes for the West Indies Federation (1949) and Libya (1951). Marriage Because of his career as a diplomat it was expected that Perowne should marry. As a homosexual he decided to embark on a mariage blanc, and on 7 October 1947 he married the explorer and travel writer Freya Stark at St Margaret's church in Westminster. She was his senior by eight years and had been his assistant in Yemen when he was Information Officer. Stark's biographer has argued that she may not have known of Perowne's homosexuality, and of his taste for men in uniform.M. Izzard, Freya Stark: a biography (1993)Geniesse, p. 295'Travelling tales of a reluctant virgin' The Observer 5 December 1999 \\"In 1947 people's sexual proclivities were still part of their private lives and ‚Ä¶ no one among Freya's friends seemed able to warn her of the pitfalls of marriage to a homosexual.\\"Izzard, p. 210 Confused as to why Perowne would not sleep with her, she wrote to him, \\"I think you have left something lying between us, untold. Whatever it is, it will not make me think less of you or care less for you.\\" Eventually, after skirting around the subject, he wrote to her: > It is difficult to say what \\"normal\\" is ‚Äì my friend a counsellor of St. > George's Hospital always refuses to use the word and in both men and women, > you have a wide and graded range from ultra-male to ultra-female with > naturally most people in the middle ranges ...

Later years In 1947 Perowne was appointed Colonial Secretary to Barbados where he was a member of the island's Legislative CouncilPerowne in the London Gazette (p. 273) before becoming political adviser in Cyrenaica from 1950 to 1951. Here he discovered the ancient city-site of Aziris. Taking early retirement in 1951, after his divorce in 1952 he returned to Palestine, now the State of Israel, where he assisted Weston Henry Stewart, the Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem in designing and organising model villages for Palestinian Arabs who had been made refugees as a result of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. He was an Adviser to the UK delegation to the UN Assembly in Paris in November 1951.Perowne on the British Museum Collection Database During this period he also began to write, his first book being Jerusalem, The One Remains (1954). Later books included The Life and Times of Herod the Great (1958), The Later Herods (1958), Hadrian (1960), Caesars and Saints (1962), The End of the Roman World (1966), and The Death of the Roman Republic (1969). Other books among the 18 he wrote include guides to Athens, Jerusalem, Rome and Malta. In addition, he was a frequent contributor to various edited works, encyclopaedias and academic journals, including Antiquity. Perowne was appointed OBE in 1944 and a Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John (KStJ) in 1955.Perowne in the London Gazette 7 January 1955 (p. 158) In 1957 he was named Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (FSA). He was a Member of the Church of England Foreign Relations Council and a long-standing member of the famous Travellers' Club in Pall Mall, London.Travellers' Club Membership Book, published 1992. Perowne's closing years were spent in the Distressed Gentlefolks' Aid Association's care home in Vicarage Gate, Kensington, London. He died in 1989 at Charing Cross Hospital in London aged 87 years old. He was survived by his former wife, Freya Stark.

As such, the Island is part of Berlin's 7th administrative borough, Tempelhof-Sch√∂neberg. Overview On the Berlin city map, the neighborhood is easily located within a distinctive triangle bordered by railway lines in the southwestern corner of the city center. Owing to the large trenches dug to accommodate the tracks for trains and light-rail, the only way to access this part of Sch√∂neberg is by crossing one of the many bridges that span the tracks, thus forming the area into an \\"island\\". Additionally, the comparative isolation from the adjoining parts of Berlin is also an important reason for the area's being considered insular. It is especially notable for its peculiar history, and is rather indicative of the sharp contrasts that modern German history since 1871 abounds with. Up until the end of World War I, roughly half of the Island's territory was marked by its extensive use by the Prussian army, whereas the other half was a distinctively working-class residential district, dominated by voters of left-wing parties (hence the \\"red\\"). As the Island survived the allied air raids during World War II virtually intact, it has managed to maintain a great deal of its distinctive flavor to the present day. It is nowadays a rather mixed neighborhood that is populated by residents from fairly varied ethnic backgrounds, with a certain unobtrusive Boh√®me charm to it, but lacking the slightly exalted mannerisms so typical for the \\"hipper\\" quarters of post-reunification Berlin. The most famous celebrity associated with the neighborhood is Marlene Dietrich, who was born in Leberstrasse 65 (then called Sedanstrasse) on December 27, 1901. The actress and singer Hildegard Knef, lived in the same street where Dietrich was born, in Leberstrasse 33. To this day, both women are very much a part of the local folklore of the island. Alfred Lion, known among jazz aficionados as founder of the legendary Blue Note record label, was also born in the neighborhood.

The festival takes place on the Cannstatter Wasen, traditional fairgrounds in Stuttgart's Bad Cannstatt district. It is slightly smaller than the festival in the autumn (and therefore occasionally also called the \\"small Wasen\\"), but it is the largest spring festival in Europe. Like the autumn fair, the Fr√ºhlingsfest offers a variety of fairground attractions. The tallest attraction is the 47 metre Ferris wheel and the fair almost invariably features a major roller coaster. The Fr√ºhlingsfest starts on a Saturday with the traditional opening of a beer barrel by the Stuttgart mayor. The Fruit Column, a tall wooden structure decorated with fruits, was introduced to the Stuttgarter Fr√ºhlingsfest in 1995. Originally it was only present at the autumn Volksfest but in 1995 it was left to stand on the festival site all year round. However, in recent years, this practice was changed and once again the column began to be dismantled in the autumn of each year, leaving just the base. This carries a large can during the Stuttgarter Fr√ºhlingsfest.

Lead(II) oxide (formula: PbO) can occur in one of two lattice formats, orthorhombic and tetragonal. The tetragonal form is called litharge. PbO can be changed from massicot to litharge (or vice versa) by controlled heating and cooling. At room temperature massicot forms soft (Mohs hardness of 2) yellow to reddish-yellow, earthy, scaley masses which are very dense, with a specific gravity of 9.64. Massicot can be found as a natural mineral, though it is only found in minor quantities. In bygone centuries it was mined. Nowadays massicot arises during industrial processing of lead and lead oxides,A simple example is given in A Text Book of Inorganic Chemistry, by Anil Kumar De, year 2007, page 383. A more complex example is in The Chemistry of Metal Alkoxides, published by Kluwer Academic Publishers, year 2002, section 9.4 on lead alkoxides, page 115. especially in the glass industry, which is the biggest user of PbO. The definition of massicot as orthorhombic PbO dates from the 1840s, but the substance massicot and the name massicot has been in use since the late medieval era.Some comments about the evolution of the definition of the word massicot over the past few centuries is in Lead Manufacturing in Britain: A History, by David John Rowe, year 1983, page 16. The word is in Italian and French in the late medieval era meaning naturally occurring massicot and in some records more vaguely a lead-based ceramics glaze that may or may not have been massicot. There is some evidence that the ancient Romans used the substance.Archaeomineralogy, by George Robert Rapp, year 2002, page 173, says three lead oxides were known to the ancient Romans: minium, litharge, and massicot. It may occur as an oxidation product of other lead- bearing minerals such as galena, bournonite, boulangerite, either naturally or in industrial processing. When massicot is found in a natural environment, some other minerals that may be found with it may include cerussite, litharge, minium, wulfenite, oxides of antimony and limonite.

Four of Baseball Prospectus's current regular writers are members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America and thus eligible to vote for nominees for Major League Baseball's post-season awards and the Baseball Hall of Fame.Former BP writer Keith Law, who writes for ESPN.com, is also a member of the BBWAA. Prospectus Entertainment Ventures, LLC Baseball Prospectus is formally an entity of Prospectus Entertainment Ventures, LLC, a private corporation that runs websites and publishes books focusing on the statistical analysis of the sports of baseball, basketball, and hockey. As of August 2014, the President & CEO is Joe Hamrahi, and Vice President is Dave Pease.BP masthead. For several years, Prospectus Entertainment Ventures (PEV) partnered with Football Outsiders for the publication and promotion of Football Outsiders Almanac (), before 2009 called Pro Football Prospectus (). On October 10, 2007, PEV launched Basketball Prospectus, a new website for the analysis of men's college and pro basketball, with Joe Sheehan taking the role of Managing Editor and announcing the lineup of principal writer-analysts for the site. Initially, this website did not require a subscription for access, but it introduced subscriptions in 2011 for access to most of the material on the site. BasketballProspectus.coms first annual book, College Basketball Prospectus 2008‚Äì2009 (), was published in October 2008. It released Pro Basketball Prospectus 2009‚Äì10 for purchase online in October 2009.Kevin Pelton and Bradford Doolittle, \\"Pro Basketball Prospectus, 2009‚Äì10: Our Newest Book\\", BasketballProspectus (September 2, 2009). Subsequently, it published both College Basketball Prospectus 2010‚Äì11 () and Pro Basketball Prospectus 2010‚Äì11 () in both print and online (PDF) modes. On March 19, 2008, Imagine Sports announced a strategic partnership with PEV and Baseball Prospectus. Imagine sports owns the baseball simulation engine \\"Diamond Mind Baseball\\".Imagine Sports strategic partnership. On October 14, 2008, PEV announced the acquisition of Baseball Digest Daily (BDD), an online blog devoted to baseball analysis and statistics. Joe Hamrahi, new Chief Financial Officer of PEV and founder of BDD, reported that \\"PEV's decision to acquire Baseball Digest Daily further enhances the content offerings of Baseball Prospectus by adding some of the game's best analysts as well as over 100 pages of baseball news and original content. In addition, BDD's player tracker provides a platform for serious fans and fantasy baseball enthusiasts to easily monitor the progress of their teams, allowing users to manipulate and track the progress of an unlimited set of players over a customized period of time\\".Press Release: \\"Prospectus Entertainment Ventures (Owner of Baseball Prospectus) Announces Acquisition of Baseball Digest Daily (BDD)\\", by Joe Hamrahi, Tuesday, October 14, 2008. At the same time, PEV revealed publicly that it \\"owns a significant interest in 538 (www.fivethirtyeight.com), a political analysis website that generates over 700,000 unique visitors daily.\\" On February 23, 2009, Prospectus Entertainment Ventures (PEV) launched the website Puck Prospectus with the intent of providing cutting-edge analysis of hockey. Will Carroll assumed the role of the Executive Editor, and Andrew Rothstein, the founder of Puck Prospectus, assumed the role of the Managing Editor. Puck Prospectus published its first annual book, Puck Prospectus 2010‚Äì2011 () in both online and print formats. Initially a free site, Puck Prospectus introduced subscriptions in 2011. On March 24, 2009, Baseball Prospectus announced that Nate Silver was stepping down as its Managing Partner, and Kevin Goldstein was assuming this role. At that time, PEV relinquished its previously announced financial interest in Silver's FiveThirtyEight blog. At the same time, it was announced that BP has a partnership relationship with ESPN.com.Nate Silver and Kevin Goldstein, \\"State of the Prospectus: Spring 2009\\", BaseballProspectus.com, March 24, 2009 . In January 2010, PEV's Managing Partner Kevin Goldstein reported that one of BP's founding members, Joe Sheehan, had departed the organization.Kevin Goldstein, \\"State of the Prospectus: The Year and the Decade to Come\\", BaseballProspectus.com, January 4, 2010. He reported that John Perrotto had been elevated to full-time status on the BP staff and would become the new Editor-in-Chief of BaseballProspectus.com, taking over that responsibility from Christina Kahrl. And he reported that Jeff Euston was joining the BP staff and that Euston's Cot's Baseball Contracts website would be joining the Baseball Prospectus family. In February 2011, Perrotto was replaced as Editor- in-Chief by Steven Goldman. In February 2010, BP's \\"Fantasy Manager\\" Marc Normandin announced that BP had established a partnership with Heater Magazine.Marc Normandin, \\"The New BP Fantasy\\", BaseballProspectus.com, February 25, 2010. Heater Magazine ceased publication after the 2010 season. In November 2011, Kevin Goldstein announced that he was stepping down as PEV's Managing Partner in favor of Joe Hamrahi.Kevin Goldstein, \\"Organizational Announcement\\", BaseballProspectus.com, November 28, 2012. On March 3, 2012, Hamrahi announced that Steven Goldman was stepping down as Editor-in-Chief of BaseballProspectus.com; Goldman had taken a position as a lead baseball writer for Bleacher Report.Joe Hamrahi, \\"Thank you, Steven Goldman\\", BaseballProspectus.com, March 2, 2012. Ben Lindbergh was named Managing Editor of Baseball Prospectus on March 5, 2012Joe Hamrahi, \\"BP Names New Managing Editor\\", BaseballProspectus.com, March 5, 2012 and Editor-in-Chief of Baseball Prospectus on July 13, 2012.Joe Hamrahi, \\"Lindbergh and Evans Help Chart New Course for BP\\", BaseballProspectus.com, July 13, 2012 On April 30, 2012, PEV's Managing Partner Joe Hamrahi announced that \\"Dan Brooks, Harry Pavlidis, and Brooks Baseball have agreed to team up and join forces with Baseball Prospectus. BrooksBaseball.net is the premier site for PITCHf/x analysis and pitch classification\\".Joe Hamrahi, \\"Brooks Baseball Joins Forces with Baseball Prospectus\\", BaseballProspectus.com, April 30, 2012. On March 15, 2013, after explaining a week earlier that its key staff of writers had been hired away by ESPN, Baseball Prospectus's Dave Pease declared in response to a question in the comments: \\"Basketball Prospectus will not be publishing any new content. We are going quiet. The archives will remain available. Thank you\\".Dave Pease, \\"State of Basketball Prospectus: A Brief Announcement Basketball Prospectus.com, March 15, 2013 . On March 8, Pease had written: \\"You've probably noticed our Basketball Prospectus Premium coverage has been pretty quiet lately. You may have also noticed that our core pro writers, Kevin Pelton, Bradford Doolittle, and John Gasaway are now writing for ESPN Insider on a regular basis. Late last year, we learned that, following their completion of the Pro Basketball Prospectus 2012‚Äì13 and College Basketball Prospectus 2012‚Äì13 annuals, Kevin, Bradford, and John would be moving to ESPN on a full-time basis\\". History of Baseball Prospectus Baseball Prospectus (sometimes referred to as BP) was founded in 1996 by Gary Huckabay, who recruited the initial contributor group of Clay Davenport, Rany Jazayerli, Christina Kahrl, and Joe Sheehan, with the publication of the first annual set of forecasts. \\"That first year, BP charged $20 for a statistics guide produced on a photocopier. It printed around 300 copies and sold about 170 to fellow statheads, even though the book was missing the St. Louis Cardinals. 'It was terrible,' recalls Kahrl, 'but it nevertheless didn't discourage us.' Within a few years Brassey's Inc. published the guide, which grew to about 3,000 copies. By 2007 it reached The New York Times bestseller list, topping 70,000 copies at $21.95 a pop.\\"Zak Stambor, \\"Number Cruncher\\", University of Chicago Magazine, July‚ÄìAugust 2008. The kind of sabermetric approach favored by Baseball Prospectus has gained significant acceptance by the management of many Major League Baseball clubs, notably the Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians. BP has often been considered the modern successor to Bill James' Baseball Abstract series of books in the 1980s.See, for example, James Fraser, \\"'Baseball Prospectus' ‚Äî Escaping Bill James' Shadow\\", By the Numbers (Newsletter of the SABR Statistical Analysis Committee) 10, No. 2 (May 2000). Reflecting its legacy as a group of sabermetricians who met over the Internet, BP has no \\"main office.\\" Working for BP is a second or part-time job for many of the regular staff, who conduct their work for BP in their own home offices. The website BaseballProspectus.com began in 1997 primarily as a way to present original sabermetric research; publish advanced baseball statistics such as EqA, the Davenport Translations (DT's), and VORP; and promote sales of the annual book.Dave Pease, \\"Welcome to Big September\\", BaseballProspectus.com, September 19, 2011: \\"On September 19, 1996, we registered the domain name baseballprospectus.com. At the time, the main reason we wanted the site is so all our Usenet friends and customers could get more information about the Baseball Prospectus annual, which we'd just self-published with an imposing print run of about 200\\". Beginning in 2003, the site placed most of its new articles, its PECOTA forecasts, and some of its statistical databases in a \\"premium\\" section that could be accessed only by subscription. However, in May 2011, BP \\"announced it has made its entire archive of premium and fantasy content over one year old completely and permanently free to the public\\".\\"Press Release: BP Announces Free Access to Archives\\", BaseballProspectus.com, May 23, 2011. Until 2007, when the site began to post general advertising, the premium subscriptions and book sales were Baseball Prospectus' main source of revenues. Baseball Prospectus does not publish a financial report or information about its subscriber base, but it appears to have used its income to expand its breadth of coverage,Nate Silver, \\"The State of the Prospectus: Now Serving Beer ... and Tacos\\", BaseballProspectus.com, February 27, 2006; and Nate Silver, \\"State of the Prospectus: New Features\\", BaseballProspectus.com, December 1, 2006. and it has not increased its subscription prices since initiating its premium service. It also offers a subscription to those interested in fantasy baseball, at a lower price than the premium subscriptions and giving access to fewer features and articles. BaseballProspectus.com has a corps of staff writers who publish articles on a regular (typically weekly) basis under a featured heading. In addition, occasional articles are published by other BP staff or freelance authors. Some former regular writers no longer appear on the site but are employed on the staffs of major league baseball organizations, including as of 2014 Keith Woolner (Cleveland Indians),Keith Woolner is Manager of Baseball Research & Analytics for the Indians. From 2001 to 2007 he wrote \\"Aim For The Head\\" columns for BP.com. Woolner invented Value over replacement player and a variation on Pitcher Abuse Points. Woolner left BP in May 2007 to join the front office of the Cleveland Indians. James Click (Tampa Bay Rays),James Click is a Coordinator of Baseball Operations and Chaim Bloom is Assistant Director of Minor League Operations for the Tampa Bay Rays. Dan Fox (Pittsburgh Pirates),Dan Fox joined the Pirates front office in April 2008 to become their Director of Player Systems Development. See Dan Fox, \\"Schrodinger's Bat: Opus 100\\", BaseballProspectus.com, April 17, 2008. As evidence of what Fox is doing for the Pirates, see this article on Fox's MITT . Mike Fast (Houston Astros),Aaron Gleeman, \\"Astros hire Baseball Prospectus analysis Mike Fast, HardballTalk.com, January 24, 2012. Kevin Goldstein (Houston Astros),In 2012 Goldstein became the Pro Scouting Coordinator for the Astros. See Kevin Goldstein, \\"Goodbye to the Internet\\", BaseballProspectus.com August 31, 2012. and Colin Wyers (Houston Astros). In addition, Keith Law, now a columnist for The Athletic, in 2002 moved from Baseball Prospectus to work on player evaluation in the front office of the Toronto Blue Jays. In 2009, Nate Silver turned his full attention to his FiveThirtyEight political analysis website; he resigned his executive post at BP and handed over management of PECOTA to other BP staff. Given the competing career opportunities for some of BP's best-known and most statistics-savvy analysts, maintaining a fresh supply of sabermetrically sophisticated writers remains a challenge.Josh Levin, \\"Moneyball's Deep: How Baseball Prospectus is Like the Oakland A's\\", Deadspin, June 5, 2009. During the 2009 baseball season, BP ran a multi-week open talent search competition in the spirit of the popular television program American Idol, in which aspiring writers submitted articles for evaluation by BP's staff members, with one contestant a week from among the final ten selected by the staff then voted off by the subscribers. At least three new regular BP writers (winner Ken Funck, Tim Kniker, and Matt Swartz) were discovered through this Prospectus Idol contest.\\"Prospectus Idol: Meet the Finalists\\", BaseballProspectus.com, May 17, 2009. In addition, BP had added Eric Seidman to its staff early in 2009 and then acquired Russell Carleton (\\"Pizza Cutter\\") and Colin Wyers in December 2009 to bolster its coverage of technical sabermetric issues. As late as the Fall of 2008, Seidman, Swartz, Carleton, Wyers, Daniel Novick and BP Idol finalist Brian Cartwright made up the entire staff of \\"Statistically Speaking\\" aka StatSpeak at MVN.com.The MVN.com network went belly up in December 2009 for financial reasons. See Evan Brunell, \\"The End of the Most Valuable Network, MVN.com\\", EvanBrunnel.com, December 7, 2009. Carleton left the BP staff in May 2010, but returned in July 2012. Seidman and Swartz left in February 2011. Wyers was hired away by the Houston Astros in October 2013. In the press release announcing his hire, Jeff Luhnow noted, \\"Colin Wyers is a brilliant man with lots of well thought-out, practical, ideas. He is insuring the financial security of this company for years to come. Oh yes, and his personal hygiene is above reproach\\". Wyers' final article for BP reviewed the history and process of the \\"brain drain\\" of sabermetricians as writers to baseball analytics specialists working for Major League Baseball itself: \\"Colleges can crank out people who know and understand the tools, but the sabermetrics community has given teams people who have demonstrated that they can use those tools to find useful insights into the game of baseball. So teams court them as part of their effort to win games\\".Colin Wyers, \\"Manufactured Runs: Moments of Transition, Moments of Revelation\\", Baseball Prospectus, November 1, 2013. Although the site maintains a strong sabermetric core and has expanded its statistical databases, it regularly attends to issues such as baseball prospects (the First Year Player Draft and minor league baseball), international baseball, the economics and business of baseball (valuation of players, team and stadium finances, the player marketplace),This carries on the tradition established by the late Doug Pappas, who wrote regularly for BP from 2001 until his untimely death in 2004. and fantasy baseball (PECOTA, the \\"Fantasy Focus\\" series of articles, forecast manager and other fantasy tools). BP HAS also published monographs on specialized topics, including the application of sabermetric analysis to historical topics ‚Äì an emphasis clearly seen in Mind Game (2005 ‚Äì a history of the Boston Red Sox), Baseball Between the Numbers (2006 ‚Äì which addresses some historical comparisons), and It Ain't Over 'til It's Over (2007 ‚Äì about historical pennant races). By the beginning of the 2011 baseball season, none of BP's founders was an active contributor to the website or publications, though some of their earlier articles were included in two Best of Baseball Prospectus compendia that were published in 2011. BP products Baseball Prospectus creates several products: =Website= *The website www.baseballprospectus.com, which contains articles, statistical reports, and fantasy baseball tools. The site contains some free content, although it has become increasingly available only by paid subscription. Authors write regular bylined columns on the site and numerous other writers contribute occasional articles. The site also covers baseball history as well as current issues and events, including games and series, injuries, forecasts, player profiles, baseball finance, and the player marketplace.Tim Lemke, \\"Baseball Prospectus Finds Niche\\", The Washington Times (December 10, 2006). =BP annual and Futures Guide= * Every year, BP publishes a print guide to the upcoming baseball season, called the \\"annual.\\" The annual contains essays on each team and other topics, as well as PECOTA projections and analysis for every Major League player and many prospects. BP also publishes a separate annual Futures Guide with extensive reporting on minor league and amateur prospects. =Other books= * Other baseball-related books, such as Mind Game: How the Boston Red Sox Got Smart, Won a World Series, and Created a New Blueprint for Winning (2005) () and Baseball Between the Numbers (2006) (). The latter was chosen by the editors of Amazon.com as the best book on baseball (and third best on sports in general) published in 2006. =Podcasts= * Effectively Wild, the daily Baseball Prospectus podcast, ran on the site until episode 1006, when Sam Miller left to join ESPN. As of August 2020, the podcast continues on FanGraphs and is hosted by Miller, former BP editor-in-chief Ben Lindbergh and FanGraphs managing editor Meg Rowley. * Flags Fly Forever, a traditional fantasy baseball league-focused podcast, has run weekly since January 2014. * Five and Dive, a twice-weekly podcast on various baseball topics hosted by BP editor-in-chief Craig Goldstein, Sports Illustrated writer Emma Baccellieri, and Bradford William Davis of the New York Daily News. * For All You Kids Out There, a weekly podcast focusing on the New York Mets organization hosted by BP writers Jeffrey Paternostro and Jarrett Seidler. * Stolen Signs, a podcast on baseball statistics and the people who develop them hosted by Kendall Guillemette and Harry Pavlidis. * The Infinite Inning, a weekly podcast on the intersection of baseball and culture hosted by BP writer Steven Goldman. * Three-Quarters Delivery, a weekly podcast on minor league baseball and player development. * TINO (There Is No Offseason) a dynasty league fantasy baseball podcast, has run regularly since January 2014. =Internet Baseball Awards= * The annual Internet Baseball Awards (IBA) are based on fan voting. They started in 1991 with the Most Valuable Player, Cy Young (pitcher), and Rookie of the Year awards, in each of the two major leagues. In 1998, an award for Manager of the Year was added in each league. Theories Baseball Prospectus writers promote several theories on proper baseball management and analysis, many of which are contrary to those of conventional baseball wisdom. =Clutch hitting= Baseball Prospectus researchers have concluded that there is no repeatable ability of clutch hitting. As writer Joe Sheehan said, \\"Over the course of a game, a month, a season or a career, there is virtually no evidence that any player or group of players possesses an ability to outperform his established level of ability in clutch situations, however defined.\\" They cite studies which find that there is insignificant correlation between year-to-year performance in clutch situations. In an article published in 2006, Nate Silver argued that clutch hitting ability does exist to a degree. He argued that although not as important as traditional baseball analysis would suggest, clutch hitting ability was more significant than other sabermetric studies had shown. The article also found there to be a connection between clutch hitting ability and situational hitting, or the ability to adjust a hitting approach to fit the given situation. =Views on traditional statistics= Baseball Prospectus writers often successfully argue that traditional baseball statistics such as RBIs, wins, and batting average are poor reflections of a player's true contributions. For example, they have argued that RBIs are too dependent on factors outside of the player's control, namely the production of other hitters in the lineup. They similarly argue that wins are too affected by factors such as the team's offense and bullpen. =Closer usage= Baseball Prospectus writers assert that teams are typically inefficient in their use of their best relievers. Teams typically assign their most effective reliever to the position of closer, using him in only save situations. According to many Baseball Prospectus writers, a team's best reliever should be used when the opposing team has its best chance at increasing its chances of winning. =Views on sacrifice bunts and stolen bases= Many writers argue that the sacrifice bunt and stolen base are overused in baseball. Teams will often attempt these plays when the score is close. Writers for Baseball Prospectus often argue that teams are, on average, actually lowering their expected number of runs scored. They argue that stolen base attempts are not completed frequently enough for them to be beneficial to the offense. For sacrifice bunts, they argue that the team is giving up more by sacrificing an out than they gain by advancing a runner one base. Their thinking is derived from the grid of expected runs in an inning based on the outs and runner situation, which shows that the sacrifice is detrimental to a team given average players in most of the situations in which it is typically used.Run expectancy matrix available here for all users and here for paid subscribers. In a series of articles in 2004, James Click argued that sacrifice bunts are beneficial in some situations, dependent on the quality of the batter at the plate and the situation in the game. Statistical tools Baseball Prospectus writers use a wide variety of sabermetric tools. Among the major tools that they are credited with inventing are: *Equivalent average (EqA) ‚Äì a combination of various hitting numbers designed to express a player's overall offensive contribution. *Equivalent Baserunning Runs (EqBRR) ‚Äì a statistic indicating a player's rate of run production resulting from his baserunning.This new statistic was incorporated into BP's regular daily and seasonal statistical reports effective with the 2008 season but also calculated for previous seasons. It has also been incorporated into PECOTA estimates for 2008. The fundamental work on this metric was developed in a series of columns by Dan Fox. See, for example, Dan Fox, Schrodinger's Bat: The Running Man\\", BaseballProspectus.com, September 7, 2006, \\"Schrodinger's Bat: The Baserunning Edition\\", Baseball Prospectus, October 18, 2007, and \\"A Running Comparison\\", Baseball Prospectus/Unfiltered, November 14, 2007. Also see Dan Fox, \\"The Tortoise, the Hare, and Juan Pierre: Translating Baserunning into Runs\\", in S. Goldman and C. Kahrl, Eds., Baseball Prospectus 2008 (New York: Plume, 2008): 558‚Äì563. *Jaffe Wins Above Replacement Score (JAWS) ‚Äì a metric \\"invented by Jay Jaffe to assess a player's worthiness for enshrinement in the Hall of Fame.\\" *Pitcher Abuse Points (PAP) ‚Äì a measure of the impact of a particular start by a pitcher on his arm, based on pitch count. *Peripheral ERA (PERA) ‚Äì a pitcher's expected ERA based on park-adjusted hits, walks, strikeouts, and home runs allowed. *PECOTA ‚Äì a system of player projection based on similarity to previous player seasons. *Value over replacement player (VORP) ‚Äì a measurement of the number of runs contributed by a player over the expected level of performance the average team can obtain if it needs to replace a starting player at minimal cost. Voros McCracken's pathbreaking article on Defense Independent Pitching Statistics also first appeared on the BP website. Notable contributors Contributors to Baseball Prospectus include multiple notable sports figures, including: * Dave Cameron * Will Carroll * Clay Davenport * Rany Jazayerli * Christina Kahrl * Jonah Keri * Keith Law * Doug Pappas * John Perrotto * Dayn Perry * Joe Sheehan * Nate Silver * Keith Woolner Criticism =Criticism of methodology= Baseball Prospectus, as well as other sabermetric analysts, are criticized for taking the human aspect out of the game of baseball. For example, Murray Chass of The New York Times wrote in an article that he did not want to hear or read about new-age baseball statistics any more (referencing Value over replacement player specifically), saying: > \\"I suppose that if stats mongers want to sit at their computers and play > with these things all day long, that's their prerogative. But their attempt > to introduce these new-age statistics into the game threatens to undermine > most fans' enjoyment of baseball and the human factor therein. People play > baseball. Numbers don't.\\" Nate Silver, BP's Managing Partner at the time, responded to this criticism in \\"An Open Letter to Murray Chass,\\" including offering to meet Chass to watch a ballgame.Nate Silver, \\"An Open Letter to Murray Chass,\\"BaseballProspectus.com, February 27, 2007. Silver expounded on the case for a positive impact of sabermetrics on the game of baseball in an article \\"How Sabermetrics Helps Build a Better Ballgame,\\" published on Baseball Analysts.com.Nate Silver, \\"How Sabermetrics Helps Build a Better Ballgame\\", Baseball Analysts, May 10, 2007. Another type of criticism comes from those who believe that by broadening its coverage and audience, Baseball Prospectus is becoming more like the mainstream media and losing what made it unique. In response to a question along this line in an on-line chat, Silver wrote: > From a brand standpoint, we're more concerned about differentiation based on > quality than differentiation based on where we fall on sort of the > \\"saberpolitical\\" spectrum.Nate Silver, \\"Chat\\", BaseballProspectus.com, June > 27, 2007. =Criticism of journalistic standards= Baseball Prospectus was widely criticized for publishing and aggressively promoting a 2003 story claiming that banished player/manager Pete Rose had reached an agreement to return to baseball.Derek Zumsteg & Will Carroll,\\"The Return of Pete Rose: Exclusive ‚Äì He's Back in Baseball in 2004\\" , August 12, 2003. Will Carroll made the rounds on television and radio, claiming to have spoken to unnamed sources who had actually seen the agreement.King Kaufman, \\"Sports Daily\\" , August 12, 2003. Spokesmen for both Rose and Major League Baseball refuted the claim,ESPN.com, \\"Report called 'unfounded' and 'irresponsible'\\", August 12, 2003.\\"Baseball Denies Deal with Rose\\", August 14, 2003. but Carroll and his colleagues insisted their reporting was accurate. No other news source confirmed the story. In fact, Rose was not reinstated and remains banned from baseball.Baseball Hall of Fame website, \\"Why isn't Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame?\\" External links *Articles by BP writers in ESPN archive, 2003 *Articles by BP writers in ESPN Insider archive *Articles by BP writers in Sports Illustrated vault *Baseball Prospectus website *Baseball Daily Digest website *Basketball Prospectus website *Hockey Prospectus website *FootballOutsiders.com Notes Category:Baseball mass media Category:Baseball statistics Category:Baseball websites Category:Major League Baseball websites Category:American sport websites Category:Fantasy sports Category:Publications established in 1996 ","title":"Baseball Prospectus"},{"id":"2537351","text":"Faras (formerly , Pakh√¥ras; ; Old Nubian: ‚≤†‚≤Å‚≤≠‚≤±‚≤£‚≤Å‚≤•, Pakhoras) was a major city in Lower Nubia. The site of the city, on the border between modern Egypt and Sudan at Wadi Halfa Salient, was flooded by Lake Nasser in the 1960s and is now permanently underwater. Before this flooding, extensive archaeological work was conducted by a Polish archaeological team led by professor Kazimierz Micha≈Çowski. History C-Group people, 2300-1600 BCE, Faras. The Birth of Jesus - fresco in the Cathedral (Sudan National Museum in Khartoum) Fragment of the frieze with birds (National Museum in Warsaw) Stela, now in the National Museum of Sudan, with Setau, viceroy of Nubia, and his wife Nefro-mut worshipping Rameses II, whose Cartouche appears on the left side. Dating back to the A-Group period, the town was a major centre during the Meroitic period, and was the site of a major temple. During the period of ancient Egyptian control over Nubia, Faras became an Egyptian administrative centre and, located upriver from Abu Simbel, Egyptian cultural influences were prominent. The city reached its height during the Christian period of Nubia, when Faras was the capital of the basiliskos Silko of Nobadia. When Nobatia was absorbed into Makuria, it remained the most prominent center in the north, the seat of Nobadia's eparch. Archaeology In 1909‚Äì1912, research on the site was conducted by a British expedition from the University of Oxford headed by F.Ll. Griffith. Meroitic and Christian cemeteries, as well as Egyptian temples, were uncovered. At the turn of the 1960s, UNESCO organized the Nubian Salvage Campaign to preserve monuments from the area, which was to be flooded by Lake Nasser. Work in Faras, entrusted to Professor Kazimierz Micha≈Çowski, was carried out from 1960 to 1964 by the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw in Cairo, which he had founded (now Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw). It turned out that the hill where the mission began excavations concealed a Christian cathedral with magnificent wall paintings. The researchers distinguished three main phases of its functioning. The cathedral was founded by bishop Aetios in 620 and then twice rebuilt: by Paulos at the beginning of the 8th century and Petros I at the end of the 10th century. The subsequent buildings were called after these bishops. The cathedral had been completely filled with sand thanks to which its structure and decoration were well preserved. These paintings are the best surviving examples of Christian Nubian art and depict portraits of archangels, mainly Michael, various monarchs and bishops of Faras, Christian saints, Virgin Mary and a number of Biblical scenes. They were executed in tempera on dry plaster, on several layers dated from the 8th to the 14th century. Of the 169 uncovered paintings, 120 were taken down from the walls. Sixty-six of them were transported to Poland and are today on display in the Polish National Museum in Warsaw, and in Sudan National Museum in Khartoum. In addition, a major pottery workshop was found. Thanks to the discovery of the List of Bishops of Faras, it was possible to date each episcopate and thus to establish the date of some of the wall paintings. In the turbulent later years of Christian Nubia, Faras seems to have declined and the administrative centre moved to the more easily defended area of Qasr Ibrim.

His personal wealth was largely acquired during the late 1980s and early 1990s, which included the period in which he had a significant role in the structural adjustment of the New Zealand economy undertaken by New Zealand's Fourth Labour Government. He is thought to be worth in excess of NZD 920 million, making him the 10th richest New Zealand citizen in 2017. Early life and family Fay was born in Auckland on 10 April 1949. He was educated at St Peter's College, Auckland and St Patrick's College, Silverstream, and studied law at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating LLB in 1971. In 1983, he married Sarah Ann Williams, and the couple went on to have three children. Fay Richwhite Michael Fay and David Richwhite are best known for gaining wealth in a series of loosely regulated privatisation and asset swapping transactions that occurred between 1986 and 1993 - involving their companies European Pacific, Capital Markets and Fay Richwhite and the former state owned operations Bank of New Zealand, Tranz Rail and Telecom New Zealand, and the pension accounts associated to them. One notable transaction among these actions was their role as advisors to the government on the sale of New Zealand Rail Limited to overseas interests; a deal in which Fay and Richwhite later bought 31.8 per cent of the shares, and were subsequently investigated for insider trading by New Zealand authorities. =Securities Commission case= In October 2004 the New Zealand Securities Commission accused Richwhite and Midavia Rail Investments, a company owned by Richwhite and Fay, of insider trading. Richwhite was alleged to have tipped off Midavia to sell $63 million worth of Tranz Rail shares, whilst knowing Tranz Rail faced financial problems undisclosed to the public. In June 2007, Midavia paid $20 millionMidavia, Richwhite insider trading case settled to settle insider trading proceedings relating to Tranz Rail. The commission stated that the payments had been made \\"without any admission of liability\\". The settlement is the largest of its kind ever seen in Australasia. America's Cup Fay backed New Zealand's first America's Cup campaign in 1987, which won through to the challenger's final before losing to a US entry from San Diego. In 1988 Fay backed a challenge to the San Diego Yacht Club, who had just won the America's Cup. Rather than wait three to four years and join a general international challenge as had been the custom for thirty-five years, he had his legal team review the original Deed of Gift. The Deed of Gift was the document drawn up by the owners of the 100 Guineas Cup, won by the yacht America, to offer the cup for international competition. The deed did not specify a time delay between challenges, nor were competitors limited to compete in a particular class of boat, nor did boats have to be the same size or class. Fay financed the creation of KZ 1, a large single-hull yacht which complied with the original Deed of Gift but was much larger and hence faster than the 12-metre class boats which had been used for America's Cup competition for many years. Dennis Conner, skipper of the American defender, responded by building the multihull Stars & Stripes (US-1). Court actions followed which decided that both boats complied with the original Deed of Gift. Fay sailed on the boat during the 1988 America's Cup. The Stars & Stripes catamaran easily won. The bad press generated by Fay's heavily litigious approach to yacht racing heralded an era of better management and agreement for future challenges. In the 1990 Queen's Birthday Honours, Fay was appointed as a Knight Bachelor, for services to merchant banking and yachting. Fay was inducted into the America's Cup Hall of Fame in 2002. Sport and Domicile Fay is also the chairman of and was the financial backer of the Samoa national rugby union team. Fay now resides in New Zealand and, with David Richwhite, owns Great Mercury Island. They have spent $750,000, matching the same amount contributed by the Department of Conservation, to make the island (which is open to the public) pest-free, in a programme beginning in 2014.Michael Fox, \\"Private Funding Sways Conservation Decisions\\", The Dominion Post, 9 June 2014, p. 2.

The program consists of two components -- the Interview Survey and the Diary Survey -- each with its own sample. The surveys collect data on expenditures, income, and consumer unit characteristics. In May 2020, the American Association for Public Opinion Research recognized the CE program with its 2020 Policy Impact Award, for joint work by the BLS -- including CE and the Division of Price and Index Number Research -- and the Census Bureau on the Supplemental Poverty thresholds and measure, and the essential contributions these data products have made to the understanding, discussion, and advancement of public policy related to the alleviation of poverty in the United States. Interview Survey For the Interview Survey, each consumer unit is interviewed once per quarter, for four consecutive quarters. This survey is designed to capture large purchases, such as spending on rent, property, vehicles and expenses that occur on a regular basis such as rent or utilities. Since April 2003, data have been collected using a Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI). Prior to that, interviews were administered using paper and pencil. An example of the most recent CAPI instrument is available on the Consumer Expenditure Survey website. Diary Survey The Diary Survey is self-administered, and each consumer unit keeps a diary for two one-week periods. This survey is meant to capture small, frequently purchased items and allows respondents to record all purchases such as spending for food and beverages, tobacco, personal care products, and nonprescription drugs and supplies. The most recent Diary Survey form is available on the Consumer Expenditure Survey website. Consumer Unit A consumer unit consists of any of the following: (1) All members of a particular household who are related by blood, marriage, adoption, or other legal arrangements; (2) a person living alone or sharing a household with others or living as a roomer in a private home or lodging house or in permanent living quarters in a hotel or motel, but who is financially independent; or (3) two or more persons living together who use their incomes to make joint expenditure decisions. Financial independence is determined by spending behavior with regard to the three major expense categories: Housing, food, and other living expenses. To be considered financially independent, the respondent must provide at least two of the three major expenditure categories, either entirely or in part. The terms consumer unit, family, and household are often used interchangeably for convenience. However, the proper technical term for purposes of the Consumer Expenditure Survey is consumer unit.  Integrated Results  Data from the Interview Survey and the Diary Survey are combined to provide a complete account of expenditures and income. In some cases data are unique to a particular survey. For example, the Diary Survey provides greater detail of food expenditures than the Interview Survey, and the Interview Survey collects data on automobile repairs which are not found in the Diary Survey. For items collected in both surveys the BLS selects which data to use by statistical methods.  Survey Sample  The Consumer Expenditure Survey is designed to be representative of the entire U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population, and includes both urban and rural areas. The primary sampling frame is the Census Bureau‚Äôs Master Address File (MAF). That file has all residential addresses identified in the 2010 census and is updated twice per year with the U.S. Postal Service‚Äôs Delivery Sequence File. The data are collected for the BLS by the United States Census Bureau. Approximately 7,000 usable interviews are collected from the Interview Survey each quarter and approximately 14,000 usable diaries are collected for the Diary Survey per year. In 2013, the response rate was 65 percent for the Diary Survey and 65 percent for the Interview Survey.  Confidentiality  Personal information such as names, addresses, and phone numbers are never published. Data collected from the survey are protected by Title 13 of the United States Code. Each person with access to confidential information, including US Census Bureau field representatives and BLS employees, are sworn for life to protect this information. Violations of the law are a felony punishable by a prison sentence of up to five years and a fine of up to $250,000.  Data  = Recent Data = According to a BLS news release on September 9, 2020, average annual expenditures for all consumer units in 2019 were $63,036, a 3.0-percent increase from 2018, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. During the same period, the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) rose 1.8 percent and average income before taxes increased 5.4 percent. Accompanying 2019 annual data tables were also posted on the CE website on September 9, 2020. The next release of midyear data will be in April 2021. = Uses of Survey Data = These data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey are used in a number of different ways by a variety of users. One important use of the survey is for the periodic revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics‚Äô Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Bureau uses survey results to select new market baskets of goods and services for the CPI every two years, to determine the relative importance of CPI components, and to derive new cost weights for the market baskets. Working with the U.S. Census Bureau, Consumer Expenditure Survey data are used to calculate thresholds for the Supplemental Poverty Measure. The US Department of Agriculture uses Consumer Expenditure information in estimating the cost of raising children. Market researchers find the data useful in analyzing the demand for groups of goods and services. The data allow them to track spending trends of different types of consumer units. Government and private agencies use the data to study the welfare of particular segments of the population, such as those consumer units with a reference person aged 65 and older or under age 25, or for low-income consumer units. Economic policymakers use the data to study the impact of policy changes on the welfare of different socioeconomic groups. Researchers use the data in a variety of studies, including those that focus on the spending behavior of different family types, trends in expenditures on various expenditure components including new types of goods and services, gift-giving behavior, consumption studies, and historical spending trends. = Limitations = Both the Diary and Interview Surveys utilize a representative sample to measure the buying habits of American consumers. Only a small percentage of the U.S. population is surveyed, and therefore the data are subject to sampling errors. The division publishes standard error tables on their website. Non-sampling errors include, but are not limited to, respondents who are either unwilling or unable to provide accurate answers, mistakes made in collecting or recording obtained data, and estimation of missing data. = Microdata = Detailed annual data -- 1980 through 2019 -- for individual household/consumer units in both the Diary and Interview surveys are available for free download at the BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey website. The data are protected for confidentiality. The Consumer Expenditure Surveys Division also hosts a free research symposium and summer microdata users' workshop at BLS headquarters in Washington, DC. The 2021 symposium followed by the workshop will be held July 20 through 23, 2021.  History  The Consumer Expenditure Survey was first collected 131 years ago in 1888. It became a continuous survey in 1980. From the late 1800s until 1980 the survey had been administered at approximately ten-year intervals. More information about the 131 year history of the Consumer Expenditure Survey is available on the program's history page.

It consists of a series of caves which were used to bury the dead, and which were surrounded by a walled enclosure. It mainly dates back to around 3000 to 2400 BC, although the earliest tombs at the site date back to 4100 to 3800 BC. The caves collapsed sometime before 2000 BC, and the site was later used for domestic and agricultural purposes. After being discovered in the late 18th century, the site was excavated in the 1820s before being reburied and forgotten. It was rediscovered in 1964, and major excavations took place between 1987 and 1994. It is the only prehistoric stone-enclosed hypogeum in Europe, and it is regarded as one of the most important archaeological sites in Malta along with the megalithic temples and the Hypogeum of ƒ¶al-Saflieni. Recent dating through AMS has added scores of new date estimates of the burials as part of the ERC funded FRAGSUS project and the ToTL project. The isotopic studies indicate changing dietary and climatic conditions and link with broader changes in the local environment. Etymology When first discovered in 1788, the site was simply described as an \\"ancient structure\\" without a name. After it was depicted in paintings by Charles Frederick de Brocktorff in the 1820s, the site was commonly referred to as the Brochtorff Circle, although it is not known who came up with this name. The site eventually became known as the Xagƒßra Stone Circle or the Gozo Stone Circle. According to the archaeologist David Trump, these names are misnomers because 'Stone Circles' in northern Europe and the British Isles refer to a different type of Neolithic structure. In 2009, Trump coined the term Xagƒßra Circle as the name best describing the site. Site The Xagƒßra Stone Circle originally consisted of a walled enclosure surrounding caves which were used as a necropolis. It has some similarities to the Hypogeum of ƒ¶al-Saflieni, a prehistoric funerary complex on the main island of Malta. However, ƒ¶al- Saflieni is a man-made carved structure, while the Xagƒßra Stone Circle consists of natural caves which were adapted into a cemetery. Excavations at the site have shown that the bodies of the deceased were dismembered, and the different body parts were buried at separate places. The site was the burial ground of the same community which built the nearby ƒ†gantija temple, which is now well-preserved. Several other temples might have stood in the vicinity, including at Santa Verna (where a few megaliths which are probably the remains of an important temple were found) and Ta' ƒ†es√π. The earliest tombs at the site date back to between 4100 and 3800 BC, during the ≈ªebbuƒ° phase of Maltese prehistory. There is very little activity from 3800 to 3000 BC, and most of the site is believed to date back to 3000 to 2400 BC, during the Tarxien phase. The caves in which the complex was built were prone to collapse, and they weakened over time so megaliths were used in an attempt to stabilize the roof. The structure finally collapsed at some point before 2000 BC. During the Bronze Age, the site was probably used for non-funerary domestic purposes, and remains from the Tarxien Cemetery and Borƒ° in-Nadur phases were uncovered in the area. The land was subsequently used for agricultural purposes until the 20th century. Discovery, excavations and recent history Painting of the Xagƒßra Stone Circle by Charles Frederick de Brocktorff The Xagƒßra Stone Circle was first recorded by Jean Houel in 1788. In the 1820s, Otto Bayer excavated part of the complex through a collapsed cave roof, and Charles Frederick de Brocktorff painted several paintings showing the site during this excavation. The site was filled in by the late 1830s, and its exact location was lost over time. The two monumental pillars which formed the circle's entrance still stood in 1828, but they were subsequently removed. The complex was rediscovered by the Gozitan researcher Joe Attard Tabone in 1964. It was excavated between 1987 and 1994 by a joint team from the University of Malta, the Maltese Museums Department and the University of Cambridge. These excavations revealed the remains of one of the largest funerary complexes in the Mediterranean, and led to a better understanding of the society who built Malta's megalithic temples. About 220,000 human bones belonging to between 450 and 800 individuals were uncovered during the excavations, along with some animal bones and a series of artifacts, including figurines and architectural fragments. Stone figurines found at the Xagƒßra Stone Circle, now displayed at the ƒ†gantija museum The Xagƒßra Stone Circle is regarded as one of the most important archaeological sites in Malta. It is the only stone-enclosed hypogeum in Europe, and the only prehistoric necropolis in Malta which was properly excavated ‚Äì no records were kept when the human remains and artifacts at ƒ¶al-Saflieni were cleared in the early 20th century. Parts of the site remain unstudied, and efforts are being made to preserve the complex, since it is fragile and prone to collapse. The site is on government-owned land, and it is managed by Heritage Malta. The remains have Class A protection, and they are listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. The site is not accessible to the public.

The station is on a private dirt road between Loch More and Forsinain, which is marked as a cycle trail on Ordnance Survey maps. The station is situated on the Far North Line, down the line from and approximately from .British Rail Passenger Timetable, summer 1992, p1342 It has a single platform which is long enough to accommodate a four-carriage train. Being about away from the nearest paved road and away from the nearest village, Altnabreac is often listed as one of Britain's most geographically isolated railway stations, alongside elsewhere in Scotland and in Norfolk. The nearest village is Westerdale, which itself is in fact closer to Scotscalder station. Nevertheless, despite its isolation, the station is used by walkers and off-road cyclists, as well as railway enthusiasts and those who enjoy visiting remote locations. In the 201819 financial year the station saw 408 passengers, making it the 28th least-used station in the United Kingdom, although four other stations on the Far North Line had even fewer passengers, including neighbouring Scotscalder.Office of Rail Regulation: Station Usage The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail, which also operates all trains serving the station. History The station was opened by the Sutherland and Caithness Railway on 28 July 1874 and later absorbed by the Highland Railway. The reason for the station's construction is a mystery. At the time of construction it was from the nearest settlement and from the nearest road. The only source of traffic at the station, Lochdhu Lodge, approximately to the south, was not built until 1895 and the Altnabreac School was not built until 1930. However, it had a passing loop with a water tank so may have been established for purely operational reasons. Taken into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923, the line then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced by British Rail, the station became part of ScotRail until the Privatisation of British Rail.  Services  Train approaching the station. On weekdays and Saturdays, the service pattern from the station consists of four trains per day northbound to via and three trains per day southbound to via , , , and . (There is a fourth train bound for Inverness but it is not scheduled to call at Altnabreac.) On Sundays there is just one train per day each way. This station is designated as a request stop. This means that passengers intending to alight must inform the guard in advance, and any passengers wishing to board must ensure they are in view of the train driver, and are required to use a hand signal to stop the train.

U.S. Public Records Index, 1950-1993, Volume 1 [database on-line]. Provo, UT: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010. Retrieved April 7, 2016. was an American forensic chemist who had participated in more than 3,000 criminal cases in 21 years while working for the Oklahoma City Police Department, and who was accused of falsifying evidence to help prosecutors. Her evidence led in part to 23 people being sentenced to death, 12 of whom have been executed. After her dismissal, Gilchrist alleged that she was fired in retaliation for reporting sexual misconduct. Biography Gilchrist earned the nickname \\"Black Magic\\" for her ability to match DNA evidence that other forensic examiners could not. She was also known for being unusually adept at testifying and persuading juries, thus obtaining convictions. In 1994, Gilchrist was promoted to supervisor from forensic chemist after just nine years on the job, but her colleagues began to raise concerns about her work. Concerns about Gilchrist's actions were first raised when a landscaper, Jeffrey Todd Pierce, who had been convicted of rape in 1986 largely based on Gilchrist's evidence despite a clean criminal record and good alibi, was exonerated based on additional DNA evidence. Pierce, a husband and the father of two infant children, was misidentified in a police line-up. After voluntarily giving hair and blood samples to the police investigators in an attempt to clear his name, he was arrested and charged with the rape. Gilchrist claimed his hair samples were \\"microscopically consistent\\" with the hairs found at the crime scene. Pierce was cleared of the crime in 2001 after DNA evidence was re-examined, and released after 15 years in prison. Pierce subsequently filed a lawsuit against Oklahoma City, seeking $75 million and charging that Gilchrist and Bob Macy, a now-retired district attorney, conspired to produce false evidence against him. The suit was settled for $4 million in 2007, with one Oklahoma City councilman noting that the city could have had to pay much more. Dismissal Gilchrist was dismissed in September 2001 due to \\"flawed casework analysis\\" and \\"laboratory mismanagement\\". She consistently denied any wrongdoing and was never charged with any crime. Aftermath Other cases from individuals convicted on Gilchrist's testimony continue to work their way through the courts. *Michael Blair was sentenced to die for the murder of a young girl in 1993. The evidence leading to his conviction included shafts of hair found near the girl's body and in Blair's car. New DNA evidence showed that the hair matched neither the girl, nor Blair. *During the early 1990s, Oklahoma state law did not allow defense attorneys to use government funds to hire other forensic scientists to verify Gilchrist's claims. However, during appeals of Malcolm Rent Johnson's death penalty case, two forensic experts hired by the defense were critical of Gilchrist's testimony, particularly as it relied upon several \\"blue-colored hairs\\" that seemed too \\"ubiquitous\\" to be useful evidence. *Curtis McCarty was released in 2007 after spending nearly 20 years on death row. The courts found that Gilchrist acted to either alter or intentionally lose evidence. McCarty sued Gilchrist for her wrongdoing, but his case was thrown out on technical terms, like those of most exonerees. *In June 2018, Johnny Edward Tallbear was released after 26 years in jail for a murder he did not commit. Gilchrist testified under oath that Tallbear's blood matched that found at the scene of the crime. DNA testing showed this to be incorrect. Over 1,700 cases in which Gilchrist's evidence was significant to conviction were reviewed by the State of Oklahoma. Gilchrist‚Äôs attorney stated that, \\"The criticism of [Joyce Gilchrist] around here is second only to that of Timothy McVeigh.\\" After her dismissal, Gilchrist filed a lawsuit seeking $20.1 million, claiming that her firing was actually motivated by revenge, after she reported sexual misconduct by her supervisor. The 12th-season Law & Order episode \\"Myth of Fingerprints\\" was inspired by Gilchrist's case. Death After her dismissal, Gilchrist relocated to Houston, where she worked for a candle-making company. She died in Texas on June 14, 2015.

Better dickeys have a trouser tab at the end to secure them down, preventing the dickey from popping out. The rigid plastic dickey came into fashion in the latter years of the 19th century, and was one of the first successful commercial applications of celluloid. The invention of the dickey was to make the bosom front of a full dress shirt a separate entity in itself, like the detachable collar, so it could be laundered and starched more easily than a traditional shirt with the bosom attached. The use of the dickey was considered bad style by traditionalists and had fallen out of use. Shirts with an attached bosom are now rare in themselves since traditional evening dress is no longer regularly worn. The etymology can be attributed to Cockney rhyming slang where a \\"dicky dirt\\" is a shirt. Additionally, British office workers were required to wear suits, but their wages made it difficult to keep a fresh supply of laundered shirts. It was common practice, especially by the 1850s, to use dickeys as a way of covering dirty shirts.  Dickeys ‚Äì celluloid, cardboard, and cloth  = Celluloid (hard plastic) = Celluloid dickeys were popular for their waterproof and stain-resistant properties. Unlike traditional cloth shirt- fronts, they remained sleek, bright white, and did not wilt or wrinkle. Celluloid dickeys simulated the look of a formal shirt bib for day and evening wear. They were designed in a variety of patents, such as: rounded, flat-end, no restraints, a restraint tab at the end of the bib or side straps that tied at the wearer's back. For this reason, they were popular with entertainers, musicians, and other performers. Nevertheless, they were frequently maligned and spoofed for their stiffness, unmanageability, and tendency to pop out of place. In one notable Looney Tunes segment, Bugs Bunny conducts an arrogant opera singer and makes him hold a note so long that his dickey snaps out of his waistcoat and rolls up to his throat. \\"The flapping dickey\\", a famous Vaudeville clich√©, involves a dickey which has been intentionally rigged to flap in a comical fashion. = Cardboard = Cardboard dickeys were worn in theater and service professions to save money from using linen formal shirts for uniforms. Examples of professions that used cardboard dickeys include waiters, hotel managers, doormen, bellboys, limo drivers, and servants. Cardboard dickeys are still manufactured in the United States by Amazon Drygoods. = Cloth = Cloth dickeys simulate many different styles, some often seen examples include dress shirt front and collar, formal frilled shirt front (popular in the mid seventies with powder blue tuxedos) and most commonly in modern times as false turtleneck sweater fronts. Cloth dickeys are also often used in marching band uniforms. Hard plastic dickeys have long since gone out of manufacture and fashion, but cloth turtleneck-style dickeys are still sometimes seen.  Dickeys in women‚Äôs wear  The dickey, traditionally worn by men, made the transition to women's wear around 1943. While women may have worn dickeys before this time, ads in Vogue New York can be seen promoting dickeys in the February 1943 issue. Dickeys were said to ‚Äúenliven your new suit or rejuvenate your old‚Äù. Women's dickeys were made from cotton or rayon and embellished with embroidery, lace, jabots, and ruffles. They were priced between $2-$3 at the time. Patterns for women's dickeys can also be found dating to 1944, with Butterick's patterns providing eight variations on the dickey.Butterick.

In an interview with InStyle Magazine, Kors said the dickey was a way to add versatility to a look, without adding bulk. The rise of the dickey in pop culture has also encouraged the rise in popularity. For example, on the TV series The Big Bang Theory, worn by the character Howard Wolowitz, as well as in Dinner for Schmucks, where the character Therman Murch (played by Zach Galifianakis) wore an orange turtleneck dickey. Cousin Eddie (played by Randy Quaid) in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation wore a dark green turtleneck dickey underneath an ivory sweater. The character Liz Lemon wore a \\"sweater\\" type dickey on the opening episode of season 6 on the TV series 30 Rock.. The character Kent was wearing a dickey in the end scenes of the movie Real Genius.  Cultural dress  The dickey is not just a facet of men's wear clothing, it is also used in certain types of cultural dress. = Armenia = Historically, Armenian dress consisted of layers, a result of the variability of the weather, with short and hot summers and long and cold winters. Layers could be switched out easily when changes in the weather occurred. One component of this layering was a dicky style shirt that was heavily embroidered to cover the chest if the woman's outer dress was low cut. = Greece = It is traditional for Greek widows to wear black to signify their mourning. Historically, widows in certain regions of Greece, specifically Peloponnese and Euboea, \\"wore a plain white chemise and an unembroidered sigouni with a black dickey, black headscarf and black apron.\\" = S√°mi People (Northern Europe, Western Russia) = Both men and women of the S√°mi culture, particularly in the central and southern parts of the S√°mi region, wear dickeys under certain tunic styles. The tunics often have a V-neck opening that the dicky is worn under. The dickeys are usually rectangular and are made from wool. Traditionally, women wear red wool while men wear blue. The dickey is usually decorated with reindeer skin around the edges and metallic thread and glass beads in the center. The purpose is for the dickey to be the focal point of the outfit.

He founded the Philadelphia Aurora, a newspaper that supported Jeffersonian philosophy. He frequently attacked the Federalist political leaders, including Presidents George Washington and John Adams, and historian Gordon S. Wood wrote that \\"no editor did more to politicize the press in the 1790s.\\"Wood (2009), p. 253 His paper's heated attacks are thought to have contributed to passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts by the 5th United States Congress and signed by President John Adams in 1798. The grandson of Benjamin Franklin, Bache was often referred to as \\"Lightning Rod Junior\\" after his famous grandfather's experiment. The son of Sarah Franklin and Richard Bache, he died at 29 in the yellow fever epidemic of 1798. Early life Sarah \\"Sally\\" Franklin, the only daughter of Benjamin Franklin and Deborah Read, met Richard Bache while on a visit away from her parents. They were married on November 2, 1767. On August 12, 1769, she gave birth to their son, Benjamin Franklin Bache.Fay, Bernard.The Two Franklins. Little, Brown, and Company, 1933, p. 3. From the moment she set eyes on her grandson, Deborah Read Franklin fell in love with Benjamin, whom she called ‚Äúher little kingbird.‚Äù She took to ‚ÄúBenny,‚Äù as she called him, as her very own. She and her husband had lost their only son, Francis Folger Franklin, at the age of four from smallpox. She and Benjamin had earlier taken in his illegitimate son, William Franklin, as an infant at the beginning of their marriage, and raised him in their household. Benjamin Franklin Bache was baptized on August 30, 1769, in Christ Church in Philadelphia. His godmothers were his paternal aunt and Deborah Read Franklin. His godfathers were his uncle and grandfather Benjamin Franklin, who had a proxy at the ceremony, as he was on an extended diplomatic mission in England.Fay (1933).The Two Franklins, p. 9. On December 19, 1774, Deborah Read died.Fay (1933).The Two Franklins, p. 10. Although he was at her funeral, the boy Benjamin regretted not having been at his grandmother's deathbed. In May 1775, at the age of five, Bache met his grandfather Benjamin Franklin for the first time when he returned from England.Fay (1933), The Two Franklins, p. 14. His grandfather's arrival brought more tumult to his home, as Franklin had brought with him William Temple Franklin, his 15-year-old grandson, who was the illegitimate son of William Franklin. On October 29, 1776, Franklin took his two grandsons along on his diplomatic mission to France to negotiate a firm alliance. Bache was seven when their party boarded the USS Reprisal, and sailed for France. They suffered violent storms, and attacks by hostile British ships. Soon after arriving in France, Benjamin Franklin enrolled Bache in a local boarding school run by Mr. d‚ÄôHourville. Without any English speaking students attending the school, Franklin later transferred him to Le Coeur's along with other students from the British North American colonies, such as Charles Cochran, Jesse Deane, and John Quincy Adams, son of John Adams of Massachusetts.Tagg, James. Benjamin Franklin Bache and the Philadelphia Aurora. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1991, p. 28. In the spring of 1779, Benjamin Franklin sent Bache to Geneva, as he wanted Bache to gain experience in a Republic. By June 1783, Benjamin Franklin was ready to recall his grandson to Paris, where he would study how to be a printer until they left Europe to return to Philadelphia in 1785. Bache was a good student at the University of Pennsylvania, having graduated in 1787; later at a school in Geneva, Switzerland, he won the school prize for translating Latin into French. Perhaps affected by being taken from his family at such a young age, as well as his grandfather's lengthy absences due to his diplomatic work, Bache appeared depressed and shy as an adolescent. Printing career Three pence Bank of North America note printed (1789) by Bache on specialized marbled paper obtained by Benjamin Franklin After a few years at Le Coeur's, Franklin began having Bache trained for a career as a printer-publisher, as he had been. In the early months at Geneva, the youth was under the care of Philibert Cramer.Tagg (1991), James. Benjamin Franklin Bache and the Philadelphia Aurora, p. 30. At the age of 13, he was also learning the classics: he was already interpreting Telemachus, Terence, Sallust, Cicero's Catiline Orations, Lucian, and the New Testament in Greek. In 1781, Bache wrote in his diary about the extensive school work which demanded much of his time.Tagg (1991), Benjamin Franklin Bache and the Philadelphia Aurora, p. 31. Upon returning to Philadelphia, Bache began working as a printer at his grandfather's shop at the family's Franklin Court property on Market Street, presaging his future career as a newspaper editor. Bache had learned type-founding as an apprentice in Paris to Francois-Ambrose Didot, the first printer to print on vellum paper. He considered Didot to be the ‚Äúbest printer that now exists and maybe that has ever existed.‚ÄùSmith, Jeffery A. Franklin and Bache. Oxford University Press, 1990, p. 88. After living abroad for so long, he felt that Philadelphia seemed foreign.Fay (1933),The Two Franklins, p. 86. As his grandfather was starting to fade, Bache oversaw the print shop's operations, but under the older man's watchful eye. His first print job was \\"An Ode in Imitation of Alcaeus,\\" a poem by the linguistic scholar William Jones, who decried England's corruption and the misuse of monarchical power. Bache's first ventures in commercial publishing were school texts, including Isaiah Thomas‚Äô collection of writings by Aesop and Erasmus. His early ventures also included reprinting a series of four Lessons for Children books by Anna Letitia Barbauld, an Englishwoman. She used a Lockean approach of applying behavioral techniques of esteem and disgrace to instill wisdom and virtue. Her works taught children not to cry, mistreat animals, or be idle. In one story, three boys at a boarding school receive cakes from home. Harry greedily eats his cake and becomes sick. Peter hoards his cake until it becomes stale. Billy shares his cake with the other students and eventually with an old blind man. The act of being unselfish made the boy ‚Äúmore glad than if he had eaten ten cakes.‚ÄùSmith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 100. Newspaper career Following his grandfather's death in 1790, Bache inherited Franklin's printing equipment and many of his books. He founded The Philadelphia Aurora, a newspaper with an editorial position that surpassed Franklin's fierce pro- French and democratic position. Bache promised, \\"This paper will always be open, for the discussion of political, or any other interesting subjects, to such as deliver their sentiments with temper and decency, and whose motives appears to be, the public good.\\"Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 102. He also said, \\"The strictest impartiality will be observed in the publication of pieces offered with this view.\\"Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 104. When he started on October 1, 1790, he called the paper the General Advertiser, and Political, Commercial, Agricultural and Literary Journal. In contrast to other papers, his incorporated articles on the sciences, literature, and the useful arts. Like Bache, many republican opponents criticized the Federalist policies and practices for ignoring the premises of enlightenment egalitarianism.Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 119. After three months, on January 1, 1791, Bache dropped the word ‚ÄúAgricultural‚Äù from his paper's title and removed the motto ‚Äì ‚ÄúTruth, Decency, Utility‚Äù ‚Äì from the nameplate. He enlarged the size of the paper's pages. Bache told his readers that he could not offer the variety of material originally intended as long as a ‚Äúmore important matter‚Äù was at hand. Later that year, Bache also dropped the words ‚ÄúPolitical, Commercial and Liberty Journal‚Äù from the nameplate. Increasingly polemical, the paper promoted political reforms in line with republican ideals.Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 112. Bache continued to denounce the Federalists and attacked both the current President, John Adams, and George Washington. He provoked outrage by suggesting that Washington had secretly collaborated with the British during the American Revolution. After passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798, legislation supported by President Adams, Bache was arrested. The law may have been written to suppress opponents such as Bache. The persistent theme of Republican journalism of the 1790s was that the federal government had fallen into the hands of an aristocratic party aligned with Britain, and that the Federalists (particularly Washington and Alexander Hamilton) were hostile to the interests of the general public while promoting corporate interests.Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 127. Bache thought the problem was less the form of governance than the beliefs and behavior of those who governed.Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 126. Bache objected to the US Senate's holding its meetings behind closed doors, as he thought that showed contempt for the public. He thought discussion about the Jay Treaty, for instance, should have been open to the public. In November 1794, Bache said that he was renaming his paper to The Aurora and General Advertiser; it was to ‚Äúdiffuse light within the sphere of its influence, dispel the shades of ignorance, and gloom of error and thus tend to strengthen the fair fabric of freedom on its surest foundation, publicity and information.‚Äù The name, ‚ÄúAurora‚Äù represented the ascent and accessibility of information promised to its readers. Bache adopted the motto \\"Surgo Ut Prosim\\" (I rise to be useful), to honor his grandfather. For Bache, the motto symbolized the dawning, not the setting of the sun on the new republic.Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 137. =Decline= The Aurora was regularly filled with articles attacking what Bache considered to be Washington's monarchical tendencies, his hostile actions toward France, contempt for the public, and his friendly relations with Britain.Fay (1933), The Two Franklins, p. 269. After anti-Federalists accused Washington of being too ready to accept public adulation, Bache increased his attacks.Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 145. The publisher appeared to lose impartiality as he increasingly favored Jefferson and became more hostile to Adams. Bache had not been equally critical of Washington's presidency. Washington had been a frequent visitor at the Franklin family's home. While still a general, Washington enjoyed a close relationship with Bache's grandfather.Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 141. Bache's attacks on the administrations of Washington and Adams provoked equal hostility from their supporters.Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 158. Bache suffered financially for his position, as Jeffersonians turned elsewhere. At one point, he could not pay a five-dollar fine, and increasingly was unable to pay his own employees in a timely manner. Many Federalists withdrew business from him. While he acquired several hundred new subscribers in 1798, he encountered problems in collecting payment. The newspaper's viability declined.Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 159. Increasingly, Bache was attacked by other journalists in print. William Cobbett, known by his nom de plume Peter Porcupine, wrote malicious descriptions of Bache, and mocked his late grandfather. Even Federalists thought Cobbett had gone too far. Bache paid little attention to the hostile chatter, but his friends became concerned for his safety. =Downfall= In April 1797, while Bache was investigating the construction of the ship , Clement Humphreys, the son of the ship's architect, physically assaulted him. Bache escaped, but heard remarks from the crowd that he deserved the beating. He had printed an accusation that the ship's carpenters were taking bribes. In May 1798, Bache's residence and office were threatened by a mob. They smashed the glass door leading to his office, but refrained from vandalizing his home. His family was terrified.Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 160. Soon after, Bache criticized John Fenno in print. His son John Ward Fenno confronted Bache, demanding that he publicly apologize to his father; when the publisher refused, Fenno assaulted him. Bache fought back and generally refused to be intimidated by such threats. While the Federalist-dominated Congress passed the Sedition Act of 1798 to suppress criticism such as Bache's, Bache was arrested in June 1798 for common-law seditious libel even before the law was passed.The Adamant Patriot: Benjamin Franklin Bache as Leader of the Opposition Press, Raffi Andonian He quickly posted bail and continued to publish his paper, condemning the Act in print as a violation of the First Amendment.Smith (1990), Franklin and Bache, p. 161. =Death and legacy= Before being tried, Bache died on September 8, 1798, at the age of 29 from yellow fever during an epidemic; while Philadelphia's worst yellow fever epidemic was in 1793, the disease regularly visited the city. Bache was buried in the Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia. He is regarded as an early champion of freedom of speech and the First Amendment.

The Capital/Concord lineup underwent a series of facelifts, eventually becoming the \\"New Capital\\" and \\"New Concord\\" in marketing material. Production of the Concord ended in 1995, while the cheaper Capital continued until late 1996. In 1996, Kia replaced the car with the Kia Credos, which they based on the Mazda GE Platform. History Kia Concord. 1991-1995 Kia New Concord 1.8i GTX 1989 Kia Concord 2.0i DGT rear 1991-1995 Kia New Concord 1.8i GTX rear First introduced in April 1987, the Concord received the carburetted 2-litre petrol FE engine. During 1988, the engine programme was expanded considerably, with the 2-litre diesel \\"RF\\" added in April, a 1.8-litre (F8) in May, a fuel-injected version (called the 2.0i DGT) added in July, and finally an LPG powered 1.8 for taxi usage added in August. This expansion allowed the Concord to better compete with the Hyundai Sonata. The DGT's name was a reference to the digital dashboard with which it was fitted. After the 1991 facelift the engine programme was somewhat restricted, but in March 1992 a comparatively powerful DOHC version of the 2.0 was added, with at 6000 rpm. With the 1995 introduction of the Kia Credos, production of the Concord came to an end. The smaller and simpler Capital continued a little while longer as a low-priced alternative. Kia Capital Pre-facelift Kia Capital DOHC 16V Kia \\"New Capital\\" LS Di Pre-facelift Kia Capital DOHC 16V Kia \\"New Capital\\" LS Di The lower end Capital (K930-series) was added in February 1989 with a carburetted two-valve SOHC version of the Mazda 1.5-litre B5 engine. Power was at 6000 rpm. There was also a 1.5 MPFi version with a claimed , the same output as that of the fuel-injected 1.8-litre GLX version available until the facelift. After a change in legislation meaning that cars were now taxed based on displacement, with a major threshold at 1.5 litres, the Capital was available with a Twin Cam, 16-valve B5 engine in May 1990. This surprising development had on tap at 6,500 rpm. Top speed was , the same as for the fuel-injected 1.5, but 0‚Äì100 km/h acceleration time dropped from 13.5 to 10.0 seconds. After the 1990 introductions of stronger competitors such as the Daewoo Espero and Hyundai Elantra, the Capital received a facelift in November 1991. The facelift was not very deep, the most obvious difference being the relocation of the rear license plate to the bumper rather than between the taillights. The facelift version offered the 1.5 engine as well as a downgraded version of the 1.8, now to carburetted specifications and producing a mere at 5000 rpm. This was mainly intended for taxi usage. There was also an export version with the carburetted two-valve 1.5 for Kia's very few export markets, with . In June 1994 the Capital received another facelift, featuring more rounded headlights and a new grille with new Kia logo, replacing the old one with chimney-based design. This was called the \\"New Capital\\" in the marketing, although the badging on the car remained plain \\"Capital\\". The New Capital was only sold with the 16-valve B5 engine, in GS or higher LS equipment levels. Production of the Capital finally ended in December 1996, overlapping a few years with the Sephia that would eventually replace it. Kia continued its line of mid-size sedans with Credos (1995), Optima (2000), Lotze (2005) and K5 (2010).

Plot Cookie Voltecki (Emily Lloyd) jumps the turnstiles with her friend and is caught by transit security who fine her and bring her to court. There she is defended from her charges by a lawyer she doesn't know and put in a car where she is taken to her estranged father, Dino Capisco (Peter Falk), who is about to finish a thirteen-year prison sentence. To straighten Cookie out he sends her to work with an old associate of his named Carmine (Michael V. Gazzo). Dino is successfully paroled and goes home with his wife Bunny, but shortly after goes to visit Cookie's mother Lenore Voltecki (Dianne Wiest), Dino's longtime mistress. Cookie is disgusted with the way the married Dino treats her mother and Dino grows frustrated with Cookie, but at Lenore's urging the two go to a Christmas party at Carmine's. While there Cookie and Dino fight and leave early. Aware that he is being followed by the feds, who want to put him back in prison, Dino has Cookie shake their security detail. When pictures of them end up in newspapers Dino tells his wife that Cookie is his driver and begins using her as such. Dino reveals to Cookie he is actually mad with Carmine, who sold out his shares in a business they had together when Dino was in prison and now refuses to give him the money from the sale. To get revenge Dino calls the union on Carmine's sweatshop and also has some of his men ransack trucks containing Carmine's merchandise. In retaliation some of Carmine's men shoot at Dino's car while Cookie is driving it and later plant a bomb in Dino's car, though no one is harmed. A worried Cookie reaches out to the FBI, offering to give up her father's associates as long as he is put in witness protection. Dino vetoes the idea since he thinks Carmine's men will never stop hunting him down, but Cookie suggests they fake his death so that Carmine won't bother looking for him. Dino and Cookie hatch a plot where they leak out that Dino has millions and is planning to retire to Italy. Carmine decides to steal the money and then kill Dino but the plan goes awry when the money is stolen. Carmine then goes to confront Dino and is blown up in his car. The district attorney is horrified that he accidentally killed Carmine but Cookie tells him he still needs to honor his agreement to put Dino in witness protection lest she divulge that he murdered someone. Dino and Lenore leave to go to witness protection and Cookie hugs her father and takes a picture of the three of them as a family. Cookie attends Dino's funeral while elsewhere Dino and Lenore marry and get ready to spend their lives together with their new identities.

It is located on a peninsula on the north shore of Jamaica Bay, bounded by Fresh Creek to the west and Hendrix Creek to the east. Starrett City contains both residential and commercial buildings. The residential portion of the property contains eight \\"sections\\" in a towers in the park layout. The complex also contains a community and recreation center, as well as two schools. Plans for developing the site of Starrett City date to 1962, when an investment group bought the property with the intention of developing a residential complex called Park Shore Village. The group ultimately withdrew from the project, and another cooperative housing project named Twin Pines Village was proposed by the United Housing Foundation in 1967. Control of the complex was handed to Starrett City Associates in 1971, and Starrett City opened in 1974. The complex assumed the name of Spring Creek Towers in 2002, though it is still popularly known as Starrett City. Starrett City is part of Brooklyn Community District 5, and its primary ZIP Code is 11239. It is patrolled by the 75th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council's 42nd District.Current City Council Districts for Kings County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. Description The Spring Creek Towers site (commonly known as Starrett City) is located on a peninsula on the north shore of Jamaica Bay, bounded by Fresh Creek to the west and Hendrix Creek to the east. The development is bound to the north by Flatlands Avenue and to the south by Seaview Avenue and the Shore Parkway section of the Belt Parkway system. Pennsylvania Avenue runs north-to-south through the complex, with Louisiana Avenue at the west end and Van Siclen Avenue at the east end. The development originally spanned before being subdivided in 2009 as part of a refinancing. It now occupies , after several parcels of undeveloped land were separated out from the residential site. The housing development contains 5,881 apartment units in 46 buildings, which range from 11 to 20 stories high. The development was designed by Herman Jessor, organized in the towers in the park layout. The buildings utilize a simple \\"foursquare\\" design. The residential portion of the property has eight \\"sections\\" each including several buildings, its own field, recreational area (jungle gym, park, handball court, basketball court) and a five-story parking garage for residents in that section. These sections are Ardsley, Bethel, Croton, Delmar, Elmira, Freeport, Geneva, and Hornell, which are each named after municipalities in New York State. The residential part of Starrett City also includes eight parking garages, a community center, and two public schools. The area contains a shopping center as well. Starrett City is said to be the largest federally assisted rental property in the United States. The treatment plant in Starrett City Starrett City has its own power plant, the Starrett City Cogeneration Facility, located at 165 Elmira Loop on the east side of Starrett City. The power plant opened in 1973 and provides electricity, heating, cooling, and hot water to all residents of Starrett City. It is self-sufficient enough that during the 1977 New York City blackout, the complex was able to provide its own power. There is also a sewage treatment plant next to the cogeneration facility, called the 26th Ward Wastewater Treatment Plant. The treatment plant, located on a plot, can filter up to per day from the sewage systems in Brownsville, Canarsie, and East New York. The treatment plant and cogeneration facility were formerly operationally separate. However, in 1982, the city government began giving the treatment plant's methane emissions and thousands of gallons of treated cold water to the cogeneration facility, in exchange for hot water from the cogen facility. At the southeast corner of the complex on Van Siclen Avenue is the complex's community and recreation center, which opened in 1978 and is located across the street from the treatment plant. It features a pool and tennis club, an auditorium, and other recreational facilities. It is now called the Brooklyn Sports Club. Starrett City also has its own boxing gym, Starrett City Boxing. It was also opened in 1978, inside the parking garage at Hornell Loop near the south end of the complex. It is home to many world champion boxers, including Zab Judah, Shannon Briggs, Dmitriy Salita, Luis Collazo, and Will Rosinsky. =Public safety= Starrett City is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 75th Precinct, though primary security is assumed by its own private security force, called the Spring Creek Towers Department of Public Safety. The Spring Creek Towers security force was created because, when Starrett City opened in the 1970s, the 75th Precinct had one of the highest crime rates in New York City. In the five years after Starrett City opened, it had one of the city's lowest crime rates, mainly because of the existence of the security force. The Spring Creek Towers Department of Public Safety has been used as a case study in the advantages of private security over public policing (however, Starrett City's officers are not security guards, but commissioned peace officers). Edwin Donovan and William Walsh write that \\"Statistically, Starrett City must be considered one of the safest communities in the United States.\\" The Spring Creek Towers Department of Public Safety employs public safety officers, armed while on duty, to preserve the life and property of the residents of the complex. Officers enforce New York state laws as well as New York City laws. Starrett City is patrolled by officers 24 hours a day on foot, bicycles, or in vehicles. =Ownership and management= The complex is owned by Starrett City Associates, which was originally headed by Disque Deane. U.S. President Donald Trump owns 4% of the complex, inherited from his father Fred Trump. Spring Creek Towers brought Trump revenue exceeding $5 million during the period between January 2016 and April 15, 2017.Boburg, Shawn via Washington Post. \\"Trump seeks sharp cuts to housing aid, except for program that brings him millions\\", Chicago Tribune, June 20, 2017.

Trump's 4 percent stake in the Brooklyn housing complex earned him at least $5 million between January of last year and April 15, according to his recent financial disclosure.\\" =Education= There are no high schools within Starrett City; the nearest high schools are the Academy for Young Writers and Spring Creek Community School (within the Spring Creek Educational Campus) just east on Flatlands Avenue, and the William H. Maxwell Vocational High School and Thomas Jefferson Educational Campus (formerly Thomas Jefferson High School) on Pennsylvania Avenue in the northern portions of East New York. Additionally, the Canarsie and South Shore Campuses (also formerly high schools) are located in the adjacent Canarsie neighborhood. There are four elementary and middle schools within Starrett City's boundaries: * Abe Stark Elementary School ( 346) * Gateway Intermediate School ( 364) * Frederick Douglass Academy VIII Middle School (located on the 4th floor of 346) * Be'er Hagolah, a Jewish elementary and high school The Brooklyn Public Library's Spring Creek Branch is located just outside Starrett City's northern boundary, at the northwest corner of Flatlands and New Jersey Avenues. The single-story, structure opened in 1977. = Transportation = When it opened, Starrett City was advertised as having convenient transportation links to the rest of the city via bus and subway. Starrett City is served by the local buses, the B82 Select Bus Service, and the express buses, all operated by MTA Regional Bus Operations. Additionally, the , B60 and B103 buses, also operated by the MTA, stop just north of the development. The nearest New York City Subway stations are at East 105th Street and Canarsie-Rockaway Parkway, both served by the . History Pennsylvania Avenue, Starrett City's major artery =Development= In 1962, a California-based investment group purchased of land along Pennsylvania Avenue between Flatlands Avenue and the Belt Parkway, intending to construct apartments on the property. The Thompson‚ÄìStarrett Co. was retained to construct the buildings. In March 1964, the investment group applied to the New York State Housing Finance Agency for a mortgage worth $145 million towards the development. At the time, the site was referred to as part of Canarsie. On December 1, 1964, the State Housing Finance Agency announced a project called Park Shore Village, which would construct a middle-income apartment complex on the site. The complex would consist of 19 buildings standing 11, 17 and 21 stories high. It would also include a shopping center, community center, swimming pools, and a skating rink, along with a new elementary school (PS 346) and parking for residents. Funds would be provided by loans under the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program. The development would be built in two phases, eventually housing 25,000 people. The project was approved by the New York City Planning Commission on January 20, 1965, and by the New York City Board of Estimate on February 11, 1965. Construction on the first phase was projected to start in the spring of that year and be complete by 1967, at which point the second phase would begin. However, the original investment group withdrew due to financial concerns and the project did not commence. On June 27, 1967, Governor Nelson Rockefeller announced modified version of the project called Twin Pines Village, which would construct a cooperative on the site in what was then part of Canarsie. The development would house 6,000 families. The project was now sponsored by the United Housing Foundation (UHF), who were also developing Co-op City. Twin Pines would consist of 43 buildings, rising 11, 15, or 21 stories. Like the Park Shore plan, the development would also contain a shopping complex, community center and schools, and would sit across a portion of present-day Spring Creek Park which was then being developed as the Fountain Avenue Landfill. It was proclaimed as the \\"largest co-op ever built in Brooklyn\\", and would be the second largest in the city behind Co-op City, with a size comparable to that of Rochdale Village. In December 1967, the state gave the UHF $15.8 million to start construction on the Twin Pines Village complex. The UHF abandoned the project in March 1971 after running out of money. At the time, construction had begun at the north end of the complex. Following the exit of the UHF, the project was sold to a new group of investors, including Disque Deane and Lazard Fr√®res along with around 200 other individuals. This group would become the Starrett City Associates. The complex was renamed Starrett City and would be developed as a joint venture by the Starrett Corporation and the National Kinney Corporation. In addition, the development was changed from a co-op to rental apartments in part to make the development more profitable. Construction resumed in mid-1972, and Pennsylvania Avenue was closed to accommodate construction. Workers started constructing towers at the south end of the site by the Belt Parkway, in an effort to attract potential tenants who were exiting from the Belt Parkway. This added one million dollars to the cost of construction, since utilities had been laid at the north end. The initial work included the filling of the swampland with sand from Jamaica Bay, and the construction of the power plant. In 1973, a contract was awarded to the Otis Elevator Company to install 100 elevators in the complex. That year, real estate developer Fred Trump acquired a 20 percent interest in the development. The Starrett Associates invested $22 million into the construction of the complex, while the remaining $360 million was covered by state housing loans under the Mitchell-Lama program. = Opening and early years = The complex was dedicated on October 13, 1974, in a ceremony attended by Governor Malcolm Wilson and Mayor Abraham Beame. As part of the opening, a minibus service was created to transport local residents within the development, and to shopping centers in other parts of Brooklyn. In addition, the express bus service to Manhattan was extended to from Canarsie to Starrett City. At the time of opening, none of the complex's proposed 18,000 trees had been planted. Although lower-income families were not given subsidies to live in Starrett City, the development did allow residents to use state and federal housing programs to pay off part of their rent. The first 300 families were scheduled to move into the complex that November. In January 1975, community leaders and officials proposed rerouting five bus routes and creating two new routes to serve the complex. Pennsylvania Avenue was reopened to traffic that December, sparking protests by residents who had previously used the street to play. By 1976, two thousand families had moved into Starrett City. A swimming and tennis club on Van Siclen Avenue was dedicated in July 1978. Families who lived in the complex had to pay $250 per year to use the swimming and tennis club. The swimming and tennis club was dedicated alongside a recreation center at the same location, which was open to the public. The same month, Starrett City celebrated its five thousandth resident. At this point, Starrett City was 85% rented. By 1981, the presence of Starrett City was credited with spurring six other developments in the neighborhood, including a shopping mall at Flatlands and Louisiana Avenues, as well as five housing developments. Crime in the complex was lower than in the surrounding neighborhoods, primarily because of the presence of a private security force. On the other hand, rents at Starrett City started to rise by the late 1970s, leading to fears that existing middle-class residents might leave and be replaced by low-income residents. At the same time, Starrett City was facing financial troubles because it had been built in the aftermath of the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis. In 1980, a New York State Comptroller's report found that Starrett City would have a nearly $30 million deficit by 1984, and that rents would have to be doubled from the then-current rates in order to make up for the deficit. By 1992, Starrett City Associates was developing additional housing around the Starrett City complex. The new housing units were condominiums, targeted toward Starrett City residents and others who wanted ownership of their homes. In 1993, the Amalgamated Bank of New York loaned $1.5 million for repairs to Starrett at Spring Creek. The complex was renamed \\"Starrett at Spring Creek\\" around 1989. On September 25, 2002, the complex was again renamed \\"Spring Creek Towers\\". The second renaming was part of a $70 million capital program to renovate the complex. The plans called for Spring Creek Towers to receive two new parks, as well as new elevators, laundry rooms, windows, and lighting. =Sale offerings= Starrett City buildings viewed from Pennsylvania Avenue On November 30, 2006, Starrett City Associates announced an offering to sell the entire property. Since the property had met its 20-year requirement under Mitchell-Lama by the late 1990s, this raised fears that a new owner would increase rents and squeeze out current tenants. CB Richard Ellis, which brokered the Stuyvesant Town‚ÄìPeter Cooper Village deal earlier in 2006, served as the listing agent. Upon finding out about the sale, tenants at Starrett City began organizing in response to the sale of their homes. On February 8, 2007, Starrett City Associates agreed to sell the sprawling complex to David Bistricer's Clipper Equity LLC for $1.3 billion. Although the buyers insisted that the complex would remain affordable, housing advocates and politicians expressed concerns about Clipper's intentions.Mayor wary of new Starrett owners , The Real Deal, February 9, 2007 In response to HUD's rejection of the deal, Clipper Equity proposed a new bid, which included reducing operating expenses and redeveloping part of the land into new housing. Clipper Equity took other steps to garner support, including receiving informal backing from influential ministers Rev. Calvin O. Butts and Rev. A. R. Bernard. On April 7, 2007, the second proposal was also rejected by the U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, on the basis that Clipper Equity's plan for rents to reach market rate after three years failed to adequately protect residents and would require increased government subsidies to keep housing affordable. Nevertheless, Clipper Equity made another attempt in August 2007. In June 2008, Starrett City Associates reached an agreement with Federal, State and City officials on a sale process that would ensure that the property remained affordable. This agreement was further buttressed by federal legislation, which made preserving the property as affordable housing easier for a new buyer. On September 6, 2017, The New York Times reported that the complex was being sold to the Brooksville Company and Rockpoint Group for $850 million. Trump owns a 4% share, while other members of his family own an additional 16%. However, disagreements soon developed between two groups affiliated with Disque Deane, who had died in 2010 and left his estate to his third wife Carol G. Deane and their two children. Carol, who managed Starrett City Associates following Disque's death. became involved in a lawsuit with a collective that included four of Disque's children; one of his former partners; and LIHC Investment Group and Belveron Partners, who were also interested in purchasing the complex. The two groups sued each other in New York Supreme Court over allegations that Carol's sale of Starrett City to Brooksville and Rockpoint did not maximize profits for shareholders. The lawsuit was later dismissed, and the sale of Starrett City was completed on May 8, 2018, at a cost of $905 million.  Community and demographics Starrett City is a racially diverse neighborhood. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Starrett City was 13,354, a change of ‚àí1,267 (‚àí9.5%) from the 14,621 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre ‚Äì New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division ‚Äì New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012. Accessed June 16, 2016. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 24.7% (3,293) White, 52.7% (7,036) African American, 0.2% (29) Native American, 2.9% (389) Asian, 0% (2) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (37) from other races, and 1.4% (184) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 17.9% (2,384) of the population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin ‚Äì New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division ‚Äì New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016. =Racial quota controversies= Since its opening in 1975, Starrett City had filled vacancies under an affirmative action racial formula in which 70% of vacant apartments went to non-Hispanic white families, and the remaining 30% went to minority families. In 1977, the minority makeup was 19% black, 9% Hispanic, and 2% Asian. By 1979, the proportion of white residents had declined to 64%. At the time, most of the advertisements for Starrett City featured white applicants, but much of the resulting applicant pool was black or Hispanic. As a result of the quotas, black applicants who wanted apartments in Starrett City waited almost eight times as long as white applicants. By 1983, the complex's 5,881 apartments were fully occupied, and three-fourths of the 6,000 families on Starrett City's waiting list were minorities. In 1979, the NAACP initiated a class- action suit against Starrett City Associates. The plaintiffs stated that the complex attempted to maintain racial quotas by selective approval of tenants based on racial and ethnic profiles. An agreement was made in May 1984. Starrett City Associates agreed to increase the minority quota by 5%, so that the ratio of non-Hispanic white to minority families was 65% to 35%. The formula was supported by many black and Hispanic residents and some civil rights groups. In June 1984, the Reagan administration sued Starrett City over the racial quota system, stating that it violated federal anti-discrimination laws. The original accord was approved by federal judge Edward Raymond Neaher of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in April 1985, but the ruling did not affect the Reagan administration's lawsuit. In 1987, Neaher ruled on the federal government's lawsuit, stating that the quotas violated the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and thereby invalidating the quotas. The case went all the way to the United States Supreme Court. In March 1988, a federal appeals court ruled that the lower court's order to prevent quotas must stand. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court in the fall of 1988, and the court ruled against Starrett City Associates. By 1988, under Starrett City Associates' quota system, 62% of apartments were rented to whites, 23% to blacks, 9% to Hispanics and 6% to other minority groups. The group agreed to stop using quotas in November 1988. After losing the court case, Starrett City did not immediately start taking families from the 80% African-American waiting list to fill vacancies. Instead, they left apartments empty and attempted to rent them at market rate to those who would not qualify for subsidies. In July 1990, Starrett City Associates proposed to make apartments available to Soviet Jews who came to the United States in order to maintain racial diversity. However, critics stated that this was a move to circumvent the Supreme Court ruling. Starrett City Associates rescinded their proposal to rent to Soviet Jews after heavy criticism. The New York state government instead housed the Soviet Jewish families in Co-op City, a similar development in the Bronx.

They involve the adventures of a dumb family of bunnies. The Dumb Bunnies did everything in reverse, including sleeping under beds and putting flowers upside down in vases. The series is said to be mocking or parodying books like Good Night Moon by Margaret Wise Brown and The Stupids Step Out by Harry G. Allard and illustrated by James Marshall. Television series  It was also adapted into a television series made in Canada, China, and Australia, in 1998, created by Home Box Office, Seven Network, Cartoon Network, Pella American company Scholastic, Canadian company Nelvana, and Australian company Yoram Gross- Village Roadshow The show ran for twenty-six episodes from October 3, 1998 to September 26, 1999. In Australia, the show ran on Seven Network. =Episodes= Book appearances The Dumb Bunnies first appeared in the book The Dumb Bunnies. In the book the Dumb Bunnies are having porridge when they decide to go for a walk. They go to Kentucky Fried Carrots (parody of Kentucky Fried Chicken) and have a picnic in the car wash. Meanwhile, Little Red Goldilocks enters their home. When the Dumb Bunnies return, they are thrilled to see her. But Poppa Bunny is embarrassed because he thought someone slept on his porridge. Momma Bunny is angry because she thought someone ate her bed. Baby Bunny cries because he thinks someone used his pimple cream. Then Papa Bunny dances, Mama Bunny sings a song, and Baby Bunny flushes Little Red Goldilocks down the toilet. At the end of the book, a picture on the back cover shows her coming out of a sewer pipe and landing in a lake. Note: The cover originally had the word \\"spam\\" on the bowl of porridge, which Pilkey claims was meant to be a joke, until the Hormel Foods Corporation threatened legal action, causing either a recall of the book or placing a golden sticker on it until a reprint was made without the word. The Spam covers have now become extremely hard to find. The Dumb Bunnies made their second appearance in the book The Dumb Bunnies Easter. The Dumb Bunnies are preparing for Easter (which appears to be more related to Christmas) and set up the decorations (including putting an \\"Easter Tree\\" upside down). After preparing, they spray- paint fried eggs (claimed to be \\"painting Easter Eggs\\") and watch a small football on top of their television. They go to hang up their stockings before they realize that they are wearing them and they are sleeping upside down in front of the fireplace. The Easter Bunny soon arrives and drops all the eggs down the chimney. The next morning, the Dumb Bunnies are thrilled to see the eggs (although they are completely cracked with shells lying everywhere). Their third appearance was in the book Make Way for Dumb Bunnies. While the Dumb Bunnies are spending quality time at home, it suddenly starts raining. They think it is a perfect day to go to the beach and they head there. But then the sun comes out and they think it is bad weather, so they head to the movie theater (accidentally stealing a car in the process). During the movie, the Dumb Bunnies think the projector is the screen, which blinds them for a while. They return home on a steamroller (which they thought was their car) and regain vision again. The Dumb Bunnies latest appearance is in the book The Dumb Bunnies Go to the Zoo. They first go outside to pick things in their garden (using pickaxes). They later drive to the zoo, only to discover the animals they are seeing are a lot smaller than they really are (they mistake a small bird perched on the \\"Elephant\\" sign as being the elephant and a butterfly perched on the \\"Lion\\" sign as being the lion). When the butterfly flutters off the sign they think the lion escaped and go crazy all over the zoo and letting all the animals loose (including the \\"real\\" lion). The S.W.A.T. cops arrive to capture the lion, but the Dumb Bunnies say he flew away. As they leave the zoo (the book says that they decide to go home, but they really got kicked out by the zookeeper), they come across two giant apes which they mistake for being \\"Free Kitties\\" (the box that the words were written on did contain real kittens, but when the apes climbed over the wall, they scared all the kittens, and the owner who carried the box, away). Baby Bunny decides to keep them, but as they drive out, the apes fall off the top of the car they had been tied to. They return home at the end of the day and get into their new waterbed (with a series of hoses spraying water on the bed) and fall asleep.  Challenges  In 2010, The Dumb Bunnies Go to the Zoo was placed on the \\"Most Challenged Books of 2010\\" list that was published by the Canadian Library Association. Again, this particular book was challenged ‚Äì this time in Oregon for \\"concern that reading this book may result in confusion and stupidity.\\" The book was retained in the library. Because of the \\"sarcastic view of humor\\", the series was challenged in Summit County and was moved out the primary library and into the intermediate library. The original book was challenged in Texas because of parent complaints that the book depicted violence.

","title":"Forever and Ever"},{"id":"2537506","text":"Over is a former borough and market town that forms the western part of the town of Winsford in the English county of Cheshire. Wharton forms the eastern part, the boundary being the River Weaver. History =Ancient origins= Over owes its origins to the Ice Age when melt waters from the last ice sheet left a long line of sand expanding from near Frodsham in the north to beyond Nantwich in the south. The main road through Delamere Street and Swanlow Lane follows this line and is about above sea level. A mile or so to the east, the River Weaver cuts a deep valley through the glacial clay. As there are few real hills in central Cheshire it would have been an ideal site for early settlers, who generally avoided valleys. Prehistoric tools have occasionally been found along the route, showing that the area had been used for many thousands of years before the first mention of the name in the Domesday Book of 1086. =Saxon times= The earliest evidence of anyone living in the area is the piece of a Saxon stone cross, which was found between the World Wars when St Chad's Church was altered. The fragment is on display near the organ today. Saint Chad was the first bishop of the Midlands in the 7th Century. There are various churches dedicated to him in Cheshire and throughout the Midlands. As it is recorded that he travelled around converting the pagans, it is possible that he converted early converts in a spring in what might have been a sacred valley at the edge of the forest. The ancient churchyard of the St Chad's church still shows a circular shape, which is usually a clue to an ancient, and often Pre-Christian, foundation. No church however is mentioned in the written records before the time of the Normans. =Norman rule= The Norman Earls of Chester had a hunting lodge or summer palace at Darnhall in Over parish. There was an enclosed area where deer and wild boar were kept to be hunted by the Earl and his guests. It was there that the last Norman Earl met his death. It was rumoured that his wife, Helen the daughter of the Prince of Wales, had poisoned him to favour the powerful aristocrat that her daughter had married. However, as this was the time of the Barons' Wars, King Henry III took control of the county and of the manor himself and even spent time at Darnhall. It was during this time that the brook there was dammed to drive three water mills and to make pools to keep fish. The first mention of a priest is in 1307 when a Thomas de Dutton is mentioned, but it uncertain if this was at St.Chad's or as a chaplain at Darnhall, or both. The church and responsibility for the parish was given to St. Mary's convent in Chester, who appointed the priests in charge. =King Edward I and the foundation of Vale Royal Abbey= When Henry's son Edward was old enough, he was made Earl of Chester and took great pride in the county. On becoming King Edward I he granted several town charters for markets and defended Chester in readiness for wars in Wales. He also made a vow to found an abbey in Cheshire when he was in danger of shipwreck. As he had visited Darnhall and knew its quiet secluded setting, he chose this area as a site for Cistercian monks. This religious order chose to live in the wildest places possible, bringing their farming skills to clear forest and to bring unused land into use for farming. A group of monks arrived from Dore Abbey in Herefordshire to set up the new abbey, but they were soon allowed to move to a better site that we now know as Vale Royal Abbey. In 1277 the King and Queen arrived in the Parish of Over to lay the foundation stones of the new abbey, which was planned to be the biggest of its kind in the country. Although the Abbot became lord of the manor, the church and parish remained the property of the convent at Chester so Over paid tithes to both the Abbey and Convent. =A borough charter= Walter, the second Abbot of Vale Royal Abbey, laid out land on either side of Delamere Street in a series of matching \\"burgage plots\\". Each one was suitable for building a house, forming a garden and/or orchard and have space to keep a pig or cow. The plan of the 13th-century borough is still visible in the modern garden plots. The borough was allowed to have a weekly market and a livestock fair once a year. It had to maintain a prison and pillory for wrongdoers and the mayor acted as the judge in trials within the borough. Fuel was provided by allowing residents to dig peat from a bog near Blakeden Lane. The remains of these peat cuttings were only filled in during 2005‚Äì06. Every year the Burgesses (those who owned a burgage plot) elected a Court Leet, rather like a cross between a town council and a magistrates' bench, to govern the borough. They selected one of their number to be mayor for a year but this position had to be confirmed by the Abbot. The original charter is in the Harleian Manuscripts, owned by the Earls of Oxford, and was one of the original donations of antiquities and documents left to the nation which prompted the foundation of the British Museum (its books and manuscripts later to become the British Library) in the 18th century. The stone bases of wayside crosses at Salterswall and Marston mark the boundary between the abbey lands and the borough. The large base at Marton is sometimes called a \\"wishing seat\\", with an early record stating it was set up by order of Edward I to mark the boundary. =Disaster= The great plans for Vale Royal Abbey, upon which the early prosperity of Over depended, came to an end when first the great castle-building programme of Edward I stripped it of funds and then the Black Death killed half of the population. When the plague cleared, there were empty spaces to be used up and ambitious men took advantage of this. This caused friction with the Abbot leading to several incidents culminating in a revolt when the local peasants took their case to the Justice of Chester and even to the Queen herself, asking for her to plead their case to the King. The King, however, decided in favour of the Abbot and all the men (and one woman) who had taken over lands had to give them up. The rebels were imprisoned at Weaverham. The combination of the Abbey and the Convent competing for tithes stifled growth. =New owners= In 1545 Vale Royal Abbey and its lands were sold during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, with Over being purchased by Thomas Holcroft for ¬£466.10s.1d who sold it almost at once to Edmund Pershall. Pershall was a London merchant who saw his purchase as a long term investment. He got regular rents and hoped the properties would increase in value. Over was sold in the middle of the 17th Century to Thomas Cholmondeley, son of Lady Mary Cholmondeley who had purchased Vale Royal Abbey. =Civil War= In 1643, Royalists escaping from Nantwich \\"sacked\\" Over. The situation during the English Civil War was very dangerous to everyone ‚Äì proof of this was discovered when workmen in Nixon Drive found a little black ale mug full of silver coins, with a date range from Queen Elizabeth I to 1643. The coins were declared treasure trove and are now at the Grosvenor Museum in Chester. =Later 17th century= A silver mace was presented by the owner of Vale Royal Abbey mansion in this time, although it is unclear exactly by whom and when. It is still in the possession of Winsford Town Council. Daniel King, who published his history of Cheshire in 1656, described Over thus: \\"tis but a small thing, but I place it here because of the great prerogative that it has, for it had a mayor\\". He included it in the list of boroughs of Cheshire for, despite being a tiny village, its mayor was of equal rank to the mayor of Chester. =18th century= Robert Nixon, sometimes known as the 'Palatine Prophet' and who came from Over, may have lived at this time. The Government gave permission for artificial improvements to be made to the River Weaver in 1721 to allow large barges to reach Winsford from the port of Liverpool. At first, this was the closest that barges carrying china clay from Cornwall could get to The Potteries. The clay was then taken overland by pack horses, who in turn would bring back the finished china to be sent for export through Liverpool. In 1744, the manager of the wharf, George Wood, took control of the trade between Winsford and Stoke. He made a reasonable fortune and built Oak House, which remained a farm just off Beeston Drive before the land was purchased to build the Over Estate and Oak house remained until the mid 1980‚Äôs as the de Witt family residents when the land was taken by the town council for private housing and Oak House was demolished. That trade ended in the 1780s when the Trent and Mersey Canal carried the goods through Middlewich and bypassed the town. The canalised Weaver was, however, the inspiration for the Duke of Bridgewater's canals and later the engineer for the Weaver Navigation, Edwin Leader Williams, designed and built the Manchester Ship Canal. =19th Century ‚Äì The time of salt= The Salt industry became firmly established in Winsford from the 1830s, bringing with it massive pollution. As the wind usually blew away from Over, it became the popular place for more wealthy people in the town to live. However, people who worked on the barges and other people working in Winsford started to develop along the old Over Lane, now the High Street. The old Borough tried to keep itself separate but had been connected by the 1860s. In 1869 Abraham Haigh built a cotton mill at the end of what would become Well Street. He used the water supply trapped in the sand enclosed by clay on the Over Ridge to power steam engines. However, almost as soon as the building was completed most of it was destroyed, killing some of the workers who were then buried in a communal grave at St John's church where a monument records their names. A town fire engine, although ordered, had not yet been delivered by the time of the fire. The last mayor of Over was Edmund Leigh who held office during the Diamond Jubilee of 1897. The mayoral status of Over was by then a purely ceremonial affair as the right of the mayor to sit in court as a magistrate had by then been removed. Baron Delamere, the major local landowner sold most of his considerable property in the town in 1912, resisting the giving of the mace and title to the newly formed Winsford Urban District Council (possibly because he wanted to sell them). The mace was therefore taken back to Vale Royal Abbey and Sir William Verdin gave Winsford a new silver mace to mark the coronation of George V. In 1946 Baron Delamere's son, who had settled in Kenya, returned the old mace to Winsford when he sold the remaining family land.

While in Guam, Calungsod preached Christianity to the Chamorro people through catechesis, while baptizing infants, children and adults at the risk and expense of being persecuted and eventually murdered. Through Calungsod and San Vitores's missionary efforts, many native Chamorros converted to Roman Catholicism. Calungsod was beatified on March 5, 2000, by Pope John Paul II, and canonized by Pope Benedict XVI at Saint Peter's Basilica in Vatican City on October 21, 2012.EWTN Televised Broadcast: Public Consistory for the Creation of New Cardinals.

Early years and missionary work Queen Mariana of Austria, Regent of Spain, the benefactress of the mission to the Ladrones Islands later named in her honour. =Birthplace dispute= Few details of the early life of Calungsod (spelled Calonsor in Spanish records) are known. Historical records do not mention his exact birthplace or birth date, and merely identified him as \\"Pedro Calonsor, el Visayo\\". Historical research identifies Ginatilan in Cebu, Hinunangan and Hinundayan in Southern Leyte, and the Molo district of Iloilo City as possible places of origin; Loboc, Bohol also makes a claim. Of these claims, the ones from Molo, Iloilo and Ginatilan, Cebu, are considered the strongest. Nonetheless, all four locations were within the Diocese of Cebu at the time of Calungsod's martyrdom. Proponents of an Ilonggo origin argue that in the early Spanish period, the term \\"Visayan\\" exclusively referred to people from the islands of Negros or Panay, whereas people from Cebu, Bohol and Leyte were called \\"Pintados\\".G. Nye Steiger, H. Otley Beyer, Conrado Benitez, A History of the Orient, Oxford: 1929, Ginn and Company, pp. 122‚Äì123. Thus, had he been born in Cebu he would have been referred to as \\"Calonsor El Pintado\\" instead of \\"Calonsor El Visayo\\"; the term \\"Visayan\\" receiving its present scope (i.e., including inhabitants of Cebu, Bohol and Leyte) sometime the 1700s. However, American historian and scholar John N. Schumacher disputes the Bisaya/Pintados dichotomy claim as at that time the Pintados were also referred to as Visayans regardless of location and said Calungsod \\"was a Visayan\\" and may have been but doubtfully \\"from the island of Cebu\\" or \\"could have come any other Visayas islands.\\"\\"Pedro 'was Visayan, and came possibly, but very doubtfully, from the island of Cebu. He could have come any other Visayas islands.\\" http://journals.ateneo.edu/ojs/landas/article/view/882/912 The Cebu camp reasoned that Ginatilan contains a high density of people surnamed Calungsod, and that during the beatification process they were the initial claimants to having been Calungsod's birthplace. The Calungsods of Iloilo also claim to be the oldest branch, based on baptismal records containing the surname \\"Calungsod\\" dating to circa 1748, compared to branches in Cebu and Leyte which possess baptismal records dating only to 1828 and 1903, respectively. =Training and arrival in Guam= In Guam, Calungsod received basic education at a Jesuit boarding school, mastering the Catechism and learning to communicate in Spanish. He also likely honed his skills in drawing, painting, singing, acting, and carpentry, as these were necessary in missionary work. In 1668, Calungsod, then around 14, was amongst the young catechists chosen to accompany Spanish Jesuit missionaries to the Islas de los Ladrones (\\"Isles of Thieves\\"), which had been renamed the Mariana Islands the year before to honor both the Virgin Mary and the mission's benefactress, Mar√≠a Ana of Austria, Queen Regent of Spain. Calungsod accompanied the priest Diego San Vitores to Guam to catechize the native Chamorros. Missionary life on the island was difficult as provisions did not arrive regularly, the jungles and terrain were difficult to traverse, and the Marianas were frequently devastated by typhoons. The mission nevertheless persevered, and a significant number of locals were baptized.Blessed Pedro Calungsod ‚Äì Biography. Pedrocalungsod.page.tl (March 5, 2000). Retrieved on 2016-06-25.  Martyrdom  A Chinese man named Choco, a criminal from Manila who was exiled in Guam, began spreading rumors that the baptismal water used by missionaries was poisonous. As some sickly Chamorro infants who were baptized eventually died, many believed the story and held the missionaries responsible. Choco was readily supported by the macanjas (medicine men) and the urritaos (young males) who despised the missionaries. In their search for a runaway companion named Esteban, Calungsod and San Vitores came to the village of Tumon, Guam, on April 2, 1672. There they learnt that the wife of the village's chief Mata'pang had given birth to a daughter, and they immediately went to baptize the child. Influenced by the calumnies of Choco, Chief Mata'pang strongly opposed;''Interea, illa infans puellula, christiana eius matre consentiente, sacramentali baptismatis lavacro est abluta.'' Translation: In the meantime, that an infant girl, Christian with the consent of her mother, cleansed by the washing of sacramental baptism. Vatican.va. Retrieved on June 25, 2016. to give him some time to calm down, the missionaries gathered the children and some adults of the village at the nearby shore and started chanting with them the tenets of the Catholic faith. They invited Mata'pang to join them, but he shouted back that he was angry with God and was fed up with Christian teachings. Determined to kill the missionaries, Mata'pang went away and tried to enlist another villager, a pagan named Hirao. The latter initially refused, mindful of the missionaries' kindness towards the natives, but became piqued and eventually capitulated when Mata'pang branded him a coward. While Mata'pang was away from his house, San Vitores and Calungsod baptized the baby girl, with the consent of her Christian mother. When Mata'pang learnt of his daughter's baptism, he became even more furious. He violently hurled spears first at Calungsod, who was able to dodge them. Witnesses claim that Calungsod could have escaped the attack, but did not desert San Vitores. Those who knew personally Calungsod considered his martial abilities and that he could have defeated the aggressors with weapons; San Vitores had however banned his companions from bearing arms. Calungsod was struck with a spear in the chest and fell to the ground; Hirao immediately charged towards him and finished him off with machete blow to the head. San Vitores quickly absolved Calungsod before he too was killed. Mata'pang took San Vitores's crucifix and pounded it with a stone whilst blaspheming God. Both assassins then undressed the corpses of both Calungsod and San Vitores, tied large stones to the feet, and after loading these on their proas, dumped the bodies out in Tumon Bay. The Catholic Church considers Calungsod's martyrdom to have been committed In Odium Fidei ('In Hatred of the Faith').''Pietro Calungsod, catechista, che per odio verso la fede cristiana furono uccisi e gettati in mare da alcuni apostati e seguaci locali di superstizioni pagane.'' Translation: Peter Calungsod, catechist, due to hatred of the Christian faith was killed and thrown overboard by some apostates and followers of local pagan superstitions. Vatican.va. Retrieved on June 25, 2016. Beatification A month after the martyrdom of San Vitores and Calungsod, a process for beatification was initiated but only for San Vitores. Political and religious turmoil, however, delayed and halted the process for centuries. In 1981, as Hag√•t√±a was preparing for its 20th anniversary as a diocese, the 1673 beatification cause of San Vitores was rediscovered in old manuscripts and revived until he was finally beatified on October 6, 1985. This also gave recognition to Calungsod, paving the way for his own beatification. In 1980, then-Archbishop of Cebu Ricardo Cardinal Vidal asked permission from the Vatican to initiate Calungsod's beatification and canonization cause. In March 1997, the Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the acta of the diocesan beatification process. That same year, Cardinal Vidal appointed Fr Ildebrando Leyson as vice-postulator for the cause, tasked with compiling a Positio Super Martyrio (\\"position regarding the martyrdom\\") to be scrutinized by the Congregation. The positio, which relied heavily on the documentation of San Vitores's beatification, was completed in 1999.cebuarchdiocese.org. cebuarchdiocese.org. Retrieved on June 25, 2016. Wanting to include young Asian laypersons in his first beatification for the Great Jubilee in 2000, Pope John Paul II paid particular attention to the cause of Calungsod.

The recognized miracle dates from March 26, 2003, when a woman from Leyte, pronounced clinically dead two hours after a heart attack, was revived when an attending physician invoked Calungsod's intercession. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the declaration ceremony on behalf of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. He later revealed that Pope Benedict XVI had approved and signed the official promulgation decrees recognising the miracles as authentic and worthy of belief. The College of Cardinals were then sent a dossier on the new saints, and they were asked to indicate their approval.

An extensive research provided by the census research of Ginatilan, Cebu provided a longstanding record of Calonsor and Calungsod natives from their area, from which a strong claim had the most Calungsod natives originating since Filipino-Spanish era since the late 1700s. According to the Parish Pastoral Council William Pancho of Ginatilan, Cebu, there is a strong claim that in the mid-1600s, there were three Calungsod brothers: * Valerio Calungsod who migrated to Iloilo * Casimiro Calungsod who migrated to Bohol * Pablo Calungsod who remained in Ginatilan, Cebu, and was the father of Pedro Calungsod. In a public televised interview with ABS-CBN chief correspondent and newscaster Korina Sanchez, Cardinal Ricardo Jamin Vidal emphasized his dismay that when the original beatification of Pedro Calungsod began in the 1980s, no province except for Ginatilan, Cebu, wanted to make a claim on his place of birth. Consequently, when the canonization was approved, Catholic bishops from the provinces of Cebu, Bohol, Leyte, Samar, and Iloilo and various Mindanao provinces wanted to claim Calungsod's official birthplace. As a result, Cardinal Vidal ruled that he will not establish a definitive judgment on his birthplace, since Spanish records only indicate the words \\"Pedro Calonsor, El Visayo\\" as his native description. Furthermore, he stated that all Visayan provinces were under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Cebu during the Filipino-Spanish era.  Iconography  Calungsod is often portrayed holding a Catechism book, notably the \\"Doctrina Christiana\\". Only known surviving copy by Fray Juan de Plasencia. Library of Congress, Washington D.C. Circa 1590s. It is not known what Calungsod looked like, as no contemporary depictions survive. The writer Alcina, who was a contemporary of Pedro Calungsod, described the male Visayan indios of his time as usually more corpulent, better built and somewhat taller than the Tagalogs in Luzon; that their skin was light brown in color; that their faces were usually round and of fine proportions; that their noses were flat; that their eyes and hair were black; that they ‚Äì especially the youth ‚Äì wore their hair a little bit long; and that they already started to wear camisas (shirts) and calzones (knee-breeches). Pedro Chirino, S.J., who also worked in the Visayas in the 1590s, similarly described the Visayans as well-built, of pleasing countenance and light-skinned. Calungsod is often depicted as a teenaged young man wearing a camisa de chino that is sometimes bloodied, and usually dark, loose trousers. His most popular attributes are the martyr's palm pressed to his chest and the Doctrina Christiana. To indicate his missionary status, he is depicted in mid-stride, occasionally also bearing a rosary or crucifix. In some early statues Calungsod is shown with a spear and catana (cutlass), the instruments of his death. = In art = The first portrayals stated to be of Pedro Calungsod were drawings made by Eduardo Castrillo in 1994 for the Heritage of Cebu Monument in Parian. A bronze statue representing Calungsod was made and forms part of the monument. Sculptors Francisco dela Victoria and Vicente Gulane of Cebu and Justino Cagayat, Jr., of Paete, Laguna, created statues representing Calungsod in 1997 and 1999 respectively. When the Archdiocese of Manila in 1998 published the pamphlet Pedro Calungsod: Young Visayan \\"Proto-Martyr\\" by theologian Catalino Arevalo, SJ, the 17-year-old Ronald Tubid of Oton, Iloilo, then a student-athlete at the University of the East, was chosen to model for a portrait representing Calungsod. This became the basis for Rafael del Casal's painting in 1999, which was chosen as the official portrait for Calungsod. The Del Casal image is the first to feature a Christogram, the seal of the Society of Jesus, with which Calungsod was affiliated. The original painting is now enshrined at the Archdiocesan Shrine of Saint Pedro Calungsod in Cebu City. Several statues representing Calungsod were also commissioned for the beatification, with one brought to Rome and blessed by John Paul II. This became the \\"Pilgrim Image\\", now enshrined at the Archdiocesan Shrine of the Black Nazarene of the Society of the Angel of Peace in Cansojong, Talisay City, Cebu. Another image was enshrined at the Archdiocesan Shrine of Saint Pedro Calungsod in Cebu City. Both images depict Calungsod wearing a white camisa (shirt) and trousers, with the martyr's palm, a rosary, and a crucifix pressed to his breast. During the novena before his feast day, a replica of the catana used to kill him is set into the arm of the statue. For the canonization celebrations, the chosen sculpture by Justino Cagayat, Jr., represented Calungsod in mid-stride and carrying the Doctrina Christiana and the martyr's palm pressed to his chest. This image was brought to Rome for the canonization festivities. Upon its return to the Philippines, the image toured the country. When not on a pilgrimage tour, the image is enshrined at the Cebu Archdiocesan Shrine of Saint Pedro Calungsod in the archbishop's residence. = In film = Pedro Calungsod: Batang Martir is a Filipino film with Rocco Nacino in the title role released on December 25, 2013, as an official entry to the 2013 Metro Manila Film Festival.

It was founded and edited by Ted Byfield, and later run by his son, Link Byfield. It ceased publication in 2003. Promoting his own successor publication in 2004, Ezra Levant described the Report as having been the only general interest magazine in Western Canada covering the news from a conservative perspective. History and profile In 1973, Byfield returned to journalism by publishing the St. John's Edmonton Report, a local paper, as part of the operations of the Company of the Cross, a lay Anglican religious order, also co-founded by Byfield, which included a series of traditional Anglican private boarding school for boys, starting with the Saint John's Cathedral Boys' School in 1957. The minister of St. John's School, Keith T. Bennett, served on the original editorial board. In the early years the school and the magazine operated under the same system where staff lived in a communal apartment block and everyone worked for a dollar a day plus room and board. The St. John's Edmonton Report combined Byfield's interest in journalism, current affairs and his desire to use media to education others about Christian values. It provided a space for Byfield to comment on \\"homosexuals, abortionists, human rights commissions and public education\\" which he strongly opposed. Prior to the establishment of the Alberta Report in 1979, Byfield also launched theSt. John's Calgary Report in 1977. When the two magazines were merged into the Alberta Report, Byfield shifted the business model from that of the lay order to a more commercial enterprise to attract a higher quality of journalists. The emergence of the Alberta Report coincided with Alberta's energy wars with the federal government. Byfield's Report provided the voice for Western Canada's growing sense of discontent and alienation in the 1970s and 1980s. In response to the province of Quebec called for separation, Byfield wrote about \\"western separatism\\", The magazine became so popular in Alberta, that the circulation reached a record average of 53,277 a week by 1987. In the late 1980s as the economy of Alberta declined, so did the circulation. In 1990 a group of Calgary oil magnates offered to buy the report in an effort to provide financial stability to a journal they regarded as politically congenial. The magazine was published for a time in three separate editions, the Alberta Report, BC Report, and Western Report. These were merged in 1999 into The Report, later known as the Citizens Centre Report in connection with Link Byfield's successor organization, the Citizens Centre for Freedom and Democracy. The magazine often struggled financially, with the senior Byfield mortgaging his own house four times to keep it afloat. It shut down in June 2003. According to the Edmonton Sun, some employees were still owed back pay nearly six months later, and complained when the Citizens Centre was directing money toward its political agenda. A number of right-wing journalists and commentators in Canada who are prominent today began their careers writing for The Report magazines, including Kenneth Whyte, the editor in chief of Maclean's; Colby Cosh of the National Post, Kevin Michael Grace, Lorne Gunter, Ezra Levant, Brian Mulawka, and Kevin Steel. Other former staff include: freelance journalist Ric Dolphin, former National Post writer Dunnery Best, U.S. food writer (and founding editor of Equinox magazine) Barry Estabrook, former Profit editor and publisher Rick Spence, author D'Arcy Jenish, and Paul Bunner, who in 2006 became a speechwriter for Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Bunner is currently speech writer for Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. C.P. (Chris) Champion started The Dorchester Review, a small but influential history magazine, in 2011, and in 2020 served as a curriculum advisor under Minister of Education, Andrea LaGrange. The Western Standard, launched in 2004, by Levant with the participation of several other Report alumni, aimed to fill the space in the market that had been held by the Report. The Standard became an exclusively online publication in 2007. Topics In the 1990s AR produced a number of articles expressing opposition to a possible amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) that would prohibit discrimination against homosexuals. In the wake of the successful lawsuit against the government of Alberta for wrongful sterilization, launched by Leilani Muir, and the subsequent 1995 trial on eugenics, the weekly magazine published five articles on eugenics from 1995 and 1999. The articles covered the court case, placing it into an historical context. A 1995 article by Joe Woodward and a 1996 article by Chris Champion investigated the decision by the University of Alberta to remove the name of the John M. MacEachran (1877 ‚Äì 1971)‚Äîco-founder of the Canadian Psychological Association and the Alberta Eugenics Board's chairman responsible for the forced sterilizations‚Äîfrom several scholarships and a library at the University.

Biologists involved in fundamental research attempt to explore and further explain the underlying mechanisms that govern the functioning of living matter. Biologists involved in applied research attempt to develop or improve more specific processes and understanding, in fields such as medicine and industry. Biologists are interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern the functioning of living matter as well as the complex properties that emerge from the biophysical, biochemical, cellular and systemic interactions of living systems. Biologists conduct research using the scientific method to test the validity of a theory in a rational, unbiased and reproducible manner. This consists of hypothesis formation, experimentation and data analysis to establish the validity or invalidity of a scientific theory. There are different types of biologists. Theoretical biologists use mathematical methods and develop models to understand phenomena and ideally predict future experimental results, while experimental biologists conceive experiments to test those predictions. Some biologists work on microorganisms, while others study multicellular organisms (including humans). Some investigate the nano or micro-scale, others emergent properties such as ecological interactions or cognition. There is much overlap between different fields of biology (e.g. zoology, microbiology, genetics and evolutionary biology) and due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field it is often difficult to classify a life scientist as only one of them. Many biological scientists work in research and development. Some conduct fundamental research to advance human knowledge of life. Furthermore, applied biological research often aids the development of solutions to problems in areas such as human health and the natural environment. Biological scientists mostly work in government, university, and private industry laboratories. Research Martinus Willem Beijerinck, a botanist and microbiologist Biologists who work in basic research formulate theories and devise experiments to advance human knowledge on life including topics such as evolution, biochemistry, molecular biology, neuroscience and cell biology. Biological scientists who work in applied research use instead the accomplishments gained by basic research to further knowledge in particular fields or applications. For example, this applied research may be used to develop new pharmaceutical drugs, treatments and medical diagnostic tests. Biological scientists conducting applied research and product development in private industry may be required to describe their research plans or results to non-scientists who are in a position to veto or approve their ideas. These scientists must consider the business effects of their work. While theoretical biologists usually work in \\"dry\\" labs, formulating mathematical models and running computer simulations, some experimental biologists conduct laboratory experiments involving animals, plants, microorganisms or biomolecules. However, a small part of experimental biological research also occurs outside the laboratory and may involve natural observation rather than experimentation. For example, a botanist may investigate the plant species present in a particular environment, while an ecologist might study how a forest area recovers after a fire. Swift advances in knowledge of genetics and organic molecules spurred growth in the field of biotechnology, transforming the industries in which biological scientists work. Biological scientists can now manipulate the genetic material of animals and plants, attempting to make organisms (including humans) more productive or resistant to disease. Basic and applied research on biotechnological processes, such as recombining DNA, has led to the production of important substances, including human insulin and growth hormone. Many other substances not previously available in large quantities are now produced by biotechnological means. Some of these substances are useful in treating diseases. Those working on various genome (chromosomes with their associated genes) projects isolate genes and determine their function. This work continues to lead to the discovery of genes associated with specific diseases and inherited health risks, such as sickle cell anemia. Advances in biotechnology have created research opportunities in almost all areas of biology, with commercial applications in areas such as medicine, agriculture, and environmental remediation. Specialists Most biological scientists specialize in the study of a certain type of organism or in a specific activity, although recent advances have blurred some traditional classifications. * Geneticists study genetics, the science of genes, heredity, and variation of organisms. * Neuroscientists study the nervous system. * Developmental biologists study the process of development and growth of organisms * Biochemists study the chemical composition of living things. They analyze the complex chemical combinations and reactions involved in metabolism, reproduction, and growth. * Molecular biologists study the biological activity between biomolecules. * Microbiologists investigate the growth and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as bacteria, algae, or fungi. * Physiologists study life functions of plants and animals, in the whole organism and at the cellular or molecular level, under normal and abnormal conditions. Physiologists often specialize in functions such as growth, reproduction, photosynthesis, respiration, or movement, or in the physiology of a certain area or system of the organism. * Biophysicists use experimental methods traditionally employed in physics to answer biological questions . * Computational Biologists apply the techniques of computer science, applied mathematics and statistics to address biological problems. The main focus lies on developing mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques. By these means it addresses scientific research topics with their theoretical and experimental questions without a laboratory. * Zoologists and wildlife biologists study animals and wildlife‚Äîtheir origin, behavior, diseases, and life processes. Some experiment with live animals in controlled or natural surroundings, while others dissect dead animals to study their structure. Zoologists and wildlife biologists also may collect and analyze biological data to determine the environmental effects of current and potential uses of land and water areas. Zoologists usually are identified by the animal group they study. For example, ornithologists study birds, mammalogists study mammals, herpetologists study reptiles and amphibians, ichthyologists study fish, cnidariologists study jellyfishes and entomologists study insects. * Botanists study plants and their environments. Some study all aspects of plant life, including algae, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers, and flowering plants; others specialize in areas such as identification and classification of plants, the structure and function of plant parts, the biochemistry of plant processes, the causes and cures of plant diseases, the interaction of plants with other organisms and the environment, the geological record of plants and their evolution. Mycologists study fungi, such as yeasts, mold and mushrooms, which are a separate kingdom from plants. * Aquatic biologists study micro-organisms, plants, and animals living in water. Marine biologists study salt water organisms, and limnologists study fresh water organisms. Much of the work of marine biology centers on molecular biology, the study of the biochemical processes that take place inside living cells. Marine biology is a branch of oceanography, which is the study of the biological, chemical, geological, and physical characteristics of oceans and the ocean floor. (See the Handbook statements on environmental scientists and hydrologists and on geoscientists.) * Ecologists investigate the relationships among organisms and between organisms and their environments, examining the effects of population size, pollutants, rainfall, temperature, and altitude. Using knowledge of various scientific disciplines, ecologists may collect, study, and report data on the quality of air, food, soil, and water. * Evolutionary biologists investigate the evolutionary processes that produced the diversity of life on Earth, starting from a single common ancestor. These processes include natural selection, common descent, and speciation. Working conditions Biological scientists are not usually exposed to unsafe or unhealthy conditions. Those who work with dangerous organisms or toxic substances in the laboratory must follow strict safety procedures to avoid contamination. Many biological scientists, such as botanists, ecologists, and zoologists, conduct field studies that involve strenuous physical activity and primitive living conditions. Biological scientists in the field may work in warm or cold climates, in all kinds of weather. Marine biologists encounter a variety of working conditions. Some work in laboratories; others work on research ships, and those who work underwater must practice safe diving while working around sharp coral reefs and hazardous marine life. Although some marine biologists obtain their specimens from the sea, many still spend a good deal of their time in laboratories and offices, conducting tests, running experiments, recording results, and compiling data. Many biological scientists depend on grant money to fund their research. They may be under pressure to meet deadlines and to conform to rigid grant-writing specifications when preparing proposals to seek new or extended funding. Biological scientists typically work regular hours. While the 40-hour workweek is common, longer hours are not uncommon. Researchers may be required to work odd hours in laboratories or other locations (especially while in the field), depending on the nature of their research. Honors and awards The highest honor awarded to biologists is the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded since 1901, by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Another significant award is the Crafoord Prize in Biosciences; established in 1980.

Some of his speeches and articles made a big impression on his listeners; such as \\"Science as a Vocation\\" and \\"Politics as a Vocation\\" delivered at the University of Munich in late 1910s. Weber was a prolific speaker and lecturer, and delivered many speeches in his roles as an academic, politician, and German nationalist. Notable public speeches =Speech for the German National Committee (1 August 1916)= Chancellor von Bethmann Holweg founded the German National Committee to give the opposition to large scale annexation a voice. Right-wing groups were pushing the government to demand large conquests for Germany and a total defeat of the allies. They wanted no compromises towards the allies. Weber became a member of this Committee, which was powerless from the beginning, because the war goals were not discussable for this Committee. Weber broke the rule during his first speech in Nuremberg. He told his listeners that he was not a member of the Committee. He wanted the German politics to do what is just. The war shouldn't take an hour too long, because many people are suffering in the trenches. Weber openly declared to be against the unrestrained submarine war. Three lessons could be learned from the war. First is that money was a main reason why the war came into being. Secondly, industry and capitalists were very important for the war efforts. Thirdly, the state is more important than the nation, because the state rules over the life and death of its subjects. But when state and nation are combined, the state has more power. The poor results of Austria-Hungarian war efforts compared to Germany were an example of this. Germany fought this war to become a major power in Central Europe. Germany should responsible for an honourable treatment of the small nations in Central Europe and to prevent political subdual. He wanted the small nations to remain mainly politically independent, but German economy should be predominant. This way Germany could have a lasting result when it wins the war. =\\"Science as a Vocation\\" (1917)= =Speech in Munich (5 November 1917)= After hearing of the near collapse of Austria-Hungary, Weber advocated peace during a mass meeting in Munich. 'I don't speak as a scientist but as a politician. As a professor at a university, I have no special authority in politics, just like an admiral when he can't see the most important things, or a common worker. The threat of the 'Alldeutschen' is that they usually have the strongest influence on the government. The Alldeutschen are proud that they saw this war coming for a long time. They were not the only ones, but they were among the instigators of the war. They believed that politics should be made with a big mouth. The small efforts of German politics were achieved with a lot of noise; our enemies have achieved much more without noise. The Alldeutsche politics, for example, during the Boer War prevented our coming to an agreement with England. The hate against England was mainly directed towards the English constitution. 'For god sake no alliance with England, that would only bring us parliamentarianism'. This way domestic political motives became the basis for foreign policy or other any policy. Hand in hand with these fears of the English constitution was a worthless wooing of the Tsar's Russia, which brought us the hate of the Russian liberals and the despise of the autocratic ruler. The domestic political motives are responsible for this foreign policy, is proven by the submarine-agitation of the Alldeutschen. It began when the electoral reform was announced. Was this coincidence? In both questions we see the same enemies of Bethmann. From the moment that the submarine war was a political and diplomatic possibility, the prophecies came. The military leaders never joined the agitation, but they accepted it. They knew that the end of the prophecies would have more effect on morale than a peace resolution could. Together with the submarine war came the Mexico telegram. Who defended Zimmermann after this capital blunder? It was always the same group! Today they accuse the majority of the parliament of wanting a 'Hungerfrieden' (literally \\"hunger peace\\"). We should never accept a \\"hunger peace,\\" but if foreign countries think that we will accept a \\"hunger peace,\\" then this group is responsible for discrediting the policy of the parliament with the word \\"hunger peace.\\" The Alldeutschen want us to follow a politics of annexation without any consideration of our allies. The young emperor Charles of Austria- Hungary complained after the Russian revolution that he has nothing to say. Emperor Charles has a different opinion than Italy and Romania, who declared war on Germany, but an alliance between Austria and an Alldeutschen Germany would be very weak. The consideration of our allies was one of the most important reasons for the decision of the parliament on 19 July; today it can easily be said. The enemies of an agreement know that the parliamentary majority had to keep their motive secret; their agitation was therefore even more condemnable. The Alldeutschen, who call themselves Fatherland-party today --even the name is an infamy-- are affectionately pointing to the mood on the front. Our soldiers don't need the pacifists and the warmongers. They say: 'If politics was pragmatic instead of goddamned babble, then the war would stop when security had come for our fatherland!' They should ask the question about a peace agreement during a national referendum or a vote on the front! The bureaucratic system that ruled us until now has now come up with the appointment of Count Hertling (the new chancellor of Germany). We'll have to find out if he is a partyman or a statesman in domestic politics. But we welcome his appointment, because he responded to the papal proposition that he is in favour of a peace agreement. We welcome him also, because the strongest party in the parliament (the conservatives) can't deny responsibility anymore. We expect from Count Hertling, that he maintain a strong backbone against an irresponsible shadow government. Bismarck often complained about the interference of the military in politics. Our military leadership is brilliant; we have the full confidence in our military, but not when it comes to political questions. We expect that Count Hertling keep a strong connection between government and parliament, so that a failure of communication like 19 July can be prevented. When this connection between government and parliament exists, we don't need a controlling body like the Siebenerausschuss anymore, which is headed by Michaelis. We hope that Count Hertling will understand the need for democracy. This democracy will not agree to a shameful peace; our successors will not condone it. We want to conduct world politics, but only a Herrenvolk (nation of leaders) is capable of this. Not a Herrenvolk in the sense of the Alldeutschen idiocy, but just simply a nation that strongly controls its own administration. The Alldeutscher movement will only lead to a new de-politization of the nation. Like a free ripe nation, we want to enlist in the group of the Herrenvoelker of the earth.' =\\"Politics as a Vocation\\" (1919)= =Wirtschaftsgeschichte= References Weber * ","title":"Speeches of Max Weber"},{"id":"2537537","text":"Photon was a live action television show in the mid-1980s, which was tied into the Photon lasertag arenas and home game. It was produced by DIC Audiovisuel as a first run syndicated kids series which shown in various syndicated markets through most of the mid eighties. Animator Shinji Aramaki served as miniature model maker/designer on the special effects team for the series. Premise Photon followed the adventures of a young high school student, Christopher Jarvis with the alias of \\"Bhodi Li\\". Chris discovers that the lasertag game Photon is actually a way to detect the strongest warriors in the galaxy, who will then be recruited to fight the forces of darkness. After shooting his laser gun and saying \\"The light shines!\\", he would be transported to a space station to join his fellow Photon Warriors. His alien compatriots include an orphan earthling boy genius named Parcival, a shape-changing blob named Pike, a lizardoid named Leon, a cyborg named Lord Baethan, and Tivia, a black ninja princess from Nivia populated by women after the males became extinct. Their mentor is a sentient computer named MOM (Multiple Operation Matrix). The villains' motto is \\"Let the darkness grow!\\" The mission of each faction is to find the Photon crystal on each planet just as it nears the end of its hundred-year charge. If the Photon warriors are the first to shoot the crystal, the planet will be changed into a vital place full of life. If the villains do so, it will become a barren wasteland.

The aircraft also served with airlift and air mobility wings of the Air Force Reserve (AFRES), later renamed Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), the Air National Guard (ANG) and, later, one air mobility wing of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) dedicated to C-141, C-5, C-17 and KC-135 training. Introduced to replace slower propeller driven cargo planes such as the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II and Douglas C-133 Cargomaster, the C-141 was designed to requirements set in 1960 and first flew in 1963. Production deliveries of an eventual 285 planes began in 1965: 284 for the USAF, and a company demonstrator later delivered to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for use as an airborne observatory. The aircraft remained in service for over 40 years until the USAF withdrew the last C-141s from service in 2006, after replacing the airlifter with the C-17 Globemaster III. Development =Origins= Throughout the early 1960s, the United States Air Force's Military Air Transport Service (MATS) relied on a substantial number of propeller-driven aircraft for strategic airlift.Davis and Willson 2019, p. 74. As these aircraft were mostly obsolescent designs and the USAF needed the benefits of jet power, the USAF ordered 48 Boeing C-135 Stratolifters as an interim step. The C-135 was a useful stop-gap, but only had side-loading doors, thus much of the bulky and oversize equipment employed by the U.S. Army would not fit.Davis and Willson 2019, p. 150. During the spring of 1960, the USAF released Specific Operational Requirement 182, calling for a new aircraft that would be capable of performing both strategic and tactical airlift missions. The strategic role demanded that the aircraft be capable of missions with a radius of at least with a load. The tactical role required it to be able to perform low-altitude air drops of supplies, as well as carry and drop combat paratroops.Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, The Aviation Zone Several companies responded to SOR 182, including Boeing, Lockheed, and General Dynamics.Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, World Military Aircraft Early C-141As of 436th Airlift Wing, MAC, at Brisbane Airport, Australia, supporting the visit of President Lyndon B. Johnson, 22 October 1966. Lockheed's design team produced their own unique design in response to the requirement, internally designated as the Lockheed Model 300; it would be the first large jet designed from the start to carry freight. In comparison to the firm's previous utility transport, the turboprop-powered Lockheed C-130 Hercules, it was considerably bigger, as well as possessing greater speed and more power.Kirby 2011, p. 68. In terms of its basic configuration, the Model 300 was a large airlifter, furnished with a T-tail and a high-mounted swept wing, under which a total of four pod-mounted TF33 turbofan engines were fitted. The Model 300 possessed a lengthy, unobstructed cargo deck, which provided sufficient space and fittings to safely accommodate up to 154 troops or of cargo. During March 1961, Lockheed's submission was selected as the winner. President John F. Kennedy's first official act after his inauguration was to order the development of the Lockheed 300 on 13 March 1961, placing an initial contract for five aircraft for test and evaluation, to be designated the C-141. One unusual aspect of the aircraft was that it was designed to meet both military and civil airworthiness standards. The prototype C-141A serial number 61-2775 was manufactured and assembled in record time, having been rolled out of Lockheed's factory at Marietta, Georgia on 22 August 1963. It was also the first aircraft to be designed and produced at the plant that would go into full-rate production.Kirby 2011, p. 50. The prototype performed its maiden flight on 17 December of that year, coinciding with the 60th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first flight. In conjunction with the USAF, Lockheed subjected the prototype to an intensive flight testing programme, which would involve five testing and evaluation aircraft. The first delivery of a production C-141 occurred during April 1965. Over the course of three years, a total of 284 C-141s were manufactured, not including the five aircraft constructed solely for testing purposes. Production of new-build C-141s was terminated during February 1968. =Derivatives= During the 1960s, Lockheed had made efforts to market the aircraft on the civilian market; this resulted in provisional orders having been placed by both Flying Tiger Line and Slick Airways for four aircraft each. These were to be a stretched version, longer than the C-141A, which was marketed as the L-300 SuperstarLifter. Other changes were also incorporated to adapt the design to be more suited to the commercial sector, including the use of a different yoke. The development was not sustained and only the one civilian demonstration aircraft was built. When no commercial sales were made, Lockheed donated the aircraft to NASA.Kirby 2011, p. 74. Another, more ambitious proposal, commonly designated as SC.5/40, sought to combine elements of the Starlifter with another strategic airlifter, the turboprop-powered Short Belfast, was to be performed in partnership with the British aircraft manufacturer Shorts.Flight 19 September 1963, p. 508. For this variant, the fuselage of the Belfast would have been paired with the wing of the Starlifter, which would have readily enabled the adoption of turbojet engines; speculated engines to power the envisioned airlifter included the Pratt & Whitney JT3D-3 (18,000 lb) or JT3D-8 (21,000 lb), Rolls-Royce Conway 550 (21,825 lb) or Bristol Siddeley BS.100 (27,000 lb approximately).Wood 1975, p. 227. A broadly similar but improved proposal, designated as SC.5/45, was heavily promoted by Shorts for Operational Requirement ASR.364, partly on the basis that it would also enable a near-identical civil-orientated model to be produced for home and export use, designated as SC.5/41.Wood 1975, p. 231. Detailed presentations on the SC.5/41 and SC.5/45 proposals were reportedly made to both British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and to the Royal Air Force (RAF) respectively, but no orders were placed.Wood 1975, pp. 231‚Äì232. Design The Apollo 11 Mobile Quarantine Facility is unloaded from a C-141 at Ellington Air Force Base, 27 July 1969. The Lockheed C-141 Starlifter is a long range strategic airlifter, designed for transporting large quantities of either cargo or passengers. It is powered by an arrangement of four TF33 turbofan engines, each capable of generating up to of thrust; these were installed in pods beneath the high-mounted swept wing. The underside accommodates the retractable tricycle landing gear, consisting of a twin-wheel nose unit and four-wheel main units, the latter of which retract forward into fairings set onto each side of fuselage. The flight deck is typically operated by a crew of four. The use of a high-mounted wing enabled internal clearance in the cargo compartment of wide, high and long. Accordingly, the C-141 was capable of carrying, for example, a complete LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in its container; it was capable of carrying a maximum of over short distances, and carry up to when appropriately configured to carry the Minuteman, which lacked other equipment. In terms of personnel, the aircraft could carry a maximum of 154 fully-equipped troops, 123 paratroops or 80 litter patients at a time. In practice, it was discovered that under typical conditions, the cargo deck of the C-141A would run out of volume before the maximum weight value could be reached.Kirby 2011, p. 72. In terms of ground logistics, an important aspect of the C-141 was the floor height of the cabin being only above the ground, enabling easy access to the cabin via the large rear doors incorporated into the upwards-sweeping rear fuselage. This section is furnished with a large single-piece hydraulically- actuated loading ramp for simplified loading/unloading of both vehicles and general cargo. The two side-facing rear doors were designed to allow the type to be used for dropping paratroops (in August 1965, the C-141 performed the first such drop from a jet-powered aircraft). The rear cargo doors could be also opened in flight to perform airborne cargo drops. Operational history A C-141 in flight, circa 1984 The prototype and development aircraft were involved in an intensive operational testing programme, along with the first C-141 to be delivered to MATS (63-8078) on 19 October 1964 to the 1707th Air Transport Wing, Heavy (Training), Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma.C-141 Tail Number: 63-8078 USAFHRA Document 00495863 Following the satisfactory completion of civil testing, a Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) type certificate was awarded to the C-141 on 29 January 1965. The first delivery to an operational unit (63-8088) was conducted on 23 April 1965 to the 44th Air Transport Squadron, 1501st Air Transport Wing, Travis Air Force Base, California.C-141 Tail Number: 63-8088 Although operational testing was still underway, as a consequence of the United States' military involvement in South Vietnam, the C-141 was quickly dispatched to the region to commence operational sorties with the combat zone. The type became heavily used throughout the latter stages of the Vietnam War, its transport capabilities being in high demand.Kirby 2011, p. 76. Even following the arrival of large numbers of C-141s in the Vietnam theatre, the type was never able to fully replace the C-124 Globemaster II due to its inability to transport outsize equipment in-theatre; this situation was later addressed by the introduction of the even larger C-5 Galaxy.Davis and Willson 2019, p. 74.Kirby 2011, p. 78. The final duties performed by the C-141 in the conflict were repatriation flights, bringing home thousands of American prisoners of war(POWs).Kirby 2011, pp. 76-77. Despite some operational issues experienced, the C-141 formed the backbone of the USAF's strategic airlift capability during the late 1960s; it continued to hold this status through to the late 1990s.Kingsbury 2005, p. 20. On 8 January 1966, following the disestablishment of MATS, all C-141s were transferred to the newly established Military Airlift Command (MAC).Davis and Willson 2019, p. 79. During October 1973, both the C-141 and the larger C-5 Galaxy airlifted supplies from the United States to Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War as part of Operation Nickel Grass. Over the course of the operation, C-141s flew 422 missions and carried a total of 10,754 tons of cargo.\\"Operation Nickel Grass.\\"Air Mobility Command Museum. Retrieved: 23 August 2014. By 1975, the C-141 fleet have reportedly accumulated an average of 20,000 flight hours each, two-thirds of their original rated life span. A C-141 participating in Operation Deep Freeze, October 1997 Despite an early belief that the advantages of the turbojet over preceding propeller-driven cargo aircraft would render the latter obsolete, service experiences with the C-141 found that there was still a useful role for turboprop-driven utility transports such as the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Capabilities such as short- field takeoff performance and suitability for austere airstrips meant that such aircraft proved useful, while the C-141 proved to be anything but robust, suffering numerous instances of structural failures.Ziman 2003, p. 298. Specifically, the C-141 fleet was troubled by seemingly random cracking through the wing area, which was, according to a report compiled by the Government Accountability Office (GOA), sometimes attributable to stresses imposed under certain types of missions undertaken. A planned remedial programme during the 1980s to repair wing boxes uncovered significant corrosion and cracking, necessitating the full replacement of the wing boxes across the fleet instead of making repairs.Kingsbury 2005, pp. 20, 23. During the late 1970s, the USAF opted to commence a series of major upgrades to the C-141 fleet; not only was work started on a life extension programme but, in 1977, the service also accepted a proposal from Lockheed to stretch several aircraft. The first of these stretched airlifters, re-designated C-141B to differentiate it from unmodified members of the fleet, was delivered during December 1979. The final C-141B was delivered in 1982. A total of 270 C-141As were modified to the C-141B standard, comprising nearly the entire original production run.Kirby 2011, p. 75. The first strategic airlift flight of Operation Desert Shield was flown by a MAC C-141 of the 437th Military Airlift Wing out of Charleston AFB, SC, on 7 August 1990. The C-141 proved to be a workhorse airlifter of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, flying of cargo and 93,126 passengers during 8,536 airlift missions.Matthews and Holt 1992, pp. 37‚Äì40. In order to provide sufficient C-141s to meet intense demands, all scheduled maintenance activities were postponed, while the planned peacetime flight hours of the fleet were doubled. According to a GAO report, weight-related operational restrictions imposed upon the fleet have little affect on performance overall. This airlift effort has been referred to as the largest in history.Kingsbury 2005, p. 3. On 1 June 1992, following the disestablishment of Military Airlift Command, all C-141s and the airlift wings to which they were assigned were transferred to the newly established Air Mobility Command (AMC). Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) C-141s and units were also transferred to AMC. By 1992, shortly following the end of Desert Storm, according to a GAO report, the C-141 fleet had, on average, nearly reached its 30,000 rated service life.Kingsbury 2005, p. 35. While the USAF was in the process of putting the fleet through a life extension programme, numerous aircraft had reached well into their extended service life already, necessitating large numbers of C-141s to be withdrawn accompanied by tight limitations on the remaining fleet's flying hours being implemented during the 1990s. The GOA warned that, should another event on the scale of Desert Storm break out, the USAF would probably experience a significant shortage in airlift capabilities due to the high fatigue state of the fleet, and noted that the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III intended to eventually replace the C-141 was experiencing delays.Kingsbury 2005, pp. 3-5, 35. Hanoi Taxi flying over the National Museum of the United States Air Force in December 2005. During 1994, one of the aircraft based at Wright-Patterson AFB was identified by its crew chief as the Hanoi Taxi (AF Serial Number 66-0177), the first aircraft to land in North Vietnam in 1973 for Operation Homecoming in the final days of the Vietnam War, to repatriate American POWs from North Vietnam.Kirby 2011, p. 77. Between 1996 and 1998, a C-141A was used as a towing aircraft in the Eclipse project to demonstrate the possibility of using aerotow systems to bring towed winged vehicles to sufficient altitude to launch small satellites, the ultimate goal was to lower the cost of space launches. Six successful tests were flown with a modified Convair F-106 Delta Dart, the QF-106 variant, in tow. A similar system can be seen in SpaceShipTwo, whereby atmospheric engines carry a rocket-engined \\"second stage\\" to high altitude for launch. On 16 September 2004, the C-141 left service with all active USAF units, being confined to Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units for the final two years of its operational service life. Between 2004 and 2006, multiple C-141s assigned to the Air Force Reserve's 445th Airlift Wing (445 AW) at Wright-Patterson AFB were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, where they were typically engaged in the medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) mission to repatriate wounded service members. In 2005, Hanoi Taxi and other aircraft were marshalled by the USAF to provide evacuation for those seeking refuge from Hurricane Katrina. This aircraft and others evacuated thousands of people, including the MEDIVAC of hundreds of ill and injured. With the 5 May 2005 announcement of the retirement of the last eight C-141s, the Hanoi Taxi embarked on a series of flights, giving veterans, some of whom flew out of POW captivity in Vietnam in this aircraft, the opportunity to experience one more flight before retirement. On 6 May 2006, the Hanoi Taxi landed for the last time and was received in a formal retirement ceremony at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio.\\"LOCKHEED C-141C STARLIFTER 'HANOI TAXI'.\\"National Museum of the United States Air Force. Retrieved: 28 November 2012. 15 C-141s, including the \\"Hanoi Taxi\\", are now on static display at various air museums around the United States, all other airframes were retired to the \\"boneyard\\" at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, where they were scrapped.AMARC Experience - Search the Database Variants =C-141A= Cockpit of early C-141 on display at McChord AFB The original Starlifter model, designated C-141A, could carry 154 passengers, 123 paratroopers or 80 litters for wounded with seating for 16. A total of 284 A-models were built. The C-141A entered service in April 1965. It was soon discovered that the aircraft's volume capacity was relatively low in comparison to its lifting capacity; it generally ran out of physical space before it hit its weight limit.Donald, David, ed. \\"Lockheed C-141 StarLifter\\". The Complete Encyclopedia of World Aircraft. Barnes & Nobel Books, 1997. . The C-141A could carry ten standard 463L master pallets and had a total cargo capacity of . It could also carry specialized cargoes, such as the Minuteman missile. NASA obtained Lockheed's C-141 demonstrator, designated L-300.Lockheed L-300-50A-01A Brief History of the KAO The airplane was modified to house the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) telescope for use at very high altitudes. This aircraft, NC-141A is in storage at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Federal Airfield, California. The KAO was retired in 1995 and was replaced by the 747SP-based Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). =C-141B= A lengthened C-141B in front of a C-141A In service, the C-141 proved to \\"bulk out\\" before it \\"grossed out\\", meaning that it often had additional lift capacity that went wasted because the cargo hold was full before the plane's weight capacity had been reached. To correct the perceived deficiencies of the original model and utilize the C-141 to the fullest of its capabilities, 270 in-service C-141As (vast majority of the fleet) were stretched, adding needed payload volume. The conversion program took place between 1977 and 1982, with first delivery taking place in December 1979. These modified aircraft were designated C-141B. It was estimated that this stretching program was equivalent to buying 90 new aircraft, in terms of increased capacity. Also added was a boom receptacle for inflight refueling. The fuselage was stretched by adding \\"plug\\" sections forward and aft of the wings, lengthening the fuselage a total of and allowing the carriage of 103 litters for wounded, 13 standard pallets, 205 troops, 168 paratroopers, or an equivalent increase in other loads. SOLL II In 1994, a total of 13 C-141Bs were given SOLL II (Special Operations Low-Level II) modifications, which gave the aircraft a low-level night flying capability, enhanced navigation equipment, and improved defensive countermeasures. These aircraft were operated by AMC in conjunction with Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). Upgraded glass cockpit of the C-141C variant =C-141C= A total of 63 C-141s were upgraded throughout the 1990s to C-141C configuration, with improved avionics and navigation systems, to keep them up to date. New capabilities, including traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) and Global Positioning System (GPS), were added to aircraft that received this upgrade package. This variant introduced some of the first glass cockpit technology to the aircraft, as well as improving reliability by replacing some mechanical and electromechanical components with more modern electronic equivalents. The final C-141C were delivered during late 2001.

Unfortunately, this account is probably not trustworthy, as it was recorded nearly 800 years after her death. No other contemporary sources about her or her life have survived. Life The Well of St. Keyne; by Thomas Creswick Keyne was one of the 12 daughters of the Welsh king King Brychan of Brycheiniog in what is now South Wales (A different source, De Situ Brecheniauc, says that he actually had 24 daughters, all of whom were saints). Although she was a great beauty and received many offers of marriage, Keyne took a vow of virginity and pursued a religious life (hence her Welsh name, Cain Wyry, or Keyne the Maiden). Her vita reports that she traveled widely, and is said to have founded several oratories, including Llangeinor in mid Glamorgan, Llangunnor and Llangain in Dyfed, and Rockfield (Llangennon) in Runston, Gwent. Eventually she is said to have crossed the Severn into Cornwall, where she resided as a hermitess for many years. The village of St Keyne in Cornwall, is named after her, and is the site of a church and a holy well which also takes her name. Plaque at St Keyne's well Around 490, she is alleged to have visited her nephew Saint Cadoc at St Michael's Mount. Cadoc persuaded her to return to Wales, and healing spring marked the location where she settled and eventually died. She died a virgin on 5 October in either 490 or 505. Llangeinor in Glamorgan has been proposed as a likely spot, as an ancient well is situated there, which is still said to have healing properties. Legacy Saint Keyne's feast is celebrated on 8 October, although it is also recorded as 30 September. She was the original patron saint of what is now St Martin-by-Looe (Penndrumm) and is linked with the River Kenwyn in Truro. However, her most enduring and romanticized legacy is linked to the holy well that takes its name from her, located in St Keyne, Cornwall. According to legend, whichever partner in a marriage drinks from the well first will have the upper hand in the marriage, and rule over the other. This story was known in the Middle Ages, and was memorialized in Robert Southey's poem \\"The Well of St Keyne.\\"\\"The Well of St. Keyne\\", Poemhunter Some sources credit her as the patron saint of Keynsham in Somerset, where she is said to resided near the banks of the Avon, which was swarming with serpents and uninhabitable. After Saint Keyne issued a fervent prayer, the serpents were transformed to stone, and the area became habitable. (Today, these are considered to be the fossilized remains of ammonites). However, a similar miracle is also attributed to St. Hilda, and it has been suggested that Keynsham instead takes its name from \\"Ceagin's (Caega) Hamm.\\" Interpretations The Edwardian scholar G.H. Doble found it hard to accept that a woman could have traveled so far or founded so many settlements, and therefore she \\"quite may well have been a man.\\" He believed that the journeyings were more in character with male saints from this period, a sentiment which was shared by the scholar Alban Butler, who believed a number of female saints had actually been men. This view has been challenged by scholars such as Jane Cartwright, who states that this is indicative of a school of thought in which male saints are much more likely to be real historical figures than female saints, and that maleness alone is greater evidence of historicity than femaleness. St. Keyne's well The holy well of Saint Keyne is located about southeast of St. Keyne's Church in Cornwall, and is now in a small housing made of dressed granite. The original housing was built in the 16th century, it was rebuilt in 1936 after the adjoining lane was widened. The plaque next to the well describes the spell which Saint Keyne is said to have cast upon the water of the well. The plaque reads: \\"The legend of Saint Keyne Well. Saint Keyne was a princess who lived about 600 AD. She laid on the waters of this well a spell thus described by Richard Carew in 1602 AD‚Äî'The quality that man or wife / Whom chance or choice attaines / First of this sacred stream to drinke / Thereby the mastery gains.'\\" In Victorian times the well had the reputation of conferring supremacy to the marriage partner who first tasted it. There is also a ballad called The Well of St Keyne written by Robert Southey; it is set to an adaptation of the air of the Helston Furry Dance.MacMahon, Desmond (1939) Nelson's New National and Folk Song Book; pt.

Along with former NBA player Tom Tolbert, Barbieri hosted the afternoon sports radio show The Razor and Mr. T on KNBR from 1996 to 2012. With Barbieri, the show was the highest-rated show in the Bay Area for the 25‚Äì54 male demographic since 2000. Early life and education Barbieri was born in San Francisco to Louis J. and Gloria Barbieri. He grew up in Millbrae, California. Barbieri earned a bachelor's degree in 1967 from the University of San Francisco, having studied political science with a minor in philosophy. He proceeded to obtain Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. After completing his studies, he spent one-and-a-half years in New York, where he found employment in advertising. He subsequently returned to San Francisco. Career Barbieri was a stringer for Sport magazine before he joined KNBR in 1984 at the sports news desk. He was later given his own sports talk show and transferred to the prime afternoon-time slot. In 1996, he was teamed with Tolbert, a former NBA player. Barbieri's nickname was \\"The Razor\\" because of his raspy voice, thought by some listeners to resemble a barber's electric razor, and his \\"no-nonsense\\" approach to interviews. The nickname, which may have also been inspired by his surname's resemblance to \\"barber\\", was given to him by longtime San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen. He was described as a \\"bulldog of an interviewer\\" who exuded an \\"opinionated\\" and \\"abrasive\\" interviewing style. At the same time, his critics took the view that his questions were long-winded and restrained, which he said enabled listeners to get a better grasp of the people he was interviewing. In 2007, Barbieri renewed his four-year contract with KNBR through November 2011. Barbieri was known to end his show with, \\"Angels fly because they take themselves lightly\\", a quote from G. K. Chesterton. On April 11, 2012, the 66-year-old Barbieri was let go by KNBR. KNBR's parent company, Cumulus Media, said he \\"refused to honor some of the most basic terms of his contract.\\" Barbieri's legal team cited age discrimination and disability discrimination in the termination. Earlier in 2011, Barbieri had revealed that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2005. In 2013 local media sources reported that Barbieri had accepted a $4 million settlement from Cumulus. Personal life Barbieri was a vegetarian, a believer in animal rights and a follower of eastern religious philosophies. In 1995, he avoided jail time by pleading no contest to a third- offense drunk driving charge; he spent 120 days in a residential treatment program. Following the incident, Barbieri settled down, giving up what he called \\"25 years of sex, drugs and rock and roll.\\" In 2000, Barbieri fathered a son, Tayte Ali, via in-vitro fertilization, using an egg donor and a surrogate mother. In 2004, the American Diabetes Association named Ralph Barbieri one of five \\"Bay Area Father of the Year\\" award winners. Barbieri died on August 3, 2020, at his home in Novato, California. He was 74, and suffered from Parkinson's disease since he was diagnosed in 2005.

The Academy team was made up of players aged around 20, who are all with the South African National Cricket Academy as trainees. Only one - Jean-Paul Duminy - had any international experience from before, having toured Sri Lanka in 2004. The Pakistan Academy, meanwhile, consisted of a similarly young team, with one player having Test experience. There were two four-day matches and three one-day matches scheduled. The four- day matches did not have first class status, nor did the one-day matches have List A status. The Academy teams are not to be confused with A teams, which are second-tier teams, while these seem to have their focus on youth cricket. Pakistan Academy dominated the series, only losing the final match, when the one-day series was already decided. They won the four-day series 1-0 and the one-day series 2-1\\\\.  Squads  * South Africa: Francois du Plessis (captain), Brendon Adams, Ryan Canning, Jandre Coetzee, Jean-Paul Duminy, Ugasen Govender, Morn√© Morkel, Francis Nkuna, Mario Olivier, Aaron Phangiso, Vernon Philander, Thandi Tshabalala, Kyle Smit, Vaughn van Jaarsveld, Myles Williamson. * Pakistan: Hasan Raza (captain), Aamer Sajjad, Agha Sabir, Fahad Masood, Fawad Alam (OD only), Jannisar Khan, Khalid Latif, Khurram Manzoor, Mansoor Amjad, Mohammad Irshad, Najaf Shah, Nasir Jamshed, Rizwan Akbar (OD only), Shahid Yousuf, Tahir Khan, Tariq Mahmood, Yasir Ali, Zulqarnain Haider  Match details  = First 4-day match, Pakistan Academy v South Africa Academy (11‚Äì13 August) = Pakistan Academy won by nine wickets After the first two days at National Stadium were closely fought, the tourists imploded to hand Pakistan the victory and a 1-0 lead in the 2-match series. It had started well for South Africa, which Myles Williamson - without any first- class experience - making 31, while Thandi Tshabalala and Jean-Paul Duminy made fifties. At 174 for 3, South Africa looked confident, but Pakistan fought back. Yasir Ali ripped through the lower order with six wickets, all caught behind, lbw or bowled, as South Africa were all out for 248, Duminy left stranded on 82 not out. South Africa's fielding effort started well, with Ugasen Govender taking three wickets as Pakistan crawled to 84 for 5, but thanks to 19-year-old Zulqarnain Haider, who made 76, the innings was turned around. South Africa still led by 12 after the first innings, which was completed eight overs into day three, but Yasir continued with his good bowling, and wicket-keeper Zulqarnain held four catches as South Africa crawled to 118 - Vaughn van Jaarsveld the only batsman to pass 20 with his 46. Pakistan were set 131 to win, and did it with ease, Shahid Yousuf scoring 83 not out as they passed the target with nine wickets to spare. Cricketarchive scorecard = Second 4-day match, Pakistan Academy v South Africa Academy (18‚Äì21 August) = Match drawn Despite declaring twice in an attempt to get a result, the South African team was very nearly beaten in this match at Gaddafi Stadium. Having won the toss and chosen to bat, they immediately lost two wickets to their tormentor, Yasir Ali, and at 121 for 5 things looked grim. However, Jean-Paul Duminy played what is possibly his highest innings of his career, flaying the Pakistani bowlers for an incredible 265 not out - well supported by Ryan Canning, who notched up 112 runs before captain Francois du Plessis declared. With the total 470 for 5 - the partnership having added 349 runs together - South Africa managed to dig into the Pakistani batsmen at regular intervals on day three, and despite 85 from Shahid Yousuf they could only post 303. Ugasen Govender and Vernon Philander both got figures of three wickets for 43. In reply, South Africa made hay quickly, scoring 162 for 5 in 34 overs and giving themselves plenty of time to bowl Pakistan out - setting them what was thought to be a challenging target of 330. However, despite four wickets from Morn√© Morkel, Shahid Yousuf and Hasan Raza made centuries, and when the final over of the day was bowled, the hosts needed 13 runs to complete the whitewash and win the series 2-0. They could only make six - however, they still took the series, with 1-0 in two Tests. Cricketarchive scorecard = First 1-day match, Pakistan Academy v South Africa Academy (24 August) = Pakistan Academy won by 84 runs Pakistan Academy continued their good run, winning the first of three one-day games. In these games, 12 players could be named, but only 11 could bat, meaning that a team could choose to pick one player to only bowl. Hasan Raza, coming off an unbeaten century in the four-day game, continued to impress, hitting a well-paced 70 as Pakistan Academy made their way to 244 for 8. The South African reply was stopped dead by pacer Mohammad Irshad, who took six for 21 as the South Africans collapsed to 160. Irshad's first two wickets were number two Coetzee and number three Smit, both bowled for 0 and 2 respectively. Cricketarchive scorecard = Second 1-day match, Pakistan Academy v South Africa Academy (26 August) = Pakistan Academy won by 39 runs Pakistan Academy secured the series with a 39-run win at the Gaddafi Stadium, going up 2-0 in the three-game series. Having been put in to bat by the South African captain, the Pakistani openers Agha Sabir and Khurram Manzoor added 140 for the first wicket. Despite three wickets from Mario Olivier, and two run outs, Pakistan still managed 280 before being bowled out nine balls short of the 50 over limit. South Africa got off to a poor start when Irshad had Williamson bowled for a two-ball duck in the first over, but Francois du Plessis and Ryan Canning put them back on track with a fine fifth-wicket partnership worth 80. When that partnership was broken, however, the tourists collapsed, ending on 241 all out. Cricketarchive scorecard = Third 1-day match, Pakistan Academy v South Africa (28 August) = South Africa Academy won by 4 runs (D/L method) In a match reduced by rain, the South African Academy came back to record their first victory of the tour in the final game. Winning the toss and opting to bat at the Sheikhupura Stadium in Lahore, they lost Tshabalala early, but Williamson and Smit sent them back on track with a 61-run partnership. The middle and lower order then smacked the bowlers about, van Jaarsveld and Phangiso hitting three sixes between them in quickfire innings, as South Africa closed on 164 for 9. Mansoor Amjad took four wickets for Pakistan, but conceded 57 runs from five overs in the process. Due to rain having interrupted South Africa's innings, Pakistan were set 176 to win, and were in trouble early as Philander and Govender took wickets to peg them back to 12 for 3. Hasan Raza made another big innings, with 67 not out, but could not hit quickly enough as Pakistan fell five runs short of the target, ending on 171 for 5.

It is northeast of Fintona and southeast of Omagh. The village had a population of 162 in the 2001 Census.  Geography  The name Seskinore is derived from the Irish Seisceann Mh√≥r, which means \\"big marsh/bog\\", and the area to the north on the way to Omagh is characterised by lowland raised bog. Pike's Province of Ulster (1909) described the area thus: \\"The country is undulating with bogs in parts which make hunting difficult\\".Seskinore Hunt Seskinore Forest, north of the village, is a mixed broadleaf and coniferous woodland which dates from at least 1833.  History  Little is known about the origins of the village but there is proof that it existed in the early part of the 17th century when at least two of its inhabitants were listed as paying Hearth Tax. Following the marriage of Mary Perry to Alexander McClintock in 1781, the village became the family seat of the McClintock family, who had settled in Ulster in 1597 from Argyll, Scotland. The McClintock family were enthusiastic huntsmen and in 1860 they established the \\"Tyrone Hunt\\", which was renamed the \\"Seskinore Hunt\\" in 1886.  Schools  The village has one primary school, McClintock Primary School, which is at the south end of the Main Street on land donated by Lt. Col. John Knox McClintock. Building of the school began in 1900 and it opened in 1902. It was originally known as Seskinore No.2 National School as there was also at one time a Chapel School.  Churches  Even though it is a small village, Seskinore has three churches: * Seskinore Parish Church (Church of Ireland) also known as the Chapel of Ease Previously a school house on the McClintock Estate, situated at the junction of the Beragh and Omagh Roads, served as a place of worship for members of the Church of Ireland in the Seskinore area for the greater part of the 19th Century. In 1890 the McClintock family build the present Chapel of Ease. The church has a fine picturesque woodland setting and was built as a Chapel of Ease to the Parish Church at Clogherny. * Seskinore Presbyterian Church The church holds the distinction of being the oldest religious edifice in the village having been built c. 1827. The congregation here was called Newtownparry after the original name of the village. The General Assembly in 1898 granted a request that the name be changed to Seskinore Presbyterian Church. * St. Malachy's Church (Catholic) The Catholic Church in the village was originally a dwelling house which was purchased, in 1839, by the Catholic Community and was enlarged and fitted out as a place of worship. Extensive repairs were carried out c.1906 and it has remained substantially unchanged since.

It was invented by Bernard Tavitian and first released in 2000 by Sekko√Øa, a French company. It has won several awards, including the Mensa Select award and the 2004 Teacher's Choice Award. In 2009, the game was sold to Mattel. Gameplay The shapes of the 21 Blokus tiles. The game is played on a square board divided into 20 rows and 20 columns, for a total of 400 squares. There are a total of 84 game tiles, organized into 21 shapes in each of four colors: blue, yellow, red and green. The 21 shapes are based on free polyominoes of from one to five squares (one monomino, one domino, two trominoes/triominoes, five tetrominoes, and 12 pentominoes). The standard rules of play for all variations of the game are as follows: *Order of play is based on the color of pieces: blue, yellow, red, green. *The first piece played of each color is placed in one of the board's four corners. Each new piece played must be placed so that it touches at least one piece of the same color, with only corner-to-corner contact allowed‚Äîedges cannot touch. However, edge-to-edge contact is allowed when two pieces of different color are involved. *When a player cannot place a piece, he or she passes, and play continues as normal. The game ends when no one can place a piece. When a game ends, each player counts every square that he/she did NOT place on the board, each counting as a negative (-1) point (e.g. a tetromino is worth -4 points). The player with the highest score wins. A player who played all of his or her pieces is awarded a +20 point bonus if the last piece played was a monomino, or a +15 point bonus for any other piece. Two and three player variations Blokus rules allow for two and three player games also. In two-player games, each player takes two colors. In three-player games, either one of the players takes two colors or else \\"the pieces of the fourth color are placed on the board in a non-strategic way.\\" Expansions and spinoffs Blokus Duo Sekko√Øa and its distributors manufacture four additional versions of the game. =Blokus Duo/Travel Blokus= Blokus Duo is for two players only, and uses a smaller (14√ó14) board; the piece colors are purple and orange. The two starting squares are placed, not in the corner (as in the original Blokus game) but nearer to the centre. This makes a crucial difference in the flavour of the game, because players' pieces may (and usually do) touch after the first move. Even more than with the original game, Blokus Duo is an offence- centred game; it is also a much purer strategy game than the four-player game, since one is not in danger of getting ganged up on by three other players (as sometimes happens with the four-player version). =Blokus Trigon= Blokus Trigon Blokus Trigon uses pieces made up of triangles rather than squares (polyiamonds), and is played on a hexagonal board, a version optimized for three players but can be played with 2, 3, or 4 players. The same rules apply, meaning that 2 edges cannot touch; however, as it is isometric, a corner touching an edge is allowed. =Blokus Giant= Blokus Giant is a larger version, with the game board being about square. =Blokus Junior= Blokus Junior is targeted at younger children. Like Blokus Duo, it is played by two players on a 14√ó14 board but it uses only a subset of the pieces that have a supposedly simpler shape. There are 12 unique pieces. Each player gets two of each kind, 24 in total. The game also comes with a set of sheets with single- player puzzles, which show positions in which the player needs to connect two pieces following standard Blokus rules. =Rumis/Blokus 3D= Blokus 3D Blokus 3D, originally marketed in a Mayan theme as Rumis, uses pieces made up of unit cubes, in every permutation of three and four cubes in three dimensions. Stefan K√∂gl created Rumis independently from Bernard Tavitian, and is thus not related. However, Rumis was rebranded into Blokus 3D since the Blokus brand proved stronger than Rumis. There is also a major rule change; instead of being required to place pieces so they touch corner-to-corner, a piece must be placed such that it touches a face of another piece of the same color. Also, a player placing a piece cannot do so if it would create any empty space underneath any part of the piece. The object is to build one of four different structures, each with its own placement limitations: the Tower, Wall, Steps, and Pyramid. Players attempt to place their blocks such that at the end of the game, when the structure is viewed from above, their color has the most squares showing. Video games Funkitron developed a PC casual game version of Blokus called Blokus World Tour. Released in December 2007, Blokus World Tour was similar to the board game version of Blokus, but also featured 16 AI opponents, music and sound effects, and multiple game modes, including a tour mode, quick play, and Blokus Challenges. For some time, there was an official online version of Blokus where visitors could play with opponents all over the world. Mattel suspended the online game on May 18, 2012, stating it did not meet its playability standards.blokus.com. Retrieved 2012-07-25. It is now possible to play blokus online at Pentolla.com.Pentolla homepage pentolla.com The PlayStation Portable has Blokus Portable: Steambot Championship, which features characters from Steambot Chronicles playing the Classic, Travel, and Duo versions of the game. A Gameloft developed version of Blokus was released for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad in April 2010, featuring the Classic and Duo versions of the game, local and online multiplayer gameplay, and single player tournament mode. A clone named Quadrus, is available since January 2014. As of January 2014, the Gameloft version of Blokus is no longer available from the App Store. Currently, the officially licensed Blokus app is developed by Magmic, and is available for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. This version includes solo play and multiplayer options, integrating the user's Facebook and Game Center friends and allowing them to compete on a tournament leader- board.

Because these glands often act in concert, physiologists and endocrinologists find it convenient and descriptive to speak of them as a single system. The HPG axis plays a critical part in the development and regulation of a number of the body's systems, such as the reproductive and immune systems. Fluctuations in this axis cause changes in the hormones produced by each gland and have various local and systemic effects on the body. The axis controls development, reproduction, and aging in animals. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is secreted from the hypothalamus by GnRH-expressing neurons. The anterior portion of the pituitary gland produces luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and the gonads produce estrogen and testosterone. In oviparous organisms (e.g. fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds), the HPG axis is commonly referred to as the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal-liver axis (HPGL-axis) in females. Many egg-yolk and chorionic proteins are synthesized heterologously in the liver, which are necessary for ovocyte growth and development. Examples of such necessary liver proteins are vitellogenin and choriogenin. The HPA, HPG, and HPT axes are three pathways in which the hypothalamus and pituitary direct neuroendocrine function.  Location and regulation  HPG regulation in males, with the inhibin/activin system playing a similar role on GnRH- producing cells. The hypothalamus is located in the brain and secretes GnRH. GnRH travels down the anterior portion of the pituitary via the hypophyseal portal system and binds to receptors on the secretory cells of the adenohypophysis. In response to GnRH stimulation these cells produce LH and FSH, which travel into the blood stream. These two hormones play an important role in communicating to the gonads. In females FSH and LH act primarily to activate the ovaries to produce estrogen and inhibin and to regulate the menstrual cycle and ovarian cycle. Estrogen forms a negative feedback loop by inhibiting the production of GnRH in the hypothalamus. Inhibin acts to inhibit activin, which is a peripherally produced hormone that positively stimulates GnRH-producing cells. Follistatin, which is also produced in all body tissue, inhibits activin and gives the rest of the body more control over the axis. In males LH stimulates the interstitial cells located in the testes to produce testosterone, and FSH plays a role in spermatogenesis. Only small amounts of estrogen are secreted in males. Recent research has shown that a neurosteroid axis exists, which helps the cortex to regulate the hypothalamus's production of GnRH. In addition, leptin and insulin have stimulatory effects and ghrelin has inhibitory effects on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus. Kisspeptin also influences GnRH secretion.  Function  = Reproduction = One of the most important functions of the HPG axis is to regulate reproduction by controlling the uterine and ovarian cycles. In females, the positive feedback loop between estrogen and luteinizing hormone help to prepare the follicle in the ovary and the uterus for ovulation and implantation. When the egg is released, the empty follicle sac begins to produce progesterone to inhibit the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary thus stopping the estrogen-LH positive feedback loop. If conception occurs, the placenta will take over the secretion of progesterone; therefore the mother cannot ovulate again. If conception does not occur, decreasing excretion of progesterone will allow the hypothalamus to restart secretion of GnRH. These hormone levels also control the uterine (menstrual) cycle causing the proliferation phase in preparation for ovulation, the secretory phase after ovulation, and menstruation when conception does not occur. The activation of the HPG axis in both males and females during puberty also causes individuals to acquire secondary sex characteristics. In males, the production of GnRH, LH, and FSH are similar, but the effects of these hormones are different. FSH stimulates sustentacular cells to release androgen-binding protein, which promotes testosterone binding. LH binds to the interstitial cells, causing them to secrete testosterone. Testosterone is required for normal spermatogenesis and inhibits the hypothalamus. Inhibin is produced by the spermatogenic cells, which, also through inactivating activin, inhibits the hypothalamus. After puberty these hormones levels remain relatively constant. = Life cycle = The activation and deactivation of the HPG axis also helps to regulate life cycles. At birth FSH and LH levels are elevated, and females also have a lifetime supply of primary oocytes. These levels decrease and remain low through childhood. During puberty the HPG axis is activated by the secretions of estrogen from the ovaries or testosterone from the testes. This activation of estrogen and testosterone causes physiological and psychological changes. Once activated, the HPG axis continues to function in men for the rest of their life but becomes deregulated in women, leading to menopause. This deregulation is caused mainly by the lack of oocytes that normally produce estrogen to create the positive feedback loop. Over several years, the activity the HPG axis decreases and women are no longer fertile. Although males remain fertile until death, the activity of the HPG axis decreases. As males age, the testes begin to produce less testosterone, leading to a condition known as post-pubertal hypogonadism. The cause of the decreased testosterone is unclear and a current topic of research. Post- pubertal hypogonadism results in progressive muscle mass decrease, increase in visceral fat mass, loss of libido, impotence, decreased attention, increased risk of fractures, and abnormal sperm production. = Sexual dimorphism and behavior = Sex steroids also affect behavior, because sex steroids affect the brains structure and functioning. During development, hormones help determine how neurons synapse and migrate to result in sexual dimorphisms. These physical differences lead to differences in behavior. While GnRH has not been shown to have any direct influence on regulating brain structure and function, gonadotropins, sex steroids, and activin have been shown to have such effects. It is thought that FSH may have an important role in brain development and differentiation. Testosterone levels have been shown to relate to prosocial behavior. This helps create synaptogenesis by promoting neurite development and migration. Activin promotes neural plasticity throughout the lifespan and regulates the neurotransmitters of peripheral neurons. Environment can also affect hormones and behavior interaction. Women have more connections between areas of language better enabling them to communicate than men. On average men outperform women on spatial reasoning tests, which is theorized to result from sexual differences. Testosterone has been linked to aggression and sex drive; therefore men tend to be more competitive or aggressive than women. There is also a large amount of individual diversity within all these traits and hormone levels.  Clinical relevance  =Disorders= Disorders of the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis are classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as:Page 54 in: *WHO group I of ovulation disorders: Hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary failure *WHO group II of ovulation disorders: Hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary dysfunction. WHO group II is the most common cause of ovulation disorders, and the most common causative member is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  Gene mutations  Genetic mutations and chromosomal abnormalities are two sources of HPG axis alteration. Single mutations usually lead to changes in binding ability of the hormone and receptor leading to inactivation or over activation. These mutations can occur in the genes coding for GnRH, LH, and FSH or their receptors. Depending on which hormone and receptor are unable to bind different effects occur but all alter the HPG axis. For example, the male mutation of the GnRH coding gene could result in hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. A mutation that cause a gain of function for LH receptor can result in a condition known as testotoxicosis, which cause puberty to occur between ages 2‚Äì3 years. Loss of function of LH receptors can cause male pseudohermaphroditism. In females mutations would have analogous effects. Hormone replacement can be used to initiate puberty and continue if the gene mutation occurs in the gene coding for the hormone. Chromosomal mutations tend to affect the androgen production rather than the HPG axis. = Suppression = The HPG axis can be suppressed by hormonal birth control administration. Although often described as preventing pregnancy by mimicking the pregnancy state, hormonal birth control is effective because it works on the HPG axis to mimic the luteal phase of a woman's cycle. The primary active ingredients are synthetic progestins, which mimic biologically derived progesterone. The synthetic progestin prevents the hypothalamus from releasing GnRH and the pituitary from releasing LH and FSH; therefore it prevents the ovarian cycle from entering the menstrual phase and prevents follicle development and ovulation. Also as a result, many of the side effects are similar to the symptoms of pregnancy. Alzheimer's has been shown to have a hormonal component, which could possibly be used as a method to prevent the disease. Male contraceptives utilizing sex hormones approach the problem in a similar way. The HPG axis can also be suppressed by GnRH antagonists or continuous administration of GnRH agonist, such as in the following applications *Ovarian suppression as breast cancer management, to prevent the body's formation of estrogen which may stimulate breast cancer cells. This is generally done by continuous administration of GnRH agonist. *Ovulation suppression as part of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in in vitro fertilization, in order to prevent the spontaneous ovulation of ovarian follicles before they can be harvested. =Stimulation= Ovulation induction is usually initially performed by giving an antiestrogen such as clomifene citrate or letrozole in order to decrease negative feedback on the pituitary gland, resulting in an increase in FSH with the aim of increasing folliculogenesis. It is the main initial medical treatment for anovulation.  Environment factors  Environment can have large impact on the HPG axis. One example is women with eating disorders suffer from oligomenorrhea and secondary amenorrhea. Starvation from anorexia nervosa or bulimia causes the HPG axis to deactivate causing women's ovarian and uterine cycles to stop. Stress, physical exercise, and weight loss have been correlated with oligomenorrhea and secondary amenorrhea. Similarly environmental factors can also affect men such as stress causing impotence. Prenatal exposure to alcohol can affect the hormones regulating fetal development resulting in foetal alcohol spectrum disorder.  Comparative anatomy  The HPG axis is highly conserved in the animal kingdom. While reproductive patterns may vary, the physical components and control mechanisms remain the same. The same hormones are used with some minor evolutionary modifications. Much of the research is done on animal models, because they mimic so well the control mechanism of humans. It is important to remember humans are the only species to hide their fertile period, but this effect is a difference in the effect of the hormones rather than a difference in the HPG axis.

It is 5.98 square kilometres in extent, stretching from to .Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End The site is designated both for its biological and its geological interest. The site includes a Nature Conservation Review site and eight Geological Conservation Review sites. The whole of the site is included in the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is within the Penwith Heritage Coast. Part of the site is within the West Penwith Environmentally Sensitive Area and some of the coast is owned and managed by the National Trust. The South West Coast Path, which follows the coast of south-west England from Somerset to Dorset passes through the SSSI. History The site or areas within it have previously been known by the following names: * Botallack Head to Cape Cornwall SSSI * Gurnard's Head and Porthmeor Cove, and Trevega and Trowan Cliffs SSSI * Cape Cornwall to Clodgy Point SSSI The site (under its current boundaries) was notified on 26 May 1995, having first been notified in 1972. However the Botallack Head to Cape Cornwall SSSI was first scheduled in 1967, and the Gurnard's Head and Porthmeor Cove, and Trevega and Trowan Cliffs SSSI was first scheduled in 1951. Description Aire Point to Carrick Du is located on the west and north coast of the Penwith peninsula, extending from a point approximately 3 km north east of Land's End to St Ives. The site is dominated by vertical sea cliffs formed by the Land's End granite mass. The cliffs are topped by steep slopes punctuated by sheer castellated granite cams. Associated Devonian slates and basaltic rocks, altered by the intrusion of the granite, display fine examples of the effects of contact metamorphism. The soils, which are often thin, are generally acidic, well drained with a gritty, loamy texture and a humic surface horizon. Iron panning has impeded drainage locally and peaty soils have developed where wet flushes occur. Exposure to salt spray and the prevailing south westerly winds have resulted in a dwarfed vegetation. Biological interest The site supports populations of Red Data Book and nationally scarce plants and animals. =Plant communities present on the site= The vegetation of the cliffs exhibits a complex of maritime and sub-maritime communities. The cliff slopes and tops are characterised by maritime grassland, heath and scrub communities with frequent species rich flushes, particularly on the north coast. The cliff faces support a maritime rock-crevice community with thrift Armeria maritima, rock samphire Crithmum maritimum, sea aster Aster tripolium and sea spleenwort Asplenium marinum as common components. On the shallow soils of rock ledges and outcrops, a maritime therophyte community occurs where typical species include: English stonecrop Sedum anglicum, thrift, buck's-horn plantain Plantago coronopus and kidney vetch Anthyllis vulneraria. The grassland communities of the cliff slopes are dominated by red fescue Festuca rubra which often forms a matressy sward, and Yorkshire-fog Holcus lanatus. Thrift, wild carrot Daucus carota, sea campion Silene maritima, sea plantain Plantago maritima and ox-eye daisy Leucanthemum vulgare are common. Where trampling occurs, or on thin soils, the grassland is characterised by buck's-horn plantain, ribwort plantain Plantago lanceolata, kidney vetch and spring squill Scilla verna. bluebell Hyacinthoides non-scripta is found in more sheltered areas and on upper slopes where it is typically associated with coarse grasses, mainly cock's-foot Dactylis glomerata and scrub communities. Extensive areas of heath occur generally higher up the cliff profile and on the cliff tops. These are dominated by heather Calluna vulgaris, bell heather Erica cinerea and western gorse Ulex gallii and often display the waved structure characteristic of exposure to saltladen winds. Spring squill, common bird's-foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, sheep's-bit Jasione montana and wild thyme Thymus drucei are abundant. The maritime communities support two Red Data Book species - the eyebright species Euphrasia vigursii and early meadow- grass Poa infirma. Nationally scarce plant plants found here include lanceolate spleenwort Asplenium billotti, hairy bird's-foot trefoil Lotus subbiflorus and pale dog-violet Viola lactea. Between Boscaswell Cliffs and Clodgy Point the site is characterised by a number of wet flushes and an extensive area of mire at Boswednack. The flushes are dominated by purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea and typical species occurring here include cross- leaved heath Erica tetralix, tormentil Potentilla erecta, sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus and royal fern Osmunda regalis. Other species of note associated with the wet flushes include bog asphodel Narthecium ossifragum, the cottongrass Eriophorum angustifolium and pale butterwort Pinguicula lusitanica. The nationally scarce plants Cornish moneywort Sibthorpia europaea and yellow bartsia Parentucellia viscosa are found at Boswednack. Scrub communities, including pure stands of bracken Pteridium aquilinum occur on the cliff slopes and tops and particularly in the valleys. European gorse Ulex europaeus, bramble Rubus fruticosus agg. and blackthorn Prunus spinosa are frequent, associated with cock's-foot, bluebell and, locally, honeysuckle Lonicera periclymenum and ivy Hedera helix. The site supports a typical Cornish cliff bryophyte flora and includes a number of rarities, most notably the Red Data Book moss Tortula solmsii. The west facing section of the coast between Aire Point and Kenidjack Castle displays examples of fully exposed rocky shore communities. The plants and animals are typical of a wave beaten coast with the lower shore characterised by the brown seaweeds \\"dabberlocks\\" Alaria esculenta and \\"tangle\\" Laminaria digitalis and pools containing coralline algae Corallina officinalis and pink encrusting Lithothamnion spp. =Invertebrates= The range of land habitats, many of which are floristically rich, support a diverse and abundant invertebrate fauna, including the following Red Data Book species: the mud snail Lymnaea glabra, the bug Heterogaster artimisae and the hoverfly Microdon mutabilis. Nationally scarce butterflies including the pearl-bordered fritillary Boloria euphrosyne and silver-studded blue Plebejus argus, and the nationally scarce jewel beetle Trachys troglodytes also occur. Limpets, Patella aspera are abundant and barnacles, mainly Chthamalus stellatus, are plentiful on the upper shore. =Birds= Cliff ledges provide nesting sites for seabirds including fulmar, shag, black-legged kittiwakes and gulls. Peregrine falcon, chough and raven nest on secluded cliff slopes and carns. Areas of scrub on the cliff tops and in the valleys provide nesting sites for European stonechat, whitethroat and sedge warbler. Grasshopper warblers breed in the scrub associated with the mires at Boswednack, which also provides suitable conditions for wintering water rail, Eurasian woodcock and Eurasian curlew. The location of this site at the southern-western tip of the British mainland makes it an important resting and feeding area for migratory birds, the more sheltered valleys being of particular importance. =Mammals= Grey seals are known to breed on this stretch of coast. Offshore islands, notably The Brisons and The Carracks, provide haul out sites for this species. The disused mines provide roosting sites for bats, including the greater horseshoe bat and Daubenton's bat.

Photo by V. Arsenyev Dersu Uzala (; alternate U.S. titles: With Dersu the Hunter and Dersu the Trapper) is a 1923 memoir by the Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev, concerning his travels with the hunter Dersu Uzala. Plot Arsenyev's book tells of his travels in the Ussuri basin in the Russian Far East. Dersu Uzala was a Nanai hunter (who lived c. 1849-1908) who acted as a guide for Arsenyev's surveying crew from 1902 to 1907, and saved them from starvation and cold. Arsenyev portrays him as a great man, an animist who sees animals and plants as equal to man. From 1907, Arsenyev invited Dersu to live in his house in Khabarovsk as Dersu's failing sight hampered his ability to live as a hunter. In the spring of 1908, Dersu bade farewell to Arsenyev and walked back to his home in the Primorsky Krai, where he was killed. According to Arsenyev's book, Dersu Uzala was murdered near the town of Korfovskiy and buried in an unmarked grave in the taiga.

Hemus is one of a select group of big league players to have held a dual role as a player-manager. Baseball career =Player= As a player (‚Äì1959) with the St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies, Hemus was primarily a shortstop, although he also saw significant time as a second baseman. Hemus compiled a lifetime batting average of .273 in 961 games and collected 736 hits, with 51 home runs and 263 RBI. The Phoenix native batted left-handed and threw right-handed. During his playing days, Hemus stood tall, weighing . =Manager and coach= Hemus was a hard-nosed player and manager known for battling with opponents and umpires; he was ejected 30 times between 1952 and 1965.Retrosheet When he was traded to the Phillies in May , Hemus wrote a letter to Cardinals owner August \\"Gussie\\" Busch, expressing his pride in being a Cardinal and his gratitude to the baseball club. Nearing the end of his playing career, he was reacquired by the Cardinals on September 29, 1958 ‚Äî one day after the season ended ‚Äî and named the St. Louis player-manager by Busch, who admired Hemus' fiery personality and remembered his letter from 2¬Ω years before.

His Cardinals were inconsistent. Hemus' first club lost 15 of its first 20 games and stumbled to a seventh place (71‚Äì83) finish in 1959. That was followed by a 15-game improvement (86‚Äì68) and a leap to third place in his second season (). The Redbirds followed with a mediocre start in and were mired in sixth place on July 5 (at 33‚Äì41), when Hemus was replaced by one of his coaches, Johnny Keane.1961 St. Louis Cardinals Schedule, Box Scores and Splits at Baseball- Reference.com His career managing record was 190‚Äì192 (.497). He was thrown out of 11 of the 382 games he managed, comprising over one-third of his career MLB ejections. Hemus then served as a coach with the New York Mets (1962‚Äì1963) and Cleveland Indians (1964‚Äì1965). He was on manager Casey Stengel's coaching staff when the 1962 Mets expansion team ended up with a record of 40‚Äì120, still the most losses by a Major League team in a single season since the nineteenth century. He managed the Mets' top farm club, the Jacksonville Suns of the Triple-A International League, in , before leaving baseball and entering the oil business in his adopted home city of Houston, Texas. During his tenure in Philadelphia, Hemus made history when he was removed for pinch runner John Kennedy at Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City, New Jersey, during a league game against the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 22, 1957.

For the first half of its history it appeared monthly, but relaunched as a bi-monthly during 2007.  Origins  Red Pepper was founded by the Socialist Movement ‚Äì an independent left-wing grouping that grew out of a series of large conferences held in Chesterfield in 1987 and 1988 after the defeat of Britain's miners' strike of the mid-1980s. The Socialist Movement set up a campaigning, fortnightly newspaper called Socialist in autumn 1991. It lasted through September 1992. Supporters of The Socialist were convinced that there was a demand for a regular green- left publication, published independently of any political party. After a fundraising drive, which raised an initial ¬£135,000, Red Pepper launched as a monthly in May 1995.Red Pepper magazine history page Its first editor was Denise Searle, who had also edited Socialist. But for most of its history, it has been edited by socialist and feminist Hilary Wainwright best known as the co-author of Beyond the Fragments. From 2004, she became co-editor alongside Oscar Reyes. In July 2009, Reyes stepped down and James O'Nions and Michael Calderbank replaced him, with Emma Hughes and Sarah-Jayne Clifton joining the editorial team in 2010. Now more of an editorial collective, the magazine today is edited by Wainwright, Calderbank and Ruth Potts. Prominent journalists involved with the publication at some point include Laurie Penny, Gary YoungeSee for instance 'What Obama means to the world' by Gary Younge in Red Pepper and Barbara Gunnell. The magazine's reported circulation in November 1995 was 13,000 copies. In 2004, it was reportedly 7,000 copies.  Politics  Red Pepper's editorial charter commits it to 'Internationalism; sustainable, socially useful production; welfare not warfare; and self- determination and democracy.‚Äô This charter claims it as: \\"a magazine of political rebellion and dissent. Influenced by socialism, feminism and green politics, it is a resource for all those who imagine and work to create another world ‚Äì a world based on equality, solidarity, and democracy\\". The magazine is unusual for the UK left, insofar as it is independent of any political party. Red Pepper has also collaborated in 'Eurotopia', a network of left and progressive European magazines which publishes a multilingual supplement. The magazine sees itself as closely aligned with the global justice movement and has taken part in the organising for the European Social ForumIPS news story on the European Social Forum. More recently it has supported Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Momentum festival The World Transformed.

The species is endemic to North America. Common names R. septemvittata is known by many common names, including the following: banded water snake, brown queen snake, diamond-back water snake, leather snake, moon snake, North American seven-banded snake, olive water snake, pale snake, queen water snake, seven-striped water snake, striped water snake, three-striped water snake, willow snake, and yellow-bellied snake.Wright, Albert Hazen; Wright, Anna Allen (1957). Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Ithaca and London: Comstock Publishing Associates, A Division of Cornell University Press. 1,105 pp. (in 2 volumes). (Natrix septemvittata, pp. 506-510, Figure 149 + Map 40 on p. 491). Geographic range R. septemvittata ranges through the temperate region of North America east of the Mississippi River from western New York state to Wisconsin and south to Alabama and northern Florida. It is also found in the southwestern parts of Ontario. New Jersey was at the edge of its range and it is now believed to be extirpated from the state.http://www.state.nj.us/dep/fgw/ensp/pdf/snake_broch07.pdf Ventral surface. Appearance The queen snake is similar in appearance to a garter snake, genus Thamnophis, so is often confused with that group. The queen snake is olive to gray or dark brown in overall coloration, with peach or yellow stripes that run down its length at the first scale row. There are also four prominent ventral stripes of a darker colour, and as no other similar species has stripes running down the length of its belly, this is an important feature in identifying this snake. In the young and juvenile snakes there are three extra stripes: one stripe that runs along the vertebral dorsal scales, and two stripes (one on each side) that run down the length of the body at scale rows five and six. These extra stripes tend to fade as the snake matures, but when young the snake will have a total of seven stripes, three on the back and four on the belly, which gives cause for its taxonomical reference name, Regina (queen) septemvittata (seven-striped). The belly of the snake is a cream to yellow colour. The head of the queen snake is narrow and has nine large plate- like scales on the top, and the chin has several rows of thicker scales. This is a protective adaptation, for the snake's feeding habit of chasing its prey under rocks. The pupil of the eye is round, a feature shared with most other colubrids. There are 19 rows of keeled dorsal scales at midbody, and the anal plate is divided. The sexes are often difficult to distinguish based on external characteristics. Male queen snakes have relatively longer tails than females. Males have from 65 to 89 subcaudal scutes (average 76), with the tail from 23% to 34% of the snake's total length. Females have 54 to 87 subcaudals (average 69), with tails equal to 19% to 27% of total length. Nine plate-like scales on top of head. Queen snakes are not large, and they seldom grow to more than in total length (including tail). The females are generally slightly larger than the males. Reproduction Female queen snakes will be fully sexually mature at three years of age, males at two years. Breeding takes place in the spring and autumn months. If mating was in the autumn, the female can delay giving birth till spring, storing the energy she will need through the months that she will be in a period of brumation. This snake is ovoviviparous, the female giving birth to live young after carrying the eggs within her body. This differs from oviparous and viviparous snakes. Litter size can vary from 5 to 20, and the time for an individual birth is from 1.5 to 2.5 minutes. Time between individual births is 4 minutes to 1 hour, with the average time being 11 minutes. The newly born snakes will be approximately long and weigh . Newborn snakes begin to grow very rapidly and may shed their skin twice in their first week while living on the nutrient rich yolk stores they preserve through this time in their lives. The baby snakes are able to swim and move about and they must fend for themselves independently directly after birth. Juvenile queen snakes range from in length. Habitat The habitat requirements for the queen snake are very specific, and this snake is never found in areas that lack clean running streams and watersheds with stony and rocky bottoms. The water temperature must be a minimum of during the snake's active months. This is in a large part due to the snake's dietary requirements. They subsist almost entirely on fresh water crayfish. It preys almost exclusively on newly-molted crayfish, which are not able to defend themselves effectively with their pincers. One study indicates that crayfish make up over 90% of the snake's diet. Other sources of food include frogs, tadpoles, newts, minnows, snails, and fairy shrimp. The queen snake does not find its food by sight or heat detection, but by smell, using its tongue to carry the scent of its prey to receptors within its mouth. In this way it is able to home in on its prey, even under water. Habits The queen snake is in a period of brumation throughout the winter months, and groups of them can be found in \\"hibernacula\\", near water. These hibernation dens can be inside old bridge abutments, cracked concrete retaining walls and dams, and in niches of bedrock. During this time, the snakes are lethargic, and their main prey, crayfish, may become the predator, particularly of the young snakes. Basking. It is a diurnal species, but it can be found moving about and hunting at night as well. They are often found by turning over rocks within or near the brooks and streams they inhabit. They will also come out of the water to bask in the sun, often perching on branches or roots above or near the waters edge. Queen snakes are very alert to any potential danger and will drop into the water when disturbed. They are rather docile snakes, not too likely to bite and can be easily handled. However, in doing so, one risks being polluted by malodorous feces and anal musk, similar to the behaviour of the garter snake in this defense. Predators of queen snakes are raccoons, otters, mink, hawks and herons. Large frogs and fish will also eat the young snakes. The main threat to the queen snake is habitat loss as waterways are drained, disturbed or polluted. Crayfish, their main food, are sensitive to acidification and accumulation of heavy metals. Thus, as waterways have become polluted and crayfish have died out, the queen snake population has declined throughout its former range. In many areas the queen snake has disappeared or has become in danger of doing so. References  Sources  *Gibbons, Whit; Dorcas, Michael (2005). Snakes of the Southeast.

The population of the village (including Passenham) at the 2011 Census was 1,935. The 'Stratford' part of the village name is Anglo-Saxon in origin and means 'ford on a Roman road'. The Roman road in this sense is the Watling Street that runs through the middle of the village. Location The village lies immediately north of where the Watling Street crossed the River Great Ouse; just south of this crossing point is the town of Stony Stratford in Milton Keynes. (The ford was replaced by a causeway and stone bridge many years ago). The Ouse forms the boundary of the civil parish with that of Stony Stratford and also that between Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire.Map of Old Stratford and Passenham Originally located on the junction of the A5, the A422 and the A508, these roads now bypass the village on its northern edge. History The Buckingham Arm of the Grand Union Canal passed through the village but has been disused since 1964. There remains a \\"Wharf Lane\\" and signs of the path of the old canal through the village towards Buckingham. Facilities The village has a few local facilities (two motor dealers, a Chinese takeaway, an Indian restaurant and a corner shop), and relies on Stony Stratford and Milton Keynes for a broader range of shops as well as for its medical, financial and other professional needs. There is a primary school part of Northamptonshire County Council local education authority. The nearest secondary school is in Deanshanger. Administration The village has a parish council,Old Stratford Parish Council which also administers the nearby village of Passenham. The village is administered by South Northamptonshire District Council, based in Towcester and also Northamptonshire County Council. The \\"Stony Stratford\\" Hoard The Stony Stratford Hoard The Stony Stratford Hoard was probably found in 1789, near Passenham in the parish of Old Stratford, across the River Ouse from Stony Stratford. It is not known where it originally came from or how it got there. Even the location of the find-spot is somewhat speculative, since the only recorded information is \\"Windmill Field\\".

He has worked on Dungeons & Dragons games for Wizards of the Coast. He won the Origins Award for Return to the Tomb of Horrors and has also won several ENnies. He lives in Seattle. Early life and education Bruce Cordell played Dungeons & Dragons as a youth, and even recalled playing the original Tomb of Horrors adventure with future fellow game designer Monte Cook when they were in high school together. Cordell was a wrestler and a debater, and also earned a degree in Biology from the University of Colorado. Cordell once worked in the biopharmaceutical industry where he learned to synthesize DNA. Roleplaying work Cordell worked on freelance game design while working in the scientific field, and was eventually hired as a full-time game designer by TSR in 1995. Cordell created the Far Realm for the adventure The Gates of Firestorm Peak (1996). He authored the Sea Devils Adventure Trilogy, The Illithiad, the Shattered Circle, Bastion of Faith, the Dungeon Builder's Guidebook, and the adventures Die Vecna Die!, Return to the Tomb of Horrors, and Return to White Plume Mountain for the AD&D; game, as well as the Tangents sourcebook and The Killing Jar adventure for the Alternity game. Cordell and Steve Miller worked on Die Vecna Die! (2000) together, an original adventure that brought an end to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons line. Cordell was also one of the designers working on the first new adventures for the 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons game, beginning with The Sunless Citadel. Cordell and Rich Baker wrote a new version of the Gamma World Roleplaying Game (2010), which was based on the fourth edition D&D; rules. He won the Origins Award for Return to the Tomb of Horrors, and ENnies for Mindscapes, If Thoughts Could Kill, and his work on the Manual of the Planes. Bruce wrote the novels Oath of Nerull, Lady of Poison, Darkvision, Stardeep, and the Abolethic Sovereignty trilogy. Short stories he's written have appeared in various anthologies, including \\"Black Arrow\\" in Realms of War. Bruce Cordell's RPG work includes many scenarios and sourcebooks; many of which are directly or indirectly concerned with monsters of a Lovecraftian bent (particularly mind flayers and psionics). Cordell frequently references certain characters, ideas, and organizations in his RPG works, creating a private continuity between various supplements. For example, The Illithiad references the character of Strom Wakeman and the organization known as the Arcane Order (an organization detailed heavily in another of Cordell's works, College of Wizardry). Wakeman was quoted occasionally in Planescape books by Cordell, such as A Guide to the Ethereal Plane, and was instrumental to the course of events in the adventure Dawn of the Overmind (books which were themselves also connected through a phenomenon called an ether gap). Meanwhile, the Arcane Order returned in Tome and Blood as a detailed organization and the basis of a prestige class. Most of Cordell's work for Malhavoc Press has followed similar patterns, creating a sort of story arc across When the Sky Falls, If Thoughts Could Kill, and Hyperconscious, connected by the god-like Dark Plea and, to a lesser extent, the kureshim race. In an interview with Monte Cook, Cordell himself described his style as including \\"subtle story threads that connect seemingly unrelated projects\\".A Talk With Bruce R. Cordell, Cordell co-designed the 4th Edition Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, and Gamma World Seventh Edition. After working for a few years as a designer on the fifth edition of D&D;, Cordell left Wizards in July 2013. In August of the same year he joined Monte Cook at Cook's company Monte Cook Games, LLC (also called MCG) as Senior Designer. Not long after, MCG Kickstarted another RPG, The Strange. The Strange, co-written by Cordell and Cook, was published in August 2014.

The station operated from 1968 to 2019 as the campus radio station of The College of Wooster, before the college transitioned it to online-only operation in April 2019. The station is now owned by Educational Media Foundation, and carries EMF's K-LOVE contemporary Christian format. History =WCWS-FM at The College of Wooster= The College of Wooster's first venture into radio was the short-lived station WABW, which broadcast for one year in 1926. A carrier current outlet, \\"WCW\\", went on the air in 1950, and in 1956, the school struck a deal with commercial station WWST-FM in which the college received two hours of airtime a day. The WWST-FM agreement ended in November 1966 as FM radio became a more profitable venture, prompting the college to apply for its own station. On September 12, 1967, the college filed for a construction permit of its own, which was granted on December 5. WCWS received its license on May 24, 1968, and it began regular operations that fall. The station broadcast the New York Metropolitan Opera and also was supplied with United Press International wire service. In the mid-1980s, the station increased its effective radiated power to 890 watts and went stereo. In 1987, WCWS-FM changed frequencies to 90.9 MHz in order to reduce co-channel interference to WKCO at Kenyon College. However, an attempt to increase the station's power further caused unanticipated problems for the college physics department, requiring the transmitter to be moved off campus and to Back Orville Road in 1992. In 2004, RB Schools, a Texas Christian radio group, challenged the licenses of WCWS-FM and 12 other radio stations during the FCC license renewal process in an attempt to enforce non-consensual time-sharing of the channel. Due to the efforts of the College of Wooster administration, Herman Gibbs, John Finn, and the student management, the FCC denied the challenge in May 2005. As a result, WCWS-FM was revamped as \\"WOO 91, Wooster's Sound Alternative\\", with a new image and improved sound; it also began broadcasting 24 hours a day. In the fall of 2013, WCWS-FM moved out of Wishart Hall to Lowry Center, Wooster‚Äôs student center, increasing the visibility of the station on the college's campus. =Transition to online and sale to EMF= In August 2018, The College of Wooster announced that WOO 91 would become an online-only station, citing the burden of maintaining the facility and increased FCC reporting requirements; the school's dean of students said that the maintenance of the FM station was \\"no longer sustainable\\". WCWS-FM went silent on April 8, 2019. On December 30, 2019, the College of Wooster filed to sell the WCWS-FM license to Educational Media Foundation for $170,000. As a condition of the asset purchase agreement, the transmitter will be relocated to a new site.FCC: BALED - 20191230AAB Assignment of License ‚Äî WCWS-FM The call sign was changed to WKWO on March 12, 2020, coincident with the consummation of the sale.

Early life and education Angel attended Canoga Park High School and Chatsworth High School. In 1982, she earned an associate degree in Sign Language Interpreting from Los Angeles Pierce College. She has a certificate from the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in Los Angeles. Career Angel became interested in body piercing after a casual encounter with a woman bearing a nipple piercing at a Renaissance Faire in 1981. Through her encounter, she became involved with and employed by Gauntlet, then the first and only, body piercing studio in the United States. While employed by Gauntlet, she worked at the Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco branches. She was the first recipient of a Master Piercer certificate, from Gauntlet founder Jim Ward, which she received on December 1, 1992. Her technical contributions to the field of body piercing include the invention of several placements, including the fourchette and the lorum piercings. In December 1993, Angel opened her own studio, Rings of Desire, in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Rings of Desire was the first body piercing studio to receive state licensing from the Health Department in Louisiana. Angel has been involved with the crafting of regulatory legislation regarding body piercing in Louisiana, as well as the training of the professionals who enforce those laws. In this capacity, Angel distributed the research study for the University of South Alabama on the relationship between female sexual satisfaction and vertical clitoral hood piercing. Positive results were published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. While in New Orleans, she established, with Justine Roig, a store catering to accessories for small dogs called Chiwawa Gaga. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Angel closed her New Orleans studio and relocated to M√©rida, Yucat√°n, Mexico. In March 2009, her book The Piercing Bible--The Definitive Guide to Safe Body Piercing was published. Although Angel lives in Mexico, she works primarily internationally as a guest body piercer and piercing educator.

They divorced under controversial circumstances in 2014, with Angel claiming he was not eligible for alimony payments due to Buck Angel's gender status under Louisiana law. Elayne Angel lost the case in a California court. Trademark tattoo Angel is widely known for a large tattoo of angel wings on her back. The lower right wing is interrupted by a heart with a banner across it reading \\"slave\\". This design, which was the inspiration for the logo for her studio, was registered as a U.S. service mark (No. 2,645,270, issued November 5, 2002) and was done in 1987 by Bob Roberts of Spotlight Tattoo in Los Angeles, California. It has since been cancelled due to the registration not being renewed. After receiving the service mark for this design, the circled \\"R\\" was added to her right buttock by tattooist Joey Galiger at the advice of her attorney.

Murphy quickly rose to a position of unsurpassed influence in state government. He became so politically powerful during his speakership, that he is largely credited with helping his legislative prot√©g√©, Joe Frank Harris, get elected governor in 1982. During his tenure, Murphy was a key figure in Georgia's economic development and throughout statewide politics; and was considered by many to be the best friend Atlanta ever had in the legislature despite his rural residency and upbringing. In 2000, speaking of Murphy, noted political columnist Bill Shipp wrote, \\"In his 26 years as presiding officer of the House, he has become as powerful and important in the General Assembly as the governor.\\" Murphy's brusque manners could be off putting, and often required the more diplomatic intervention of his speaker pro tempore, Jack Connell. U.S. District Judge Dudley Bowen Jr observed that Tom Murphy was a powerhouse, and he was an administration unto himself. And Connell knew how to be nice to people. Connell knew how to work with people. =Reapportionment and downfall= Fiercely partisan, Murphy described himself as a \\"yellow dog\\" Democrat, or one who would rather vote for a yellow dog than vote for a Republican. U.S. Representative Lynn Westmoreland, who served in the state house from 1993 to 2005‚Äìthe last four years as minority leader‚Äìput it bluntly: \\"Tom Murphy wasn't fair, he wasn't bipartisan and he didn't light up a room with his smile.\\" In 1991 and 2001, Murphy presided over the reapportionment process which redrew congressional and legislative lines. In part because of his efforts to make the seats of Newt Gingrich (1991) and Bob Barr (2001) less friendly to Republicans, the resulting district maps were criticized as partisan Democratic gerrymanders. The maps were seen as a typical example of his \\"hardball\\" approach to political power. Gingrich, who was Murphy's congressman for 14 years, recalled that Murphy, \\"by raising money and gerrymandering, has sincerely dedicated a part of his career to wiping me out.\\" Murphy frequently skated to reelection, but faced increasingly competitive races from the late 1980s onward as Atlanta's suburbs began bleeding into his district. Indeed, Republican candidates began winning up and down the ballot in the district during this time. In 2000, he faced his closest race yet against Republican Bill Heath. Murphy only held on by 505 votes, a margin of less than two percentage points. Gerrymandering ultimately proved to be Murphy's downfall. The contorted districts that resulted from the 2001 remap both confused and angered voters, and is believed to have led to Murphy losing his own seat in 2002 in a rematch against Heath. Shortly after the controversial 2001 reapportionment process, and Murphy's own political defeat, political power shifted in favor of the Republicans, who gained control of both chambers of the Legislature, the Governor's office, and the majority of statewide elected offices. A number of Murphy's lieutenants, including Lauren \\"Bubba\\" McDonald and Reapportionment committee Chairman Bob Hanner, who was Murphy's point man on efforts to re-draw district lines to favor Democrats, left the Democratic Party and joined with their former political rivals when power shifted to the Republicans. Personal life In May 2004, Murphy's grandson M. Chad Long, a lobbyist, and four others including former State Representative Robin L. Williams and former Atlanta Braves player Rick Camp were indicted on charges that they stole more than $2 million from the Community Mental Health Center of East Central Georgia. In 2005, in U.S. District Court, Williams was convicted on 17 counts related to conspiracy, bribery, theft, health care fraud and money laundering, while the others were convicted on fewer counts. Long was found guilty of conspiracy and health-care fraud. All were sentenced to federal prison terms. Williams was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, Camp received a sentence of 37 months, and Long received a shorter sentence. The group, except Long, appealed their convictions, but in March 2007 the appeal was turned down. A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in an unsigned decision that it found no merit to any of the arguments. Death and legacy Murphy suffered a stroke in 2004, which left him incapacitated. He died at 10:00 p.m. on December 17, 2007, in Bremen after years of declining health. To honor his service to Georgia, Murphy lay in state at the Georgia State Capitol on December 21, 2007‚Äîfirst within the House chambers and then in the Capitol Rotunda. When Murphy died, Georgia Republican U. S. Senator Johnny Isakson said, \\"Tom Murphy was a giant in Georgia politics, and his legacy is everywhere. Without Tom Murphy there would be no World Congress Center, or Georgia Dome or MARTA.\\" Isakson went on to say, \\"As tough as he was on the outside, he had a soft spot in his heart for children, the poor and the sick. He was a product of the Depression and it left a lasting impression on him. In many a speech Speaker Murphy would reflect on the days of his youth and would vow never to let a Georgia child face the conditions he did.\\" References See also * List of Speakers of the Georgia House of Representatives External links * Category:1924 births Category:2007 deaths Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:Georgia (U.S. state) lawyers Category:Members of the Georgia House of Representatives Category:University of Georgia alumni Category:United States Navy sailors Category:People from Bremen, Georgia Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Democrats Category:20th-century American politicians Category:21st- century American politicians Category:Speakers of the Georgia House of Representatives ","title":"Tom Murphy (Georgia politician)"},{"id":"2537956","text":"HNoMS Trygg (trygg is Norwegian for safe, secure, dependable) was a torpedo boat of the Royal Norwegian Navy. Her hull was built in Moss and she was finished in Horten, with build number 109. Trygg had two sister ships: HNoMS Sn√∏gg and HNoMS Stegg. Together the three vessels formed the Trygg class of torpedo boats.  Neutrality protection  At the outbreak of the Second World War, Trygg and other Norwegian warships were deployed along the Norwegian coastline to guard against neutrality violations by the warring parties. In one incident the British submarine Triad suffered technical difficulties off the Norwegian coast and was forced to enter Norwegian territorial waters near Bergen on 1 December 1939. After the submarine had been allowed to carry out rudimentary emergency repairs, Trygg escorted her out of Norwegian waters the next day. Norwegian Campaign service During the Norwegian Campaign Trygg was commanded by Lieutenant Frantz W. Munster and served in an air defence and escort role against the invading Germans outside Molde and √Öndalsnes in April 1940 (√Öndalsnes landings). After surviving numerous air attacks the ship was finally sunk at √Öndalsnes 25 April 1940.Sivertsen 2001: 127 As the torpedo boat was anchored up in the harbour the Luftwaffe bombers first attacked and knocked out British AA positions ashore before turning their attention towards the small Norwegian warship. A total of sixteen bombs were dropped against Trygg, one hitting the stern of the ship and passing through without exploding. The damage the bomb caused on its way through Trygg was however too much for her to stay afloat.Berg 1997: 51 Although Munster beached his ship before the stern went under, the ship settled on her side and sank in shallow waters the next day. German service as the Zick The ship was salvaged by the Germans, renamed Zick, later renamed again to V.5506 Zick, and served as a Vorpostenboot on the coast of Norway until she was sunk by 21 de Havilland Mosquitos from 235 and 248 Squadrons RAF on 23 October 1944. She was escorting a three-ship convoy in Hjeltefjord near Bergen when the convoy came under attack by the rocket and autocannon firing Mosquitos.Hafsten 1991: 198-199 All three cargo ships in the convoy suffered damage while Zick was blown apart, taking three Germans down with her. Before she was sunk Zick managed to slightly damage two of the attacking aircraft with her anti-aircraft armament.

It was proved by Valery Oseledets (also spelled \\"Oseledec\\") in 1965 and reported at the International Mathematical Congress in Moscow in 1966. A conceptually different proof of the multiplicative ergodic theorem was found by M. S. Raghunathan. The theorem has been extended to semisimple Lie groups by V. A. Kaimanovich and further generalized in the works of David Ruelle, Grigory Margulis, Anders Karlsson, and Fran√ßois Ledrappier. Cocycles The multiplicative ergodic theorem is stated in terms of matrix cocycles of a dynamical system. The theorem states conditions for the existence of the defining limits and describes the Lyapunov exponents. It does not address the rate of convergence. A cocycle of an autonomous dynamical system X is a map C : X√óT ‚Üí Rn√ón satisfying :C(x,0)=I_n {\\\\rm~for~all~} x\\\\in X :C(x,t+s)=C(x(t),s)\\\\,C(x,t) {\\\\rm~for~all~} x\\\\in X {\\\\rm~and~} t,s\\\\in T where X and T (with T = Z‚Å∫ or T = R‚Å∫) are the phase space and the time range, respectively, of the dynamical system, and In is the n-dimensional unit matrix. The dimension n of the matrices C is not related to the phase space X. = Examples = * A prominent example of a cocycle is given by the matrix Jt in the theory of Lyapunov exponents. In this special case, the dimension n of the matrices is the same as the dimension of the manifold X. * For any cocycle C, the determinant det C(x, t) is a one-dimensional cocycle.  Statement of the theorem  Let Œº be an ergodic invariant measure on X and C a cocycle of the dynamical system such that for each t ‚àà T, the maps x \\\\rightarrow \\\\log\\\\C(x,t)\\\\ and x \\\\rightarrow \\\\log\\\\C(x,t)^{-1}\\\\ are L1-integrable with respect to Œº. Then for Œº-almost all x and each non-zero vector u ‚àà Rn the limit :\\\\lambda=\\\\lim_{t\\\\to\\\\infty}{1\\\\over t} \\\\log{\\\\C(x,t)u\\\\ \\\\over \\\\u\\\\} exists and assumes, depending on u but not on x, up to n different values. These are the Lyapunov exponents. Further, if Œª1 > ... > Œªm are the different limits then there are subspaces Rn = R1 ‚äÉ ... ‚äÉ Rm ‚äÉ Rm+1 = {0} such that the limit is Œªi for u ‚àà Ri \\\\ Ri+1 and i = 1, ..., m. The values of the Lyapunov exponents are invariant with respect to a wide range of coordinate transformations. Suppose that g : X ‚Üí X is a one-to-one map such that \\\\partial g/\\\\partial x and its inverse exist; then the values of the Lyapunov exponents do not change.  Additive versus multiplicative ergodic theorems  Verbally, ergodicity means that time and space averages are equal, formally: :\\\\lim_{t\\\\to\\\\infty}{1\\\\over t} \\\\int_0^t f(x(s))\\\\,ds = {1\\\\over \\\\mu(X)} \\\\int_X f(x)\\\\,\\\\mu(dx) where the integrals and the limit exist. Space average (right hand side, Œº is an ergodic measure on X) is the accumulation of f(x) values weighted by Œº(dx). Since addition is commutative, the accumulation of the f(x)Œº(dx) values may be done in arbitrary order. In contrast, the time average (left hand side) suggests a specific ordering of the f(x(s)) values along the trajectory. Since matrix multiplication is, in general, not commutative, accumulation of multiplied cocycle values (and limits thereof) according to C(x(t0),tk) = C(x(tk‚àí1),tk ‚àí tk‚àí1) ... C(x(t0),t1 ‚àí t0) -- for tk large and the steps ti ‚àí ti‚àí1 small -- makes sense only for a prescribed ordering. Thus, the time average may exist (and the theorem states that it actually exists), but there is no space average counterpart. In other words, the Oseledets theorem differs from additive ergodic theorems (such as G. D. Birkhoff's and J. von Neumann's) in that it guarantees the existence of the time average, but makes no claim about the space average. References * * External links * V. I.

His best-remembered role may be that of hapless flower shop owner Gravis Mushnik in the 1960 low-budget Roger Corman dark comedy, The Little Shop of Horrors. Life and career Welles was born Ira W. Meltcher in the Bronx, New York City, son of Max and Sally Grichewsky Meltcher. He was raised in Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania and graduated from Mt. Carmel High School, in 1940. He went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Penn State University, a Master of Arts degree from West Virginia University, and a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia University. Welles held a number of jobs during his lifetime; at one time or another he worked as a clinical psychologist, radio DJ, television actor, writer and film director. He did some stage work before traveling to Hollywood, where in 1953 he appeared in his first film, Appointment in Honduras. His favorite role (The Little Shop of Horrors) was also his last in the U.S. for many years. In the early 1960s, he left the United States initially to make a film in Germany. After the producer was arrested he travelled to Rome to act, produce and direct mostly uncredited primarily in Europe several film productions including the cult horror films Maneater of Hydra (1967) and Lady Frankenstein (1971). His fluency in five languages proved to be most helpful where he started a dubbing company that by his own estimate dubbed over 800 European made films.Paul, Louis Mel Welles Interview in Tales from the Cult film Trenches: Interviews with 36 Actors from Horror, Science Fiction and Exploitation Cinema McFarland 06/09/2007 He also served as a film consultant. Later, he returned to the U.S., appearing in a number of films, doing voice work, and teaching voice acting. Probably his most widely seen work in the late 1970s was his English adaptation of the Japanese television show, \\"Spectreman\\" which was seen on UHF and cable across the United States. While he shares writing credit with two other people, it's clear that most of the English voice work, and the offbeat humor, is his. Reportedly, Welles also wrote gag material for Lord Buckley at some point in his career. In 1998, Welles took to the stage in a community theater production of Little Shop of Horrors as Mushnik, the role he created in the original Roger Corman film. Welles had never performed in the musical and was happy to be asked to do the role, which he described as a \\"mitzvah\\" for Scotts Valley Performing Arts. Jonathan Haze, who played Seymour in the original film, attended the opening, and Welles also received a visit from Martin P. Robinson, the designer of the Audrey II plant puppets used in the off-Broadway production (Robinson is also famous for his puppetry on Sesame Street). Arguably his most remembered piece is the beat poem he wrote for the classic film High School Confidential (1958). Famously delivered by Phillipa Fallon, Dragsville, has become a classic piece of literary and cinema history. Welles was working on a horror screenplay, tentatively titled House of a Hundred Horrors, at the time of his death. Filmography *The Golden Blade (1953) ....

While the objects that exemplify properties are discovered through traditional empirical means, a simple set of axioms allows us to know about objects that encode properties.

Overview Originally developed for the US Navy during the late 1960s, the AGM-78 was created in large part because of the limitations of the AGM-45 Shrike, which suffered from a small warhead, limited range and a poor guidance system. General Dynamics was asked to create an air- launched ARM by modifying the RIM-66 SM-1 surface-to-air missile. This use of an \\"off the shelf\\" design greatly reduced development costs, and trials of the new weapon began in 1967 after only a year of development. The first operational missiles were issued in early 1968. The AGM-78 was nicknamed the \\"starm\\", an abbreviation of Standard ARM. The first version of the missile, the A1 Mod 0, was little more than an air-launched RIM-66 with the Shrike's anti radar seeker head attached to the front. An Aerojet Mark 27 MOD 4 dual- thrust solid-rocket-powered the missile, which was fitted with a blast- fragmentation warhead. Although more capable, the AGM-78 was much more expensive than the AGM-45 Shrike which continued in service for some time. The new missile was carried by the F-105F/G and the A-6B/E. Variants 6010th WWS F-105G taking off to North Vietnam, 1971. IAF Museum An inert training version of the AGM-78A was built as ATM-78A. Of equal size, mass and shape, the missile lacked a seeker head, warhead, or propulsion systems and was essentially just a dead weight. An A2 model introduced a bomb damage assessment (BDA) capability and an SDU-6/B phosphorus target marker flare to facilitate targeting of the site for follow up attacks. In 1969 an improved model called the AGM-78B was produced. This featured a broadband seeker which allowed the missile to be used against a much wider variety of targets without having to select the seeker before the mission. A simple memory circuit was also included, allowing the missile to attack a target once it locked on, even if the radar was shut down. Previous ARMs would veer off course and miss when they lost a target, and as a result flipping the radar on and off had become a standard tactic for missile batteries. Some early AGM-78A1s were updated with the new memory circuit and seeker. These missiles were designated as the AGM-78A4. The AGM-78B was the most important version of the missile, and was widely used by the Air Force's F-4G Phantom II Wild Weasel aircraft. A training version of the AGM-78B was created, and was known as the ATM-78B. In the early 1970s the AGM-78C was produced. A US Air Force project, the C model was primarily intended to be more reliable and cheaper to build. It had a SDU-29/B white phosphorus target marker. Some older missiles were upgraded to the AGM-78C standard. As before, an ATM-78C training missile was produced. Between 1973 and 1976 the AGM-78D was produced, introducing a new motor. A follow up missile, the AGM-78D2, had an active optical fuze, still greater reliability, and a new blast-fragmentation warhead. The ATM-78D training missile followed. The RGM-66D shipborne anti-radiation missile used the basic AGM-78 airframe along with features of the RIM-66 and AIM-97 Seekbat air-to- air missile. Including all versions, over 3,000 AGM-78 missiles were built. Production stopped in the late 1970s, but the missile continued in service for almost a decade before the last examples were replaced by the AGM-88 HARM in the late 1980s.

The series was originally developed by the Oliver twins; however, they had little involvement with this title other than executive sign off ‚Äî confident in leaving Big Red Software to redesign the graphics engine and design the game and puzzles. The game is the fifth in the Dizzy series, excluding arcade spinoffs such as Kwik Snax and boasted the largest map of any Dizzy game yet at the time of release, having more than 100 screens. Consequently, it is by far longer and more difficult than any other game in the series. –ïven 'instant walkthrough' would take about one and a half hours.Instant walkthrough playlist The gameplay is also complicated by the fact that Dizzy loses health when falling from heights (the feature was removed from subsequent games). This level of difficulty made many players cheat by using patches giving Dizzy unlimited lives. The game also presents slightly different user interface, graphics and concepts that never occurred earlier or later in the series: an inventory with items icons, separated collection (stars) and healing (apples) items (in other games they are always '2 in 1'), hidden passages and dynamic animated set pieces (the travel tunnels, the mining cart, etc.) There are additional Dizzy animations and abilities, swimming for instance (once the player gets the flippers), eating frames, concussed frames (after falling), and so on. The Spectrum version of the game, like all the titles since Dizzy 3, has both 48k and 128k versions packaged. The 128k version features richer graphics and animation, extended dialogue and a background music track. Besides that, the acid raindrops in it are harder to avoid due to a different animation sequence.  Plot  Dizzy's been visiting his local friendly Wizard Theo. Now Theo, who may be a dab hand in the waving of wands area, is not much cop at the filing- things-away-neatly department, and he's left his Book of Really Powerful Spells lying round in his laboratory. What's more, the book's been left open at the page headed A Really, Really, Powerful Spell (That Shouldn't Be Read Out Loud).

The ARSR-4 is the FAA's most recent (late 1980s, early 1990s) addition to the \\"Long Range\\" series of radars, a solid state Westinghouse system with a range. In addition, the ARSR-4 features a \\"look down\\" capability that enables the radar to detect aircraft attempting to elude detection by flying at low altitudes, advanced clutter reduction via hardware and software post-processing, and enhanced poor-weather detection of aircraft. A Beacon system, the ATCBI-6M (a monopulse system), is installed along with each ARSR-4. However, since the ARSR-4 is a 3D radar, it is capable of determining aircraft altitude independently of its associated Beacon (albeit less accurately). ARSR-4 systems are installed along the borders and coastal areas of the continental United States, Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, the municipality of Yigo on Guam, and a training site at the FAA's Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City. They are generally unmanned, being equipped with remote monitoring of both the radar data and the status of the radar's health and environment.

Existing ARSR-1 systems were then retrofitted with the more reliable ARSR-2 components. All ARSR-1/2 systems have been replaced With modern Common ARSR systems. Electron tubes like the one Vice President Gore used in a televised interview to symbolize the need for FAA modernization were still in use nationwide prior to the Common ARSR upgrade. All ARSR-1/2s were replaced by the Common ARSR by the end of 2015. Common ARSR is abbreviated as CARSR. The CARSR has a range, and shares transmitter components and software with the FAA's newest airport surveillance radar the ASR-11. Like the ASR-11, the CARSR is a completely solid state RADAR. The Westinghouse-built ARSR-3 and 3D search radar was used by the FAA in the Joint Surveillance System (JSS). The radar operated in the L-band at 1250 to 1350 MHz and detected targets at a distance beyond . The D model had height-finder capability. The Westinghouse-(now Northrop- Grumman)-ARSR-4 built 3-D air surveillance radar in the 1990s for the JSS. By the late 1990s, this radar had replaced most of the 1960s-vintage AN/FPS-20 variant search radars and a number of ARSR-3 search radars under a project termed the \\"FAA/Air Force Radar Replacement\\" (FARR) program.

Geography There are two discrete parts of this site - Lower Bostraze China Clay Works and Leswidden Block Works; together they are 23,000 m¬≤ in size. Lower Bostraze is located at , and Leswidden at . The site was notified as an SSSI in 1996. The site lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Penwith Heritage Coast and is partly within the West Penwith Environmentally Sensitive Area. The site has also been designated a Special Area of Conservation. Both parts of the site are underlain by the Land's End granite, part of the Cornubian batholith. Zones within the granite, altered by kaolinisation, have been extensively worked for china clay until recent years. China clay was discovered in the Balleswidden sett in 1880 and both areas are located within disused china clay workings, consisting of pits, benches, spoil tips and granitic debris with sparse vegetation cover. Wildlife and ecology The site's SSSI status is due to the presence of important populations of a very rare liverwort, the Western Rustwort (Marsupella profunda). This species is rare in a British context (it is known from only two other locations in the UK: St Austell Clay Pits and Tregonning Hill, both within Cornwall). However, it is also internationally rare, being known only from Portugal, the Canary Islands, the Azores and Madeira; throughout this range it is a rare species. At Lower Bostraze and Leswidden, Western Rustwort is generally found growing on micaceous or clay waste substrates which are flat or gently sloping. Some patches occur on granitic rocks, usually where these are soft or crumbling. It appears to be a pioneer species, the largest populations being found on surfaces showing the early stages of colonisation by other bryophytes and by vascular plants. The conservation charity Plantlife designated the St Just Moors, part of this SSSI, an Important Plant Area for the occurrence of Western Rustwort and the green algae desmids. Toponymy The meaning of Bostraze is \\"dwelling in a flat-bottomed valley\\". There is a place called Bostrase in the parish of St Hilary (with the same meaning). The meaning of Leswidden is \\"white / fair ruin\\".Craig Weatherhill (2009) A Concise Dictionary of Cornish Place-Names. Westport, Co.

It is home to several large retailers, the largest being one of Tesco's flagship stores‚Äîat 11,055 square metres (119,000 sq ft) which was also the largest supermarket in the United Kingdom for one period of time. Kingston Park is served by Kingston Park station on the Tyne and Wear Metro.  History  The suburb was largely built in the end of the 1970s and beginning of the 1980s, and its Metro station was not part of the original system, because the area did not have the required population density, when the Metro was first planned.https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/fawdon In the 2010s, the Great Park development began to extend north from Kingston Park, with the Greenside Estate being located immediately north of Kingston Park Road. The residential areas were originally named Kingston Park, Kenton Bank Foot, Tudor Grange and Ouseburn Park, although over time all of these have come to be known collectively as Kingston Park. Most of the housing to the south of Kingston Park Metro station was built by developers such as Leech and originally sold on a leasehold basis. Some of the housing to the north of the station was built as council owned rented properties, although many were bought by tenants under the Government's right-to-buy scheme. Further housing development is planned on the fringes of Kingston Park at Kenton Bank Foot and Callerton, in areas removed from the Green Belt as part of the Core Strategy and Urban Core plan. = Shopping and business = Aside from Tesco Extra, other stores on the Kingston Retail Park include, Boots, Carphone Warehouse, Currys PC World, Greggs, Halfords, Iceland Food Warehouse, Marks & Spencer, Matalan, McDonald's, Sports Direct, Next, Pets at Home, Poundland, T.K. Maxx and William Hill. Newer stores now include EE, Domino's Pizza, Costa Coffee, B & M and Superdrug, the latter which opened recently in February 2020. Prior to the building of the Tesco Extra, which opened in November 1999, there was an older Tesco on the opposite side of the car park, and Metro stations for a number of years. It was built in a 1980s red brick barn style, which opened on 15 June 1988, and was demolished in 2002. There was also a Presto, in the Kingston Park Shopping Centre, which later became a branch of Netto. Until December 2012, Comet had been present, until the company entered administration. Poundland moved into the store in 2013. The Airport Industrial Estate is also located in Kingston Park.  Kingston Park stadium  The area houses the Kingston Park Stadium, which is home to the Newcastle Falcons rugby union team, and also hosts the home football fixtures of Newcastle United's reserve team. The Falcons, then known as Newcastle Gosforth, moved into Kingston Park Stadium in 1990; prior to this, the site had been the Newcastle Chronicle and Journal Sports Ground.  Transport  Kingston Park also has a Tyne and Wear Metro station, with direct services to Newcastle Airport, Newcastle City Centre, Gateshead and Sunderland. It was opened on 15 September 1985, four years after the Metro line had begun service.  Schools  Kingston Park Primary School is based in Kingston Park. There are about 350 pupils from Nursery to Year 6. The school has won many awards, which include, Charter Mark, Sport England & Healthy School. The school also have many clubs, which include football and netball, to chess and creative writing. The school also has an \\"Eco Council\\", to help the environment in the school grounds. The majority of Year 6 pupils go up to Kenton School. = Youth groups = There are several youth groups in and around the area of Kingston Park. One such group is 733 (Newcastle Airport) Squadron of the Air Training Corps (ATC).

She is primarily known for her best-selling epic \\"...And Ladies of the Club\\", published when she was in her 80s. Life and career =Early life and education= Santmyer was born on November 25, 1895, in Cincinnati, Ohio, the oldest child of Joseph Wright and Bertha Hooven Santmyer. Her father had been a medical student in Cincinnati, but in 1900 switched to business and moved to the Hooven family home in Xenia, taking a position with the R.A. Kelly Company, a rope manufacturer. Inspired by Louisa May Alcott, Santmyer was determined to become a writer and kept a diary from age 10. She also derived inspiration from her grandfathers; both were veterans of the American Civil War and would relate stories of their service. She furthermore derived negative inspiration from her mother, who she felt sacrificed a promising career as an artist for the sake of marriage and children, and was determined never to marry. As a child, Santmyer had a severe case of undulant fever. She recovered, but was left weakened for life, and sometimes subject to bed confinement with fevers or a heart flutter. She would always find it difficult to work and write at the same time. She was brought up Presbyterian. Her mother and grandmother were regular church attendees. In later years, she no longer believed in doctrine, and did not attend services. She attended Wellesley College 1914-18 and was active in the struggle for women's rights; she began publishing her poetry as an undergraduate.See, for example, #External links The 1916 Alfred Noyes edited collection, A Book of Princeton Verse (poems by Princeton students), was widely read in Santmyer's circle, and strongly influenced her. She quit her clubs and committees and wrote a manifesto that appeared in The Wellesley College Magazine, May 1917, criticizing women who do not dedicate themselves to their art, the way she presumed men did. After graduation, Santmeyer took a job as an editorial secretary with Scribner's in New York City for two years. She returned to Xenia, teaching locally and at Wellesley College, during which time she wrote her first novel, Herbs and Apples, based on her life in Xenia, college, and working for Scribner's. After Wellesley, Santmyer attended Oxford University in England for three years, 1924-27\\\\. During her time there, she met and befriended a fellow Xenian, the poet Ridgely Torrence. She wrote a thesis on 17th-century women writers, focusing largely on Clara Reeve, who lived in the 18th and 19th centuries. Culminating her studies at Oxford, Santmyer was awarded a B.Litt. degree. After finishing at Oxford, Santmyer returned to Xenia. In 1927, she befriended Mildred Sandoe, a librarian, who would become her long-term friend, companion, and literary assistant. In 1928, she joined the Xenia Woman's Club. During this time she wrote her second novel, The Fierce Dispute, published in 1929. In the summer of 1930, Santmyer became a MacDowell colonist. There, she wrote her third novel, Farewell, Summer (published posthumously) and befriended actor and playwright Daniel Reed and novelist Thornton Wilder. The Depression forced the closure of the rope factory where Santmyer's father worked. He found employment in Orange County, California, the house was sold, and the family relocated to the West Coast. While in California, Santmyer started writing Ohio Town and Ladies. But after three years, her father retired due to failing health. Santmyer and her parents returned to near Xenia. =Main career= In 1935, she accepted the positions as Dean of Women and English department head at Cedarville College, then chartered as a Reformed Presbyterian college. During this time her writing continued, but because of her health, very slowly. In 1953, Cedarville College was purchased by a Baptist association, which demanded faculty to adhere to their Biblical literalism, and did not permit smoking or drinking. Santmyer resigned from the faculty. Santmyer and her parents moved back to the former Hooven family home, which had been repurchased by her brother-in-law. Santmyer's friend Sandoe, then working at the Dayton Public Library, found a position there for Santmyer as a research librarian, and provided the daily commute. Santmyer's father died in 1954, and her mother died in 1955. Sandoe then moved into the Santmyer house. =Retirement and main writing= Upon retirement in 1959, Santmyer returned to full-time writing, publishing Ohio Town, reminiscences of Xenia, in 1962 with Ohio State University Press. The director of OSU Press encouraged her to publish with them again. Santmyer then wrote the bulk of Ladies, submitting it to OSU Press in 1976, which accepted it, but required heavy abridgment. Also as of 1976, Santmyer had the first of several stays in Hospitality Home East, a Xenia nursing home, where most of the revision was done. In 1982, \\"...And Ladies of the Club\\" was published obscurely by OSU Press: it was the publisher's second novel, there was no separate advertising budget, and only a few hundred copies of the book were sold, mostly to Ohio libraries. By April 1983, nearly blind and suffering from emphysema, Santmyer moved permanently into the nursing home. By chance, the novel ended up being read by some in the Hollywood entertainment industry who saw its potential for a larger audience. This led to the book's republication by Putnam in 1984 and its becoming a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club. Both Santmyer and the novel subsequently received considerable media attention with the novel becoming a best-seller. Santmyer died at the age of 90 on February 21, 1986. The former Hooven family home on 113 West 3rd Street, Xenia, has been marked with an Ohio Historical Marker by the Ohio Historical Connection.

It was originally broadcast on ITV on 10 July 1983 as fourth in an untitled series of works by Leland (including Birth of a Nation), loosely based on the British educational system, which subsequently acquired the overall title of Tales Out of School. As with many Alan Clarke works, the director attempts to depict English working-class life realistically, without moralising or complex plots. The play features strong language, violence, racism and an anti- establishment feeling. Cinematographer Chris Menges's use of the Steadicam contributed to the fluid and gritty atmosphere of the play.\\"DVD Outsider: Made In Britain Synopsis and Review\\". Retrieved on 25 June 2008. Plot The play begins with a defiant Trevor being tried in court charged with throwing a brick through the window of a Pakistani man, Mr. Shahnawaz. He has also been charged with shoplifting from Harrods. Trevor's social worker, Harry Parker (Eric Richard) takes him to Hooper Street Residential Assessment Centre, where his punishment will be determined. The centre's deputy superintendent, Peter Clive (Bill Stewart), admits Trevor, and he's allocated a room with Errol (Terry Richards). The next day, Trevor leaves the assessment centre, to look for jobs. Trevor, accompanied by Errol, breaks into a car and drives to the job centre. Near the job centre, he buys Evo-Stik for huffing,\\"Channel 4: Made In Britain Review\\". Retrieved on 25 June 2008.\\"BFI Screenonline: Made In Britain Synopsis\\".

When asked to wait, he storms out, and hurls a brick through the window. He makes his escape, and walks with Errol to an abandoned swimming pool where he has hidden some tools. Trevor pockets the tools, and hands Errol a bunch of keys, instructing him to get it into the centre, and hide it. He then breaks into another car, and takes it and drives away. He orders Errol to get out, saying he is visiting some mates. Later, Trevor is eating a burger in the car. Peter Clive arrives and notices Trevor in the car. Trevor discards the sandwich and walks into the assessment centre. Peter Clive tells him to get rid of the car. Trevor agrees. Inside the assessment centre, Trevor refuses to co-operate. He demands lunch, only to be informed that he is too late. In a rage, he tries kicking down the cafeteria door. The chef (Jim Dunk) rushes out, only to be kicked in the groin by Trevor, who unleashes a vicious attack on him, before being stopped by care worker Barry Giller (Sean Chapman). Trevor is then held down by the chef and Barry, and locked up in a room.Grunert, Andrea. \\"Emotion and Cognition: About Some Key-Figures in Films by Alan Clarke \\". Artbrain.

Trevor refuses to keep the peace, and eventually Barry and Peter decide to send him to a secure unit. However, while Barry is out making arrangements to send Trevor away, Peter offers to take Trevor banger racing if he promises to behave. Trevor accepts the offer, on condition that he be allowed to drive. Peter informs Barry about the change of plans, and warns Trevor that he is doing him a favour by giving him another chance, and that if Trevor lets him down, he'll team up with the chef and some of the biggest lads in the centre to beat up Trevor. They go to the races as planned and Trevor is given a chance to drive, as promised. Trevor seems to enjoy the experience, but gets into an accident, after which his car will not restart. Trevor is unable to complete the race. On the drive back to the assessment centre, Peter informs Trevor that he was up against professional racers and did well. He also tells him that he could join a racing team if he wished, and need not go around stealing cars any longer. Trevor makes no reply, and blankly stares out the window. They reach the assessment centre late and have to be let in by the janitor, since Peter cannot find his keys. After everybody has retired to bed, Trevor wakes up Errol and shows him Peter Clive's keys, which Trevor claims to have picked up after Peter dropped them. Trevor and Errol make their way into the office, where Trevor rummages through the documents until he finds their respective files. Trevor reads through Errol's reports and contract, and finds a report titled \\"The Future\\", which reads: > It seems unlikely for this child to return home, his mother having rejected > him for her own lifestyle.

They reach Mr. Shahnawaz's neighbourhood and hurl stones through the windows, and scream racial slurs. They get into the van and drive away. Trevor drives to a police station, and smashes the van into a car. Errol is rendered unconscious by the impact. Trevor exits the van and runs away, leaving Errol to be apprehended by the police. Trevor begins walking to Harry Parker's apartment. On his way, Trevor looks into a shop window displaying a television, clothes, mannequins, and other items. He stares at them and their accompanying price tags, intently. He begins running into a tunnel, and screams \\"Bollocks!\\" Inside the tunnel, he discards his T-shirt, and screams at a passing vehicle after trying to kick it. Trevor walks past a school, presumably his, pausing to gaze through the iron gates before continuing on his way. It is early morning by the time Trevor reaches Harry Parker's home. Harry is busy packing, and is preparing to leave on a holiday with his family. He is displeased to see Trevor in this state. He tells him to go back to the assessment centre before it is too late. Trevor informs Harry of his misadventures, and tells him that he is turning himself in. Harry eventually makes the necessary calls to the police. Trevor is seen in a prison cell, pressing the buzzer in the room. The police officer orders him to keep his hands off the buzzer. Trevor walks away, but returns and proceeds to press the buzzer with his head. This time, another officer, PC Anson (Christopher Fulford) enters, with a truncheon. He orders Trevor to stay quiet, but Trevor continues to provoke him, saying that he is a juvenile offender, and that he must be taken care of and sent back to the assessment centre. Anson orders him to shut up and sit down. He tells Trevor that he would be taken to court in a few days, and this time he will end up in a detention centre or a borstal, not an assessment centre. He threatens to have his fingerprints taken as soon as he leaves the borstal, and use them to convict him of every unsolved taking and driving away in the district, dating back months. Trevor is still unfazed and sarcastically sneers \\"Sounds great!\\" Anson is livid, and brings the truncheon down, hitting Trevor on the kneecap. PC Anson smiles and says, 'You think you're hard, don't you?' Trevor, for the first time, looks defeated. He slumps in agony and shock, his face reddening. The warder tells Trevor that he is all talk, and decries his protests, saying that he has no choice but to respect authority and obey the rules, like everybody else. The play ends with Trevor recovering from the pain and grinning, as the warders shut the door of his cell.

Anson Production After successful collaborations on previous projects like Beloved Enemy and Psy-Warriors, writer David Leland and director Alan Clarke were keen to team up again. Producer Margaret Matheson, whom had worked with both Leland and Clarke before (most notably on the original version of Scum (television play)) was taking over as Head of Drama at the-then newly created Central Television. Matheson was keen to develop a project about education and a series of 4 one-off plays eventually broadcast under the umbrella title \\"Tales Out Of School\\" was commissioned. David Leland, when interviewed in 1998, recalled that Clarke was initially reluctant to commit to the directing duties of Made In Britain- \\"he was trying then to do Contact; his mind was elsewhere [...] it was only because we were friends, we could meet and talk about Made In Britain.\\" Made In Britain is notable as one of the first British television dramas (and Clarke's first production) to make use of the steadicam. Fellow director Stephen Frears, who at that point was in the process of editing his film Walter, noted that his cameraman on that project- Chris Menges- was a \\"huge influence\\" on Clarke using the steadicam. Recalling the filming process in a 1998 interview, he noted that \\"Made In Britain was written very powerfully, and it had these rather long sequences which posed certain technical problems [...] he [Clarke] found a piece of equipment that liberated him from that.\\" Clarke became so enamored with the technical properties of the steadicam that it would be used repeatedly throughout the rest of his filmed work throughout the 1980s, most notably on the BBC dramas Christine (1986), Road (1987), Elephant and The Firm (both 1989). Former BBC director of plays Chris Morahan noted that \\"Steadicam was the trigger for his creativity.\\" Despite being a production relatively free of complications, problems arose with the filming of the original ending. As scripted, the final shot of the production was to feature Trevor, now confined to a borstal, digging trenches in the backyard with all the other inmates and encouraging them to 'dig for Britain'. As David Leland noted in a 2016 interview accompanying the re-release of the play for Tales Out Of School DVD collection, \\"I'm a country boy...I assumed everyone knew what trenching was.\\" Director Clarke misunderstood the directions in the script, resulting in a scene where the borstal inmates are digging seemingly randomly placed holes. Deemed unsatisfactory and with insufficient funds to re-film it, the televised film closes on a freeze-frame of Trevor's grinning face in police custody. Screenshots and script directions from the original ending are enclosed on the aforementioned DVD. Music The music in the opening scene is the song \\"UK82\\" by Scottish punk rock band The Exploited. The album Council Estate of Mind by Skinnyman extensively samples the dialogue of the film.

It is a small reddish liverwort and can be confused with Marsupella sprucei which has a more widespread distribution. Distribution and habitat The species is rare in Britain; it is known from just ten locations, all in Cornwall. These sites at Lower Bostraze and Leswidden, St Austell Clay Pits and Tregonning Hill, are all protected as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Within Cornwall, western rustwort is generally found growing on micaceous or clay waste substrates which are flat or gently sloping. Some patches occur on granitic rocks, usually where these are soft or crumbling. It appears to be a pioneer species, the largest populations being found on surfaces showing the early stages of colonisation by other bryophytes and by vascular plants. New plants develop and grow rapidly from spores, while older plants disappear as they are shaded out by surrounding vegetation. It disappeared from at least six Cornish sites between 1971 and 2005 due to shading from European gorse (Ulex europaeus) and bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg.) Conservation This liverwort is rare in all parts of its range and is known from only a few sites in each locality where it is present. The species has several conservation designations. It is listed on Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, in Appendix 1 of the Bern Convention, and as a 'priority species' in Annex II of the European Community Habitats and Species Directive (1992).

It was nominated for an Oscar. A water park based on the book was opened in 2016 in the town of Nipigon, where the fictional journey begins. Paddle-to-the-sea Park  Plot  At Lake Nipigon, Ontario, a First Nation boy carves a wooden model of an ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù in a canoe. On its side he roughly carves the words \\"Please put me back in the water. I am Paddle-to-the-Sea\\" and sets it free to travel the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. The story follows the progress of the little wooden canoe and paddler on their journey. It travels the Nipigon River wedged in a log of wood, and is rescued by a French-Canadian lumberjack just as it is going under the saw. He puts it back in the water. It is picked up several more times, but the inscription is always obeyed. At one point, a man finds the inscription very worn and adds a metal plate bearing similar words. As the canoe travels, those who send it on its way scratch their locations on the metal plate. It traverses all five Great Lakes (including going over Niagara Falls) and the St. Lawrence River. Finally after many years it arrives off Newfoundland at the Atlantic Ocean. There it is retrieved for the last time in the nets of a French trawler on the Grand Banks, and is taken to France. Its long journey is written up in a French newspaper. A copy arrives at the sawmill on the Nipigon River, sent from France by the cousin of the lumberjack. By chance, the original maker, now a grown man, is working there as a local guide and he also sees the newspaper. He recognizes his handiwork, but does not draw attention to it, and the book ends with his words of pride, spoken only to himself. Each movement of the canoe is celebrated by a short chapter, suitable for reading aloud to a child and decorated with black-and-white sketches and at least one full-page watercolor, all by the author. The sketches accompany the larger story and tell smaller narrative stories of their own: for example, one sketch demonstrates how a sawmill works by visually outlining the progress of a log of timber towards a mechanical saw.

The novel, which looks at the club as it changes throughout the years, spans decades in the lives of the women involved in the club, between 1868 and 1932. Many characters are introduced in the course of the novel, but the primary characters are Anne Gordon and Sally Rausch, who in 1868 are new graduates of the Waynesboro Female College. They marry soon after the opening of the book, and the decades that follow chronicle their marriages and those of their children and grandchildren. Santmyer focuses not just on the lives of the women in the club, but also their families, friends, politics, and developments in their small town and the larger world. Synopsis On the day of their graduation from the Waynesboro Female College in 1868, best friends Anne Alexander and Sarah \\"Sally\\" Cochran are invited along with several of the college's female teachers by Mrs. Lowrey, who along with her professor husband operates the college, to become founding members of a new local society, the Waynesboro Woman's Club. The club is intended to promote culture and literature among the educated citizens of the Ohio town, while avoiding controversial subjects such as women's suffrage and other reform movements. Socially ambitious Sally agrees to join because she believes the club might become important in the town, and wants to establish herself as a serious-minded member of adult society. Introspective Anne, the class valedictorian, joins in order to support Sally. Other early members of the Club include Miss Louisa Tucker, a beautiful but cold mathematics teacher who later marries the commencement speaker General Deming; scholarly Amanda Reid, who overcame a poor background to earn a degree from Oberlin and has returned to teach at the Female College; Miss Agatha Pinney, an elderly teacher whose sciatica leads to a secret addiction to the laudanum she is prescribed; Mary, Thomasina and Eliza Ballard, the wife and daughters of a prominent local judge; and the Misses Gardiner, two reclusive spinsters whose nephew, Douglas, attends Princeton and becomes a local attorney and judge. The club's membership grows over time to include the daughters, granddaughters, and other relatives of the early members, and other society women, particularly the wives of the town's numerous and often-changing Protestant ministers. Although the club itself is framed as non-controversial, club meetings and social events sponsored by its members often lead to discussions and conflicts stemming from the widely varying social and political views of the members and their families on subjects such as race, class, ethnic and religious biases, women's rights, labor reform, and the morality of drinking alcohol, attending the theater and celebrating Christmas. Anne, the daughter of a doctor, is in love with Dr. John \\"Dock\\" Gordon, her father's protege and a friend of her late brother Rob who was killed in the Civil War. Depressed by his war experiences, John gave up his medical practice for several years, but with Anne's encouragement resumes his practice and the two marry. Anne's father consents to the match, but warns her that John is too affected by the suffering he sees as a doctor and that he is likely to make a poor husband, so Anne will have to be very tolerant. Sally develops a relationship with John's friend Captain Ludwig Rausch, who has bought a small local rope-making business and begun building it into a large, updated factory. Although Ludwig is a German immigrant, his ambitions match Sally's and her banker father, approving of his work ethic and prospects, agrees to their marriage. Thomasina Ballard also makes an unexpected marriage to a church organist as a result of a wedding poem she wrote for Anne. Over the years, Anne and Sally continue their club activities while raising families. Anne and John have a son, Johnny, and a daughter, Binny; Sally and Ludwig have a daughter, Elsa, and several sons. Although John is an intelligent and caring doctor, he is secretly unfaithful to Anne as a way of relieving the pressure of his past war memories and current responsibilities. Anne eventually finds out, and suspects that John has even fathered a child with his cousin Jessamine Stevens in New Orleans. Although deeply hurt by John's behavior, Anne, remembering her father's advice, chooses to overlook it and even welcomes Jessamine and her son when they later move to Waynesboro. Meanwhile, Ludwig becomes a successful industrialist and Sally a prominent local hostess, later taking over the presidency of the club. Ludwig hires Eliza Ballard as his secretary after she is forced to leave her previous position in her late father's former law firm due to gossiping about partner Doug Gardiner's romance with an Irish Catholic girl whom he later marries. Despite Eliza's gossip and sharp tongue occasionally causing trouble in the town, she shows a softer side by caring for Ariana McCune, a terminally ill young girl who ran away from her oppressively religious parents. Miss Pinney's laudanum addiction eventually becomes public knowledge after she appears increasingly disheveled and unable to control her primary school class. At the instigation of Louisa Deming, Miss Pinney is forced to retire on a small pension and her laudanum supply is cut off. Embarrassed and suffering severe withdrawal, she dies of a heart attack while trying to burn herself to death. Elsa secretly loves her childhood friend Johnny, but Johnny falls in love with the Demings' daughter Julia, who like her mother is beautiful but cold. Julia is more affectionate towards Johnny's younger sister Binny, who is dazzled by Julia's beauty. Binny gathers violets on a cold damp morning to make Julia a May basket, and is rewarded by a kiss from Julia, but the dampness brings on an attack of rheumatic fever and Binny dies. Johnny and Julia marry and have a son, Tucker, while Elsa marries Gib Evans and has a daughter, Jennifer, who becomes Tucker's close friend. Shortly after the turn of the century, Anne is widowed when John has an accident rushing to help a patient in bad weather, and subsequently dies of pneumonia. Julia's frigidity causes Johnny to have an affair with his Irish Catholic nurse, Norah O'Neill. Through Johnny, Norah's younger sister Ellen meets Ludwig and Sally's youngest son Paul. Ellen and Paul have a secret romance and Ellen becomes pregnant, resulting in Paul quietly marrying her with Ludwig's consent since he is underage. Although Paul and Ellen are happy, Sally disapproves of the marriage, cuts ties with her son and, in response to a barbed remark by Julia's mother Louisa, informs her about Johnny's affair with Norah. As a result, Julia divorces Johnny, moves to California with Tucker, and later marries a wealthy older man who is past the age of having sex. Johnny, suffering from heart disease and the strain of the divorce, soon dies. Anne and the other members of the club are unaware that Sally was the one who revealed Johnny's affair to Louisa, and instead think Eliza spread the story. Sally eventually is reconciled with Paul after he and his family survive a devastating flood. Ludwig dies and his daughter Elsa takes over as president of the family-owned bank; she also succeeds her mother as president of the club. Elsa's son Ludwig takes control of his grandfather's company after returning from his service in the Great War, where he was gassed. Tucker, separated from Jennifer by his parents' divorce, meets her again as an adult when they are both serving in France in the war, he as a medical corpsman and she as a nurse. After the war, they marry, and Tucker becomes a doctor and returns to take up his practice in Waynesboro. By the 1930s, Sally is suffering from arteriosclerosis and asks Elsa to bring Anne so that she can confess to Anne that she was the one who revealed Johnny's affair. Elsa talks her out of doing so, noting that Anne is happy with the company of Tucker, Jennifer and their children. As a result, Sally has a farewell visit with Anne but does not mention the situation involving Johnny. Sally dies soon afterwards. In 1932, right after Franklin D. Roosevelt is elected president, Anne, the last surviving founding member of the club, dies and the Club commemorates the end of an era.

Background =Writing= From 1922‚Äì1930, Santmyer wrote three novels. The first two were published to little notice and the third was unpublished. She disliked Sinclair Lewis's negative portrayal of small town America in his novel, Main Street, and conceived of Ladies as an antidote. However, since she worked full-time, she was unable to write very much before her retirement in 1959. A collection of her nostalgic reminiscences of Xenia, Ohio was published as Ohio Town by Ohio State University Press in 1962. The director of the Press, Weldon Kefauver, encouraged her to write more. In 1976 she submitted eleven boxes containing bookkeeping ledgers, her manuscript of Ladies in longhand. Kefauver accepted the novel, but wanted it trimmed. By then, Santmyer was spending much of her time in a nursing home and she dictated changes to her friend Mildred Sandoe. The Press published the novel, printed 1500 copies and sold a few hundred, priced at $35, mostly to libraries. In 1983, Santmyer was forced for health reasons to move permanently into a nursing home. Ladies was awarded the 1983 Ohioana Book Award in the category of fiction, but otherwise gained little attention at the time. =Success= One local library patron, in returning the book, told the librarian that it was the greatest novel she had ever read. Another patron, Grace Sindell, overheard this and checked the book out herself. After reading it, she agreed with the assessment and called her son Gerald in Hollywood. He was at first reluctant to look at the book, believing that anything that was that good would already be taken. Unable to find a copy in California, he ordered one directly from the publisher and agreed that it had great potential. He convinced his Hollywood friend Stanley Corwin of the same and the two purchased movie, TV and republication rights. They then convinced Putnam to republish the book. Before republication, the Book-of-the-Month club chose Ladies as their main selection. Suddenly, Santmyer and her novel were a media sensation, including front-page coverage in the New York Times. The paperback edition, published by Berkley in 1985, sold more than 2 million copies between June and September, making it the best-selling paperback in history at the time. Reception Most reviews were enthusiastic. A few were grudging and even hostile.

Queer theology begins with an assumption that gender non-conformity and gay, lesbian and bisexual desire have always been present in human history, including the Bible. It was at one time separated into two separate theologies; gay theology and lesbian theology. Later, the two would merge to become the more inclusive term of queer theology.  Terminology  The term queer can be understood within queer theory as encompassing one of three meanings: as an umbrella term, as transgressive action, and as erasing boundaries. Building upon these three meanings of queer, queer theology can be understood as: # Theology done by and for LGBTQIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual) individuals focusing on their specific needs. # Theology that purposefully opposes social and cultural norms regarding gender and sexuality. It seeks to unearth hidden voices or hidden perspectives that allows theology to be seen in a new light. # Theology that challenges and deconstructs boundaries, particularly with respect to sexual and gender identity. Queer theology is inclusive to individuals' sexual and gender identity and allows the LGBTQ+ community to reclaim their space in Christianity. Furthermore, according to Jennifer Purvis, \\"queer\\" signifies not only a range of variant genders and non-heterosexual sexualities, but a posture of resistance, questioning attitude, and a set of techniques and approaches. For that reason, queer theology calls on us to think beyond what may be known, disciplined and controlled and asks us to re-embrace our queer cognizance. The term can be traced back to the 1990s, when J. Michael Clark proposed the term \\"pro- feminist gay theology\\" and Robert Goss used the term \\"queer theology.\\"  Theologians  = Hugh William Montefiore's views on Jesus' early life = In a paper read at the Conference of Modern Churchmen in 1967 titled \\"Jesus, the Revelation of God\\", Hugh William Montefiore offers a controversial interpretation of the early life of Jesus. Jesus was not aware of his vocation as Messiah until approximately age thirty, Montefiore argues, and this vocation can therefore not explain the celibacy of Jesus. Apart from the Essenes, celibacy was not a common practice in Jewish life. Montefiore suggests we might need to look for a non-religious reason to explain the celibacy of Jesus: > Men usually remain unmarried for three reasons: either because they cannot > afford to marry or there are no girls to marry (neither of these factors > need have deterred Jesus); or because it is inexpedient for them to marry in > the light of their vocation (we have already ruled this out during the > \\"hidden years\\" of Jesus' life); or because they are homosexual in nature, in > as much as women hold no special attraction for them. The homosexual > explanation is one which we must not ignore.H. W. Montefiore, ‚ÄúJesus, the > Revelation of God,‚Äù in Christ for Us Today: Papers read at the Conference of > Modern Churchmen, Somerville College, Oxford, July 1967, edited by Norman > Pittenger (SCM Press, London: 1968), p. 109. Montefiore finds the explanation that Jesus was homosexual consistent with his identification with the poor and oppressed: > All the synoptic gospels show Jesus in close relationship with the > ‚Äòoutsiders‚Äô and the unloved. Publicans and sinners, prostitutes and > criminals are among his acquaintances and companions. If Jesus were > homosexual in nature (and this is the true explanation of his celibate > state) then this would be further evidence of God‚Äôs self-identification with > those who are unacceptable to the upholders of ‚ÄòThe Establishment‚Äô and > social conventions.ibid, p. 110. = Marcella Althaus-Reid = One proponent of queer theology was Marcella Althaus-Reid, who drew on Latin American liberation theology and interpreted the Bible in a way in which she saw as positive towards women, queer people and sex.\\"Dr. Marcella Althaus-Reid\\", Religious Archives Network (on line). She proposed a theology that centered marginalized people, including people in poverty and queer people. For Althaus-Reid, theology ought to be connected to the body and lived experience. She put it this way: One theme in the theology of her The Queer God (Routledge, 2003) is the holiness of the gay club, as she explores the intersection and essential non-contradiction of a strong, vibrant faith life and sexual desire.Marcella Althaus-Reid, The Queer God (Routledge: 2003). .Jay Emerson Johnson. A \\"Queer God\\"? Really? Remembering Marcella Althaus-Reid\\". Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies, Pacific School of Religion (March 5, 2009) -- on line. An example of finding otherness and desire in Biblical texts is her reading of Jeremiah 2:23‚Äì25 from the Hebrew, presented in her previous work Indecent Theology: = John J. McNeill = John J. McNeill was an openly gay Jesuit priest and a vocal proponent of queer theology. His work focuses on the pushing of a new and evolving Christian structure that is truly inclusive of gay, lesbian and bisexual Christians. He highlights the importance of acknowledging how far Christian mentality has come in its view of homosexuality but believes there is a long way to go. McNeill argues that it is not enough to demand acceptance but to strive for a Church that provides a community that allows for the spiritual and moral enrichment of gay, lesbian and bisexual Christians. This inclusion can be achieved by engaging with and allowing gay, lesbian and bisexual Christians to not only participate in such a community but be leaders in the ministry. > Homosexuals within the Church have an obligation to organize and attempt to > enter into dialogue with Church authorities. Church authorities in turn > should show an example in terms of just behavior toward the homosexual > minority by displaying an active willingness to hear, to enter dialogue, and > to seek ways to resolve whatever injustice becomes clear as a result of > dialogue. It is only by means of such a dialogue that the process can begin > of separating the true implications of Christian faith and morality for the > homosexual from the misunderstandings and prejudices of the past. McNeill's book The Church and the Homosexual (Beacon Press, 1976) addresses queer theology in three sections: a history of the relationship between homosexuality and the Catholic tradition, finding where homosexuality belongs in a restructured traditional moral theology, and the shifts necessary in the modern Christian ministry that will allow gay, lesbian and bisexual Christians to thrive in their faith.

The town is the southernmost officially recognized Inuit community in the world. Located on Hamilton Inlet, which is at the entrance to fresh water Lake Melville; Rigolet is on salt water and is accessible to navigation during the winter. Although there is no road access, the community is accessible by snowmobile trail, the Rigolet Airport, or seasonally via a coastal ferry (MV Kamutik W) from Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Fur trader in Rigolet, 1911 The Hudson Bay Company established its trading post in Rigolet in 1836. The Hudson Bay Company remained an active part of the community until 1987 when it was bought by the North West Company and was renamed the \\"Northern Store\\". Rigolet is part of the Labrador Inuit Land Claims area and is overseen by the Nunatsiavut government. Approximately 5% of Rigolet's population is non Inuit. Although there are still coniferous trees surrounding the village, a few kilometres northeast into Hamilton Inlet, the terrain changes drastically to a sub-arctic tundra. Minke and humpback whales are commonly observed in nearby waters. In John Wyndham's post-apocalyptic novel The Chrysalids, set at an unspecified future date, Rigolet has become the town of Rigo and the capital of Labrador (which is one of the few habitable areas left in North America). Rigolet is home to the longest boardwalk in North America. Rigolet's boardwalk stretches over 8 kms, from Rigolet to Double Mer Point. The first phase of the boardwalk was completed in 1997 and the last extension of the boardwalk was completed in 2015.

While a single filter can be used individually, they are frequently strung together to form a pipeline. Some operating systems such as Unix are rich with filter programs. Windows 7 and later are also rich with filters, as they include Windows PowerShell. In comparison, however, few filters are built into cmd.exe (the original command-line interface of Windows), most of which have significant enhancements relative to the similar filter commands that were available in MS-DOS. OS X includes filters from its underlying Unix base but also has Automator, which allows filters (known as \\"Actions\\") to be strung together to form a pipeline. Unix In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, a filter is a program that gets most of its data from its standard input (the main input stream) and writes its main results to its standard output (the main output stream). Auxiliary input may come from command line flags or configuration files, while auxiliary output may go to standard error. The command syntax for getting data from a device or file other than standard input is the input operator (\`<\`). Similarly, to send data to a device or file other than standard output is the output operator (\`>\`). To append data lines to an existing output file, one can use the append operator (\`>>\`). Filters may be strung together into a pipeline with the pipe operator (\\"\`\`\\"). This operator signifies that the main output of the command to the left is passed as main input to the command on the right. The Unix philosophy encourages combining small, discrete tools to accomplish larger tasks. The classic filter in Unix is Ken Thompson's , which Doug McIlroy cites as what \\"ingrained the tools outlook irrevocably\\" in the operating system, with later tools imitating it. at its simplest prints any lines containing a character string to its output. The following is an example: cut -d : -f 1 /etc/passwd  grep foo This finds all registered users that have \\"foo\\" as part of their username by using the cut command to take the first field (username) of each line of the Unix system password file and passing them all as input to grep, which searches its input for lines containing the character string \\"foo\\" and prints them on its output. Common Unix filter programs are: cat, cut, grep, head, sort, uniq, and tail. Programs like awk and sed can be used to build quite complex filters because they are fully programmable. Unix filters can also be used by Data scientists to get a quick overview about a file based dataset.Data Analysis with the Unix Shell - Bernd Zuther, comSysto GmbH, 2013 =List of Unix filter programs= *awk *cat *comm *cut *expand *compress *fold *grep *head *less *more *nl *perl *paste *pr *sed *sh *sort *split *strings *tail *tac *tee *tr *uniq *wc *zcat DOS Two standard filters from the early days of DOS-based computers are find and sort. Examples: find \\"keyword\\" < inputfilename > outputfilename sort \\"keyword\\" < inputfilename > outputfilename find /v \\"keyword\\" < inputfilename  sort > outputfilename Such filters may be used in batch files (*.bat, *.cmd etc.). For use in the same command shell environment, there are many more filters available than those built into Windows. Some of these are freeware, some shareware and some are commercial programs. A number of these mimic the function and features of the filters in Unix. Some filtering programs have a graphical user interface (GUI) to enable users to design a customized filter to suit their special data processing and/or data mining requirements. Windows Windows Command Prompt inherited MS-DOS commands, improved some and added a few. For example, Windows Server 2003 features six command-line filters for modifying Active Directory that can be chained by piping: DSAdd, DSGet, DSMod, DSMove, DSRm and DSQuery. Windows PowerShell adds an entire host of filters known as \\"cmdlets\\" which can be chained together with a pipe, except a few simple ones, e.g. \`Clear-Screen\`. The following example gets a list of files in the \`C:\\\\Windows\` folder, gets the size of each and sorts the size in ascending order. It shows how three filters (\`Get-ChildItem\`, \`ForEach-Object\` and \`Sort-Object\`) are chained with pipes.

Port Hardy has a population of 4,132 at the last census (2016). It is the gateway to Cape Scott Provincial Park, the North Coast Trail and the BC Marine Trail, located on the northernmost tip of Vancouver Island. The community has access to spectacular wilderness adventures, such as kayaking, caving, world-class scuba diving, nature viewing, surfing, unique saltwater rapids, fishing and camping. Port Hardy's twin city is Numata, Japan. Naming Port Hardy was named after Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy who served as the captain of H.M.S. Victory. He served at the Battle of Trafalgar when Nelson died in his arms. Filomi Days Once a year, Port Hardy holds a celebration in Rotary Park to acknowledge its natural resource based economy. The three syllables, fi, lo and mi, stand for \\"fishing, logging and mining\\". The celebration includes festivities in the park such as activities for children, fundraising concessions, entertainment, beer gardens, bake sales, craft sales, and fireworks. A dance for each age group and a parade are also held on Filomi Days weekend- typically the third weekend in July. Brookes Laidlaw represents the current Vice Admiral in the annual parade. Tourism Port Hardy's economy relies greatly on tourism. Ferries to Prince Rupert, another popular tourist destination in British Columbia, depart every other day during peak season. Tourist traffic in the summer is immense, and hotels and restaurants usually find themselves with no room to accommodate all travellers. Wildlife A deer near the Quatse river Deer, black bears, bald eagles, squirrels, seals, salmon and many other species of birds and mammals are often spotted along the Quatse Loop Nature Trail or at Storey's Beach which is a short drive from town. Humpback whales can occasionally been seen surfacing in the bay. Port Hardy has many wildlife charters, fishing charters and places to camp during tourist season. Climate Port Hardy has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen Cfb) due to its proximity to the Pacific moderating influence. As a result, summers are very cool for the latitude, whereas winters instead are very mild.

In the city of Maumere, the center of the region, Sika people occupy a separate block. The Sika language, which is a member of the Timor-Ambon language family, is spoken by the Sika people. The Sika language have at least three recognized dialects, namely Sikka Natar dialect, Sara Krowe dialect and Ata Tana 'Ai or Sara Tana 'Ai dialect. History =Timorese Sika= A group of mestizo from Sikka and Europeans settled in 1851 as a voluntary recruits from the UK according to Sikka Dili over in Portuguese Timor. In that year, the Portuguese government had Jos√© Joaquim Lopes de Lima to sign a treaty with the Netherlands concluded that the west of Timor, Flores island and other areas of the Lesser Sunda Islands are ceded to them. This agreement was later confirmed by the Treaty of Lisbon in 1859. The Sika people are formed in addition to the Bidau and Moradores as one of the three people groups that make up the Portuguese Armed Forces in the colony. All three ethnic groups lived in separate districts of the capital. As for language they still retained their original Malay language, but later switched to a Creole Portuguese. Today they have been absorbed into the same population and do not form their own distinct group anymore. Religion The primary religion practiced by the Sika people is Roman Catholicism. Sika people residing in the interior still retain their traditional ancestral worship and Agrarianism cult. Culture Sika people are part of the indigenous population of the Flores island. The material culture of the mountaineers retained more traditional elements than on the coast, especially in the western part, where the Catholic mission worked actively since the 17th century; where it is here that their culture acquired European features. Traditional activities Sika people engage in slash-and-burn agriculture with short forms of shifting cultivation. In the west of the coastal area, irrigation is used. Food crops farming include rice, corn, cassava and millet; and other commodities are such as peanuts and coconut palm. Sika people also raise horses, small cattle and poultry. Coastal fishing is also common. Weaving and braiding are well developed. Commodity-money relations are intertwined with numerous survivals of the traditional communal system, where it is manifested in the system of land ownership, regulation of marriages and in everyday life. Lifestyle Mountain villages are small and have a circular layout, are located on the steep slopes of the mountains; which served as protection against attacks. In the middle of the settlement there is an area with a temple and sacred megalithic shrines. Coastal settlements have a linear plan, located along a road or river. The dwelling frame and pillar structure, pile, in the mountains is designed for large families, while in the coastal areas, for a small family. Clothing of the those living in the interior consists of a skirt or loincloth. In coastal villages, they carry kain (cloth) and a jacket or shirt. The dietary of the Sika people are such as vegetable and mostly cereals from wheat and corn with spices, fruit and juice. Fish and meat are eaten on holidays.

Its production was cut short, and the few vehicles produced were out of service by the time of the Battle of France in the Second World War. Development Alarmed by the rapid build-up of the Red Army the French Army on 24 December 1931 conceived a preliminary plan for the mechanisation of the Cavalry. This foresaw the development of several types of automitrailleuses ‚Äî the official term for cavalry tanks because chars (\\"tanks\\") were by law part of the infantry arm ‚Äî among which an Automitrailleuse de Combat or AMC, a lightly armoured (weighing no more than nine tons) but swift (30 km/h cruise speed) and strongly armed (47 mm gun) combat tank, capable of fighting enemy armour. The plan was affirmed by the French Supreme Command on 23 January 1932 and approved by the ministry of defence on 9 December. Even before Plan 1931 was put on paper Louis Renault was informed of its probable contents and in the autumn of 1931 he ordered his design team to build an AMC. The team proposed to use welded steel plates, but Renault refused as this entailed hiring expensive professional welders. The team nevertheless took the initiative to build the Renault VO, a fully welded prototype of a Char Rapide, that could also serve as an alternative for the AMR 33 developed at the same time. When the vehicle was finished in 1932 Renault was charmed by the proposal but after long consideration decided against it and ordered a riveted version to be built. This quickly proved to be much too heavy and this caused a complete redesign of the project into a much smaller vehicle, the Renault YR, only to be presented to the French materiel commission, the Commission de Vincennes, on 12 October 1933, still fitted with the welded turret of the Renault VO. After testing by the Section Technique de la Cavalerie the prototype was improved by installing larger fuel tanks and a stronger clutch and gearbox. On 9 March 1934 an order was made for a pre-series of twelve hulls of the AMC 34; later a choice would be made from the range of standard turrets. The first was delivered on 17 October 1935. Description The AMC 34 is a small vehicle with a length of 3.98 m and a width of 2.07 m. The suspension of the prototype is identical to that of the AMR 33; the production vehicles use a type that was originally envisaged for the AMR 35: a central bogie with a vertical spring; two other wheels in front and behind with an oil-dampened horizontal spring. The engine, a 7.125 litre V-8 120 hp with a fuel tank of 220 litres rendering a top speed of 40 km/h and a range of 200 kilometres, is located on the right; the driver on the left with a hatch in front of him and an escape door behind him. The armour is 20 mm on the vertical plates; the weight ‚Äî of the hull only ‚Äî 9.7 metric tons. Operational history =Plan 1934= Before the first vehicle was even delivered, it was decided on 26 June 1934, as part of the Plan 1934 to improve both quantity and quality of French tank production, to change the specifications for an AMC: its armour had to be immune to anti-tank guns. As the AMC 34 was not strong enough to carry the extra weight it was redesigned into the AMC 35. No more orders of the original type were made. =France and Morocco= France, however, had such a dearth of modern tanks that it could not afford to forget the twelve pre-series vehicles. In January 1936 they were taken into use with the 4th Cuirasssiers, at first fitted with gun turrets removed from Renault FTs and then with the APX1 turret also used for the Char D2s, armed with an SA34 47 mm gun. By 1937 the growing production of more modern tanks allowed the AMC 34 hulls to be shipped from France to Morocco to be used by the 1e R√©giment Chasseurs d'Afrique, which received them on 15 December 1937. They were at the time the most modern armoured vehicles in the colonies, but were refitted with the two-man APX2 turret. It took many months before 25 mm guns could be fitted as well; until that time the tanks drove around with just the 7.5 mm machine guns. The tanks used the ER 28 short wave radio (all AMCs were supposed to have radio sets); also a better protected fuel tank at the back was installed together with a safer horizontal ventilation grille on the back engine deck. In November 1939 the AMC 34 was replaced by the \\"H 39\\"; three vehicles were taken by 5 RCA and used for driver training. These and the other nine vehicles do not appear on the armistice control lists, so they were either already scrapped in the summer of 1940 or hidden. =Order by Belgium= In 1935 the Belgian cavalry started a mechanisation programme. It was planned to equip all six cavalry regiments with an organic squadron of twelve tanks: eight T-15 and four guntanks. To fill the latter position on 13 September 1935, 25 AMC 34 hulls were ordered with Renault, at a unit price of 360,000 French francs, and 25 turrets with APX. The AMC 34 had been chosen over the competing Vickers Medium Tank Mark F after testing the prototype from 7 until 10 November 1934. It was stipulated that the production vehicles would be of an improved configuration and be delivered in a rate of three per month from October 1935 onwards.Georges E. Mazy, 2008, \\"Les Autos Blind√©s Lourds du Corps de Cavalerie Belge 1940\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s & Mat√©riel, N¬∞ 84, p.19 However, due to technical and financial problems, Renault was unable to deliver. Only after a delay of over three years the hulls were exported in the reduced number of ten; they were then almost identical to the AMC 35. The ordered APX2 turrets were refitted with Belgian 47 mm guns and 7.65 mm Hotchkiss machine guns; thirteen were used on coastal defence pillboxes. After the war many French armour historians assumed that the original order of 25, thought to be simply made of the AMC 35, was fully completed and adjusted the presumed production numbers of that tank accordingly, leading to an overestimate worsened by counting the Belgian vehicles twice.

The State of the Nation Address (abbreviated SONA; Filipino: Talumpat√¨ sa Kalagayan ng Bans√¢) is an annual address by the President of the Philippines to a joint session of the Congress of the Philippines. Mandated by the 1987 Constitution, the speech is delivered every fourth Monday of July at the Plenary Session Hall of the Batasang Pambansa Complex in Batasan Hills, Quezon City, Metro Manila. The SONA, which is often broadcast, serves as a means to inform the nation about its present economic, political, and social condition. It is also a vehicle for the President to summarise the accomplishments and plans of his/her programme of government both for a particular year and until the end of their term of office. Ceremonial of the President The Address is usually delivered at around 16:00 PST (UTC+8). Before the appointed time, legislators enter the Plenary Session Hall, with Congresswomen and consorts of Congressmen in recent years sporting traditionally-inspired bespoke couture that, in some cases, expresses their legislative agenda or ideological leanings. The President meanwhile arrives at the Batasang Pambansa Complex some minutes before the beginning of the joint session, and enters the main building through a back entrance. The President is then welcomed with military honors, and greeted by the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, and the welcoming committee, before proceeding to the Presidential Legislate Liaison Office. The President then enters the Plenary Session Hall as the Presidential Anthem is played. The Secretary General introduces the President, who approaches the rostrum and is seated. The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House then convene the joint session, and the House of Representatives Choir leads the now standing assembly in singing Lupang Hinirang. Representatives of various religious groups then lead the assembly in an ecumenical prayer. The Speaker then introduces the President in English or Filipino with words similar to the following: The Address, which can last anywhere from one to several hours, is broadcast on television, radio, and online streaming by state agencies such as Radio Television Malaca√±ang, as well as private media organizations. History =Malolos Congress= An early form of the Address was in place during the First Philippine Republic, which was established in 1899 in Malolos, Bulacan. The revolutionary government took ideas from European parliaments, where the magisterial role of the head of state in the legislature was to mark the legislature's official opening. The Malolos Constitution of 1899 provided for the President to preside over the opening of Congress, as well as convey his messages to the legislature through a secretary. When Emilio Aguinaldo addressed the Malolos Congress in Spanish on September 15, 1898, he simply congratulated the formation of the first representative body of the Philippines and Asia. This is not considered a State of the Nation Address because the Malolos Constitution did not explicitly provide for one. =American Period= The State of the Nation Address as an annual practise began during the Commonwealth Era. The Jones Act enacted in 1916 was the first instance where a report about the Philippine Islands was required to be submitted. However, the law only mandated a report by the Governor-General to an executive office assigned by the President of the United States. This was in the form of a written document that discussed the transactions and movements of the Insular Government. When the Commonwealth of the Philippines was created and the 1935 Constitution enacted, it provided for an annual report of the President of the Philippines to Congress: > \\"The President shall from time to time give to the Congress information on > the state of the Nation, and recommend to its consideration such measures as > he shall judge necessary and expedient.\\" The first formal State of the Nation Address was delivered by President Manuel L. Quezon on June 16, 1936 at the Legislative Building in Manila. The dates of the SONA were fixed on June 16 of every year at the start of opening sessions of Congress, by virtue of Commonwealth Act ‚Ññ 17. However, CA 49 changed the date of the opening of Congress to October 16. In 1937, October 16 fell on a Saturday, and the opening of Congress was moved to 18th, when Quezon gave the second State of the Nation Address. The opening date of Congress was again changed that year to the fourth Monday of every year. President Manuel L. Quezon delivered his final State of the Nation Address on January 31, 1941, prior to the onset of World War II. Second World War Jos√© P. Laurel, president of the Japanese-sponsored puppet Second Republic, was able to deliver his only message before the special session of the National Assembly, led by Speaker Benigno S. Aquino, Sr., on 18 October at the Legislative Building--four days after the Second Republic's establishment. This is, however, not considered a SONA as the 1943 Constitution did not‚Äîas President Laurel himself pointed out‚Äîprovide for such an address. With the 1945 defeat of the Japanese Empire and the re-establishment of the Commonwealth Government, the now-bicameral Congress of the Philippines convened on June 9, 1945, the first time since their election in 1941. During this special session, President Sergio Osme√±a addressed lawmakers at their provisional quarters (a repurposed schoolhouse) along Lepanto Street in Manila, and gave a comprehensive report on the work carried out by the Commonwealth Government during its three-year as a government-in-exile in Washington, D.C.. Furthermore, he described the conditions prevailing in the Philippines during the Japanese Occupation and an acknowledgment of the invaluable assistance rendered by recognized guerrillas to combined Filipino and American forces in the liberation of the Philippines. The last Address of the Commonwealth was delivered by President Manuel Roxas on June 3, 1946. President Roxas would later deliver the first SONA of the Third Philippine Republic in front of the First Congress on January 27, 1947. =Third Republic= Beginning in 1949, the SONA was delivered at the rebuilt Legislative Building. Only once did a President not appear personally before Congress: on January 23, 1950, President Elpidio Quirino, who was recuperating at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, delivered his SONA to a joint session of Congress via RCA. The Address was picked up by a local radio network at 10:00 Philippine Time (GMT+8), in time for the opening of the regular session of the 2nd Congress. =Martial Law and the Fourth Republic= The tradition of delivering the SONA on the fourth Monday of January ended in 1972, when from 1973 to 1977, President Ferdinand E. Marcos delivered the Address every September 21‚Äîthe official anniversary of his imposition of Martial Law upon the country. Since Congress was abolished with the promulgation of the 1973 Constitution, these addresses were delivered before a legislative assembly either in Malaca√±ang Palace or at Rizal Park, except in 1976 when the Address was given during the opening of the Batasang Bayan at the Philippine International Convention Center. President Marcos began giving the Address at the Batasang Pambansa Complex on June 12, 1978 during the opening session of the Interim Batasang Pambansa. From 1979 onwards, the SONA was delivered on the fourth Monday of July, following the provisions in the 1973 Constitution and the superseding 1987 Constitution. The only exceptions to this were in 1983, when the SONA was delivered on January 17 (the anniversary of the 1973 Constitution's ratification and the second anniversary of the lifting of Martial Law), and in 1986 when President Coraz√≥n C. Aquino did not deliver any SONA following the People Power Revolution. =Fifth Republic= With the re- establishment of Congress in 1987, President Coraz√≥n C. Aquino delivered her first SONA at the Plenary Hall of the Batasang Pambansa. All her successors in the office have since delivered their respective Addresses in the same venue. Variations Local chief executives also give their own addresses modeled after the State of the Nation Address. These speeches are not mandated by law, but are given usually as a matter of practice or tradition. *In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, this is called a \\"State of the Region\\" Address (SORA), given by the Chief Minister of Bangsamoro. *At the provincial level, the governor's speech is called a \\"State of the Province\\" Address (SOPA). *At the civic and municipal level, this is called either a \\"State of the City Address\\" (SOCA) or \\"State of the Municipality\\" Address (SOMA), given by the mayor. *At the barangay level, the barangay chairman speech is called a \\"State of the Barangay\\" Address (SOBA). *It is also the practice of the Philippine Independent Church, a Christian denomination formed in the wake of the Philippine Revolution in the spirit of a national church, to release an annual \\"State of the Church\\" Address coming from the Obispo M√°ximo (Supreme Bishop). Criticism Recent addresses have been the subject of criticism by various sectors for being too ostentatious and flashy, with politicians and media personalities treating the event as a red carpet fashion show. Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago blasted the organizers and called the event a \\"thoughtless extravagance\\" where \\"peacocks spread their tails and turn around and around, as coached by media in a feeding frenzy.\\"http://www.rappler.com/nation/34585-miriam-santiago-sona-uniform Presumptive House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez for the 17th Congress urged representatives to dress in simple business attire for future addresses, preferably the Barong Tagalog for men and \\"short\\" Filipiniana for women, in preparation for President Rodrigo Duterte's first address in 2016.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida Marlins, Seattle Mariners, Los Angeles Angels, Kansas City Royals, New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies. The Marlins drafted Vargas in the second round of the 2004 MLB draft. He made his major league debut in 2005. In 2017, he was an All Star and tied for the American League lead in wins. Amateur career Vargas pitching for the Long Beach State 49ers in 2004 Vargas was born in Apple Valley, California. He attended Victor Valley High School in Victorville, California, where he played for the school's baseball team under his father, who was head coach. His father retired in 1998, and Vargas transferred to Apple Valley High School in Apple Valley. Vargas graduated in 2001. The Minnesota Twins drafted him with the 1,273rd pick in the 2001 Major League Baseball draft. He declined to sign with Minnesota, and instead enrolled at Louisiana State University (LSU) to play college baseball for the LSU Tigers. As a freshman at LSU, Vargas had a 1‚Äì1 win-loss record with a 3.43 earned run average in 13 games. He also saw occasional playing time as a first baseman and designated hitter. In his first college at bat, he launched a pinch hit grand slam to lift the Tigers to a victory over Mercer. Vargas decided to transfer out of LSU after the 2002 season to Cypress College for the season, picking a junior college so he would still be eligible for the draft. He was 11‚Äì3 with a 3.10 ERA and 101 strikeouts in 107.1 innings as he batted .374. He was the Southern California junior college player of the year for his work on the mound and at the plate. However, as the season wore on, his arm slot dropped, and his velocity fell into the mid-80s. That, combined with Vargas' signing bonus demands, depressed his draft stock, so he went undrafted. Vargas transferred to California State University, Long Beach to play for the Long Beach State 49ers for his junior year. At Long Beach, he learned to keep his top half aligned with his lower half over the rubber and not drift toward the plate as he twisted through his delivery. The tweak allowed Vargas to repeat his mechanics and keep his arm higher, which in turn increased the velocity on his fastball and improved the break on his curveball. The new work ethic paid off, and in Vargas went 7‚Äì4 with a 4.14 ERA in 18 games on the mound, while hitting .354 with 14 doubles and five home runs as the team's designated hitter. Professional career =Florida Marlins= The Florida Marlins drafted Vargas out of Long Beach State with their second-round pick in the 2004 MLB draft, and he was signed by scout Robby Cosaro; he was a collegiate teammate of Jered Weaver, who was the Anaheim Angels' first-round pick in 2004. Vargas was the 68th player taken overall in the draft. He signed with the Marlins in time to make eight starts in 2004 with their Low A affiliate, the Jamestown Jammers, with whom he went 3‚Äì1 with an ERA of 1.96 in eight starts, and was named the #3 prospect in the New York=Penn League by Baseball America. He was the Marlins Organizational Pitcher of the Month for August. He finished 2004 with three starts at the end of the 2004 campaign with one of the Marlins' Single-A affiliates, the Greensboro Grasshoppers of the South Atlantic League. He had a record of 2‚Äì1, an ERA of 2.37, and struck out 17 batters in 19 innings pitched. Vargas was then promising enough that Baseball America listed him 8th among the Marlins' top 10 prospects for ; those above him were Jeremy Hermida, Scott Olsen, Yorman Bazardo, Jason Stokes, Josh Willingham, Eric Reed, and Taylor Tankersley. Baseball America predicted that Vargas would start the season in Greensboro and finish it in High A with the Jupiter Hammerheads; Vargas would very easily surpass that expectation during the 2005 season. Vargas did start the 2005 season with Greensboro, as was expected, but he advanced quickly through the Marlins' minor-league system. He made five starts with Greensboro, going 4‚Äì1 with an earned run average of just 0.80 in five starts and was named South Atlantic League Pitcher of the Week on April 24, and the Marlins Organizational Pitcher of the Month for April, and Minor League Player of the Week honors for the week of April 18‚Äì24. He was then promoted to Jupiter, where he went 2‚Äì3 with a 3.42 ERA in nine starts; while there, he struck out 60 batters in 55 innings. With his third club of the year, the Double-A Carolina Mudcats, he made three starts, going 1‚Äì0 with a 2.84 ERA and 25 strikeouts in 19 innings pitched. He led all Florida minor league pitchers in 2005 with a 2.50 ERA. The Marlins noticed Vargas's success in the minor leagues and, when faced with injuries to their own pitching staff, decided to make him the fourth Mudcats pitcher to play in the major leagues in 2005 (the others were Logan Kensing, Olsen, and Bazardo). He made his major-league debut on July 14, 2005, the same day on which the Marlins designated veteran starter Al Leiter for assignment. His first start in the majors would come on July 18 against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Unlike Kensing, Olsen, and Bazardo, Vargas enjoyed nearly immediate success upon his arrival in the major leagues, and after Ismael Vald√©z returned from a leg injury, the Marlins moved Brian Moehler to the bullpen and left Vargas in their rotation. On August 21, Vargas started against the Dodgers and pitched his first complete game in the majors, giving up one run on six hits and striking out seven. He finished the 2005 season with a record of 5‚Äì5 and a 4.03 ERA in 17 games, 13 of which were starts. Vargas received one third-place vote from the Baseball Writers' Association of America in the 2005 MLB Rookie of the Year voting. Vargas started the season in the Marlins' starting rotation, but he struggled there; in five starts, he went 1‚Äì1 with a 5.40 ERA, 20 walks, and 14 strikeouts in 23 innings. For the month of May, the Marlins moved him to the bullpen, where he gave up one run in 5 innings over his first three appearances. In his fourth appearance out of the bullpen, he allowed eight runs (seven earned) over 3 innings; the Marlins optioned him to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes on May 14. Vargas started improving with Albuquerque, going 2‚Äì2 with a 4.54 ERA in seven starts and earning another promotion to the major leagues on July 6. However, over his next three games with the Marlins, all in relief, Vargas allowed 13 runs (12 earned), four home runs, and five walks in 10 innings; he struck out five batters. The Marlins sent him back to Albuquerque on July 29, where he stayed for the rest of Albuquerque's season. Vargas continued to struggle in his second stint with Albuquerque, allowing 38 earned runs on 56 hits in 31 innings. The Marlins did not call him up again in 2006 after the major-league rosters expanded in September. Overall, Vargas went 1‚Äì2 with a 7.33 ERA in 12 games (five of which were starts) for the Marlins, and 3‚Äì6 with a 7.43 ERA in 13 starts for the Isotopes in 2006. =New York Mets= On November 20, 2006, the Marlins traded Vargas to the New York Mets along with fellow starting pitcher Adam Bostick in exchange for relief pitchers Matt Lindstrom and Henry Owens. Vargas began the season with the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs, compiling a 2‚Äì3 record with a 5.30 ERA, which Mets manager Willie Randolph described as \\"so-so\\". He was called up to the Mets on May 13 after an injured Mois√©s Alou was sent to the disabled list, and took over the rotation spot previously held by Mike Pelfrey, who was optioned to New Orleans after posting an 0‚Äì5 record in 6 outings. His first outing as a Met was on May 17, a no decision in a 6‚Äì5 victory over the Chicago Cubs. His next outing as a Met was on July 3 against the Colorado Rockies. Vargas pitched 3.1 innings, giving up nine earned runs. He pitched only 10.1 innings for the Mets in 2007. Vargas had a bone spur removed from his left elbow in October, and had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his left hip on March 17, 2008, following which he missed the entire 2008 season. =Seattle Mariners= Seattle Mariners in 2011 On December 10, , Vargas was one of seven players sent to the Seattle Mariners in a three-team trade between the Mets, Mariners, and the Cleveland Indians. Vargas was optioned down to the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers on July 7, , to make roster room for Chris Shelton. On September 1 Vargas was called up to the Majors. He had been 4‚Äì3 with a 3.14 ERA in nine starts with Tacoma. In 2009 with Seattle he was 3‚Äì6 with a 4.91 ERA in 23 games, 14 of which were starts. Vargas started the 2010 Mariner season in the squad's starting rotation, and through June proved to be one of the most surprising success stories on the troubled Seattle team's roster. Through 14 starts he had posted a 6‚Äì2 record over 91.1 innings, with a 2.66 ERA, 60 strikeouts, and 23 walks. By the end of the season Vargas had thrown 192 innings over 31 starts, and posted a 9‚Äì12 record with a 3.78 ERA and 116 strikeouts. He kept left-handed batters to a .200 average, which was 9th-lowest in the American League. In 2011 he was 10‚Äì13 with a 4.25 ERA in 32 starts, and his three shutouts were 3rd in the league while his four complete games were 4th in the league, and his 13 losses were 7th in the league. In January 2012 the Mariners and Vargas agreed on a 1-year deal worth $4.85 million for the 2012 season. In July, Vargas went 5‚Äì0 in six starts, had an AL-best 1.64 ERA, and was named the AL Pitcher of the Month. For the season, he was 14‚Äì11 with a 3.85 ERA, his 33 starts were fourth in the league, and his 217.3 innings pitched were sixth in the American League, while his 35 home runs given up were second in the league. =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim= Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2013 On December 19, 2012, Vargas was traded to the Los Angeles Angels for first baseman Kendrys Morales. In May 2013 he was again AL Pitcher of the Month. In 2013, he was 9‚Äì8 with a 4.02 ERA in 24 starts, and his two shutouts and his three complete games were each 3rd in the league. =Kansas City Royals= On November 21, 2013, Vargas signed a four-year, $32 million contract with the Kansas City Royals. He opened the 2014 season as the number three starter for the Royals and posted a career-best 3.71 ERA over 187 innings, as he was 11‚Äì10 in 30 starts.https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/v/vargaja01.shtml[] His 1.97 walks per 9.0 innings ratio tied for 10th in the American League, and was third-best among AL left- handers. On July 21, 2015, during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Vargas was forced to leave the game after throwing only 26 pitches, with an apparent injury to his throwing arm. The next day, Vargas was diagnosed with a torn UCL in his left elbow, forcing him to undergo Tommy John surgery and miss the remainder of the 2015 season and much of the 2016 season. For 2015, he was 5‚Äì2 with a 3.98 ERA in nine starts. Although his season ended prematurely before the Royals' World Series run in 2015, he did receive a World Series ring. On September 17, 2016, he made his first start following his recovery from surgery, against the Chicago White Sox. In 2016 he pitched only 12 innings, all of which were scoreless. The 2017 season was Vargas's fourth year with the Kansas City Royals, and his first full season since undergoing Tommy John surgery. Vargas started strong, going 12‚Äì3 in the first half, and was named to the American League All Star team for the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It was the first-ever All Star selection of his career. In the second half Vargas struggled, posting a 2‚Äì8 record, including a four-game losing streak. He rebounded, however, winning four straight decisions in the month of September, and in the process establishing a career-high for wins. Vargas finished the season with an 18‚Äì11 record and an ERA of 4.16 in 179.2 innings, with his 18 wins tied for the American League lead, and his 32 starts 9th in the league. He led major league pitchers in percent of balls pulled against him (48.8%). He also led all major league pitchers in changeup percentage (32.7%). On defense his 23 assists as a pitcher were 5th in the league, as his 1.60 range factor/9IP was 4th in the league and he fielded 1.000. =Return to the Mets= On February 18, 2018, Vargas signed with the Mets for two years and $16 million, plus an $8 million option for a third year. On March 16, Vargas suffered a non-displaced fracture of the hamate bone in his right hand. He missed the first month of the season due to the broken right hand. On June 25, he was once again placed on the disabled list, with a calf injury. On August 29, he struck out his 1,000th batter becoming one of 16 active left-handers to reach that milestone. In 2018, he posted a 7‚Äì9 record with a 5.77 ERA in 20 starts. On June 23, 2019, Vargas threatened a Newsday reporter with bodily harm (i.e., being punched out) in the Mets locker room after a game against the Cubs. The following day Vargas was fined $10,000 by the Mets for his actions. At the time that he was traded in 2019, he was 6‚Äì5 with a 4.01 ERA for the Mets, in 19 games, 18 of which were starts. =Philadelphia Phillies= On July 29, 2019, the Mets traded Vargas and $2.9 million to the Philadelphia Phillies for Double-A minor league catcher Austin Bossart.

Pingree family Seven Islands manages approximately 1 million acres (4,000 km¬≤) of forest in the North Maine Woods, in northern and western Maine, for dozens of members of the Pingree family, descendants of wealthy Salem, Massachusetts shipping magnate David Pingree (nicknamed the \\"Merchant Prince of Salem\\"). He began to acquire the Maine lands more than 150 years ago. In 1997, the family's Seven Islands Land Company is believed to be the fourth largest private landowner in the United States, according to an analysis by Worth magazine. Worth magazine: \\"100 landlords\\". Seven Islands is integrally tied to another family entity, Pingree Associates. As of 2017, the Pingree family is 10th largest private landowner in the United States. =History= The Pingree family holdings date back to 1820, when Maine became a state. In that year, Pingree, correctly believing that his city would cease to be a major port, started purchasing vast tracts of softwoods and hardwoods as an investment hedge. Over the next 150 years, the Pingree holdings would reach 1 million acres (4,000 km¬≤) and include over 2,000 miles (3200 km) of shore frontage along major rivers and streams, more than 100 lakes, 24,800 acres (100 km¬≤) of deer yards and 72,000 acres (290 km¬≤) of wetland habitat. Development and conservation Development on the Pingree's Seven Islands Land Company property, much of which surrounds Baxter State Park and the Allagash River, is heavily restricted. In 2001, Pingree Associates announced they had negotiated an arrangement with the New England Forestry Foundation to sell undevelopable easements on three-quarters of their nearly 1 million acres (4,000 km¬≤). The remaining 250,000 acres (1,000 km¬≤) were made available for limited development. The agreement created the largest conservation easement in American history, effectively putting an area larger than the state of Rhode Island off-limits to development.

It was opened to passenger traffic on 21 February 1842, between its Glasgow Queen Street railway station (sometimes referred to at first as Dundas Street) and Haymarket railway station in Edinburgh. Construction cost ¬£1,200,000 for 46 miles (74 km). The intermediate stations were at Corstorphine (later Saughton), Gogar, Ratho, Winchburgh, Linlithgow, Polmont, Falkirk, Castlecary, Croy, Kirkintilloch (later Lenzie) and Bishopbriggs. There was a ticket platform at Cowlairs. The line was extended eastwards from Haymarket to North Bridge in 1846, and a joint station for connection with the North British Railway was opened on what is now Edinburgh Waverley railway station in 1847. The quantity of passenger business on the line considerably exceeded estimates, reaching almost double the daily volume, and by 1850 company needed 58 locomotives and 216 coaches to handle the traffic. Goods traffic started in March 1842 and slowly increased, overtaking passenger traffic in revenue terms by 1855. The line still runs today as the main line between Edinburgh and Glasgow. It was electrified and improved under the auspices of the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme. 8-car electric class 385 trains started operating from Monday 29 July 2019 between Glasgow and Edinburgh via Falkirk High. The fastest trains are scheduled to take 42 minutes. History =Early schemes= The earliest railways in Scotland were waggonways, intended for horse drawn operation, in most cases from a colliery or other mineral source, to a waterway for onward transport. Notable early lines were the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway of 1812 and the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway of 1826, the first of the \\"coal railways\\" of the Monklands area. The Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway (G&GR;) was authorised in the same year, and it opened in 1831. There were unfulfilled ideas of connecting Glasgow and Edinburgh as early as 1824 and when the G&GR; got its authorising Act, there were thoughts of extending from Broomielaw in Glasgow over the G&GR; to Edinburgh and Leith; the connection to sea-going shipping was paramount. In 1830 the railway engineers Thomas Grainger and John Miller were commissioned to survey for such a line. There was to be a tunnel under the centre of Glasgow but there was furious opposition to this; it was so strong that the proposal failed. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway had opened in 1830, and was more successful than its promoters expected, and showed that an intercity railway could be commercially successful. The pressure to connect the two great cities of central Scotland continued, and in the second half of the 1830s money became freely available, and investors, chiefly in England (many of them shareholders in the Liverpool and Manchester line), promoted a viable railway. =E&GR; authorised= The first main line of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, 1842 The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway was authorised by Act of Parliament on 4 July 1838. The Bill had been in Committee for 37 days. The first contract was let in late 1838. Bad weather delayed the progress of the work but on New Years Day 1842 the public were invited to walk through the tunnel at Glasgow Queen Street. Policeman were stationed to prevent the entrance of disorderly persons. The tunnel was whitewashed and gas lit, and the proceeds went to the Paisley Relief Fund and workmen injured on the railway. The Glasgow terminal was designed by James Carswell. The line was engineered as a main line, and substantial earthworks, viaducts and tunnels were incorporated into the route, forming an almost perfectly level route, apart from the climb out of the Glasgow terminal. The original intention was to descend gently into Glasgow, crossing over the Forth and Clyde Canal, but opposition from the canal company obliged the E&GR; to be brought under it instead, resulting in a steep descent at 1 in 41 from Cowlairs mostly in tunnel. Cowlairs tunnel is 1000 yards (914 m) in length. There were other major structures on the line: the Garngaber Viaduct carried the line over Bothlin Burn and the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway; Castlecary Viaduct consists of 8 arches and is 200 yards long. The Falkirk (or Callendar) tunnel is 845 yards long. Approaching Linlithgow the Avon Viaduct consists of 23 arches; Winchburgh tunnel is 372 yards in length; and the Almond Viaduct has 36 arches; it cost ¬£130,000 to build. The permanent way consisted of malleable iron rails on stone blocks; the form of construction was already obsolete; \\"half logs\\" were used in some places. The construction of the E&GR; line to the Haymarket terminal in Edinburgh cost ¬£1,200,000 for 46 miles (74 km). The 30 miles (48 km) of the Liverpool and Manchester had cost ¬£1,407,000. =Opening= A ceremonial opening of the line took place on 19 February 1842 and the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened for passenger traffic on 21 February 1842, between its Glasgow station (sometimes referred to at first as Dundas Street, and later named Queen Street) and Edinburgh, where the station was at Haymarket, at the western edge of the New Town. It was Scotland's first trunk line. Goods traffic started in March 1842. There were four passenger trains each way daily; and there were ten intermediate stations and the journey took 150 minutes. Two passenger trains ran each way on Sundays, \\"timed at hours which would not interfere with the ordinary period of divine service\\". This provoked great controversy as the observance of the Sabbath was held as sacred by much of Scottish public opinion at the time. Edinburgh time was observed, 4.5 minutes later than Glasgow time. The intermediate stations were at Corstorphine (later Saughton), Gogar, Ratho, Winchburgh, Linlithgow, Polmont, Falkirk, Castlecary, Croy, Kirkintilloch (later Lenzie) and Bishopbriggs. There was a ticket platform at Cowlairs.Smith says Gogar station opened \\"shortly after the line itself\\". The opening created phenomenal passenger demand, three times what was expected, and by 1850 company needed 58 locomotives and 216 coaches to handle the traffic. The quantity of passenger business on the line considerably exceeded the estimates, reaching almost double the daily volume; third class travel was especially buoyant, although in the first years third class passengers did not have seating accommodation, and even second class carriages did not have glazed windows. Goods traffic started in March 1842 and slowly increased, overtaking passenger traffic in revenue terms by 1855. In the years 1845 ‚Äì 1846, Alexander Bain installed an electric telegraph system along the line; the cost to him was ¬£50 per mile. =Cowlairs incline= The incline section was worked by stationary engine and cable haulage: an 80 hp (60 kW) high pressure steam engine was constructed at Cowlairs, and a continuous hemp rope was used to pull trains up the gradients. Special brake vehicles were attached to downwards trains to control the descent. There was soon difficulty with the hemp rope slipping in damp weather, and two banking enginesEngines specifically provided to push heavy trains up the steep gradient. named Samson and Hercules, were introduced in 1844, but they were found to be damaging to the track, and the powerful exhaust caused vibrations in the roof, leading to leakage of the canal water. The banking engines were sent to the Monklands area in 1848, and wire rope haulage with the stationary engine was used instead. The endless rope for the incline was driven by two beam engines at Cowlairs, of the high pressure type, made by Kerr, Neilson and Company of Glasgow. They had 28 inch cylinders, and 72 inch stroke. The crankshaft had a spur wheel of 12 feet diameter, which drove the cable drum through gearing. The main cable drum was 18 feet in diameter, mounted in a pit under the track. The beam engines were supplied with steam at 50 psi by 8 boilers, each 30 feet long and 5 feet diameter. The boilers were replaced in 1862 ‚Äì 1863 by seven Cornish boilers. The cable haulage continued in operation until 31 January 1908, when banking engines took over. The stationary engines at Cowlairs were scrapped the following year. An accident took place in 1869 and the Inspecting Officer's report gives a flavour of the operations on the incline: > Trains are worked up the incline between Queen's Street station and Cowlairs > by attaching them to an endless wire rope, which is worked by a stationary > engine at the top of the incline, and trains are piloted down the incline > from Cowlairs to Queen's Street station, by attaching heavy breaks with a > breaksman in each break in front of the trains. Sometimes the engines remain > attached to the tail of the trains in descending the incline, and sometimes > the trains proceed without an engine. This depends on whether the engine is > required at Queen's Street or not, but in every case the breaksmen, who > travel on the incline breaks in front of the train, are placed in charge of > the train. > On the 25th of last November, 13 empty waggons were required at Queen's > street station, and a message to that effect was telegraphed to Cowlairs, > where there is a large depot. A train of 13 empty waggons, with two incline > breaks and two breaksmen in front, and an engine and tender behind the > waggons, was formed at the top of the incline at the west end of Cowlairs > station on the day in question, and it was despatched by signal at 5.6 pm to > Queen's Street. \\"Line Clear\\" had been received from Queen's Street telegraph > hut, and the telegraph clerk at Cowlairs, after telegraphing to Queen's > Street that the train of empties had left, telegraphed \\"engine behind\\". The rear part of the train became derailed in the tunnel, and the train became divided; the front part continued and the telegraph clerk failed to satisfy himself that the whole train had arrived; later, > At this time a passenger train from Helensburgh had been twice telegraphed > from Cowlairs to Queen's Street, but the clerk at Queen's Street would not > accept the train, as the empties had not arrived. As soon as the 11 empties > arrived, he telegraphed \\"line clear\\" and a train, which consisted of three > incline breaks and three breaksmen, a carriage truck, a horse box, a 3rd > [class carriage], a 1st, a 3rd, a 1st, a guard's van, a 1st, a 3rd, a 1st, a > 3rd, and a guard's van, coupled in the order given, left Cowlairs for > Queen's Street station at 5.15 pm.

Hamilton Ellis described the operation after the banking engines were first discontinued: > Rails continued to break under the heavy banking engines and the stationary > engine was brought out of retirement, and Newall‚Äôs untwisted cable > substituted for the earlier hemp rope. The cable was 2.78 miles long and > weighed 24 tons. Leaving Glasgow the train moved slowly to the tunnel mouth > and there a chain secured to a hemp messenger rope, lashed in turn to the > cable, was linked to the front drawhook [which was inverted]. The locomotive > then set back slightly to make the messenger rope taut. This of course > brought the main cable up against the underside of the engine, where a > pulley wheel was mounted to engage with it and prevent it from fouling. With > the locomotive thus secured to the cable, the driver, advised by the foreman > cable attendant, gave a whistle signal, and the Queen Street signalman then > telegraphed the Cowlairs box. If and when the line was clear, the Cowlairs > signalman sounded three blasts on a horn, piped down through the tunnel and > the winding engine was started. > As the cable began to pull, simultaneously the driver started his locomotive > and the train, thus double powered, swept solemnly up to Cowlairs. South of > the Cowlairs engine house, the gradient eased off and the locomotive, > working hard, would gain on the slowing cable, so that the messenger > automatically dropped off the inverted drawhook and left the train entirely > to the power of its own engine.

Tickets were > meanwhile collected. The engine would then propel the train gently over the > top of the incline, whence it trundled down into the city with all the > brakes squealing. =Monkland Railways= The coal railways of the Monkland district had been very successful early entrants in the field of conveying minerals to market, but as technological pioneers they were now at a disadvantage, with their primitive track and a track gauge that was now non-standard, preventing through running. They worked together in a loose collaboration. In 1844 the E&GR; agreed a takeover with them, and from the first day of 1846 took on the operation of their lines, while Parliamentary permission for formal takeover was sought. On 3 July 1846 this was refused by Parliament, and the E&GR; withdrew from the informal arrangement at the end of 1846. At this time the Caledonian Railway was planning its route linking Glasgow, and the Caledonian concluded an agreement to take over the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway and the Wishaw and Coltness Railway. The other coal railways aligned themselves away from the Caledonian Railway's influence, and in 1848 they merged to form the Monkland Railways. =Extending to Waverley= The Haymarket terminal was at the western extremity of Edinburgh and inconveniently located, and an Act was obtained on 4 July 1844 to extend the line to a more central location. The North British Railway was building its main line from North Bridge station to Berwick-upon-Tweed,At the time the place was known as simply \\"Berwick\\". there to connect with the Newcastle and Berwick Railway (later to form the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway). The E&GR; extended their line eastwards from Haymarket to their own station at North Bridge immediately adjacent to the NBR station. The line opened for passenger traffic on 1 August 1846. The NBR had started operations on 22 June 1846. By then the North British Railway had commenced their passenger service, on 17 June.Ross (page 26) gives a description of an earlier event, apparently a demonstration run, partly quoting the Caledonian Mercury newspaper for 21 May 1846: \\"The Edinburgh and Glasgow's track between Haymarket and the North Bridge was finished in May 1846, but the joint station, also being built by the E&G;, was not. A large crowd assembled to cheer on 20 May as a train of first and second class NBR carriages was drawn 'from the tunnel at the West Church Manse, and rolled slowly and majestically along the valley of the North Loch', passing beneath the Mound, the recently-completed stone-arched Waverley Bridge (named for the adjacent almost-finished monument to Sir Walter Scott), and the North Bridge to be displayed at the North British station 'in the old Physic Gardens'. For a time the two stations were separate, and with separate goods stations in addition. The primitive passenger accommodation at first was only temporary: from 3 August 1846 E&GR; passengers were accommodated at a single platform partly under the northernmost of the Waverley Bridge's three wide arches.\\" On 17 May 1847 the permanent joint passenger station came into use. The North British Railway referred to it simply as \\"Edinburgh\\" station, or \\"North Bridge\\", although it was also known as the General station. On the same day the Edinburgh Leith and Granton Railway (formerly the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway) opened its line from Scotland Street to Canal Street station, adjacent to the new Edinburgh station and at right angles to the other routes. There was a siding connection to the E&GR; line. The E&GR; and NBR joint station was formally inaugurated on 22 February 1848. The accommodation at the station was clearly cramped, largely due to the built up surroundings limiting available land. Extension was under way in subsequent years but in 1852 a financial crisis within the North British Railway called a halt to the work and the original single platform under North Bridge was brought back into use. =Parallel routes= Stage coach operation on the route of the E&GR; fought a brave but futile rearguard action, but the Union Canal and the Forth and Clyde Canal continued to trade in goods and especially mineral traffic, although they lost nearly all of their passenger business. In 1845 there was a frenzy of railway promotion in Scotland, and the Caledonian Railway, among many others, was authorised by Act of Parliament; its capitalisation was ¬£1,500,000, to build a line from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle, linking there with English railways. Well before its Act, the Caledonian had set about capturing as many other railways, whether completed or still only proposals, as it could. It did so by concluding leases of those lines; the advantage of that was that the lease charge payments only became due later, and were annual percentages: no large front-end payment was necessary. The Caledonian would soon have its own line, albeit somewhat longer than the E&GR;, between Glasgow and Edinburgh, and its predatory behaviour led to alarm in the E&GR; board room that further Caledonian acquisitions and leases would result in serious harm to the E&GR.; Accordingly, the board proposed an amalgamation with the Monkland Railways, the Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness RailwayPaterson, page 69 lists these but says Wishaw and Coltness Railway instead of Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway. This must be a mistake; the Wishaw and Coltness was already leased by the Caledonian Railway, from 1 January 1847, whereas the Wilsontown line was proposed for amalgamation with the E&GR; in 1847. and the Scottish Central Railway, and the Forth and Clyde Canal, the Union Canal and the Monkland Canal. (The canals still carried substantial mineral traffic.) That group of companies worked as a voluntary combination for a few months under Bryan Padgett Gregson, an experienced manager of canals and railways from Lancashire. In late 1846 the Lancashire shareholders, insensitive to the fear of Caledonian hegemony and reluctant to spend money acquiring canals, which they considered to be beaten competitors, overturned the arrangement, and Gregson was dismissed. (In 1849 the E&GR; purchased the Union Canal for ¬£209,000, still against the opposition of the Lancashire shareholders.) On 1 April 1848 the Caledonian Railway opened its line between Edinburgh and Glasgow. It was difficult in operational terms, but in July the Caledonian accelerated its passenger trains and added new fast services, and cheap fares. The E&GR; responded with fare reductions, and a desperate price war soon developed. It could not continue and in September fares were increased by mutual agreement.This would be illegal nowadays, constituting price fixing. =Shieldhill branch= The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened its Shieldhill branch on 28 August 1847. This ran from the Slamannan Railway at Causewayend, heading westward to Blackbraes. There was already a considerable network of mineral tramways in the area, leading to the Union Canal, serving pits and tile works. =The Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway= The Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway (WM&CR;) was another of the \\"coal railways\\" serving mineral sites in Lanarkshire. It opened in 1845, and ran from a junction with the Wishaw and Coltness Railway at Morningside, to Longridge. The Board of Trade Inspecting Officer commented about the Longridge terminus: \\"The line terminates in a large field, about a mile from a small village called Whitburn\\". Although the line connected a number of pits, it was dependent on a long haul to Coatbridge, handing over to the W&C; railway at Morningside, and the line was not commercially successful. Raising money to continue eastwards to a more lucrative destination proved beyond the resources of the company. In 1847 the company decided that it could not continue independently, and the negotiated the sale of their line to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. A legal prohibition on amalgamation of companies which had not expended half of their authorised capital delayed the process until 1849, when an Act was obtained, authorising the sale to the E&GR;, which took full effect in 1850. In the hiatus period, and with the authorisation of the Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway, the WM&CR; enlisted E&GR; financial help and set about extending from Longridge to Bathgate. The E&GR; wished to exclude the Caledonian Railway from the area. The line opened to goods and mineral traffic early in 1850, and passenger traffic started in May 1850, after the takeover by the E&GR.; =Stirling and Dunfermline Railway= The Stirling and Dunfermline Railway was authorised on 16 July 1846. As well as linking the named places, there were to be branches to Alloa and Tillicoultry. The line opened between Dunfermline and Alloa on 28 August 1850, and Alloa Harbour and Tillicoultry were connected on 3 June 1851. The section from Alloa to Stirling was completed on 1 July 1852. At Dunfermline, the line made an end-on connection with the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway, giving onward connection to Fife. The company was vested in the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway by Act of 28 June 1858. =The Stirlingshire Midland Junction Railway= When the Caledonian Railway opened its line throughout in 1848, it had a connection to Greenhill, joining the E&GR; and the Scottish Central Railway there. The SCR gave access to Stirling and Perth and was an important connecting route. Moreover, the Caledonian and the SCR concluded a working arrangement which they expected to lead to formal merger. The E&GR; needed to ensure that it got access to the Stirling and Perth line from the Edinburgh direction, and to do so it sponsored the Stirlingshire Midland Junction Railway. The nominally independent company got its authorising Act of Parliament on 16 July 1846, to build a line from Polmont (on the E&GR;) through Grahamston (part of Falkirk), crossing the Forth and Clyde Canal and turning north to join the SCR near Larbert. Its capital was ¬£450,000, and branches were authorised to Carron Ironworks and to Falkirk Ironworks. The company's authorising act empowered sale to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, and this was done on 1 October 1850, before the line opened. =The Campsie branch= On 5 July 1848 the E&GR; opened the Campsie branch. This left the E&GR; main line east of Lenzie, and dropped down into the Kelvin Valley, running through Kirkintilloch, where it had a station separate from the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway station. The line continued from there through Milton of Campsie to Lennoxtown. =The Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway= Bathgate was an important manufacturing town and on 12 November 1849 the Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway was opened, from a junction with the E&GR; at Ratho. The line was worked by the E&GR.; =The Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway= The Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway was opened on 28 May 1858 from a junction at Cowlairs. The line was worked by the E&GR;, and goods traffic was handled at the E&GR; Sighthill yard; Queens Street was used for passengers. There was a last minute disagreement between the two companies, and at first the trains from Helensburgh ran to Buchanan Street via Sighthill, reversing on to the Caledonian Railway line. The disagreement was resolved and the intended use of E&GR; facilities took effect from 30 June 1858. =The Alva Railway= The Alva Railway was vested on 22 July 1861 and was opened from Alva to Cambus, on the Stirling and Dunfermline line, on 11 June 1863. It was vested in the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway on 31 July 1864. =Grangemouth= The Forth and Clyde Canal entered the Firth of Forth at Grangemouth, and a considerable harbour had been built up there. Grangemouth was only three miles from the E&G;'s Polmont to Grahamston line, and a branch railway was an obvious move. The Forth and Clyde Canal company built the line, from Grahamston. It opened in 1860 for goods traffic, and in 1861 for passengers. It was a single line and it was worked by the E&GR.; In 1867 the Caledonian Railway acquired the canal, and in doing so acquired the railway branch too. By now the North British Railway had absorbed the E&GR;, and the Grangemouth line was deep inside the territory the NBR considered its own. The NBR was given running powers over the line, giving access to the harbour. The Caledonian went to considerable lengths to improve the harbour (and the canal generally). The volume of rail traffic increased over time as Grangemouth became the dominant port, and a second route into Grangemouth, diverging from the Grahamston line west of Falkirk, was opened in 1908, both the NBR and the Caledonian having constructed their section, joining at the swing bridge over the canal. =Alliances, and a merger= The E&GR; system in 1865On 28 January 1862 the E&GR; and the Caledonian Railway signed the Thirty Years Agreement, in which traffic and receipts on a number of routes were shared by a pre-arranged formula.The date is from Thomas, volume 1 page 116, but he adds that the agreement was \\"due to come into force on 1 March 1866\\", four years later. Thomas may have intended to write \\"1862\\". This resulted in North British Railway transfer traffic to Glasgow being charged very high rates, and Hodgson, Chairman of the NBR, determined to get control of the E&GR.; In 1864 the Great Northern Railway and the North Eastern Railway suggested to Hodgson, that the three companies should jointly lease the E&GR;, forming an East Coast route into Glasgow, but it proved impossible to negotiate a deal. Hodgson prepared a scheme for a Glasgow and North British Railway, which would build an entirely new route to Glasgow. Alarmed, the E&GR; immediately reduced its rates to Glasgow, which broke its agreement with the Caledonian. On 23 June 1864 the E&GR; announced a change of policy and an end to the Thirty Years Agreement, and \\"an agreement of a permanent nature with the North British Company\\". The E&GR; had long been harbouring a plan to absorb the Monkland Railways, which had an extensive network in central Scotland mainly devoted to mineral sites. The proposal came to fruition on 31 July 1865, when the Monkland Railways were absorbed by the E&GR.; =Absorbed by the North British Railway= The following day, on 1 August 1865, the North British Railway absorbed the E&GR;, and with it the Monkland Railways. The Locomotive Superintendent of the NBR made a tour of inspection of E&GR; and Monkland Railways depots and found the rolling stock in an extremely poor state, badly under-reported in official returns. The E&GR; Cowlairs workshops were far superior to the NBR St Margarets, and they became the principal depot for the combined company. =Developments under the North British= Now part of the North British Railway network, the E&GR; line formed the trunk of the westward routes from Edinburgh. In 1872 a siding connection was provided near Lenzie for the construction of a mental hospital, at the time known as Woodilee Lunatic Asylum. The hospital itself opened in 1875. The siding was removed in 1963 after a period of disuse. The Glasgow Queen Street station was very cramped, and included a goods station. More branch services were terminating at the station, and in 1877 the North British Railway opened up the mouth of the tunnel and widened the station throat, and provided six platforms. (It had been built with a single arrival platform and a single departure platform, with three carriage stabling sidings between, and a goods station on the east side next to North Hanover Street.) The ascent of the Cowlairs incline continued to be a difficulty, and electric traction was proposed, but not proceeded with. From August 1909 steam traction with banking assistance handled everything; the cable haulage was discontinued. Traffic to Stirling and beyond had used the route to Polmont and Carmuirs, joining the Scottish Central Railway there, although the Edinburgh and Northern Railway route, involving two ferry crossings was available from 1847, and the NBR opened a route from Ratho to South Queensferry in 1866, enabling a crossing of the Firth of Forth by ferry there. The northwards routes were greatly simplified when the Forth Bridge was opened in 1890. A more direct route from Edinburgh to Dalmeny, at the south end of the bridge, was provided as part of the work; it left the E&GR; main line at Saughton. The intervening terrain between Edinburgh and Glasgow, served largely by the former Monkland Railways lines, but also by several mineral branches of the E&GR; main line, was mostly given over to coal and iron pits, and ironworks. While some extensions were constructed to serve new or expanded pits, the best times for the industries in the area had gone, and decline over several decades set in. As the industrial sites closed, so did the railway connections. In greater Glasgow, the North British Railway very gradually built up a suburban passenger network, and served industrial sites on the north bank of the River Clyde west of Glasgow. The great improvement took place when Airdrie and Coatbridge were connected directly to Glasgow in 1870. These developments put increasing pressure on the Queen Street terminus, which was still very cramped. This was finally resolved when the Glasgow City and District Railway was opened in 1896, allowing trains to run through Glasgow without entering a terminus station. =The twentieth century= In 1902 a branch line was opened to Corstorphine, serving a growing residential suburb of Edinburgh. At the \\"grouping\\" of the railways, the North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923, following the Railways Act 1921. In turn the LNER was nationalised as part of British Railways, Scottish Region in 1948. The direct line through Falkirk High was closed between 9 March 1980 and 8 December 1980 for tunnel repairs and the installation of slab track; for the time being through trains ran via Grahamston. =Dieselisation= From 7 January 1957, Swindon-built inter-city diesel multiple units were introduced; running in six car formations, they operated the fast trains between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The new trains were a considerable success, and the unit formation avoided the engine run-round and disposal moves at each end of the journey, which was especially useful at Glasgow because of the tunnel constraint. The journey time was 55 minutes. Although the new trains were a considerable advance over what had gone before, by the end of the 1960s they were perceived as inadequate, and trials were undertaken with a class 37 locomotive in push and pull mode; but this was not considered successful and pairs of class 27 locomotives were used instead, with mark II coaches. One locomotive was marshalled at each end of the train. This system was introduced from 3 May 1971, and reduced the journey time to 43 minutes. After some years the class 27 locomotives were suffering persistent failures due to the heavy use, and new arrangements were put in hand from 1979 using single class 47/7 locomotives, specially converted from class 47/4. A driving trailer (DBSO) was used at the remote end of the train, and control was effected through the lighting circuits. The maximum speed was 95 mph (153 km/h). The full service on this arrangement started in December 1980. The next generation was class 158 diesel multiple units, which were introduced in 1990, making the journey in 50 minutes with three stops. =The present day= The original main line between Edinburgh and Glasgow is in operation, with a frequent fast passenger train service between the two cities. The route via Grahamston is also in use. The Edinburgh and Bathgate line was closed to passengers in 1956 but has reopened as part of an electrified route between Edinburgh and Glasgow via Bathgate and Airdrie. The other sections of line built by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway have closed. Topography Edinburgh Waverley to Haymarket was opened on 1 August 1846.

Almond Valley Viaduct is the longest structure on the E&GR; main line; it was constructed in a 20-month period. It is in two sections separated by a high embankment about a quarter mile in length. The eastern section consists of 36 ashlar-faced segmental arches of 50 feet span, and the line is on a sweeping curve of about 2,500 yards radius. The spandrels have been strengthened by steel spandrel ties. The western section is of 7 arches, and the centre span bridges the Edinburgh to Bathgate road. This arch of 66 feet span has been badly affected by subsidence in connection with shale extraction. The contractor for the construction was John Gibb. The contract included Winchburgh tunnel and cutting, and he lost ¬£40,000 on the estimate as his calculation contained an error; he discovered this before his tender was accepted, but he felt an obligation to honour the tender offer. Winchburgh Tunnel is 367 yards long. It took 24 months to construct. Firedamp was a problem in the construction and a workman was badly burned. The Myers Burn west of the tunnel passes under the line in twin inverted siphons. Cowlairs tunnel is actually in three parts, Bell's Park (272 yards), Asylum (292 yards) and Broomhill (476 yards).

Miller's participation in his only Test came as a result of his touring South Africa in 1895-96. The early England tours to South Africa comprised mostly good minor county or club cricketers, with a small number of first-class cricketers thrown in. The games were only given Test status retrospectively. Miller was one of the non-regular-first-class players on the tour, and he made his first-class and Test debut in the 1st Test at Port Elizabeth in February 1896, scoring 4 not out and 20 not out. Due to the bowling of George Lohmann (7-38 and 8-7, including a Test hat-trick)), England won easily, by 288 runs. Miller stood as an umpire in the remaining two Tests of the tour, the 2nd Test at Johannesburg and the 3rd Test at Cape Town, both played in March 1896. Both matches were largely dominated by Lohmann's bowling (9-28 and 3-43, 7-42 and 1-45), and won by England by an innings. These were the only Test or first-class matches in which Miller stood as an umpire. After he returned to England, Miller played four more first- class games over the period to 1903, all for the Marylebone Cricket Club. He subsequently played for Wiltshire County Cricket Club and was team captain until 1920. His nephew, Thomas Miller played first-class cricket for Gloucestershire County Cricket Club between 1902 and 1914.

The town is important because it has a port, the Rosignol Stelling, that used to be the main crossing point on the western bank of the Berbice River. It is also a main stopping and exchange point for public transportation vehicles travelling along routes 50 and 53. New Amsterdam is on the east bank. The population consists primarily of people of Indian and African origin. Rosignol was home to two cinemas, the Atma and the Ritz (the latter of which burned down). The cinemas were popular in their heyday and patrons came from many miles and towns away. The cinemas' attraction faded with the introduction of VCRs and later with DVDs. Another major attraction was Hollywood Bar (Naggy's), which was owned by Edward Barratt. There were also Iris Chan bar (Mr. Chan's rum shop), and at one time Rosignol hosted the only gas station for entire West Berbice. It also at one point contained an adult entertainment house called Wellie's. Sweet Lips Disco is the life of the small nearby village. The town plays host to the biggest one day market (Saturday) in the Region. The huge Rosignol Fisheries is next to the stelling. As of 2013 the town had improved a lot, though poverty is still an issue. Many new businesses have popped up on land that was once bushy and unused, and have been cleared for building purposes and agricultural use due to an increase in population. It has developed from a quiet village to being quite busy. The recently constructed Berbice bridge has taken some of the life and importance of the old stelling but it still serves as a mode of transportation for people looking for a quick way to get across the river. There are some old buildings in the town that pose a threat to nearby buildings and are eyesores. Most are uninhabited or serve as living places for the few vagrants. Rosignol has three schools, a nursery school called Liberty hall Nursery, Rosignol Primary and Rosignol Secondary school.

It was developed with Sierra's Creative Interpreter. Being the first Sierra first-person adventure game, Shivers was compared to contemporary Myst and The 7th Guest, gaining praise mostly for its atmosphere. The game takes place in a fictitious haunted museum. Plot Sir Hubert Windlenot was a peer of the British nobility, and as an archeologist, a member of the Royal Society. His interest in controversial fringe topics such as ancient astronauts, hollow earth, Atlantis and cryptozoology brought on him the reputation of a mad scientist. Renouncing his life as a noble, he moved to America, and attempted to open \\"Professor Windlenot's Museum of the Strange and Unusual\\" in Mt. Pleasant, Ohio, dedicated to his findings and theories. Construction took two decades to house both exhibits and thematic installations with several puzzles to entertain the visitors (such as an Ancient Egyptian-themed artificial lake, an underground maze that leads to a Dero installation, a greenhouse, or a diorama dedicated to Atlantis). The museum was never completed until the Professor mysteriously disappeared. The player steps into the shoes of a teenager dared by his friends to spend the night on the grounds of the museum, that has been considered haunted. Upon entering and exploring the museum, it is discovered that \\"fifteen years ago\\", in 1980 and while the Professor was in one of his excursions, two nerds from the local high school had broken into the museum and accidentally released evil spirits from an exhibited set of ceramic vessels from the Moche Valley. These spirits, known as \\"ixupi\\", drew the \\"life essence\\" or \\"Ka\\" from humans until trapped by a fictional South American indigenous people, the Zapana. Furthermore, the Ixupi are associated with chemical elements and materials, such as sand, metal, wood or electricity, which they can inhabit. These led to the demise of the unfortunate teens, and eventually of the Professor himself. The player becomes tasked with finding a way to capture the ten spirits before the sun rises (though no actual time limit is imposed on the gameplay), and free the trapped ghosts of the Professor and the teens. This can be done by finding each vessel and its corresponding talisman/cover throughout all the museum, and where the respective Ixupi is hiding in order to trap it. In order to find all these items, the player has to explore the whole museum by passing puzzles of varying difficulty, mazes and secret passages. Along the way, the player can find in-game texts and documents chronicling the exploits of the Professor and the belongings of the two students expanding their backstory, with elements hinting at their lives, relationships and motivations. At the end of the game the player captures the Ixupi of electricity from the power generator, causing an explosion. From the destroyed ruins, the player sees the friends approaching, looking for their friend, as the dawn breaks. Gameplay The first area in the game Playing in first-person perspective, the game is remarkably similar in style to the Virgin Interactive/Trilobyte production, the popular The 7th Guest, which introduced this style of gaming. The only gameplay feature is an elaborate bar at the bottom of the screen which mostly serves as a health bar, showing how much \\"life essence\\" the player has or has lost; life is lost whenever the player encounters an Ixupi. It also serves as the game's inventory with the active Ixupi vessel or cover the player is currently holding, with the option to examine it in close-up. It also indicates progress in the game, as the vessels with the trapped Ixupi are placed there as trophies. The vessels and their covers are the only items that can be picked up and stored in the inventory. Uncommonly for an adventure game, the inventory can hold only one of these items: a vessel, a cover, or a vessel combined with its cover. This means that the player can pick up a vessel and then find and pick up its corresponding cover to complete it; but if the player attempts to pick up an item that can't be combined with the one held (i.e. another vessel or a cover corresponding to another vessel), the items will switch positions. This feature obliges the player to take notes of where he has found or dropped which item, and to travel back and forth in order to pick them up. Having a completed vessel the player can look for the corresponding Ixupi in order to trap it. Each vessel is marked with a Zapana pictograph representing a material, helping the player associate a vessel with an Ixupi. The locations where the items are found are mostly fixed every time, although which is where is mostly random, ensuring a different gameplay each time the game starts. A \\"Flashback\\" feature allows the player to review game cutscenes and re-read most of the in-game text that has been found, such as books from the museum library or the victims's notebooks. These not only advance the game's backstory but also contain hints to several of the puzzles. In a somewhat of a deviation from other FMV-based games of the era, dialogues are provided with closed captions. This was a suggestion by Lead Game Developer Willie Eide who came from a deaf family. Upon completion of the game's main story, the player may then continue to roam freely through the museum, with all captured Ixupis appearing along the health bar. One benefit of this is the luxury of getting to read over the many in game exhibit descriptions without the worry of being attacked by Ixupi. Reading these descriptions or exploring previously undiscovered parts of the museum can continue to add to the player's score. Development The game was programmed in SCI-32, the proprietary game engine/programming language by Sierra. A challenge faced by the team was the steep learning curves, as many were inexperienced in 3d modeling or adventure game design, and it was the first time the SCI language was used for a 1st-person adventure video game. Roberta Williams served as creative consultant, which was during the time she was working on Phantasmagoria. =Themes= Designer Marcia Bales credited her interest in travels and archeology as her main drive force for the game. Some of the footage seen in a cutscene were taken by Bales herself during a trip in Belize around 1994. Regarding the themes seen in the fictional museum, Bales claimed that most of them presented are factual, although stretched out in the way the Professor-based his pseudoscientific theories. The way the museum was designed, with each room assigned to a different artist, reflected the Professor's deductive fallacies of connecting otherwise unconnected facts to draw his conclusions. The elements were left for the player to decide how much of the Professor's theories were arbitrary. The concept of the Ixupi was a retelling of an almost universal motif of vampiric spirits sucking the life out of humans, often coming out of the elements. The Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul was also an inspiration. =Gameplay= Shivers was the first 1st person adventure game by Sierra On-Line that featured a nameless and unseen silent protagonist, instead of a visible player character. Bales mentioned the game Mixed-Up Mother Goose Deluxe as an inspiration to design Shivers as an open-ended game, with the random elements enhancing the non-linear gameplay; a characteristic considered uncommon for an adventure game. Once entering the museum, the player is immediately free to explore and access almost all locations, without having to solve a puzzle to see what is next. The player's order of actions are the factor of how the backstory elements are revealed, without mattering the order these are discovered. =Graphics= The game was created using scans of watercolors - some 2500 of them - touched up in Photoshop, along with 3D Studio. Each room was assigned to one out of a team of ten artists with the Art Director ensuring continuity and consistency. The cutscenes were filmed with live actors in front of a blue screen, who were superimposed on the digital backgrounds with Ultimatte. Each filming would require proper camera angles and lensing before shooting to ensure matching quality with the digital background. Occasionally masonite props would stand for foreground objects. The actors were found by talent agencies and were coached by Bales, producer Wendy Albee and director Tony Ober. =Sound and music= Guy Whitmore worked as a sound engineer, sound designer and music composer for the video game soundtrack. According to context, some pieces were composed as orchestral music whereas others were more modern. Some bands were cited as inspiration, such as Nine Inch Nails. Whitmore also had Dark Ambient music in mind. The interactive nature of the game demanded for a repetitive motif which would provide the background and foreboding mood of suspension for the player, while being unnoticed in the same time. The crescendo happens in the cues whenever the player triggers an attack of an Ixupi monster. Sound effects were derived mostly from a stock sound effects CD. The mumblings heard in the abandoned theatre is a relevant speech by the Ghost from a Hamlet performance. Reception Shivers drew mostly praise for its atmosphere. Presenting a deviation from earlier Sierra titles, the game was both praised and criticized for the same reasons, while it also drew comparisons with Myst and The 7th Guest. It holds an aggregated 72.2% score on GameRankings, based on reviews from various professional critics. Quandary gave the game a 5 out of 5, praising the atmosphere and simplicity of gameplay, mentioning the ample number of save game slots and closed captions among the game's advantages. A reviewer for Next Generation, while briefly complimenting the graphics and interface, derided the game as an unoriginal Myst clone. He added that \\"the long load times, grating music, and overreaching puzzles keep it mediocre at best.\\" French site Jeuxvideo.com called it \\"an undeniable success\\". In a retrospective review, Adventure Lantern noted that the game still looked fairly pleasant after its time, and its (mostly) clever design, while praising the game's mood and atmospheric soundtrack. Adventure Classic Gaming named Shivers a sleeper hit of the year and recognised its cult status. Ron Dulin of GameSpot criticized the gameplay repetitive as the player was forced to travel back and forth many times after a certain point. Ray Ivey of Just Adventure favored the game's atmosphere, and praised the \\"Flashback\\" feature. All Game Guide described it as \\"lacking\\" while the Finnish Pelit considered it an example of Sierra's downward spiral, criticizing the puzzles and the storyline. Sequel Shivers was followed in 1997 by Shivers II: Harvest of Souls which takes place in a ghost town.

Chauvel has also co-authored two books, the New Zealand Employment Law Guide (LexisNexis, 2002) and Employment Mediation (Thomson Brookers, 2005).Minter Ellison Rudd Watts News ; Prior to entering Parliament, Chavuel was on the board of Minter Ellison Rudd Watts (2003‚Äì2005) and became a partner in the Minter Ellison Legal Group in 2000. The 2005/06 edition of the Asia Pacific Legal 500 listed him as a \\"Leading Individual\\" in employment law. Other involvements Chauvel was a board member of the New Zealand Aids Foundation from 1990 to 1994, serving as chair in 1996. He was appointed in 1995 to the Board of the New Zealand Public Health Commission; as Deputy Chair of the New Zealand Lotteries Commission, and as Deputy Chair of Meridian Energy in 2005, having served as a director of that company from 2002. Politics With former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark A member of the Labour Party since 1985, Chauvel has held a number of Labour Party positions including Chair of the Princes Street Branch, President of Young Labour (then known as Labour Socialist Youth), membership of the Party's controlling body (the New Zealand Council) and Policy council and co-Chair of Rainbow Labour. Chauvel stood as Labour's electoral candidate for , in 1990 losing to the National Party's Bill Birch.

He gave his valedictory statement on 27 February 2013. He was succeeded in parliament by the next candidate on the Labour party list, Carol Beaumont. =Repeal of the Provocation Defence= The issue of provocation received much publicity in New Zealand due to the high-profile trials of Clayton Weatherston and Ferdinand Ambach, both of whom attempted to plead provocation in court (the latter successfully). The repeal of the partial defence of provocation to murder (s169 of the Crimes Act 1961) had been one of Chauvel's personal issues since entering Parliament. The Law Commission, in its 2007 report on the issue, also argued for repeal. In 2009 Chauvel and fellow Labour MP Lianne Dalziel worked together in an attempt to pass a Member's Bill repealing the provocation defence. The bill was \\"effectively adopted\\" by the Government.Getting rid of the 'Gay panic defence' Retrieved 7 February 2010 The Crimes (Provocation Repeal) Amendment Bill passed on Thursday 26 November 2009 with 116 votes to five; the ACT Party voicing the only opposition. Some submitters, including the New Zealand Law Society, viewed the repeal as a knee-jerk reaction to two specific cases. However, Chauvel had articulated a different view, that the defence had been used inappropriately for a number of years, both in New Zealand and overseas, in prosecutions over the murder of gay men, and could no longer be justified.Chauvel Charles Charles Chauvel MP: Good riddance to the 'Gay Panic Defence' 26 November 2009 Retrieved 30 May 2013 References External links * * Videos of speeches made by Chauvel in Parliament * Parliamentary Profile of Chauvel Category:LGBT members of the Parliament of New Zealand Category:New Zealand Labour Party MPs Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:Victoria University of Wellington alumni Category:New Zealand lawyers Category:People from Gisborne, New Zealand Category:People educated at Gisborne Boys' High School Category:Gay politicians Category:New Zealand list MPs Category:Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand people of French descent Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 2005 New Zealand general election Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1990 New Zealand general election Category:Contestants on New Zealand game shows Category:21st- century New Zealand politicians ","title":"Charles Chauvel (politician)"},{"id":"2538442","text":"Ratibor or Ratibo≈ô may refer to: People *Ratibor (Polabian prince) (died 1043), a prince of the Obotrite confederacy from the Polabian tribe *Ratibor I, Duke of Pomerania (1124‚Äì1156), duke of the House of Pomerania (Griffins) *Ratibor II, Duke of Pomerania (died after 1223), a Pomeranian duke, son of Ratibor I Places *Ratibor, the German name of Racib√≥rz, a town in the Silesian Voivodeship, southern Poland *Ratibo≈ô (Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec District), a village and municipality (obec) in the Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec District in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic *Ratibo≈ô (Vset√≠n District), a village and municipality (obec) in the Vset√≠n District in the Zl√≠n Region of the Czech Republic *Duchy of Ratibor, was one of the duchies of Silesia * Ratibor, Texas is a small community in Central Texas Other uses *Schloss Ratibor, castle in Roth, Germany *SV Ratibor 03, was a German association football club from the city of Ratibor, Upper Silesia (today Racib√≥rz, Poland) ","title":"Ratibor"},{"id":"2538448","text":"Ronald Reagan receiving a concession phone call from Walter Mondale after the 1984 United States presidential election. In politics, a concession is the act of a losing candidate publicly yielding to a winning candidate after an election after the overall result of the vote has become clear. History The first \\"concession telegram\\" occurred when William Jennings Bryan sent William McKinley two days after the 1896 US presidential election. Prior to that election results took many days and thus candidates maintained an air of detachment from the process. Concession speech In the broadcast age, the concession speech of a candidate for high office reaches a wide audience and is seen as the final swan song of a lost campaign. Out of courtesy, the winner of the campaign usually waits for a concession speech, if one is forthcoming, before delivering the acceptance speech. A losing candidate usually thanks their supporters for their valiant efforts and points to the non-electoral successes of the campaign in building party strength and raising issues to attention that would not otherwise be in public discussion. It is also traditional, unless the campaign has been exceptionally bitter, to congratulate and wish well the winning candidate, perhaps even offering a parting word of advice.Myers-Gallardo, Alfonso (2014) El consentimiento pol√≠tico de los perdedores y su rol en la democracia, Universidad de Salamanca, UNAM Fes Acatl√°n, Ed. Ratio Legis, Espa√±a. https://www.academia.edu/31906054/El_consentimiento_Pol%C3%ADtico_de_los_Perdedores_Su_rol_en_la_Democracia Timing of concession If the vote is relatively close, it can be unclear when it is appropriate for a losing candidate to concede an election. On election night, pressures from a media looking for news to report, an opposition campaign anxious to declare victory, and one's own campaign unwilling to concede defeat if there is any hope of a last-minute turnaround all weigh on the decision of the losing candidate. It is exceedingly rare for a concession, once issued, to be retracted; such an event occurred in the United States 2000 presidential election, when Democratic candidate Al Gore, Jr. telephoned Republican George W. Bush to concede the contest. Gore was apparently unaware of the close vote count in the state of Florida, and when he realized it, he proceeded to cancel his concession address. A losing candidate commonly offers a private concession directly to the winning candidate, usually by telephone, before any public announcement is made. Refusal to concede Concession is entirely optional, and candidates sometimes refuse to concede defeat despite the vote count being against them, especially if they suspect electoral fraud. In that case, the candidate would likely demand a recount of the votes or other investigations into the alleged fraud. Sometimes, concession may be denied not because of any specific fraud allegations but simply because of ill will accumulated over the campaign. It is not necessary for the losing candidate to concede for the winning candidate to be seated, and the losing candidate is not obliged to concede once defeat has been conclusively demonstrated.

He was elected to eight consecutive terms, having served from 1949 to 1965. Background Elliott was born in rural Franklin County in northwest Alabama. He graduated at the age of sixteen from Vina High School in Vina in Franklin County. Few expected him to be able to afford college because of the Great Depression. However, the University of Alabama, under its president George H. Denny, allowed young Elliott to work at a variety of jobs about campus to pay his educational expenses. In 1933, he received his undergraduate degree, and he subsequently enrolled at the University of Alabama School of Law, also located in Tuscaloosa. While a law student, Elliott ran for the high-profile position of president of the Student Government. With the support of the growing number of out-of-state students and women, Elliott became the first person ever to defeat \\"the Machine\\", a select coalition of fraternities and sororities that to this day dominates campus politics at the university. In 1936, Elliott completed his term as SGA president and graduated with his law degree. Legal and congressional career Elliott then began his law practice in Russellville near his hometown but soon moved to the community that he would call home for the remainder of his life: Jasper in Walker County, Alabama. As an attorney in Jasper, Elliott spent most of his time representing coal miners and their families, foreshadowing his long political career of fighting for Alabama's poorest, most disadvantaged people. He served in the United States Army from 1942 to 1944. He was twice elected a local judge in Jasper before he ran for Congress in 1948. His \\"Farm Boy to Congress\\" persona proved popular among the working class in his district, and in 1948, he unseated Representative Carter Manasco, to the surprise of many political observers. Upon winning the election, Elliott and his wife purchased a residence in the nation's capital and spent the next sixteen years traveling back and forth between Washington, D.C., and Jasper. Elliott represented Alabama's 7th congressional district. He served on the House Veterans Committee, the Education and Labor Committee, and the Rules Committee. He chaired the Select Committee for Government Research. In 1956, Elliott authored the Library Services Act, which brought mobile libraries (bookmobiles) and continuing library service to millions of rural Americans. The same year, he was one of 101 politicians to sign the Southern Manifesto in opposition to racial integration of public places. In 1957, he voted against the Civil Rights Act.http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/85-1957/h42 In 1958, he co-authored the National Defense Education Act, which, in the wake of the U.S.S.R.'s early post-Sputnik lead in the Space Race, improved science, foreign language, and technology education nationwide and provided low-interest loans for college and graduate school for needy students. Both laws have been extended; more than 30 million college students nationwide have obtained loans under Elliott's NDEA legislation. In 1960 and 1964, he voted against the Civil Rights Acts of those years.https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/88-1964/h182 Other political races Alabama had failed to redistrict itself from nine to eight districts in 1962, based on the 1960 census. Primaries were held in each of the nine districts, and a statewide runoff election narrowed the number elected to eight. By the time of the 1964 primaries, a redistricting plan still had not passed, so Elliott defeated later 7th District Representative Tom Bevill in a primary. Then in the statewide runoff, Elliott was the congressman who was eliminated. His defeat was attributed to his policy conflicts with then Governor George C. Wallace. Alabama passed a redistricting plan after the runoff primary to avert a second statewide general election. In the 1964 congressional general election, the Democrat George C. Hawkins, the president pro tempore of the Alabama State Senate, was defeated by the Republican James D. Martin, an oil products distributor from Gadsden. Martin had made a strong but losing race in 1962 against U.S. Senator J. Lister Hill. Some Elliott backers threatened to withhold votes from Hawkins or even to vote for Martin on the theory that Elliott might be able to reclaim the House seat in 1966 if he were pitted against a Republican in the historically Democratic district.Billy Hathorn, \\"James Douglas Martin and the Alabama Republican Resurgence, 1962-1965\\", Gulf Coast Historical Review, Vol. 8, No. 2 (Spring 1993), p. 65 However, in 1966, Elliott did not run for Congress against Martin; nor did Martin seek reelection to the U.S. House. Instead, Elliott and Martin were unsuccessful candidates for governor. Elliott and three other prominent Democrats, Attorney General Richmond Flowers, Sr. and former governors James Folsom and John Malcolm Patterson, lost their party's nomination to Lurleen Burns Wallace, the surrogate candidate of her husband, George Wallace, who was ineligible to succeed himself at that time. Lurleen Wallace then defeated Martin in the gubernatorial general election. In his gubernatorial bid, Elliott stressed federal assistance to the needy, improved education, and racial tolerance. In the campaign, he faced bomb threats, defaced campaign billboards, and Ku Klux Klan protest appearances at several of his speeches. Death and legacy After Elliott's defeat, he slipped into political obscurity, having spent his congressional pension on the failed gubernatorial bid. He resumed practicing law, writing books about local history, producing columns and book reviews for area newspapers, and publishing books by local authors. His books include five volumes of Annals of Northwest Alabama, a history of Red Bay, Alabama, and seven volumes on the history of area coal miners. In 1990, Elliott received new recognition of his achievements when he became the first recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award; the second in 1991 was U.S. Representative Charles Weltner, another civil rights advocate from Georgia. In the twilight of his life, he received long-sought vindication when he was able to travel to Boston, Massachusetts, to accept the award from then U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy. His autobiography, The Cost of Courage: The Journey of An American Congressman, written with journalist Michael D'Orso and published in 1992, was reprinted by the University of Alabama Press. A one-hour television special, Conscience of a Congressman: The Life and Times of Carl Elliott, was produced as an episode of The Alabama Experience documentary series by the University of Alabama Center for Public Television & Radio.

The island lies in the Town of Clayton, near its border with the Town of Orleans, in the northern part of Jefferson County. Today Murray Isle is the site of many summer cottages. While the record is unclear, it is believed that the first cottage on Murray Isle was built in 1860. The structure, a simple log cabin, was owned by Daniel Sherman. By 1880, the island had four cottages, all located upriver, on the northern portion of the island. Murray was formerly known as Hemlock Island due to the presence of that variety of tree, but the name was changed in the late 18th century to Murray Hill Park after the Murray Hill area of New York City when the island was developed and lots sold off. The development was never finished. The name was shortened to its present form some time later. Murray Hill Hotel lawn, from 1907 postcard The Murray Hill Hotel was built on the island in the late 19th century, and served tourists who came over on steam ships from Clayton, NY through the early 20th century when it closed and was ultimately torn down. Today a community house and post office sit on the former site of the hotel. The post office operates yearly from June until September. An annual \\"Fish Fry\\" is hosted on the grounds of the community house every summer; the event takes place on the first Saturday of July. Murray Isle is bounded by channels on both its eastern and western tips. The channel on the island's eastern tip, known as \\"The Narrows\\" separates Murray Isle and Wellesley Island. A small islet known as Wintergreen Island (formerly Whippoorwill Island) is connected by a footbridge along the southern length of Murray.

Details of killings All three victims were shot with a .25 caliber pistol which belonged to a man that Newton had been seeing at the time. Newton claimed that an illegal drug trader/drug dealer killed the three. The Houston police presented evidence that Newton's husband was a drug dealer and was in debt to his supplier. Newton maintained her innocence from her first interrogation in 1987 until her execution in 2005. Three weeks before the slayings, Newton had purchased life insurance policies on her husband, her daughter, and herself. These were each worth $50,000. She named herself as beneficiary on her husband's and daughter's policies. Newton claimed she forged her husband's signature to prevent him from discovering that money had been set aside to pay the premiums. Prosecutors cited these facts as the basis for her motive. Newton was also found to have placed a paper bag containing the murder weapon in a relative's home shortly after the murders. On October 25, 1988, Newton was convicted of the murders and sentenced to death; she spent nearly 18 years on death row before finally being executed by lethal injection on September 14, 2005. Death row Mountain View Unit, where Newton was held Two hours before her first scheduled execution on December 1, 2004, Texas Governor Rick Perry granted a 120-day reprieve to allow more time to test forensic evidence in the case. There were also conflicting reports as to whether a second gun was recovered from the scene; ballistics reports appeared to demonstrate that a gun recovered by law enforcement and allegedly connected to Newton after the offense was the murder weapon. A relative of Newton who was incarcerated shortly after the murders claimed a person he shared a cell with boasted of killing the family. Numerous individuals, including three members of the convicting jury, expressed concern over evidence that was not presented during the trial. On August 24, 2005, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals turned down a motion for a stay of execution. It turned down another appeal on September 9 for writ of habeas corpus. It was her fourth application. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 7‚Äì0 on September 12 not to recommend that her sentence be commuted to life imprisonment, despite evidence raising doubt about her guilt and a letter from her husband's parents asking that her life be spared. The same day the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit refused an appeal of her sentence. Her new attorney, David Dow, asked Governor Perry for a 30-day stay to prove that Newton was wrongly linked to the murder weapon. The Supreme Court of the United States declined without dissent two appeals on September 13. Execution Huntsville Unit, where Newton was executed The execution was carried out as scheduled on September 14, 2005 by lethal injection. Frances Newton spent a little more than 17 and a half years on death row before her execution, and was the third woman executed in Texas since the resumption of capital punishment in the state in 1982. The first and second were Karla Faye Tucker and Betty Lou Beets. Like Beets before her, Newton made no final statement and did not have a last meal request. Over 30 protesters from the Texas Death Penalty Abolition Movement, the National Black United Front, and the New Black Panther Party had gathered outside the prison. In addition, about 75 people protested the execution outside the governor's mansion in Austin. According to the results of a Public Information Act request submitted by Texas Moratorium Network to the office of Governor Rick Perry, 12,201 people contacted the governor asking him to stop Newton's execution and 10 people contacted him in support of her execution. During the investigation of Frances Newton, the forensic crime lab in the Houston Police Department was also experiencing intense criticism for the handling of evidence. Michael R. Bromwich, a former U.S. Justice Department official, said the Houston Police Department and city officials \\"failed to provide the crime lab with adequate resources to meet growing demands\\" for at least 15 years before the exposure of problems in its DNA division. Newton's story was featured in the Fatal Attraction episode \\"A Lethal Love.\\" It is the seventeenth episode of the program's third season. It has also been featured on Deadly Women. She is also featured in \\"Women on Death Row\\", where her guilt is put into question and her innocence was discussed before she was executed.

This geometry reduces the amount of pathlength compensation required when re-pointing the interferometer array (in fact a Mertz corrector can be used rather than delay lines), but otherwise is little different from other existing instruments. He has suggested a space-based interferometer array much larger (and complex) than the Darwin and Terrestrial Planet Finder projects using this spherical geometry of array elements along with a densified pupil beam combiner, calling the endeavor a \\"Hypertelescope\\"Laboratoire pour l‚ÄôInterf√©rom√©trie Stellaire et Exoplan√©taire: Hypertelescope project.

Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Idlib Governorate. History The settlement was established in the fourth century at an important trade route between Antioch and Apamea. Due to good location and excellent conditions to produce wine and olive oil, it flourished in the 5th and 6th centuries. When Muslims conquered the region and trading routes were disrupted and other Dead Cities were abandoned, Bara remained inhabited, most inhabitants remained Christians, and the town even became a seat of a bishopric subordinate of Antioch under Peter of Narbonne. In 1098, it was conquered by crusaders (from there they later set off to the infamous cannibalistic massacre of Ma\`arat al- Numan) led by Raymond de Saint-Gilles. The town was taken by Ridwan in 1104 and retaken by Tancred a year later. However, it was retaken by Muslims from 1119 to 1122. In 1123, the town was reconquered by Belek Ghazi who built a small fortress. By 1130, it was retaken by the crusaders of Antioch until it was finally controlled by Nur ad-Din in 1148. Later in the 12th century, after a severe earthquake, the town was abandoned. Later, in the beginning of the 20th century, a modern village of the same name arose near the site of the ancient town and till today it has grown to the size of a small town. Ruins are the most extensive of all Dead Cities and are scattered among fields, olive groves and orchards. Among many others, one can distinguish remains of at least five churches, three monasteries, several villas, two pyramidal tombs and one underground tomb.

He plays all three outfield positions. Early life Aguila was born to a Filipino father and a mother of Samoan, Tongan, and Fijian descent. He played high school baseball for McQueen High School in Reno, Nevada, where he set a single-season home run record. As a senior, he was a first-team High School All-American as a designated hitter. Professional baseball career =Florida Marlins= The Florida Marlins selected Aguila as a third baseman in the third round of the MLB draft out of McQueen High School in Reno, Nevada; he had set a single-season home run record while at McQueen. Although he was initially a highly regarded prospect, he spent two seasons playing rookie ball in the Gulf Coast League and 2¬Ω more seasons in Single-A before he was promoted to the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs. He became an outfielder during the 1999 season, when he played for the Kane County Cougars. When he started playing for Portland in , he was in his fifth professional season, but was still only 22 years old. He batted .257 in 64 games with Portland. He returned to the Sea Dogs in and posted a .294 average. The Marlins switched their Double-A affiliation to the Carolina Mudcats the following year, and Aguila spent with the Mudcats, posting a .320 batting average in 93 games. It was then that Aguila once again showed his potential as a hitter, and the Marlins would invite him to their spring training in . Although Aguila did not make the Marlins' opening day roster in 2004, he impressed Marlins manager Jack McKeon, and he batted .312 for Triple-A Albuquerque. He had two stints in the Majors in 2004, paving the way for him to make the Marlins' opening day roster in . In 2005, Aguila was named the Marlins' fifth outfielder (behind Miguel Cabrera, Juan Pierre, Juan Encarnaci√≥n, and Jeff Conine), but was used mainly in a pinch-hitting role. He logged only 16 at bats in the first two months of the season, and he was sent back to Albuquerque on May 27. While in Albuquerque, he regained his everyday role as the team's center fielder. He batted .351 with 7 home runs and 25 RBI in 35 games with Albuquerque, and he was promoted back to the Major Leagues on July 7, when the Marlins placed Josh Willingham on the disabled list. He spent the rest of the season in the Major Leagues, mainly as a pinch hitter; he started only 12 games all year, most of them while Encarnaci√≥n was injured. He finished the 2005 season with a .244 batting average, no home runs, and 4 RBI in 78 at bats. Following the 2005 season, he played for Gigantes del Cibao in the Dominican Winter League. Several signs pointed to Aguila's receiving more playing time in . Toward the end of the season, teammate A. J. Burnett ripped Marlins manager Jack McKeon for several reasons, one of which was that McKeon gave most of the available playing time to aging veterans, rather than to younger players such as Aguila, Willingham, and Jeremy Hermida, who had proven themselves already in the minor leagues, but had not received extended playing time in the Majors. Also, Encarnaci√≥n became a free agent following the 2005 season, and Juan Pierre was traded to the Chicago Cubs, so Aguila was put in a position to compete for a starting job in the Marlins' outfield in 2006. In addition, McKeon retired after the last game of the 2005 season, and the Marlins named 41-year-old Joe Girardi as his replacement. Aguila made the Marlins' opening-day roster again in 2006. While Hermida was sidelined, Aguila got most of the at bats in right field until the Marlins signed Joe Borchard; afterwards, Aguila was part of a platoon in center field with Eric Reed and Reggie Abercrombie. (Although Willingham occasionally started at catcher, he started most of the Marlins' games in left field) Reed struggled, going 4-for-35 (.114) at the plate, and was sent down to Albuquerque. Meanwhile, Abercrombie went on an 11-game hitting streak, which further decreased the amount of playing time Aguila was receiving; Aguila started in only three of the club's next 16 games after May 3. On May 26, the Marlins acquired Cody Ross from the Cincinnati Reds for a player to be named later; to free a roster spot for Ross, they optioned Aguila to Albuquerque. During his time with the Marlins up to that point, he had batted .229 (19-for-83) with two stolen bases, seven doubles, a triple, no home runs, and seven RBI. In 13 games with Albuquerque, he batted .383 (18-for-47) with one home run (a grand slam) and drove in 13 runs, before he was recalled by the Marlins to replace Willingham, who had gone on the disabled list. After a second stint with the Marlins, he returned to Albuquerque for the rest of the Isotopes' season, where he finished the year there with a .318 batting average, 11 home runs, and 59 RBI in 77 games. After the Isotopes' season ended, the Marlins placed him back on their Major League roster. He appeared in eight games with the Marlins in September, batting 3-for-9 to raise his batting average for the year to .232. He did not start any more games for the Marlins in 2006 after returning to the majors, but he did hit 2-for-3 with a single and a double in their season- ending win against the Philadelphia Phillies. On October 13, 2006, the Marlins outrighted Aguila to Albuquerque, which removed him from their 40-man roster. Since he was out of options on his contract, he needed to make the Marlins' opening day roster in in order to remain in their organization for a 10th season. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Instead of remaining with the Marlins, he signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates on December 10, 2006, with an invitation to spring training. He joined the Pirates in spring training as a non-roster invitee, but did not make the team out of camp; and played for their Triple-A club, the Indianapolis Indians, where he hit (.250/.291/.360/651 in 172 at bats). =New York Mets= Aguila was signed by the New York Mets in March 2008, and he was assigned to their Triple-A team, New Orleans Zephyrs. On June 11, Aguila was called up from Triple-A New Orleans to the Major League team to replace Abraham N√∫√±ez who was designated for assignment, but he too was designated for assignment after appearing in only three games. On July 11 Aguila was again designated for assignment, and on July 15 he was sent outright to the minors. =Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks= He became a minor league free agent at the end of the season and was signed by the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. =Toronto Blue Jays/Philadelphia Phillies= He signed as a free agent with the Toronto Blue Jays on March 15, 2010 but after 44 games with the Las Vegas 51s, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. =Florida/Miami Marlins= He rejoined the Marlins organization as a free agent on August 26, 2010. In 2011 and 2012, he played for the New Orleans Zephyrs in the Marlins system. =Fortitudo Baseball Bologna= He signed with Fortitudo Baseball Bologna of the Italian Baseball League in 2013.

Yusuf al-Mu'taman reigned during the height of power of Muslim Zaragoza, following the thriving period of his father Ahmad al-Muqtadir. He continued his father's efforts and created around him a court of intellectuals, living in the beautiful palace of Aljafer√≠a, nicknamed as \\"the palace of joy\\". Al-Mu'taman was also a scholarly king and a patron of science, philosophy and arts. He knew astrology, philosophy, and especially mathematics, a discipline in which he wrote the most important treatise from al-Andalus,Glick, Thomas F.; Livesey, Steven John; Wallis, Faith (2005). Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia. Psychology Press. p. 243. the Kitab al-Istikmal (\\"Book of Perfection\\"). Biography Yusuf was born on an unknown date, certainly in Zaragoza, in the palace of Aljaferia. When he ascended to the throne on the death of his father in 1081, the taifa of Zaragoza was at its peak. Al-Muqtadir divided his lands between his two sons: al-Mu'taman received the western part of the taifa with Zaragoza, Tudela, Huesca and Calatayud, while al-Mundhir received the coastal zone of the kingdom, including L√©rida, Monz√≥n, Tortosa and D√©nia. The first external concern of the king was the threat posed by the King of Aragon, Sancho Ram√≠rez who aimed to extend his territories to the south, at the expense of Zaragoza. Al-Mu'taman counted on the services of the mercenary troops of the Castilian lord El Cid, who had been exiled by King Alfonso VI for conducting raids against his interests in the Taifa of Toledo, then a tributary of the king. In 1081, El Cid therefore offered his service to the king of Zaragoza, al-Muqtadir, and remained with al-Mu'taman during his reign. Al-Mu'taman also assigned to El Cid the task of reincorporating into Zaragoza the eastern territories of his relative al-Mundhir, an ally of Aragon. Clashes in the border area were constant, but neither managed to reunite the paternal territory. El Cid contained the attacks of the Aragonese until 1083, when Sancho managed to take the line of fortifications that protected Zaragoza like Graus in the east, as well as Ayerbe, Bolea, Arascu√©s and Arguedas. El Cid served Yusuf al-Mu'tamin until 1086, when he broke his ties with Zaragoza. The circumstances in which he refused to continue serving al-Mu'tamin and his heir Ahmad II al-Musta øin are not fully clear and still debated. Al-Mu'taman also tried to strengthen relations with his vassal king of Valencia, Abu Bakr, through marriage alliances. But Valencia was entangled in a complex game of alliances. Alfonso VI, skilfully using diplomacy, got al-Kadir, the king of Toledo, to hand over the city in 1085 in exchange for his help to drive Abu Bakr from Valencia, which meant, in fact, the capture of Toledo for the king of Castile. Thus, the kingdom of Zaragoza was cut off from the rest of al- Andalus, which seriously weakened its economy and made it even more vulnerable to Christian attacks. The year of loss of Valencia was also the year of the death of Yusuf al-Mu'tamin. Intellectual life Although it was common practice for royals to be well educated, both al-Mu'taman and his father were exceptional mathematicians. In medieval Islam, there was a wave of translations of ancient Greek texts, ranging from philosophy, to medicine, to astronomy, and the more influential mathematical texts. Both father and son, as well as medieval Islamic translators such as the Banu Musa were known for their expansions on ancient Greek and Roman ideals. There was a stigma in the periods following medieval Islam that Islamic scholars only copied the ancient texts, offering no intellectual addition. Later it was proven that scholars such as Ibn Qurra and al-Mu'taman offered their own input and original contributions beyond their transmission of ancient ideas. =Mathematics= Ceva's theorem, discovered at the end of the 11th century by al-Mutaman. The main work of al-Mu'taman was his Book of Perfection (Kitab al-Istikmal). This book was a compendium of the Greek mathematics of Euclid and Archimedes among others, but also contained the teachings of Thabit ibn Qurra, the Banu Musa and Ibn al-Haytham, and also introduced some original theorems. The Kitab al- Istikmal is an uncompleted work but it was still seen as an important work from the eleventh-century king. The encyclopedist Ibn al-Akfani said that had the Istikmal been completed, it would have made the existing geometrical literature superfluous. Furthermore, Ibn Aknin, postulated that the Istikmal needs to be read by mathematicians alongside the Elements of Euclid, On the Sphere and Cylinder of Archimedes, and the Conics of Apollonius, to name a few. Because this was not a completed piece of work it was not appreciated nor taught to the masses like works from Euclid or Archimedes. The work has been sent to Egypt by Maimonides, and from there it spread to Baghdad in the 14th century, so its influence has not really affected the West. The Kitab al- Istikmal deals with irrational numbers, conic sections, quadrature of the parabolic segment, volumes and areas of various geometric objects, and the drawing of the tangent to a circle, among other mathematical problems. In the work appears an attempt to classify mathematics into Aristotelian categories. The classification includes a chapter for arithmetic, two chapters for geometry and two others for stereometry. Al-Mu'taman is the author of the first known formulation of Ceva's theorem, which was only known in Europe in 1678 in De lineis rectis by the Italian geometer Giovanni Ceva. It remains unknown whether Giovanni had discovered this geometry on his own or if he had found a translation of al-Mu'taman's treatise. The theorem can be stated as follows: \\"Let ABC be a triangle and D, E, F points on the sides BC, CA, and AB. We draw the lines AD, BE and CF. These three lines intersect at one point if and only if \\\\frac{AF}{FB}=\\\\frac{EA}{CE}\\\\frac{DC}{BD}.

It may also refer to the digestion of an enzyme by another molecule of the same enzyme. The term derives from the Greek Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø- (\\"self\\") and ŒªœçœÉŒπœÇ (\\"splitting\\").  Cell destruction  Autolytic cell destruction is uncommon in living adult organisms and usually occurs in injured cells and dying tissue. Autolysis is initiated by the cells' lysosomes releasing digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm. These enzymes are released due to the cessation of active processes in the cell, not as an active process. In other words, though autolysis resembles the active process of digestion of nutrients by live cells, the dead cells are not actively digesting themselves as is often claimed and as the synonym self-digestion of autolysis seems to imply. Autolysis of individual cell organelles can be lessened if the organelle is stored in warm isotonic buffer after cell fractionation.  Use  In the healing of wounds, autolytic debridement can be a helpful process, where the body breaks down and liquifies dead tissue so that it can be washed or carried away. Modern wound dressings that help keep the wound moist can assist in this process. In the food industry, autolysis involves killing yeast and encouraging breakdown of its cells by various enzymes. The resulting autolyzed yeast is used as a flavoring or flavor enhancer. For yeast extract, when this process is triggered by the addition of salt, it is known as plasmolysis. In bread baking, the term (or, more commonly, its French cognate autolyse) is described as a period of rest following initial mixing of flour and water, before other ingredients (such as salt and yeast) are added to the dough. The term was coined by French baking professor Raymond Calvel, who recommended the procedure as a means of reducing kneading time, thereby improving the flavor and color of bread. Long kneading times subject bread dough to atmospheric oxygen, which bleaches the naturally occurring carotenoids in bread flour, robbing the flour of its natural creamy color and flavor. An autolyse also makes the dough easier to shape and improves structure. In the making of fermented beverages, autolysis can occur when the must or wort is left on the lees for a long time. In beer brewing, autolysis causes undesired off-flavors. Autolysis in winemaking is often undesirable, but in the case of the best Champagnes it is a vital component in creating flavor and mouth feel.J.

It is a multi-disciplinary field integrating disciplines such as biology, chemistry, physics, ecology, earth science, atmospheric science, mathematics, and geography. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) states that EE is vital in imparting an inherent respect for nature amongst society and in enhancing public environmental awareness. UNESCO emphasises the role of EE in safeguarding future global developments of societal quality of life (QOL), through the protection of the environment, eradication of poverty, minimization of inequalities and insurance of sustainable development (UNESCO, 2014a). The term often implies education within the school system, from primary to post-secondary. However, it sometimes includes all efforts to educate the public and other audiences, including print materials, websites, media campaigns, etc.. There are also ways that environmental education is taught outside the traditional classroom. Aquariums, zoos, parks, and nature centers all have ways of teaching the public about the environment.  UNESCO and environmental awareness and education  UNESCO‚Äôs involvement in environmental awareness and education goes back to the very beginnings of the Organization, with the creation in 1948 of the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature, now the World Conservation Union), the first major NGO mandated to help preserve the natural environment. UNESCO was also closely involved in convening the UN International Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, Sweden in 1972, which led to the setting up of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Subsequently, for two decades, UNESCO and UNEP led the International Environmental Education Programme (1975-1995), which set out a vision for, and gave practical guidance on how to mobilize education for environmental awareness. In 1976, UNESCO launched an environmental education newsletter ‚ÄòConnect‚Äô as the official organ of the UNESCO-UNEP International Environmental Education Programme (IEEP). It served as a clearinghouse to exchange information on Environmental Education (EE) in general and to promote the aims and activities of the IEEP in particular, as well as being a network for institutions and individuals interested and active in environment education until 2007. The long-standing cooperation between UNESCO and UNEP on environmental education (and later ESD) also led to the co- organization of four major international conferences on environmental education since 1977: the First Intergovernmental Conference on Environmental Education in Tbilisi, Georgia (October 1977); the Conference ‚ÄúInternational Strategy for Action in the Field of Environmental Education and Training for the 1990s‚Äù in Moscow, Russian Federation (August 1987); the third International Conference ‚ÄúEnvironment and Society: Education and Public Awareness for Sustainability‚Äù at Thessaloniki, Greece (December 1997); and the Fourth International Conference on Environmental Education towards a Sustainable Future in Ahmedabad, India (November 2007). These meetings highlighted the pivotal role education plays in sustainable development. It was at the Tbilisi conference in 1977 that the essential role of ‚Äòeducation in environmental matters‚Äô (as stated in the recommendations of the 1972 Stockholm Conference) was fully explored. Organized by UNESCO in cooperation with UNEP, this was the world's first intergovernmental conference on environmental education. In the subsequent Tbilisi Declaration, environment was interpreted in its ‚Äòtotality‚Äînatural and built, technological and social (economic, political, cultural-historical, ethical, aesthetic)‚Äô (UNESCOUNEP, 1977, point 3). The goals formulated for environmental education went far beyond ecology in the curriculum and included development of a ‚Äòclear awareness of, and concern about, economic, social, political, and ecological interdependence in urban and rural areas‚Äô (ibid, point 2) which became one of the major bases of ESD.  Focus  Environmental education focuses on: 1\\\\. Engaging with citizens of all demographics to; 2\\\\. Think critically, ethically, and creatively when evaluating environmental issues; 3\\\\. Make educated judgments about those environmental issues; 4\\\\. Develop skills and a commitment to act independently and collectively to sustain and enhance the environment; and, 5\\\\. To enhance their appreciation of the environment; resulting in positive environmental behavioural change (Bamberg & Moeser, 2007; Wals et al., 2014).  Attributes  There are a few central qualities involved in environmental education that are useful contributions to the individual. Environmental education: # Enhances real-world problem solving. # Strengthens physical activity and diet quality. # Improves communication/leadership when working in groups.  Careers  There are various different career paths one could delve into within environmental education. Many of these careers require discovering and planning how to resolve environmental issues occurring in today's world. The location of someone with these careers has an impact on the clear responsibilities each must obtain depending on what environmental issue is most prevalent in the area. A general outlook of some careers in this field are: * Federal Government Park Ranger- Responsible for protecting the national parks, historical sites, and national seashores across the United States including the wildlife and ecosystems within them. There are many qualifications in order for one to become a park ranger and some include: obtaining a bachelor's degree and a passing grade in the PEB. Some focuses within this field include: enforcing park rules, giving tours to groups for educational purposes, and protecting parks from forest fires. * Outdoor Education Teacher- Teach students by using outdoor field and classroom work. Some invite guest speakers who are experts in their field to help teach how the basic principles of science are implemented in the real world. Some requirements for this career include becoming CPR certified and having a bachelor's degree in either environmental science or a field related to it. It can be a problematic field as there is no concurrence on the central concepts that are taught as well as teachers do not agree on what constitutes an important environmental issue. * Environmental Scientist- Use of field work to research contamination in nature when writing plans in creating projects for environmental research. Topics such as air pollution, water quality, as well as wildlife and how humans affect it are researched. Some requirements for this career are a bachelor's degree with a double major in environmental science and either biology, physics or chemistry. * Environmental Engineer- Involves the combination of biology/chemistry with engineering to generate ways to ensure the health of the planet. Scientific research is analyzed and projects are designed as a result of that research in order to come up with solutions to issues of the environment like air pollution. A bachelor's degree in civil engineering or general engineering is required as well as some experience in this field.  Related fields  Environmental education has crossover with multiple other disciplines. These fields of education complement environmental education yet have unique philosophies. * Citizen Science (CS) aims to address both scientific and environmental outcomes through enlisting the public in the collection of data, through relatively simple protocols, generally from local habitats over long periods of time (Bonney et al., 2009). * Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) aims to reorient education to empower individuals to make informed decisions for environmental integrity, social justice, and economic viability for both present and future generations, whilst respecting cultural diversities (UNESCO, 2014b). * Climate Change Education (CCE) aims in enhancing the public's understanding of climate change, its consequences, and its problems, and to prepare current and future generations to limit the magnitude of climate change and to respond to its challenges (Beatty, 2012). Specifically, CCE needs to help learners develop knowledge, skills and values and action to engage and learn about the causes, impact and management of climate change Chang, C. H. (2014). Climate change education: Knowing, doing and being. Rutledge.(Chang, 2014). * Science Education (SE) focuses primarily on teaching knowledge and skills, to develop innovative thought in society (Wals et al., 2014). * Outdoor Education (OE) relies on the assumption that learning experiences outdoors in ‚Äònature‚Äô foster an appreciation of nature, resulting in pro-environmental awareness and action (Clarke & Mcphie,2014). Outdoor education means learning \\"in\\" and \\"for\\" the outdoors. * Experiential education (ExE) is a process through which a learner constructs knowledge, skill, and value from direct experiences\\" (AEE, 2002, p. 5) Experiential education can be viewed as both a process and method to deliver the ideas and skills associated with environmental education (ERIC, 2002). * Garden-based learning (GBL) is an instructional strategy that utilizes the garden as a teaching tool. It encompasses programs, activities and projects in which the garden is the foundation for integrated learning, in and across disciplines, through active, engaging, real-world experiences that have personal meaning for children, youth, adults and communities in an informal outside learning setting. * Inquiry-based Science (IBS) is an active open style of teaching in which students follow scientific steps in a similar manner as scientists to study some problem (Walker 2015). Often used in biological and environmental settings. While each of these educational fields has their own objectives, there are points where they overlap with the intentions and philosophy of environmental education. History The roots of environmental education can be traced back as early as the 18th century when Jean-Jacques Rousseau stressed the importance of an education that focuses on the environment in Emile: or, On Education. Several decades later, Louis Agassiz, a Swiss-born naturalist, echoed Rousseau's philosophy as he encouraged students to ‚ÄúStudy nature, not books.‚ÄùBerkeley.edu These two influential scholars helped lay the foundation for a concrete environmental education program, known as nature study, which took place in the late 19th and early 20th century. The nature study movement used fables and moral lessons to help students develop an appreciation of nature and embrace the natural world.Bill Cronon, WilliamCronon.net Anna Botsford Comstock, the head of the Department of Nature Study at Cornell University, was a prominent figure in the nature study movement. She wrote the Handbook for Nature Study in 1911 which used nature to educate children on cultural values. Comstock and the other leaders of the movement, such as Liberty Hyde Bailey, helped Nature Study garner tremendous amounts of support from community leaders, teachers, and scientists to change the science curriculum for children across the United States. A new type of environmental education, Conservation Education, emerged as a result of the Great Depression and Dust Bowl during the 1920s and 1930s. Conservation Education dealt with the natural world in a drastically different way from Nature Study because it focused on rigorous scientific training rather than natural history. Conservation Education was a major scientific management and planning tool that helped solve social, economic, and environmental problems during this time period. The modern environmental education movement, which gained significant momentum in the late 1960s and early 1970s, stems from Nature Study and Conservation Education. During this time period, many events ‚Äì such as Civil Rights, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War ‚Äì placed Americans at odds with one another and the U.S. government. However, as more people began to fear the fallout from radiation, the chemical pesticides mentioned in Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, and the significant amounts of air pollution and waste, the public's concern for their health and the health of their natural environment led to a unifying phenomenon known as environmentalism. Environmental education was born of the realization that solving complex local and global problems cannot be accomplished by politicians and experts alone, but requires \\"the support and active participation of an informed public in their various roles as consumers, voters, employers, and business and community leaders.\\" Canadian Environmental Grantmakers Network. 2006. \\"Environmental Education in Canada: An overview for grantmakers,\\" Toronto: ON. http://www.cegn.org/english/home/documents/EEBrief_Eng.pdf , p. 2 One of the first articles about environmental education as a new movement appeared in the Phi Delta Kappan in 1969, authored by James A. Swan. A definition of \\"Environmental Education\\" first appeared in The Journal of Environmental Education in 1969, written by William B. Stapp. Stapp later went on to become the first Director of Environmental Education for UNESCO, and then the Global Rivers International Network. Ultimately, the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970 ‚Äì a national teach-in about environmental problems ‚Äì paved the way for the modern environmental education movement. Later that same year, President Nixon passed the National Environmental Education Act, which was intended to incorporate environmental education into K-12 schools.EElink.net Then, in 1971, the National Association for Environmental Education (now known as the North American Association for Environmental Education) was created to improve environmental literacy by providing resources to teachers and promoting environmental education programs. Internationally, environmental education gained recognition when the UN Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1972, declared environmental education must be used as a tool to address global environmental problems. The United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) created three major declarations that have guided the course of environmental education. In 2002, the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development 2005-2014 (UNDESD) was formed as a way to reconsider, excite, and change approaches to acting positively on global challenges. The Commission on Education and Communication (CEC) helped support the work of the UNDESD by composing a backbone structure for education for sustainability, which contained five major components. The components are \\"Imagining a better future\\", \\"Critical thinking and reflection\\", \\"Participation in decision making\\" and \\"Partnerships, and Systemic thinking\\". On June 9‚Äì14, 2013, the seventh World Environmental Education Congress was held in Marrakesh, Morocco. The overall theme of the conference was \\"Environmental education and issues in cities and rural areas: seeking greater harmony‚Äù, and incorporated 11 different areas of concern. The World Environmental Education Congress had 2,400 members, representing over 150 countries. This meeting was the first time ever that it had been held in an Arab country, and was put together by two different organizations, the Mohamed VI Foundation for Environmental Protection and the World Environmental Education Congress Permanent Secretariat in Italy. Topics addressed at the congress include stressing the importance of environmental education and its role to empower, establishing partnerships to promote environmental education, how to mainstream environmental and sustainability, and even how to make universities \\"greener\\". =Stockholm Declaration= June 5‚Äì16, 1972 - The Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. The document was made up of 7 proclamations and 26 principles \\"to inspire and guide the peoples of the world in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment.\\" =Belgrade Charter= October 13‚Äì22, 1975 - The Belgrade CharterThe Belgrade Charter, Adopted by the UNESCO-UNEP International Environmental Workshop, October 13‚Äì22, 1975. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000177/017772eb.pdf accessed 3 March 2011 was the outcome of the International Workshop on Environmental Education held in Belgrade, Jugoslavia (now Serbia). The Belgrade Charter was built upon the Stockholm Declaration and adds goals, objectives, and guiding principles of environmental education programs. It defines an audience for environmental education, which includes the general public. =Tbilisi Declaration= October 14‚Äì26, 1977 - The Tbilisi Declaration \\"noted the unanimous accord in the important role of environmental education in the preservation and improvement of the world's environment, as well as in the sound and balanced development of the world's communities.\\" The Tbilisi Declaration updated and clarified The Stockholm Declaration and The Belgrade Charter by including new goals, objectives, characteristics, and guiding principles of environmental education. Later that decade, in 1977, the Intergovernmental Conference on Environmental Education in Tbilisi, Georgian SSR, Soviet Union emphasized the role of Environmental Education in preserving and improving the global environment and sought to provide the framework and guidelines for environmental education. The Conference laid out the role, objectives, and characteristics of environmental education, and provided several goals and principles for environmental education. About Environmental education has been considered an additional or elective subject in much of traditional K-12 curriculum. At the elementary school level, environmental education can take the form of science enrichment curriculum, natural history field trips, community service projects, and participation in outdoor science schools. EE policies assist schools and organizations in developing and improving environmental education programs that provide citizens with an in-depth understanding of the environment. School related EE policies focus on three main components: curricula, green facilities, and training. Schools can integrate environmental education into their curricula with sufficient funding from EE policies. This approach ‚Äì known as using the ‚Äúenvironment as an integrating context‚Äù for learning ‚Äì uses the local environment as a framework for teaching state and district education standards. In addition to funding environmental curricula in the classroom, environmental education policies allot the financial resources for hands-on, outdoor learning. These activities and lessons help address and mitigate \\"nature deficit disorder\\", as well as encourage healthier lifestyles. Green schools, or green facility promotion, are another main component of environmental education policies. Greening school facilities cost, on average, a little less than 2 percent more than creating a traditional school, but payback from these energy efficient buildings occur within only a few years. Environmental education policies help reduce the relatively small burden of the initial start-up costs for green schools. Green school policies also provide grants for modernization, renovation, or repair of older school facilities. Additionally, healthy food options are also a central aspect of green schools. These policies specifically focus on bringing freshly prepared food, made from high-quality, locally grown ingredients into schools. In secondary school, environmental curriculum can be a focused subject within the sciences or is a part of student interest groups or clubs. At the undergraduate and graduate level, it can be considered its own field within education, environmental studies, environmental science and policy, ecology, or human/cultural ecology programs. Environmental education is not restricted to in-class lesson plans. Children can learn about the environment in many ways. Experiential lessons in the school yard, field trips to national parks, after-school green clubs, and school-wide sustainability projects help make the environment an easily accessible topic. Furthermore, celebration of Earth Day or participation in EE week (run through the National Environmental Education Foundation) can help further environmental education. Effective programs promote a holistic approach and lead by example, using sustainable practices in the school to encourage students and parents to bring environmental education into their home. The final aspect of environmental education policies involves training individuals to thrive in a sustainable society. In addition to building a strong relationship with nature, citizens must have the skills and knowledge to succeed in a 21st-century workforce. Thus, environmental education policies fund both teacher training and worker training initiatives. Teachers train to effectively teach and incorporate environmental studies. On the other hand, the current workforce must be trained or re-trained so they can adapt to the new green economy. Environmental education policies that fund training programs are critical to educating citizens to prosper in a sustainable society.  In the United States  Following the 1970s, non-governmental organizations that focused on environmental education continued to form and grow, the number of teachers implementing environmental education in their classrooms increased, and the movement gained stronger political backing. A critical move forward came when the United States Congress passed the National Environmental Education Act of 1990, which placed the Office of Environmental Education in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and allowed the EPA to create environmental education initiatives at the federal level. The EPA has their own definition of what environmental education should be and it is as follows. \\"Environmental education is a process that allows individuals to explore environmental issues, engage in problem solving, and take action to improve the environment. As a result, individuals develop a deeper understanding of environmental issues and have the skills to make informed and responsible decisions.\\" The EPA also has a list of the components of what should be gained from EE. * Awareness and sensitivity to the environment and environmental challenges * Knowledge and understanding of the environment and environmental challenges * Attitudes of concern for the environment and motivation to improve or maintain environmental quality * Skills to identify and help resolve environmental challenges * Participation in activities that lead to the resolution of environmental challenges Through the EPA Environmental Education (EE) Grant Program, public schools, communities agencies, and NGO's are eligible to receive federal funding for local educational projects that reflect the EPA's priorities: air quality, water quality, chemical safety, and public participation among the communities. In the United States some of the antecedents of environmental education were the Nature Study movement, conservation education and school camping. Nature studies integrated academic approach with outdoor exploration (Roth, 1978). Conservation education raised awareness about the misuse of natural resources and the need for their preservation. George Perkins Marsh discoursed on humanity's integral part of the natural world. Governmental agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and the EPA supported conservation efforts. Conservation ideals still guide environmental education today. School camping was exposure to the environment and use of resources outside of the classroom for educational purposes. The legacies of these antecedents are still present in the evolving arena of environmental education.  Obstacles  A study of Ontario teachers explored obstacles to environmental education. Through an internet-based survey questionnaire, 300 K-12 teachers from Ontario, Canada responded. Based on the results of the survey, the most significant challenges identified by the sample of Ontario teachers include over-crowded curriculum, lack of resources, low priority of environmental education in schools, limited access to the outdoors, student apathy to environmental issues, and the controversial nature of sociopolitical action. An influential article by Stevenson (1987/2007) outlines conflicting goals of environmental education and traditional schooling.{{cite journallast1=Stevensonfirst1=R. B.year=2007title=Schooling and environmental education: Contradictions in purpose and practiceurl=journal=Environmental Education Researchvolume=13issue=2pages=139‚Äì153doi=10.1080/13504620701295726} Originally published in Robottom, I. (Ed.) Environmental education: Practice and possibility. Geelong, Victoria: Deakin University Press, pp. 69-82. } According to Stevenson (1987/2007), the recent critical and action orientation of environmental education creates a challenging task for schools. Contemporary environmental education strives to transform values that underlie decision making from ones that aid environmental (and human) degradation to those that support a sustainable planet.Tanner, R.T. 1974. \\"Ecology, environment and education,\\" Lincoln, NE, Professional Educators Publications This contrasts with the traditional purpose of schools of conserving the existing social order by reproducing the norms and values that currently dominate environmental decision making. Confronting this contradiction is a major challenge to environmental education teachers. Additionally, the dominant narrative that all environmental educators have an agenda can present difficulties in expanding reach. It is said that an environmental educator is one \\"who uses information and educational processes to help people analyze the merits of the many and varied points of view usually present on a given environmental issues.\\"Hug, J. (1977). Two hats. In H. R. Hungerford, W. J. Bluhm, T. L. Volk, & J. M. Ramsey (Eds.), Essential Readings in Environmental Education (pp. 47). Champaign, IL: Stipes Publishing Greater efforts must be taken to train educators on the importance of staying within the profession's substantive structure, and in informing the general public on the profession's intention to empower fully informed decision making. Another obstacle facing the implementation of environmental education lies the quality of education itself. Charles Sayan, the executive director of the Ocean Conservation Society, represents alternate views and critiques on environmental education in his new book The Failure of Environmental Education (And How We Can Fix It). In a Yale Environment 360 interview, Sayan discusses his book and outlines several flaws within environmental education, particularly its failed efforts to ‚Äúreach its potential in fighting climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation‚Äù. He believes that environmental education is not ‚Äúkeeping pace with environmental degradation‚Äù and encourages structural reform by increasing student engagement as well as improving relevance of information. These same critiques are discussed in Stewart Hudson's BioScience paper, ‚ÄúChallenges for Environmental Education: Issues and Ideas for the 21st Century‚Äù. In 2017, a study found that high school science textbooks and government resources on climate change from USA, EU, Canada and Australia did focus their recommendations for CO2 emission reductions on lower-impact actions instead of promoting the most effective emission-reduction strategies. Movement A movement that has progressed since the relatively recent founding of environmental education in industrial societies has transported the participant from nature appreciation and awareness to education for an ecologically sustainable future. This trend may be viewed as a microcosm of how many environmental education programs seek to first engage participants through developing a sense of nature appreciation which then translates into actions that affect conservation and sustainability. Programs range from New York to California, including Life Lab at University of California, Santa Cruz, as well as Cornell University in  Environmental Education in the Global South  Environmentalism has also began to make waves in the development of the global South, as the ‚ÄúFirst World‚Äù takes on the responsibility of helping developing countries to combat environmental issues produced and prolonged by conditions of poverty. Unique to environmental education in the Global South is its particular focus on sustainable development. This goal has been a part of international agenda since the 1900s, with the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organizations (UNESCO) and the Earth Council Alliance (ECA) at the forefront of pursuing sustainable development in the south. The 1977 Tbilisi intergovernmental conference played a key role in the development of outcome of the conference was the Tbilisi Declaration, a unanimous accord which ‚Äúconstitutes the framework, principles, and guidelines for environmental education at all levels‚Äîlocal, national, regional, and international‚Äîand for all age groups both inside and outside the formal school system‚Äù recommended as a criterion for implementing environmental education. The Declaration was established with the intention of increasing environmental stewardship, awareness and behavior, which paved the way for the rise of modern environmental education. After the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, over 80 National Councils for Sustainable Development in developing countries were created between 1992‚Äì1998 to aid in compliance of international sustainability goals and encourage ‚Äúcreative solutions‚Äù. In 1993, the Earth Council Alliance released the Treaty on environmental education for sustainable societies and global responsibility, sparking discourse on environmental education. The Treaty, in 65 statements, outlines the role of environmental education in facilitating sustainable development through all aspects of democratized participation and provides a methodology for the Treaty's signatories. It has been instrumentally utilized in expanding the field towards the global South, wherein the discourse of ‚Äúenvironmental education for sustainable development‚Äù recognizes a need to include human population dynamics in EE and emphasizes ‚Äúaspects related to contemporary economic realities and by placing greater emphasis on concerns for planetary solidarity‚Äù. Even as a necessary tool for the proliferation of environmental stewardship, environmental education implemented in the South varies and addresses environmental issues in relation to their impact different communities and specific community needs. Whereas in the developed global North where the environmentalist sentiments are centered around conservation without taking into consideration ‚Äúthe needs of people living within communities‚Äù, the global South must push forth a conservation agenda that parallels with social, economic, and political development. The role of environmental education in the South is centered around potential economic growth in development projects, as explicitly stated by the UNESCO, to apply environmental education for sustainable development through a \\"creative and effective use of human potential and all forms of capital to ensure rapid and more equitable economic growth, with minimal impact on the environment\\". Moving into the 21st century, EE was furthered by United Nations as a part of the 2000 Millennium Development Goals to improve the planet by 2015. The MDGs included global efforts to end extreme poverty, work towards gender equality, access to education, and sustainable development to name a few. Although the MDGs produced great outcomes, its objectives were not met, and MDGs were soon were soon replaced by Sustainable Development Goals. A ‚Äúuniversal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity‚Äù, SDGs became the new face of global priorities. These new goals incorporated objectives from MDGs yet incorporated a necessary environmental framework to ‚Äúaddress key systemic barriers to sustainable development such as inequality, unsustainable consumption patterns, weak institutional capacity and environmental degradation that the MDGs neglected‚Äù. Trends One of the current trends within environmental education seeks to move from an approach of ideology and activism to one that allows students to make informed decisions and take action based on experience as well as data. Within this process, environmental curricula have progressively been integrated into governmental education standards. Some environmental educators find this movement distressing and move away from the original political and activist approach to environmental education while others find this approach more valid and accessible. Regardless, many educational institutions are encouraging students to take an active role in environmental education and stewardship at their institutions. They know that \\"to be successful, greening initiatives require both grassroots support from the student body and top down support from high-level campus administrators.\\" Italy announced in 2019 that environmental education (including topics of sustainability and climate change) will be integrated into other subject matter and will be a mandatory part of the curriculum in public schools. In the United States, Title IV, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (\\"ESSA,\\" 2015) states that environmental education is eligible for grant funding. The program gives a ‚Äúwell-rounded‚Äù education as well as access to student health and safety programs. Title IV, Part B states that environmental literacy programs are also eligible for funding through the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program. The funds that are available for both parts are block granted to the states using the Title I formula. In the FY2018 budget, Titles IVA and IVB were both given $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. For title IVA, this is a $700 million raise from the 2017 budget which makes the 2018‚Äì2019 school year the most availability to environmental education ever.  Renewable Energy Education  Renewable energy education (REE) is a relatively new field of education. The overall objectives of REE pertain to giving a working knowledge and understanding of concepts, facts, principles and technologies for gathering the renewable sources of energy. Based on these objectives, the role of a renewable energy education programs should be informative, investigative, educative, and imaginative. REE should be taught with the world's population in mind as the world will run out of non-renewable resources within the next century. Renewable energy education is also being brought to political leaders as a means of getting more sustainable development to occur around the globe. This is happening in the hopes that it will uproot millions of people out of poverty and into a better quality of life in many countries. Renewable energy education is also about bringing awareness of climate change to the general public as well as an understanding of the current renewable energy technologies. An understanding of the new technologies is imperative to get them stream-lined and accepted by the vast majority of the public.

Mk1 at Brickhill on Falcon Motor Clubs March Hare trial in 2004 1952 Dellow MKII - photographed in 2005 Dellow cars were made in a factory (owned by Delsons - who produced nuts and bolts) at Alvechurch, just south of Birmingham, England between 1949 and 1956. Dellow Motors Ltd was started by Ken Delingpole and Ron Lowe to produce road-going sports cars for the enthusiast to use in trials, rallies and hill-climbs. A small number of very early cars used Austin 7 chassis as per Ron Lowe's special, FUY 374. The other prototypes included OP 3835 owned by Earl \\"Mick\\" Heighway, HAB 245 (Eric Penn) CAB 282 (Lewis Tracey) and EDE 384 (Merrick). From 1950, with scrap Austin 7's in short supply, an 1172cc Ford 10 engine was utilised in an A-frame chassis with a very light tubular steel framework welded to the chassis and panelled in aluminium, early cars having no doors. The main chassis frame was made from Government-surplus chrome-molybdenum rocket tubes from WW2, these rockets being RP-3 (Rocket Projectile 3 inch) types as used by Hawker Typhoon and Bristol Beaufighter aircraft. [They were NOT \\"bazooka tubes\\" as described by Sam Lovegrove on \\"Shed and Buried\\" ... ] Brakes were standard Ford cable/rod operated drums all round. The tubular A-frame design [supposedly inspired by the pre-war BMW328 chassis] achieved light weight and had a rearward weight bias for trials. Many sporting awards were won by drivers of Dellow cars in the early 1950s, not only in trials but also in other events such as driving tests and hillclimbs. Dellows also took overall honours in the MCC organised Daily Express National Rally and the Circuit of Ireland Rally. Dellow drivers often shone in other forms of motor sport, Tony Marsh from Kinver went on to become RAC Hill Climb Champion on no less than 6 occasions. Peter Collins from Kidderminster, later drove for HWM, BRM and Vanwall, then for Ferrari. Dellow styling was created by Lionel Evans at his Radpanels coachbuilding business in Kidderminster. The car evolved through several variants known as Mk I to Mk V. Early cars had the Ford beam front axle with a transverse leaf spring and short Panhard rod, quarter elliptics at the rear and Andre Hartford friction dampers all round. The Ford torque-tube was suitably shortened and the vast majority of cars used the 3-speed Ford gearbox but a very small number of cars (KOX 300 being an example) were produced to customer order with a 4-speed gearbox, from the 10M series Morris. The use of a 4-speed Morris box was pioneered by the \\"Lightweight\\" of Tony Marsh. Wheels were 5-stud from Ford and could be 16\\" diameter from the Prefect (narrow rim), 16\\" from the van (wider rim), 17\\" from the Popular, 18\\" also from the van. Later owners often fitted Ballamy 15\\" wheels in order to use more modern radial tyres. Dellows usually carried twin spare wheels. Some rolling Dellow chassis were sold to individuals who wished to build their own body [which were rarely as good looking as the factory cars ...]. One or two 'Replicas' have been built since the factory closed ... The Ford E93A engines were mildly tuned and many used twin SU's on a cast alloy 'Dellow' manifold. However, as an option the factory also offered the car with a Wade-Ventor (Roots type) supercharger installation. The MkII saw the introduction of a new and much more robust rear chassis section with coil springs, separate telescopic shock absorbers and a Panhard rod. This stiffer chassis allowed doors to become an optional fitting. The Mk V version was derived from the \\"Lightweight\\" Dellow (WRF 81) constructed by Tony Marsh for speed events in 1954. It saw coil springs introduced at the front (over telescopic dampers) although still with a one- piece Ford beam axle. About 300 Dellows in total are believed to have been constructed at Alvechurch. Complete cars were available from selected dealers across the country and a now-rare sales leaflet was accordingly produced. One Dellow owner even towed a caravan for family holidays and a firm of agricultural engineers bought several Dellows for their reps to drive. A new company, Dellow Engineering, based in Oldbury near Birmingham produced a Mk VI. It is often incorrectly quoted as having a glass fibre body, but it too was in fact built with alloy panelling. Very few Mk VI's were made. Cars * Dellow Prototypes-1947 - Ford 10 powered Austin 7 chassis. * Dellow Mk I - 1949 - Ford 10 powered basic 2 seater (no doors). * Dellow Mk II - 1951 - Rear coil springs, telescopic dampers,(optional doors). * Dellow Mk III - 1952 - 2+2 model. * Dellow Mk IV - 1954? - 2+2 one-off with Ford Consul engine. * Dellow Mk V - 1954 - Coil sprung beam front axle, tuned engine, Mk Vs generally still only had the 3 speed Ford box although the \\"Lightweight\\" WRF 81, now owned by Nigel Brown, had a 4 speed ex-Morris unit.(information from David Haley of the Dellow Register.) * Dellow Mk VI - 1957 - Independent front suspension, ladder chassis.

History El Seibo is one of the oldest towns in the country, it was created by the Constitution of November 6, 1844 although it already existed as a territorial division since colonial times, for this reason its foundation dates back to 1502 by the Spanish conqueror Juan de Esquivel. The name of Seibo comes from a tribal chief of Taino race. The name of Santa Cruz de El Seibo, is taken from the Spanish custom of placing the Cruz de Cristo in the cardinal points, as protection against evils. A cross called Asomante is still preserved, in the West Sector of the city of El Seibo. Notable residents Some of the distinguished people from El Seibo include Manuela Diez, mother of Juan Pablo Duarte, Ces√°reo Guillermo and Alexander Woss y Gil, who were Presidents of the Republic. In addition, Monsignor Octavio A. Beras, Archbishop of Santo Domingo and Cardinal of the Catholic Church and Minerva Bernardino, who represented the country in several international events and defended women's rights, were also from Santa Cruz del Seibo, as well as world-renowned and respected tenor, Francisco (Chahin) Casanova. Also famed baseball player Cesar Jeronimo (Jr). Famous psychiatrist and public personality: Dr. M√°ximo Beras Goico; TV personality, actor and comedian: Freddy Beras Goico, and pop singer and TV personality Charyt√≠n. Attractions El Seibo, which venerates Saint Cruz with great fervor, have celebrations to honour this saint from 1 May to 10 May. It is the only city in the country that in its supervisory celebrations organizes bullfights. Another attraction of the supervisory celebrations is the popular vigil of \\"atabales\\", a type of popular percussive music. These celebrations enjoy great popularity in all sectors of the community. Climate References * Source: S√≠ntesis de Ciudades, Pueblos e Islas del Pa√≠s.

He served for nearly thirty years as director of the K√∂niglich Zoologisches und Anthropologisch-Ethnographisches Museum (now the natural history museum or Museum f√ºr Tierkunde Dresden) in Dresden. He worked on comparative anatomy and appreciated the ideas of evolution, and influenced many German scientists by translating into German the 1858 papers by Darwin and Wallace which first proposed evolution by natural selection. Influenced by the writings of Wallace with whom he interacted, he travelled to Southeast Asia, and collected specimens and recorded his observations from the region. Biography Meyer was born in a wealthy Jewish family in Hamburg and was educated at the universities of G√∂ttingen, Vienna, Z√ºrich and Berlin. He became director of the Anthropological and Ethnographic Museum in Dresden in 1874 and continued in that position until his retirement in 1905. He studied medicine in Zurich and published a thesis on electrical stimulation of the nerves. In 1870 he translated the works of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace into German. Enamoured by Wallace's travelogues, he travelled in the East Indies at the end of the nineteenth century. He collected numerous specimens. Meyer's East Indies bird collection and beetles and butterflies collected in Celebes and New Guinea are in Staatliches Museum f√ºr Tierkunde Dresden. The museum was destroyed during the Allied bombing of Dresden, 13‚Äì15 February 1945, and many specimens were lost. In 1874 he succeeded Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach as director at the same museum. Among his inventions were the \\"Dresden Case\\" made of iron and glass that he designed to store specimens. It is believed that he held the post until 1904 when anti- semitism led to his suspension. He retired in 1906. He also studied amphibians and reptiles, describing several new species of lizards endemic to New Guinea. In addition to birds he made a study on primates. He described Tarsius sangirensis, the Sangihe tarsier, a small primate that he found in Indonesia in 1897. His knowledge of English allowed him to collaborate with many researchers such as L. W. Wiglesworth with whom he wrote The Birds of Celebes and the Neighbouring Islands (1898). His two volume studies on the skeletons of birds was dedicated to Professors Max F√ºrbringer and Henri Milne-Edwards. The brown sicklebill (Epimachus meyeri ) was named after him when the species was first recorded in 1884. He published a classification of birds and named and described several new species, among them Queen Carola's parotia (Parotia carolae), Princess Stephanie's astrapia (Astrapia stephaniae), the red-capped flowerpecker (Dicaeum geelvinkianum), and the takahƒì (Notornis hochstetteri, now Porphyrio hochstetteri ). Meyer is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, Typhlosaurus meyeri.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

Mission Since January 1994, the 23d Flying Training Squadron is the United States Air Force's primary source of helicopter pilots for special operations, combat search and rescue, missile support, and distinguished visitor airlift missions. Its mission is providing Air Force helicopter flight training for all undergraduate pilots proceeding to flying careers in the Air Force's UH-1N Huey, HH-60G Pave Hawk or CV-22 Osprey fleets. Tactical training includes alternate insertion and extraction (AIEs) but specialized training like hoists and gunnery is saved for type- qualification in post-graduate flight training at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico to smooth their transition in more complicated aircraft and missions. USAF rotary wing students receive their wings when their Fort Rucker pilot training class is completed. History =World War II= Antisubmarine operations in the Caribbean The 23d's first predecessor is the 76th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) which was activated at Salt Lake City Army Air Base, Utah on 15 January 1941. It was redesignated the 23d Antisubmarine Squadron (Heavy) on 3 March 1943, and assigned to the 26th Antisubmarine Wing and moved to Imeson Field, Jacksonville, Florida with a variety of aircraft (North American B-25 Mitchell, Douglas O-43 and a Douglas B-18 Bolo). Coastal patrols were flown over the southeast coast looking for German U-Boats. It deployed to Batista Field, Cuba on 28 February 1943, where it conducted antisubmarine operations until 24 April, then moved to Edinburgh Field, Trinidad on 5 August 1943 and was attached to Antilles Air Command. From Trinidad, was moved to Zandrey Field, Surinam between 15 August 1943 and December. The unit also had elements at NAS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and rotated its crews to and from Florida to its far-flung operating elements about every 10 weeks. One flight of the squadron was temporarily stationed at Caracas Airport, Venezuela. With the Navy taking over the antisubmarine mission in mid-1943, the squadron returned to the United States via Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico, where unit personnel were reassigned to other units. It was disbanded on 6 February 1944. Troop carrier operations in Europe The second predecessor of the unit was activated as the 23d Troop Carrier Squadron on 21 November 1944 at Pope Field, North Carolina and equipped with Douglas C-47 Skytrains. Assigned to the 349th Troop Carrier Group of IX Troop Carrier Command in England, at RAF Barkston Heath, the unit transported cargo and personnel throughout the European Theater of Operation. Later operated from Advanced Landing Grounds in France, primarily resupply and casualty evacuation airfields, many times unsurfaced close to the front lines. Was upgraded to the Curtiss C-46 Commando in early 1945. Inactivated on 7 September 1946 after serving with the United States Air Forces in Europe as an intra-theater transport squadron supporting the occupation forces in Germany. =Helicopter airlift= The activation of the 23d Helicopter Squadron on 9 July 1956, was the result of the inactivation of the 516th Troop Carrier Group (Assault, Rotary Wing). The 516th had been a victim of an Air Force and Army dispute over control of assault helicopters. The squadron was activated at Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee, and assigned to Eighteenth Air Force. The squadron was formed by absorbing the personnel, aircraft, and equipment of the 345th Troop Carrier Squadron (Assault, Rotary Wing). The squadron moved to Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base France, the squadron arrived at the new base between 7 and 15 November 1956, equipped with Piasecki H-21 helicopters. Built for a tactical fighter wing, Phalsbourg had plenty of hangar space and quarters for the 23d Squadron. It could keep all its H-21Bs indoors. The 23d Helicopter Squadron provided useful general airlift support throughout France. Standard helicopter missions included: Special Airlift Missions, Administrative Support Mission, and Emergency Air Evacuation Missions. It transferred injured U.S. personnel and dependents that required major medical attention to full-service hospitals from remote military sites across Europe. It was assigned to the 322d Air Division at √âvreux-Fauville Air Base, France for operational control, mission scheduling, and airlift priorities. The 322d recommended that the 23d Helicopter Squadron be divided into four detachments for greater utilization. * Detachments #1 and #4 remained at Phalsbourg with ten aircraft. Major maintenance was performed by teams dispatched from Phalsbourg, and all H-21B-peculiar spare parts were stocked at Phalsbourg. * Detachment #2 flew four H-21s to RAF Wethersfield, England. These four H-21Bs were equipped with air-sea hoist provisions for rescue flights. * Detachment #3 relocated four H-21s to Wheelus Air Base, Libya in December 1956 to support gunnery range operations at El Uotia and Tarhuna, and to assist the Martin TM-61 Matador missile launches and flight test programs. After a year of operation, USAFE felt the limitations of helicopter airlift were not worth the costs, and decided to eliminate the 23d Helicopter Squadron from its force structure after fourteen months in Europe. Also during this same time, the United States Army in France was obtaining similar helicopter airlift capabilities, and the mission of the 23d could be transferred to USAREUR. The squadron was inactivated on 8 January 1958. However, the Detachment at Wheelus was so successful that after the 23d departed France, six of their H-21Bs continued to operate, as part of the 7272d Flying Training Wing. During 1960 the Wheelus helicopters participated in an ongoing long distance rescue mission when they evacuated American and European civilians from the Republic of the Congo (L√©opoldville), where they were being threatened by rioting native troops. =Vietnam War= U.S. Air Force 0-1E Bird Dog aircraft (USAF Photo). The final predecessor of the squadron was organized on 15 April 1966 as the 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, and operated from Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, from 15 April 1966 ‚Äì 22 September 1975. The 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron was created out of the personnel and equipment of Detachment 3 of the 505th Tactical Control Group Lt. Col. (selectee) Robert L. Johnston. Lt. Col Johnston selected Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base for operations in the Steel Tiger portion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail between Nape Pass and Tchepone in the Laos Panhandle.Officially, the squadron was headquartered at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, but only personnel and pay records were handled there. It was the first USAF combat squadron to be stationed at Nakhon Phanom to operate across the Mekong River over Laos. Its operations would be countered by a North Vietnamese increase in number, type, and caliber of antiaircraft weaponry. By 1972, the Ho Chi Minh Trail would be defended by guns ranging from heavy machine guns to 100mm cannon, and both truck-borne and man-portable surface to air missiles.http://www.squawk-flash.org/23d_tass/23d_tass.htm Churchill, p. 70 Five Forward Air Controller (FAC)s went to Nakhon Phanom in January to test the idea of working the Steel Tiger portion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and many more came there on temporary duty during the following months. Losses of 23d pilots started in March with Capt. Karl Edward Worst, whose plane disappeared 2 March 1966 in an apparent mid-air collision with a Republic F-105 Thunderchief during an air strike. The unit and mission were initially called Operation Cricket, which name the area airborne control ship took for a call sign, and the original pilot call sign was \\"Gumbey\\". This was changed to \\"Nail\\" in mid-1966, and \\"Nail\\" remained a call sign until war's end. The 23d also used the call sign \\"Rustic\\". The 23d's well-known unit patch featuring Jiminy Cricket with a walkie-talkie and an umbrella was sold to the squadron by Walt Disney for $1 in response to a request from Nail pilot John Taylor. OV-10 Bronco aircraft firing a white phosphorus smoke rocket The 23d, like its sister FAC squadrons based in Vietnam, initially flew Cessna O-1 Bird Dogs in 1966 and into 1968, when the last one was retired. All of its O-1's were the F variant, which featured a variable-pitch propeller. In 1967, the unit began receiving Cessna O-2 Skymasters to replace the O-1s. In 1969, the squadron began to receive North American OV-10 Broncos, and flew that aircraft until the end of the war. Over the course of the war, the 23d lost 7 O-1s, 15 O-2s, and 23 OV-10s.Hobson 2001, p. 253. The 23d lost at least 27 pilots during the war, and its pilots received many Air Force combat decorations.FAC Memorials - \\"All Gave Some, But Some Gave All\\" Among those decorations is the Air Force Cross awarded to Capt. Philip V. Maywald for extraordinary heroism during a rescue mission over Laos on 21 May 1968. The text of his citation reads: The President of the United States of America, authorized by Title 10, Section 8742, United States Code, takes pleasure in presenting the Air Force Cross to Captain Philip V. Maywald (AFSN: 0-70153), United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force while serving as an O-2A Pilot with the 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron, 56th Air Commando Wing, in action in Southeast Asia on 21 May 1968. On that date, Captain Maywald braved an intense and deadly barrage of hostile gunfire for over two hours while he controlled the successful rescue of a fellow pilot who had been downed by anti-aircraft fire deep within hostile territory. Despite the great personal risk involved to his own life, Captain Maywald, with undaunted determination, indomitable courage, and professional skill, repeatedly made low passes over the rescue scene in his light unarmored observation aircraft. At times, he flew within fifty feet of the hostile forces to determine their positions and to deliberately draw their fire on his aircraft. Due to his courage, persistence, and professional skill the downed pilot was safely recovered. Through his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness, Captain Maywald reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=3614 On 12 April 1975 the 23d supported Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of Phnom Penh, Cambodia.Dunham, p. 122 The 23d was inactivated on 22 September 1975. =Reactivation in the US= OA-10 Thunderbolt of the 23d TASS, Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, AZ (USAF photo). The squadron was reactivated on 30 November 1975 at as part of the 602d Tactical Air Control Wing at Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas, where it trained OV-10 forward air controllers before moving to Davis- Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona on 1 July 1980. The 27th Tactical Air Support Squadron, an O-2A sister squadron, was at Davis-Monthan. The 27th was inactivated and the 23d assumed its mission, personnel and equipment, until it was again inactivated on 1 November 1991.Richard Barrett, Lt Col, USAF Retired, assigned to 27th and 23rd TASS November 1977 to February 1983 The 23d operated 26 Cessna OA-37 Dragonflys. In September 1985, as part of a program to merge Air Force units formed after World War II with units that had seen service during the war, the 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron was consolidated with its three predecessor units. =Helicopter pilot training= The squadron was redesignated the 23d Flying Training Flight on 22 December 1993, it was reactivated on 15 January 1994 at Fort Rucker, Alabama as part of the 542d Operations Group at Kirtland Air Force Base, which conducted USAF helicopter training. Reassigned to the 58th Operations Group on 1 April 1994, it was redesignated as the 23d Flying Training Squadron on 21 December 1999. At Fort Rucker, it is housed in three geographically-separated facilities and a simulator facility off-base, the 23d handles academic, simulator, and flight line training. The Beechcraft C-12 Huron was added to the 23d's aircraft inventory in 2000. In addition to the helicopter pilot training, the 23d, with Detachment 5, Air Mobility Command Air Operations Squadron, oversees the formal training for the Air Force's C-12 C/D Super King Air 200. Detachment 5 conducts all USAF C-12 flight evaluations, and also assists HQ DIA/Air Operations in worldwide flight evaluations upon request. Detachment 5, in association with HQ Air Mobility Command develops, publishes, and implements curriculum for several courses, including academics, simulator training, flight training for Air Force C-12 initial qualification and initial instructor qualification. = Operations and Decorations= * Combat Operations.

They were initially classified as Class AM10 units before the introduction of the TOPS classification system. Constructed at BR's Derby Carriage and Wagon Works. They consisted of four carriages - a second class driving trailer, a second class trailer, a second class motor car (with guard's/luggage compartment above which the Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph was mounted) and a composite (1st and 2nd class) driving trailer. The maximum speed was 75 miles per hour. A glass partition behind the driver's cab enabled passengers in the leading and rear coaches to . History They introduced some new features; the first standard multiple units with disc brakes (emergency stop from top speed in 33 seconds over ); the first naturally air-cooled rectifiers (silicon diodes on cups of beryllium oxide), inductors and transformers. Noise was reduced by sprayed asbestos on the floor, body and roof. Original livery was overall Rail Blue, later amended to the standard BR blue and grey colour scheme. Initially they were primarily used on local services from London Euston to Bletchley, Milton Keynes, Northampton and Birmingham New Street, and within the West Midlands. They were also the first EMUs to be based on the British Rail Mark 2 bodyshell, which featured semi-integral construction. During the mid-1980s they underwent their heavy C1 refurbishment at Wolverton which included new flat windscreens, a corridor connection between the Motor Vehicle (MBS) and trailer (TSO), and a PA system among other modifications. The Class 310 has a nearly identical body shell to that of the Class 312, there are some minor detail differences in the equipment locations and the MBS has a separate guards van and storage area whereas on the 312 it is combined. The braking system is slightly different with ventilated brake discs on the axles of the B4 non-powered bogies attached to the axles whereas on the Class 312 they are mounted on the wheel discs (this permits easy replacement in the case of defects). As are the motor bogies axles on the Class 310. When first arriving on the LT&S; the Class 310 were modified with an additional plug being inserted in the dummy cylinder of each vehicle and a different size \\"choke\\" fitted in the Electro-pneumatic (EP)valve to improve the braking performance to that required on a more intensive service. Also the cast BR double arrows were removed from the cab sides on arrival, or soon after at East Ham Depot. The Class 310 stock also were used for a short while on the newly electrified route to Cambridge prior to replacement with more modern stock. The motors differed from the class 312 in that the gear ratio is lower which accounts for the maximum speed of 75 mph compared to 90 mph on the Class 312. The B4 bogies on the Class 310 are fitted with friction primary dampers whereas on the 312 they are hydraulic. The main fleet of Class 310/0 units was replaced on the Euston commuter routes with Class 317/1 units which began to enter service on the route in late 1987, however the Class 317 units were then superseded by the new build of Class 321/4 within about 2 years. Most Class 310 units that survived into the 21st century were withdrawn between 2001 and 2002. Sub-classes *310/0 - four- car units. All 310s were originally 310/0s. *310/1 - Four-car units (reduced to three-cars in the mid 1990s) modified for use in the Midlands. Accidents and incidents *18 April 1967, Unit 094 collided with a derailed mineral train between Northampton and Roade Car 76178 written off The other cars were out of service as spares. 310 094 returned to service in April 1975 with two original cars and two from other units. *5 August 1967, Unit 081 0735 Stafford to Rugby rear-end collision by runaway Trentham to Lea Hall Colliery coal train hauled by D5090 at Rugeley.

Privatisation All 310/0 units came under the control of LTS Rail (now c2c) which operated them on the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway. They were replaced by Class 357 units from 1999 to 2002. The thirteen 310/1 units came under the control of Central Trains. All were withdrawn by 2002 and replaced by a mixture of Class 170 and Class 323 units. Departmental usage DC system pictured in the New Sidings at Ramsgate - the Class 423 (4-VEP) is the second vehicle. AC system pictured near Shenfield railway station on 2 February 2004 - the train consists entirely of Class 310 vehicles In 2002, vehicles from two Class 310/1 units, numbers 310109 and 310113, were used to create a single four-car departmental unit, 960201 which could operate on either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) lines for test purposes. The set consisted of two driving cars, a Class 310 power car with Hitachi equipment and either a standard Class 310 25 kV power car or a modified 650 V third rail vehicle from a Class 423 (4-VEP) unit. One of these two vehicles was included in the formation depending upon where the unit was operating (on 25 kV overhead lines or third rail). To facilitate third rail running, shoegear was fitted to each driving car. The unit was known as the 'Hitachi Verification Train' or 'V Train' and was used by Hitachi to test and prove its traction equipment in the UK. The subsequent order for the Class 395 Javelin trains which now run on the High Speed 1 line benefitted from this exercise. The V train was scrapped at MoD Pig's Bay in Shoeburyness in 2007. Details and more pictures of the V train on AC, DC and the High Speed 1 lines can be found at Train Testing - Hitachi's V train. Preservation While there were efforts online to acquire a single unit, none of the Class 310 units were preserved.

When appointed, she was the only woman professor of theology at a Scottish University and the first woman professor of theology at New College in its 160-year history. She was born in Rosario, , and graduated with a Bachelor in Theology Degree from ISEDET, the Protestant University Institute in Buenos Aires. She completed her Ph.D at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. Her interests included liberation theology, feminist theology and queer theology. Life Althaus-Reid was born in Rosario, Argentina. She grew up in Buenos Aires, where she graduated with a BA in Theology from the Instituto Superior Evangelico de Estudios Teologicos (ISEDET) ecumenical theological institution in Buenos Aires, oriented toward liberation theology. She studied with liberation theologians including Jose Miguez Bonino and Jose Severino Croatto. She was a member of the Evangelical Methodist Church of Argentina. She followed the methods of Paulo Freire, undertaking community and social projects supported by the church in impoverished neighborhoods of Buenos Aires. Due to her experience and accomplishments in this regard, Althaus-Reid was invited to Scotland, where she worked in poor neighborhoods of Dundee and Perth, coordinating projects inspired by the liberationist pedagogy of Freire. She completed her doctorate in 1994 at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, writing her doctoral thesis on the influence of Paul Ricoeur in the methodology of liberation theology. Her academic interests included liberation theology, feminist theology and queer theology. Subsequently, she was appointed Professor of Contextual Theology at New College, University of Edinburgh. Althaus-Reid died on 20 February 2009, in Edinburgh, Scotland, where she had lived since 1986. At the time of her death she was Director of the International Association for Queer Theology, Director of the Queer Theology Project at the University of Edinburgh, and a member of the Metropolitan Community Church. In the last years of her life, she worked with the Argentine theologian Ivan Petrella to publicize liberation theology in the English-speaking world. She was also associate editor of the journal Studies in World Christianity and a member of the editorial board of the journal Concilium.  Thoughts  Althaus-Reid is perhaps most well-known for her 2002 work in Indecent Theology, in which she challenged feminists in her use of sexual and explicit language. She argued sex has been constructed by a patriarchal worldview which underpins many of the great atrocities of the world. Hence, the virginity of the Virgin Mary needs to be \\"indecented\\" as it hides the lives of many poor women who, she describes, as rarely being virgins. She also speaks about an \\"indecent Christ,\\" whereby a kenotic Christology speaks of God self-emptying and being embodied in Christ and human sexuality. She explains that \\"[Jesus] has been dressed theologically as a heterosexually oriented (celibate) man. Jesus with erased genitalia; Jesus minus erotic body.\\" Instead, she speaks about the bi- sexuality of Christ as an inclusive understanding of the incarnation. She wants to argue for a larger Christology which recasts Jesus in postmodern sexualities, genders, and economic locations. This is a critique she had against Latin American liberation theology, which she understood as failing to address questions of gender and sexuality alongside the question of conquest and colonization of the Americas.

Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred. For example, predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place. In many cases the model is chosen on the basis of detection theory to try to guess the probability of an outcome given a set amount of input data, for example given an email determining how likely that it is spam. Models can use one or more classifiers in trying to determine the probability of a set of data belonging to another set. For example, a model might be used to determine whether an email is spam or \\"ham\\" (non-spam). Depending on definitional boundaries, predictive modelling is synonymous with, or largely overlapping with, the field of machine learning, as it is more commonly referred to in academic or research and development contexts. When deployed commercially, predictive modelling is often referred to as predictive analytics. Predictive modelling is often contrasted with causal modelling/analysis. In the former, one may be entirely satisfied to make use of indicators of, or proxies for, the outcome of interest. In the latter, one seeks to determine true cause-and-effect relationships. This distinction has given rise to a burgeoning literature in the fields of research methods and statistics and to the common statement that \\"correlation does not imply causation\\". Models  Nearly any statistical model can be used for prediction purposes. Broadly speaking, there are two classes of predictive models: parametric and non-parametric. A third class, semi-parametric models, includes features of both. Parametric models make \\"specific assumptions with regard to one or more of the population parameters that characterize the underlying distribution(s)\\". Non-parametric models \\"typically involve fewer assumptions of structure and distributional form [than parametric models] but usually contain strong assumptions about independencies\\". Applications =Uplift modelling= Uplift modelling is a technique for modelling the change in probability caused by an action. Typically this is a marketing action such as an offer to buy a product, to use a product more or to re-sign a contract. For example, in a retention campaign you wish to predict the change in probability that a customer will remain a customer if they are contacted. A model of the change in probability allows the retention campaign to be targeted at those customers on whom the change in probability will be beneficial. This allows the retention programme to avoid triggering unnecessary churn or customer attrition without wasting money contacting people who would act anyway. =Archaeology= Predictive modelling in archaeology gets its foundations from Gordon Willey's mid-fifties work in the Vir√∫ Valley of Peru.Willey, Gordon R. (1953), \\"Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in the Vir√∫ Valley, Peru\\", Bulletin 155. Bureau of American Ethnology Complete, intensive surveys were performed then covariability between cultural remains and natural features such as slope and vegetation were determined. Development of quantitative methods and a greater availability of applicable data led to growth of the discipline in the 1960s and by the late 1980s, substantial progress had been made by major land managers worldwide. Generally, predictive modelling in archaeology is establishing statistically valid causal or covariable relationships between natural proxies such as soil types, elevation, slope, vegetation, proximity to water, geology, geomorphology, etc., and the presence of archaeological features. Through analysis of these quantifiable attributes from land that has undergone archaeological survey, sometimes the \\"archaeological sensitivity\\" of unsurveyed areas can be anticipated based on the natural proxies in those areas. Large land managers in the United States, such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Department of Defense (DOD),Heidelberg, Kurt, et al. \\"An Evaluation of the Archaeological Sample Survey Program at the Nevada Test and Training Range\\", SRI Technical Report 02-16, 2002Jeffrey H. Altschul, Lynne Sebastian, and Kurt Heidelberg, \\"Predictive Modeling in the Military: Similar Goals, Divergent Paths\\", Preservation Research Series 1, SRI Foundation, 2004 and numerous highway and parks agencies, have successfully employed this strategy. By using predictive modelling in their cultural resource management plans, they are capable of making more informed decisions when planning for activities that have the potential to require ground disturbance and subsequently affect archaeological sites. =Customer relationship management= Predictive modelling is used extensively in analytical customer relationship management and data mining to produce customer-level models that describe the likelihood that a customer will take a particular action. The actions are usually sales, marketing and customer retention related. For example, a large consumer organization such as a mobile telecommunications operator will have a set of predictive models for product cross-sell, product deep-sell (or upselling) and churn. It is also now more common for such an organization to have a model of savability using an uplift model. This predicts the likelihood that a customer can be saved at the end of a contract period (the change in churn probability) as opposed to the standard churn prediction model. =Auto insurance= Predictive modelling is utilised in vehicle insurance to assign risk of incidents to policy holders from information obtained from policy holders. This is extensively employed in usage-based insurance solutions where predictive models utilise telemetry- based data to build a model of predictive risk for claim likelihood. Black-box auto insurance predictive models utilise GPS or accelerometer sensor input only. Some models include a wide range of predictive input beyond basic telemetry including advanced driving behaviour, independent crash records, road history, and user profiles to provide improved risk models. =Health care= In 2009 Parkland Health & Hospital System began analyzing electronic medical records in order to use predictive modeling to help identify patients at high risk of readmission. Initially the hospital focused on patients with congestive heart failure, but the program has expanded to include patients with diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia. In 2018, Banerjee et al. proposed a deep learning model‚ÄîProbabilistic Prognostic Estimates of Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients (PPES-Met)‚Äîfor estimating short-term life expectancy (>3 months) of the patients by analyzing free-text clinical notes in the electronic medical record, while maintaining the temporal visit sequence. The model was trained on a large dataset (10,293 patients) and validated on a separated dataset (1818 patients). It achieved an area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve of 0.89. To provide explain- ability, they developed an interactive graphical tool that may improve physician understanding of the basis for the model's predictions. The high accuracy and explain-ability of the PPES-Met model may enable the model to be used as a decision support tool to personalize metastatic cancer treatment and provide valuable assistance to the physicians. = Algorithmic trading = Predictive modeling in trading is a modeling process wherein the probability of an outcome is predicted using a set of predictor variables. Predictive models can be built for different assets like stocks, futures, currencies, commodities etc. Predictive modeling is still extensively used by trading firms to devise strategies and trade. It utilizes mathematically advanced software to evaluate indicators on price, volume, open interest and other historical data, to discover repeatable patterns. =Notable failures of predictive modeling= Although not widely discussed by the mainstream predictive modeling community, predictive modeling is a methodology that has been widely used in the financial industry in the past and some of the major failures contributed to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. These failures exemplify the danger of relying exclusively on models that are essentially backward looking in nature. The following examples are by no mean a complete list: 1) Bond rating. S&P;, Moody's and Fitch quantify the probability of default of bonds with discrete variables called rating. The rating can take on discrete values from AAA down to D. The rating is a predictor of the risk of default based on a variety of variables associated with the borrower and historical macroeconomic data. The rating agencies failed with their ratings on the US$600 billion mortgage backed Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) market. Almost the entire AAA sector (and the super-AAA sector, a new rating the rating agencies provided to represent super safe investment) of the CDO market defaulted or severely downgraded during 2008, many of which obtained their ratings less than just a year previously. 2) So far, no statistical models that attempt to predict equity market prices based on historical data are considered to consistently make correct predictions over the long term. One particularly memorable failure is that of Long Term Capital Management, a fund that hired highly qualified analysts, including a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences winner, to develop a sophisticated statistical model that predicted the price spreads between different securities. The models produced impressive profits until a major debacle that caused the then Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to step in to broker a rescue plan by the Wall Street broker dealers in order to prevent a meltdown of the bond market. Possible fundamental limitations of predictive models based on data fitting 1) History cannot always accurately predict the future. Using relations derived from historical data to predict the future implicitly assumes there are certain lasting conditions or constants in a complex system. This almost always leads to some imprecision when the system involves people. 2) The issue of unknown unknowns. In all data collection, the collector first defines the set of variables for which data is collected. However, no matter how extensive the collector considers his/her selection of the variables, there is always the possibility of new variables that have not been considered or even defined, yet are critical to the outcome. 3) Adversarial defeat of an algorithm. After an algorithm becomes an accepted standard of measurement, it can be taken advantage of by people who understand the algorithm and have the incentive to fool or manipulate the outcome. This is what happened to the CDO rating described above. The CDO dealers actively fulfilled the rating agencies' input to reach an AAA or super-AAA on the CDO they were issuing, by cleverly manipulating variables that were \\"unknown\\" to the rating agencies' \\"sophisticated\\" models.

Club career Born in the Ghanaian capital Accra, Addo began his European career brightly at Club Brugge in 1996 and over three seasons at the Jan Breydelstadion made 65 appearances, scoring five goals. At Brugges, he was viewed as a potential superstar on the European stage, after bursting into the first team ranks and helping them to win the Belgian Championship. He was voted the 1997‚Äì98 Young Belgian Footballer of the Year by Belgian journalists and Ghana Player of the Year the same season. He also won the Belgian Ebony Shoe award for being the best African player (or player with African roots) in the Belgian league. The jury was composed of the league clubs' coaches, the Belgian national team coach, sports journalists and an honorary jury. Addo joined PSV Eindhoven during summer 1999 on a five-year contract, although he spent most of his first three years injured or as a substitute. He played just 24 times during this period, going out on loan at Roda JC for two years ‚Äì before finally becoming a regular, as PSV retained their Eredivisie title in 2006. \\"I'm hoping now to show at Roda what I can do,\\" Addo told Dutch magazine Voetbal International. \\"When I moved to PSV there was a lot of pressure and obviously it got worst when I was injured.

However, on 22 May 2007, Addo changed his mind and signed a new contract extension with PSV. On 26 October 2007, Addo was charged with 'committing an act of gross unsporting conduct' and received a four match ban from UEFA for spitting at Fenerbah√ße player Semih ≈ûent√ºrk during an ill- tempered Champions League match on 23 October.

Video game genres are not usually defined by the setting or story of the game or its medium of play, but by the way the player interacts with the game.. For example; a first-person shooter is still a first-person shooter regardless of whether it takes place in a science fiction, fantasy, or military setting; so long as it features a camera mimicking the perspective of the protagonist (first-person) and gameplay centered around the use of ranged weaponry. Genres may encompass a wide variety of games, leading to even more specific classifications called subgenres. For example, an action game can be classified into many subgenres such as platform games and fighting games. Some games, most notably browser and mobile games, are commonly classified into multiple genres.. The following is a list of all commonly defined video game genres, with short descriptions for individual genres and major subgenres.  Action  Action games emphasize physical challenges that require hand-eye coordination and motor skill to overcome. They center around the player, who is in control of most of the action. Most of the earliest video games were considered action games; today, it is still a vast genre covering all games that involve physical challenges. Action games are classified by many subgenres. Platform games and fighting games are among the best-known subgenres, while shooter games became and continue to be one of the dominant genres in video gaming since the 1990s.. Action games usually involve elements of twitch gameplay. = Platform games = 205x205px Platform games (or platformers) have gameplay primarily centered around jumping and climbing to navigate the player's environment. They may have enemies or obstacles to avoid and fight or may just be pure jumping puzzles. Generally the playable characters in a platform game are able to jump many times their own height and the player is offered some control over their movement in midair as well as the height and distance of their jumps. Settings tend to be vertically exaggerated with much uneven terrain that the player can leap up to or fall off of. Donkey Kong (1981) was one of the earliest and best-known platformers; the American gaming press classified it using the term climbing game at the time. Super Mario Bros. (1985) was one of the best-selling games of all time, with more than 40 million copies sold. = Shooter games = Doom, a highly influential first-person shooter.205x205px In shooter games (or simply shooters), players use ranged weapons to participate in the action, which takes place at a distance. Most shooters involve violent gameplay; lethal weaponry is used to damage opponents. However, some shooters, such as Splatoon, have non-violent objectives. Shooters, aside from subgenre classifications, can be further classified by their perspective of play. First-person shooters are played within the protagonist's perspective; they often include a heads-up display showing key information such as the current health of the protagonist.. In third-person shooters, the protagonist's body can be seen fully; the environment is rendered from a distance. Some shooters incorporate both perspectives. Hero shooters are either first- or third-person multiplayer shooters that strongly encourage cooperative play between players on a single team through the use of pre-designed hero characters that each possess unique attributes, skills, weapons, and other passive and active abilities. While setting up a match, players on a team typically must each select a hero who is different from those selected by teammates and, as the match progresses, the players gain experience to unlock more powerful abilities for their hero. Outside of a match, players have the ability to customize the appearance of the heroes but with no other in-game effects. Hero shooters are inspired by the multiplayer online battle arena genre, and popular team-based shooters like Team Fortress 2. Examples of hero shooters include Overwatch, Paladins, and Apex Legends. Light gun shooters are controlled with a gun-shaped controller; light guns function via a light sensor, hence the name \\"light gun\\". The technology has been used as early as the 1920s for shooter games, although electronic video gaming did not exist at that time. 205x205pxShoot 'em ups pit players, who are usually piloting some form of flying vehicle, or flying by some other means, against large waves of opponents; the player is continuously moving and must attack and avoid opponent's attacks as well as obstacles.. Since the 1990s, shooters, most notably first-person shooters, have become widely successful in video gaming, accounting for a large percentage of video game sales. Wolfenstein 3D, created by Id Software and released in 1992, was credited for pioneering gameplay and graphics elements incorporated by many other shooters.. Also developed by Id and published one year after Wolfenstein 3D's release, Doom is broadly considered to be one of the most influential games in video gaming history. Other successful shooter series include Half-Life, a widely acclaimed and commercially successful series noted for its influence on contemporary shooters; and the Call of Duty franchise, with more than 250 million sales across all its titles. = Fighting games = Fighting games center around close-ranged combat typically one-on-one fights or against a small number of equally powerful opponents, often involving violent and exaggerated unarmed attacks. Most fighting games feature a large number of playable characters and a competitive multiplayer mode. While most fighting games emphasize hand-to- hand combat, some fighting games such as Soulcalibur and Samurai Shodown center around combat with melee weapons. Many fighting games incorporate heavily emphasized attacks based on various martial arts systems. Fighting games were one of the dominant genres in video gaming until the late-1990s, where the genre saw a slight decline. This decline was short lived however, for titles such as Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, and Super Smash Bros. dominate the fighter demographic of the modern era. Different sub-genre games are starting to become more popular though. Super Smash Bros., and its deviation from the traditional fighting game rule set is one of these games that has gained a large following because of its \\"fun over form\\" party game development mentality. = Beat 'em up games = Beat 'em ups (or brawlers) are a related, but distinct genre to fighting games. While they both involve close-range combat, beat 'em ups put players against large waves of opponents as opposed to a few. Beat 'em ups often incorporate mechanics from other action genres and multiplayer in beat 'em up games tends to be co-operative rather than competitive. Beat 'em ups saw a sudden decline in popularity in the early 1990s with the release of fighting games, but 3D beat 'em ups have kept the genre alive. Hack and Slash is a sub-genre often used to refer to weapons based beat 'em ups. = Stealth game = These games tend to emphasize sneaking around and avoiding enemy notice over direct conflict, for example, the Metal Gear series, and the Sly Cooper series. In a Stealth game, players are usually still able to engage in loud, conspicuous combat, but are often punished for it. Other games, such as Dishonored, the player can obtain their goal with or without stealth, but stealth is encouraged as the player is at a disadvantage over many of their enemies. The inclusion of stealth as a mechanic in a game does not necessarily make it a Stealth Game. For example, Skyrim has an entire perk tree dedicated to \\"Sneaking\\", but there are few opportunities to use it effectively until the player invests dozens of perks into it, and most of the dungeons in the game are set up in favor of the hack- and-slash strategy that most players adopt. The first stealth game was Manbiki Shounen (Shoplifting Boy), published in November 1979. The PET 2001 personal computer game was developed by Hiroshi Suzuki. Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear was the first mainstream stealth game, with the player starting the game unarmed, and sold over a million copies in the United States. Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake evolved the stealth gameplay of its predecessor. Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 are credited with pioneering stealth mechanics. Metal Gear Solid, which debuted at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show,Metal Gear Solid (Beta + Tech Demo ‚Äì PSX) , Unseen64, April 11, 2008 was the first 3D stealth game, and is credited with popularizing the stealth game genre, as well as the hiding-behind-cover mechanic.Gears of War Review , GamesFirst = Survival games = Survival games start the player off with minimal resources, in a hostile, open-world environment, and require them to collect resources, craft tools, weapons, and shelter, in order to survive as long as possible. Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. They may overlap with the survival horror genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse. = Battle Royale games = A battle royale game is a genre that blends the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a survival game with last man standing gameplay. Battle royale games challenge a large number of players, starting with minimal equipment, to search for weapons and armor and eliminate other opponents, while trying to stay in safe playable area which shrinks as the time passes, with the winner being the last competitor in the game. Notable battle royale games include PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Fortnite Battle Royale, Apex Legends, and Call of Duty: Warzone, each having received tens of millions of players within months of their releases. = Rhythm games = alt= Rhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a player's sense of rhythm. The genre includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player is required to press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat. PaRappa the Rapper has been deemed the first influential rhythm game; whose basic template formed the core of subsequent games in the genre. Other popular rhythm games include Dance Dance Revolution, Maimai, Project Diva, Cytus, Love Live: School Idol Festival, The Idolmaster, osu!, Taiko no Tatsujin, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Rhythm Heaven, etc.  Action-adventure  Action-adventure games combine elements of their two component genres, typically featuring long-term obstacles that must be overcome using a tool or item as leverage (which is collected earlier), as well as many smaller obstacles almost constantly in the way, that require elements of action games to overcome. Action-adventure games tend to focus on exploration and usually involve item gathering, simple puzzle solving, and combat. \\"Action-adventure\\" has become a label which is sometimes attached to games which do not fit neatly into another well known genre. Because of their prevalence on video game consoles and the absence of typical adventure games, action-adventure games are often called \\"adventure games\\" by modern gamers. One of the first action-adventure games was the Atari 2600 game Adventure (1980). It was directly inspired by the original text adventure, Colossal Cave Adventure. In the process of adapting a text game to a console with only a joystick for control, designer Warren Robinett created an action-adventure game by incorporating action arcade game elements. The action-adventure later became an established genre with Shigeru Miyamoto's The Legend of Zelda (1986), which became a success due to how it combined elements from different genres to create a compelling hybrid, including exploration, transport puzzles, adventure-style inventory puzzles, an action component, a monetary system, and simplified RPG-style level building without the experience points. The game was also an early example of open world, non-linear gameplay, and introduced innovations like saving on battery backup. It became one of the most influential games of the 8-bit era, inspiring action-adventures like Metroid and RPGs like Final Fantasy. Zelda has since remained the most prolific action-adventure game series through to the present day. = Survival horror = Survival horror games focus on fear and attempt to scare the player via traditional horror fiction elements such as atmospherics, death, the undead, blood and gore. One crucial gameplay element in many of these games is the low quantity of ammunition, or number of breakable melee weapons. Notable examples include Silent Hill and Resident Evil. Nostromo was the first survival horror game, developed by Akira Takiguchi, a Tokyo University student and Taito contractor, for the PET 2001. It was ported to the PC-6001 by Masakuni Mitsuhashi (also known as Hiromi Ohba, later joined Game Arts), and published by ASCII in 1981, exclusively for Japan. = Metroidvania = Metroidvania games are a subgenre of platformer, named after its two first well-known franchises, Metroid and Castlevania. They feature large interconnected world maps the player can explore, but access to parts of the world is limited by doors or other obstacles that can only be opened after the player has acquired special tools, weapons or abilities within the game. Acquiring such improvements also aids the player in defeating more difficult enemies and locating shortcuts and secret areas, and often includes retracing one's steps across the map. Metroidvanias usually do not consist of any linear gameplay and often involve much backtracking - especially after new powerups or tools have been obtained.  Adventure  Adventure games were some of the earliest games created, beginning with the text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure in the 1970s. That game was originally titled simply \\"Adventure,\\" and is the namesake of the genre. Over time, graphics have been introduced to the genre and the interface has evolved. Unlike adventure films, adventure games are not defined by story or content. Rather, adventure describes a manner of gameplay without reflex challenges or action. They normally require the player to solve various puzzles by interacting with people or the environment, most often in a non- confrontational way. It is considered a \\"purist\\" genre and tends to exclude anything which includes action elements beyond a mini game. Because they put little pressure on the player in the form of action-based challenges or time constraints, adventure games have had the unique ability to appeal to people who do not normally play video games. The genre peaked in popularity with the 1993 release of Myst, the best-selling PC game of all time up to that point. The simple point and click interface, detailed worlds and casual pace made it accessible, and its sense of artistic surrealism caused news outlets such as Wired Magazine, The New York Times, and the San Francisco Chronicle to declare that the gaming industry had matured. It had four proper sequels, but none managed to experience the same level of success. The success of Myst also inspired many others to create similar games with first person perspectives, surreal environments and minimal or no dialogue, but these neither recaptured the success of Myst nor of earlier personality-driven adventures. In the late 1990s the genre suffered a large drop in popularity, mass-market releases became rare, and many proclaimed the adventure game to be dead. More accurately, it has become a niche genre. Adventure games are not entirely uncommon, but they tend to be very low budget in anticipation of modest sales. The genre was somewhat rejuvenated with the release of The Longest Journey in 1999, which emphasized stronger story elements and more interaction with different characters. A recent resurgence of adventure games on Nintendo consoles might signify a new interest in the genre. A successful Kickstarter campaign in 2012, run by Doublefine Studios, also spoke to the continued interest in Adventure games. The game produced as a result was mired in controversy and production delays, and to some, signalled the true end of the genre outside of niche markets. = Text adventures = The earliest adventure games were text adventures, also known as interactive fiction. Games such as the popular Zork series of the late 1970s and early 1980s allowed the player to use a keyboard to enter commands such as \\"get rope\\" or \\"go west\\" while the computer describes what is happening. A great deal of programming went into parsing the player's text input. = Graphic adventures = Mystery House for the Apple II was the first adventure game to use graphics in the early home computer era. Graphic adventure games emerged as graphics became more common. Adventure games began to supplement and later on replace textual descriptions with visuals (for example, a picture of the current location). Early graphic adventure games used text-parsers to input commands. The growing use of mice led to the \\"point-and-click\\" genre of adventure games, where the player would no longer have to type commands. The player could, for example, click on a hand icon and then on a rope to pick up the rope. = Visual novels = A is a game featuring mostly static graphics, usually with anime-style art. As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels or tableau vivant stage plays. Many visual novels track statistics that the player must build in order to advance the plot, and permit a variety of endings, allowing more dynamic reactions to the player's actions than a typical linear adventure plot. Many visual novels are dating sims, including bish≈çjo games. Visual novels are especially prevalent in Japan, where they make up nearly 70% of PC games released. They are rarely produced for video game consoles, but the more popular games are sometimes ported to systems such as the Dreamcast or the PlayStation 2. The market for visual novels outside Japan, however, was nearly non-existent prior to the success of the Nintendo DS, for which several Japanese visual novels were released in the West, such as the Ace Attorney series. = Interactive movie = The interactive movie genre came about with the invention of laserdiscs. An interactive movie contains pre-filmed full- motion cartoons or live-action sequences, where the player controls some of the moves of the main character. For example, when in danger, the player decides which move, action, or combination to choose. In these games, the only activity the player has is to choose or guess the move the designers intend him to make. Interactive movies usually differ from games that simply use full motion video, FMV, extensively between scenes in that they try to integrate it into the gameplay itself. This has been used in everything from racing games to fighting games. A few adventure game have tried to use the term to liken the storytelling of their games to those in movies, most notably the later Tex Murphy games and the more recent Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy), although they are more aptly classified as genre hybrids. Elements of interactive movies have been adapted for game cut scenes, in the form of Quick Time Events, to keep the player alert. Games like Resident Evil 4 present obvious in-game prompts for the player to react to. Not doing so usually results in the player character either getting hurt or outright killed. = Real-time 3D adventures = Around this time, real-time 3D adventure games appeared. These included Nightfall in 1998, Shenmue in 1999, realMyst in 2000, Shadow of Memories in 2001, and Uru: Ages Beyond Myst in 2003. They augmented traditional adventure gameplay with some of the attributes more commonly associated with action games. For example, freedom of motion and physics-based behavior.  Role- playing  KQ is a role-playing game Role-playing video games draw their gameplay from traditional tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. Most of these games cast the player in the role of a weak character that grows in strength and experience over the course of the game. By overcoming difficult challenges and/or defeating monsters, the player gains experience points which represent the character's progress in a chosen profession or class (such as melee combat or ranged magic spells) and allow the player to gain new abilities once a set amount are obtained. Many RPGs contain an open world known as an overworld, which is usually populated with monsters, that allows access to more important game locations, such as towns, dungeons, and castles. Since the emergence of affordable home computers coincided with the popularity of paper and pencil role-playing games, this genre was one of the first in video games and continues to be popular today. Gameplay elements strongly associated with RPG, such as statistical character development through the acquisition of experience points, have been widely adapted to other genres such as action-adventure games. Though nearly all of the early entries in the genre were turn-based games, many modern role-playing games progress in real-time. Thus, the genre has followed the strategy game's trend of moving from turn-based to real-time combat. The move to real-time combat began with the release of Square's (now Square Enix's) Final Fantasy IV, the first game to use the Active Time Battle system; this was quickly followed by truly real-time action role-playing games such as the Mana series, Soul Blazer and Ultima VII. Although older turn-based system still exist, such as the Golden Sun series for Game Boy Advance as well as Pok√©mon. = Action RPG = Video showing basic point and click action RPG gameplay. The action role- playing game or action RPG is a type of role-playing video game which incorporates real-time combat as opposed to turn-based or menu-based, often borrowing elements from action games or action-adventure games. Some of the first action role-playing games were produced by Nihon Falcom in the 1980s, such as the Dragon Slayer series and Ys series. Later so-called \\"Diablo clones\\" are also part of this genre. Although the precise definition of the genre varies, the typical action RPG features a heavy emphasis on combat, often simplifying or removing non-combat attributes and statistics and the effect they have on the character's development. Additionally, combat always takes place using a real-time system (hence the \\"action\\") that relies on the player's ability to perform particular actions with speed and accuracy to determine success, rather than mainly using the player character's attributes to determine this. = MMORPG = Massively multiplayer online role-playing games, or MMORPG, emerged in the mid to late 1990s as a commercial, graphical variant of text-based MUDs, which had existed since 1978. By and large, MMORPG feature the usual RPG objectives of completing quests and strengthening one's player character, but involve up to hundreds of players interacting with each other on the same persistent world in real-time. The massively multiplayer concept was quickly combined with other genres. Fantasy MMORPG, like Final Fantasy XI, The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar, and The Elder Scrolls Online, remain the most popular type of MMOG, with the most popular \\"pay-to-play\\" game being World of Warcraft, and the most popular \\"free-to- play\\" games including RuneScape and TERA, yet other types of MMORPG are appearing. Sci-fi MMORPG like Phantasy Star Online hold a smaller part of the market, with the popular space sci-fi game EVE Online being the most notable. Other massively multiplayer online games which do not have a conventional RPG setting include Second Life and Ingress. = Roguelikes = alt= The roguelike video game subgenre borrows its name and gameplay elements from the 1980 computer game Rogue. Superficially, a roguelike is a two-dimensional dungeon crawl with a high degree of randomness via procedural generation, an emphasis on statistical character development, and the use of permadeath. Though traditionally featuring a text user interface, many such games utilize graphic tiles to overcome character set limitations. Newer gamers that move away from traditional hack-and-slash elements but otherwise keeping procedural generation and permadeath features are sometimes called \\"rogue-lites\\". = Tactical RPG = The tactical role-playing game subgenre principally refers to games which incorporate gameplay from strategy games as an alternative to traditional RPG systems. Like standard RPG, the player controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies, but this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid. The genre has its origins in tabletop role-playing games, where each player has time to decide his or her characters' actions. = Sandbox RPG = Sandbox RPG or Open World RPG allow the player a large amount of freedom and usually contain a somewhat more open free-roaming (meaning the player is not confined to a single path restricted by rocks or fences etc.) world. Sandbox RPGs contain similarities to other sandbox games such as the Grand Theft Auto series, with a large number of interactable non-player characters, large amount of content and typically some of the largest worlds to explore and longest playtimes of all RPG due to an impressive amount of secondary content not critical to the game's main storyline. Sandbox RPG often attempt to emulate an entire region of their setting. Popular examples of this subgenre include the Dragon Slayer series by Nihon Falcom, the early Dragon Quest games by Chunsoft, Zelda II by Nintendo, Wasteland by Interplay Entertainment, the SaGa and Mana series by Squaresoft, System Shock 2 by Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios, Deus Ex by Ion Storm, The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series by Bethesda Softworks and Interplay Entertainment, Fable by Lionhead Studios, the Gothic series by Piranha Bytes, and the Xenoblade Chronicles series by Monolith Soft. =First- person party-based RPG= Screenshot of Damnation of Gods, a Dungeon Master clone. All four members of the players's party move around the game world as a single unit in first-person perspective. Also known as DRPG (Dungeon RPG), this subgenre consists of RPGs where the player leads a party of adventurers in first-person perspective through a dungeon or labyrinth, typically in a grid-based environment. Examples include the aforementioned Wizardry, Might and Magic and Bard's Tale series; as well as the Etrian Odyssey and Elminage series. Games of this type are also known as \\"blobbers\\", since the player moves the entire party around the playing field as a single unit, or \\"blob\\". Most \\"blobbers\\" are turn-based, but some titles such as the Dungeon Master, Legend of Grimrock, and Eye of the Beholder series are played in real-time. Early games in this genre lack an automap feature, forcing players to draw their own maps in order to keep track of their progress. Environmental and spatial puzzles are common, meaning players may have to, for instance, move a stone in one part of the level in order to open a gate in another part of the level. =JRPG= Japanese role-playing games tend to have a more linear story and a set cast of characters, they generally also have a large amount of enemy encounters and sometimes the necessity to grind in order to progress further into the game. Some games include Chrono Trigger for the SNES, Final Fantasy VII, and many more. =Monster Collection= A variant of the RPG formula where the protagonist collects creatures that fight instead of the player themselves. Examples of monster collection games include Pok√©mon and Temtem.  Simulation  Simulation video games is a diverse super-category of games, generally designed to closely simulate aspects of a real or fictional reality. = Construction and management simulation = Lincity NG Construction and management simulations (or CMS) are a type of simulation game which task players to build, expand or manage fictional communities or projects with limited resources. In city-building games the player acts as overall planner or leader to meet the needs and wants of game characters by initiating structures for food, shelter, health, spiritual care, economic growth, etc. Success is achieved when the city budget makes a growing profit and citizens experience an upgraded lifestyle in housing, health, and goods. While military development is often included, the emphasis is on economic strength. Perhaps the most known game of this type is SimCity, which is still popular and has had great influence on later city-building games. SimCity, however, also belongs to the God Games genre since it gives the player god-like abilities in manipulating the world. Caesar was a long-running series in this genre, with the original game spawning three sequels. Business simulation games generally attempt to simulate an economy or business, with the player controlling the economy of the game. A government simulation game (or \\"political game\\") involves the simulation of the policies, government or politics of a country, but typically excludes warfare. Recently, these types of games have gained the moniker \\"serious game\\". = Life simulation = Life simulation games (or artificial life games) involve living or controlling one or more artificial lives. A life simulation game can revolve around individuals and relationships, or it could be a simulation of an ecosystem. Biological simulations may allow the player to experiment with genetics, survival or ecosystems, often in the form of an educational package. An early example is SimLife, while relatively recent ones are Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis and Spore. In other educational simulations such as Wolf, the player \\"lives the life\\" of an individual animal in a relatively realistic way. Hailed as one of the greatest life simulation games, however, is Creatures, Creatures 2, Creatures 3, where the player breeds generations of a species in a hugely detailed ecosystem. Unlike other genres of games, god games often do not have a set goal that allows a player to win the game. The focus of a god game tends to be control over the lives of people, anywhere from micromanaging a family to overseeing the rise of a civilization. Pet-raising simulations (or digital pets) focus more on the relationship between the player and one or few life forms. They are often more limited in scope than other biological simulations. This includes popular examples of virtual pets such as Tamagotchi, the Petz series, and Nintendogs. Social simulation games base their gameplay on the social interaction between multiple artificial lives. The most famous example from this genre is Will Wright's The Sims. Dating sims and Romance simulation games fall under this category. = Vehicle simulation = Vehicle simulation games are a genre of video games which attempt to provide the player with a realistic interpretation of operating various kinds of vehicles. 230x230px Flight simulation tasks the player with flying an aircraft, usually an airplane, as realistically as possible. Combat flight simulators are the most popular subgenre of simulation. The player controls the plane, not only simulating the act of flying, but also combat situations. There are also civilian flight simulators that do not have the combat aspect. Racing games typically place the player in the driver's seat of a high-performance vehicle and require the player to race against other drivers or sometimes just time. This genre of games is one of the staples of the computer gaming world and many of the earliest computer games created were part of this genre. Emerging in the late 1970s, this genre is still very popular today and continues to push the envelope in terms of graphics and performance. These games \\"tend to fall into organized racing and imaginary racing categories\\". Organized racing simulators attempt to \\"reproduce the experience of driving a racing car or motorcycle in an existing racing class: Indycar, NASCAR, Formula 1, and so on.\\" On the other hand, imaginary racing games involve \\"imaginary situations, driving madly through cities or the countryside or even fantasy environments\\". These \\"imaginary\\" racing games are sometimes called arcade racing games, in contrast to their more realistic \\"racing simulation\\" counterparts. These include Need For Speed, Mario Kart and Gran Turismo. Rollings and Adams note that \\"racing games are often sold in the sports category,\\" but \\"from a design standpoint, they really belong in ... vehicle simulations\\". Space flight simulator games are a subgenre that involve piloting a spacecraft. Space simulators are different from other subgenres, and are not generally considered to be simulators, as their simulated objects do not always exist and often disregard the laws of physics. Train simulators simulate the vehicles, environments and often economics associated with railway transport. These are frequently historical in nature, reminiscing on the evolution and emergence of the railroad in various countries and the economic booms that often accompanied them. Vehicular combat or car combat games focus on fast- paced action, as the player operates a car or other vehicle and attempts to disable or destroy CPU or human opponents. Vehicular combat games often allow a player to choose from a variety of potential vehicles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Vehicular combat was born out of racing/shooter combinations like Spy Hunter, RoadBlasters, and Rock 'N' Roll Racing, but differs in that the players can, if desired, take their vehicles off predefined routes and do battle wherever they please. A subgenre of vehicular combat is Mecha combat, where vehicles generally include giant robot-like tanks.  Strategy  Strategy video games focus on gameplay requiring careful and skillful thinking and planning in order to achieve victory and the action scales from world domination to squad-based tactics. ‚ÄúIn most strategy video games,‚Äù says Andrew Rollings, \\"the player is given a godlike view of the game world, indirectly controlling the units under his command.\\" Rollings also notes that \\"The origin of strategy games is rooted in their close cousins, board games.\\" Strategy video games generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time and whether the game's focus is upon strategy or tactics. Real time strategy games are often a multiple unit selection game (multiple game characters can be selected at once to perform different tasks, as opposed to only selecting one character at a time) with a sky view (view looking down from above) but some recent games such as Tom Clancy's EndWar, are single unit selection and third person view. Like many RPG games, many strategy games are gradually moving away from turn-based systems to more real-time systems. = 4X game = 4X refers to a genre of strategy video game with four primary goals: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. A 4X game can be turn-based or real-time. Perhaps the best known example of this genre is Sid Meier's Civilization series. 4X games often cover a very large period of time, giving the player the control of an entire civilization or species. Typically these games have a historical setting, encompassing a large amount of human history (Empire Earth, Civilization, Golden Age of Civilizations) or a science fiction setting where the player controls a species set to dominate the galaxy (Master of Orion, Galactic Civilizations). = Artillery game = Scorched 3D is an artillery game. Artillery is the generic name for early two or three-player (usually turn-based) computer games involving tanks fighting each other in combat or similar derivative games. Artillery games were among the earliest computer games developed and can be considered an extension of the original use of computers, which were once used for military-based calculations such as plotting the trajectories of rockets. Artillery games are considered a type of turn-based tactics game, though they have also been described as a type of \\"shooting game.\\" Examples of this genre are Pocket Tanks, Hogs of War, Scorched 3D and the Worms series. = Auto battler (Auto chess) = Auto battler, also known as \\"auto chess\\", is a type of strategy game that features chess-like elements where players place characters on a grid-shaped battlefield during a preparation phase, who then fight the opposing team's characters without any further direct input from the player. It was created and popularized by Dota Auto Chess in early 2019, and saw more games in the genre by other studios, such as Teamfight Tactics, Dota Underlords, and Hearthstone Battlegrounds releasing soon after. = Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) = Vainglory is a multiplayer online battle arena game designed for smartphones and tablets.269x269px Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) is a genre of strategy video games in which each player controls a single character with a set of unique abilities that improve over the course of a game and which contribute to the team's overall strategy. Players work together as a team to achieve a victory condition which is to destroy the opposing team's main structure whilst protecting their own. Player characters, typically called \\"heroes\\" or \\"champions\\", are assisted by computer-controlled units that periodically spawn in groups and march forward along set paths (called \\"lanes\\") toward their enemy's base. Defensive structures, which are usually automatic \\"towers\\", are in place to prevent this. The first team to destroy the opponents' main structure wins the match. The genre is seen as a fusion of real-time strategy games, role-playing games, and action games, however, players usually do not construct either buildings or units. This type of multiplayer online video games gained popularity in early 2010s, with Defense of the Ancients mod for Warcraft III, League of Legends, Dota 2, Heroes of the Storm, and Smite being popular. MOBA games are well-represented in esports as well. In 2018, prize pools reached over US$60 million, 40% of the year's total esports prize pools. = Real-time strategy (RTS) = The moniker \\"real-time strategy\\" (RTS), usually applied only to certain computer strategy games, (however, this genre is probably the most well known of strategy games and is what most websites mean when they say \\"strategy games\\") indicates that the action in the game is continuous, and players will have to make their decisions and actions within the backdrop of a constantly changing game state. Real-time strategy gameplay is characterised by obtaining resources, building bases, researching technologies and producing units. Blizzard Entertainment's Starcraft is a popular RTS played competitively in South Korea and televised to large audiences. Other notable games include the Warcraft series, Age of Empires series, Dawn of War, Company of Heroes, Command and Conquer, and Dune II (essentially the first RTS game). Outside of PCs, very few strategy games are real-time; a few examples are Battle for Middle-earth II, Pikmin and Halo Wars. Even fewer ones use physical pieces, such as Icehouse. = Real-time tactics (RTT) = Real-time tactics (abbreviated RTT(Article at IGN discussing their perception of RTS and related genres as of 2006. RTT is discussed as a new and not yet established genre from the publisher's perspective.) and less commonly referred to as \\"fixed- unit real-time strategy\\") is a subgenre of tactical wargames played in real- time simulating the considerations and circumstances of operational warfare and military tactics. It is also sometimes considered a subgenre of real-time strategy, and thus may in this context exist as an element of gameplay or as a basis for the whole game. It is differentiated from real-time strategy gameplay by the lack of resource micromanagement and base or unit building, as well as the greater importance of individual units and a focus on complex battlefield tactics. Example titles include Warhammer: Dark Omen, World In Conflict, the Close Combat series, and early tactical role-playing games such as Bokosuka Wars, Silver Ghost, and First Queen. = Tower defense = Tower defense games have a very simple layout. Usually, computer-controlled monsters called creeps move along a set path, and the player must place, or \\"build\\" towers along this path to kill the creeps. In some games, towers are placed along a set path for creeps, while in others towers can interrupt creep movement and change their path. In most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such as poisoning enemies or slowing them down. The player is awarded money for killing creeps, and this money can be used to buy more towers, or buy upgrades for a tower such as increased power or range. = Turn-based strategy (TBS) = The Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based strategy game. The term turn-based strategy (TBS) is usually reserved for certain computer strategy games, to distinguish them from real-time strategy games. A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis before committing to a game action, and some games allow a certain number of moves or actions to take place in a turn. Like real-time strategy games, this genre can include many strategy games which are not solely turn-based games, and games which may contain other features not related to whether the game is turn-based or not. Examples of this genre are the Civilization, Heroes of Might and Magic, Making History, and Master of Orion. Some recent turn-based strategy games feature a different gameplay mechanic, with a simultaneous resolution of the turns, every player preparing their future actions in the planning phase, then letting the game follow the orders given at the same time, causing orders to be interrupted by the opponent(s) actions, changing the gameplay from reacting to the opponent's action into guessing them. = Turn-based tactics (TBT) = The gameplay of turn-based tactics games (TBT) is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Examples of this genre include the Wars, Jagged Alliance and X-COM series, as well as tactical role-playing games such as the Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics. = Wargame = Wargames are a subgenre of strategy video games that emphasize strategic or tactical warfare on a map. Wargames generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time and whether the game's focus is upon military strategy or tactics. = Grand strategy wargame = A grand strategy wargame is a wargame that places focus on grand strategy: military strategy at the level of movement and use of an entire nation state or empire's resources.  Sports  Sports are video games that simulate sports. This opposing team(s) can be controlled by other real life people or artificial intelligence. = Racing = One competes against time or opponents using some means of transportation. Sub-genres include racing simulators (Gran Turismo) and kart racing (Mario Kart). = Sports game = Sports games emulate the playing of traditional physical sports. Some emphasize actually playing the sport, while others emphasize the strategy behind the sport (such as Championship Manager). Others satirize the sport for comic effect (such as Arch Rivals). One of the best selling series in this genre is the FIFA series. This genre emerged early in the history of video games (e.g., Pong) and remains popular today. = Competitive = Games that have high competitive factor but does not represent any traditional sports or the concept is fictional designed by the developer (e.g. Ball Jacks). = Sports-based fighting = Sports-based fighting games are titles that fall firmly within the definitions of both the Fighting game and Sports game genre, such as boxing and wrestling video games. As such, they are usually put in their own separate subgenres. Often the fighting is far more realistic than in traditional fighting games (though the amount of realism can greatly vary), and many feature real-world franchises or fighters. Examples of this include the Fight Night, UFC and WWE 2K series.  MMO  A massively multiplayer online game (also called MMO and MMOG) is a multiplayer online video game which is capable of supporting large numbers of players simultaneously. By necessity, they are played on the Internet. Many games have at least one persistent world, however others just have large numbers of players competing at once in one form or another without any lasting effect to the world at all. These games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including the personal computer, video game console, or smartphones and other mobile devices. An example is the widely played game Minecraft which can be played both as an MMO or a single player game. MMO games can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully with people around the world. They include a variety of gameplay types, representing many video game genres, such as MMORPG, MMOFPS, MMORTS, MMOTBS and MMO simulation games.  Other notable genres  = Board game or card game = Many popular board games and card games have computer versions. AI opponents can help improve one's skill at traditional games. Chess, Checkers, Othello (also known as Reversi), and Backgammon have world class computer programs. Mahjong and related games are immensely popular in China and Japan. Go is popular in East Asia, though it is notoriously difficult to program a computer to play Go well. = Casual games = Casual games are designed to be easily picked up and put down again, allowing for potentially short bursts of play, such as Call of Duty and most games on a mobile platform. This genre of gaming is meant to be a short and relaxing pastime, a rest in between other occupations and so is most popular with demographics who have less free time. For this reason the games often have auto-saving and syncing as standard so the games can be minimised, put into sleep or otherwise put down with no loss to the player. Market leaders in this genre are often boldly coloured, designed for intuitive interaction and have a high balance of reward to time to keep people coming back. Designers of these games should add a lot of \\"juice\\" (sound and motion elements that excite the senses) to make them stand out in a sea of highly similar games. Due to the aforementioned requirements, many of these games are quite simple to pick up and play without lengthy tutorials. Retaining players involves a lot of careful design of levels, challenges and events. = Digital collectible card game = A digital collectible card game (DCCG) is a computer or video game usually played online that emulates collectible card games (CCG), or in many cases, doesn't use card-like images at all, but instead icons, avatars or other symbols to represent game pieces. Originally, DCCGs started out as replications of a CCG's physical counterpart such as Magic: The Gathering, but many DCCGs have foregone a physical version and exclusively release as a video game, such as with Hearthstone. = Horror game = Horror games are games that incorporate elements of horror fiction into their narrative, generally irrespective of the type of gameplay. It is the only major video game genre that is recognized by narrative elements rather than by gameplay, gameplay mode, or platform. Survival horror is a subgenre of horror games focused on action-adventure style of gameplay. =Idle game= In an IGN article, Cookie Clicker is credited as one of the few games to have played a major role in the establishment of the genre of idle gaming. This genre involves games that orient the player with a trivial task, such as clicking a cookie; and as the game progresses, the player is gradually rewarded certain upgrades for completing said task. In all, these games require very little involvement from the player, and in most cases they play themselves; hence the use of the word \\"idle\\". In early 2014, Orteil released an early version of Idle Game Maker, a tool allowing customized idle games to be made without coding knowledge. = Logic game = Logic games require the player to solve logic puzzles or navigate complex locations such as mazes. They are well suited to casual play, and tile-matching puzzle games are among the most popular casual games. This genre frequently crosses over with adventure and educational games. Tetris, labeled a puzzle game, is credited for revolutionizing gaming and popularizing the puzzle genre. =Mobile game= Mobile games are played on devices like phones and tablets, and are usually easy games for casual gamers. Games like Candy Crush Saga and Angry Birds are mobile games. Some mobile games are ported from consoles or computers, like Minecraft, Plants vs Zombies, and Fortnite. Mobile games are usually made for casual gamers and can be played and completed easily, so they can be played by people of all ages. = Party game = Party games are video games developed specifically for multiplayer games between many players. Normally, party games have a variety of mini-games that range between collecting more of a certain item than other players or having the fastest time at something. Such games include the Mario Party series, Crash Bash, and Rayman Raving Rabbids. Versus multiplayer games are not generally considered to be party games. = Programming game = A programming game is a computer game where the player has no direct influence on the course of the game. Instead, a computer program or script is written in some domain-specific programming language in order to control the actions of the characters (usually robots, tanks or bacteria, which seek to destroy each other). In SpaceChem, for example, players design circuits used for creating molecules from raw materials. Final Fantasy XII also includes some elements of a programming game, as the player creates the AI of his characters, although the player can also choose to directly control the action. = Trivia game = Trivia games are growing in popularity, especially on mobile phones where people may only have a few minutes to play the game. In trivia games, the object is to answer questions with the goal of obtaining points. They may be based on real-life trivia game shows such as Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? or Family Feud. = Typing game = A typing game is any game that uses typing as the main method of interaction. While they initially started as a type of educational game, they later became more entertainment focused as indie developers explored possibilities within the genre.  Video game genres by purpose  While most video games are designed as entertainment, many video games are designed with additional purposes. These purposes are as varied as the nature of information itself‚Äîto inform, persuade, or stimulate. These games can have any kind of gameplay, from puzzles to action to adventure. = Advergame = Advergames, in the context of video game genres, refers to promotional software specifically made to advertise a product, organization or viewpoint. The first advergames were distributed on floppy disk by the Chef Boyardee, Coca-Cola, and Samsung brands, while the first cereal box advergame was Chex Quest in 1996. The majority of advergames are found online and mostly include simple and cheaply made Flash games. Some advergames were released to consoles, like Pepsiman for Sony PlayStation. = Art game = Art games are designed so as to emphasize art or whose structures are intended to produce some kind of non-ludological reaction in its audience. Art games typically go out of their way to have a unique, unconventional look, often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design. This concept extends to the realm of modified (\\"modded\\") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non- art-games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling. Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as \\"videogame art.\\" = Casual game = Casual games have very simple rules or play techniques and a very low degree of strategy. They also require no long-term time commitment or special skills to play, making them easy to learn and play as a pastime. There are comparatively low production and distribution costs for the producer. Casual games typically are played on a personal computer online in web browsers, although they now are starting to become popular on game consoles. The purpose of the casual game is to entertain, but with a much lower commitment than other video games. = Christian game = Christian games attempt to provide the dual purposes of spreading the Christian religion to non-believers through the medium of video games, and providing gamers who identify as Christian with a common pool of games. Christian video games were first developed by Wisdom Tree for the NES, without license. While largely regarded as derivative titles by the mainstream gaming culture, Christian games have nevertheless expanded in distribution since their inception. = Educational game = Educational games, as the name implies, attempt to teach the user using the game as a vehicle. Most of these types of games target young users from the ages of about three years to mid- teens; past the mid-teens, subjects become so complex (e.g. Calculus) that teaching via a game is impractical. Numerous subgenres exist, in fields such as math or typing. = Esports = Esports games are multiplayer games that are usually played competitively at the professional level. These games are often targeted at the \\"hardcore\\" gaming audience, and are usually first-person shooter games, requiring twitch-based reaction speed and coordination, or real-time strategy games, requiring high levels of strategic macro- and micromanagement, or MOBAs, requiring both. = Exergame = An exergame (portmanteau of \\"exercise\\" and \\"game\\") is a video game that provides exercise. \\"Exergames\\" sub-divide into two main implementations, those with a game specifically designed to use an exercise input device (for example, the game Wii Fit using the Wii Balance Board) and those implementations using a genre of a game. Games fit into the category of entertainment, and similarly \\"exergames\\" are a category of \\"exertainment\\" (formed from \\"exercise\\" and \\"entertainment\\"). \\"Exertainment\\" refers to one aspect of adding entertainment to an exercise workout. = Personalized game = Personalized games are created for one specific player or a group of players usually as a gift. They are hand-made to feature real names, places and events from the recipient's life. Usual occasions for such games are birthdays, anniversaries, and engagement proposals. = Serious game = Serious games are intended to educate or train the player. These games tend to promote \\"education, science, social change, health care or even the military.\\" Some of these games have no specific ending or goal in the game. Rather, the player learns a real life lesson from the game. For example, games from websites such as Newsgaming.com and gamesforchange.org raise political issues using the distinct properties of games.  Multi-Genre  = Survival-Action-Adventure = A Genre that is a combination of the genres; Survival, Action & Adventure. A very hard Genre to get right and one where most games under this genre fail to live up to the genre. One Highly Notable example of A successful Game that falls into this genre is Subnautica which is often referred to as the standard for this genre. = Cross-Genre = A Cross-Genre game is a game that is unable to be placed in any one genre. This genre typically consists of Platforms that are UGC dependent a notable example of this is Roblox although Roblox is typically considered an MMORPG, A sizeable Portion of Roblox's UGC does not fall into this category. Hence the Platform which is commonly referred to as one Game falls into this category, due to the distinct variety of content that falls within various Genres = Narrative-Adventure = A game that is Primarily driven by the narrative while containing many aspects of a typical adventure game  Sandbox / open world games  Sandbox and open-world games are not specifically video game genres, as they generally describe gameplay features, but often games will be described as a sandbox or an open-world game as if it were a defining genre. They are included here for such distinguishing purposes. = Sandbox = A sandbox game is a video game with a gameplay element that gives the player a great degree of creativity to complete tasks towards a goal within the game, if such a goal exists. Some games exist as pure sandbox games with no objectives; these are also known as non-games or software toys. More commonly, sandbox games results from these creative elements being incorporated into other genres and allowing for emergent gameplay. Sandbox games are often associated with open world concepts which gives the player freedom of movement and progression in the game's world. The \\"sandbox\\" term derives from the nature of a sandbox that lets children create nearly anything they want within it. Early sandbox games came out of space trading and combat games like Elite (1984) and city-building simulations and tycoon games like SimCity (1989). The releases of The Sims and Grand Theft Auto III in 2000 and 2001, respectively, demonstrated that games with highly detailed interacting systems that encouraged player experimentation could also be seen as sandbox games. Sandbox games also found ground with the ability to interact socially and share user-generated content across the Internet like Second Life (2003). Minecraft (2011) is one of the most successful examples of a sandbox game, with players able to enjoy in both creative modes and through more goal-driven survival modes. = Creative = Creative games are games that are often grounded into other genres but have certain modes of gameplay that allow for a Sandbox and/or Openworld Gameplay, It is extremely common for a \\"Creative\\" Game mode to use the same aspects, assets, mechanics, etc. of the Parent Game. However, this isn't always the case as some games have used assets unavialable in the normal Game. Story/Narrative is often removed or non-existent in these modes. However, while generally rare, creative modes have been seen to have an independent story from the main game or even be an entirely independent game. = Open world = In video games, an open world is a game mechanic of using a virtual world that the player can explore and approach objectives freely, as opposed to a world with more linear and structured gameplay. While games have used open-world designs since the 1980s, the implementation in Grand Theft Auto III (2001) set a standard that has been used since. Games with open or free-roaming worlds typically lack level structures like walls and locked doors, or the invisible walls in more open areas that prevent the player from venturing beyond them; only at the bounds of an open-world game will players be limited by geographic features like vast oceans or impassible mountains. Players typically do not encounter loading screens common in linear level designs when moving about the game world, with the open-world game using strategic storage and memory techniques to load the game world in a dynamic and seamless manner. Open-world games still enforce many restrictions in the game environment, either because of absolute technical limitations or in-game limitations imposed by a game's linearity. While the openness of the game world is an important facet to games featuring open worlds, the main draw of open-world games is about providing the player with autonomy - not so much the freedom to do anything they want in the game (which is nearly impossible with current computing technology), but the ability to choose how to approach the game and its challenges in the order and manner as the player desires while still constrained by gameplay rules. Examples of high level of autonomy in computer games can be found in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) or in single-player games adhering to the open-world concept such as the Fallout series. The main appeal of open-world gameplay is that they provide a simulated reality and allow players to develop their character and its behaviour in the direction and the pace of their own choosing. In these cases, there is often no concrete goal or end to the game, although there may be the main storyline, such as with games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.  Scientific studies  As video games are increasingly the subject of scientific studies, game genres are themselves becoming a subject of study. An early attempt at analysis of the action and adventure genres appeared in a Game Developers Conference 2000 paper 'Mostly Armless: Grabbing the 3D World'. This critiqued a variety of adventure and action games to categorize gameplay and interaction for adventure, action, and hybrid genres. It provided a graph of the genres along the axes of 'immediacy' vs 'complexity', with an 'ideal-zone' for gameplay that covered and linked adventure and action games. It detailed various interaction styles present in these genres and extrapolated to future user interface and gameplay possibilities for these and other genres. Some of these have since been adopted by persistent worlds. For example, Second Life uses some of the gameplay investment and interface elements described in section 4 of the paper. In a University of Queensland study, game enjoyment was correlated with attributes such as immersion, social interaction, and the nature of the goals. These may be underlying factors in differentiating game genres. Statistical scaling techniques were used in a study presented at the 2007 Siggraph Video Game Symposium to convert subject ratings of game similarity into visual maps of game genres. The maps reproduced some of the commonly identified genres such as first-person shooters and god games. A Michigan State University study found that men have a higher preference for genres that require competition and three-dimensional navigation and manipulation than women do.

He is married with a daughter and works as a managing director of an advertising and marketing agency in Leicester and as a part-time BBC Sport summariser. He marked the start of his career with impressive try scoring feats (2 on debut and another in his second test) but was controversially dropped from the England side after his 3rd test in favour of Tony Underwood following the 10-9 loss to Wales. He did not feature regularly for the England side after that but played numerous games for Northampton Saints and was selected for the 1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand. However, injury cruelly struck on the Lions Tour and he was the first player sent home through injury when he dislocated his shoulder in a tackle in the first game against Northland. His seventh and final appearance for England came against France in the 1995 World Cup. His shoulder never properly healed enough to stand the demands of top class rugby and he retired from the game in 2001. Ian was noted throughout his career for being remarkably fit - in 1993 he finished top of the England Squad on the much-vaunted VO2 test.

He is credited with taking the club from third bottom of the Scottish League to being an established side in the Scottish top tier. He became the first manager of a British club to win a competitive game in Spain when United won home and away against F.C. Barcelona in the 1966-67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Playing career A native of West Lothian, Kerr enjoyed a lengthy playing career as a full-back, predominantly as a part-timer or amateur. = Armadale Thistle / Rangers = From the age of 15, Jerry played for his native Armadale Thistle. He joined Rangers at the age of 17 but played just one game for the Ibrox club. =Motherwell and Alloa Athletic= His senior playing career began at Armadale before he joined Motherwell and later Alloa Athletic. =St Bernard's= He next club was St Bernard's in 1937. He captained the Edinburgh side to the Scottish Cup semi-finals in his first season at the Gymnasium, where they eventually lost to fellow Second Division side East Fife in a second replay. =Dundee United= He became one of new Dundee United manager Bobby McKay's first signings during the close season of 1939 and again was made club captain but only four League matches of season 1939‚Äì40 were played before the competition was abandoned. Kerr was one of only three players who remained with United after the outbreak of war, and played as his team progressed to the final of the Emergency War Cup (effectively the Scottish Cup, but with relaxed registration rules due to the Second World War). He was, however, unlucky to sustain a shoulder injury in the semi-final which kept him out of the final against Rangers, at Hampden. =Rangers= Kerr spent two years with Rangers after the war before moving towards a coaching career. Management =Peebles Rovers and Berwick Rangers= It was in the field of football management where Kerr's true strengths began to emerge. His first post was as player/manager with the East of Scotland League club Peebles Rovers, followed by a spell at Berwick Rangers. =Alloa Athletic= Kerr was appointed manager of Alloa Athletic in 1955, a club where he had spent time as a player. He became known as having an eye for a good player, also having a theory that the bigger the club, the worse the talent-spotting. When at Alloa he assembled a partnership of inside forwards Dennis Gillespie (who he would later take to Tannadice) and John White. Two years later Kerr sold White to Falkirk. Tottenham Hotspur a year later spent ¬£20,000 to lure White to North London. =Dundee United= In 1959 United manager Andy McCall (their fifth in less than five years), resigned after leading the part-time club to third bottom place in Division Two. Jerry Kerr was the man given the task of reviving the club in April that year. Kerr's first policy upon joining United was his insistence that his players be full-time, a gamble that could have cost the club dearly. He also insisted that there had to be a properly constituted reserve side and an end to the previous policy of buying in over- the-hill First Division players. Ron Yeats' career took an upward turn from Kerr's appointment. Kerr regarded Yeats as so vital to the fortunes of the team he sought his release to play each Saturday from the military authorities while Yeats served his National Service. In Kerr's 1959‚Äì60 first full season in charge, St Johnstone finished as champions. United's challengers for the second promotion spot were Hamilton Academical and Queen of the South. Hamilton were beaten 5-1 at Tannadice with seven games to go before a crowd of over 11,000 putting Accies firmly in United's rear view. United went to Palmerston Park to play the Ivor Broadis inspired Queen of the South with three games to go. United returned home with a 4-4 draw to maintain their one- point advantage over QoS. Promotion was clinched with a last game of the season 1-0 home win against Berwick Rangers before a crowd of near 17,000.\\"Results for Dundee United for 1959-60\\" London Hearts This brought First Division football to Tannadice for the first time since they had been relegated in 1932. In the following 1960‚Äì61 season United retained their top division place. Other players to flourish like defensive giant Yeats were the forward pair Gillespie (whom Kerr had brought with him from Alloa Athletic) and Jim Irvine scoring 21 and 23 goals respectively. United finished a creditable ninth. Kerr was imaginative and inspired with some of his signings. With Hal Stewart of Morton, he was the first to see the possibility of tapping Scandinavia for cultured players at an affordable price. And by 1964, Lennart Wing, Finn D√∏ssing, Mogens Berg and √ñrjan Persson were Tannadice stalwarts. Kerr is also credited with another landmark moment in the club's history, as he led United into their first ever European tie in 1966. This produced a 4‚Äì1 aggregate victory over FC Barcelona in the Fairs Cup that included a 2‚Äì1 win at the Nou Camp. In November 1971 (then aged 59) he assumed the post of general manager. Jim McLean took over as manager of football matters to build upon Kerr's successful base over the following seasons. Kerr then left the club, with the minimum of publicity, at the end of season 1972‚Äì73. Kerr is remembered for taking United from third from the bottom in Scottish League Football to a secure place in the top division. More than thirty years later the Club recognised the huge contribution Jerry had made when they renamed the south stand the Jerry Kerr Stand. =Forfar Athletic= He later managed Forfar Athletic from 1974 to 1976 before retiring from football completely.

Blue amber has been found only in the Dominican Republic‚Äîespecially in the amber mines around the city of Santiago and, less commonly, in the eastern half of the country. In the modern age, it was discovered at about the same time as Dominican amber.Mart√≠nez, R. & Schlee, D. (1984): Die Dominikanischen Bernsteinminen der Nordkordillera, speziell auch aus der Sicht der Werkstaetten. ‚Äì Stuttgarter Beitr. Naturk., C, 18: 79-84; Stuttgart.  Causes of coloration  Vittorio Bellani and Enrico Giulotto at the University of Pavia, Italy, studied several amber specimens by means of optical absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, and time-resolved fluorescence measurements. The resulting spectral analysis revealed that the emission and excitation spectra were similar in shape to those of diluted solutions of anthracene, perylene, and tetracene, and suggest that the fluorescent hydrocarbon responsible for the blueness is most likely perylene. Fluorescence is the process where molecules absorb high energy light which excites electrons into higher energy molecular orbitals. As these electrons relax back into their ground states, the energy difference is released as a photon, therefore emitting light at a higher wavelength or lower energy than the originally absorbed light. Despite their findings, the presence of these aromatic hydrocarbons has not been confirmed in samples of blue amber. While all types of amber tested displayed a fluorescence, blue amber fluoresced with a greater intensity, even though the absorption extinction coefficient was larger for red and yellow amber. Polished blue amber under direct sunlight. Although there are several theories about the origin of Dominican blue amber, there is a great probability that it owes its existence to ingredients such as anthracene as a result of 'incomplete combustion' due to forest fires among the extinct species Hymenaea protera trees about 25 to 40 million years ago.George Poinar, Jr. and Roberta Poinar, 1999.

When held against the sun it will appear like ordinary amber, and under ultraviolet light it will glow a bright milky-blue.

Since then, the term \\"The Loft\\" has come to represent Mancuso's own version of a non-commercial party where no alcohol, food, nor beverages are sold. Mancuso's vision of a private party is similar to, and inspired by, the rent party and house party. Unlike conventional nightclubs or discotheques, attendance is by invitation only. In the late 1970s, Mancuso abandoned the generally accepted and expected practice of beatmatching, preferring to play songs in their entirety on his renowned audiophile-quality sound system, considered to be the best in New York, and among the best in the world, during the venue's heyday. Mancuso required that the music played had to be soulful, rhythmic, and impart words of hope, redemption, or pride. History When Mancuso threw his first informal house parties, the gay community (who comprised much of The Loft's attendee roster) was often harassed in the gay bars and dance clubs, so many gay men carried bail money with them to gay bars. But at The Loft and many other early, private discotheques, they could dance together without fear of police action thanks to Mancuso's underground, yet legal, business model. Vince Aletti described it \\"like going to party, completely mixed, racially and sexually, where there wasn't any sense of someone being more important than anyone else\\". Alex Rosner reiterated this: \\"It was probably about sixty percent black and seventy percent gay...There was a mix of sexual orientation, there was a mix of races, mix of economic groups. A real mix, where the common denominator was music.\\" The initial Loft was Mancuso's own home at 645-647 Broadway.NYT May 21, 1974 \\"Weekly Parties for 500 Chill Tenants\\"NYT June 2, 1974 ‚ÄúThe Loft's Owner Is Told To Vacate‚Äù The collapse of a neighboring hotel in 1974 forced a temporary closure and move to 99 Prince Street in Soho, in 1975. Vociferous community opposition ensued, and the party lay dormant for a year during the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs' longest administrative trial to date, based on their insistence that Mancuso required a \\"cabaret license\\". The department decreed in 1975 that he was free to host his parties as long as there were no sales of food or beverages. This decision set a new precedent that benefited the Paradise Garage and other private \\"clubs\\" in the process. The period also saw Mancuso's space serve as headquarters for the New York Record Pool, the very first record pool, which he founded with Vince Aletti and Steve D'Acquisto. Many of the disco era's leading disc jockeys, including Larry Levan, Nicky Siano,Tim Lawrence Articles and Frankie Knuckles were early Loft attendees. Their venues (the Paradise Garage, The Gallery, Chicago's Warehouse, and the exclusively gay The Saint) were influenced by The Loft. Nonetheless, Mancuso maintained his niche, breaking such unconventional records as Manu Dibango's \\"Soul Makossa\\" and the Steve Miller Band's \\"Macho City\\" at his weekly events. In 1984, after Mancuso's 99 Prince Street owner put the building up for sale, Mancuso purchased a building on 3rd Street, between Avenue B and Avenue C in Alphabet City. Not yet benefiting from gentrification, the new crime-and-drug ridden setting resulted in his losing \\"65 percent of [his] attendance\\". Around this time, DJ and promoter impresario Richard Vasquez began his influential and exclusive weekly parties, named \\"The Choice\\", at this location along with Joey Llanos. The party kept the spirit of the early Mancuso parties while embracing the early days of Deep House Music. In 1994, Mancuso relocated to a smaller space on nearby Avenue A and subsequently downsized further to another location on Avenue B. Since then, Mancuso continued to throw three to five Loft parties per year at an undisclosed location in the East Village, while organizing general admission Loft-style events in locales as disparate as Los Angeles, CA and Shibuya, Tokyo. Record company 1999 and 2000 saw the release of the defunct Nuphonic Records' David Mancuso presents The Loft anthologies on CD and vinyl, all of which are now highly collectible and hard to find.

Kate is a trans woman, one of the first transgender characters in comics, and remains one of the only transgender superheroines. The character was created by transgender science fiction writer Rachel Pollack. Rachel Pollack based the character's civilian name on two friends of hers, transgender writer and actress Kate Bornstein and the transsexual activist Chelsea Goodwin. Fictional character biography Kate gains her powers while working as a prostitute. One of her customers is Rebis, a radioactive intersex person; after Kate has sex with them, she discovers she can coagulate liquids and dissolve solids at will. She first tries out for the Justice League, but is rejected by them. She meets the Doom Patrol while battling a villain called the Codpiece, who has devices such as a gun, a drill, and a spring-loaded boxing glove built into a special codpiece he designed and built. Coagula dissolves the device. Early on Kate is identified as a lesbian, but as the series progresses it becomes clear she is bisexual. She begins a romance with Robotman. The name Coagula comes from the alchemical term \\"Solve et Coagula\\", meaning \\"dissolve and coagulate\\". A while after the Doom Patrol split, Kate and Cliff take teammate Dorothy Spinner on a camping trip with the intention of telling her she is adopted. However, after hearing this, Dorothy suffers a mental breakdown. This causes her to generate a powerful psychic explosion, killing Kate and supposedly killing Cliff. Following this, Dorothy falls into a coma.Revealed in Doom Patrol vol. 3 #9 Powers and abilities After having sexual contact with Rebis (Larry Trainor + Eleanor Poole), Coagula gained the power to turn solids into liquids, and to coagulate liquids into solid.

The definition of the term in the United States is regulated by federal law (Code of Federal Regulations, 24 CFR 3280): \\"Manufactured homes are built as dwelling units of at least in size with a permanent chassis to assure the initial and continued transportability of the home.\\" The requirement to have a wheeled chassis permanently attached differentiates \\"manufactured housing\\" from other types of prefabricated homes, such as modular homes. United States =Definition= According to the Manufactured Housing Institute‚Äôs National Communities Council (MHINCC), manufactured homes\\"What is a Manufactured Home?\\" Manufactured Housing Institute's National Communities Council, accessed 6 July 2011 > are homes built entirely in the factory under a federal building code > administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). > The Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (commonly > known as the HUD Code) went into effect June 15, 1976. Manufactured homes > may be single- or multi-section and are transported to the site and > installed. The MHINCC distinguishes among several types of factory-built housing: manufactured homes, modular homes, panelized homes, pre-cut homes, and mobile homes. From the same source, mobile home \\"is the term used for manufactured homes produced prior to June 15, 1976, when the HUD Code went into effect.\\" Despite the formal definition, mobile home and trailer are still common terms in the United States for this type of housing. =History= The original focus of this form of housing was its ability to relocate easily. Units were initially marketed primarily to people whose lifestyle required mobility. However, beginning in the 1950s, these homes began to be marketed primarily as an inexpensive form of housing designed to be set up and left in a location for long periods of time, or even permanently installed with a masonry foundation. Previously, units had been eight feet or less in width, but in 1956, the wide home was introduced. This helped solidify the line between mobile and house/travel trailers, since the smaller units could be moved simply with an automobile, but the larger, wider units required the services of a professional trucking company. In the 1960s and '70s, the homes became even longer and wider, making the mobility of the units more difficult. Today, when a factory-built home is moved to a location, it is usually kept there permanently. The mobility of the units has decreased considerably. The factory-built homes of the past developed a negative stereotype because of their lower cost and the tendency for their value to depreciate more quickly than site-built homes. The tendency of these homes to rapidly depreciate in resale value made using them as collateral for loans far riskier than traditional home loans. Loan terms were usually limited to less than the 30-year term typical of the general home-loan market, and interest rates were considerably higher. In other words, these home loans resembled motor vehicle loans far more than traditional home mortgages. They have been consistently linked to lower-income families, which has led to prejudice and zoning restrictions, which include limitations on the number and density of homes permitted on any given site, minimum size requirements, limitations on exterior colors and finishes, and foundation mandates. Many jurisdictions do not allow the placement of any additional factory-built homes, while others have strongly limited or forbidden all single-wide models, which tend to depreciate in value more rapidly than modern double-wide models. The derogatory concept of a \\"trailer park\\" is typically older single-wide homes occupying small, rented lots and remaining on wheels, even if the home stays in place for decades. =Modern manufactured homes= Modern homes, especially modular homes, belie this image and can be identical in appearance to site- built homes. Newer homes, particularly double-wides, tend to be built to much higher standards than their predecessors. This has led to a reduction in the rate of value depreciation of many used units. Although great strides have been made in terms of quality, manufactured homes do still struggle with construction problems. Author Wes Johnson has pointed out that the HUD code which governs manufactured homes desperately needs to be updated, quality control at manufacturing facilities are often lax, and set-up issues often compromise even a well-made manufactured home. Johnson states buyers need to be exceptionally cautious if they are entertaining the idea of purchasing any manufactured home by carefully checking it for defects before signing the contract and supervising the set-up process closely. These homes in the modern age are built to be beautiful and last longer than the typical old trailers. When FEMA studied the destruction wrought by Hurricane Andrew in Dade County Florida, they concluded that modular and masonry homes fared best compared to other construction. =High-performance manufactured housing= While manufactured homes are considered to be affordable housing, older models can be some of the most expensive in the nation to heat due to energy inefficiency. High-performance manufactured housing uses less energy and therefore increases life-cycle affordability by decreasing operating costs. High-performance housing is not only energy efficient, but also attractive, functional, water-efficient, resilient to wind, seismic forces, and moisture penetration, and has healthy indoor environmental quality. Achieving high- performance involves integrated, whole building design, involving many components, not one single technology. High‚Äìperformance manufactured housing should also include energy efficient appliances, such as Energy Star qualified appliances. Energy Star requires ample insulation: 2x6 walls: R21, roof: R40, floor: R33. =Difference from modular homes= Both types of homes - manufactured and modular - are commonly referred to as factory-built housing, but they are not identical. Modular homes are built to IRC code. Modular homes can be transported on flatbed trucks rather than being towed, and can lack axles and an automotive-type frame. However, some modular houses are towed behind a semi-truck or toter on a frame similar to that of a trailer. The house is usually in two pieces and is hauled by two separate trucks. Each frame has five or more axles, depending on the size of the house. Once the house has reached its location, the axles and the tongue of the frame are then removed, and the house is set on a concrete foundation by a large crane. Some modern modular homes, once fully assembled, are indistinguishable from site- built homes. In addition, modular homes: * must conform to the same local, state and regional building codes as homes built on-site; * are treated the same by banks as homes built on-site. They are easily refinanced, for example; * must be structurally approved by inspectors; * can be of any size, although the block sections from which they are assembled are uniformly sized;https://homenation.com/mobile-vs-modular/ Modular home vs Manufactured home =Difference from IRC codes homes (site built)= Manufactured homes have several standard requirements that are more stringent than International Residential Code homes. Fire Protection A National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) study from July 2011 shows that occurrence of fires is lower in manufactured housing and the injury rate is lower in manufactured housing. The justification behind the superior fire safety is due to the following higher standard requirements: * The HUD standard requires a flame spread of 25 or less in water heater and furnace compartments. * The HUD standard requires a flame spread of 50 or less on the wall behind the range. * The HUD standard requires a flame spread of 75 or less on the ceilings. * The HUD standard requires a flame spread of 25 or less to protect the bottoms and side of kitchen cabinets around the range. * The HUD standard requires additional protection of cabinets above the range. * The HUD standard requires trim larger than 6\\" to meet flame spread requirements. * The HUD standard requires smoke detectors in the general living area. * The HUD standard requires 2 exterior doors. * The HUD standard requires bedroom doors to be within 35 feet of an exterior door. =Bay Area= The San Francisco Bay Area, located in Northern California, is known for its high real estate prices, making manufactured housing an increasingly popular alternative to traditional real estate. It is mainly the value of the land that makes real estate in this area so expensive. As of May 2011, the median price of a home in Santa Clara was $498,000, while the most expensive manufactured home with all the premium features was only $249,000. This drastic price difference is due to the fact that manufactured homes are typically placed in communities where individuals do not own the land, but instead pay a monthly site fee. This enables a consumer, who could otherwise not afford to live in the Bay Area, the opportunity to own a new home in this location. There are various communities of manufactured homes in the Bay Area, the largest being Casa de Amigos, located in Sunnyvale, California.

They are not as common as in the US, but the industry is expected to grow as this method of construction becomes more accepted. Manufactured home parks refer to housing estates where the house owner rents the land instead of owning it. This is quite common in Queensland in both the form of tourist parks and over fifty estates. The term transportable homes tends to be used to refer to houses that are built on land that is owned by the house owner. Typically the homes are built in regional areas where the cost of organizing tradespeople and materials is higher than in the cities. In particular prefabricated homes have been popular in mining towns or other towns experiencing demand for new housing in excess of what can be handled by local builders. This method of construction is governed by state construction legislation and is subject to local council approval and homeowners' warranty or home warranty insurance. Construction process A manufactured home is built entirely inside a huge, climate-controlled factory by a team of craftsmen. The first step in the process is the flooring, which is built in sections, each attached to a permanent chassis with its own wheels and secured for transport upon the home‚Äôs completion. Depending on the size of the house and the floorplan‚Äôs layout, there may be two, three or even four sections. The flooring sections have heating, electrical and plumbing connections pre- installed before they are finished with laminate, tile or hardwood. Next, the walls are constructed on a flat level surface with insulation and interior Sheetrock before being lifted by crane into position and secured to the floor sections. The interior ceilings and roof struts are next, vapor sealed and secured to each section‚Äôs wall frame before being shingled. Then, the exterior siding is added, along with the installation of doors and windows. Finally, interior finishing, such as sealing the drywall, is completed, along with fixture installation and finishing the electrical and plumbing connections. The exposed portions of each section, where they will eventually be joined together, are wrapped in plastic to protect them for transport. With all the building site prep work completed, the building will be delivered by trucks towing the individual sections on their permanent chassis. The sections will be joined together securely, and all final plumbing and electrical connections are made before a decorative skirt or facade is applied to the bottom exterior of the house, hiding the chassis and finishing off the look of the home. Inside, paint and carpet are finished to design specifications, then the home is cleaned thoroughly.

In some apocryphal texts, such as the Testament of Levi and the Book of Jubilees, Levi's wife, Kehath's mother, is Milkah, a daughter of Aram.Jubilees 34:20Testament of Levi 11 Onomastics According to biblical scholars, the meaning of Kehath's name is unknown, though it may derive from an Aramaic word meaning obey.Cheyne and Black, Encyclopedia Biblica In the Testament of Levi, Kehath's birth when his father Levi was 35 years old was accompanied by a vision of Kehath \\"on high in the midst of all the congregation\\";Testament of Levi, 3:52 in Rutherford H. Platt Jr. edition (1926) in the vision, Kehath's name is given as meaning \\"the beginning of majesty and instruction\\" and prophesies his being raised above his siblings.Testament of Levi. The quote \\"beginning of majesty and instruction\\" is from chapter 3, verse 53 according to the numbering in Rutherford Platt's translation (1926) . It is numbered as XI, 7 (page 50) in the edition by R. H. Charles (1908) Genealogy In the Book of Exodus, Kehath has four sons, Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Amram marries Jochebed and sires Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. Although some Greek and Latin manuscripts of the Septuagint version of the Torah state that Jochebed was Kehath's cousin,Exodus 6:16-20, LXX the Hebrew Masoretic Text states that she was his sisterNew American Bible, footnote to Exodus 6:20 \\\\---that is, Amram's aunt--- and Jochebed's relationship to Levi is otherwise described unambiguously as his daughter in the Book of Numbers 26:59. According to Numbers, Kehath gained 8,600 descendants during the lifetime of his grandson. However these names were prominent clans, and not always direct linear descendants as expected in western genealogies. Theories Julius Wellhausen's documentary hypothesis asserts that the Torah was compiled in the fifth century BC from several independent, contradictory, hypothetical (nonextant) documents, including the Jahwist, Elohist, Deuteronomic, and priestly sources and the Book of Generations. Advocates of this hypothesis, such as Richard Elliott Friedman, attribute Levi's biblical genealogy to the \\"Book of Generations\\".Richard Elliott Friedman, Who Wrote The Bible?. Others attribute Moses's birth narrative, which also mentions Amram and Jochebed, to the earlier \\"Elohist source\\". According to this theory, the Levite genealogy is a myth to explain away the fact that four different groups claimed descent from Levi---the Gershonites, Kehathites, Merarites, and Aaronids. Since Aaron could not have been a brother to Gershon, Kehath, and Merari, he had to belong to the following generation. The hypothetical reconstruction of the \\"Elohist source\\" mentions only that both parents were Levites without identifying their names (). Some scholars suspect that the \\"Elohist source\\" attributes to Moses both matrilineal and patrilineal descent from Levites in order to enhance his religious credentials.

Visually, these creations are comparable to intricate 'pop-ups', indeed, some works are deliberately engineered to possess 'pop-up'-like properties. However, origamic architecture tends to be cut out of a single sheet of paper, whereas most pop- ups involve two or more. To create the three-dimensional image out of the two- dimensional surface requires skill akin to that of an architect. Origin The development of origamic architecture began with Professor Masahiro Chatani's (then a newly appointed professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology) experiments with designing original and unique greeting cards. Japanese culture encourages the giving and receiving of cards for various special occasions and holidays, particularly Japanese New Year, and according to his own account, Professor Chatani personally felt that greeting cards were a significant form of connection and communication between people. He worried that in today's fast-paced modern world, the emotional connections called up and created by the exchange of greeting cards would become scarce.http://www.japandesign.ne.jp/IAA/chatani/about.html (Japanese only) In the early 1980s, Professor Chatani began to experiment with cutting and folding paper to make unique and interesting pop-up cards. He used techniques of origami (Japanese paper folding) and kirigami (Japanese papercutting), as well as his experience in architectural design, to create intricate patterns which played with light and shadow.Chatani, Masahiro. Pop-Up Origamic Architecture. Tokyo: Ondorisha Publishers, 1985. Many of his creations are made of stark white paper which emphasizes the shadowing effects of the cuts and folds. In the preface to one of his books, he called the shadows of the three-dimensional cutouts created a \\"dreamy scene\\" that invited the viewer into a \\"fantasy world.\\" At first, Professor Chatani simply gave the cards to his friends and family. Over the next nearly thirty years, however, he published over fifty books on origamic architecture, many directed at children. He came to believe that origamic architecture could be a good way to teach architectural design and appreciation of architecture, as well as to inspire interest in mathematics, art, and design in young children. Professor Chatani also spent a good deal of time, even after his retirement, traveling to exhibit his work. He frequently collaborated on books and exhibits with Keiko Nakazawa and Takaaki Kihara. =Masahiro Chatani= Masahiro Chatani was a Japanese architect (certified, first class) and professor considered to be the creator of origamic architecture.http://baudandbui.free.fr/plier/chatani/chatani.html From its development until his death in 2008, he was widely acknowledged to be the world's foremost origamic architect. Masahiro Chatani was born in Hiroshima, Japan in 1934. He grew up in Tokyo, and graduated from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1956. He became an assistant professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1969 and an associated assistant professor at Washington University in 1977, and was promoted to full professorship at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1980. It was around this time that he created what is now known as \\"origamic architecture.\\" He became a professor emeritus fifteen years later, and continued to lecture at a number of institutions, including the Japan Architectural College, Hosei University, and the Shizuoka University of Art and Architecture. After his retirement from active professorship, he continued to travel around the world, giving exhibits, demonstrations, and seminars on architectural design and origamic architecture.http://www.japandesign.ne.jp/IAA/chatani/about.html ; http://www.neo-di.com/KAI/NY/NLE.html Professor Chatani died on November 19, 2008, at the age of 74, from complications from larynx cancer. Types of origamic architecture There are several different styles of origamic architecture. In one style, a folded paper is cut in such a way that when the paper is opened to form a 90-degree angle, a three-dimensional image can be created, similar to most pop-up books.http://www.maroon.dti.ne.jp/kihara/INDEX/indexEN.htm A second style requires attaching a cut-out form to a base sheet of paper with thread. Takaaki Kihara frequently uses another technique in which the three- dimensional structure is \\"punched out\\" of the flat card. Designs created with this technique allow the viewer to see the empty cutouts, which can create interesting shadowing effects. Kihara also points out that this style of origamic architecture is easier to store than the other 180-degree form, as the cut-out three-dimensional forms can be re-flattened with ease. Less commonly, some designs require opening the paper and folding it completely in the opposite direction, making a 360-degree angle. = Uses in Architectural Design = Origamic architecture has become a tool many architects use to visual the 2D as 3D in order to expand and explore on a design idea. There are ways of doing origamic architecture using CAD( Computer-Aided-Design). CAD uses laser cuts to speed the cutting process along allowing for precise forms to be made. AI design programs still are in development, architects have been searching for solutions to their design struggles. EPFL architects Hani Buri and Yves Weinand, researched ways on how to mass produce \\"complex folded plate structures using origami architecture. Through different folding techniques like the Yoshimura pattern (an inverted diamond pattern), Miura Ori pattern (a repetition of reverse folds resulting in a diamond pattern), and the Diagonal pattern (series of parallelograms folded at a diagonal) \\\\- all were very successful due to their Origami diamond and herringbone patterns. As a result Buri and Weinand were able to produce successful models and even a Chapel in Lausanne, Switzerland. Leading practitioners Although origamic architecture was developed and first gained popularity in Japan, it is today practiced in countries all over the world.http://www.neo- di.com/KAI/NY/NLE.html *Keiko Nakazawa (Japan)http://www.neo- di.com/KAI/english/profileE.html *Takaaki Kihara *Giovanni Russo (Italy) *Ingrid Siliakus (the Netherlands) *Maria Garrido (Spain) See also *Origami *Kirigami *Paper Folding *Papercutting *Parallelogram References External links *Elod Beregszaszi' website *Ingrid Siliakus' website *Giovanni Russo' website *Masahiro Chatani's biography in English *Masahiro Chatani's website (Japanese only) *The Origami Resource Center's Origamic Architecture page *Papyromania *Takaaki Kihara's Gallery of Origamic Architecture *Joyce Aysta's website *Luciana Mancosu' website (italian) *ANN Handicraft *Yee's Job website Category:Paper folding ","title":"Origamic architecture"},{"id":"2538903","text":"Firefox is an arcade game based on the 1982 Clint Eastwood movie of the same name.\\"Firefox Takes Off\\" from Atari employee newsletter (page 1) It was produced in 1984Atari Vax emails \\"And to my knowledge, Coin-op has yet to sacrifice quality to get an on-time delivery.

He finished the 2000 season with the Mets and also spent the season there. In 2001, he broke MLB's career pinch hits record, previously held by Manny Mota (150). Note, the 150-mark has also been surpassed by Mark Sweeney (175). The season proved successful for Harris. He batted .305 in 122 games with the Milwaukee Brewers at the age of 37, showing that he would still be able to play for several more years. He started the season with the Chicago Cubs, with whom he played 75 games before being released and signing with the Florida Marlins. He was on the Marlins' championship team in the 2003 World Series. Although he batted just .193 in the 2003 campaign, he re-signed for one year with the Marlins in . Although he had said that he would retire after the 2004 season, he re-signed for another year with the Marlins in and said that he would return for the season. However, the Marlins released him during spring training in 2006. Coaching career After his release, he became the infield coordinator for the Washington Nationals, and eventually, the hitting coach. He was fired by the Nationals on September 28, , after less than two seasons on the job. On October 24, 2008, Harris became the Los Angeles Dodgers minor league hitting instructor at Camelback Ranch, the team's Spring Training facility. In 2011, he was the hitting coach for the Great Lakes Loons. After serving as a coach for the Gulf Coast League Marlins, he became the assistant hitting coach of the Miami Marlins and later became the third base coach of the Miami Marlins. He was let go by the Marlins after the 2016 season. For the 2017 season, Harris returned to the Reds as a coach for their Arizona league affiliate.

A ram-air parachute has a tendency to open very rapidly. At high velocities, the opening shock from such a rapid deployment can cause damage to the canopy or injury to the jumper. The slider was developed as a way of mitigating this. During deployment, the slider slides down from the canopy to just above the risers. It is slowed by air resistance as it descends and reduces the rate at which the lines can spread and therefore the speed at which the canopy can open and inflate. The slider also deflects some of the rising air column away from the center of the canopy as it inflates. This also helps moderate the speed of opening. This invention solved the rapid deployment problem with ram-air designs. Sliders also reduce the chance of the lines twisting to cause a malfunction. In BASE jumping, when a rapid canopy deployment is desirable, the slider may be constructed of mesh, packed so that the slider is at the base of the lines and does not inhibit the opening (\\"slider down\\") instead of up by the canopy, or removed completely. Slider down and slider off both allow the canopy to open with no resistance and are identical in performance.http://www.basejumper.com/Articles/Gear/Sliders_673.html In 1971, Domina Jalbert's ram air parachute design was perfected and tested at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base in Vandalia, Ohio. Theodore Hulsizer, civilian prototype parachute manufacturer for the United States Air Force and NASA (1947-1973), made the first parafoil parachute that worked. While testing his prototype in the wind tunnel at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, USA, Theodore realized its drag was considerably stronger than any other parachute he had tested in his 25 years of experience. He believed others' attempts ripped to shreds, because of the drag. To slow the opening of the parafoil, Theodore ran the cords through rings he designed that were slid to the top while packing the parachute. As it opened, the rings had to slide down, slowing the opening. Theodore personally made the first full-size parafoil, which worked perfectly in its first drop. http://www.PrototypeParachutes.com  References  http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/skydiving4.htm http://www.skydivewestpoint.com/skydiving-information/Soft-Parachute- Deployments.aspx Category:Parachuting ","title":"Slider (parachuting)"},{"id":"2538965","text":"Juliusz Kossak, The Relief of Smolensk by Polish forces during the Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War (1605‚Äì18).

Work Kossak exhibited his work on Polish soil and abroad since 1854. His preferred medium was watercolour, both in smaller and larger formats. He was the precursor of a Polish school of battle-scene painting, with his main subject matter revolving around what was of great concern to Poles opposing the military occupation of their country. He was the author of over a dozen panoramic paintings depicting Polish cavalry in battle and on military actions against foreign invaders. Kossak produced also a series of portraits in oil for Polish noble families including Fredro, Gniewosz, Tyszkiewicz, Lipski and Morstin clan. His rustic and pastoral scenes included horse fairs, country weddings, winter hunting excursions, mythological scenes and horse stables. He also produces a series of illustrations of Polish epic literature such as Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz, novels of Henryk Sienkiewicz, works by Wincenty Pol, Jan Chryzostom Pasek and others.

For uni dimensional predictions, it is strictly equivalent to the mean squared error. The Brier score is applicable to tasks in which predictions must assign probabilities to a set of mutually exclusive discrete outcomes. The set of possible outcomes can be either binary or categorical in nature, and the probabilities assigned to this set of outcomes must sum to one (where each individual probability is in the range of 0 to 1). It was proposed by Glenn W. Brier in 1950. The Brier score can be thought of as a cost function. More precisely, across all items i\\\\in{1...N} in a set of N predictions, the Brier score measures the mean squared difference between: * The predicted probability assigned to the possible outcomes for item i * The actual outcome o_i Therefore, the lower the Brier score is for a set of predictions, the better the predictions are calibrated. Note that the Brier score, in its most common formulation, takes on a value between zero and one, since this is the square of the largest possible difference between a predicted probability (which must be between zero and one) and the actual outcome (which can take on values of only 0 or 1). In the original (1950) formulation of the Brier score, the range is double, from zero to two. The Brier score is appropriate for binary and categorical outcomes that can be structured as true or false, but it is inappropriate for ordinal variables which can take on three or more values.  Definition  The most common formulation of the Brier score is :BS = \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum\\\\limits _{t=1}^{N}(f_t- o_t)^2 \\\\,! in which f_t is the probability that was forecast, o_t the actual outcome of the event at instance t (0 if it does not happen and 1 if it does happen) and N is the number of forecasting instances. In effect, it is the mean squared error of the forecast. This formulation is mostly used for binary events (for example \\"rain\\" or \\"no rain\\"). The above equation is a proper scoring rule only for binary events; if a multi-category forecast is to be evaluated, then the original definition given by Brier below should be used. =Example= Suppose that one is forecasting the probability P that it will rain on a given day. Then the Brier score is calculated as follows: * If the forecast is 100% (P = 1) and it rains, then the Brier Score is 0, the best score achievable. * If the forecast is 100% and it does not rain, then the Brier Score is 1, the worst score achievable. * If the forecast is 70% (P = 0.70) and it rains, then the Brier Score is (0.70‚àí1)2 = 0.09. * In contrast, if the forecast is 70% (P = 0.70) and it does not rain, then the Brier Score is (0.70‚àí0)2 = 0.49. * Similarly, if the forecast is 30% (P = 0.30) and it rains, then the Brier Score is (0.30‚àí1)2 = 0.49. * If the forecast is 50% (P = 0.50), then the Brier score is (0.50‚àí1)2 = (0.50‚àí0)2 = 0.25, regardless of whether it rains. =Original definition by Brier= Although the above formulation is the most widely used, the original definition by Brier is applicable to multi-category forecasts as well as it remains a proper scoring rule, while the binary form (as used in the examples above) is only proper for binary events. For binary forecasts, the original formulation of Brier's \\"probability score\\" has twice the value of the score currently known as the Brier score. :BS = \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum\\\\limits _{t=1}^{N}\\\\sum\\\\limits _{i=1}^{R}(f_{ti}-o_{ti})^2 \\\\,! In which R is the number of possible classes in which the event can fall, and N the overall number of instances of all classes. For the case Rain / No rain, R=2, while for the forecast Cold / Normal / Warm, R=3. Decompositions There are several decompositions of the Brier score which provide a deeper insight on the behavior of a binary classifier. = 3-component decomposition = The Brier score can be decomposed into 3 additive components: Uncertainty, Reliability, and Resolution. (Murphy 1973) : BS=REL-RES+UNC Each of these components can be decomposed further according to the number of possible classes in which the event can fall. Abusing the equality sign: : BS=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum\\\\limits _{k=1}^{K}{n_{k}(\\\\mathbf{f_{k}}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{o}}_{\\\\mathbf{k}})}^{2}-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum\\\\limits _{k=1}^{K}{n_{k}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{o}_{k}}-\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{o}})}^{2}+\\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{o}}\\\\left({1-\\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{o}}}\\\\right) With \\\\textstyle N being the total number of forecasts issued, \\\\textstyle K the number of unique forecasts issued, \\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{o}}={\\\\sum_{t=1}^{N}}\\\\mathbf/N the observed climatological base rate for the event to occur, n_{k} the number of forecasts with the same probability category and \\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{o}}_{\\\\mathbf{k}} the observed frequency, given forecasts of probability \\\\mathbf{f_{k}}. The bold notation is in the above formula indicates vectors, which is another way of denoting the original definition of the score and decomposing it according to the number of possible classes in which the event can fall. For example, a 70% chance of rain and an occurrence of no rain are denoted as \\\\mathbf=(0.3,0.7) and \\\\mathbf=(1,0) respectively. Operations like the square and multiplication on these vectors are understood to be component wise. The Brier Score is then the sum of the resulting vector on the right hand side. Uncertainty The uncertainty term measures the inherent uncertainty in the outcomes of the event. For binary events, it is at a maximum when each outcome occurs 50% of the time, and is minimal (zero) if an outcome always occurs or never occurs. Reliability The reliability term measures how close the forecast probabilities are to the true probabilities, given that forecast. Reliability is defined in the contrary direction compared to English language. If the reliability is 0, the forecast is perfectly reliable. For example, if we group all forecast instances where 80% chance of rain was forecast, we get a perfect reliability only if it rained 4 out of 5 times after such a forecast was issued. Resolution The resolution term measures how much the conditional probabilities given the different forecasts differ from the climatic average. The higher this term is the better. In the worst case, when the climatic probability is always forecast, the resolution is zero. In the best case, when the conditional probabilities are zero and one, the resolution is equal to the uncertainty. = Two-component decomposition = An alternative (and related) decomposition generates two terms instead of three. : BS=CAL + REF : BS=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum\\\\limits _{k=1}^{K}{n_{k}(\\\\mathbf{f_{k}}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{o}}_{\\\\mathbf{k}})}^{2}+\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum\\\\limits _{k=1}^{K}{ n_{k}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{o}_{k}} (1 - \\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{o}_{k}} } ) ) The first term is known as calibration (and can be used as a measure of calibration, see statistical calibration), and is equal to reliability. The second term is known as refinement, and it is an aggregation of resolution and uncertainty, and is related to the area under the ROC Curve. The Brier Score, and the CAL + REF decomposition, can be represented graphically through the so-called Brier Curves, where the expected loss is shown for each operating condition. This makes the Brier Score a measure of aggregated performance under a uniform distribution of class asymmetries.  Shortcomings  The Brier score becomes inadequate for very rare (or very frequent) events, because it does not sufficiently discriminate between small changes in forecast that are significant for rare events. Wilks (2010) has found that \\"[Q]uite large sample sizes, i.e. n > 1000, are required for higher-skill forecasts of relatively rare events, whereas only quite modest sample sizes are needed for low-skill forecasts of common events.\\"  See also  *Forecast skill *Scoring rule  References  ;Notes ;Sources * J.

Construction Orders for Fames construction were issued by Admiralty in April 1756, in the months before the outbreak of the Seven Years' War against France. She was designed by naval architect William Bately, newly appointed as co-Surveyor of the Navy alongside his more senior colleague Sir Thomas Slade. It was Bately's first design for a vessel of this size, and borrowed heavily from Slade's specifications for the older 74-gun Dublin-class ships which were then under construction at England's Royal Dockyards. Bately's drawings also drew inspiration from the dimensions and sailing qualities of the King's yacht Royal Caroline.Winfield 2007, pp. 5859 It was the only vessel built to these specifications; all subsequent 74-gun vessels launched during the Seven Years' War were designed directly by Slade. There was little room available in the Royal Dockyards for the new vessel. Consequently, despite some Navy Board misgivings regarding quality and cost, contracts for her construction were issued to a private shipwright, Henry Bird of Rotherhithe, for ¬£17.2s per ton burthen and with an emphasis on completion and launch by May 1758. Fames keel was laid down 28 May 1756 but work proceeded slowly, with the vessel not finally ready for launch until 1 January 1759. As built Fame was comparable in size to Slade's Dublinclass vessels, being long with a keel, a beam of , and a hold depth of . Construction expenses were ¬£26,392.10s with an additional ¬£9,169.9s for fitting-out significantly less than costs for the majority of Dublinclass ships. Her designated complement was 550, comprising five commissioned officers a captain and four lieutenants overseeing 80 warrant and petty officers, 304 naval ratings, 99 Marines and 62 servants and other ranks.Rodger 1986, pp.348351 Naval career In 1762, while in company with , she captured the French 10-gun ship Ecureuil. On 20 January 1768, she was driven from her moorings at Plymouth, Devon onto St. Nicholas Island and was severely damaged. She collided with the Irish ships Freemason and Valentine. The former was also driven ashore on St. Nicholas Island, the latter sank in the Hamoaze. HMS Fame was refloated on 5 February and taken in to Plymouth for repairs. In 1778, commanded by Captain Stephen Colby, she proceeded to the North American station in a fleet of 14 ships commanded by Vice-Admiral the Hon. John Byron with his flag in . On 6 July 1779, commanded by Captain John Butchart, Fame took part in the Battle of Grenada against the French. The French fleet, under Admiral D‚ÄôEstaing, consisted of 25 ships of the line and several frigates. The British fleet, under Vice-Admiral Byron, had 21 ships of the line and 1 frigate. The French were anchored off Georgetown on the south- west of the island, and the English approached during the night. D‚ÄôEstaing weighed at 4 am and Byron chased. The British ships attacked in utter disorder and confusion. Fame and three other ships got separated from the main body, and were very badly mauled. The French lost no ships and eventually hauled off. The British lost 183 killed and 346 wounded. Fame lost 4 killed and 9 wounded. The French lost 190 killed and 759 wounded. This action reflected no credit on either side. In 1782, commanded by Captain Robert Barbor, she was one of a fleet of 36 ships of the line under Admiral Sir George Rodney, who flew his flag in . They met in the West Indies between Dominica and Guadeloupe a French fleet of 33 ships of the line commanded by Vice-Admiral Comte de Grasse with his flag in Ville de Paris. The fighting was spread over several days, and the French were defeated in the Battle of the Saintes. George Vancouver served as lieutenant on this Fame under Captain Robert Barbor during this engagement. Vancouver later went on captain his own ship, , on a voyage of discovery to the Pacific Northwest in search of the Northwest passage. In December 1799, Fame was renamed Guilford and fitted as a prison ship. She was eventually sold out of the service in 1814.Ships of the Old Navy, Fame.

Known as Edeta in ancient Iberian times, it is the musical capital of the region. On October 30 2019, Ll√≠ria was declared a Creative City in the category of Music by the UNESCO. Location Ll√≠ria is the capital of the area known as Camp de T√∫ria in the province of Valencia. It is approximately north-west of the city of Valencia. It sits at an altitude of 164m (530'). The population in 2006 totalled approximately 21,500. The traditional economy is based on agriculture, but industries such as textiles, construction materials, plastics, and furniture are becoming increasingly important. The city is at the end of the Metrovalencia train system. Construction of a new general hospital in Ll√≠ria began in 2007 and finished in 2015. Due to the severe financial crisis, the building of the hospital took much longer than initially expected. The local Fiestas are Romer√≠a of San Vicente Ferrer (29 April), and Saint Michael (29 September). History and architecture =Pre-Roman Age= Detail of The Twelve Labours mosaic (3rd century). Under Ll√≠ria lie the ruins of what was one of the most important Iberian cities in Spain. The city was then known as Edeta and it was the administrative centre of Edetania, an extensive territory between the rivers J√∫car / X√∫quer and / Riu Pal√†ncia. Edeta was built on a hilltop known as Sant Miquel, which overlooks the modern city. The city was moved downhill to its current location by Quintus Sertorius after Roman troops destroyed the town in 76 BC. =Roman Age= Baroque church (17th century). Esgl√©sia de la Sang. Under the Romans, Ll√≠ria was as important as Valencia or Sagunt. The town is very rich in Roman finds, including a large Roman leisure centre with a temple, shops, pools, and hot baths. Recent archaeological excavations have uncovered one of Spain's largest-ever caches of buried coins. Popularly known as the Treasure of Carrer Duc de Ll√≠ria, it totals some 6,000 silver denarii minted in the first and third centuries. Another archaeological find was a mosaic of The Twelve Labours of Hercules, which was excavated from a Domus Romana (Roman home) at Can Porcar or Casa de Porcar (Porcar House) in Ll√≠ria. It is currently displayed at the National Archaeological Museum of Spain (in Madrid). Additionally, Ll√≠ria's own archaeological museum contains imagery from its original location including details of each of the labors along with other Roman artifacts from the town. =Mediaeval Period= The first church in Ll√≠ria was built in 1238 by King James I of Aragon, after his victory over the Moors and the conquest of the Valencian region. The Church of the Blood (esgl√©sia de la Sang) was built on the site of a mosque and is a typical example of Valencian Gothic architecture with Roman and Valencian influences. Some remains of the original mosque can still be seen. In 1919 the church was gazetted as a National Monument and was the first religious monument in the Valencian Community to receive this distinction. The church was recently restored and opened to the public. Climate The climate is Mediterranean, but with slight continental influence due to the inland location with occasional cool nights in winter, snow is a very rare phenomenon. The average temperature is between 10¬∞/11¬∞ C (50¬∞/52¬∞ F) in January and 26¬∞/29 ¬∞C (79¬∞/84 ¬∞F) in July and August. Rainfall is very irregular but with heavy showers common in September and October. Population The city has about 21,500 residents (2006) of which some 16,500 live in the city centre and 5,000 live in surrounding residential estates. Ll√≠ria and the surrounding area has one of fastest rates of population growth in the entire nation. Utility services are struggling to keep up with largely unplanned growth. Sedesa SA has been given approval to construct a golf course with a hotel and luxury housing on a site some three kilometres to the north-east of the city. Work on the development was expected to begin in 2007, but now seem to have been suspended following the economic downturn. The largest immigrant communities are from Morocco (434), Romania (344) and the United Kingdom (323). Festivals * Holy Week in Ll√≠ria: (Valencian: Setmana Santa de Ll√≠ria, ) is one of the most important traditional events in the city and also one of the most ancient traditional Holy Week celebrations in the Region of Valencia. It is celebrated between Friday of Sorrows and Resurrection Sunday, including also Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday (Holy Thursday), Good Friday, and Holy Saturday. Ll√≠ria has elaborate processions during Holy Week, a tradition that dates from medieval times. Like in other regions of Spain, its Holy Week is notable for featuring the procession of \\"im√°genes\\", lifelike wood or plaster sculptures of individual scenes of the events that happened between Jesus' arrest and his burial, or images of the Virgin Mary showing grief for the torture and killing of her son. * Saint Michael's Festival or Feast Day: on September, the 29th * Saint Vincent's Festival or Feast Day: Next Monday after Easter * Festival of the Immaculate Conception: end of August * Festival of Our Lady of the Remedy: mid-September * Taurine Week: First week of October Music Several thousand of Ll√≠ria's residents play musical instruments and the city is well known for its two intensely rival bands (wind orchestras). The first band, the \\"Banda Primitiva\\", was formed by a Franciscan friar Antoni Albarrac√≠n Engu√≠danos in 1838 and the subsequent band divided in 1903 to form the rival Uni√≥ Musical. The Conservatory of Lliria is a public center created by the city council on the 90's. Language Both Spanish and Valencian are spoken in the town; however, the number speaking Valencian in their homes is steadily decreasing as the town is slowly absorbed into the Spanish-speaking conurbation of Valencia.

Fairthorpe Ltd was founded by Air Vice Marshal Donald Bennett. Fairthorpe Ltd remains listed (as does Technical Exponents Ltd) at Denham Green Lane (as at 2007), but Fairthorpe does not trade. 1962 Fairthorpe Electron Minor British Sports Car Atom and Atomota The first cars were lightweight two-seat models powered by motorcycle engines and with glassfibre bodies. The 1954 Atom was powered by a rear-mounted, two-stroke, air-cooled motor cycle engine driving the rear wheels through a three-speed Albion motor cycle gearbox and chain to the back axle. A choice of 250 cc or 350 cc BSA single cylinder and 322 cc Anzani twin-cylinder engines was offered. The body was mounted on a backbone chassis and had all independent suspension by coil springs and hydraulic brakes. 44 were made. The Atomota replaced the Atom in 1957 and was a complete re-design with front-mounted engine and new chassis. The engine was a twin cylinder, 646 cc BSA overhead-valve unit from the BSA Golden Flash model. It was coupled to a Standard 10 gearbox and drove the rear wheels via a propeller shaft and hypoid bevel gear. The suspension used coil springs all round with trailing wishbones at the rear. The number made is uncertain and the last car seems to have been made in 1960. Electron The 1957 Fairthorpe Electron Minor thumb In 1956 a new larger car, the open 2-seat Electron appeared using a 1098 cc overhead-cam Coventry Climax engine. The front suspension was independent using coil springs and drum brakes were used all round. The engine was expensive for the company to buy resulting in a high price of ¬£1050 (complete) or ¬£734 (kit); only around 20-30 are thought to have been made. A reduced price version the Electron Minor followed in 1957 using the Standard SC engine, transmission and rear axle from the Standard Ten. In 1963 the car received a larger version of the SC engine from the Triumph Spitfire and front disc brakes came from the same source in 1966. A hardtop was available as an option. With various specification changes the cars went from a Mark I to a Mark VI which had a Triumph GT6 chassis. It was the mainstay of production until 1973 with about 700 being built. There was also a closed 2+2 version with Triumph Herald mechanicals called the Electrina but only about 20 were produced. The cars were available fully assembled or in kit form. Production peaked at about 20 cars a month. Zeta The Zeta was introduced in 1959, powered by a modified six-cylinder Ford Zephyr engine of 2553 cc. It was offered in a choice of three stages of tune, with up to six carburettors and a BRM cylinder head, priced at ¬£1,198, ¬£1,281 and ¬£1,407 respectively; the basic kit was available for ¬£740. Very few, probably five, were made. Rockette A new version of the Zeta, the Rockette, was introduced in 1962. Sporting a slightly modified glass-fibre body shell and using a Triumph Vitesse 1600 cc engine and Triumph independent front suspension. It was priced at ¬£997, or ¬£625 in kit form. Approximately 25 were made up to 1967. TX In 1967 Donald Bennett's son Torix joined the company and a new car the TX-GT coup√© based on a Triumph GT6 chassis but with transverse rod independent rear suspension was announced. The engine was the 1998 cc unit also from the GT6. By this time the market for hand-built small production cars was declining and the last model, the TX-S was a modified TX- GT with a variety of engines and the choice of the standard GT6 rear suspension. It could also be had as the TX-SS with Triumph fuel-injected engines. Only about 30 of the TX cars were made. Another car, the TX Tripper, was produced by Torix's company, Technical Exponents, which shared premises with Fairthorpe. Looking like a psychedelic cross between a beach buggy and a sports car it was marketed as a TX and offered with either the Triumph chassis or a TX designed chassis. Triumph engines powered its various models: 1300, 2000, and 2500. About 20 were made.

The entry/exit doors can be seen below the \\"female\\" sponson. The \\"Female\\" tank was a variation of the British heavy tank deployed during the First World War. It carried multiple machine guns instead of the mix of machine guns and cannons mounted on the \\"male\\" tank. Lieutenant-Colonel Ernest Swinton, who played a part in the development of the first British tank and who was co-creator of the term \\"tank\\" (originally a code word), is credited with inventing these gender-related terms, thinking that the best tank tactics would have the two types operating in consort. The prototype, nicknamed \\"Mother\\", and the first production models of what would become referred to as the Mark I were designed to carry two six- pounder guns and three machine-guns. Swinton expressed the fear that tanks armed in such a way might be unable to protect themselves from attacks by large numbers of enemy infantry. In April 1916, it was therefore decided that half of the 150 tanks on order should be fitted with machine guns in place of the six-pounders. A new sponson was designed so that the tank could carry two Vickers machine guns, with their cooling jackets protected by armoured sleeves, on each side of the hull. Swinton's idea was that tanks should operate in pairs: a \\"destroyer\\" (Swinton's original proposed name was \\"Machine Gun Destroyer\\") and a \\"consort\\" or \\"man-killing\\" tank, so that the two gave mutual protection. He stated that he then assigned the names \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" respectively. The designation \\"male\\" applied to those armed with six- pounder guns, whereas the \\"female\\" was the tank equipped only with machine guns. A consequence of these designations was that the prototype Mother was considered a \\"male\\" tank. The design of the female sponson allowed only a very small door, which made escape from the vehicle extremely difficult. From the Mark II onwards, a new design was introduced that was smaller, incorporated Lewis or Hotchkiss guns, and allowed for much larger doors. Both male and female tanks took part in the first tank action, on September 15, 1916, at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, part of the Somme Offensive on September 15, 1916. In 1918 it was decided that tanks should be 'hermaphrodite', simultaneously male and female, carrying both heavy armament and lighter machine guns. For the World War I tanks, this was achieved by fitting them with one sponson of each type. A mixed ability armament of the heavy gun and multiple machine guns also became common practice on turreted designs, without sponsons. This has become the standard model for tank designs since World War I and since then the terms \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" have been disused. The basic idea underlying the concept of female tanks was widely used in design of light tanks and the first British infantry tanks in the years leading to World War II. Some armour of the World War II period, such as the German Ferdinand tank destroyer, were exclusively 'male', having only their heavy gun. These were found to be susceptible to infantry attack and so a defensive machine gun was added in the improved version, the Elefant.

It is the capital of the district of Ried im Innkreis, and it serves as the administrative centre for the Innviertel region. Geography Ried is situated in a hollow of the Alpine foothills, to the north of the Hausruck Forest (Hausruckwald). The name of the city is derived from the Middle High German \\"Riet\\" (also: Rieth, Reet, Rohr, and the like), which denotes the reed which grows along the shores of swamps. Ried im Innkreis is above sea level. It measures from the North to the South and from the East to the West and it is 6.7 km¬≤ (2.6 sq mi) in area. =Climate= =Town structure= Ried consists of a city core, composed of several spatially separated squares (e.g. Hauptplatz, Stelzhamerplatz, Kirchenplatz, Ro√ümarkt, Marktplatz, and Hoher Markt), as well as a few other quarters. Most of them have a long history of their own. Others were designed as new development areas and then obtained their own name, but often have no distinct boundaries. In particular, these areas belong to the city core: * Bad Ried * Hopfenberg * Kapuzinerberg * Kleinried * Kreuzbergsiedlung * Lughofergr√ºnde * Riedberg * Schlo√überg * St. Anna * St√∂cklgras * Wegleiten =Neighbouring municipalities= The following municipalities are adjacent to Ried. They are listed in clockwise direction, starting from the South: Neuhofen im Innkreis, Mehrnbach, Aurolzm√ºnster, Tumeltsham and Hohenzell. Population History =Middle ages= Ried was first mentioned on 13 November 1136, as a castle of the Bavarian sovereign with the seat of the noble house of Ried. Already in 1180, the townsmen of Ried were first mentioned in records, indicating a settlement near the castle. Legend has it that in 1191, Dietmar der Anhanger - a miller's son - obtained the market town of Ried as a fiefdom from Frederick I. (Barbarossa). Allegedly, Dietmar boosted the morale of the troops during the crusade: When the enemy had overthrown the flag of the army in Iconium, Dietmar took off his boot and put it onto a lance; under that sign, the crusaders took new courage and managed to conquer the city. The peasants' boot of this legend is now part of the city's coat of arms. The line of the lords of Ried ended around 1200 and the Bavarian dukes took over the area. Ried was situated only one and a half hours by foot from the Austrian border at the Geiersberg, and this vicinity proved again and again to be disastrous to the market town of Ried. In 1266, the Veste Ried was conquered by Ottokar II. P≈ôemysl, and it was again conquered on 24 September 1364 by Rudolf IV. der Stifter and destroyed. The First Treaty of Ried, negotiated in 1379, halted these border conflicts for the time being. In 1435, Ried obtained its own coat of arms from Duke Henry XVI of Bavaria. =Modern times= During the Reformation, several reports of ecclesiastic visitations verify the influence of the Reformation. But by 1580, the Counter-Reformation had been completed, which led many to emigrate. During the German Peasants' War, Ried was the asylum and headquarters of the Bavarian war commissioner. In 1649, a plague epidemic reached the city and took 236 lives. In the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1714) and in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1745), the border conflicts between Austria and Bavaria resurfaced. After the War of the Bavarian Succession, the Innviertel - including Ried - was ceded to Austria in the Treaty of Teschen 1779. During the Napoleonic Wars, it was temporarily returned to Bavaria in 1810. Napoleon spent the night in Ried twice and narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on 2 May 1809. With the Treaty of Ried, Bavaria changed sides on 8 October 1813 and joined the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon. After the Treaty of Munich in 1816, Ried finally became Austrian. As the largest market town of Austria at that time, Ried was granted its town charter by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in 1857. The \\"Gewerbliche Ausstellungsfest\\" (Commercial Exhibition Festival), held for the first time in 1867, formed the foundation for Ried's later position as a centre for exhibitions and trade fairs. =Contemporary history= On 12 March 1938 - the day of the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany - units of the German Wehrmacht marched into Ried; Hitler passed through the city on his way to Linz. At the end of World War II on 3 May 1945, American troops marched in and the city became part of the American occupation area in occupied Austria. The American military administration built a camp for members of the German military taken as prisoners of war. Besides the prisoner of war camp, a Displaced persons camp was also built. This camp was led by a member of the UNRRA and had the number 701A. Politics =Municipal council= Since the local elections in 2003, the municipal council has had 37 members, whose term of office is six years. Since the local elections in 2015, the seats are distributed among the political parties as follows: *√ñVP 15 *SP√ñ 7 *FP√ñ 10 *GR√úNE 4 *NEOS 1 =Mayor= Since 1781, Ried has been governed by a mayor and a municipal council. Since 1997, the mayor has been directly elected by the eligible voters for a term of four years, at the same time as the municipal council. The mayor is the chairman of the council. His deputy is the first councillor, the vice-mayor. Since 1994, the mayor of Ried im Innkreis has been Albert Ortig.

The coat of arms is divided into four parts: The upper quarter shows the double eagle and signifies the affiliation to Austria. The lower quarter contains the \\"Bavarian Wecken\\" - white-blue rhombuses - and indicates that the town originally belonged to Bavaria. In the left quarter is the laced boot, which was also on the older coat of arms and refers to the founding legend of the city. The tendrils in the right quarter were also in the original coat of arms and refer to the importance of the city as a centre of brewing. =Twin city= Since 1974, the Bavarian city of Landshut has been the twin city of Ried. Economy and infrastructure =Transport= Railway :The city of Ried is a crosspoint of the railway lines from Braunau to Wels and Linz, and from Sch√§rding to Attnang-Puchheim. The line from Vienna to Ried via Linz travels at one-hour intervals. Highways :Via the exits Ried/Tumeltsham and Ried/Haag, the city is connected to the motorway A8. Moreover, Ried is well connected to the federal highway network. There are connections to the East and to the West using the B141 and to the North and to the South via the B143. Air traffic :The international airport of Linz can be reached within 40 minutes by car. Buses :There are several \\"citybus\\" lines providing public transportation in the city. =Public facilities= Ried has a tax office, a regional court, and a district court. Furthermore, the district authority is based in the city. Since 1846, Ried has also had a hospital of regional importance. =Educational institutions = The development to a city of schools started with the construction of the high school in 1872. Today the city has two high schools, the Bundes Oberstufenrealgymnasium in the Dr. Thomas Senn-street and the Bundesgymnasium und Bundesrealgymnasium in the Beethovenstra√üe, three elementary schools, one alternative school (Bildungswerkstatt Schmetterlingsschule und Privatkindergarten), two public secondary schools, one private secondary school (Franziskanerinnen), and one polytechnic institute. The district capital is the seat of the school authority of the vocational schools (one for commercial skilled trades and the second for mercantile skilled trades), the Federal Commercial Academy, the Federal Commercial School, the College for Occupation in Service Industries Management, and the Higher Technical School for Engineering. In Ried, there is also a State Music School and the College for Kindergarten Pedagogics with its training kindergarten. A gymnastics school (Jahnturnhalle) of the Austrian Gymnastics Association (√ñsterreichische Turnerbunde, √ñTB) is also in Ried. =City of trade fairs = Since 1867, Ried has periodically held trade fairs of several days' duration. The significance and popularity of these exhibitions is reflected by the number of visitors. One quarter of the visitors come from Bavaria, but there are also many visitors from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. =Media= Weekly journals of Ried are the \\"Rieder Rundschau\\", the \\"Tips Ried-Sch√§rding\\" (), the (Ober√∂sterreichische Nachrichten, ), and the \\"Rieder Magazin\\" (). Since 2005 the TV channel \\"Ried TV\\" broadcasts local reports via an optical fiber network and via the internet. =Local companies= In the industrial sector, Ried is home to the world-famous ski factory, Fischer, FACC (Fischer Advanced Composites Components AG), which builds parts for aeroplanes, Team 7 producing organic furniture, and the company Wintersteiger, a specialist in high-technology plant construction and engineering. Ried was previously home to two breweries, keeping up the long history of beers in the Innviertel. The Kellerbrauerei was the oldest private brewery in Austria, founded in 1446, but ceased trading in 2013. The Riederbrauerei, founded in 1536, continues to produce beer and soft drinks to this day. Culture =Schwanthaler family= The roots of the Schwanthaler family of sculptors are in Ried. In 1632, Hans Schwabenthaler, later Schwanthaler, came to Ried, and the family's factory was there until 1838. His son, Thomas Schwanthaler, made the high altar and the sculpture of the Group on the Mount of Olives in the town church of Ried. Several sculptures of the family are preserved in many churches of Upper Austria and in the Innviertler Volkskundehaus (folklore museum). =Churches and monasteries= * Stadtpfarrkirche (town church) * Altkatholische Christuskirche (Old Catholic Christ Church) * Dreifaltigkeitskirche Riedberg (Trinity Church Riedberg) * Kapuzinerkirche (Capuchin Church) * Methodistenkirche (Methodist Church) * Neuapostolischekirche (New Apostolic Church) * Kapuzinerkloster (Capuchin Monastery) * Redemptoristinnenkloster (Redemptorist Convent) St. Anna Sports =SV Ried= Since the 1990s, Ried's football (soccer) club, SV Ried, has seen continuous success at the national level.

The name means 'forest' in the Wapishana language, a reference to the rich diversity of wildlife found there. The Eastern Kanuku Mountains and the Western Kanuku Mountains are separated by the Rupununi River. In 2011, the mountains were designated National Protected Area. History The lowland forests sustain 53% of all the known bird species in Guyana, and about 70% of all mammals found in Guyana, live in the Kanuku Mountains. Prominent species include the Giant otter, the Harpy eagle and the Arapaima. The highest peak of the Kanuku Mountains rises to 1,067 metres while the savannah area varies between 120 and 150 metres. In 2010, concern for the fate of the wildlife of the Kanuku Mountains was raised by the completion of the Takutu River Bridge and matching road system linking coastal Guyana with the interior and the Brazilian frontier. The road passes close to the Kanukus and is a potential source of unsustainable resource exploitation. In 2011, the mainly uninhabited area was protected, and designated a National Protected Area.

It is ten miles (16 km) north of Omagh in the valley of the Owenkillew river, overlooked by the Sperrins. It had a population of 360 at the 2001 Census. History In the 1840s Gortin was in the barony of Strabane. Its 410 inhabitants lived in 81 houses indifferently built and so placed as to form one irregular street. A writer at the time described the surrounding scenery, though bold, as \\"generally destitute of beauty from the want of wood, which is found only at Beltrim, a residence surrounded by young and thriving plantations\\". A court baron for the manor of Eliston, in which debts to the amount of 40 shillings was recoverable was held on the first Tuesday of each month and petty sessions were held once a month. The fair was held on the first Wednesday of each month and a pleasure fair was held each Easter Monday. Gortin, as well as a large area of country surrounding the village and is called Beltrim Castle, was the residence of the Hamilton (later Cole-Hamilton) family. The present castle is a modern building and the only part of the original castle which remains standing is a gable wall which at present no part of the modern building. The landlord built two Protestant churches on the estate, which was so large that the landlord was able to ride around it on horseback in a day. He was a keen sportsman and preserved the game. It was well known that if a tenant on the estate possessed a dog which could and did kill a hare and the story went to the landlord's ears, the tenant got orders to have the dog destroyed at once, and if the tenant was not prepared to do so he got \\"notice to quit\\". There was a bailiff kept on the estate whose principal duty was the control of the bog for turf cutting, who as well as his other duties, kept an eye on the progress of the tenantry and if anyone of them reclaimed any land or otherwise improved his holdings, so that the tenant was able to produce a couple of extra stacks of oats, his rent was immediately increased. The landlord served on the Grand jury, was a Magistrate, and Chairman of the local petty sessions, Chairman of the local board of guardians, who supervised the local workhouse and was always able to \\"rule the roost\\" and everyone else connected with these bodies were merely \\"yes\\" men. Gortin Roman Catholic church St. Patrick's Church of Ireland, Gortin The Ulster Bank in Gortin =Workhouse= The workhouse was built in 1841 at a cost of 2,689 pounds (the site cost another 200 pounds) to accommodate 200 paupers. It consisted of a main building about 200 yards in length and three stories high, together with a general hospital and a fever hospital as well as outhouses and stores etc. It is no longer in existence nor is the village distillery which was in operation then. There was also a police station: a parish church (it was in a dilapidated state and was about to be rebuilt); a parochial school, and a dispensary. The fever hospital still stands and is now the Manse or residence of the Presbyterian minister. There is a graveyard at the southern end or gable of it containing 33 graves of people who died in it, or in the central hospital or in the workhouse. In the famine years porridge was distributed at the workhouse to any person who asked for it provided they had a utensil to carry it away. There was also seed potatoes and oats and grass seed distributed, and a fee was charged. When the end to these places came, the remaining inmates were transferred to Omagh, and the workhouse and other buildings were sold. The Presbyterian Church bought the fever hospital and grounds, to be converted into a residence for their minister; and the Catholic Church bought the workhouse and grounds; and a new church and parochial house has been built on the foundations of it. While all the knocking down and leveling of the site was taking place the Parish Priest had a home fitted up for himself, it was part of the workhouse. The Minister had about the same time moved into his and some strangers were told one day at that time, that religion was in a very bad way about Gortin at present, for the Presbyterian minister was in the fever hospital and the Parish Priest was in the workhouse. =Economy= There was a Tannery about 100 years ago, and hides and skins were tanned from a substance obtained from the bark of oak trees. The oak bark was steeped in pits, built of stone and lime, and are still traceable in a yard in the village. The leather made here was used for making harness for horses as well as boots and shoes, which were made locally. There was a company of Imperial yeomanry stationed here about 150 years ago, whose principle duty seemed to be of searching for illicit spirits or poteen. The yeomanry were supplied with a metal badge worn on their uniform about the same size as the badge worn by taxi drivers and had embossed on it the words, \\"Gortin Imperial Yeomanry\\". The which was used as their barracks has been rebuilt. It was the first house in Gortin to have stairs and two floors. There was a brewery here at one time. It has been closed for about 100 years and a story still exists that an Excise officer from Omagh paid a visit to it once and he was never seen afterwards. There were two bakeries in Gortin at one time and the owner of one of them was in the habit of hitching up of two horses to the same number of carts and going to Dublin for two loads of flour. Each owner of the bakeries had a horse and bread cart delivering bread over the country. There was also a saw mill driven by a steam engine with the assistance of a windmill which also supplied power to a mill, for grinding Indian corn into meal and crushing oats, and for printing. There was an ordinary corn mill for grinding oats into meal. A stream of water or burn which runs through the village supplied the brewery with water as well as the saw mill and the two other mills. There was no other power at the time. These mills have been closed for about 100 years and are now derelict. Up to about 80 years ago, a pound existed on the outskirts of the village. This was a fenced enclosure where cattle and sheep which were found trespassing and in some cases destroying crops could be impounded and held until released by the owner on payment of a fee to the pound keeper for every day or part of a day on which the animals were held. There was a licence issued to the pound keeper otherwise he could not charge a fee for the detention of the animals, hence the saying 'your cow is in the pound.' Two trades have disappeared from the village during the past 70 years. One of them was a nailer, who made all sizes of nails from iron, called mailrod. The nails were not coated with any substance, the only tools used were a hammer and tongs, an anvil and a chisel. The other trade was a cooper, who made atts for holding butter and pails, tubs and barrels. The articles were all made to order.

His paintings were mainly genre works.  Biography  He was born in Amsterdam, the youngest son of immigrants from Wallonia. His parents, Jacques Boursse and Anna des Forest, married in 1618 in Amsterdam. We know nothing more about the education of Esaias Boursse, other than the fact that he travelled to Italy in about 1650 to study the great Renaissance examples. No reminders of those examples is to be found in his work. In the past art historians have tried to place him among Rembrandt's pupils. There is no objective evidence at all to prove this though. Maybe this opinion has been inspired by the fact that the painters were neighbours in the Sint Antoniebreestraat in Amsterdam (nowadays called Jodenbreestraat, still housing the Rembrandt House Museum). Boursse's financial position will not have been good, since in 1661 he sailed with the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie, on the ship Amersfoort. It travelled to Ceylon (nowadays called Sri Lanka). Boursse drew the inhabitants, landscapes and city views, which have been preserved in an album which can be found in the print room of the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. In 1663, the painter was back in Amsterdam. In 1672, Boursse sailed with Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie again. On November 16 he died at sea, on board the ship Rhenen. The life of Esaias Boursse is the story of a painter who could not earn a living by painting alone and therefore had to look for an alternative source of income. The fact that he was no exception is proven by the life stories of for example Jan Steen (who was also an innkeeper) and Johannes Vermeer (who was also an art dealer). A major difference though, is the fact that Steen and Vermeer had to feed and house a (large) family. Boursse seems to have remained unmarried and childless. Financially, Boursse's career was a success. He remains one of the highest paid artists in living memory.  Work  Boursse's work mainly deals with family life. Women spinning or sewing and families around a fireplace are examples of what to expect. Stylistically, his work is reminiscent of Pieter de Hooch, Quiringh van Brekelenkam and Cornelis de Man. About 28 paintings remain of his work, mostly in private collections. Works by Boursse to be found online are: * Rijksmuseum Amsterdam: \\"Interior with a woman sewing\\" (1661) * Wallace Collection London: \\"Interior with a woman cooking\\" (1653) Good examples 'in real life' (not online though) are also to be found in Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam, the Suermondt-Ludwig- Museum in Aachen, the Gem√§ldegalerie in Berlin, the Frits Lugt-collection (Fondation Custodia) in Paris and the Johannesburg Art Gallery.

His contributions to the education of black students led to a library being named in his honor in Tuscaloosa. George Weaver was born in 1872, the son of Lawrence and Lucy Elizabeth Weaver of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Lawrence Weaver was a blacksmith, businessman and landowner as well as a trustee for the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church of Tuscaloosa. He was the father of six children and sent all of them to college. George Augustus Weaver was his oldest child and graduated from Talladega College in 1892. George Weaver was the principal of a school for black students in Gadsden, Alabama for one year and then attended Howard University. He graduated from Howard University with a medical degree in 1899 and interned at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Weaver returned to Tuscaloosa in 1900 and was a surgeon at Stillman Hospital, located on the campus of Stillman College. Dr. Weaver was most active in church, civic and fraternal affairs. His Fraternal affairs includes: Charter Member, 1st Worshipful Master, of Rescue Lodge #234, F & AM PHA in 1905, and Grand Senior Warden of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge F & AM State of Alabama in 1906-07. He was a trustee and deacon of the First African Baptist Church. During this time he made his personal library available for black students to use in their studies. In 1960 Mrs. Ruth Bolden, the first librarian for what is now the Weaver-Bolden Library Branch (part of the Tuscaloosa Public Library system), requested that the library be named for Dr. Weaver to honor his contributions to young people and his generosity with his own books to the students of the area.

A larva typically attacks the first part of the plant it encounters, namely the stem, often of a seedling, and consequently cuts it down; hence the name cutworm. Cutworms are not worms, biologically speaking, but caterpillars. Feeding and hiding Cutworm larvae vary in their feeding behaviour; some remain with the plant they cut down and feed on it, while others often move on after eating a small amount from a felled seedling; such a wasteful mode of feeding results in disproportionate damage to crops. Cutworms accordingly are serious pests to gardeners in general, but to vegetable and grain farmers in particular. For example, it has been suggested that in South Africa for one, Agrotis segetum is the second worst pest of maize.Smit, Bernard, \\"Insects in South Africa: How to Control them\\", Pub: Oxford University Press, Cape Town, 1964. Note that the cutworm mode of feeding is only one version of a strategy of avoiding predators and parasitoids by day. Many other caterpillars, including Noctuidae and some kinds of processionary caterpillars, come out at night to feed, but hide again as soon as the sky begins to grow lighter. Some, for example Klugeana philoxalis attack low-growing forbs such as Oxalis in the dark, and drop to the ground as soon as a light is flashed on them. Others will climb trees such as species of acacia nightly, leaving trails of silk, but they leave individual trails, not common trails like processionary caterpillars. The fruit-piercing moth Serrodes partita similarly lives under litter beneath its food plant, the tree Pappea capensis Species and habits The term cutworm applies mainly to larvae of various species in the Noctuidae, a large family of moths; however many noctuid species are not cutworms, and some moths whose larvae have essentially the same habit, which justifies calling them cutworms, are not noctuids. The larvae of the turnip moth, (Agrotis segetum, Agrotis ipsilon, Agrotis exclamationis), are well-known noctuids whose larvae are very damaging cutworms. Cutworms are notorious agricultural and garden pests. They are voracious leaf, bud, and stem feeders and can destroy entire plants. They get their name from their habit of \\"cutting\\" off a seedling at ground level by chewing through the stem. Some species are subterranean and eat roots. One of the most common garden pests is the variegated cutworm (Peridroma saucia), which can defoliate entire gardens and fields in a matter of days. Appearance and control Cutworms are usually green, brown, grey, or yellow soft-bodied caterpillars, often with longitudinal stripes, up to 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in length. There are many variations among the genera. There also are variations in their biology and control, so the following extension material must be applied only as appropriate to the region. In many climates, cutworms will winter under the soil, either as final instar larvae or as pupae. This affords farmers an opportunity for control. Winter ploughing will kill many of the pests, and expose many more to predators. In suitable areas this is a powerful means of control, for example in grain fields. The same principle permits some domestic gardeners to kill the caterpillars without the problems associated with the use of pesticides; the first line of control can be to till the soil some weeks before planting to destroy any dormant larvae. Also, at any time during the season, if the population has been reasonably well controlled, but there are signs of localised cutworm attack, the domestic gardener may be able to deal with the problem simply by digging the soil and wet foliage to about 2 inches deep, and killing the caterpillars manually. Starvation also can be effective when it is practical to keep weeds down before the growing season, by systematic cultivation. Together with reducing manure and compost, relying instead on other forms of fertilizer, this can improve control by discouraging cutworm moths from laying their eggs, and depriving the larvae of food. Baits also can be effective where starvation strategies have been applied reasonably successfully; a sweetened bran mash containing a suitable stomach poison can be very effective against the small numbers of surviving caterpillars. The mash should be too crumbly and too thinly scattered to leave any lumps on the ground that domestic animals or desirable wild animals might otherwise pick up. Because cutworms attack the first part of the plant they find at night, plant collars made of aluminum, or even cardboard barriers, can offer effective protection.Sorensen, Kenneth A., et al.

Center for Integrated Pest Management, North Carolina State University: Controlling Cutworms Alternatively, a gallon planter with both ends removed may be used. Hosts for parasitoids Cutworms are hosts for numerous parasitoid wasps and flies, including species of Braconidae, Ichneumonidae, Tachinidae and Eulophidae, with rates of parasitism as high as 75‚Äì80 percent.University of Florida, Department of Entomology and Nematology References Category:Agrotis Category:Agricultural pest insects Category:Insect common names Category:Larvae ","title":"Cutworm"},{"id":"2539182","title":"Gevgelija"},{"id":"2539201","text":"Francesco Bracciolini (26 November 1566 ‚Äì 31 August 1645) was an Italian poet. Bracciolini was born of a noble family in Pistoia in 1566. On his removing to Florence he was admitted into the academy there, and devoted himself to literature. At Rome he entered the service of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, with whom he afterwards went to France. After the death of Clement VIII he returned to his own country; and when his patron Barberini was elected pope, under the name of Urban VIII, Bracciolini repaired to Rome and was made secretary to the pope's brother, Cardinal Antonio Marcello Barberini. Bracciolini had also the honor conferred on him of taking a surname from the arms of the Barberini family, which were bees; whence he was afterwards known by the name of Bracciolini dell Api. During Urban's pontificate the poet lived at Rome in considerable reputation, though at the same time he was censored for his sordid avarice. On the death of the pontiff Bracciolini returned to Pistoia, where he died in 1645. There is scarcely any species of poetry, epic, dramatic, pastoral, lyric or burlesque, which Bracciolini did not attempt; but he is principally noted for his mock-heroic poem Lo Scherno degli Dei published in 1618, similar but confessedly inferior to the contemporary work of Alessandro Tassoni, La secchia rapita. Of his serious heroic poems the most celebrated is La Croce Racquistata.

It is considered a pest but although unsightly, does not harm otherwise healthy trees. It is well known to commercial tree services and arboriculturists.  Description  The adult fall webworm has a wingspan of approximately 30 mm and is generally white-colored, although some individuals may have dark-colored marks. Distribution The moth is native to North America, ranging from Canada to Mexico. It is one of the few insect pests introduced from North America into other continents. Introduced to what was formerly Yugoslavia in the 1940s (firstly recorded in 1949), it now has occupied probably its entire range in Europe from France to the Caspian Sea in the east as well as penetrated into Central Asia: Turkmenistan (from 1990 to 1993), Uzbekistan (Fergana valley from 1996 to 1997), Kyrgyzstan, and southeastern Kazakhstan. It was also introduced into Japan in 1945 and has adjusted its number of generations per year since its arrival. It spread into China, southern Mongolia, Korea and southern Primorsky Krai of Russia so that now it is considered holarctic in distribution. The fall webworm originated in North America but spread very quickly across the world due to factors such as trade and rapid transit. Life cycle One generation per year emerges in the northern part of North America, with larvae appearing in late summer through early fall. South of an approximate latitude of 40¬∞N there are two or more generations annually, with webs appearing progressively earlier further south. =Eggs= The adult moth lays her eggs on the underside of leaves in 'hair'-covered clusters of a few hundred.Douce, GK. \\"The Fall Webworm\\" . Accessed August 21, 2006. Eggs hatch in about a week.Hyche, LL. \\"Fall webworm: A Guide to Recognition and Habits in Alabama\\". Accessed August 21, 2006. =Larva= The caterpillars are highly variable in coloration, ranging from a pale yellow to dark grey, with yellow spots and long and short bristles. There are two cream stripes along the sides. The two races--one more common in the north, the other in the south--differ in head capsule coloration. The maximum length of larvae is 35 mm. Webs are progressively enlarged and much messier looking than those of tent caterpillars (which occur only in spring and have shorter hairs and very little yellow on their bodies); also, webs from the fall webworm are concentrated to the tips of the branches, whereas the tent caterpillar webs are largely found in the unions. Larvae feed inside the tents until the late instars. Very young larvae feed only on the upper surfaces of leaves; later, they consume whole leaves. The larval stage lasts about four to six weeks. Larvae are known to wiggle vigorously at periodic intervals in synchrony. How they synchronize these movements especially when distributed over a wide area has not been established. =Pupa= The pupa stage overwinters in the bark and leaf litter at the base of the trees. It is dark brown and about 10 mm long. The thin brown cocoon is made of silk with bits of detritus interwoven. =Adult= Male Female The adult is mostly white in the North America regions, but in the south it may be marked with black or brown spots on the forewings. It is quite 'hairy' and the front legs have bright yellow or orange patches. The underwings will have less marking than the forewings, and the abdomen often has a sprinkling of brown hairs. It has a wingspan with a range of 35‚Äì42 mm. Illustration of webworm (1917) Food plants Webworms moving in their nest The fall webworm feeds on just about any type of deciduous tree, where leaves are chewed; branches or the entire tree may become defoliated. Worldwide, it has been recorded from 636 species, and it is considered to be among the most polyphagous of insects. In the eastern U.S., pecan trees (Carya illinoinensis), black walnut, American elm (Ulmus americana L.), hickory, fruit trees, and some maples are preferred hosts; in some areas persimmon and sweetgum are also readily eaten. In the west, alder, willow (Salix spp.), cottonwood and fruit trees are commonly used. Additional host plant examples include madrone (Arbutus menziesii Pursh), mulberry, ailanthus, American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.), and Asian white birch (Betula platyphylla). Host plant selection is dependent on factors like the plant's degree of sun exposure, age, environmental stress undergone, toughness, and nutritional quality. For example, for an insect that needs energy for processes like dispersal or diapause, consuming plants that provide a lot of carbohydrates could be beneficial; for a female insect that is producing eggs, consuming plants that provide a lot of protein could be beneficial. Image:Hyphantria.JPG  Late instar larva Image:Hypahntria web.JPG  Web on willow Image:Hyphantria_cunea_damage_on_Acer_negundo.JPG  Damage on Acer negundo  Behavior  The fall webworm is a gregarious insect. Groups of larvae live in self-created large webs that are found on tree branches. These webs allow for the finding of mates, temperature regulation, increased growth rate, and protection from predators, but also result in higher rates of infections and predation. The caterpillars of the fall webworm have several strategies to defend against threats. Some examples of protective behavior or defense are shaking and jerking together, repellant scent, and irritants on hairs or spines. The fall webworm exhibits a form of parental care, where the female will try to protect the eggs after oviposition by covering her newly laid eggs with her abdomen hairs.  Reproduction  = Mating limitations = Male fall webworms are typically only available for mating for about 30‚Äì60 minutes per day. = Sex pheromone = The sex pheromone consists of the components (9Z,12Z)- 9,12-octadecadienal (I), (9Z,12Z,15Z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienal (II), cis-9,10-epoxy-(3Z,6Z)-3,6-henicosa- diene (III), and cis-9,10-epoxy-(3Z,6Z)-1,3,6-henicosatriene (IV).  Physiology  = Thermoregulation = Fall webworms experience behavioral thermoregulation. The fall webworms' self-created web (which is where the fall webworms live) is able to trap heat. Due to this, the fall webworm (which is an ectotherm) is able to maintain a warm temperature of about 40-50 ¬∞C, which allows the larvae to grow and develop faster. Inside the web, there is a temperature difference because the central part tends to have a higher temperature, while the back part tends to have a lower temperature. However, a web's heat trapping process is not always stable; wind can disturb the heat trapping. = Intestinal tract = There are several components to the fall webworm gut, such as the foregut and the midgut. The foregut and midgut of the fall webworm are alkaline, and Johnson and Felon found that the midgut pH ranged from 8.7 to 11.4.  Natural enemies  = Predators = There are many predators of the fall webworm, such as Monomorium minimum, Vespula spp., Coleomegilla maculata, and Rogas hyphantriae. = Parasites = The fall webworm is parasitized by around 50 species, such as Musca domestica L, Muscina stabulans, and Chouioia cunea. There are also several species of microsporida that can be harmful, such as Nosema necatrix Kramer (N. necatrix), Pleistophora schubergi hyphantriae Weiser (P.s. hyphantriae), Nosema sp., and Nosema bombycis (N. bombycis ). Nosema bombycis can affect many body tissues, such as the midgut, fat body, gonads, nervous tissue, and Malpighian tubules, and the length of its polar filament is 100 ¬µm. Spores from Nosema of fall webworms are typically egg- shaped and can sometimes be attached to each other, and the length of its polar filament is 57.5 ¬µm ¬± 8.7 ¬µm. = Diseases = Several types of pathogens can infect this species, such as granulovirus (which causes granulosis disease) and nucleopolyhedrosis virus. Granulovirus has a rod-like shape. Also, an individual will be more likely to be infected at a younger age.  Interaction with humans  The fall webworm‚Äôs interaction with humans is important because of how adaptable this species is, which is one of the main reasons that it spread so widely across the world. Fall webworms are able to forage on large amounts of leaves inside their web, they are able to create webs on many different types of host plants, they are able to create webs at many different elevations and of many different shapes, and they spread very quickly. In addition, the fall webworm tends to create many webs or defoliate plants in places that humans spend time, such as recreational areas and parks; fall webworms tend to create their webs on branches and therefore defoliate parts of the tree that are very visible and draw attention. There have been methods with trying to control this organism, such as physical removal or chemical methods; however, there are some issues with these options because physical removal can be challenging with certain types of trees (based on factors like how tall the tree is, what its function is, where it is located), and the side effects of chemicals (such as important pollinators dying and therefore not being able to perform their functions).

He appeared in the 1954 film Adventures of the Barber of Seville and Le Chanteur de Mexico (1957) and became popular in France as well as his native Spain. Biography Luis Mariano was born in Irun, Spain on 13 August 1914, the son of a garagiste and taxi-driver and showed interest in singing as a child. His family moved to France at the start of the Spanish Civil War and settled in Bordeaux where he studied at the Conservatoire, and also sang in cabarets.G√§nzl K. The Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre. Blackwell, Oxford, 1994. Jeanne Lagiscarde, who was in charge of the classical department of a record store in Bordeaux, took Mariano under her wing, and gave up her job to nurture his talent in Paris. To earn a living, he sang in stage shows and appeared in films, starting with 'L'escalier sans fin' in 1943. That year he auditioned for the role of Ernesto in Don Pasquale, and sang in the opera at the Palais de Chaillot and later at the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s, with Vina Bovy, recording excerpts from the opera. He also left many recordings of popular song and operetta. He continued to appear in other films from 1946, including a singing role in Napol√©on and a film adaptation of Lehar's Der Zarewitsch. In his encyclopedia G√§nzl describes Mariano as a \\"svelte singing idol of French operetta of the post-war stage and screen\\". Mariano died in Paris in 1970. His music is featured prominently in the 1996 Belgian film Le huiti√®me jour in which he is played by Laszlo Harmati during scenes employing magical realism. In 2014, French baritone David Serero recorded an album with Mariano classics performed in a Jazz version for the 100th anniversary of his birth: David Serero chante Luis Mariano ‚Äì jazz version.

The government later stated that he had not accounted for \\"a period of his life, from 1992 to the end of that decade\\". =Arrest and release= Adil Charkaoui is represented in a 2004 protest outside the Toronto office of CSIS. From 2001 to 2003, Charkaoui operated a Montreal pizzeria, where the CSIS first approached him in the wake of 9/11. He refused to account for his whereabouts or reason for travel to Pakistan. Moroccan authorities stated that Charkaoui provided funds and resources to an Islamic insurgent group. Charkaoui was arrested under a security certificate in May 2003, which was co-signed by Solicitor General Wayne Easter, and Immigration Minister Denis Coderre.The Guardian, \\"Montreal Man Suspected of Terror Links\\", May 24, 2003 He was detained without charge or trial in Rivi√®re des prairies Detention Centre. The Coalition Justice for Adil Charkaoui was formed in defense of his rights, with Coalition launching a campaign for his release. He was released from prison on C$50,000 bail on 18 February 2005.

He sent a letter asking for an apology, Canadian citizenship and compensation for lost income and legal fees after a federal judge quashed a security certificate against him.

Citing security concerns, the event was cancelled by the convention centre where it was supposed to be held. Charkaoui maintained that it was Islamophobia to ban their visit to Canada. =Activities at Coll√®ge de Maisonneuve= For a time prior to 2015, Charkaoui rented classroom space every Sunday from Coll√®ge de Maisonneuve, a Montreal Cegep near the Olympic Stadium, for Muslim education and Arabic language studies, which he calls l'√âcole des compagnons. Charkaoui also rented classroom space at the nearby Coll√®ge de Rosemont, also a Cegep.lapresse.ca: \\"Un autre √©l√®ve d'Adil Charkaoui en Syrie\\", 28 Feb 2015 It was reported in February 2015 that six of his young students had absconded to Syria, allegedly with intent to join an Islamic terrorist group, either ISIS or the Nusra Front. Of these, four students were following his guidance at the de Maisonneuve location, and at least one teenager, Mohammed Rifaat, he knew through the Rosemont location. Before the week was out, Charkaoui threatened to sue both Colleges because they had terminated the arrangements under which he leased the classroom spaces.lapresse.ca: \\"Suspension des locations de locaux: Charkaoui ¬´sid√©r√©¬ª\\", 27 Feb 2015 At a press conference, he deemed the termination unacceptable and dishonest. An interview of Charkaoui by ICI RDI's Anne-Marie Dussault sparked quite a bit of controversy the following week.voir.ca: \\"Entrevue avec Charkaoui: mesurer le malaise en clics\\", 4 Mar 2015 Dressed in a djellaba, Charkaoui presented himself as a victim and rejected calls for him to condemn violent jihadism and the Islamist project.ledevoir.com: \\"Faut-il interdire les pr√©dicateurs musulmans?\\", 6 Mar 2015 Instead he accused occidental politicians of promoting violence against Muslims in a degenerate, Islamophobic culture. Charkaoui maintained that ISIS was a creature of the US government, and on his website he hyperlinks to other websites that offer praise of Osama bin Laden. He rejects any interference of the wider community in which he lives on his religious rights; he finds this argument to be nefarious. One commentator was shocked because of what his position meant in the context of his pedagogical pursuits. Court challenges to security certificate Charkaoui has consistently denied the allegations against him and has challenged the legitimacy of the security certificate regime. Canadian authorities and the Federal Court have refused to disclose the case against Charkaoui, relying on provisions in the security certificate process that allow evidence to be kept from the defence and the public. Charkaoui's certificate has not undergone a court review and thus has not been upheld. The case has been suspended since March 2005, pending a new decision on protection by the Minister of Immigration. Charkaoui has been at the centre of a public campaign against the extension of state power in the name of the \\"war on terror\\". In February 2006, Amnesty International reminded Canada, \\"His fundamental right to liberty and security of the person accords him the right to due process or release from the restrictive bail conditions that have been imposed on him.\\" In February 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision of Charkaoui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) on the appeals Charkaoui, Hassan Almrei, and Mohamed Harkat. The Court ruled that the certificate process violated sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and struck down the security certificate legislation (sections 33 and 77 to 85 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act). However, the judgment will not take effect for one year. In March 2007, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a second challenge by Charkaoui, this time relating to the destruction of evidence in Charkaoui's case. Government lawyers revealed in January 2005 that CSIS had destroyed evidence in Charkaoui's file. The situation raised concerns about the accuracy of the secret evidence before the court. The Supreme Court will hear the challenge in January 2008. In April 2007, Charkaoui submitted a leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in a third challenge; in this instance to the law permitting deportation of non-citizens when there is a risk of torture. The Canadian government's position is that legal safeguards against being sent to torture do not apply to people who are subject to a security certificate, basing this policy on their interpretation of the 2002 Supreme Court Suresh decision. Charkaoui is challenging the legal framework permitting deportation to torture, the lack of due process, as well as the fact of being subject to the threat of deportation to torture and excessive procedural delays. A CSIS agent identified only as J.P., the Deputy Chief of Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation in the Ottawa Regional Office as of 2005, testified against the petitions for release by Hassan Almrei, Mahmoud Jaballah and Charkaoui.Lemieux, Justice. \\"Hassan Almrei and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Minister of Public Safety. \\"\\"Reasons for Judgment and Judgment\\", October 5, 2007 In June 2008, Charkaoui managed to have the Supreme Court of Canada overturn as unconstitutional the security certificate. The ruling is known as Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2008 SCC 38. CSIS was ordered by the SCC to stop destroying its tapes and notes in terrorism investigations. For the previous 25 years CSIS had interpreted their constitutional law as obliging the destruction of such records - a procedure that largely kept CSIS intelligence out of open court - but this was ruled by the SCC a fundamental mistake. Given spies were becoming closer to police in the post-9/11 world, they had to disclose their investigations just like police do. The judges ruled \\"The only appropriate remedy is to confirm the duty to disclose Charkaoui's entire file to the designated judge and, after the judge has filtered it, to Charkaoui and his counsel.\\" In motions filed the next summer in Federal Court, lawyers arguing for CSIS said it could not abide by such vast disclosure without jeopardizing its source and methods, which CSIS considers the lifeblood of national security. The Crown pulled all of the wiretaps it used against Charkaoui, and half of its human sources, leaving it with insufficient evidence to meet the security certificate's test that there is a \\"reasonable suspicion\\" that Charkaoui is a threat to Canadian national- security. The judgment proceeded accordingly in September 2009. In May 2013 federal prosecutors produced evidence that Charkaoui may have been plotting a terrorist attack in the Montreal metro in 2002. The memo also mentions CSIS surveillance where Charkaoui was spotted stealing valuables from parked cars.lapresse.ca: \\"Adil Charkaoui soup√ßonn√© par le SCRS\\", 8 May 2013 =Ahmed Ressam withdraws his allegations= Fabrice de Pierrebourg of the Journal de Montreal testified in Federal Court on 22 August 2007 that, in correspondence, Ahmed Ressam had withdrawn his allegations against Adil Charkaoui; the former had written to the latter, who is also known as the Millennium Bomber for his failed plot to bomb LAX airport, in the course of writing a book about terrorism in Montreal. Ressam was convicted in the United States and held under an unusual arrangement whereby he was offered a reduced sentence in exchange for information. Under this arrangement, over a period of some years, he fingered 130 people as \\"members\\" of the \\"extremist Islamist network linked to Bin Laden\\". Two cases in the United States were dismissed after Ressam's evidence proved worthless. Earlier in Charkaoui's case, Charkaoui's lawyer introduced an arrest warrant for Ahmed Ressam for an incident that occurred in Montreal at a time when Ressam claimed, under oath in another case, to have been in a training camp in Afghanistan. Ressam is known to have suffered a mental breakdown while in prison. After learning that Mr. Ressam was supposed to have named him, Charkaoui repeatedly asked to be able to cross-examine him in court, but the motion was not granted. In the original charges against Charkaoui, two government ministers mistakenly referred to martial arts having been used by a hijacker aboard \\"American Airlines Flight 93\\", a mistaken reference likely meant to refer to United Airlines 93 or American Airlines Flight 11.

It is usually written in the form :\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{tot}=\\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{k}~\\\\mathrm{Im}\\\\,f(0), where (0) is the scattering amplitude with an angle of zero, that is, the amplitude of the wave scattered to the center of a distant screen, and is the wave vector in the incident direction.

History  The optical theorem was originally developed independently by Wolfgang SellmeierThe original publication omits his first name, which however can be inferred from a few more publications contributed by him to the same journal. One web source says he was a former student of Franz Ernst Neumann. Otherwise, little to nothing is known about Sellmeier. and Lord Rayleigh in 1871.Strutt, J. W. (1871). XV. On the light from the sky, its polarization and colour. The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, 41(271), 107-120. Lord Rayleigh recognized the forward scattering amplitude in terms of the index of refraction as : n = 1 + 2\\\\pi \\\\frac{Nf(0)}{k^2} (where is the number density of scatterers), which he used in a study of the color and polarization of the sky. The equation was later extended to quantum scattering theory by several individuals, and came to be known as the Bohr‚ÄìPeierls‚ÄìPlaczek relation after a 1939 paper. It was first referred to as the \\"optical theorem\\" in print in 1955 by Hans Bethe and Frederic de Hoffmann, after it had been known as a \\"well known theorem of optics\\" for some time.  Derivation  The theorem can be derived rather directly from a treatment of a scalar wave. If a plane wave is incident along positive z axis on an object, then the wave amplitude a great distance away from the scatterer is approximately given by :\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\approx e^{ikz}+f(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}. All higher terms, when squared, vanish more quickly than 1/r^2, and so are negligible a great distance away. For large values of z and for small angles, a Taylor expansion gives us : r=\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\\\\approx z+\\\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2z}. We would now like to use the fact that the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude \\\\psi. Approximating 1/r as 1/z, we have :\\\\begin{align} \\\\psi^2 &\\\\approx \\\\lefte^{ikz}+\\\\frac{f(\\\\theta)}{z}e^{ikz}e^{ik(x^2+y^2)/2z}\\\\right^2 \\\\ &= 1+\\\\frac{f(\\\\theta)}{z}e^{ik(x^2+y^2)/2z}+\\\\frac{f^*(\\\\theta)}{z}e^{-ik(x^2+y^2)/2z}+\\\\frac{f(\\\\theta)^2}{z^2}. \\\\end{align} If we drop the 1/z^2 term and use the fact that c+c^*=2\\\\operatorname{Re}{c}, we have :\\\\psi^2 \\\\approx 1+2\\\\operatorname{Re}{\\\\left[\\\\frac{f(\\\\theta)}{z}e^{ik(x^2+y^2)/2z}\\\\right]}. Now suppose we integrate over a screen far away in the xy plane, which is small enough for the small-angle approximations to be appropriate, but large enough that we can integrate the intensity over -\\\\infty to \\\\infty in x and y with negligible error. In optics, this is equivalent to summing over many fringes of the diffraction pattern. To further simplify matters, let's approximate f(\\\\theta)=f(0). We obtain :\\\\int \\\\psi^2\\\\,dx\\\\,dy \\\\approx A +2\\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\left[\\\\frac{f(0)}{z}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{ikx^2/2z}dx\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{iky^2/2z}dy\\\\right], where A is the area of the surface integrated over. Although these are improper integrals, by suitable substitutions the exponentials can be transformed into complex Gaussians and the definite integrals evaluated resulting in: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\psi^2\\\\,da &= A - 2\\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\left[\\\\frac{f(0)}{z}\\\\,\\\\frac{2\\\\pi z}{i k}\\\\right] \\\\ &= A - \\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{k}\\\\,\\\\operatorname{Im}[f(0)].\\\\end{align} This is the probability of reaching the screen if none were scattered, lessened by an amount (4\\\\pi/k)\\\\operatorname{Im}[f(0)], which is therefore the effective scattering cross section of the scatterer.

Seigworth and Melissa Gregg, The Affect Theory Reader, ed. Seigworth and Gregg (Durham : Duke University Press, 2010), p. 5. Massumi received his B.A. in Comparative Literature at Brown University (1979) and his Ph.D in French Literature from Yale University (1987). After a Mellon postdoctoral fellowship in the Stanford University Department of French and Italian (1987-1988), he settled in Montr√©al, Canada, where he taught first at McGill University (Comparative Literature Program) and later at the Universit√© de Montr√©al (Communication Department), retiring in 2018. Massumi has lectured widely around the world, and his writings have been translated into more than fifteen languages. Since 2004, he has collaborated with the SenseLab,SenseLab.

Retrieved: April 17, 2018 as an experimental \\"laboratory for thought in motion\\" operating at the intersection of philosophy, art, and activism. Philosophy Massumi situates his work in the tradition of process philosophy, which he defines broadly to encompass a range of thinkers whose work privileges concepts of event and emergence. For Massumi, this includes not only Alfred North Whitehead, the philosopher most closely identified with the term, but also Charles Sanders Peirce, Henri Bergson, Gilbert Simondon, Gilles Deleuze, and F√©lix Guattari.,Brian Massumi, Politics of Affect (London: Polity, 2015), p. viii. on all of whose work he draws extensively. He articulates process philosophy with William James's radical empiricism, which asserts the primacy of relation. This is the doctrine that relations are real, are directly experienced, and create their own terms.Brian Massumi, Semblance and Event: Activist Philosophy and the Occurrent Arts (Cambridge, M.A.: MIT Press, 2011), p. 4, 29-30, 34-37, 85-86. Massumi has also characterized his work as \\"activist philosophy\\" (a philosophy for which the ultimate concept is activity rather than substanceMassumi, Semblance and Event, op. cit., pp. 1-28Brian Massumi, The Principle of Unrest: Activist Philosophy in the Expanded Field, (London: Open Humanities Press, 2017), p. 101); \\"speculative pragmatism\\" (a philosophy for which present practice bears as much on future potential as on existing functions and known utilitiesMassumi, Semblance and Event, op. cit., p. 85-86, 179.Erin Manning and Brian Massumi, Thought in the Act: Passages in the Ecology of Experience (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014), 157.); \\"ontogenetics\\" as opposed to ontology (a philosophy for which becoming is primary in relation to beingBrian Massumi, Parables for the Virtual: Movement, Affect, Sensation (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2002), pp. 8-10.); and \\"incorporeal materialism\\" (a philosophy attributing abstract dimensions of reality to the body and matter itselfMassumi, Parables for the Virtual, op. cit., pp. 6, 11, 16-17, 76.Brian Massumi, Ontopower: War, Power, and the State of Perception ((Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2015), p. 49.). =Theory of power= Massumi's earliest work on the theory of power is two-pronged. On the one hand, it examines processes of power centralization tending toward the absolutist state, which he broadly defines as fascist.Kenneth Dean and Brian Massumi, First and Last Emperors: The Absolute State and the Body of the Despot (New York: Autonomedia, 1992) On the other hand, influenced by the work of Michel Foucault, it examines processes by which power effects are distributed throughout the social field, in particular through the mass production of what he termed \\"low-level everyday fear.\\"Brian Massumi, ed., The Politics of Everyday Fear (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993) After the 9-11 attacks on the World Trade Towers, his theories of distributed power focused on the doctrine of preemption promulgated by the George W. Bush administration to serve as the framework for the \\"war on terror.\\" Massumi argues that preemption is more than a military doctrine, but has engrained itself as an invasive mode of power operating in many forms throughout society.Brian Massumi, \\"Fear (The Spectrum Said),\\" Positions: East Asia Cultures Critique, special issue, \\"Against Preemptive War,\\" vol. 113, no. 1 (Spring 2005), pp. 31-48.

Gregory Seigworth and Melissa Gregg (Durham: Duke University Press, 2010), pp. 52-70. Revised and reprinted in Massumi, Ontopower, op. cit., pp. 189-205. He sees this mode of power as paradoxically productive. He gives it the label \\"ontopower\\" (the power to bring to be).Massumi, Ontopower, op. cit.Massumi, The Power at the End of the Economy (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2015) Ontopower, according to Massumi, is related to but distinct from disciplinary power and biopower as analyzed by Foucault. It is allied Foucault's concept of \\"environmentality.\\"Brian Massumi, \\"National Enterprise Emergency: Steps Toward an Ecology of Powers,\\" Theory, Culture & Society, special issue Michel Foucault and Biopower, vol. 26, no. 6 (2009): 153-185. Revised and reprinted in Massumi, Ontopower, op. cit., pp. 21-59. Massumi analyzes ontopower as entwined with neoliberal capitalism. He argues that this entwinement makes the capitalist economy a direct power formation in its own right.Brian Massumi, 99 Theses on the Revaluation of Value: A Postcapitalist Manifesto, (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2018). The idea that capitalist ontopower is a direct power formation that modulates the social field of emergence to capture becoming raises fundamental questions about what form political resistance and anticapitalist struggle can take. Massumi argues that there is no position \\"outside\\" capitalist power from which to critique or resist.\\"Capital Moves,\\" The Principle of Unrest, op. cit., chapter 1, pp. 7-71.Massumi, 99 Theses on the Revaluation of Value, op. cit. The potential for political action nonetheless remains, but requires strategies of \\"immanent critique\\" that counter-modulate the social field of emergence.Massumi, Politics of Affect, op. cit., 71, 106-107, 110\\"On Critique,\\" Inflexions: A Journal for Research Creation, no. 4 (January 2011), pp. 337-340 Retrieved April 18, 2018.Massumi, The Power at the End of the Economy, op. cit., pp. 79-95 These forms of resistance occur at the \\"micropolitical\\" level. The word micropolitics does not refer to the scale at which action takes place, but rather to its mode.Massumi, \\"Of Micropolitcs and Microperception,\\" Inflexions: A Journal for Research Creation, no. 3 (October 2009), pp. 183-275 Retrieved April 18, 2018. Revised and reprinted in Massumi, Politics of Affect, op. cit., pp. 47-82.Massumi, The Principle of Unrest, op. cit., pp. 63-65 =Philosophy of experience= Massumi's approach to perception and the philosophy of experience is closely tied to his political philosophy through the theory of affect.Brian Massumi, \\"The Political is Not Personal,\\" interview with Brad Evans, LA Review of Books, November 12, 2017. Retrieved April 17, 2018. Massumi famously distinguishes emotion from affect. Following Spinoza, he defines affect as \\"the capacity to affect and be affected.\\" This locates affect in encounters in the world, rather than the interiority of a psychological subject. Emotion, he argues, is the interiorization of affect toward psychological expression. He locates affect as such in a nonconscious \\"zone of indistinction\\" or \\"zone of indeterminacy\\" between thought and action.Massumi, Ontopower, op. cit., p. 39, 204-205Massumi, The Power at the End of the Economy, op. cit., pp. 6-24. This zone of indeterminacy is the \\"field of emergence\\" of determinate experience, but itself resists capture in functional systems or structures of meaning. Affect's resistance to capture leaves a \\"remainder\\" of unactualized capacity that continues in the world as a \\"reserve\\" of potential available for a next determination, or \\"taking-form\\" of experience in definitive action, perception and emotion.Massumi, \\"Keywords for Affect,\\" The Power at the End of the Economy, op. cit., pp. 103-112.Brian Massumi, \\"Too-Blue: Color-Patch for an Expanded Empiricism,\\" Cultural Studies, 14:2 (April 2000), pp. 253-302. Reprinted in Massumi, Parables for the Virtual, op. cit., chapter 9, pp. 208-255. Massumi refers to this remaindering of potential across an ongoing process of serial formation as the \\"autonomy\\" of affectMassumi, \\"The Autonomy of Affect,\\" op.cit. Affect is implicated in all modes of experience, including language experience, as an accompanying dimension of becoming.Massumi, Semblance and Event, op. cit., chapter 4, pp. 105-179. Conversely, all modes of experience are held together in the affective field of emergence in a state of \\"incipiency.\\" The difference between modes of experience is not erased in this zone of indistinction, but is present \\"germinally\\" as a minimal differential. The modes of experience untangle from each other to come to expression divergently, actualizing different tendencies.Brian Massumi, What Animals Teach Us about Politics (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2014), pp. 34-35, 45-59. The process of the taking-form of experience is \\"pulsed.\\" Each definitive taking-form reemerges from the field of emergence after a lapse that Massumi identifies with the \\"missing half-second\\" in conscious experience experimentally verified by neuropsychologist Benjamin Libet.Massumi, \\"Autonomy of Affect,\\" op. cit.Massumi, \\"Perception Attack,\\" Ontopower, op. cit, chapter 2, pp. 63-92. Quoting Whitehead, he maintains that \\"consciousness flickers\\"Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality (New York: Free Press, 1978), p. 267; cited in Massumi, Ontopower, pp. 95-96. Between pulses, experience returns to immanence in the zone of indistinction of the field of emergence, where it is \\"primed\\" (energized and oriented) for a next taking-form.Massumi, Ontopower, op. cit., chapters 3 and 4.Massumi, The Power at the End of the Economy, op. cit., chapter 2. This occurs at the nonconscious level of \\"intensity\\" of experience. In his later work, Massumi develops the concept of \\"bare activity\\"Massumi, Semblance and Event, op. cit., pp. 3-5.Massumi, Ontopower, op. cit., pp. 45-49.Massumi, The Principle of Unrest, op. cit., pp. 14, 29-34. to aid in the analysis of the affective field of emergence in which modes of activity that divergently express, for example as \\"mental\\" versus \\"physical,\\"\\"action\\" versus \\"perception,\\" or \\"rational\\" versus \\"emotional,\\" are in what he calls a state of \\"mutual inclusion.\\"Massumi, What Animals Teach Us about Politics, op. cit. (for which \\"co-motion,\\" \\"superposition,\\" and \\"reciprocal presupposition\\" are synonyms in Massumi's vocabulary). Mutual inclusion is the logic of immanence, which does not obey the law of the excluded middle. The concept of mutual inclusion in bare activity has consequences for the theory of perception. It focuses the theory of perception on the interfusion of the senses (cross-modal relay or synesthesia)Massumi, Parables for the Virtual, chapters 6 and 7, pp. 144-176Brian Massumi, \\"The Art of the Relational Body: From Mirror-Touch to the Virtual Body,\\" Mirror-Touch: Thresholds of Empathy with Art, ed.

Massumi ties amodal perception to the \\"proprioceptive\\" experience of movement perception,Massumi, Parables for the Virtual, chapters 2, 6, 7, 8Massumi, \\"The Art of the Relational Body,\\" op. cit. and argues that the experience of movement is primary in relation to objects.Massumi, Parables for the Virtual, op. cit., Introduction, pp. 1-22Massumi, Semblance and Event, op. cit., pp. 105-127. Massumi's emphasis on amodal perception gives modes of abstraction (\\"nonsensuous perception\\") a direct role in the emergence of experience. This troubles the distinction between the concrete and the abstract.Massumi, \\"Introduction: Concrete Is as Concrete Doesn't,\\" Parables for the Virtual, op. cit., pp. 1-22. Massumi analyzes the constitutive role of abstract dimensions of reality in terms of the \\"reality of the virtual,\\" expanding on Bergson's theory of the virtual as reinterpreted by Deleuze.Massumi, Parables for the Virtual, op. cit.\\"Envisioning the Virtual,\\" The Oxford Handbook of Virtuality, ed. Mark Grimshaw (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2014), pp. 55-70. He argues that the virtual, paradoxically, is itself actualized, in the form of a supplement of experience that he calls a \\"semblance.\\"Massumi, Semblance and Event, op. cit. A semblance in Massumi's vocabulary is the direct experience of the abstract \\"dynamic form\\" of an event. It carries a sense of vitality (\\"vitality affect\\") uniquely associated with the event. This supplementation of sensuous experience constitutes a \\"surplus-value of life.\\" Massumi's theories reject representational accounts of thought and perception, as well as any mind/body dualism. The latter is replaced by the integral event of \\"bodying,\\"Massumi, What Animals Teach Us about Politics , op. cit., p. 103-104. coinciding with the \\"movement of thought.\\"Massumi,\\"Movements of Thought,\\" The Principle of Unrest, op. cit., chapter 2, pp. 72-111 His emphasis on the nonconsciousness of the field of experience challenges the model of cognition in favor of a theory of \\"direct perception.\\"Massumi, Semblance and Event, op. cit., p. 11. Direct perception, in his account, is performative and emergent. It expresses and transmits affective powers that exceed cognitive apprehension. Direct perception, or \\"pure\\" experience, is nevertheless addressable in a mode of awareness Massumi calls \\"thinking-feeling\\"Massumi, \\"The Thinking-Feeling of What Happens,\\" Semblance and Event, chapter 2, pp. 39-86 (an embodied \\"affective attunement\\"Brian Massumi and Erin Manning, \\"Affective Attunement in the Field of Catastrophe,\\" in Massumi, Politics of Affect, op. cit., chapter 4, pp. 112-145 to relation and potential that he glosses in terms of Peirce's logical category of abductionMassumi, The Power at the End of the Economy, op. cit., 43-56.). Massumi argues that affect and direct perception are not confined within a human subject, but are \\"transindividual\\" and spread across the \\"nature‚Äìculture continuum.\\"Massumi, What Animals Teach Us about Politics, op. cit.Massumi, \\"What a Body Can Do,\\" Politics of Affect, chapter 6, pp. 177-204. This qualifies his thought as a variety of panexperientialism, and distances it from phenomenology. In this connection, he has characterized his thought as an \\"extreme realism,\\" by which he means a philosophy asserting the ultimate reality of qualities of experience, conceived as irreducible to either subjective qualia or objective properties, and as defying quantification.Brian Massumi, \\"Such As It Is: A Short Essay in Extreme Realism.,\\" Body & Society, vol. 22, no. 1 (March 2016), pp. 115-127.Brian Massumi, \\"Virtual Ecology and the Question of Value,\\" General Ecology: The New Ecological Paradigm, ed. Erich H√∂rl (London: Bloomsbury, 2017), pp. 345-373.Massumi, 99 Theses on the Revaluation of Value, op. cit. =Creativity= Massumi works from Whitehead's notion of \\"creative advance,\\" according to which the world is in a perpetual state of emergence characterized by the continual variation of form. The speculative and pragmatic aspects of his thought come together around the notion that specific practices can be developed to further this creative movement. In collaboration with Erin Manning, Massumi has developed a process-philosophical take on research-creation.Manning and Massumi, \\"Propositions for Thought in the Act,\\" Thought in the Act, op. cit., pp. 83-152 Research-creation is a category in Canadian academia akin to what is called \\"art-based research\\" in Europe.Erin Manning, \\"Against Method,\\" The Minor Gesture (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2016), chapter 1, pp. 26-45. Manning and Massumi extend the concept beyond the university and the specific domain of art. They advocate for an \\"ecology of practices\\" that explores how philosophical concepts formed in language can be \\"transduced\\" into other modes of experience in a way that furthers creative practice, and reciprocally, how the understanding that already imbues non-language based modes of experience can be brought to explicit expression in ways that further conceptual research. Through this two-way exchange, they see the potential to foster the emergence of new, nonstandard modes of knowledge that exceed disciplinary understanding and normative frames of perception. This affirmation of \\"minor\\" modes of thought and experience allies Manning and Massumi's vision of research-creation to the neurodiversity movement.Erin Manning, The Minor Gesture (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2016). As Manning and Massumi understand it, the practice of research-creation is necessarily collective and relational,Brian Massumi, \\"Collective Expression: A Radical Pragmatics,\\" Inflexions: A Journal for Research-Creation, \\"Radical Pedagogies\\" special issue, no. 8 (Spring 2015), pp. 59-88; revised and reprinted in Massumi, The Principle of Unrest, chapter 3, pp. 111-144. and thus carries a \\"proto-political\\" force of immanent critique.Brian Massumi and Erin Manning, \\"Immediation,\\" in Massumi, Politics of Affect, chapter 5, pp. 146-176.Brian Massumi, \\"Collective Expression: A Radical Pragmatics,\\" Inflexions: A Journal for Research-Creation, \\"Radical Pedagogies\\" special issue, no. 8 (Spring 2015), pp. 59-88; revised and reprinted in Massumi, The Principle of Unrest, chapter 3, pp. 111-144. Manning's SenseLab is conceived as a laboratory for the collaborative exploration of research-creation in its philosophical, aesthetic and political dimensions. Early life Massumi is the son of Rashid Massumi (Nain, Iran) from a first marriage to Elsie Szabo (Lorain, Ohio). Massumi's early childhood was spent between Lorain, Ohio and McLean, Virginia. His teenage years were spent in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he dedicated himself to ecological activism as part of the environmental movement of the early 1970s. His work with local and national environmental organizations on issues of wilderness preservation and land use, clean energy, and water conservation culminated in an internship in Washington, D.C. with The Wilderness Society, where he specialized on the issue of shale oil development.Oil Shale, Mining and Energy.

Disillusioned with lobbying and traditional politics, Massumi later moved toward direct action in the context of the anti-nuclear movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, he worked within a network of anarchist affinity groups called the Coalition for Direct Action at Seabrook (CDAS),L.A. Kauffman, Direct Action: Protest and the Reinvention of American Radicalism (London: Verso, 2017), pp. 62-64 an off-shoot of the Clamshell Alliance, on the organization of two occupation attempts of the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant construction site.\\"2500 Protestors are Driven Back at Seabrook Facility,\\" New York Times, October 7, 1979.

His particular area of focus was a planned prefigurative community, the Seabrook Freestate, that was established on squatted public land near the construction site in advance of the second occupation attempt to serve as a model for the anticipated occupation.Brian Tokar,\\"May 24: Where Did We Go Wrong?\\" . Retrieved April 17, 2018.Kauffman, Direct Action, op. cit., p. 140 Although these efforts failed, Massumi has remarked on the lasting influence that their model of direct action and direct democracy has had on his thinking.Citton, preface, L'√âconomie contre elle-m√™me, op. cit., p. 42. Criticism Most critical responses to Massumi's work focus on the 1995 essay \\"The Autonomy of Affect\\" and categorize him as an \\"affect theorist.\\" The distinction he makes between affect and emotion, and his assertion that affect is \\"autonomous\\" in the sense that it extends beyond linguistic signification and resists cultural coding, are particular subjects of contention. In an influential essay, Ruth LeysRuth Leys, \\"The Turn to Affect: A Critique,\\" Critical Inquiry, vol. 37, no. 3 (2011), pp. 434-472. asserts that Massumi establishes a \\"false dichotomy\\" between mind and matter, and thinking and feeling, and disqualifies the first term of each couple. This separates the body from subjectivity, and plays into scientistic frameworks assimilating the body to inert matter. Leys argues that this undermines intentionality and rationality, which in turn makes it impossible to account for ideology or to programmatically resist it. Leys further argues that Massumi's account of the \\"missing half-second\\" negates free will. Margaret Wetherell argues that Massumi draws too gross a demarcation between bodily experience and social action and establishes a starkly polarized distinction between controlled and autonomic processes.Margaret Wetherell, Affect and Emotion: A New Social Science Understanding (London: Sage, 2012), p. 65. In Wetherell's opinion, Massumi detours the study of affect and emotion toward particular philosophical preoccupations in ways that are \\"radically unhelpful\\"Wetherell, Affect and Emotion, op. cit., p. 3. and undermine a more judicious and \\"pragmatic\\"Wetherell, Affect and Emotion, op. cit., p. 3. approach grounded in the social psychology literature. Eugenie Brinkema, writing from a film theory perspective, similarly criticizes what she sees as Massumi's overreliance on the line of philosophical thinking about affect descending from Spinoza through Deleuze. She sees Massumi imposing a \\"split\\"Eugenie Brinkema, The Forms of Affect (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2012), p. 306. between affect and emotion that cuts affect off from signification, leaving it merely \\"formless\\" and \\"outside structure.\\"Brinkema, The Forms of Affect, op. cit., p. 30.

He was a local and colonial political leader during the American Revolution.  Biography  Bullitt was descended from French Huguenots. His grandfather, Benjamin Bullett (so spelled at the time), was a French Huguenot from Languedoc, Southern France who escaped France during the religious persecutions of Hugenots, following the Edict of Fontainebleau, and settled in the Province of Maryland in 1685 as a planter, operating a plantation near Port Tobacco in Charles County. Bullitt was one of the five children of Benjamin Bullitt, the son of Benjamin the Huguenot, and Elizabeth Harrison Bullitt. He was born on his parents' plantation in Fauquier County, Virginia. He and his brother, Thomas Bullitt, both settled in Prince William County and became locally prominent, Cuthbert as a planter and lawyer and Thomas as a soldier. Bullitt developed his plantation, known as Mount View, on a peninsula where Quantico Creek enters the Potomac River. He married Helen Scott, a member of a wealthy colonial Virginian family, in 1760 and had six children: Alexander Scott Bullitt, who became a pioneer settler in Louisville, Kentucky, Thomas James, Frances, Sarah, Helen, and Sophia. On 24 September 1765 Bullitt shot and killed Virginia Burgess John Baylis in a duel. Baylis had insulted Bullitt's brother-in-law, 18-year old John Scott. He was acquitted on grounds of self defense. As the American Revolutionary War neared, Bullitt became more active politically. He joined Prince William County's Committee of Safety along with Lynaugh Helm and Henry Lee. In 1776 he and Henry Lee III were the county's delegates to a revolutionary Provincial Congress of Virginia. That meeting became a constitutional convention, producing an interim constitution used by the province for the next several years. Under the new state's government, Bullitt became the Commonwealth Attorney (prosecutor) in Prince William County. He served at this post until he was appointed to the bench of a state court in 1780. When the Virginia Ratifying Convention met to ratify the United States Constitution in 1788, Judge Bullitt was again the delegate for the County and voted against ratification. He remained a judge until his death at Mount View in 1791. His will was dated May 16, 1791.

Biography Son of a pioneer American family of Swiss-English descent, Bonelli was born in Kingman, Arizona and moved to Los Angeles in 1912. He entered the University of Southern California and received his bachelor of arts degree in 1916. He then served in the Aviation Section of the U.S. Army in 1918-19 and remained in the Reserve as a pilot until 1934. Bonelli obtained his master of arts degree from Occidental College in 1923 and his law degree from Southwestern Law School in 1924; he was admitted to the California Bar in 1925. He became a promoter of the Southern California aircraft industry and the Santa Clarita Valley. He purchased Hoot Gibson's rodeo venue in 1937 in Saugus, California and ran rodeos until a quarter-mile dirt track was built in 1939; it was later renamed Bonelli Ranch Stadium. It hosted a myriad of events showcasing midget cars and hot rods (roadsters). Later, the track was expanded to one-third mile. In 1954, the surface was paved and the name changed to Saugus Speedway. The paved track brought on the transition to stock cars, which was the primary format through 1995, when the track was closed.

A wide range of models was produced under the Matchless name, ranging from small two-strokes to 750 cc four-stroke twins. Matchless had a long history of racing success; a Matchless ridden by Charlie Collier won the first single-cylinder race in the first Isle of Man TT in 1907. Matchless Isle of Man TT & MGP race results (Retrieved 30 August 2006) In 1938, Matchless and AJS became part of Associated Motorcycles (AMC), both companies producing models under their own marques. During the amalgamations that occurred in the British motorcycle industry in the 1960s, the Matchless four-stroke twin was replaced with the Norton twin, ending a long history of independent production. By 1967, the Matchless singles had ceased production.  History  The first Matchless motorcycle was made in 1899, and production began in 1901. Matchless was the trading name of Collier & Sons, the father Henry Herbert Collier and his sons Charlie and Harry. The Matchless tank badge was a winged \\"M\\". Like many motorcycle manufacturers of the time, they had started as bicycle manufacturers. They produced a JAP V-twin powered bike in 1905, with one of the earliest swing-arm rear suspensions, coupled with leading-link front forks. Charlie won the inaugural TT singles race in 1907 at an average speed of 38.21 mph in a time of 4 hours 8 minutes 8 seconds. Harry did not finish in 1907, but won in 1909, and Charlie won again in 1910, bringing Matchless motorcycles to the attention of the public. Matchless made mostly singles, but they also made V-twins from 496 cc to 998 cc. They made their own engines from 1912 on. 1905 Matchless 2¬Ωhp motorcycle1922 Matchless Model H 1000cc motorcycle and sidecar combination at Beamish Museum At the 1912 Olympia Motor Cycle and Cycle Car show Matchless showed a V-twin powered cycle car, with two wheels at the front and a single drive wheel at the rear.\\"The Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show\\", The Auto Motor Journal, 30 Nov 1912, p1448 Unusually the drive was by shaft and bevel gear. The frame was of pressed steel channel. It was priced at 100 guineas. Matchless was not given a contract to make motorcycles for the army during the First World War. Peacetime production resumed in 1919, concentrating at first on V-twins for sidecar use, leaving singles until 1923. In 1926 Henry Collier died, and by 1928 Matchless was a limited company. In 1930 they launched a narrow-angle 400 cc V-twin called the Silver Arrow, designed by Charlie. The Silver Arrow, launched in 1929, was a side-valve v-twin with 54 x 86mm dimensions and 394 cc. The two cylinders were set at 18 degrees within a single casting under a single head. The result looked odd, rather like a single that was too long, and with the exhaust emerging from the manifold at its right corner and the carburettor in the middle of the block on the left, the odd appearance was accentuated,History of Matchless Motorcycles Classic Motor History and in 1930 they launched an (advanced for the time) 593 cc OHC V-four, the Silver Hawk. Ian Chadwick Histories (Retrieved 21 October) About 60 out of the 500 made survive, The Hawk was designed by youngest brother Bert, who was now active in the company, and he was responsible for design right up to the war. Is-it-a-lemon Vehicle Histories (Retrieved 21 October) 1934 Morgan Super Sports with Matchless engine In 1931 Matchless bought AJS from the Stevens brothers. Matchless bought Sunbeam in the late thirties, but Sunbeam was sold to BSA in 1943. After that the only \\"true\\" AJS models, as far as AJS enthusiasts were concerned, were the racing 7Rs, Porcupines and the pre-war AJS Four. The shared models were considered by some AJS fans to be only badge-engineered Matchless models. In 1935 the Matchless/AJS hairpin valve springs made their first appearance. Matchless supplied engines for the V-twin versions of the Morgan three-wheeler from 1933 until Morgan production was halted by the outbreak of World War II in 1939. From 1935 on they were Morgan's exclusive supplier of V-twin engines. A dozen surviving unused engines were still in storage at the Morgan works in 1946 and were used to build a final batch of V-Twin trikes for a Morgan dealer in Australia. Matchless also supplied engines after 1935 to 1940 to the Brough Superior works. These engines were made to the specifications of Brough Superior and are not identical to similar engines used in Matchless motorcycles. The Brough Superior engines used a fork and blade rod configuration, cams ground to different specification, and larger ports in the cylinders or heads. = AMC (1938‚Äì66) = Associated Motor Cycles (AMC) was formed in 1938, as a parent company for Matchless and AJS motorcycles. AMC later (postwar) absorbed Francis-Barnett, James, and Norton. In 1941 Matchless motorcycles introduced telescopic front forks called \\"Teledraulic\\" forks, considered by some to be the first major innovation in British front suspension in 25 years. During the Second World War, Matchless manufactured 80,000 G3 and G3L models for the armed forces. By 1956 they had eight models in their line up, but the number had dwindled in 1965. The G3L was the first to feature the \\"Teledraulic\\" front forks. Post-war landmarks start with the production of Matchless/AJS 350 cc and Matchless G80 500 cc singles, developed from the legendary war-time Matchless G3 produced for the army. Competition models of the singles were produced from 1948, which gave the company some memorable wins. 1949 Matchless G80S at auction in 2007 Matchless 1950 Matchless G80 Matchless G45 1959(?) Matchless G50 500 cc In 1949 the first Matchless/AJS vertical twin, a 500 cc, was produced; later to be joined by 600 cc and 650 cc vertical twins in 1956 and 1959 respectively. On the racing front AMC were fielding the (supercharged) AJS Porcupine and the AJS 7R alongside the 1951 Matchless G45 500 cc vertical twin. Even when supercharging was banned, Les Graham won the 1949 500 cc world championship on a normally aspirated Porcupine. Jampot History (retrieved 21 October 2006), For 1952, the Model G45 twin-cylinder production racer was introduced. Its pushrod 500 cc OHV vertical twin-cylinder engine was based on the roadster Model G9, and was housed in a modified AJS 7R chassis. Derek Farrant won the 1952 Manx Grand Prix at 88.65 mph, and AMC put the G45 into limited production. In 1953 there was a Clubman range of Matchless/AJS 350 cc and 500 cc singles. AMC withdrew from factory-supported road racing at the end of the 1954 season, following the death of Ike Hatch, and facing fierce competition from the other European bikes. The Matchless G50 single-cylinder racer was made generally available for privateers in 1959, and competed against the Norton Manx. Though its 90.0 x 78.0 mm 50 bhp engine and top speed near 135 mph (217 km/h) were slightly down on the Manx, the lighter Matchless could take the day on tight and twisty circuits. In 1958 the Matchless/AJS road bikes were joined by a 250 cc and in 1960 by a 350 cc for a lightweight series of singles. In 1960 Bert Hopwood resigned from AMC and joined Triumph. That same year AMC posted a profit of a little over ¬£200,000, in comparison to BSA's ¬£3.5 million. That was followed by a loss of ¬£350,000 in 1961. With the closure of the Norton plant at Birmingham in 1962 and the merger of Norton and Matchless production, the future was beginning to look rather bleak. In the sixties, with sales declining AMC made the commercial decision to focus on the Norton twins and the Matchless/AJS singles but they were not to be successful and the factory ceased production shortly afterwards. With the G15 line, AMC built on the merits of the G12 but there were numerous changes to frame, forks, swinging arm, primary chaincase, transmission, cycle parts and lubrication system. The P11 was the last line of bikes with bonds to AMC. It used a modified G85CS frame but there were stronger forks, completely new cycle parts (making some was rather costly), altered lubrication and modified primary chaincases, to mention a few. The G15 series was offered as 3 brands: Matchless G15 comprising G15Mk2, G15CS and G15CSR; AJS Model 33 comprising M33Mk2, M33CS and M33CSR; and last not least Norton N15CS (no Norton-branded roadster made as it would compete against the Atlas). The G15 series was produced from 1963 to 1969. They were initially for export only, but by 1965 these models were available in UK and Europe too. The Matchless G85CS used a 12:1 compression 500 cc with an improved bottom end, and a Norton gear-driven oil pump replacing the old reciprocating design that dated back to the 1920s. MA 1958 500 cc AJS 18CS Scrambler (Retrieved 25 October 2006) The revised bottom end was introduced for 1964 and is shared by 350/500 roadsters and the 500CS (G80CS and M18CS), the engine of which was later adapted to the G85CS. The new lubrication system helped lubricating the big end and piston as well as the top end on the high-performance singles. The G85CS was further tuned for 1966, and received a new piston providing a CR of 12.5:1. An Amal GP carburettor was standard fitting, making the bike difficult to start. Maximum power rose to 41 bhp @ 6,500 rpm. Matchless/AJS built predictable handling, comfortable, well-made, reliable and economical motorcycles, for their day. Unfortunately such attributes were not enough to keep them in business. Continuing poor sales led to AMC becoming part of a new company, called Norton-Villiers in 1966. = Norton Villiers (1966‚Äì73) = In 1966 Associated Motorcycles went bankrupt and was taken over by Manganese Bronze Holdings, who formed Norton-Villiers to oversee operations. At the time Norton was the only motorcycle marque in the company that was making money. There was a P11 series which comprised the following four models; P11 (1967), P11A (1968) and P11A Ranger (1968/69) and the P11 Ranger 750 (1969). It is believed that production of the G15 series was halted late in 1968 (model year '69) with unsold samples on offer through 1969. The P11 series carried on in production until the spring of 1969. The P11 was offered either as Norton or Matchless, but by heritage it is a Matchless bike. = Les Harris (1987) = A new Harris \\"Matchless G80\\" single was released in 1987 powered by an Austrian Rotax 4-stroke, single over-head cam (SOHC), 500 cc engine. Components from Italy such as front and rear Paioli suspension and Brembo disc brakes were used whilst, harking back to his licence-built Triumph Bonneville T140s, the frame doubled up as the oil tank. The model was offered in colours of silver, black or metallic burgundy. Although electric start and twin disc brakes were options, priced at ¬£2700 (¬£500 more than a Yamaha motorcycle of similar specification), this was not a successful product and production ended by the early 1990s.

Best known as a counter top surfacing material, laminate is a durable decorative veneer applied to cabinetry, furniture, and other horizontal and vertical surfaces. The original Arborite material was developed in 1942 by the Howard Smith Paper Company as an innovative way to utilize waste by-products of the Canadian papermaking industry, and to this day laminate is commonly referred to in Canada by the trade name Arborite.  What is laminate? (HPL)  Laminate is a material made by bonding layers of material or materials. Laminate, in technical terminology, is referred to as High Pressure Laminate (HPL) or even more accurately as High Pressure Decorative Plastic Laminate since there are also industrial high pressure laminates which are not decorative. The decorative high pressure laminates in our homes and offices, etc. consist of sheets of paper that have been coated or impregnated with two types of resin, stacked on top of each other and placed into a press where they are cooked at a minimum of 265 degrees F. at a pressure of approximately 1,200 pounds per square inch (psi) for about an hour. Under this pressure and heat the resins flow, transforming the stack and the resins into a single sheet of homogenous composite material. \\"Plastic\\" laminate is a misleading term because the material is approximately 70% paper and 30% polymer (phenolic and melamine) resin.  History  The Howard Smith Paper Company was founded in 1912 by C. Howard Smith (1873 ‚Äì 1931) in an abandoned cotton mill in Beauharnois, Qu√©bec, Canada on the shores of Lake St. Louis. By 1914, this one-machine mill was in high production, churning out rag paper. In 1916, Howard Smith acquired the newsprint business of Edwin Crabtree in Crabtree Mills, Quebec, and by 1919, they had also purchased the Toronto Paper Company Limited of Cornwall, Ontario. Over the next 20 years, Howard Smith would acquire an additional four paper companies in various locations across Canada, and expand the operations at each of the facilities. Howard Smith Paper Company was committed to the conservation of Canada's forests and the sustainability of their source material. In 1937, for their 25th anniversary, the company published a history called \\"25 Years of Progress\\"; in it, President Harold Crabtree's mission statement states, \\"Our aim, primarily, is that of serving the Canadian trade with quality papers at fair prices, conserving the forest wealth of Canada, from which we draw our raw materials, not only to the end that our vast operations may be served for the immediate future, but that future generations, too, may have the same privileges and enjoyment of these forests as ourselves.\\" Edmund Howard Smith, the son of C. Howard and Alice Young Day, followed his father in the family business. He was born and raised in Montreal, Qu√©bec and trained as an industrialist at McGill University. After graduation, he worked his way up in his father's company, from a business clerk to president of the Howard Smith Paper Company in 1946. Both Edmund Howard and his father held the position of President of the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association at various points in their careers. Edmund was convinced that waste from the paper making process could be transformed into a useful product in its own right. He began working with fellow McGill graduate Dr. George Tomlinson II, the chief of research and development at Howard Smith Paper; his father, Dr. George Tomlinson Sr, had previously been in the same position at Howard Smith and while there had patented the ingenious Tomlinson recovery boiler. For four years, these two young men spearheaded experiments to develop a process for separating and extracting lignin from kraft black liquor, a by-product of paper making; in 1946 Smith and Tomlinson were awarded a patent for the resulting material, which they named \\"Arborite\\". Though it is not recorded how they arrived at that name, likely is because ‚Äòarbor‚Äô is the Latin word for tree, and the fact that the parent company was a paper manufacturer concerned about the welfare of the Canadian forests from which their trees were sourced. Production presses were established and a company was formed. Edmund Howard Smith went on to become Arborite's first president, with George Tomlinson Jr. as his chief engineer. Arborite was the first commercial decorative melamine laminate. The manufacturing facility was opened in 1948 in LaSalle, Quebec, where it still is to this day. By early 1949, Arborite was being advertised as the \\"only all- Canadian\\" laminate on the market, available in 35 \\"solid colors, as well as a series of five colored fabric designs, two tones of \\"marble\\" and a wide variety of simulated wood grains.\\"  Residential  Arborite was originally marketed not to design or construction firms, but directly to housewives looking for a \\"modern surfacing material\\". One of the new material's first marketing platforms was the popular Chatelaine ladies‚Äô home magazine, where it was touted as being \\"tested and approved by the Chatelaine Institute\\". By the early 1950s, Arborite was available in more than 60 colors and patterns, mostly solid colors and wood grains. In 1954, Western Woods built 10 trend houses across Canada, representing the epitome in modern design and materials. Arborite was chosen for kitchen and bathroom surfaces in many of these model homes. 1958 saw the introduction of new lines of pastel Glitter and Metallic Tone laminates, closely followed by Stardust (a random breakup pattern) and Fantasy (abstract mid-century stars). Woodgrain patterns at this time included Sliced Walnut, Fawn English Walnut and Blond Persian Walnut. By 1962, Arborite had branched into the United Kingdom. This is from Design magazine in 1965: \\"Arborite decorative laminates only appeared in Britain in 1960, but already they have radically effected the decorative laminates scene here. The company established its name with its woodgrains and marbles, and has recently launched the most comprehensive plain colour range on the British market, as well as issuing an architectural manual.\\" Then, in 1963, came one of the most pivotal changes in the history of the company. Howard Smith Paper Mills Ltd. was acquired by Domtar Inc, one of the largest manufacturing enterprises in Canada at the time; Arborite was now a division of Domtar Construction materials. In the merger, Dr. George Tomlinson II was retained by Domtar as the Director of Research. He went on to have an over-thirty-year history with the company, and won the TAPPI (Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry) medal in 1969 for his outstanding contributions to lignin chemistry and pulping technology. By the 1980s, Dr. Tomlinson was semi-retired but was still an advisor/consultant for Domtar, publishing articles and books about the effects of acid rain on the forests of North America‚Äîstill concerned about environmental responsibility in the paper industry.  Commercial  The 1970s saw a shift in marketing, from the residential market to a more corporate focus. Arborite was advertised as \\"An excellent choice for architects, designers and furniture manufacturers alike.\\" Over 140 patterns and colors were available at this point, including East Indian Teak and Black Leather, with \\"new Metallic and Fabric laminates\\". Many of the 52 solid colors could be seen as epitomizing the decade, from Bitter Lemon and Dusty Olive, to Pale Avocado and Minton Blue. Application locations of Arborite laminate included McGill University, high-end hotels, corporate offices and private, architect- designed residences, and Canadian Pacific rail car interiors.

Dominican amber differentiates itself from Baltic amber by being nearly always transparent, and it has a higher number of fossil inclusions. This has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long-vanished tropical forest.George Poinar, Jr. and Roberta Poinar, 1999. The Amber Forest: A Reconstruction of a Vanished World, (Princeton University Press)  Age  A study in the early 1990s returned a date up to 40 million years old. However, according to Poinar, Dominican amber dates from Oligocene to Miocene, thus about 25 million years old. The oldest, and hardest of this amber comes from the mountain region north of Santiago. The La Cumbre, La Toca, Palo Quemado, La Bucara, and Los Cacaos mining sites in the Cordillera Septentrional not far from Santiago. Amber has also been found in the south-eastern Bayaguana/Sabana de la Mar area. There is also subfossil copal found in the Cotui deposits with an age of less than 280 years.Schlee, D. (1984): Notizen √ºber einige Bernsteine und Kopale aus aller Welt. Stuttgarter Beitr. Naturk. Ser. C, 18: 29-47, page 35  Mining sites  There are three main sites in the Dominican Republic where amber is found: La Cordillera Septentrional, in the north, and Bayaguana and Sabana de la Mar, in the east. In the northern area, the amber-bearing unit is formed of clastic rocks, washed down with sandstone fragments and other sediments that accumulated in a deltaic environment, even in water of some depth.Leif Brost and Ake Dahlstrom. The Amber Book, Geoscience Press, Inc., Tucson , AZ, 1996 Wilfred Wichard und Wolfgang Weitschat: Im Bernsteinwald. - Gerstenberg Verlag, Hildesheim, 2004, Baroni Urbani, C. & Saunders, J.B. (1980): The fauna of the Dominican Republic amber: the present status of knowledge. ‚Äì Memorias, 9a geologica del Caribe, 1: 213-223; Santo Domingo. (Published 1983). In the eastern area, the amber is found in a sediment formation of organic-rich laminated sand, sandy clay, intercalated lignite, and as well as some solvated beds of gravel and calcarenite.Schlee, D. (1984): Besonderheiten des Dominikanischen Bernsteins. ‚Äì Stuttgarter Beitr. Naturk., C, 18: 63-71; Stuttgart. Both areas seem to have been part of the same sedimentary basin but were later disrupted by movements along major faults.Manuel A. Iturralde-Vennet 2001. Geology of the Amber-Bearing Deposits of the Greater Antilles. Caribbean Journal of Science, Vol. 00, No. 0, 141-167, 2001  Mining  Dominican amber, especially Dominican blue amber, is mined through bell pitting, which is extremely dangerous. The bell pit is basically a foxhole dug with whatever tools are available. Machetes do the start, some shovels, picks and hammers may participate eventually. The pit itself goes as deep or safe as possible, sometimes vertical, sometimes horizontal, but never level. It snakes into hill sides, drops away, joins up with others, goes straight up and pops out elsewhere. 'Foxhole' applies indeed: rarely are the pits large enough to stand in, and then only at the entrance. Miners crawl around on their knees using short-handled picks, shovels and machetes. There are little to no safety measures. A pillar or so may hold back the ceiling from time to time but only if the area has previously collapsed. Candles are the only source of light. Humidity inside the mines is at 100%. Since the holes are situated high on mountainsides and deep inside said mountains, the temperature is cool and bearable, but after several hours the air becomes stale. During rain the mines are forced to close. The holes fill up quickly with water, and there is little point in pumping it out again (although sometimes this is done) because the unsecured walls may crumble.Mart√≠nez, R. & Schlee, D. (1984): Die Dominikanischen Bernsteinminen der Nordkordillera, speziell auch aus der Sicht der Werkstaetten. ‚Äì Stuttgarter Beitr. Naturk., C, 18: 79-84; Stuttgart.  Variations  Dominican amber can be found in many colors, besides the obvious amber. Yellow and honey colored are fairly common. There is also red and green in smaller quantities and the rare blue amber (fluorescent).Schlee, D. (1980): Bernstein-Raritaeten (Farben, Strukturen, Fossilen, Handwerk). ‚Äì 88 S.

He was primarily a specialist batsman, whose best period as a player came from 1982 to 1985. He is currently the coach of the Oman national cricket team. He was awarded the Deshamanya (Sri Lanka's second-highest national honour) in 1996. Early years He spent his college life at St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa and S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. Mendis also captained the Under 20 1st XI side of his college. International career Mendis made his debut for Sri Lanka in 1972, batting at number three against the visiting Tamil Nadu side. Mendis top-scored in the first innings with 52, and also made 34 in the second innings, but could not prevent an innings defeat. This match did not have international status, and indeed Mendis represented Sri Lanka in a number of non-internationals. His first ODI, however, came in 1975, when he made 8 against the West Indies in a batting collapse. It took seven more years before Mendis got to play a Test match; on 17 February 1982 he joined forces with the other Sri Lankans against England. In that match, he was sent in to bat at number four, but only made 17 and 27 in Sri Lanka's seven-wicket defeat. More defeats followed, and in his first eight innings he only recorded one fifty, in the first Test of three against Pakistan. However, on tour of India in the northern autumn of 1982 he showed his real skill. Sri Lanka had lost two early wickets for 11 runs, and Mendis was sent in to bat with Roy Dias. Their partnership was worth 153 runs, then a third-wicket record for Sri Lanka, and Mendis' maiden century helped Sri Lanka bat out the first day. Then, India amassed 566 for 6 before declaring, leaving Sri Lanka to try to save the draw. Again, the openers fell for single-digit scores, and again Mendis made 105 ‚Äì which helped Sri Lanka bat until tea on the fifth day. Sri Lanka eventually drew the Test, their first drawn Test series in their history. In the 1983 Cricket World Cup, Mendis recorded his third One Day International fifty (the previous two came in the 1979 World Cup and on tour to Pakistan in 1982). However, despite a respectable batting average of 25.33, Mendis' fortunes were the reverse of the Sri Lankan side. Sri Lanka lost the games in which he made reasonable scores, while Mendis made a duck in Sri Lanka's only win. Mendis recorded a string of poor scores on New Zealand's tour of the island in 1984, only passing 20 once in six Test innings. By this time, however, he was established as the captain of the side, and still picked for the Test match in England that English summer. Mendis made his third Test century as Sri Lanka smashed 491 for 7 batting first amid the rain, and the first Test century by a Sri Lankan captain while in office. Sri Lanka drew that Test. A poor World Series Cup in 1984‚Äì85 followed, where Sri Lanka only won one out of ten ODIs, and Mendis was out in single figures four times. Then came the 1985 Indian tour. Mendis led from the front, scoring three fifties and one series-saving century in the third Test, as India were defeated 1‚Äì0 in three Tests. After that tour, which also included a drawn ODI series, Mendis' career declined, and by the end of his career it was probably only his captaincy that kept him in. He made two Test fifties in his last ten Tests, and two ODI fifties in his last 32 ODIs following the India tour. Ranjan Madugalle replaced him as captain for the very last Test that Mendis played, where he bowed out with a rearguard 56 that was, however, not to be good enough to save a draw. He remained within the Sri Lankan cricketing sphere, however, as he was manager of the successful 1996 Cricket World Cup side. Later on he went on to coach the Oman cricket Team and helped them qualify for their first 2016 World T20 in 2015. Duleep Mendis is the only Sri Lankan cricketer to score a test century in Chennai at MA Chidambaram Stadium and he done it twice in a same test (scoring 105 & 105 in the same test in each innings) References * CricketArchive ‚Äì First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Duleep Mendis * External links *A man of many \\"firsts\\" and an ornament to Cricket Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Sinhalese Sports Club cricketers Category:Sri Lanka One Day International cricketers Category:Sri Lanka Test cricketers Category:Sri Lankan cricketers Category:Sri Lanka Test cricket captains Category:Cricketers at the 1975 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 1979 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 1983 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 1987 Cricket World Cup Category:Sportspeople from Moratuwa Category:Alumni of S.

The purpose of IONM is to reduce the risk to the patient of iatrogenic damage to the nervous system, and/or to provide functional guidance to the surgeon and anesthesiologist. Methods Neuromonitoring employs various electrophysiologic modalities, such as extracellular single unit and local field recordings, SSEP, transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials (TCeMEP), EEG, EMG, and auditory brainstem response (ABR). For a given surgery, the set of modalities used depends in part on which neural structures are at risk. Transcranial Doppler imaging (TCDI) is also becoming more widely used to detect vascular emboli. TCDI can be used in tandem with EEG during vascular surgery. IONM techniques have significantly reduced the rates of morbidity and mortality without introducing additional risks. By doing so, IONM techniques reduce health care costs. To accomplish these objectives, a member of the surgical team with special training in neurophysiology obtains and co-interprets triggered and spontaneous electrophysiologic signals from the patient periodically or continuously throughout the course of the operation. Patients who benefit from neuromonitoring are those undergoing operations involving the nervous system or which pose risk to its anatomic or physiologic integrity. In general, a trained neurophysiologist attaches a computer system to the patient using stimulating and recording electrodes. Interactive software running on the system carries out two tasks: #selective activation of stimulating electrodes with appropriate timing, and #processing and displaying of the electrophysiologic signals as they are picked up by the recording electrodes. The neurophysiologist can thus observe and document the electrophysiologic signals in realtime in the operating area during the surgery. The signals change according to various factors, including anesthesia, tissue temperature, surgical stage, and tissue stresses. Various factors exert their influence on the signals with various tissue-dependent timecourses. Differentiating the signal changes along these lineswith particular attention paid to stressesis the joint task of the surgical triad: surgeon, anesthesiologist, and neurophysiologist. Surgical procedures Patients benefit from neuromonitoring during certain surgical procedures, namely any surgery where there is risk to the nervous system. Most neuromonitoring is utilized by spine surgeons, but neurosurgeons, vascular, orthopedic, otolaryngologists, and urology surgeons have all utilized neuromonitoring as well. The most common applications are in spinal surgery; selected brain surgeries; carotid endarterectomy; ENT procedures such as acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwanoma) resection, parotidectomy; and nerve surgery. Motor evoked potentials have also been used in surgery for Thoracic aortic aneurysm. Intraoperative monitoring is used to : * to localize neural structures, for example to locate cranial nerves during skull base surgery; * to test function of these structures; and * for early detection of intraoperative neural injury, allowing for immediate corrective measures. For example, during any surgery on the thoracic or cervical spinal column, there is some risk to the spinal cord. Since the 1970s, SSEP (somatosensory evoked potentials) have been used to monitor spinal cord function by stimulating a nerve distal to the surgery, and recording from the cerebral cortex or other locations rostral to the surgery. A baseline is obtained, and if there are no significant changes, the assumption is that the spinal cord has not been injured. If there is a significant change, corrective measures can be taken; for example, the hardware can be removed. More recently, transcranial electric motor evoked potentials (TCeMEP) have also been used for spinal cord monitoring. This is the reverse of SSEP; the motor cortex is stimulated transcranially, and recordings made from muscles in the limbs, or from spinal cord caudal to the surgery. This allows direct monitoring of motor tracts in the spinal cord. EEG electroencephalography is used for monitoring of cerebral function in neurovascular cases (cerebral aneurysms, carotid endarterectomy) and for defining tumor margins in epilepsy surgery and some cerebral tumors. EEG measures taken during anesthesia exhibit stereotypic changes as anesthetic depth increases. These changes include complex patterns of waves with frequency slowing accompanied by amplitude increases which typically peak when loss of consciousness occurs (loss of responses to verbal commands; loss of righting reflex). As anesthetic depth increases from light surgical levels to deep anesthesia, the EEG exhibits disrupted rhythmic waveforms, high amplitude burst suppression activity, and finally, very low amplitude isoelectric or 'flat line' activity. Various signal analysis approaches have been used to quantify these pattern changes and can provide an indication of loss of recall, loss of consciousness and anesthetic depth. Monitors have been developed using various algorithms for signal analysis and are commercially available, but none have as yet proven 100% accurate. This is a difficult problem and an active area of medical research. EMG is used for cranial nerve monitoring in skull base cases and for nerve root monitoring and testing in spinal surgery. ABR (a.k.a. BSEP, BSER, BAEP, etc.) is used for monitoring of the acoustic nerve during acoustic neuroma and brainstem tumor resections. Licensure, certification, credentialing, and evidence In the US, IONM licensure has not been legislated at the state or federal level. Issues of licensure are discussed in ASET's 68-page white paper on occupational regulation.ASET's White Paper on Occupation Regulation Worldwide, there are at least two private certifications available: CNIM (Certified in Neurophysiological Intraoperative Monitoring) and D.ABNM (Diplomate of the American Board of Neurophysiological Monitoring). Though not governmentally regulated, certain health care facilities have internal regulations pertaining to neuromonitoring certifications (see below). The CNIM is a more widely known credential throughout the United States. The Certification for Neurophysiological Intraoperative Monitoring (CNIM) is awarded by the American Board of Electroencephalographic and Evoked Potential Technologists. As of 2010, minimum requirements include 1) a B.A., B.S. [Path 2] 2) R.EP.T or R.EEG.T Credential [Path 1] 3) A minimum of 150 surgeries. Path 1 is a 200 question exam costing $600. Path 2 is a 250-question exam. A 4-hour multiple-choice computer-based exam is offered twice a year. Currently, there are a little over 3500 board certified clinicians. Audiologists may received board certification in neurophysiological intraoperative monitoring via AABIOM. The exam has 200 multiple choice questions covering 6 areas: Anesthesia, Neuroscience, Instrumentation, Electro-physiology, Human physiology / anatomy, Surgical Applications.AABIOM FAQ Retrieved 24 January 2017. There are several organisations that certify MDs in the field including the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (www.acns.org) and the American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine. The optimal practice model is under discussion at the present time (2013) as is the relevant qualifications for supervision. Outside the US there many different styles of IOM. The evidence- based support for IOM is growing. There is a debate over whether IOM required controlled studies such as randomized trials, or whether expert consensus suffices.

The Minera Limeworks were extensive lime quarries and kilns at Minera in Wrexham, Wales. It was located at , near the villages of Gwynfryn, Minera, and Coedpoeth and was locally referred to as The Calch. History The Minera Limeworks were once the largest lime workings in the north of Wales. Limeburning at Minera is recorded from as early as 1620 but the Minera Lime Company was established in 1852. The total output from the Minera area quarries was estimated, in 1859, to be around 300,000 tons, with 200,000 tons of this converted to lime. The Minera Lime Company became a limited company in 1865, and this prompted some heavy cash injection into the works. Using this money, the company erected a \\"Hoffmann kiln\\". Originally destined for brickmaking, it was soon converted to limeburning. This kiln still exists and is one of three that were purpose- built for lime burning left in the UK: another is located at Langcliffe in Yorkshire, another is located at Llanymynech Limeworks. The quarries had their own steam locomotive and hundred of open coal wagons and closed lime wagons at its peak. Hornby Railways and Dapol both have model wagons detailing the Minera Lime Co. It also had extensive kilns, still there to this day. The works closed in 1972 and the Wrexham and Minera Branch railway lines were pulled up at around the same time. Current usage Blasting and quarrying of limestone, used for road building materials, continued at the site until 1993. For many years since closure, the quarry served as storage for road building materials, and a tipple for them was built, but was soon abandoned. In 2004-05 the quarry was subject to a cleanup operation, where all the materials were taken and the whole area flattened. Tarmac (a supplier of materials to the building trade) who had taken interest in the site took several core samples and found the quarry to still be a viable source of lime. Lafarge Aggregates owned the site until recently, following their take over of Redland plc and erected large amounts of fencing around most of the site as well as signage advising to stick to signed footpaths, restricting movement around the quarry for health and safety purposes. Lafarge had no interest in resuming quarrying operations at the site here. The Minera Quarry Trust negotiated with Lafarge about the future of the site. Minera Quarry Trust was established in 2005 with the explicit aim of conserving the former quarry site for the benefit of the public. Since then the trust has made significant progress in developing a plan of action for the site that encompasses both short term improvements and long term sustainability for the site. The Trust worked in partnership with North Wales Wildlife Trust to develop the project and received political endorsement from Wrexham County Borough Council. North Wales Wildlife Trust purchased the site for ¬£1 from Tarmac, who also donated ¬£100,000 so work could be carried out to make the site safe for public access. . The site was officially opened on 2 June 2018 by Mike Dilger as their 36th Wildlife Reserve in North Wales.

He was born in Whitby to a military family and as the son of an admiral, he trained at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, becoming a captain in the 52nd regiment. After assisting Robert Stephenson he created railway lines in England, Belgium, Germany and Ceylon.  Early life and career  Moorsom was the youngest of the four sons of Admiral Sir Robert Moorsom, who had served at the Trafalgar, and his wife Eleanor.Jehanne Wake, Kleinwort, Benson: the history of two families in banking, p.89, accessed 18 November 2008 He entered the Royal Military College in 1819, and became especially adept in fortification and military surveying. In 1823 he joined the 79th Highlanders Regiment, then stationed in Ireland. During his stay there, he made a survey of Dublin and its neighbourhood, which remained in use until it was superseded by the publication of the Ordnance Survey. In 1825 he served in the Mediterranean as a lieutenant in the 7th Fusiliers. In 1826 he transferred to the 69th Regiment, and then to the 52nd Light Infantry in Nova Scotia.1864 \\"Obituary Captain William Scarth Moorsom, 1804-1863.\\" Institution of Civil Engineers: Minutes of the Proceedings, Volume 23, pages 498 ‚Äì504 During this time he served as deputy quartermaster-general. He produced a survey of the harbour and environs of Halifax, along with reports on transport feasibility to all parts of the province, and published a monograph Letters From Nova Scotia; comprising Sketches of a Young Country in 1830. Although he was highly regarded he was unable to purchase a suitable promotion so returned to England and bought out his commission in 1832. He had met his wife, Isabella Ann Morris, daughter of Lewis Wilkins, judge and head of the supreme court, in Nova Scotia. They lived with his father at Cosgrove Priory, near Stony Stratford, until his death in April 1835.  Railway engineer  With his experience of military surveying, Moorsom assisted in the construction of the London and Birmingham Railway construction of which had begun in 1833 and of which his eldest brother, Constantine Richard Moorsom was Secretary to the Board. Moorsom's survey of the valley of the Ouse allowed the railway line to be straightened, and eliminated the need for a large embankment. This feat attracted the attention of Robert Stephenson. He then spent two years studying new railway lines all over the country and in 1836 undertook a survey of the country between Birmingham and Gloucester in order to build a railway. The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway had found Brunel's proposals out of its financial reach. Moorsom's brief in 1836 was to build the line as cheaply as possible, which he did by following open country, thereby avoiding populated areas where land prices were higher. Arriving at the Lickey Hills there was no option but to climb, using cable assistance if necessary. From experience gained observing mineral railways in the north, Moorsom preferred locomotives. The general opinion at that time was that adhesion was not possible on such a steep incline and so the directors of the company set out to buy stationary engines for cable-haulage. They found the cost prohibitive; so, Moorsom was allowed to continue what was thought to be a considerable gamble. The resulting Lickey Incline has entered railway folklore. Since no English manufacturer would, or could, supply him, he ordered 4-2-0 locomotives from Norris of Philadelphia in the United States. The loco they supplied had driving wheels, cylinder bore of , and stroke, weighing Moorsom was also awarded the Telford Medal for his method of using iron caissons filled with concrete and masonry to form the foundations of a three-arch viaduct across the River Avon, near Tewkesbury. In passing, one of his assistants was Herbert Spencer. F. R. Conder was critical of Moorsom's management style and engineering abilities in his Personal Recollections of English Engineers (1868)F. R. Conder, Personal recollections of English engineers, and of the introduction of the railway system into the United Kingdom (1868); repr. as J. Simmons, ed., The men who built railways (1983) in Chrimes 2004 Spencer was less recriminatory in his Autobiography (1904),H. Spencer, An autobiography, 1 (1904), 140‚Äì86 in Chrimes (2004) describing Moorsom as a kind man, although he felt that he had treated some subordinates meanly. Chrimes Mike Chrimes, 'Moorsom, William Scarth (1804‚Äì1863)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [ 19158, accessed 19 Jan 2008 suggests that his problems may have been \\"due to the financial pressures of bringing up a large family, combined with working for companies which had limited financial resources.\\" The period of 1844‚Äì45 proved to be especially busy with new lines from Birmingham to Wolverhampton, Shrewsbury, Newton, and Chester,; the Yarmouth Junction, from Diss and Beccles, the Irish Great Western, from Naas, by Tullamore, to Galway, the Metropolitan Counties Junction, from Gravesend, by Reigate, Dorking, Weybridge, Staines, Rickmansworth, St. Albans, Chelmsford, and Billericay to Tilbury, the London, Hammersmith, Staines, and Windsor, 25 miles, and several smaller lines. The Southampton and Dorchester Railway in 1847 was notable as \\"Castleman' Corkscrew\\": its promoters insisted that it should serve as many of the local communities as possible. At this time, Moorsom surveyed the line from Exeter and Plymouth to Falmouth, the West Cornwall Railway, from Truro to Penzance. In 1845 he was in Ireland working on the Waterford and Kilkenny Railway. Of note was a timber viaduct over the River Nore, in height and of span, at the time the largest of its type in the British Isles. Though the design was not used, he won the Prussian government's engineering prize in 1850 for his design for a bridge to cross the Rhine at Cologne on the line from Prussia's Rhine Province to Antwerp in Belgium for the K√∂niglich Preu√üische und Gro√üherzoglich Hessische Staatseisenbahn (K.P.u.G.H.St.E.). For the next four years there was a general retraction of the industry and in 1852 Moorsom became involved with the Britannia and Baltimore Mining Company to prospect for and mine gold in the United Kingdom. Although some gold was produced it was not enough to make the company viable. During this period he was appointed engineer to the Cromford and High Peak Railway which was in deep financial difficulty. In 1857 the Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway was opened, with a proposal to link with the Cromford line.Hodgkins, D.J., (1983) Captain Moorsom and the Attempt to Revive the Cromford and High Peak Railway, Derbyshire Archaeological Journal Vol 103 Pp 137‚Äë159 Plans were laid to capitalise on this by substantially improving the line. The necessary funds were not forthcoming, however, and there was opposition from other railway companies. The C&HPR; and Moorsom parted company in about 1856. Over the years Moorsom had gained the reputation of taking on too many projects, and some of his surveys were also found wanting. He was frequently replaced by other engineers, and found it difficult to obtain work. In 1856 he was asked to survey the railway from Kandy to Colombo Ceylon (Sri Lanka). Under pressure to complete the work before the rainy season, he began early in January, and presented his report in May, and part of the work proved to be faulty.  Last years  In 1860, Moorsom's wife Isabella died and, in 1862 he was Engineer with the Ringwood, Christchurch and Bournemouth Railway He had been elected an Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers, on 24 March 1835, and was transferred to the class of Members on 20 February 1849. Among a number of papers that he read was, in 1852, Description of the viaduct erected over the river Nore, near Thomastown . He became a Member of the Society of Arts on 31 January 1843. He occupied his retirement by writing a history of his regiment and died of cancer, after a long and painful illness, at his home, 17A Great George Street, Westminster, on 3 June 1863, aged 61, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.

Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 1 in D minor, his Op. 13, was composed between January and October 1895 at his Ivanovka estate near Tambov, Russia. Despite its poor initial reception, the symphony is now seen as a dynamic representation of the Russian symphonic tradition, with British composer Robert Simpson calling it \\"a powerful work in its own right, stemming from Borodin and Tchaikovsky, but convinced, individual, finely constructed, and achieving a genuinely tragic and heroic expression that stands far above the pathos of his later music.\\"Simpson, The Symphony, 2:129-30. The premiere, which took place in St. Petersburg on March 28, 1897, was an absolute disaster for reasons which included under-rehearsal and the poor performance of the conductor Alexander Glazunov. Rachmaninoff subsequently suffered a psychological collapsesometimes attributed to the 1897 premiere, but the circumstances are probably much more complicated but did not destroy or attempt to disown the score.Bertenssohn and Leyva, 144-145; Norris, Rachmaninoff, 97. It was left in Russia when he went into exile in 1917 and subsequently lost.Norris, Rachmaninoff, 23. In 1944, after the composer's death, the separate instrumental parts of the symphony were discovered and were used to reconstruct the full score. The symphony's second performance took place at the Moscow Conservatory on October 17, 1945, conducted by Aleksandr Gauk. Following a general reassessment of Rachmaninoff's music, the First Symphony has been performed frequently and recorded several times.Harrison, 82. Background The Moscow Conservatory, where Rachmaninoff graduated with honors in the spring of 1891. The First Symphony was actually Rachmaninoff's second attempt in the genre. During 1890‚Äì91, his final year at the Moscow Conservatory, he had been assigned by one of his composition teachers, Anton Arensky, to write a symphony as an exercise. Rachmaninoff later told biographer Oskar von Riesmann that he had completed the work; however, three of the four movements subsequently vanished. The single surviving movement, approximately 12 minutes in length, was published posthumously in 1947 as Rachmaninoff's Youth Symphony. This student work is written in traditional sonata form and modeled after the opening movement of Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony. Rachmaninoff added that neither Arensky nor fellow-professor Sergei Taneyev was enthusiastic about the work, perhaps because of its lack of individuality.Harrison, 33‚Äî34. The First Piano Concerto, which he wrote later in 1891, showed a better indication of his ability to handle large-scale musical forces,Harrison, 36. and his transcription (1894) of Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony into a piano duet gave him further exposure to the symphonic genre.Harrison, 63. Composition Portrait of Mitrofan Belyayev by Ilya Repin (1886) Rachmaninoff began planning what would become his First Symphony in September 1894, after he had finished orchestrating his Caprice Boh√©mien.Norris, Rachmaninoff, 20. He composed the symphony between January and October 1895, which was an unusually long time for Rachmaninoff to spend on a composition; the project had proved to be extremely challenging. Writing from Ivanovka on July 29, he complained that despite seven-hour days, progress was exceptionally slow. Those daily work schedules had increased to ten hours a day by September, and the symphony was completed and orchestrated before Rachmaninoff left Ivanovka on October 7.Harrison, 67. The atypical length of time Rachmaninoff had needed to compose the symphony was followed by delays in getting it performed. In 1895 he had met the musical philanthropist Mitrofan Belyayev, whose interest in programming a piece of Rachmaninoff's music had led to a performance of the tone poem The Rock at the Russian Symphony Concerts in St. Petersburg.Harrison, 67-68. In 1896, encouraged by Taneyev and Glazunov, Belyayev agreed to program Rachmaninoff's symphony the following year.Norris, Rachmaninoff, 21. However, when Rachmaninoff played the symphony at the piano for Taneyev, the elder composer complained: \\"These melodies are flabby, colorless ‚Äì there is nothing that can be done with them.\\"Bertenssohn and Leyva, 70. Rachmaninoff made numerous changes to the score, but was still dissatisfied. After further advice from Taneyev he made further amendments, including expansion of the slow movement.Harrison, 68  Description  The symphony is scored for 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in B, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in B, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, bass drum (movements 1, 2 and 4 only), triangle (movements 2 and 4 only), snare drum, tambourine, tam-tam (movement 4 only) and strings. A typical performance has an approximate duration of 45 minutes. = Grave‚ÄîAllegro non troppo (D minor) = A short introduction (just seven bars), gives the tone to the work: strong fierce, and brave. In it two motivic items are presented which will establish the cyclic material for the entire composition: a note cell preceded by a grupetto and theme derived from the medieval Dies Irae plainchant. The latter becomes the prevailing theme in the Allegro, developed and enriched by orchestral figures based on Tchaikovsky. The second theme (Moderato), in the violins, is interesting in its melodic structure, which uses the gypsy scale (with two augmented seconds). It is also harmonically unusual because of its ambiguous tonality. This theme is repeated by the whole orchestra in a sudden and powerful fortissimo, which leads to the first theme climaxing in a brass chorale. At the beginning of the repetition, the cell-grupetto reappears insistently.Tranchefort, 919. = Allegro animato (D minor) = The second movement is a fantastic scherzo which also begins with the cell-grupetto as well as a reminiscence of the Dies Irae, at least its first notes. The movement's main theme is a short melody, that we hear alternatively under its original form and its inversion, but the latter only appears briefly and episodically, spaced out by call signals and shudders of the orchestra which constitute an expressive background. In the central part, the cell-grupetto comes back again, giving birth to a new theme which is repeated by a solo violin for a few bars, in a gypsy air. = Larghetto (B‚ô≠ major) = In the lyric calm of this movement, even the grupetto seems to have lost its menacing tension. The clarinet sings an easy and soft melody, but in the middle some storms appear with the gloomy harmonies of the muted horns. The theme, repeated, is ornamented with repetitive appoggiatura and counterpoint. = Allegro con fuoco (D major) = The cell-grupetto again gives the final movement a faltering violence. The brass instruments and a march rhythm start a theme based, once more, on the Dies Irae. A calm con anima passage follows with a melody in the violins which goes quickly to high notes. Brass instruments take a prominent role followed by a new change in the central part (Allegro mosso), introduced by repeated notes in the low strings. The rhythm is especially interesting, with its soft syncopation (related to a binary rhythm in a ternary bar): repeated accompaniment from the scherzo appears in the second part and the return of the grupetto relaunches the movement with its dynamic and orchestral violence. A tam-tam hit follows the coda, at the end of which the grupetto, played by the strings in a slower time, is repeated with a prophetic insistence, strengthened by the brass and percussion instruments. Despite the uneven quality of the composition itself, there is no doubt that the First Symphony is powerful and dramatic. It is influenced by Tchaikovsky's last symphonies, although this influence can only be seen in the feeling of anguish against relentless fate.  Form  The composer Robert Simpson regarded Rachmaninoff's First Symphony as much superior to the two that followed it, feeling that it had been created \\"naturally and without strain\\" on the wholeSimpson, 129. and with all four of its movements \\"thematically genuinely integrated.\\"Simpson, 130. He also felt the symphony sidesteps what he called the \\"lyrical inflation\\" and \\"forced climaxes\\" of the Second Symphony and the piano concertos. Instead of this lyric inflation, as Robert Walker pointed out, a person could chart an increasing brevity and concision in Rachmaninoff's orchestral compositions in the works he completed after graduating from the Moscow Conservatory‚Äîin other words, from Prince Rostislav to The Rock and from The Rock to the symphony.Walker, 31. Simpson essentially agreed about this musical economy, commenting that the symphony's structure as a whole could not be faulted. While Rachmaninoff did have a habit of relaxing into a slower tempo with the second subject of his first movement (a habit at which, Simpson claimed, Rachmaninoff became much worse later in his career), he kept a firm grip on the corresponding material in this work. Simpson especially cited the last movement's climax as overwhelmingly powerful and extremely economical in the use of its musical material. Znamenny notation with so-called \\"red marks\\", Russia, 1884. \\"Thy Cross we honour, oh Lord, and Thy holy Resurrection we praise.\\" Rachmaninoff biographer Max Harrison writes, \\"The most original element in this work comes from a network of motivic relationships,\\" adding that while the composer had employed this network in his Caprice Boh√©mien, he takes its use still further in the symphony. The result is that, while the symphony is a fully cyclic work, the level of thematic integration is taken far more extensively than in most Russian symphonies. As musicologist Dr. David Brown points out, \\"Themes and thematic fragments from earlier movements are transformed, sometimes profoundly, to help shape existing material as well as to generate new material.\\"Brown, David, ed. Robert Layton, \\"Russia Before the Revolution (1993), 285‚Äì286. In taking the level of thematic integration thus far, Rachmaninoff was able to use comparatively little musical material to combine all four movements. C√©sar Cui may have complained of exactly this quality when he wrote about the \\"meaningless repetition of the same short tricks,\\" but motivic analysts who have since studied the symphony have considered these \\"tricks\\" a compositional strength, not a weakness.Norris, Rachmaninoff, 97. Harrison writes that these same motivic analysts lay claim to the First Symphony as proof \\"that Rachmaninoff could write genuinely symphonic music rather than the ballets squeezed into sonata shapes written by many Russian composers, from Tchaikovsky to Stravinsky.\\"Harrison, 80. Harrison adds that Rachmaninoff's treatment of symphonic form might for this reason be more closely descended from Alexander Borodin, a point the St. Petersburg critics may have either failed to notice or ignored at the work's premiere.Harrison, 80‚Äì81. Another original idea of Rachmaninoff's, as pointed out by Harrison, was his \\"use of Znamenny Chants (–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ä–∞—Å–ø–µ–≤) as the source of thematic ideas.\\"Harrison, 79. While the material Rachmaninoff derives from them occasionally lends a decidedly religious air, he never quotes these chants literally. They resemble what B√©la Bart√≥k would call \\"imaginary folk music\\"‚Äîformally composed music that closely resembles folk music due to his complete absorption of the spirit and musical syntax of Eastern European folk song and dance.Harrison, 79. Some analysts such as Rachmaninoff scholar Geoffrey Norris mention that the symphony also has its problems. The slow movement lapses into a static central episode referring back to the motto theme and the scherzo becomes depleted of rhythmic drive by ramblingly repeating repetitions the same theme. The symphony's clogged and sometimes brash orchestration can make the work sound portentous, though an attentive performance can make the symphony a dark, forceful and rapturous musical statement by helping clarify the orchestration and minimize the potential pitfalls in that area.\\"Norris, Rachmaninoff, 99. First performance =Glazunov= Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, whose own musical preferences in the later years of his career were not overly progressive,Maes, 180‚Äî181. may have sounded an advance warning on hearing the symphony in rehearsal when he told Rachmaninoff, \\"Forgive me, but I do not find this music at all agreeable.\\"Bertenssohn and Leyva, 71. As the elder statesman of Russian music after Tchaikovsky's death, Rimsky-Korsakov may have felt justified saying something to Rachmaninoff, but he may have said it for the wrong reason. By the reports of many present, the rehearsal that Rimsky-Korsakov had heard, conducted by his friend and musical prot√©g√© Glazunov, was both a disaster as a performance and a horrific travesty of the score.Harrison, 76. Though Glazunov loved to conduct, he never totally mastered the craft,Schwarz, New Grove (1980), 7:428. despite Rimsky-Korsakov's claims in his memoirs to the contrary.Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 299. The elder composer's comments on Glazunov's initial appearances as a conductor may in fact have been accurate for this occasion as well: \\"Slow by nature, maladroit and clumsy of movement, the maestro, speaking slowly and in a low voice, manifestly displayed little ability either for conducting rehearsals or for swaying the orchestra during concert performances.\\" Not only did Glazunov conduct badly during the rehearsal of the First Symphony, but he also made cuts in the score and several changes in orchestration.Walker, 37. The cuts he made in the first two movements made little sense musically,Harrison, 82 ft. 4. and his poor use of rehearsal time was complicated by the fact that two other works were receiving their first performances at the same concert.Harrison, 77. Harrison mentions that Rachmaninoff was concerned and tried talking to him during breaks in the rehearsal but to no effect. Glazunov premiered the symphony on March 28 (March 16 o.s.), 1897. The performance was a complete failure; Rachmaninoff himself left in agony before it was over. Conductor Alexander Khessin, who attended the premiere, remembered, \\"The Symphony was insufficiently rehearsed, the orchestra was ragged, basic stability in tempos was lacking, many errors in the orchestral parts were uncorrected; but the chief thing that ruined the work was the lifeless, superficial, bland performance, with no flashes of animation, enthusiasm or brilliance of orchestral sound.\\"Martyn, 97. Moreover, Natalia Satina, who became Rachmaninoff's wife, later claimed, along with other witnesses, that Glazunov may have been drunk on the podium. One person in particular wrote that at the rehearsal he was \\"standing motionless on the conductor's rostrum, wielding his baton without animation.\\"Elena Yulyevna Kreutzer, as quoted in Martyn, 96. Rachmaninoff was obviously very concerned and in the pauses went to Glazunov and said something to him, but he never managed to arouse him from a state of complete indifference. Although Rachmaninoff never echoed this claim of inebriation and the charge itself cannot be confirmed, it is also not implausible considering Glazunov's reputation for alcohol. As reportedly told later by his pupil Dmitri Shostakovich and echoed in the New Grove, Glazunov kept a bottle of alcohol hidden behind his desk at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, sipping it through a tube during lessons.Norris, New Grove, 709. Drunk or not, Glazunov may have neither understood nor been totally committed to the symphony, as it was a composition in a newer, more modern idiom and greater length (approximately 45 minutes) than he might have expected. Nor was he apparently sympathetic to Rachmaninoff's music on the whole, commenting on another occasion, \\"There is a lot of feeling ... but no sense whatever.\\"Seroff, 57. As quoted in Harrison, 77. What makes this comment strange in itself is that Glazunov himself may have anticipated Rachmaninoff's musical style in his own Second Symphony, which he had written in 1886.Harrison, ft. 5. (Glazunov later demonstrated his low regard for Rachmaninoff's music by leaving a copy of the score for the Fourth Piano Concerto in a Paris taxicab in 1930. The score had been a present from the composer.Wooldridge, 266.) Nevertheless, it might be surprising that Glazunov had conducted a competent performance of Rachmaninoff's orchestral fantasy The Rock the previous year. While it was generally received favorably, C√©sar Cui stated, in a foretaste of his comments on the symphony, that \\"the whole composition shows that this composer is more concerned about sound than about music.\\"Bertenssohn and Leyva, 68. =Contemporary response= Political bias C√©sar Cui led the critical charge against the symphony. For all of Belyayev's good intentions, having the First Symphony performed in St. Petersburg did not necessarily bode well, with Rimsky-Korsakov's comment merely serving as an omen of things to come. The St. Petersburg musical scene was dominated by a group of young composers called the Belyayev circle, headed by Rimsky-Korsakov since he had taught many of them at the Conservatory there. While Rimsky-Korsakov called the group \\"progressive\\" in his autobiography,Rimsky-Korsakov, My Musical Life, 286‚Äì287. musicologist Francis Maes suggests a better term for the group's focus might have been \\"moderately academic\\" as the majority of these composers turned technical accomplishment into an end in itself. This attitude, claims musicologist Solomon Volkov, had long typified the St. Petersburg Conservatory and the majority of its alumni.Volkov, Solomon, St. Petersburg: A Cultural History (New York: The Free Press, 1995), 349. The academic style of musical composition which resulted from this attitude, typified best in the works of Glazunov and Rimsky- Korsakov, became the preferred method of this group. If a composer wanted to be accepted into the Belyayev circle or receive Belyayev's patronage, he had to conform by writing musical works in this vein.Maes, 173. This bias would continue to some point after Rimsky-Korsakov's departure with his son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg in charge of composition classes at the Conservatory through the 1920s,Wilson, 37. and Shostakovich would complain about Steinberg's conservatism, typified by such phrases as \\"the inviolable foundations of the kuchka\\" and the \\"sacred traditions of Nikolai Andreyevich [Rimsky-Korsakov].\\"Letter from Shostakovich to Tatyana Glivenko dated February 26, 1924. As quoted in Fay, 24. Despite Rimsky-Korsakov's denial of the Belyayev circle being similar to The Five under Mily Balakirev, the two factions did share one trait. Like The Five, the Belyayev group viewed with suspicion those compositions that did not follow its canon.Volkov, St. Petersburg, 350.  Critical reaction  Much of what was written about the symphony may have been motivated by a long-standing antagonism between St. Petersburg and Moscow. There was also the fact it was a symphony in question this time‚Äîa musical form the St. Petersburg critics and many other members of the Belyayev Circle were very particular about defending. While critics in St. Petersburg had actually given good reviews to The Rock when Glazunov conducted it, a symphony was another matter. Rachmaninoff's work may have been considered offensive because of its relatively progressive use of symphonic form; this could have gone against the critics' sensibilities as well as the precepts Rimsky-Korsakov taught at the Conservatory. Aleksandr Gauk, who would conduct the triumphant revival of the symphony in 1945, surmised as much, suggesting the work failed initially \\"because it was a modern composition, far ahead of its time, so it did not satisfy the tastes of the contemporary critics.\\"Cited in Gronowicz, Antoni, ‚Äò‚ÄôSergei Rachmaninoff‚Äô‚Äô (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1946), 67. The more partisan of these critics went on the attack, with Cui leading the charge: Cui did give Rachmaninoff as close to a compliment as he would ever come, writing, \\"Mr. Rachmaninoff does avoid banality, and probably feels strongly and deeply, and tries to express these feelings in new forms.\\" However, this olive branch was too obscured by the vitriol of the rest of the review for anyone to notice. Moreover, Cui's bias against Moscow composers was extremely deep-seated. In a letter to M.S. Kerzina dated December 19, 1904, he placed them together with Richard Strauss, \\"whose absurd cacophony will not be music even in the 30th century.\\"Bertenssohn and Leyva, 72 ft. A more balanced consideration of the work, unfortunately too late to undo the damage wrought by Cui, came from critic Nikolai Findeisen in the April issue of Russkaya Muzykalnaya Gazeta: Composer's reaction Rachmaninoff wrote to composer Alexander Zatayevich on May 6 \\"of my impressions of the performance of the symphony ... though it is difficult for me.\\".Bertenssohn and Leyva, 73. This letter has been cited frequently for the composer's opinion of Glazunov's lack of conducting skill. However, Rachmaninoff also writes extensively about his impression of the symphony itself: Long after the fact, Rachmaninoff told his biographer Oskar von Riesemann, \\"I returned to Moscow a changed man. My confidence in myself had received a sudden blow. Agonizing hours spent in doubt and hard thinking had brought me to the conclusion that I ought to give up composing.\\"Riesemann, 102. However, the composer's comments to Zatayevich seem considerably more rational, even logical. Nor had the press been entirely unfavorable toward the symphony (see above). It may have been on subsequent reflection that Rachmaninoff suffered his psychological collapse.Harrison, 78. As Harrison points out, \\"This delay in Rachmaninoff's collapse has never been, and presumably never will be, satisfactorily explained.\\" One question some scholars have asked is whether the symphony had an autobiographical element that gave its failure a more personal dimension. According to many sources, the original manuscript, now lost, carried a dedication to \\"A. L.\\" plus the epigraph to Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina, \\"Vengeance is mine; I will repay.\\"Romans 21:19 A. L. was Anna Lodyzhenskaya, the beautiful Gypsy wife of his friend Peter Lodyzhensky. He had also dedicated the Caprice Boh√©mien to her. Whether Rachmaninoff's regard for her was merely infatuation or something more serious cannot be known. Neither can the connection between the two of them and Anna Karenina, or between the biblical quotation and the religious chants providing the basis for the symphony's thematic material. When the collapse came, Rachmaninoff was left totally shattered. He had begun sketches for another symphony but now abandoned themNorris, New Grove, 15:551‚Äì552. and was unable to compose until 1899, when family members and friends convinced him to seek hypnotic therapy with Dr. Nikolai Dahl. The product of these meetings was the Second Piano Concerto, premiered in 1900. But during this period he focused on conducting and performing, so the time was not lost at all. One stroke of good fortune came from impresario Savva Mamontov, who two years earlier had founded the Moscow Private Russian Opera Company. He offered Rachmaninoff the post of assistant conductor for the 1897-8 season, which the composer accepted. He also acted as a soloist in many concerts.Harrison, 84-85. Neglect and disappearance The symphony was not performed again in Rachmaninoff's lifetime.Bertenssohn and Leyva, 74. Although it is sometimes said that he tore the score up; he in fact did not, but he remained ambivalent towards the piece. In April 1908, three months after the successful premiere of his Second Symphony, he considered revising the First. He wrote to his Conservatory colleague Nikita Morozov that the symphony was one of three of his early works that he would like to see in a \\"corrected, decent form.\\" (The other two compositions were the First Piano Concerto and Caprice Boh√©mien.)Bertenssohn and Leyva, 144‚Äì145; Norris, Rachmaninoff, 97. He wrote in 1910 to critic Grigory Prokofiev, \\"The symphony contains many successful passages insofar as its music is concerned, but the orchestration is worse than weak, a fact that caused its failure at the St. Petersburg performance.\\"Quoted by Yasser (1951). In 1917, in a letter to Boris Asafiev, he wrote that he would not show it to anyone and make sure in his will that no one would see it. Before his departure from Russia, Rachmaninoff gave the key to his writing desk in his Moscow flat to his cousin Sofiya Satin; in it was locked the manuscript score for the First Symphony. He showed her the manuscript and asked her to look after it for him.Satina conversation with Martyn, cited Martyn, 103. Satina had the desk moved to her own flat, in the same building. It remained there until Satina emigrated from Russia in 1921. At that time, the manuscript passed into the care of the family housekeeper, Mariya Shatalina (n√©e Ivanova). Shatalina died in 1925. All other manuscripts from Rachmaninoff's flat were moved by the state to archives of the Glinka Museum in Moscow, including the manuscript of the two-piano version of the symphony as well as some sketches for the work, but the manuscript score disappeared. The mysterious disappearance of the score has suggested to some that it may have been appropriated by an opportunist. Regardless of the exact circumstances, the manuscript score remains lost.Martyn, 103. Second life While Rachmaninoff had kept the score of the First Symphony safely in his Moscow flat until the October Revolution, he had made no attempt to collect the orchestral parts in his haste to leave St. Petersburg in 1897. This fact would prove fortuitous in the symphony's ultimate fate.Harrison, 81‚Äì2. Shortly after the composer's death, in 1944, the instrumental parts of the symphony were discovered by chance in the Belyayev Archive of the Leningrad Conservatory Library. Using these parts and the two-piano arrangement, a group of scholars headed by prominent Russian conductor Aleksandr Gauk reconstructed the full score. The second performance of the piece, considered a success, took place at the Moscow Conservatory on October 17, 1945, conducted by Aleksandr Gauk. The American premiere took place on March 19, 1948 at the Philadelphia Academy of Music, the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy. It was part of the first concert to be televised in the United States. A second performance was broadcast on radio the following day. Worth noting in light of the 1897 premiere is that seven rehearsals were needed to prepare the work for its initial American hearing, even though both Ormandy and the Philadelphia had long been familiar with the composer's style. With the posthumous rise in Rachmaninoff's reputation as a composer, the symphony became part of the standard orchestral repertoire. Conversely, the first British performance of the symphony did not take place until January 2, 1964, with the semi-professional Polyphonia Symphony Orchestra conducted by Bryan Fairfax. This was during a time when Rachmaninoff's music was held in low regard in the United Kingdom.Harrison, 83 ft. 21. The first Australian performance was in 1985 in the Perth Concert Hall by the West Australian Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Vladimir Verbitsky.  Popular uses  The theme from the symphony's fourth movement was used for a time during the late 1960s as the title music of the BBC television programme PanoramaYouTube discussion . The symphony's premiere and Rachmaninoff's subsequent writer's block and hypnotherapy are the subject of Dave Malloy's 2015 musical Preludes; the score uses samples of the symphony and other works of Rachmaninoff's.

It is the most widespread and destructive of the bee brood diseases.  Characteristics  Paenibacillus larvae is a rod-shaped bacterium, which is visible only under a high power microscope. Larvae up to 3 days old become infected by ingesting spores that are present in their food. Young larvae less than 24 hours old are most susceptible to infection. Spores germinate in the gut of the larva and the vegetative form of the bacteria begins to grow, taking its nourishment from the larva. Spores will not germinate in larvae over 3 days old. Infected larvae normally die after their cell is sealed. The vegetative form of the bacterium will die but not before it produces many millions of spores. Each dead larva may contain as many as 100 million spores. This disease only affects the bee larvae but is highly infectious and deadly to bee brood. Infected larvae darken and die.Foul brood disease of honey bees:recognition and control Central Science Laboratory National Bee Unit, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA); United Kingdom (excellent publication with many pictures)\\"Bees Disease: One Step Closer To A Cure.\\" ScienceDaily 4 May 2008 History Until 1906 American foulbrood was not differentiated from European foulbrood, and the condition was simply referred to as foulbrood. Thereafter, the terms European and American were used to distinguish the diseases.Phillips (1906) However the designations do not refer to the geographical distributions but to the areas where they were first investigated scientifically.Shimanuki, Hachiro; Knox, David A. Diagnosis of Honey Bee Diseases USDA In 1907, it was demonstrated conclusively that the bacterium Bacillus larvae was the cause of American foulbrood disease by fulfilling Koch's postulates.White 1907 The geographical origin of AFB is unknown, but it is found almost worldwide.Matheson, 1993,1996American Foulbrood disease A.M. Alippi Laboratorio de Fitopatologia, Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias y Forestales Universidad Nacional deL a Plata, Calle 60 y 118, C.C. 31, 1900 La Plata, Argentina Diagnosis Lab testing is necessary for definitive diagnosis, but a good field test is to touch a dead larva with a toothpick or twig. It will be sticky and \\"ropey\\" (drawn out). Foulbrood also has a characteristic odor, and experienced beekeepers with a good sense of smell can often detect the disease upon opening a hive. However, this odour may not be noticeable until the disease is in an advanced stage. Since response and treatment is required as early as possible to protect other colonies, absence of odour cannot be relied on as indicating absence of foulbrood. Only regular and thorough inspection of the brood can identify the disease in its early stages. The most reliable disease diagnosis is done by sending in some possibly affected brood comb to a laboratory specialized in identifying honey bee diseases.USDA Agricultural Research Service Submission of Samples for Diagnosis (2007) Disease spread When cleaning infected cells, bees distribute spores throughout the colony. Disease spreads rapidly throughout the hive as the bees, trying to remove the spore-laden dead larvae, contaminate brood food. Nectar stored in contaminated cells will contain spores and soon the brood chamber becomes filled with contaminated honey. As this honey is moved up into the supers, the entire hive becomes contaminated with spores. When the colony becomes weak from AFB infection, robber bees may enter and take contaminated honey back to their hives, thereby spreading the disease to other colonies and apiaries. Beekeepers also may spread disease by moving equipment (frames or supers) from contaminated hives to healthy ones. American foulbrood spores are extremely resistant to desiccation and can remain viable for more than 40 years in honey and beekeeping equipment. Therefore, honey from an unknown source should never be used as bee feed, and used beekeeping equipment should be assumed to be contaminated unless known to be otherwise.American Foul Brood-Prevention and Control Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture Beehives with American foul brood should be burned due to spores that remain viable for up to 40 years. Treatment European Union law requires all infected hives and equipment to be destroyed.Bee disease confirmed in Perthshire. Scottish Government. Published: 28 May 2020. https://www.gov.scot/news/bee-disease-confirmed-in-perthshire-1/ In the US, many State Apiary Inspectors require an AFB diseased hive to be burned completely. The spores can survive up to 40 years and are difficult to destroy. A less radical method of containing the spread of disease is burning only the frames and comb and thoroughly flame scorching the interior of the hive body, bottom board and covers. Dipping the hive parts in hot paraffin wax or a 3% sodium hypochlorite solution (bleach) also renders the AFB spores innocuous.Dobbelaere W, de Graaf DC, Reybroeck W, Desmedt E, Peeters JE, Jacobs FJ Disinfection of wooden structures contaminated with Paenibacillus larvae subsp. larvae spores Journal of Applied Microbology (Aug 2, 2001) It is also possible to sterilize an infected hive without damaging either the structure of the hive or the stores of honey and pollen it contains by sufficiently lengthy exposure to an atmosphere of ethylene oxide gas, as in a closed chamber, as hospitals do to sterilize equipment that cannot withstand steam sterilization. Antibiotics, in non-resistant strains of the pathogen, can prevent the vegetative state of the bacterium forming. Drug treatment to prevent the American foulbrood spores from successfully germinating and proliferating is possible using oxytetracycline hydrochloride (Terramycin).Calderone, Nicholas Management of Honey Bee Brood Diseases (January 2001) Cornell University Another drug treatment, tylosin tartrate, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005.USDA Agricultural Research Service New Antibiotic Approved for Treating Bacterial Honey Bee Disease Chemical treatment is sometimes used prophylactically, but this is a source of considerable controversy because certain strains of the bacterium seem to be rapidly developing resistance.Powell, Gordon Cleaning up American Foulbrood Iowa Honey Producers Association, The Buzz Newsletter (Jan 2006) In addition, hives that are contaminated with millions of American foulbrood spores have to be prophylactically treated indefinitely. Once the treatment is suspended, the American foulbrood spores germinate successfully again leading to a disease outbreak. Thomas Brady at Brigham Young University and Heather Hendrickson at Massey University are currently studying phage therapy to treat American foulbrood. Lactic acid-producing bacteria inhibit the growth of the spore and vegetative cells of Paenibacillus larvae under laboratory conditions. However, the bacteria made no difference to infected honey bee colonies.

The film was made by British studio Hammer Film Productions and was their third adaptation of the story after The Ugly Duckling and The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll. The film is notable for showing Jekyll transform into a female Hyde; it also incorporates into the plot aspects of the historical Jack the Ripper and Burke and Hare cases. The two characters were played by the film's stars, Ralph Bates and Martine Beswick. Plot Dr. Henry Jekyll dedicates his life to the curing of all known illnesses; however, his lecherous friend Professor Robertson remarks that Jekyll's experiments take so long to actually be discovered, he will no doubt be dead by the time he is able to achieve anything. Haunted by this remark, Jekyll abandons his studies and obsessively begins searching for an elixir of life, using female hormones taken from fresh cadavers supplied by murderers Burke and Hare, reasoning that these hormones will help him to extend his life since women traditionally live longer than men and have stronger systems. In the apartment above Jekyll's lives a family: an elderly mother, her daughter Susan Spencer, and Susan's brother Howard. Susan is attracted to Jekyll, and he too returns her affections, but is too obsessed with his work to make advances. Once mixing the female hormones into a serum and drinking it, it not only has the effect of changing Jekyll's character (for the worse) but also of changing his sex, transforming him into a beautiful but evil woman. Susan becomes jealous when she discovers this mysterious woman, but when she confronts Jekyll, to explain the sudden appearance of his female alter ego, he calls her Mrs. Edwina Hyde, saying she is his widowed sister who has come to live with him. Howard, on the other hand, develops a lust for Mrs. Hyde. Jekyll soon finds that his serum requires a regular supply of female hormones to maintain its effect, necessitating the killing of young girls. Burke and Hare supply his needs, but their criminal activities are uncovered. Burke is lynched by a mob and Hare blinded. The doctor decides to take matters into his own hands and commits the murders attributed to Jack the Ripper. Jekyll abhors this, but Mrs. Hyde relishes the killings as she begins to take control, even seducing and then killing Professor Robertson when he attempts to question her about the murders. As Mrs. Hyde grows more powerful, the two personalities begin to struggle for dominance. Jekyll asks Susan to the opera; however, when he is getting dressed to go out, he unconsciously takes Mrs. Hyde's gown from the wardrobe instead of his own clothes, realizing that he no longer needs to drink the serum in order to transform. Susan is heartbroken when Jekyll fails to take her out to the opera, and she decides to go alone. However, the evil Mrs. Hyde decides that innocent, pure Susan's blood is just what she needs to finally overtake Jekyll's body. She stalks Susan through the dark streets, but Jekyll's will only just manages to thwart Mrs. Hyde's attempt to kill Susan. He then commits one last murder to find a way to stabilize his condition, but he is interrupted by the police after a comment by Hare leads them to realize the similarity between Jekyll's earlier experiments on cadavers and the Ripper murders. As Jekyll tries to escape by climbing along the outside of a building, he transforms into Mrs. Hyde, who, lacking his strength, falls to the ground ‚Äî dying as a twisted amalgamation of both male and female.

George R. Reis from DVD Drive-In gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"In the hands of most filmmakers of the time, such a gender-bending theme would call for maximum exploitation tactics, but not with Hammer. Clemens' script doesn't take itself too seriously, yet justly fuses the legends of Stevenson's titular character with Jack the Ripper and the graverobbers Burke and Hare\\". Reis commended the film's performances and Baker's direction. Variety Magazine called the film \\"highly imaginative\\", further writing, \\"Director Roy Ward Baker has set a good pace, built tension nicely and played it straight so that all seems credible. He tops chills and gruesome murders with quite a lot of subtle fun. Bates and Beswick, strong, attractive personalities, bear a strange resemblance to each other making the transitions entirely believable.\\" John Higgins of Starburst Magazine awarded the film 8/10 stars, praising Beswick's performance and the script.

Though Fisk was admired by the working class of New York and the Erie Railroad, he achieved much ill-fame for his role in Black Friday in 1869, where he and his partner Jay Gould befriended the unsuspecting President Ulysses S. Grant in an attempt to use the President's good name in a scheme to corner the gold market in New York City. Several years later Fisk was murdered by a disgruntled business associate. Early life and career Fisk was born in the hamlet of Pownal, Vermont, in Bennington County in 1835. After a brief period in school, he ran away in 1850 and joined Van Amberg's Mammoth Circus & Menagerie. Later, he became a hotel waiter, and finally adopted the business of his father, a peddler. He applied what he learned in the circus to his peddling and grew his father's business. He then became a salesman for Jordan Marsh, a Boston dry goods firm. A failure as a salesman, he was sent to Washington, D.C., in 1861 to sell textiles to the government. By his shrewd dealing in army contracts during the Civil War, and, by some accounts, cotton smuggling across enemy lines - in which he enlisted the help of his father - he accumulated considerable wealth, which he soon lost in speculation. At the end of the war, he made a fortune by learning of the end of the Siege of Petersburg which guaranteed Confederate defeat and sending an agent on a fast boat to London to short as many Confederate bonds as possible before the news arrived.\\"Jubilee Jim Fisk and the great Civil War score: In 1865, a failed stockbroker tries to pull off one of the boldest financial schemes in American history: the original big short\\", David K. Thomson Business career In 1864 Fisk became a stockbroker in New York City, and was employed by Daniel Drew as a buyer. He aided Drew in the Erie War against Cornelius Vanderbilt for control of the Erie Railroad. This resulted in Fisk and Jay Gould becoming members of the Erie directorate, and subsequently, a well-planned raid netted Fisk and Gould control of the railroad. The association with Gould continued until Fisk's death. Fisk and Gould carried financial buccaneering to extremes: their program included an open alliance with New York politician Boss Tweed, the wholesale bribery of legislatures, and the buying of judges. Their attempt to corner the gold market culminated in the fateful Black Friday of September 24, 1869. Though many investors were ruined, Fisk and Gould escaped significant financial harm. Personal life Josie Mansfield Edward Stiles Stokes Fisk married Lucy Moore in 1854, when he was 19 and she was 15. Lucy was an orphan, raised by an uncle from Springfield, Massachusetts. She tolerated Fisk's many extramarital affairs, perhaps because she was happy living with her own love, Fanny Harrod, in Boston. Regardless, they remained close, with Fisk visiting her every few weeks and spending summers and vacations with her every chance he could. In New York, Fisk had a relationship with Josie Mansfield. Mansfield was considered a voluptuous beauty by Victorian standards of female desirability. Fisk housed Mansfield in an apartment a few doors down from the Erie Railroad headquarters on West 23rd Street and had a covered passage built linking the back doors of the headquarters and her apartment building. Fisk's relationship with Mansfield scandalized New York society. Mansfield eventually fell in love with Fisk's business associate Edward Stiles Stokes (1840‚Äì1901), a man noted for his good looks. Stokes left his wife and family, and Mansfield left Fisk. = Fisk's murder and aftermath = In a bid for money, Mansfield and Stokes tried to extort Fisk by threatening the publication of letters written by Fisk to Mansfield that allegedly proved Fisk's legal wrongdoings. A legal and public relations battle followed, but Fisk refused to pay Mansfield anything. Increasingly frustrated and flirting with bankruptcy, Stokes confronted Fisk in New York City on January 6, 1872, in the Grand Central Hotel and shot him twice, in the arm and abdomen. A relatively young man of 36, Fisk died of the abdominal wound the next morning after giving a dying declaration identifying Stokes as the killer. Stokes pleaded self-defense, using a wildly incongruent set of mitigating circumstances. He claimed to have been suffering from emotional turmoil at the time he committed the act. Fisk's death was blamed on medical malpractice by those who treated his mortal wound. Stokes was subsequently tried three times for the Fisk murder. The first trial where he was charged with first degree murder ended in a hung jury, and rumors of jury members bribed. The second trial found him guilty of first degree murder and he was sentenced to death, a verdict overturned by appeal. The third trial concluded with a conviction for manslaughter, and Stokes served four years of a six-year prison sentence in Sing Sing Penitentiary. Fisk's body was laid out for public view in the Grand Opera House, which he had owned. Some twenty thousand people came to pay their respects with five times as many more individuals waiting in the streets to gain entrance. The notorious letters Fisk had written to Mansfield, numbering thirty-nine, were published in the New York Herald one week after his death. For those who had hoped to read revelations detailing Fisk's corrupt business practices, the letters were a sorry disappointment, being no more than the commonplace communications between a man and the woman he loved. Fisk is buried in the Prospect Hill Cemetery in Brattleboro, Vermont. Fisk was vilified by high society for his amoral and eccentric ways and by many pundits of the day for his business dealings; but he was loved and mourned by the workingmen of New York and the Erie Railroad. He was known as \\"Colonel\\" for being the nominal commander of the 9th New York National Guard Infantry Regiment, although his only experience of military action with this unit was an inglorious role in the Orange Riot of July 12, 1871. In popular culture Fisk's life was fictionalized in the biopic The Toast of New York (1937), starring Edward Arnold as Fisk. He may be the inspiration for the character \\"Big Jim\\" in Bob Dylan's song \\"Lily, Rosemary, and The Jack of Hearts\\". In Phoebe Atwood Taylor's Figure Away, a woman says that \\"Jim Fisk was shot with [a revolver] just like\\" the one that she owns. The Colt House Revolver is known among collectors as the Jim Fisk model or the Jim Fisk pistol, as it was used by Edward Stiles Stokes (Ned Stokes) in his murder. The circumstances surrounding his murder were dramatized in the CBS radio program Crime Classics on June 29, 1953 in the episode entitled \\"The Checkered Life and Sudden Death of Colonel James Fisk\\".

The large majority of thermoacidophiles are archaea (particularly the crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota) or bacteria, though occasional eukaryotic examples have been reported. Thermoacidophiles can be found in hot springs and solfataric environments, within deep sea vents, or in other environments of geothermal activity. They also occur in polluted environments, such as in acid mine drainage. An apparent tradeoff has been described between adaptation to high temperature and low pH; relatively few examples are known that are tolerant of the extremes of both environments (pH < 2, growth temperature > 80¬∞C). Many thermoacidophilic archaea have aerobic or microaerophilic metabolism, although obligately anaerobic examples (e.g. the Acidilobales) have also been identified. Sequencing the genome of a thermoacidophilic eukaryote, the red algae Galdieria sulphuraria, revealed that its environmental adaptations likely originated from horizontal gene transfer from thermoacidophilic archaea and bacteria.

VP-Info was a competitor to the Clipper and dBase applications in the late 1980s and 1990s. VP-Info runs on MS-DOS, DR-DOS and the PC-MOS/386 operating system. The last release of VP-Info was named Shark. Origin In the early 1980s, David Clark met George Gratzer, a mathematics professor at the University of Manitoba, at ComputerLand in Winnipeg where Gratzer was looking for someone who could program in dBase. Clark had been using dBase II, but was frustrated by its limitations for reporting on more than 2 tables at a time. While working for Standard Knitting (a client of Gratzer's and Clark's), David wrote a report generator called dComp that would allow up to six related data files to be in use at one time and run faster than the slow, dBase II. Clark and Gratzer subsequently formed a partnership in a company called \\"Sub Rosa\\" that developed dComp into a full dBase II compatible language/database called Max that had more speed and \\"power tools\\" than even dBase III contained. Clark designed and developed the program while Gratzer wrote the reference and tutorial manuals. This product was published by Paperback Software and sold over 30,000 copies (worldwide) in 1987 alone. The published reference manual for VP-Info was over 900 pages and the program was distributed in an extra thick back cover which was an innovation for all Paperback Software products at that time.Bursten, Melman, Gratzer 1990-1992, Shark User's Guide. rev. ed. 1992, Sub Rosa Corporation, Minneapolis USA, \\"Introduction\\" page i For programmers, Max had several interesting capabilities, including the ability to change field names easily, to represent fields in array form, automatically execute code while moving from field to field and many tools like cross tabs. With its built-in editor, a programmer could go from edit to executing the program in 2 keystrokes and back to editing the program with just 2 more. Marketing Paperback Software International Ltd. acquired worldwide marketing rights to Max and launched it as VP-Info in 1986. Lotus Development Corp. objected to some of the features of VP-Planner 3D, a Lotus look-alike with a number of features beyond those of 1-2-3, and sued Paperback Software for copyright infringement in 1989. Though the lawsuit ultimately failed in the courts, Paperback Software eventually folded following the litigations. Sub Rosa Inc. reacquired worldwide distribution rights to VP-Info shortly before it entered bankruptcy. Bursten and an associate, Bernie Melman of Toronto, established Sub Rosa Publishing Inc. in Toronto and Sub Rosa Corporation in Minneapolis and attempted to get VP-Info back into distribution. Since the name belonged to the bankrupt Paperback Software, however, they had to give it yet another name, and Shark (or Sharkbase) was introduced in 1992 as an upgrade to VP-Info.The History of FoxPro: http://www.foxprohistory.org/vp-info_sharkbase_by_subrosa.htm Technical VP-Info can read and write all the common dBase/Clipper file formats, as well as exchange data with OpenOffice. VP-Info can read and write any type of dbf files (e.g. dBase II,III,IV, Clipper) at the same time. Unlike the older dBase file formats, VP-Info dbf files can have an unlimited number of records. VP- Info has a built-in compiler for fast execution. Like many DOS applications, VP-Info is available for free download.WinWorld: https://winworldpc.com/ An online User's Manual for the latest distribution of VP-Info, SharkBase, is still maintained.Shark/VP-Info Reference Manual: http://www.intelligentwebware.com/SHARK/shark-ref.html VP-Info, and subsequent SharkBase versions, can run on 32-bit or 64-bit Windows, using a virtual machine or emulator to provide a usable environment.

He was a leading critic of the colonial government and the policies of Jamaican Governor Edward Eyre. After the start of the Morant Bay rebellion in October 1865, Eyre declared martial law in that area, directed troops to suppress the rebellion, and ordered the arrest of Gordon in Kingston. He had him returned to Morant Bay to stand trial under martial law. Gordon was quickly convicted of conspiracy and executed, on suspicion of having planned the rebellion. Eyre's rapid execution of Gordon on flimsy charges during the crisis, and the death toll and violence of his suppression of the revolt, resulted in a huge controversy in Britain. Opponents of Eyre and his actions attempted to have him prosecuted for murder, but the case never went to trial. He was forced to resign. The British government passed legislation to make Jamaica a Crown Colony, governing it directly for decades. In 1969, the Jamaican government proclaimed Gordon as a National Hero of Jamaica . Early life George William Gordon was the second of eight children born in Jamaica to a Scottish planter, Joseph Gordon (1790?‚Äì1867), and an enslaved woman, Ann Rattray (1792? ‚Äì before 1865).George William Gordon Website His siblings were Mary Ann (1813?), Margaret (1819?), Janet Isabella (1824?), John (1825?), Jane (1826?), Ann (1828?) and Ralph Gordon (1830). Joseph Gordon had migrated to Jamaica to serve as an attorney for a number of absentee-owned sugar estates, and he later bought several properties himself. Among them was Cherry Garden Estate, where George William was born. Joseph Gordon later served as a member of the House of Assembly and as Custos of the parish of St Andrew.Clinton V. Black, History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 187. Gordon was self-educated, teaching himself to read, write, and perform simple accounting. He was born a slave. His father gave him his freedom and at the age of ten, he was allowed to live with his godfather, James Daly of Black River, Jamaica. Within a year, Gordon began working in Daly's business. Business career In 1836, young Gordon opened a store in Kingston and operated as a produce dealer. Richard Hill (Jamaica), a mixed- race lawyer and leader of the free coloured community, met him in that year and said of him, \\"He impressed me then, though young-looking, with the air of a man of ready business habits.\\"C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 188. Gordon was a successful businessman. In 1842, he had earned enough to be able to send his sisters to England and France to be educated. Three years later, he was worth ¬£10,000. His father had little to do with him when he was growing up, but when Joseph ran into financial difficulties, it was the son who bailed him out, and cleared the debts on Cherry Garden, before giving it back to the father.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 188. One historian says he married Lucy Shannon, the white daughter of an Irish newspaper editor.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 188. Another states he married a white widow named Mary Jane Perkins, whose mother had established a school for girls in Kingston.Gad Heuman, The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), p. 63. Gordon later moved to St. Thomas-in-the-East Parish at the eastern end of the island, where he became a wealthy businessman and a landowner. In the 1840s, he co-founded the Jamaica Mutual Life Assurance Society, and was appointed a justice of the peace in seven parishes.Gad Heuman, The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), p. 63. However, in the early 1860s, Gordon lost heavily in coffee dealings.Gad Heuman, The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), p. 63. Political career In the 1850s, Gordon ran as a member of Jordon's \\"town party\\". Gordon was elected from St. Thomas-in- the-East parish as a member of the House of Assembly. On more than one occasion, Gordon deputised as mayor of Kingston for Edward Jordon.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 189. Gordon was a radical politician who was popular in the parish of St Thomas-in-the-East, and he was deeply affected by the suffering of the black poor. He complained to a previous governor, Charles Henry Darling, about the poor conditions of the Morant Bay gaol. In 1862, when he made similar complaints to Eyre, the governor immediately removed Gordon from the magistracy. The Colonial Office took the curious stance of backing Eyre while praising Gordon for calling for prison conditions to be improved.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 10, 64‚Äì5. Gordon earned a reputation by the mid-1860s as a critic of the colonial government, especially Governor Edward John Eyre. He maintained a correspondence with English evangelical critics of colonial policy. He also established a Native Baptist church, where Paul Bogle was a deacon. In 1863, Gordon defeated his rival, a white planter, for a seat on the Assembly for St Thomas-in-the-East with the support of the small settler vote, galvanised by Bogle. Gordon was also made a member of the parish vestry. However, the colonial elite who ran the parish vestry objected to the presence of Gordon, because he represented the concerns of the black peasantry. A father and son team of the same name, Stephen Cooke, conspired to have Gordon expelled from the parish vestry, a move that angered the black peasantry. The next year, the settlers re-elected Gordon to the parish vestry, and he brought a court action against the custos of the parish, Baron von Ketelhodt.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 66‚Äì7. In May 1865 Gordon allegedly attempted to purchase an ex- Confederate schooner with a view to ferrying arms and ammunition to Jamaica from the United States of America, although this was unknown at the time. In 1865 the mass of Jamaicans were ex-slaves and their descendants; they struggled with poverty and crop failure in the mostly rural economy, and the aftermath of crippling epidemics of cholera and smallpox. Gordon criticised Eyre's draconian punishments such as flogging and the treadmill for crimes such as stealing food. He warned that \\"If we are to be governed by such a Governor much longer, the people will have to fly to arms and become self- governing.\\"C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 191. Morant Bay Rebellion There were several causes for the Morant Bay Rebellion of 1865, and one of them was outrage among the black peasantry of St Thomas-in-the-East over the colonial government's actions in expelling Gordon and Bogle from the local vestry.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 14, 184. In October, a riot led by Bogle was ruthlessly suppressed by Eyre, with the support of Jamaican Maroons from Moore Town, and hundreds of black Jamaican men and women were killed by government forces without trial, or in hastily- arranged trials under martial law.Gad Heuman, The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994). Death and aftermath 150px In October 1865, following the Morant Bay Rebellion led by Bogle, Governor Eyre ordered the arrest of Gordon, whom he suspected of planning the rebellion. By order of Eyre, Gordon was transported from Kingston, where martial law was not in force, to Morant Bay, where it was. Within two days Gordon was tried for high treason by court-martial, without due process of law, sentenced to death, and executed on 23 October.Gad Heuman, The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), pp. 146‚Äì151. The execution of Gordon and the brutality of Eyre's suppression of the revolt, with hundreds of Jamaicans killed by soldiers and more executed after trials, made the affair a cause c√©l√®bre in Britain. John Stuart Mill and other liberals sought unsuccessfully to have Eyre (and othersSpecifically Colonel Abercrombie Nelson and Lieutenant Herbert Brand (Hanford, page 841).) prosecuted. When they were unable to get the cases to trial, the liberals worked to bring civil proceedings against Eyre.In relation to the civil proceedings, see Phillips v Eyre (1870) LR 6 QB 1 He was forced to resign from office but never went to trial.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 164‚Äì182 Legacy and honours George Gordon on the Jamaican ten-dollar note In the 20th-century aftermath of the labour rebellion of 1938, Gordon came to be seen as a precursor of Jamaican nationalism. The play George William Gordon (1938) by Roger Mais was about his life. In 1960 the Parliament of Jamaica moved into the new Gordon House, named for the politician. In 1969, Gordon and Bogle were each proclaimed as Jamaican National Heroes in a government ceremony at Morant Bay. In 1969, Jamaica converted its currency to a decimal system, and it issued new currency. Gordon was featured on the ten- dollar note (now a coin). George William Gordon is mentioned in the song \\"Innocent Blood\\" and also \\"See them a come\\" by the reggae band Culture. He is noted in the song \\"Silver Tongue Show\\" by Groundation, \\"Give Thanks and Praise\\" by Roy Rayon, \\"Prediction\\" and \\"Born Fe Rebel\\" by Steel Pulse, and \\"Our Jamaican National Heroes\\" by Horace Andy.

The more notable is a Norwegian crown prince with a few brief scenes in the play, who delivers the final lines that represent a hopeful future for the monarchy of Denmark and its subjects. Fortinbras is also the name of the former king of Norway and father of the crown prince Fortinbras. King Fortinbras was slain in the play's antecedent action in a duel with King Hamlet. The duel between the two is described by Horatio in Act One, Scene One (I,i) of the play. His name is not Norwegian in origin, but is a FrenchEnglish hybrid (fort in bras) meaning \\"strong in arm.\\" Role in the play Although Fortinbras makes only two brief appearances in the latter half of the play, he is referred to throughout: King Claudius sends ambassadors to Norway in the hopes of staving off his invasion, and they return with the news that Fortinbras will attack Poland but leave Denmark alone. At the very end‚Äîafter all the major characters except Horatio are dead‚ÄîFortinbras and his army enter, accompanied by ambassadors from England who have come to announce that Claudius' supposed orders to execute Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have been carried out. With the throne of Denmark now vacant, Fortinbras is to be crowned ruler. This may be an allusion to the political situation of the day: at the time the play was written, Denmark and Norway were united under a single crown; also, England itself was to be ruled by King James I of England and VI of Scotland, who claimed the throne by virtue of his blood relation to Elizabeth I (the play was written before Elizabeth I's death). Fortinbras also serves as a parallel to Hamlet in many ways: like the latter, he is motivated largely by the death of his father, whose name he also bears (as Hamlet does his), and both serve as princes of their respective countries. In other respects, Fortinbras serves as a foil for Hamlet: while the Danish prince is deliberate and given to long-winded soliloquies, the Norwegian is impulsive and hot-headed, determined to avenge his slain father at any cost. Fortinbras orders that Prince Hamlet be given a soldier's funeral, describing him as \\"likely, had he been put on, to have proved most royally\\". Screen adaptations Hamlet, with a running time in the range of four hours, is seldom performed in its entirety. Consequently, the role of Fortinbras is sometimes omitted, as it was in the 1948 film starring Laurence Olivier, in the 1969 film starring Nicol Williamson, and the 1990 film starring Mel Gibson. He was included, however, in the 1921 Svend Gade and Heinz Schall directed German silent film Hamlet and portrayed by Fritz Achterberg, in the 1964 Broadway revival, which was later filmed as Richard Burton's Hamlet, in the 1980 BBC Shakespeare television production starring Derek Jacobi, in the 1996 film starring Kenneth Branagh and the 2000 film starring Ethan Hawke, although in the 2000 film, he is an enemy of business. In these films he was played by Michael Ebert, Ian Charleson, Rufus Sewell and Casey Affleck, respectively. Fortinbras also appears in the 1964 BBC television Hamlet, starring Christopher Plummer, and here he was played by Donald Sutherland, in what was his first important role. Other stage adaptations Fortinbras is the protagonist of the 1992 play Fortinbras by Lee Blessing. The plot of Fortinbras follows that of Hamlet; the first scene is the death of Hamlet in the original Shakespearean text. The rest of the play is in a vernacular, modern English. Major characters from Hamlet appear as ghosts in this sequel.

A group generally creates its own rules and then adopts such a book to cover meeting procedure not covered in its rules. Different books have been used by organizations and by legislative assemblies.  Application to organizations  A parliamentary authority is a book of rules on conducting business in deliberative assemblies. A group generally creates its own rules and then adopts such a book to cover meeting procedure not covered in its rules. This set of rules is called parliamentary procedure. Rules in a parliamentary authority can be superseded by the group's constitution or bylaws or by adopted procedural rules (with a few exceptions). The adopted procedural rules may be called special rules of order. Assemblies that do not adopt a parliamentary authority may use an existing parliamentary authority by custom, or may consider themselves governed by the ‚Äúcommon parliamentary law‚Äù, or ‚Äúcommon law of parliamentary procedure‚Äù. A society that has adopted bylaws that do not designate a parliamentary authority may adopt one by the same vote required to adopt special rules of order. A mass meeting can adopt a parliamentary authority by a majority vote. The book Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised states, ‚ÄúIn matters on which an organization's adopted parliamentary authority is silent, provisions found in other works on parliamentary law may be persuasive ‚Äì that is, they may carry weight in the absence of overriding reasons for following a different course ‚Äì but they are not binding on the body.‚Äù Survey of usage in organizations A poll by Jim Slaughter surveyed North American Certified Professional Parliamentarians (CPPs) in 1999 to ask what percent of clients used each parliamentary authority. The results were published in 2000 in Parliamentary Journal, the official journal of the American Institute of Parliamentarians: 90 percent used Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR), 8 percent used The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure (formerly Sturgis, now AIPSC), and 3 percent used some other authority, including Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure (Demeter), Riddick's Rules of Procedure (Riddick/Butcher), Bourinot's Rules of Order (Bourinot), and Rules of Order (Davis). Bourinot was used in Canada. = Robert's Rules of Order = Robert's Rules of Order was first published in 1876 by Henry Martyn Robert. It has been revised several times by the original author and then by his successors. As of its publication in 2011, the 11th edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised is the current official edition of the body of work known as \\"Robert's Rules of Order\\". This body of work is the most popular and well-known parliamentary authority in North America. = The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure = The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure was first published in 1950 by Alice Sturgis and referred to as TSC or Sturgis. A new book, titled American Institute of Parliamentarians Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure (AIPSC), was published in 2012. AIPSC is used by many United States medical associations of physicians and dentists, including the American Medical Association House of Delegates and American Association of Orthodontists as well as by the Association of Flight Attendants.\\"Parliamentary Procedures: Interesting Facts and Tips\\", University of Illinois. = Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure = Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure, first published in 1948 by George Demeter, is another parliamentary authority in North America. It is often favored by North American labor unions and many Hellenic organizations.Jim Slaughter, \\"Businesses Must Follow Parliamentary Procedure ,\\" Greensboro News & Record. , Demeter is published by the American Institute of Parliamentarians.  Legislative assemblies  Legislative assemblies in all countries, because of their nature, tend to have a specialized set of rules that differ from parliamentary procedure used by clubs and organizations. = Parliaments = The UK Parliament follows Erskine May's Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament (also known as Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice). There are also the Standing Orders for each House. The House of Commons of Canada follows Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules and Forms. Bourinot's Rules of Order is another book used in Anglophone Canada. In Quebec, the Proc√©dure des assembl√©es d√©lib√©rantes (commonly known as Le Code Morin) are rules of order in French. The Australian House of Representatives follows House of Representatives Practice. The Australian Senate follows Odgers' Australian Senate Practice. Each Australian state and territory house of Parliament has its own set of rules. A number of procedural reference works are used by other organisations in Australia. = Legislatures in the United States = The United States Senate follows the Standing Rules of the United States Senate, while the United States House of Representatives follows its own procedures which includes Jefferson's Manual. Of the 99 state legislative chambers in the United States (two for each state except Nebraska, which has a unicameral legislature), Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure governs parliamentary procedures in 70; Jefferson's Manual governs 13, and Robert's Rules of Order governs four. Mason's Manual, originally written by constitutional scholar and former California Senate staff member Paul Mason in 1935, and since his death revised and published by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), governs legislative procedures in instances where the state constitution, state statutes, and the chamber's rules are silent. According to the NCSL, one of the many reasons that most state legislatures use Mason's Manual instead of Robert's Rules of Order is because Robert's Rules applies best to private organizations and civic groups that do not meet in daily public sessions. Mason's Manual, however, is geared specifically toward state legislative bodies. Legislative bodies at the local level, such as a city council or a county commission, function similarly to boards of societies and as such, have used Robert's Rules of Order.

A crowd estimated at 200,000 to 300,000 attended the concert, four times what the promoters estimated. Food and water were in short supply, and the gathering descended into relative anarchy. After the show was finished, remnants of the crowd members burned the main stage.Evansville Courier & Press 150th Anniversary Special Section, January 8, 1995.Woodstock on the Wabash: The Bull Island rockfest, 40 years later, September 2, 2012. History =Planning= Several months before the festival, promoters Tom Duncan and Bob Alexander held a very successful small festival at Bosse Field in Evansville, Indiana, the Freedom Festival and Ice Cream Social. That show included acts such as Ike and Tina Turner, New Riders of the Purple Sage, and Edgar Winter. Based on that success, Duncan and Alexander planned a bigger festival. The Erie Canal Soda Pop Festival was originally slated for Chandler, Indiana, a small town near Evansville, Indiana. However, various court battles stopped the festival from performance anywhere in Indiana. Shortly before the start of the concert, the promoters decided on a site near Griffin in Posey County, Indiana referred to locally as \\"Bull Island\\". Due to the changing course of the Wabash River, Bull Island is located east of the Wabash River but is part of the State of Illinois. Thus, Bull Island was out of the jurisdiction of the various Indiana courts. The White County, Illinois government in the city of Carmi was surprised that the venue had suddenly ended up in its backyard, and was unable to stop the concert. =The concert= The promoters initially estimated a crowd of 55,000. As the Labor Day approached, it became obvious that a much larger crowd was coming to the festival. As Bull Island was accessible by only two roads, traffic was backed up for 20 miles (30 km) from the festival. Since Bull Island was technically part of Illinois but the only access was through Indiana, police protection and crowd control during the festival were non- existent. Coordination between the Indiana police and the Illinois police was woefully inadequate. The only police on the festival grounds were three county deputy sheriffs from White County, Illinois trying to police a crowd of 200,000 to 300,000. The scheduled lineup included Black Sabbath, Joe Cocker, the Allman Brothers, John Mayall, Cheech & Chong, Canned Heat, Fleetwood Mac, Ballin' Jack, Amboy Dukes, Bob Seger, Bang, Ravi Shankar, Albert King, Brownsville Station, Mike Quatro, Gentle Giant, Black Oak Arkansas, the Eagles, The Chambers Brothers, Boones Farm, Slade, Nazareth, and Delbert & Glenn. However, only bands that included Flash Cadillac & the Continental Kids, Black Oak Arkansas, Ramatam, Mike Quatro, Bang, Cheech and Chong, Foghat, Albert King, Brownsville Station, Santana, Canned Heat, Flash, Ravi Shankar, Rory Gallagher, Lee Michaels and Frosty, The Amboy Dukes, Farm, CK Thunder, and Gentle Giant actually performed. Vince Vance and the Valiants played after Ted Nugent of The Amboy Dukes. =Difficulties and aftermath= Over the three days, the festival drifted steadily into anarchy. Food and water were in short supply. A torrential rain soaked the festival. A truck bringing food into the festival was hijacked, looted and burned. When some vendors overcharged for food and drinks, the crowd turned over many of the RVs and robbed the vendors. Drugs were freely available in a makeshift \\"shopping district\\", where dealers openly displayed their illegal goods. Numerous bands quickly cancelled, and three concert goers drowned in the Wabash River. As the festival ended, what was left of the crowd destroyed the music stand by fire. The promoters later explained that they had sold 30,000 advance tickets for $20 and $25 each, and had estimated a crowd of no more than 55,000 would attend. Thus they were completely unprepared when more than 200,000 people showed up. Following the concert, the promoters were subjected to multiple lawsuits by the owner of Bull Island, the vendors, the Internal Revenue Service, the State of Illinois, and the State of Indiana. The court found the promoters to be in contempt of court and fined them several thousand dollars.

Chick (born 1944) is a longtime California political figure. Most recently she served as California's Inspector General overseeing the state's spending of $85 billion of Federal Recovery Act funding. Chick was appointed to the newly created position by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in April 2009 and served until December 2010, when the office was eliminated. Los Angeles City Elected Offices Chick was elected to the Los Angeles City Council from the Third District (Woodland Hills, Tarzana, Reseda, West Hills, Winnetka and Canoga Park), in 1993 and served two terms, until 2001. She defeated Joy Picus, who had served since 1977, and for whom Chick had worked as a political aide.Laura Chick Biography, LA City Controller In 2001, Chick was elected Los Angeles City Controller, becoming the first woman to hold citywide office in Los Angeles. As Controller, she was the Chief Auditor and Chief Accountant of the City working to ensure its fiscal health. In her nearly eight years in this office, Chick released over 170 audits and reports exposing a wide range of problems throughout city government. In 2006, Los Angeles Magazine named Laura Chick one of the most influential people in the City. The Los Angeles Daily News editorialized, \\"‚Ä¶as City Controller, she's often been downtown's lone champion of good government.\\" A Los Angeles Business Journal feature said, \\"Los Angeles City Controller Laura Chick has emerged as a central voice in the ongoing debate over how the City handles its contracts.\\" In a May, 2004 feature article, Los Angeles Magazine states, \\"Where others couch and evade, she is Ms. Blunt.\\" One of her last audits to be released as City Controller exposed a backlog of thousands of untested DNA rape kits at the Los Angeles Police Department. Chick's report brought a national spotlight to an intolerable situation. This resulted in City officials finally making the problem a priority. Her work won her the prestigious ProPublica Prize for Investigative Governance. Chick left the City Controller's position due to term limits in 2009. Her experience includes managing a family-owned retail business. Laura first entered elected office in 1993 when she defeated a 16-year incumbent for a seat on the Los Angeles City Council. Seven months after taking office her district was devastated by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Chick used the crisis as an opportunity to rebuild, creating what is now a thriving redevelopment zone. California Inspector General Shortly after President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed Laura Chick to act as Inspector General, to provide oversight to the proper use of the federal funds. Chick resigned her City Controller post before the end of her term to accept the state position. \\"Laura's impressive track record as a watchdog and public servant makes her uniquely qualified to ensure this funding is used as it was intended-to create jobs and help our state through this difficult economic time,\\" said Governor Schwarzenegger. The Sacramento Bee heralded Chick's arrival in the Capitol with the headline, \\"Misuse stimulus cash - you'll answer to her\\". Chick took up the state's challenge of overseeing the massive expenditure of American Recovery funds though her Office was given very little resources. With a handful of auditors borrowed from other state departments she scrutinized local agencies across the state. Chick released nearly 30 reports uncovering misspent stimulus funds totaling millions. Chick's tenure in this role ended when the Office of the Inspector General was eliminated by Governor Jerry Brown in December 2010. Personal life Before entering elective office at the age of 49, Chick had already been a stay-at-home mom, manager of a family-owned retail business and social worker. She received her Bachelor's Degree in History from UCLA and a Master's in Social Work from University of Southern California School of Social Work.Laura Chick biography, Inspector General Chick moved to Kennsington, California, near Berkeley, in 2011 where she still lives.

It was also converted and released for the ZX Spectrum (1987) and Commodore 64 (1989) platforms. The game combines platform-style action with shooting gameplay similar to that found in the game Operation Wolf. The game is the second release by the Oliver twins, published when they were just seventeen years old and still going to school. It was conceived as a sequel to their first commercially successful game, Super Robin Hood, although it has little to do with this game other than using a modified version of its engine. The twins have credited the film Ghostbusters and the cartoon series Scooby-Doo for influencing the game. Gameplay Like their previous game, Super Robin Hood, the player controls a character (named Hunk Studbuckle) around the platform style screen using the keyboard or joystick. Uniquely, to attack the enemy, the player must temporarily use the cursor keys to move targeting cross-hairs to shoot ghosts and demons (in a similar manner to Operation Wolf), causing the character to stand still. This results in the player requiring to shoot the targets quickly and operate their character to move around the screen before more would appear. In addition to being able to walk, the character can also jump and climb ladders. In addition to enemies to be killed, the environment contains items that can be collected, including 'macho energy' top-ups and 'key' items that unlock further areas. The game is one of few available on the CPC and ZX Spectrum platforms to feature low resolution clips of human speech, although playing them was so CPU-intensive that the game was required to freeze for their duration. Development Codemasters paid the Oliver brothers ¬£10,000 for the Amstrad CPC release and were offered another ¬£10,000 for a ZX Spectrum release. However, the twins did not wish to produce a port by actually coding on the Spectrum, so to save time, they hired their friend Ivan Link to build a cable that links the Spectrum and the Amstrad. After which the twins produced the only software for the Spectrum they ever wrote called SPLINK (SPectrum and LINK) that enabled the code to be altered for the Amstrad and ported to the Spectrum. Reception After being released, both Spectrum and Amstrad versions went to No. 1 in commercial sales, this in combination with their previous No. 1 title, Super Robin Hood being ported to other platforms gave the Oliver twins a large amount of media exposure, being dubbed \\"The Oliver Twins - Whizz Kids.\\" References * Oliver twins website External links * * Category:1986 video games Category:Action video games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Codemasters games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Europe- exclusive video games Category:Platform games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:ZX Spectrum games ","title":"Ghost Hunters (video game)"},{"id":"2539535","text":"Darlingtonia may refer to: * Darlingtonia, California, in Del Norte County * Darlingtonia Torr., a monotypic genus in the family Sarraceniaceae * Darlingtonia DC., a synonym of the legume genus Desmanthus Willd. * Darlingtonia (snake), a genus of snakes in the family Colubridae ","title":"Darlingtonia"},{"id":"2539541","text":"Manfred Eicher (born 9 July 1943, in Lindau, Germany) is a German record producer and the founder of ECM Records.

In 1984 Eicher started a sublabel, ECM New Series, for classical music. Some of the artists whose work was released on the New Series were Steve Reich, Arvo P√§rt, John Adams, Gavin Bryars, Meredith Monk, and the mediaeval composer P√©rotin. Perhaps the most remarkable record was the bestseller Officium (1994), a collaboration between Jan Garbarek and the Hilliard Ensemble, performing compositions by Crist√≥bal de Morales, P√©rotin and others.

It runs on a straight course in eastern England, between the City of Peterborough and South Kesteven in Lincolnshire. This English name has long been applied to the part which is still in use and which lies between Ailsworth Heath, in the south and Kate's Bridge, in the north. The old road continued to Bourne thence north-westwards to join Ermine Street south of Ancaster. This part of Ermine Street is called High Dike. In the south, King Street joined Ermine Street close to the River Nene, north of Durobrivae. The whole is I. D. Margary's Roman road number 26. (Margary pp. 232‚Äì234) Route Archaeological work has revealed more of its length than is in use nowadays. Its course is regarded as having run from the boundary between Ailsworth and Castor, at the north-west corner of Normangate Field, just north of the River Nene (TL113980). This is where it left the Roman Ermine Street, north-west of Durobrivae in what was by the end of the 2nd century, an extensive industrial region producing tiles, metalwork and particularly, pottery. To the south of this point, Ermine Street runs along the edge of The Fens; but to the north, lies further inland. King Street continued the course nearer the fen edge. While Ermine Street crossed the Welland near the natural ford at Stamford, King Street crosses at Lolham Bridges, which required more engineering. At Kate's Bridge, the road crossed the River Glen. Until the 1820s the road still used the same crossing point despite the river's having moved from it at some time, probably well over a thousand years before. At Park Wood, the road appears to have come close to the Car Dyke but this is not well supported by evidence. From near Thurlby crossroads, the Roman line headed straight for the point at which Bourne Abbey was later built on it. In this length, there are points where the road seems to show in the modern landscape - for example, here . In the south, the modern road lies on the Roman one which continued through Elsea Wood and along the field boundary to its north. The Car Dyke lies to the east and the boundary between Elsea Wood and Math Wood seems to lie along the edge of the 2nd century road verge, which was cleared for security. The carriageway, the Car Dyke and the Math Wood boundary are all parallel here. When allowance is made for the now-missing outer works of the Car Dyke, the carriageway lies halfway between the other two features. North of Bourne, little of the road is still in use but it has left its mark in the form of property boundaries and soil marks. This section is sometimes called the 'Long Hollow Road' because some of it runs along the bottom of the Long Hollow, a broad, shallow valley which is the upper part of the basin of the River East Glen. From Bourne Abbey, it passed along Meadowgate, then by Cawthorpe to Clipseygap Lane, Hanthorpe and the Roman town at Stainfield. On the boulder clay ridge, it forms boundaries of woods before, in the East Glen valley, its line is picked up by a minor road at Hanby. It passed through the small Roman town at Sapperton and up the Long Hollow to Ropsley Heath whence it is more or less closely followed by a modern road to its junction with Ermine Street, a kilometre south of the Roman town of Ancaster. The road can be seen as a soil mark in The Long Hollow, just right of centre in this aerial photograph. Economic significance Ermine Street was one of the strategic roads built in the 1st century, early in the period of the Roman occupation of Britannia. The features of King Street are consistent with its having formed part of a development of the region along with the Car Dyke, in the reign of Hadrian (117‚Äì138). It may well have been a result of his visit to Britannia in 122; fairly early in his reign and just after he had spent time sorting out the Limes between the Rhine and the Danube. From Bourne, the tidal waterway known to archaeologists as the Bourne‚ÄìMorton Canal and to the Middle Ages as the Old Ea, seems to have given Bourne access by boat to the sea, which lay only at the far end of Bourne North Fen. This meant that the products of the fen and coast such as salt and animal products such as fowls, meat, wool, fish and leather, could be brought across the fen which would normally have obstructed such traffic. This trade may be enough to explain the six Roman roads which radiated, directly or separating a short distance away, from the site. The Long Hollow Road and King Street were two of these, linking respectively, north and south, into the trunk road system by way of Ermine Street. Construction In an archaeological excavation of the road at the southern edge of Bourne (TF098193), where it ran across a margin between Kellaways clay and the argillaceous (clayey) Kellaways sand, it was found that the construction of the carriageway had been done by digging two parallel shallow trenches into the subsoil and over-filling them with gravel ballast so as to form kerbs. Coarse sand was used to form the carriageway between them. This was a skilful use of the available materials as south of Kate's Bridge, the road passes over such minerals but little but rather friable Cornbrash is available near the excavated site. Clearly, this part of the road was constructed from the south, northwards and the materials carried along it. However, further north, in the Long Hollow, cornbrash from Sapperton TF019239, seems to have been used (Lane p. 23.) Again, the use is north of the source. B.B. Simmons has spent much time excavating a roadside Roman town in the parish of Sapperton. His publications are listed in Lane's Ropsley and Humby book. The latter (plates 7a & b) also shows aerial photographs of the road as a soil mark around TF003367. This is the same mark as appears in photo 4 below.

Biography of Frederick William Green He worked at Hierakonpolis (ancient Nekhen), where amongst other discoveries his team found the Narmer Palette in 1898. He studied at Jesus College in Cambridge, continuing to study Archaeology and Egyptology under Kurt Sethe in G√∂ttingen and Strasbourg and then excavated sites in and around Egypt with Flinders Petrie and Somers Clarke. He worked with James Quibell at Hierakonpolis from 1897 to 1898 (and alone in 1899). He later excavated at Eileithyiaspolis with Clarke and Archibald Sayce from 1901 to 1902. He surveyed the topography and monuments of Nubia in 1906 and 1909 to 1910. Nearing the end of his career Green led the Mond excavation of the Bucheum at Armant from 1929 to 1930.

The spikelets are further grouped into panicles or spikes. The part of the spikelet that bears the florets is called the rachilla. A spikelet consists of two (or sometimes fewer) bracts at the base, called glumes, followed by one or more florets. A floret consists of the flower surrounded by two bracts, one external‚Äîthe lemma‚Äîand one internal‚Äîthe palea. The perianth is reduced to two scales, called lodicules, that expand and contract to spread the lemma and palea; these are generally interpreted to be modified sepals. The flowers are usually hermaphroditic‚Äîmaize being an important exception‚Äîand mainly anemophilous or wind-pollinated, although insects occasionally play a role. Lemma Lemma is a phytomorphological term referring to a part of the spikelet. It is the lowermost of two chaff-like bracts enclosing the grass floret. It often bears a long bristle called an awn, and may be similar in form to the glumes‚Äîchaffy bracts at the base of each spikelet. It is usually interpreted as a bract but it has also been interpreted as one remnant (the abaxial) of the three members of outer perianth whorl (the palea may represent the other two members, having been joined together). A lemma's shape, their number of veins, whether they are awned or not, and the presence or absence of hairs are particularly important characters in grass taxonomy. Palea Palea, in Poaceae, refers to one of the bract-like organs in the spikelet. The palea is the uppermost of the two chaff-like bracts that enclose the grass floret (the other being the lemma). It is often cleft at the tip, implying that it may be a double structure derived from the union of two separate organs. This has led to suggestions that it may be what remains of the grass sepals (outer perianth whorl): specifically the two adaxial members of the three membered whorl typical of monocots. The third member may be absent or it may be represented by the lemma, according to different botanical interpretations. The perianth interpretation of palea is supported by the expression of MADS-box genes in this organ during development, as is the case in sepals of eudicot plants.Prasad, K, et al. (2005) OsMADS1, a rice MADS-box factor, controls differentiation of specific cell types in the lemma and palea and is an early- acting regulator of inner floral organs. The Plant Journal 43, 915‚Äì928 Lodicule A lodicule is the structure that consists of between one and three small scales at the base of the ovary in a grass flower that represent the corolla, believed to be a rudimentary perianth. The swelling of the lodicules forces apart the flower's bracts, exposing the flower's reproductive organs.

It was founded by Hugh Fraser and William Maginn in 1830 and loosely directed by Maginn (and later Francis Mahony) under the name Oliver Yorke until about 1840. It circulated until 1882, when it was renamed Longman's Magazine. Editors In its early years the publisher James Fraser (no relation to Hugh) played a role in soliciting contributors and preparing the magazine for the press. After James Fraser's death in 1841 the magazine was acquired by George William Nickisson, and in 1847 by John William Parker. In 1863, Thomas and William Longman took over all of Parker's business. Its last notable editor was James Anthony Froude (1860‚Äì1874). In 1882, Fraser's Magazine was renamed Longman's Magazine, and was popularized and reduced in cost to sixpence. Contributors The Fraserians, 1835 group portrait by Daniel Maclise Among the contributors were Thomas Carlyle, William Makepeace Thackeray, Thomas Medwin, James Hogg, William Mudford, Janet Ross and John Stuart Mill. The 1835 group portrait by Maclise misleads in that David Brewster, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Gibson Lockhart and Robert Southey, while included, were not substantial contributors. Others who were active at that period were Percival Banks, T. C. Croker, John Galt, John Abraham Heraud, E. V. Kenealy, David Macbeth Moir, Francis Mahony, Robert Willmott and Thomas Wright. Another contributor was William Jardine Smith.

It eventually became the most powerful and pervasive style of film-making worldwide. Similar or associated terms include classical Hollywood narrative, the Golden Age of Hollywood, Old Hollywood, and classical continuity.The Classic Hollywood Narrative Style at the Department of History, University of San Diego.  Development of the classical style  = Early narrative film (1894‚Äì1913) = For centuries the only visual standard of narrative storytelling art was the theatre. Since the first narrative films in the mid-1890s, film-makers sought to capture the power of live theatre on the cinema screen. Most of these film-makers started as directors on the late 19th century stage, and likewise most film actors had roots in vaudeville or theatrical melodramas. Visually, early narrative films had adapted little from the stage, and their narratives had adapted very little from vaudeville and melodrama. Before the visual style which would become known as \\"classical continuity\\", scenes were filmed in full shot and used carefully choreographed staging to portray plot and character relationships. Cutting was extremely limited, and mostly consisted of close-ups of writing on objects for their legibility. = Maturation of the silents (1913‚Äìlate 1920s) = The Mothering Heart screenshot Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925) Though lacking the reality inherent to the stage, film (unlike stage) offers the freedom to manipulate apparent time and space, and thus to create the illusion of realism ‚Äì that is temporal linearity and spatial continuity. By the early 1910s, film- making was beginning to fulfill its artistic potential. In Sweden and Denmark, this period would later be known as a \\"Golden Age\\" of film; in America, this artistic change is attributed to film-makers like David W. Griffith finally breaking the grip of the Edison Trust to make films independent of the manufacturing monopoly. Films worldwide began to noticeably adopt visual and narrative elements which would be found in classical Hollywood cinema. 1913 was a particularly fruitful year for the medium, as pioneering directors from several countries produced masterpieces such as The Mothering Heart (D. W. Griffith), Ingeborg Holm (Victor Sj√∂str√∂m), and L'enfant de Paris (L√©once Perret) that set new standards for film as a form of storytelling. It was also the year when Yevgeni Bauer (the first true film artist, according to Georges SadoulGeorges Sadoul. –í—Å–µ–æ–±—â–∞—è –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∫–∏–Ω–æ. Moscow, Iskustvo, 1958. –¢. 3. p. 178) started his short, but prolific, career. Evgenii Bauer (1865‚Äì1917) In the world generally and America specifically, the influence of Griffith on film- making was unmatched. Equally influential were his actors in adapting their performances to the new medium. Lillian Gish, the star of The Mothering Heart, is particularly noted for her influence on screen performance techniques. Griffith's 1915 epic The Birth of a Nation was ground-breaking for film as a means of storytelling ‚Äì a masterpiece of literary narrative with numerous innovative visual techniques. The film initiated so many advances in American cinema that it was rendered obsolete within a few years.Brownlow, Kevin (1968). The Parade's Gone By..., University of California Press, p. 78. . Though 1913 was a global landmark for filmmaking, 1917 was primarily an American one; the era of \\"classical Hollywood cinema\\" is distinguished by a narrative and visual style which began to dominate the film medium in America by 1917. = Classical Hollywood cinema in the sound era (late 1920s‚Äì1960s) = The narrative and visual style of classical Hollywood style developed further after the transition to sound-film production. The primary changes in American film-making came from the film industry itself, with the height of the studio system. This mode of production, with its reigning star system promoted by several key studios, had preceded sound by several years. By mid-1920, most of the prominent American directors and actors, who had worked independently since the early 1910s, had to become a part of the new studio system to continue to work. The beginning of the sound era itself is ambiguously defined. To some, it began with The Jazz Singer, which was released in 1927 and increased box-office profits for films, as sound was introduced to feature films. To others, the era began in 1929, when the silent age had definitively ended. Most Hollywood pictures from the late 1920s to 1960s adhered closely to a genre ‚Äì Western, slapstick comedy, musical, animated cartoon, and biopic (biographical picture) ‚Äì and the same creative teams often worked on films made by the same studio. For instance, Cedric Gibbons and Herbert Stothart always worked on MGM films; Alfred Newman worked at 20th Century Fox for twenty years; Cecil B. DeMille's films were almost all made at Paramount Pictures; and director Henry King's films were mostly made for Twentieth Century Fox. Similarly, actors were mostly contract players. Film historians and critics note that it took about a decade for films to adapt to sound and return to the level of artistic quality of the silents, which it did in the late 1930s. Many great works of cinema that emerged from this period were of highly regimented film-making. One reason this was possible is that, with so many films being made, not every one had to be a big hit. A studio could gamble on a medium-budget feature with a good script and relatively unknown actors: Citizen Kane (1941), directed by Orson Welles and regarded by some as the greatest film of all time, fits that description. In other cases, strong-willed directors like Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock, and Frank Capra battled the studios in order to achieve their artistic visions. The apogee of the studio system may have been the year 1939, which saw the release of such classics as Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Stagecoach, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Destry Rides Again, Young Mr. Lincoln, Wuthering Heights, Only Angels Have Wings, Ninotchka, Beau Geste, Babes in Arms, Gunga Din, The Women, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and The Roaring Twenties.  Style  The visual-narrative style of classical Hollywood cinema as elaborated by David Bordwell,Bordwell, David; Staiger, Janet; Thompson, Kristin (1985): The Classical Hollywood Cinema. Film Style & Mode of Production to 1960. New York: Columbia University Press. 1‚Äì59 was heavily influenced by the ideas of the Renaissance and its resurgence of mankind as the focal point. It is distinguished at three general levels: devices, systems, and the relations of systems. = Devices = The devices most inherent to classical Hollywood cinema are those of continuity editing. This includes the 180-degree rule, one of the major visual-spatial elements of continuity editing. The 180-degree rule keeps with the \\"photographed play\\" style by creating an imaginary 180-degree axis between the viewer and the shot, allowing viewers to clearly orient themselves within the position and direction of action in a scene. According to the 30-degree rule, cuts in the angle that the scene is viewed from must be significant enough for the viewer to understand the purpose of a change in perspective. Cuts that do not adhere to the 30-degree rule, known as jump cuts, are disruptive to the illusion of temporal continuity between shots. The 180-degree and 30-degree rules are elementary guidelines in film-making that preceded the official start of the classical era by over a decade, as seen in the pioneering 1902 French film A Trip to the Moon. Cutting techniques in classical continuity editing serve to help establish or maintain continuity, as in the cross cut, which establishes the concurrence of action in different locations. Jump cuts are allowed in the form of the axial cut, which does not change the angle of shooting at all, but has the clear purpose of showing a perspective closer or farther from the subject, and therefore does not interfere with temporal continuity. = Systems =  Narrative logic  Classical narration progresses always through psychological motivation, i.e., by the will of a human character and its struggle with obstacles towards a defined goal. This narrative element is commonly composed of a primary narrative (e.g. a romance) intertwined with a secondary narrative or narratives. This narrative is structured with an unmistakable beginning, middle and end, and generally there is a distinct resolution. Utilizing actors, events, causal effects, main points, and secondary points are basic characteristics of this type of narrative. The characters in classical Hollywood cinema have clearly definable traits, are active, and very goal oriented. They are causal agents motivated by psychological rather than social concerns. The narrative is a chain of cause and effect with the characters being the causal agents ‚Äì in classical style, events do not occur randomly.  Cinematic time  Time in classical Hollywood is continuous, linear, and uniform, since non-linearity calls attention to the illusory workings of the medium. The only permissible manipulation of time in this format is the flashback. It is mostly used to introduce a memory sequence of a character, e. g., Casablanca.  Cinematic space  The greatest rule of classical continuity regarding space is object permanence: the viewer must believe that the scene exists outside the shot of the cinematic frame to maintain the picture's realism. The treatment of space in classical Hollywood strives to overcome or conceal the two-dimensionality of film (\\"invisible style\\") and is strongly centered upon the human body. The majority of shots in a classical film focus on gestures or facial expressions (medium-long and medium shots). Andr√© Bazin once compared classical film to a photographed play in that the events seem to exist objectively and that cameras only give us the best view of the whole play.Bordwell: 24 This treatment of space consists of four main aspects: centering, balancing, frontality, and depth. Persons or objects of significance are mostly in the center part of the picture frame and never out of focus. Balancing refers to the visual composition, i. e., characters are evenly distributed throughout the frame. The action is subtly addressed towards the spectator (frontality) and set, lighting (mostly three-point lighting, especially high-key lighting), and costumes are designed to separate foreground from the background (depth). = Relations of systems = The aspects of space and time are subordinated to the narrative element. Criticism This style of cinema is not without its critics, ranging from the lack of realism which resulted in a more post-WWII realistic cinema Legacy The New Hollywood of the 1960s‚Äì70s was influenced by the romanticism of the classical era,New Hollywood -JT Esterkamp - Medium as was the French New Wave.French New Wave: The Influencing of the Influencers - The Film Stage List of selected important figures in the era Many of the film-makers listed below did multiple chores on various film productions through their careers.

Atwater-Rhodes wrote her first novel at the age of thirteen, which earned her the title of \\"teen successor to Anne Rice.\\" At the time, she said she had over a dozen stories in various stages sitting on her shelves. In middle school, Atwater-Rhodes was questioned by an English teacher when a girl she knew proceeded to brag that Atwater-Rhodes was trying to get a book published. As it turns out, the English teacher was also a literary agent and asked to read some of her work. This teacher later represented Atwater- Rhodes.NyeusiWiki: FAQ: About the Author. Published January 22, 2009. She began writing her first novel, In the Forests of the Night, under the working title White Wine. On May 11, 1997, after her best friend, Jessica, had picked the William Blake poem, \\"The Tiger\\", the book's final title was derived. The first draft of the novel was completed in August of that year. During the writing process, Atwater-Rhodes suffered from a case of writer's block and a computer virus crashed her computer. Atwater-Rhodes spent the next four months revising the novel before she submitted the manuscript on December 31. In mid- February 1998, Atwater-Rhodes met her agent, Tom Hart, and he would go on to contact her to announce that Random House had accepted her manuscript for publication. Hart also stated that it would be published on April 14, 1998, her fourteenth birthday. The novel, however, was not published until May 11, 1999, two years after she began working on the manuscript. The novel was written in first-person narrative, a feat she did not repeat in the three later novels. Hart stated that the novel was \\"the fastest sale [he] ever had.\\" In the Forests of the Night was a huge success, gaining the attention of millions of young readers. Atwater-Rhodes spent the year making appearances in magazines and on talk shows, including The Rosie O'Donnell Show. The novel was praised highly by critics such as Publishers Weekly who called it \\"Insightful...and imaginative\\". Also during the year Atwater-Rhodes was working on the follow up to Forests called Demon in My View which was under the then working title Bitter Life. It was published in May 2000. The novel was well received by critics and was made an ALA Quick Pick for Young Adults.

Both novels were made an ALA Quick Pick. 2003‚Äì2007: The Kiesha'ra Series In 2003, Atwater-Rhodes, who so far had published novels about vampires, took a change of course and began a series of books based on a world of shapeshifters that Atwater-Rhodes would call, The Kiesha'ra Series. All the novels in the series are told in first-person narrative, a feat she had not done since her first novel. The first volume in the set of novels was released in July 2003, titled Hawksong. Despite the change in the subject topic the book was just as successful as her previous novels being made an ALA Quick Pick, it also won the School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and was selected by Voice of Youth Advocates for their \\"Best Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror\\". Hawksong tells the story of a young woman named Danica Shardae, who is a princess and hawk shapeshifter of the Avian court, who also narrates the story. She tells of how all she has known all her life is war and all that she wants is to put an end to it. The second novel in The Kiesha'ra Series, Snakecharm was released in September 2004. The novel is told by Danica's husband, Zane Cobriana, and continues where Hawksong left off. The third novel in the series, Falcondance was released in September 2005 and is told by Nicias Silvermead. The story takes place nineteen years after the events of Snakecharm. The fourth novel in the series, Wolfcry was released in September 2006. The story is told by Oliza Shardae Cobriana, the daughter of Zane and Danica. The events tell the story of her struggle trying to maintain the peace that her parents had started but she is abducted and the journey takes her through a transformation which causes her to abdicate the throne of Wyvern's Court. The fifth and final novel in the Kiesha'ra series, Wyvernhail, was released in September 2007 and takes place shortly after the events of Wolfcry. The story is told by Hai and reveals everything that was hinted at in the prior novels. All the novels in the Kiesha'ra series were well received by critics with the School Library Journey calling Hawksong \\"A stunning adventure.\\" and praising Falcondance as \\"Uniquely drawn and...vividly described\\". Voice of Youth Advocates called Snakecharm \\"Amazing.\\" and praised Atwater-Rhodes' writing abilities in Wolfcry stating that she \\"is a fantastic storyteller.\\" while calling Wyvernhail \\"Compelling and well-developed.\\" Wolfcry was giving the IRA-CBC Young Adult's Choice. 2008‚Äì2013: Return to Den of Shadows After completing The Kiesha'ra Series, Atwater-Rhodes released her tenth novel, Persistence of Memory on December 9, 2008.

Common themes and traits *The books often have misunderstood, quiet, lonesome protagonists who often have supernatural abilities along with a tough exterior and interior. (Demon in My View, Midnight Predator, Persistence of Memory) *The protagonists are usually not pristine and clean of all evil traits. They usually have had difficult or unpredictable pasts. (Demon in My View, Midnight Predator, Falcondance, Wolfcry, Wyvernhail) *The antagonists are often extremely violent, politically powerful, possess supernatural powers, think highly of themselves, and have \\"short fuses.\\" A prime example of this would be Jeshickah from Midnight Predator or Fala from Demon in My View. *Atwater- Rhodes often describes architecture and art in her work. (Wolfcry, Persistence of Memory) *Characters are often nonchalant about death and usually end up in a complicated romance by the story's end.

The road is the northernmost of three linking Southwest Florida to South Florida via the Everglades (Alligator Alley and Tamiami Trail being the other two). Due to increasing traffic, State Road 80 has experienced upgrades and widening in various sections since 2000. Route description Former SR 80 through downtown Fort Myers as First Street. The street is paved with brick to preserve the historic nature of the area. =Lee and Hendry Counties= State Road 80 begins at an intersection with US 41 (Tamiami Trail) in downtown Fort Myers. From the terminus, it runs briefly along Main Street and Monroe Street though historic downtown Fort Myers to State Road 82, where it becomes discontinuous. State Road 80 resumes at Fowler Street (US 41 Business/SR 739), where it runs east as a pair of two- lane, one-way streets weaving through central Fort Myers, with westbound lanes on First Street, and the eastbound lanes running on Second Street. The eastbound lanes rejoin the westbound lanes via Seaboard Street (a former Seaboard Air Line Railroad corridor) just east of Dean Park, forming the four- lane divided Palm Beach Boulevard. From there, it follows the Caloosahatchee River east out of the city, expanding to six lanes east of the Ortiz Avenue (CR 865) intersection in Tice. It has an interchange with Interstate 75 as it passes through the eastern suburbs of Fort Myers before being reduced to four lanes east of SR 31 before leaving Lee County and entering Hendry County. At its county seat, LaBelle, it serves as the town's main street and intersects SR 29. After LaBelle, it becomes a two-lane highway until an interchange with US 27, where the two roads run concurrently as a four-lane highway as it heads east towards Clewiston and the southern coast of Lake Okeechobee.Google Inc. (July 8, 2008). Google Earth (4.3.7284.3916) [beta]. Retrieved July 25, 2009. =Palm Beach County= SR 80, looking east In Palm Beach County, it serves as a commuter route between South Bay and Belle Glade at the western end, growing suburbs Loxahatchee, Wellington, Royal Palm Beach and county seat West Palm Beach. In South Bay, US 27 heads south towards Miami, following the North New River Canal. Between Belle Glade and Loxahatchee, the roads are surrounded by sugarcane fields, with US 441 and US 98 both joining State Road 80 during this stretch. Lion Country Safari marks the beginning of a rural to urban transition of the road for the remainder of its journey. The road doubles from four to eight lanes in Royal Palm Beach, as the road serves as the border between Royal Palm Beach and Wellington. At the State Road 7 intersection, US 441 turns south towards Miami. The South Florida Fairgrounds and the Coral Sky Amphitheater, where the South Florida Fair takes place, are next on the route, just east of SR 7. After passing Florida's Turnpike, it gains two more lanes and becomes an expressway, with diamond interchanges with Jog Road, Haverhill Road and Military Trail. East of Military Trail, it loses a lane in each direction as it straddles the southern end of Palm Beach International Airport, where private aircraft are serviced, with commercial access to the airport available via SR 704A. It then approaches a bridge over the Tri-Rail main line as it intersects Interstate 95 at Exit 68, then becomes a four-lane road in several older, high-density neighborhoods in West Palm Beach. East of the Florida East Coast Railway bridge crossing, it intersects US 1 and SR 5, reducing to two lanes as it crosses Lake Worth Lagoon on two bridges, and ending on a roundabout with SR A1A in Palm Beach near the Mar-a-Lago estate. History The route of State Road 80 was largely built in the 1920s. The first vehicle to travel the route from Belle Glade to Palm Beach was in 1923. The section from Twenty Mile Bend to West Palm Beach was considered part of the Conners Highway, which opened on July 4, 1924. Segments west of Lake Okeechobee would be completed by 1926. The route was first designated State Road 25 in 1923, running from Palm Beach to Punta Rassa. As a result of the 1945 Florida State Road renumbering, the route became State Road 80 from Fort Myers to Palm Beach, and the segment west of Fort Myers to Punta Rassa became State Road 867. (Ironically, State Road 25 still applies today to the concurrency with US 27 as that is now US 27‚Äôs hidden designation). The segment between Belle Glade and Twenty Mile Bend, designated as the Kenneth C. Mock Memorial Highway was completed in 1989, making SR 80 a four-lane divided highway between Belle Glade and West Palm Beach. Prior to this, SR 80 (and US 441) ran just to the south along what is now County Road 880. US 98, which previously ran along SR 700 (Conners Highway), would later be rerouted onto this route beginning around 2000. Until 2002, Palm Beach County's Southern Boulevard was a four-lane road with a center left-turn lane, causing high gridlock due to the rapidly growing western suburbs of Loxahatchee, Royal Palm Beach and Wellington. The road was known as \\"Killer 80\\" due to its high fatality rate.\\"Four Die in Crash on State Road 80\\". Miami Herald 23 Apr 1984: 15BR In 2002, after many years of debate, the Florida Department of Transportation embarked on a $78 million project to upgrade and widen Southern Boulevard from I-95 to US 441/SR 7.\\"As County Booms, State's Plans For Widening Roads Often Bust\\".

Eastern terminus of US 98/SR 80, Palm Beach State Road 80's routing through downtown Fort Myers has changed a few times over the years. When designated in 1945, State Road 80 terminated at First and Fowler Streets (which carried US 41 when it crossed the Edison Bridge). SR 80 would be extended through downtown in 1964 when US 41 was rerouted over the Caloosahatchee Bridge (with First Street also carrying the U.S. Route 41 Business route concurrently). In the 1980s, SR 80 was split into one-way street pairs from Monroe Street to Palm Beach Boulevard and Seaboard Street, with eastbound traffic using Second and Seaboard Streets, and with westbound traffic using First and Bay Streets. The segment between Monroe and Fowler Streets was relinquished to the city of Fort Myers on January 11, 2006 as part of the downtown redevelopment and streetscape effort, creating the gap in the route that exists today.

During this period, anyone arrested and jailed for not consistently supporting the Revolution, or suspected of being a royalist sympathizer, especially Catholic priests and nuns, was cast into the Loire and drowned on the orders of Jean-Baptiste Carrier, the representative-on-mission in Nantes. Before the drownings ceased, as many as four thousand or more people, including innocent families with women and children, died in what Carrier himself called \\"the national bathtub\\". Background Catholic clergy and √©migr√©s had been victims of angry pro-republican violence and forced deportations by sans-culottes since the Decree of 17 November 1791 went into force. However, it was the Law of Suspects () approved by the National Convention of the French First Republic on 17 September 1793 that swept the nation with \\"revolutionary paranoia\\".Jean Tulard, Jean-Fran√ßois Fayard, & Alfred Fierro, Histoire et Dictionnaire de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, √âd. Bouquins-Robert Laffont, 1997, This decree defined a broad range of conduct as suspicious in the vaguest terms, and did not give individuals any means of redress. Nantes, in particular, was besieged by the tragedies of the French civil war in the Vend√©e at its doorstep. Threats of epidemics and starvation were always present. Battles, skirmishes, and police actions led to the incarceration of more than ten thousand prisoners of war within its confines, and simply feeding them became enormous burden for the city's residents. To control the situation, the leaders of the National Convention put Jean-Baptiste Carrier, a native of the Auvergne region, in charge of obtaining food supplies for Republican soldiers in Nantes. He soon became responsible for furnishing provisions to the entire local population, as well as for maintaining order and putting down suspected royalist revolts. Fear that contagious diseases, particularly typhus, would spread from prisoners to the general population reached levels of panic in the autumn of 1793. Heavy losses of inmates' lives recorded by military personnel, physicians, nurses, and even judges, shocked civic leaders and pushed them to try anything to stop the further spread of illness. Ultimately, they chose to empty the jails in the city center and to place the inmates at the Coffee Warehouse jail at the port and on vessels moored in the harbor. Mass killings =Beginnings= The Drownings at Nantes, anonymous period painting, Mus√©e d'histoire de Nantes The first drownings happened on the night of 16 November 1793 (26 Brumaire Year II of the French Republic). The victims were 160 Catholic priests known as 'refractory clergy' () who had been arrested in the area. After being initially held at Saint-Cl√©ment Convent, they were moved in the summer of 1793 to the Carmelite Mission in Nantes because it had been converted into a prison. On 5 July, they were sent to Chantenay-sur-Loire, a district of the town immediately west of Nantes, where they were held on the barge La Th√©r√®se. The group suffered miserably from the sun and high summer temperatures. Between 19 July and 6 August, most of the priests were transferred to the friary of the Petits Capucins and the Hermitage, which also were prisons. But on 25 October, the Revolutionary Committee of Nantes ordered that the priests be sent back to the docks to be held on the barge La Gloire. On the night of the drownings, Adjutant-General Guillaume Lamberty and Fouquet moored a barge that had been specially customized by shipwrights at the docks. They directed O'Sullivan, a master of arms and his men, to transfer 90 prisoners from the La Gloire onto the adapted barge. The barge was then pulled out into the river where the priests were executed. Nearly all drowned as planned; however, three men were rescued by sailors on the warship L'Imposant who gave them spirits and warm blankets. Captain Lafloury was ordered to hand them back to the Revolutionary Committee of Nantes. After being returned to jail, the three perished with the second group of priests who were drowned the next night. Only one priest, named Father Landeau, survived the killings because, as an excellent swimmer, he managed to escape during a struggle, jump from the barge into the Loire, and swim to safety.Alfred Lalli√©, Les noyades de Nantes, 1879, p.90. The only first-person account of these first drownings was a ship's gunner named Wailly, who served on the boat La Samaritaine. He described meeting Lamberty and Fouquet who oversaw the killings. He also described hearing the desperate screams of the drowning men, rousing his comrades who heard the same cries, and the silence that came after they had died in the Loire. =Second drownings= Guillaume Lamberty oversaw the second mass drowning of priests. His guards, led by Marat Foucauld, stripped 58 clergymen who had been transported from Angers. They were again put on a specially equipped barge. But this time they were taken to the mouth of the Loire river far from the port of Nantes; as a result there were no survivors. =Escalation = On the evening of 4 December 1793 (14 Frimaire, Year II), Jean-Baptiste Carrier, key members of the Revolutionary Committee of Nantes, Fran√ßois-Louis Ph√©lippes Tronjolly and colleagues, Julien Min√©e for the department, Renard for the city, and representatives of the Soci√©t√© populaire de Nantes, all met. In the course of heated discussions, they appointed a jury to name so-called \\"criminals\\". The next day, the jury presented more than three hundred names on a list, which became orders for execution. To carry out the judgements, Carrier imagined a radical process he euphemistically called \\"vertical deportation\\": rather than deporting criminals to a remote overseas penal colony, he proposed loading the condemned onto flat bottom boats, and drowning them by casting them out in the middle of the Loire at Chantenay, an adjacent village. The executions were to be carried out at night, in secrecy, however there was concern among members of the committee that corpses would begin floating up to the surface, sometimes days later. These concerns proved to be justified. Two groups received the task of conducting the executions: Guillaume Lamberty and his men, and the Marat Company of Revolutionary Guards, known as the 'American Hussars' () due to the presence of former Black slaves and settlers from Saint-Domingue in its ranks. =Bouffay drownings= A fading 19th-century soap factory sign above the gate of the former 18th- century Coffee Warehouse jail in Nantes The third drowning, which became known as the Bouffay Drownings, took place on the nights of 14 & 15 December 1793 (24 & 25 Frimaire, Year II). Led by Jean-Jacques Goullin and Michel Moreau- Grandmaison, the Marat Company went to Bouffay Prison, most of them drunk. Unable or unwilling to consult their lists, the soldiers went at random, grabbing prisoners from their cells, stripped them of their belongings and money, before tying them in pairs to heavy rocks. Once loaded onto a flat boat, the guards sailed 129 prisoners a short distance downstream from Nantes to Trentemoult, a fishing village near the island of Chevir√©, and drowned them. =Fourth drownings= The drownings of 23 December 1793 (3 Niv√¥se, Year II) were recorded by three different accounts, with the accuracy of least two stories verified and confirmed. This time, Pierre Robin, Fouquet, and their accomplices forced approximately eight hundred captured \\"royalist sympathizers\\" of all ages and sexes onto two boats, which only sailed as far as Chantenay and drowned them. Among the most humiliating drownings were what was termed the \\"underwater marriages\\". It is a matter of dispute what constituted an \\"underwater marriage\\" or if they happened as described, but unverified accounts tell of a priest and a nun, stripped naked, then tied together before they were drowned. These drownings were also called \\"republican baptisms\\" or \\"republican marriages\\". =Galiot drownings= The next executions, from 29 December 1793 (9 Niv√¥se, Year II) to 18 January 1794 (29 Niv√¥se, Year II), were known as the Galiot Drownings (). Two-masted Dutch galiots ‚Äì small trade ships ‚Äì moored in Nantes as a result of a naval blockade, were moved on this occasion to the quay next to the Coffee Warehouse jail where the condemned could easily board. Whether the galiots made two, three, or more drowning \\"expeditions\\" is unknown, however, the lives of two hundred to three hundred victims ‚Äì men, women and children ‚Äì were lost on each sailing. At least one boat was intentionally sunk in the Loire loaded with victims in the hold and the hatches sealed.George James Hill, The story of the war in La Vend√©e and the little Chouannerie, New York: Sadlier, 1856, p.125 Records indicate that the last drownings using these Dutch vessels were organized by Carrier himself, who completely emptied out the Coffee Warehouse jail of all prisoners. These executions were perpetrated on the nights of 29 & 30 January 1794 (10 & 11 Pluvi√¥se, Year II) and involved about four hundred people. =Bourgneuf Bay drownings= Translation of a historical marker: \\"Former Coffee Warehouse Jail. During the Terror in the winter of 1793‚Äì1794, at the time of the mission of J.-B. Carrier (who was condemned to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal in Paris and guillotined on 16 December 1794), 8 to 9,000 citizens of the Vend√©e, Anjou, the Nantes region, and Poitou ‚Äì men, women, and children ‚Äì were incarcerated at this jail. Nearly all perished. Victims of starvation and typhus, shot near Gigant quarry or drowned in the Loire. ‚Äì The people of Nantes were equal prey to the Terror.\\" The final mass drownings took place on 27 February 1794 (9 Vent√¥se, Year II). According to official documents read to the National Convention in Paris on 12 October 1794 (21 Vend√©miaire, Year III), these drownings were ordered by Adjutant General Lef√®bvre resulting in 41 deaths: one 78-year-old blind man and another man, 12 women, 12 girls, and 15 children, including 10 who were only 6 to 10 years old and 5 infants. This execution took place in Bourgneuf Bay. Victims The precise number of victims is not known. According to Roger Dupuy, there were between 7 and 11 drowning executions, with 300 to 400 victims each time.Roger Dupuy, La Bretagne sous la R√©volution et l'Empire (1789‚Äì1815), Ouest-France Universit√©, 2004, p.133. According to Jacques Hussenet, 1,800 to 4,800 people drowned on the orders of Carrier, and perhaps 2,000 others drowned on the orders by other Republican revolutionaries in Nantes.Jacques Hussenet (dir.), ¬´ D√©truisez la Vend√©e ! ¬ª Regards crois√©s sur les victimes et destructions de la guerre de Vend√©e, La Roche-sur-Yon, Centre vend√©en de recherches historiques, 2007, p.458. Jean-Cl√©ment Martin wrote that between 1,800 and 4,000 people died in mass drownings.Jean-Cl√©ment Martin, Blancs et Bleus dans la Vend√©e d√©chir√©e, collection ¬´ D√©couvertes Gallimard ¬ª (n¬∫ 8), 1986, . In 1879, Alfred Lallie reported that 4,860 people were drowned confirmed by Hippolyte Taine.Hippolyte Taine, Les origines de la France contemporaine. La R√©volution : le gouvernement r√©volutionnaire, le r√©gime moderne, Edition Robert Laffont, 1896, p.224. According to Reynald Secher, 4,800 victims suffered execution by drowning just during the autumn of 1793.Reynald Secher, La Vend√©e-Veng√©: le g√©nocide franco-fran√ßais, Perrin, 2006, p.153. For Gaston Martin, about 1800 died, for Fouquet 9000 died, for Mellinet 3500 were killed.Nathalie Meyer-Sabl√©, Christian Le Corre, La Chouannerie et les guerres de Vend√©e, √âdition Ouest-France, 2007, 127 p. According to historian Reynald Secher, these murders are one component of a systematic policy of extermination (genocide) of the residents of the Vend√©e planned by the revolutionary Committee of Public Safety, and approved by a vote of the National Convention in Paris on 1 October 1793.Reynald Secher, Vend√©e, du g√©nocide au m√©moricide, √âditions du Cerf, 2011. Trial of Jean-Baptiste Carrier Although the most heinous crimes committed by Jean-Baptiste Carrier are his direction of the mass drownings at Nantes, he also was responsible for the executions by firing squads of 1,800 to 2,600 victims at a quarry in Gigant, near Nantes, and collaborated on other criminal and repressive acts that he justified by the Law of Suspects. His extreme paranoia was no more apparent than in the Affair of 132 Nantes Moderates (), a \\"tragicomedy of justice\\" that involved the round-up of more than 132 men from all walks of life vaguely accused of politically moderate 'federalism', who were imprisoned, tried in Paris, and subsequently acquitted of all charges. Carrier was recalled to Paris in early 1794 to participate in the trial of Robespierre. At first, the Thermidorians left Carrier in peace, but members of the Revolutionary Committee of Nantes soon covered him with insults and accusations. Based on overwhelming evidence, he was arrested in Paris on 3 September 1794 and indicted 27 November. At his trial, he clumsily and sarcastically stated that he knew nothing about what he was accused. However, he was immediately denounced by those closest to him and charged with the drownings, executions, butchering of women and children, thefts, acts of greed, as well as exacerbating the strife that Nantes suffered. A unanimous vote called for Carrier's execution, and he was guillotined on 16 December 1794.Comte Fleury, Carrier √† Nantes, 1793‚Äì1794, Paris: 1897Alfred Lalli√©, J.‚ÄìB.

This is the first murder mystery based on the details of a real crime. It first appeared in Snowden's Ladies' Companion in three installments, November and December 1842 and February 1843. Poe referred to it as one of his \\"tales of ratiocination\\". Plot summary 1853 illustration for \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog√™t\\" Poe's detective character C. Auguste Dupin and his assistant, the unnamed narrator, undertake the unsolved murder of Marie Rog√™t in Paris. The body of Rog√™t, a perfume shop employee, is found in the Seine, and the press takes a keen interest in the mystery. Dupin remarks that the newspapers \\"create a sensation ... [rather] than to further the cause of truth\\". Even so, he uses the newspaper reports to get into the mind of the murderer. Dupin rejects the popular theory blaming the murder on a gang of ruffians seen in the area around the time of Roget's disappearance. One of such a group, he reasons, would have certainly confessed to the crime due to fear of betrayal rather than a bothered conscience. Using the known facts in the case, Dupin further determines that a single murderer was involved. This person was probably a sailor, and dragged the victim by the cloth belt around her waist at first, then switched to a cloth around her neck, before dumping the body off a boat into the river. Finding the boat, Dupin suggests, will lead the police to the murderer. Origins The narrative is based upon the actual murder of Mary Cecilia Rogers. Rogers was presumably born in Lyme, Connecticut, in 1820, though her birth records have not survived. She disappeared on October 4, 1838, in New York City. Working at a tobacco shop, she was regarded as attractive by the male clientele and thus became known as the \\"Beautiful Cigar Girl\\". Only a few days later the newspapers announced her return. It was said she had eloped with a naval officer. Three years later, on July 25, 1841, she disappeared again. Her body was found floating in the Hudson River on July 28 in Hoboken, New Jersey. The details surrounding the case suggested she was murdered. The death of this well-known woman received national attention for weeks. Months later, the inquest still ongoing, her fianc√© was found dead, an act of suicide. By his side, a remorseful note and an empty bottle of poison were found. Writing about Rogers as a sequel to \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", Poe tried to solve the aforementioned enigma by creating a murder mystery. As Poe wrote in a letter in 1842: \\"under the pretense of showing how Dupin ... unravelled the mystery of Marie's assassination, I, in fact, enter into a very rigorous analysis of the real tragedy in New York.\\" He situated the narrative in Paris using the details of the original tragedy. Although there was intense media interest and immortalizing of a sort by Poe, the crime remains one of the most puzzling unsolved murders of New York City. Fictionalizing actual events, especially murder, was common in this period in American literature. Poe had previously fictionalized the so-called Beauchamp‚ÄìSharp Tragedy in his only play, Politian, which was left uncompleted in 1835. The sensational murder story was also fictionalized by several other writers including William Gilmore Simms and Thomas Holley Chivers. \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog√™t\\", however, was likely the first real-life crime turned into a detective story. Publication history Poe presented \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog√™t\\" by telling editors he had solved the Mary Rogers murder at a time when most readers would know the details of that event. Anxious to get it published, he offered the story to George Roberts of the Boston Notion, writing on June 4, 1842, \\"For reasons, however, which I need not specify, I am desirous of having this tale printed in Boston.\\" The same day, however, he offered the story to Joseph Evans Snodgrass of the Baltimore Saturday Visiter. The first part of the serialized story finally appeared in Snowden's Ladies' Companion in November 1842, followed by the second part in December, published in New York by William W. Snowden. An article published in the November 26, 1842, issue of the New York Tribune caused Poe to delay publication of the third installment. The newspaper reported new evidence that suggested that Rogers, the real-life victim, may have died from a botched abortion attempt, referred to as a \\"premature delivery\\". He made minor changes in his story to make a similar suggestion. A full reprint of the story in 1845 included 15 small changes to suggest he had known this as a possibility from the start. The story still ends with a recommendation to investigate a possible elopement and the attempt to throw suspicion on a gang. Critical response Of Poe's three tales of ratiocination, \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog√™t\\" is generally considered the least successful. A modern critic wrote: > It might better be called an essay than a story. As an essay, it is an able > if tedious exercise in reasoning. As a story, it scarcely exists. It has no > life-blood. The characters neither move nor speak.... Only a professional > student of analytics or an inveterate devotee of criminology can read it > with any degree of unfeigned interest. Poe's literary rival Rufus Wilmot Griswold, however, voiced a high opinion of the story and considered it an example of Poe's cunning intellect. Charles Baudelaire considered this tale as \\"a masterpiece, a wonder\\". Film adaptation In 1942 Universal Pictures produced the gothic mystery film The Mystery of Marie Roget based on the Poe story. Directed by Phil Rosen, the film starred Patric Knowles, Maria Ouspenskaya and Maria Montez. See also *C.

DTT's formula is C4H10O2S2 and the chemical structure of one of its enantiomers in its reduced form is shown on the right; its oxidized form is a disulfide bonded 6-membered ring (shown below). The reagent is commonly used in its racemic form, as both enantiomers are reactive. Its name derives from the four-carbon sugar, threose. DTT has an epimeric ('sister') compound, dithioerythritol (DTE). Reducing agent DTT is a reducing agent; once oxidized, it forms a stable six-membered ring with an internal disulfide bond. It has a redox potential of ‚àí0.33 V at pH 7. The reduction of a typical disulfide bond proceeds by two sequential thiol- disulfide exchange reactions and is illustrated below. The reduction usually does not stop at the mixed-disulfide species because the second thiol of DTT has a high propensity to close the ring, forming oxidized DTT and leaving behind a reduced disulfide bond. The reducing power of DTT is limited to pH values above 7, since only the negatively charged thiolate form -S‚àí is reactive (the protonated thiol form -SH is not); the pKa of the thiol groups is 9.2 and 10.1. Reduction of a typical disulfide bond by DTT via two sequential thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. Applications DTT is used as a reducing or \\"deprotecting\\" agent for thiolated DNA. The terminal sulfur atoms of thiolated DNA have a tendency to form dimers in solution, especially in the presence of oxygen. Dimerization greatly lowers the efficiency of subsequent coupling reactions such as DNA immobilization on gold in biosensors. Typically DTT is mixed with a DNA solution and allowed to react, and then is removed by filtration (for the solid catalyst) or by chromatography (for the liquid form). The DTT removal procedure is often called \\"desalting.\\" Generally, DTT is used as a protecting agent that prevents oxidation of thiol groups. DTT is frequently used to reduce the disulfide bonds of proteins and, more generally, to prevent intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds from forming between cysteine residues of proteins. However, even DTT cannot reduce buried (solvent-inaccessible) disulfide bonds, so reduction of disulfide bonds is sometimes carried out under denaturing conditions (e.g., at high temperatures, or in the presence of a strong denaturant such as 6 M guanidinium chloride, 8 M urea, or 1% sodium dodecylsulfate). DTT is oftentimes used along with sodium dodecylsulfate in SDS-PAGE to further denature proteins by reducing their disulfide bonds to allow for better separation of proteins during electrophoresis. Because of the ability to reduce disulfide bonds, DTT can be used to denature CD38 on red blood cells. Conversely, the solvent exposure of different disulfide bonds can be assayed by their rate of reduction in the presence of DTT. DTT can also be used as an oxidizing agent. Its principal advantage is that effectively no mixed-disulfide species are populated, in contrast to other agents such as glutathione. In very rare cases, a DTT adduct may be formed, i.e., the two sulfur atoms of DTT may form disulfide bonds to different sulfur atoms; in such cases, DTT cannot cyclize since it has no such remaining free thiols. Properties DTT is unstable in ambient atmospheric conditions as it is oxidized by oxygen; DTT should be stored and handled under inert gasses to prevent oxidation. Dithiothreitol shelf life can be extended with refrigeration at 2‚Äì8 ¬∞C. Oxidation presents further complications as oxidized DTT exhibits a strong absorbance peak at 280 nm. Since thiols are less nucleophilic than their conjugate bases, thiolates, DTT becomes a less potent nucleophile as the pH falls. (2S)-2-Amino-1,4-dimercaptobutane (dithiobutylamine or DTBA) is a new dithiol reducing agent that somewhat overcomes this limitation of DTT. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) is an alternative reducing agent that is more stable and effective at low pH, but is bulky and reduces cystines in folded proteins only slowly. DTT's half-life is 40 hours at pH 6.5 and 1.4 hours at pH 8.5 and 20 ¬∞C; its half-life decreases further as temperature increases. The presence of EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) to chelate divalent metal ions (Fe2+, Cu2+ and others) considerably increases the half-life of DTT in solution.Stevens, R; Stevens, L; Price, N. C (1983) The Stabilities of Various Thiol Compounds used in Protein Purifications. Biochemical Education, 11 (2), 70.

Birth and family James was the fourth child and second son of property developer James Burton (formerly James Haliburton) and Elizabeth Westley (12 December 1761 ‚Äì 14 January 1837), of Loughton, Essex, daughter of John and Mary Westley. The son was christened 'James Haliburton' but his father changed the family surname to Burton in 1794. The son James then changed his surname to Burton also, although he was the only member of the family to subsequently change his surname back to Haliburton (in 1838).J. Manwaring Baines F.S.A., Burton‚Äôs St. Leonards, Hastings Museum, 1956. He was an older brother of the architect Decimus Burton, the physician Henry Burton, and the gunpowder manufacturer William Ford Burton. On his father's side, his great-great grandparents were Rev. James Haliburton (1681‚Äì1756) and Margaret Eliott, daughter of Sir William Eliott, 2nd Baronet and aunt of George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield. Decimus was descended from John Haliburton (1573‚Äì1627), from whom Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet could trace his descent on the maternal side. He was a cousin of the American judge and author Thomas Chandler Haliburton, of whom he was a close friend in London between 1838 and 1844, and thence of the lawyer and anthropologist Robert Grant Haliburton and Arthur Lawrence Haliburton, 1st Baron Haliburton. James was educated at Tonbridge School, Trinity College, Cambridge (BA, 1810: MA, 1815), and Lincoln's Inn. Egyptology Between 1815 and 1822, Burton worked for the architect Sir John Soane, and travelled in Italy with Soane's secretary, Charles Humphreys, where he met Egyptologists Sir John Gardner Wilkinson, Edward William Lane, and Sir William Gell. His circle of Egyptologists also included Robert Hay and Joseph Bonomi the Younger. Burton lived in Egypt from 1820 to 1834, where he enjoyed marsala, rum, brandy, opium, and the company of slave girls. In 1820, he was part of the team that first discovered TT391. In 1822, despite having no mineralogical knowledge, he was invited by Pasha Mohammed Ali to work as a mineralogist in the Geological Survey of Egypt. He left in 1824 and started to investigate the ancient monuments of Egypt. In 1825, he travelled south on the Nile journeying to Abu Simbel. He spent several months in Thebes, excavating at Medinet Habu, Karnak and in several of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. In 1824, he made the first attempt to excavate KV20 and cleared the tomb's first chamber. In 1825, he mapped KV21. He explored also KV26, KV9, KV19, and KV2. In 1825, he became the first person to enter KV5, but only partially explored the first few chambers. In 1825, he discovered the Karnak king list. Between 1825 and 1828 Burton published Excerpta Hieroglyphica, a volume of hieroglyphic inscriptions. Little is known of Burton's activities between 1825 and 1834: he disappeared into the Egyptian desert for nine years until his father stopped his allowance and he was compelled to return to London in 1834. None of his explorations from this period have been published, but the papers of his Egyptologist companion George Greenough, which are kept at University College, London, provide information about Burton's life: \\"Besides his black slaves before mentioned he has a young Greek purchased by a Scotch renegade by the name of Osman\\", wrote Sheffield, another Egyptologist. At a birthday celebration for Charles Humphrey, Burton drank 'till he fell off his chair'. Burton was described as having 'a superb French bed with a long looking glass' and spending almost all of his time in 'coffee, smoking and drinking spiritous mixtures' in 'his divan - his harem'. Burton contracted ophthalmia, lumbago, liver problems, and a scorbutic infection, and consumed opium 'to so great a degree' that his friends feared his 'speedy madness or death'. Burton lost weight and expected to live no longer than five years: one of his friends wrote of him, 'He is reduced to a mere skeleton'. James returned to England on Christmas Day 1835 with various animals, servants and slaves including Andreana, a Greek slave girl whom he had purchased in Egypt and subsequently married, as a consequence of which he was disowned by the Burton family. However, Burton impressed the daughter of Thomas Chandler Haliburton, who wrote, in 1839, \\"Mr James I admire very much. He is one of the most well-bred persons I saw &... decidedly the flower of the flock\\". Thomas Chandler Haliburton asked Burton to check the proofs of his work Letter Bag of the Great Western, with which Burton was unimpressed, in 1839, and those of the third series of The Clockmaker in 1840. The pair travelled together to Scotland to investigate their common ancestry, and intended to tour Canada and the United States of America together. =Auctioning of property= Subsequent to his death, Burton's notebooks, containing drawings of Egyptian antiquities and plans of monuments, were presented to the British Museum by his brother Decimus Burton. These are useful as they can be compared to the condition of the archaeological sites in Egypt today. James also collected Egyptian antiquities, most of which were auctioned at Sotheby's in 1836 to repay his debts. The only item of his collection which was not auctioned was a mummy and coffin, now in the Liverpool Museum. He was a Fellow of the Geological Society of London. Burton is buried near the centre of Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. His epitaph reads \\"a zealous investigator in Egypt of its language and antiquities\\".Tour Egypt ‚Äì The Egyptologists References =Sources=  * Category:1786 births Category:1862 deaths Category:19th-century archaeologists Category:19th- century English architects Category:19th-century British male writers Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Archaeologists from London Category:English Egyptologists Category:English male non-fiction writers Category:English orientalists Category:Fellows of the Geological Society of London Category:People educated at Tonbridge School ","title":"James Burton (Egyptologist)"},{"id":"2539695","text":"Juana Briones de Miranda (1802-1889) was a pioneering resident of San Francisco, California who made a name for herself in multiple arenas of activity.

A natural entrepreneur, she marketed her milk and produce to the sailors from whaling ships or those who arrived in port for the hide and tallow trade. Briones excelled not only in business and farming: her reputation for hospitality and skills in herbal medicine and midwifery were widely recognized. She trained her nephew, Pablo Briones‚Äîwho was later known as the Doctor of Bolinas (California)‚Äîin medicinal arts, although she never received a formal education and could not read or write. Rancho Plaque commemorating the site of the home of Juana Briones de Miranda in Palo Alto. In 1844 Juana, who already had more than one home, gained a clerical separation from her physically abusive alcoholic husband and dropped his surname. That same year, she bought from two Native Californians (Jos√© Gorgonio and his son Jos√© Ramon, from the Mission Santa Clara de As√≠s) the Rancho La Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n in Santa Clara County, an area overlapping present-day Palo Alto and Los Altos Hills. From the late 1850s through the 1860s she had to fight to retain the title to her land in both San Francisco and Santa Clara counties but succeeded with the help of attorney Henry Wager Halleck. She sold part of the rancho to members of the Murphy family, who came to California with the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party. Other sections she gave to some of her children. A portion of her rancho home remained until 2011 in the foothills above Palo Alto, California at 4155 Old Adobe Road, two blocks west of the intersection of Arastradero Road and Foothill Expressway. Although most of the house dated from the early twentieth century, two walls in the oldest corner of the home exhibited the original rancho home's construction. These walls were historically significant, as they preserved a rare construction method: infilling a crib of horizontal redwood boards with adobe. This technique provided her dwelling with the excellent insulating characteristics of Adobe while protecting that building material from erosion problems during the rainy season, and destruction by earthquake, two problems with traditional adobe construction. Other than the unusual method of using materials, the original home exhibited the familiar layout of the traditional adobe: a strip of connected rooms with an external corridor. After a long legal battle with preservationists, the house was demolished in June 2011. A section of the original wall was restored and moved to the California Historical Society, San Francisco, which opened an exhibition about Juana Briones in January 2014: \\"Juana Briones y Su California: Pionera, Fundadora, Curandera,\\" presented in partnership with Stanford University, the Bancroft Library and the Presidio Trust. Death and legacy She died by a cow stampede nearby Mayfield (now part of Palo Alto, California). She is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Menlo Park, California. She left the remaining portions of her rancho to her children, who bore their father's name, Miranda. Her memory is preserved in the area in Juana Briones Elementary School, Juana Briones Park, and several street names incorporating either Miranda or first names of her children. Juana Briones, like many early Hispanic women of California, has been overlooked by traditional histories, but she was mentioned in the following sources: *Hubert Howe Bancroft, History of California *J.N.

Stanford University classes in \\"Public History and Public Service\\" in 2006 and 2009, taught by Carol McKibben, conducted research on Briones and her Palo Alto house which led to an exhibit in the Green Library in 2010 and a Juana Briones Archive within the library's Special Collections.

Many went to Florida to work in agriculture or to Key West to labor in fishing, sponging, and turtling. Two main factors that contributed to increased Bahamian migration were the poor economic climate and opportunities in the Bahamas, as well as the short distance from the Bahamas to Miami. Southern Florida developed Bahamian enclaves in certain cities including Lemon City, Coconut Grove, and Cutler. In 1896, foreign-born blacks compromised 40 percent of the black population of Miami, making Miami the largest foreign-born black city in the US aside from New York. Bahamians in Florida created their own institutions, most notably Episcopal churches. During this time in Florida, black Bahamians faced state- enforced racism. Blacks could not vote, were persecuted by epithets in Miami press, and were not allowed to stay in the hotels that employed them. In 1921, the Ku Klux Klan staged a large rally attacking these black immigrants in Miami. Between 1900 and 1920 between ten and twelve thousand Bahamians moved to Florida, mostly to do agricultural labor, often on a seasonal basis. Florida farmers convinced the U.S. Congress to exempt Caribbean and Latin American √©migr√©s from the Emergency Quota Act of 1921. Starting in 1943 Bahamanian workers came to Florida under the British West Indian (BWI) Temporary Labor Program. This program was under the control of private growers from 1947 to 1966. Growers favored Bahamanian workers because they \\"can be forced to work a regular work program or be deported.\\" Communities The majority of Bahamian Americans, about 21,000 in total, live in and around Miami, with the Bahamian community centered in the Coconut Grove neighborhood in Miami. There is also a growing Bahamian American population in the Atlanta and Oklahoma City areas. Although the majority of Bahamian Americans live in the Southern United States, a large population can be found in the New York City area, with the population particularly centered in Harlem. Bahamian Americans in the New York City area regularly provide cultural education and entertainment, particularly due to the Office of the Bahamas Consulate General in New York being located in the city. White Bahamian Americans in Florida were often referred to as \\"Conchs,\\" and their communities in Key West and Riviera Beach were sometimes referred to as \\"Conch Towns.\\" In 1939, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) conducted a study of white Bahamian Americans in Riviera Beach, eventually published as Conchtown USA. Many white Bahamians also settled in Miami, particularly in the Coconut Grove neighborhood, and in Tarpon Springs. =US communities with high percentages of people of Bahamian ancestry= The top US communities with the highest percentage of people claiming Bahamian ancestry are: # Roosevelt Gardens, Florida 9.3% # Canal Point, Florida 5.1% # Seminole Manor, Florida 3.6% # Brownsville, Florida 3.3% # Gladeview, Florida 3% # Archer, Florida 2.5% # West Park, Florida 2.1% # Ives Estates, Florida 2% # Westview, Florida 1.5% # Miami Gardens 1.4% # West Little River, Florida 1.4% Culture Bahamian Americans have retained much of their cultural heritage. Bahamian Americans listen to and perform Junkanoo and rake-and-scrape music, engage in the classic art of West Indian storytelling about characters like Anansi, and create Bahamian-style art, especially straw weaving and canvas art. Bahamian foods staples such as conch, peas and rice, Johnny cake, and desserts including duff (food)s (especially guava) continue to be made by Bahamian Americans. Bahamian dialect is also spoken by many Bahamian Americans, especially in Florida. Education As of 2010, Bahamian Americans were the most educated West Indian Americans in the USA. 39.1% of the Bahamian American population of 25 years and over held college degrees. There were 22,763 Bahamian Americans 25 years and older in the country according to the 2010 census. 9.9% held associate degrees, 17.5% held bachelor's degrees, and 11.7% held graduate or professional degrees. 29.2% held bachelor's degrees or higher.

Economy In 2010 census the average Bahamian American family household earned $61,070 annually, with the average household earning about $57,000. The median income for family household was $46,196 and the median for household was $42,000. 35 percent of working Bahamian Americans had occupations in Business, science, and arts, 27 percent had positions in sales and office occupations, 24 percent had occupation in service related jobs, 6 percent held jobs in natural resources, construction and maintenance, and 8% in production, transportation, and material moving. About 20% of the Bahamian American population were living in poverty in 2010. Organizations Both the Bahamian American Cultural Society and the Bahamian American Association Inc., the largest Bahamian American organizations in the United States, are located in Manhattan. These organizations provide cultural education services, social opportunities, and genealogical records to Bahamian Americans and those interested in Bahamian and Bahamian American culture. The National Association of the Bahamas, located in Miami, offers primarily social opportunities for the local Bahamian American community. The Council for Concerned Bahamians Abroad is a foundation which represents the interests and concerns of Bahamians, and Friends of the Bahamas domiciled outside the Bahamas. Its primary role is to serve as a voice for the economic and family interests of its constituents, and to monitor, analyze, and report on issues and policies that affect these interests. It also operates \\"Bring It Home Initiatives\\" (BIHI), projects designed to assist in the development of the Bahamas in seven areas, Education, Business & Industry, Investments & Financial Services, Health & Social Development, Community Development & Sports, Arts & Entertainment, and Tourism.
