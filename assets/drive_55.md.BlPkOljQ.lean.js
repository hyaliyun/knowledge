The tramway, built in 1902 and operated until 1907, transported timber across a neck of land between Eagle Lake and Chamberlain Lake, with one end eventually becoming the eastern terminus of the Eagle Lake and West Branch Railroad in 1927. The remnants of the tramway and rail station were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Tramway Historic District in 1979. The tramway is part of the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, a Maine state park. Description and history The remote northern interior of Maine was in the 19th-century developed as a major logging region. Because the provincial government of New Brunswick began charging tariffs for timber floated down the Saint John River, American logging interest sought ways to divert timber into the Penobscot River watershed. This was accomplished by the placement of dams in a number of places on Chamberlain Lake and Eagle Lake, whose waters historically reached the Saint John via the Allagash River, which resulted in their waters' diversion toward Webster Lake (now in the far north of Baxter State Park), part of the Penobscot watershed. By the late 19th century the lock dam between Chamberlain and Eagle Lakes had become a hindrance to logging operations. To speed the movement of timbers between the two lakes, the ingenious solution of a cable-drawn steam-powered tramway was implemented. At a neck of land about north of the dam, a pair of tracks was laid across the neck (about ), and a continuous wire cable loop in length was attached to lumber-carrying trucks. The tramway was powered by large steam boilers located at the Chamberlain Lake end, and was capable of transporting logs at per minute, averaging more than 500,000 board-feet of lumber over a typical working day. The tramway was rendered obsolete by the invention of the Lombard Steam Log Hauler, and ceased operation in 1907. Prior to the tramway, oxen hauled wood between Eagle and Chamberlain Lakes. In 1927 the Eagle Lake end of the tramway was adapted as the eastern terminus of the Eagle Lake and West Branch Railroad, a freight- only operation for hauling timber southward. The railroad operated until 1933; the only major surviving element of its operation are two locomotives, which are vandal-stripped and exposed to the elements. Of the tramway, the cable and elements of its tracks survive, collapsing into the ground as the ties deteriorate, and elements of the steam power plant remain at Chamberlain Lake. The area is now part of the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, a Maine state park. In 2012, part of the tramway was restored by volunteers.http://bangordailynews.com/2012/09/09/news/aroostook/volunteers- bring-old-allagash-tramway-back-to-life/ See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Piscataquis County, Maine References Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Piscataquis County, Maine Category:Defunct Maine railroads Category:Maine logging railroads Category:North Maine Woods Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1902 Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Piscataquis County, Maine ","title":"Eagle Lake Tramway"},{"id":"46232893","text":"Grand Morbid Funeral is the fourth studio album by Swedish death metal band Bloodbath.

A follow-up to the 2012 action role-playing game Dragon's Dogma, the game had the player take the role of an \\"Arisen\\" in service to the White Dragon, charged with defending the land of Lestania from monster attacks. Gameplay carried over the basic battle and Pawn companion systems from Dragon's Dogma while incorporating features of the MMORPG genre. The game was conceived in 2012 alongside Dark Arisen, an expanded version of Dragon's Dogma. Development was delayed into 2013 due to the development of Dark Arisen. Returning staff included director Kento Kinoshita, producer Minae Matsukawa and composer Tadayoshi Makino. The scenario was written by Kazushige Nojima, noted for his work on the Final Fantasy series. The game reached one million downloads within a month of its release, and was positively reviewed. Gameplay A player character fighting a dragon, a powerful boss enemy. Dragon's Dogma Online was a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) where players take on the role of the \\"Arisen\\", a warrior of the White Dragon who defends the land of Lestania from monsters. The Arisen is a customizable avatar created by the player at the beginning of the game, with their gender, physique and other features such as their voice being customizable. The game's hub is the White Dragon Shrine, with the rest of Lestania being available for exploration following the opening quest. Players progressed through the game by completing quests, which were accepted from the game's non-playable characters and divided into three categories; main quests connected to the central narrative, World Quests which were multiplayer-exclusive quests where up to eight players would cooperate during the quest; and Solo Quests which one player can complete. Quests gave experience and monetary rewards, and were gated based on the Arisen's current experience level. The Arisen uses a character class, which unlock different combat and support options to use in battle, in addition to giving passive abilities. The basic class types are the \\"Fighter\\", close-range melee-based character builds focusing on attacking; the \\"Hunter\\", which can attack from a distance using bow and arrow; the \\"Priest\\", which specialises in healing and magic; and the \\"Tank\\", which has high defence abilities and can draw enemy attention. Players choose a class upon creating their Arisen character, and can change their job at the White Dragon Shrine. Some quests the player can complete are exclusive to certain classes. Combat uses a similar real-time action-based battle system to the original Dragon's Dogma. Encountering enemies during exploration, and have particular vulnerabilities to different classes; some enemies are giants which can be climbed by the Arisen. Monsters have varying experience levels, which affect how much damage the Arisen can deal during combat. Each enemy has weak points which can be attacked for high damage, with some boss encounters relying on these mechanics. Each enemy has a fatigue and stamina meter, both relating to their energy and attack power. Depleting and manipulating these meters allow players to deal higher damage. Smaller enemies can be grappled and held down by allied combatants. Alongside the Arisen, players create a human-like companion dubbed a Pawn to accompany them on their quest. Like the Arisen, the Pawn is a customizable avatar summoned into the world at the beginning of the game, assigned a gender, general appearance and class. The Pawn accompanies the Arisen on their quests, and aids them in combat. When knocked out in battle, the Pawn can be revived within a short time. If allowed to completely pass out, they are removed from the battlefield and retreat to a place in the world where Pawns gather, where the player can summon them again. Synopsis Dragon's Dogma Online takes place in the land of Lestania. The overall narrative, focused on the roles in the world of five powerful dragons, was originally planned out in five story phases or \\"seasons\\". Due to the discontinuation of the game, the storyline had to finish at the third chapter. For as long as its people can remember, Lestania has been protected by the White Dragon, who helped humanity prosper until a Golden Dragon challenged it to combat three hundred years prior to the game's opening. After three days of continuous battle, the Golden Dragon was killed, but the White Dragon was seriously injured during the battle. To compensate for its weakened state, the White Dragon turns select humans into \\"Arisen\\", warriors who share the White Dragon's power and carry out its will in defending Lestania. The performance and adherence to the White Dragon's will is referred to as the \\"Dragon's Dogma\\". The player character, a newly-created Arisen, is commanded by the White Dragon to defend Lestania from monster attacks, which have increased as the White Dragon's power wanes. An Arisen also has the potential to become a new Dragon when needed. The initial phase of the story focuses on the Arisen confronting the failure of a key defensive fortress that has kept monsters and demons at bay for centuries. The monsters, having constructed a powerful airship dubbed the Ark, are able to launch powerful attacks on Lestania, forcing the Arisen and the White Dragon's army to fight for survival. It is eventually revealed that an evil alchemist called Diamantes has recreated the Golden Dragon as a weapon for the monster army. Infiltrating the ruined city of Margoda, the Arisen and their party defeat both Diamantes and his Golden Dragon, stalling the monster invasion. This victory prompts the White Dragon to awake for the first time in centuries, prompting general rejoicing in Lestania. Their ally Leo, the planned successor of the White Dragon's power, leaves for other lands. The second story phase begins six months later. The Arisen helps a young amnesiac girl named Cecily, defending her from a black knight who seeks her death. Coinciding with her arrival is a fungus-like blight which begins infecting Lestania. Cecily eventually regains her memories, revealing herself to be an Arisen serving the Spirit Wilmia, guardian to the neighbouring realm of Findam. Travelling to Findam, they find the blight has infected both Wilmia and the magical trees which maintain the land's balance. While the Great Tree is purified, the Arisen's party are forced to kill the despairing Wilmia to encourage the birth of a new dragon. Their task complete, the Arisen's group returns to the purified Lestania. The third story phase begins when the White Dragon's domain is attacked by the \\"Dragon's Eye\\", a powerful projection from an evil dragon currently ruling the nation of Acker Chelan after killing its native Fire Dragon. The Arisen and their companions are kidnapped by the power, arriving to find Acker Chelan in a state of apathetic despair after years under the evil dragon's rule. Acker Chelan's last hope is Ned; as an Arisen and last surviving prince of the land's royal line, he is destined to become the next Fire Dragon. The Arisen works with Ned and Acker Chelan's surviving resistance force to overthrow the evil dragon and its monster armies. The Arisen and their allies are then confronted by the black knight, who is served by Leo. The fourth Water Dragon has been defeated, and the black knight's master the Black Dragon is preparing a full-scale invasion. In the final section of the game, the Arisen and the White Dragon unite the power of the remaining Dragons. Leo also surrenders his power of the Water Dragon to the Arisen, and with their united powers defeats the Black Dragon. In the epilogue, the Arisen is chosen as the revitalised White Dragon's successor. Development The concept for Dragon's Dogma Online was created in 2012 following the release of the original Dragon's Dogma. Capcom received a lot of comments from players who wanted to play together using a full multiplayer option, which was not present in Dragon's Dogma despite it sporting online elements through its Pawn sharing systems. Due to the development efforts invested in Dark Arisen, an expanded version of the original game, production on Dragon's Dogma Online had to be halted. Rather than a true sequel, Dragon's Dogma Online was designed as an expansion and refinement of the original concept. The producer Minae Matsukawa and director Kento Kinoshita had previously worked on Dark Arisen. Hiroyuki Kobayashi acted as executive producer. The development team were carried over from Dragon's Dogma. The scenario was written by Kazushige Nojima, who had gained fame due to his writing work on the Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series. Nojima was brought on board the project in 2013 by Matsukawa, who had worked with him on Last Ranker. The music was composed by Tadayoshi Makino, who worked on the original game, and Azusa Kato, who worked on Resident Evil 6 and Sengoku Basara 4. Dragon's Dogma Online was Makino's last project for Capcom before going freelance. Acting as music director for the project, he found composing the music challenging despite the established style of Dragon's Dogma, as he needed to both appeal to series fans and draw in newcomers. The aim was to recreate the gameplay systems of Dragon's Dogma within the MMORPG genre. While a monthly fee was considered, Capcom decided to make the game free-to-play so as to increase its potential player base. While the concepts of the Arisen and Pawn were carried over directly from Dragon's Dogma, the rest of the game was new. The scenario was written as a set of seasons similar to a television series, planned for release over five years. The game was Capcom's first MMORPG, which led to several issues creating a sustainable online server and multiplayer structure while also preserving the gameplay systems of Dragon's Dogma. The game runs on an updated version of Capcom's MT Framework, which they had previously used for Dragon's Dogma. Dragon's Dogma Online and its platforms PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows were first announced in January 2015. The game supports cross-platform play between its console and PC versions. The cross-platform feature was used so people could interact with each other no matter what system they used. The game was released on August 31, 2015, preceded by alpha and beta testing periods/ The game came in standard and limited editions. While Capcom attempted to keep the game running to satisfy all players, this became increasingly difficult. In July 2019, the company announced that the game service would be discontinued on December 11 of that year. Reception The Limited Edition of Dragon's Dogma Online for PlayStation 3 debuted in Japanese game sales charts in fourth place with sales of over 29,000 units. The PS3 version reached twelfth place with over 8,000 units sold. Across all platforms, the game received over 700,000 downloads a day after its release. Within ten days of its release, the game had received one million downloads in Japan.

It was designed by local architect Fred L. Savage and built in 1895, and is a particularly opulent example of Colonial Revival architecture. A later owner of the property was New York City mayor Abram Hewitt. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and as part of the Harbor Lane-Eden Street Historic District in 2009. Description and history Reverie Cove is set near the end of Harbor Lane, overlooking Frenchman Bay and eastward toward the village center of Bar Harbor. It is a large frame house 2-1/2 stories in front and 3-1/2 in back, with a complex hip roof, three brick chimneys, wooden shingle siding, and a granite foundation. The main facade faces west (away from the water), and is five bays wide, with projecting portico-like sections at both ends. Stylistically identical, one shelters the main entrance, while the other is a covered porch. Both are topped by recessed balconies, and are supported by paired large square columns. Between these porticos are a band of four diamond-pane sash windows, with a large round-arch diamond-pane window at the second level. Between this large window and the recessed balconies there are small half-round windows. At the outer corners of the facade are slightly projecting sections topped by hip-roof sections with eyebrow dormers. The half-story between these projections also has a low- profile hip-roof dormer. The eastern facade, facing the water, is also elaborate, with recessed balconies under arches at the center of the third level, and projecting semi-circular balconies at the second. Reverie Cove was designed by local architect Fred L. Savage, noted for designing a number of Bar Harbor's other summer estate houses, and was completed in 1895. It was built for Dr. John Davies Jones of Washington, D.C. After Jones died in 1903, the house was purchased by Abram and Sarah Hewitt; he served as Mayor of New York City 1887-88. The property was one of a modest number of Bar Harbor's estate houses to survive a devastating 1947 wildfire ravaged the eastern half of Mount Desert Island. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and was included in the Harbor Lane-Eden Street Historic District in 2009.

KAP is one of the province's most active lobby groups and is a member organization of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. KAP was formed in 1984 to replace the former Manitoba Farm Bureau, and is headquartered in Winnipeg, Manitoba  Activities  The organization lobbies government and industry on issues that affect Manitoba farmers. For example, KAP was part of the effort to develop legislative sanctions for Canadian railways that failed to transport minimum grain volumes for farmers in 2013. As a result, the Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway were fined a combined $150,000, and the federal government brought in the Fair Rail for Grain Farmers Act in 2014, which required railways to move a minimum amount of grain per week. KAP uses the news media bring attention to issues facing producers. During heavy flooding in 2014 when nearly 2 million acres in the province were lost to water damage, KAP was vocal in the media about the need for better crop insurance coverage. KAP promotes agriculture‚Äôs contributions to Manitoba and Canada.

Sarfaraz represented India in the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2014 and 2016. He is an aggressive right handed batsman and a part-time spinner. He is the youngest player to play an IPL match and is the only uncapped player to be retained by a franchise in the IPL. As a 15-year old in 2012, he was mentionined in to the prestigious Wisden Cricketers' Almanack along with his younger brother Musheer.  Early life and background  Sarfaraz was born and brought up in the suburbs of Mumbai. He spent most of his childhood in Azad Maidan. There Naushad Khan, his father and coach, nurtured young cricketers such as Iqbal Abdulla and Kamran Khan. His coaching began at an early age when his father discovered his talent of timing the ball well. In monsoon conditions it was difficult for him to reach the maidan (grounds) from his home in the suburbs, so a synthetic pitch was laid besides his house for practice. \\"Not only does it save our time and energy but it has also helped him get used to bouncier wickets that he will have to deal with later on,\\" his father commented. He was unable to attend school for 4 years due to his cricket commitments, so a private tutor was employed for his maths and English classes. Youth and domestic career He came into the limelight when he broke the 45-year-old record of Sachin Tendulkar by scoring 439 off 421 balls in a Harris Shield game. It was his maiden Harris Shield game in 2009 when he was just 12 years old. He was playing for his school, Rizvi Springfield. The innings included 56 fours and 12 sixes. He soon started playing for the Mumbai Under-19 team and his performance for them led to selection for the Indian Under-19 team. In 2013, he scored a match-winning 66 ball 101 against South Africa Under 19s, which included 17 fours and a six. Bharat Arun, the then head coach of the India Under 19 team, commented that: \\"He is a gusty player, who reads the situation well. He has shots all around the wicket and looks even better when playing straight. He uses his feet well and plays cheeky strokes too.\\" Sarfaraz played for India in two Under-19 World Cups (2014 and 2016). The 2014 Under-19 World Cup was played by 16 teams in a round robin format where India finished at the 5th position. He scored 211 runs in six games at an average of 70.33; two innings were fifties, and he ended up a strike rate of 105.5. Following this performance, IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore bought him for 5 million for the 2015 season. India finished as runners up in the 2016 Under 19 World Cup in Bangladesh. In the tournament Sarfaraz finished as the second highest run scorer. He scored 355 runs from six innings, with five scores of over 50, at an average of 71. At the Under-19 level he has the record for most number of fifties in World Cups (7 fifties across two World Cups). Sarfaraz started his Ranji career with Mumbai when he played against Bengal in 2014. He started playing for Uttar Pradesh from the 2015‚Äì2016 season. By September 2019 he had played 11 first- class matches and has scored 535 runs with the highest score of 155. He had also played 12 list A matches and had scored 257 runs at a strike rate of 96.25. In January 2020, in the 2019‚Äì20 Ranji Trophy match against Uttar Pradesh, Sarfaraz scored his maiden triple century in first-class cricket.  Controversies In 2011, a school team accused him of being overage. Bone tests showed him to have an age of 15 but according to the birth date registered with the Mumbai Cricket Association he was 13 years old. Sarfaraz and his father went for a second, advanced test. This time the resulting age matched with the registered birth date. Sarfaraz himself was disturbed by this controversy and it effected his emotional health. It took him two to three months to get his focus back on cricket. In 2015, Sarfaraz made some offensive gestures to the selectors after leading Mumbai to a victory in the Under-19 championship semi-final. As a consequence, he was dropped from the team and along with Suryakumar Yadav his match fees for two years were withhold as an assurance for his good behavior.  IPL career After a good performance in the 2014 Under-19 World Cup, Sarfaraz was bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in 2015 for 5 million. At an age of 17, he is the youngest player to have ever participated in an IPL match. In his debut game against Chennai Super Kings, he scored 11 runs off 7 balls. With the trio of Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle and AB de Villiers dominating in the next two matches he did not get a chance to bat. In the next match he outshone the trio of more established batsmen, scoring 45 runs off 21 balls against Rajasthan Royals. The innings included six fours and a six and helped RCB post a large total. Virat Kohli bowed down to him while he was walking back to the dressing room at the end of the innings. In total in the IPL season for 2015, he played 13 matches and scored 111 runs at a strike rate of 156.33. He started the 2016 season quickly when he played a cameo of 35 runs off 10 balls against Sunrisers Hyderabad. In the 19th over he attacked the bowling of Bhuvaneshwar Kumar, the best bowler of the tournament and scored 4 fours and a six. His teammate Chris Gayle commented that \\"He's too young and he's like a son to me. He's definitely one for the future and one must keep an eye on him.\\" He kept on having short, eventful innings in the 2016 season for RCB. Eventually he was dropped from the team due to his lack of fitness. In 2016 he ended up played 5 matches and scored 66 runs at a strike rate of 212.90. In the 2017 season he injured his leg during a training session and had to miss the entire season. In a surprising move, RCB retained Sarfaraz over the likes of Chris Gayle, K L Rahul and Yuzvendra Chahal for the 2018 season. Sarfaraz had a poor season and managed to score only 51 runs from six innings at a strike rate of 124.39. He was eventually released by RCB ahead of the 2019 season. Kings XI Punjab picked him up for the next season for just 2.5 million. Having his former RCB team-mates like K L Rahul, Chris Gayle and Mandeep Singh helped him through this transfer. He scored 180 runs from eight matches at an average of 45 and a highest score of 67 runs.

Captured by the Nazi she was sent to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. After the liberation Suzanne Hiltermann moved to China in the 1960s. She came back to France and retired in Ard√®che next to Chambon-sur-Lignon. To reward her fight for freedom and for the saving of many allied pilots during the Second World War, President Harry S. Truman gave her the Medal of Freedom (1946). Early life Suzanne Hiltermann was born in a family of magistrates and industrialists. At the age of 20, she left Holland, to study ethnology in Paris. Shortly after the German invasion of France, she joined the French Resistance. World War II Dutch-Paris Resistance Network In 1943, Suzanne joined the resistance Dutch-Paris network. This movement was founded by a Dutch diplomat Herman Laatsman and led by an industrialist, Johan Hendrik Weidner. It operated in direct coordination with the Allied forces. After saving the life of more than 1000 Jews persecuted by the Nazi Force, The r√©seau specialized in saving Allied pilots shot down in continental Europe, helping them to return to their bases. Through the connections established by Touty within the German Embassy, in particular with Karl-Heinz Gerstner, the Dutch-Paris network received confidential information and forged papers. As air missions increased, and more planes were shot down, Suzanne Hiltermann was more involved in all the operations needed first for sheltering the pilots and then for moving them out of the Nazi controlled areas. Touty accompanied several groups of pilots to the Gare d'Austerlitz to join the train for Toulouse, from where they would escape through Pyrenees to Spain. According to statistics from the US Department of Defence, more than 120 pilots were saved. According to the historian Megan Koreman, \\"Between 1942 andc1944, the Dutch-Paris escape line, what Americans would call underground railroad, rescued approximately 3,000 people from the nazis\\"Megan Koreman, Wars Long Shadow, Notre Dame Magazine Spring 2220 P.31. Denunciation Leo Marc Mincovschi worked as an interpreter at the German Embassy. He informed Touty, on her return from Toulouse, that Suzy Kraay had been arrested by French police on February 10 and that the network was blown. Both rushed to the apartment of Touty, on Laos Street, to destroy all evidence, papers, clothes and other incriminating objects. Touty then contacted Hermann Laatsman and Captain Weidner. Both thought that there was no reason for alarm: \\"It's simply a black market story. There is nothing to fear\\". February 26 began with a Gestapo dragnet that led to the arrest of all members of the Dutch-Paris network apart from Captain Weidner who managed to flee. Touty was arrested on February 27, 1944. She was interned in Fresnes and Romainville. After several brutal Gestapo interrogation sessions, she was deported to Ravensbr√ºck in the convoy of 18 April 1944. Deportation Genevi√®ve de Gaulle-Anthonioz was one of Touty's fellow inmates and friends at Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. Her son Michel (one of the founders of the Arte television channel) later reported his mother's memories of those times: \\"She never spoke of the camp, but it was a continuous presence, every second of her life\\" (\\"... il √©tait pr√©sent √† chaque seconde de sa vie \\") In the cattle wagon that transported the prisoners across Germany, Jacqueline Pery remembered Touty as one of the few prisoners who had a clear idea of what to expect. She had spent most of her youth living relatively near the German border. She spoke German fluently, and had read \\"Mein Kampf\\" before the war had started. Having heard and understood the meaning of Chancellor Hitler's speeches, having maintained close connections with anti-Nazi Germans after 1940, and having frequently escorted persecuted Jews to the Swiss border, she was well informed about the hellish universe that awaited them. White buses drive through Odense on the way to Sweden At the camp, she remained in the block occupied by the French. Life and work were very hard (see in the detailed testimony of her friend Jacqueline Pery de la Rochebrochard). When her 17 year old future sister in law, Simone Souloumiac, with whom she shared a workbench, showed her despair, Touty whispers to her: \\"Hold on! We need to see the end of the movie‚Äù. President of the Swedish Red Cross, Count Folke Bernadotte is approached by Himmler to discuss a \\"peace of the brave\\" with the Allies. During his second interview with Heinrich Himmler, the Count requires the freedom of some women detained at Ravensbr√ºck. Himmler finally gives his consent. The camp commander Suhren finally accepts, not without major difficulties. The orders of Himmler appear to contradict those of total extermination given by the F√ºhrer. The Bernadotte operation is conducted by a Swedish doctor, Dr Arnoldson. On April 23, 1945, seventeen white buses drove three hundred Belgian, Dutch and French women to G√∂teborg. Liberation Touty returned to France aboard a special aircraft of the US Air Force. A few months later she married the brother of Simone Souloumiac, Pierre Souloumiac, Captain of the Merchant Marine. In 1951, Pierre Souloumiac joined the Ministry of Merchant Marine where he worked on the drafting of the Code on the transport of dangerous goods. The couple had three children: Anne- Genevi√®ve, Ir√®ne et Alain Souloumiac. They then settled in an old farmhouse in the hamlet of Balizy, 23 kilometers south of Paris. Touty often received her old friends from the camp, including Germaine Tillion.Germaine Tillion, Algeria in 1957, editions de minuit. They have long discussions about the Algerian War of Independence. During one of their conversations, they invented the new concept of \\"clochardisation\\" to describe the terrible marginalization that affects a large part of the human species. They sympathized with the Algerians rebels who were fighting the French. Their past lead them to denounce torture and to favor independence. Close to General de Gaulle, Germaine Tillion was one of the few interlocutors who were able to convince him of the need for the independence of Algeria. This was achieved by the signature of the √âvian Accords between the French government and the Algerian rebels. Her husband Pierre died on 3 February 1956. Touty then passed through a difficult period. She published tales for children.S.

Little, 1943‚Äì54: An Eyewitness ..., Volume 2 By Chihyun Chang who, Minister Plenipotentiary in China advised his country, despite the opposition of the United States to recognize China after the revolution of 1947. Taking advantage of the support of his father and of his wife, Baron Albrecht Van Aerssen is sent shortly after his marriage to Hong Kong by the Dutch Crown, where he becomes Consul General. French School To educate the children in the small French colony, Touty founded a school in 1963. At the beginning, the school occupied every morning three rooms in the premises of the French Alliance in Hang Seng Bank Building on Des Voeux Road. It worked with some volunteer teachers, most of whom came from the consulate of France which offices were located a few floors below. The Commandant Hou√´l, the Military Attach√©, handled mathematics. The Reverend-P√®re Chagny taught literature. Pierre-Jean R√©my was the first history teacher. With the support of ‚Äúcorrespondence courses‚Äù of CNTE from Vanves, little by little, the school started to grow 1 200 students are today studying at the Lyc√©e Victor Segalen Hong Kong which became Asia's largest French high school.Fran√ßois Dremeaux, Hong Kong, French Attendance, Bonham Books, 2013, p. 212 In February 1964, Touty and her children left the British enclave aboard Laos, a ship chartered by the Messageries Mar√Ætimes. The same year, Touty divorced Baron Van Aerssen. Following the opening of universities which was provoked by the events of May 1968, she took Chinese studies at Jussieu. The recognition of China by France In 1963 Touty receives the visit of Bernard Anthonioz, Counsellor of Andr√© Malraux and husband of her friend Genevi√®ve de Gaulle. Several talks relate in particular to the future mission of Edgar Faure - who General Charles de Gaulle intends to send in Peking for the recognition of China by France. Touty strongly supports the interest of France to take such a decision. Unlike many other people of her generation, she does not consider the communists as enemies. Many of her friends in the resistance belonged to the Communist movement. She believes in a sustainable alliance of great nations beyond changes and political evolutions. She repeats the arguments her father in law, Baron Fran√ßois Cornelis Van Aerssen, had issued 16 years earlier to convince the Dutch Crown. Her friend Bernard is conquered. Discussions go very far. They consider the historical dimensions of such recognition, to contain and resolve the Vietnam war. The composition of the first team who will represent France in Beijing is evoked. Touty recommends the quality of Pierre-Jean R√©my, then vice-consul in Hong Kong. He will later be admitted to the French Academy because of the importance of his work in China. The personality of the first ambassador of France in Beijing is also considered (Lucien Paye). Nien Cheng The same year, she meets and becomes friends with Nien Cheng, an exceptional Chinese woman. As a sign of gratitude for their first discussions on China, the arts and the meaning of life, Nien Cheng offers to Touty four paintings by great masters of Chinese painting, including a Qi Baishi. Back in Europe, Touty learns the abuse her friend and her daughter are subjected by the Red Guards. Cheng's daughter, Meiping is a bright and promising actress. Brutalized an entire day by the Red Guards, while she has not yet twenty, Meiping returns in the evening to the apartment she shares with her mother in Shanghai. When pressed by Nien Cheng, she admits the brutal treatments that were inflicted to her, as \\"'dirty daughter of a mother serving bourgeois‚Äô imperialism.'\\" At that time, her mother represents in China the Shell Company. The guards wanted Meiping to condemn her mother. Nien is in tears. Meiping replies: \\"But, Mom, they can hit as hard as they want, the truth will remain and they will be unable to change anything.\\" Soon after, in early 1967 Touty learns that Nien has been arrested and deported. She then writes a letter to Chairman Mao Zedong to beg him to free her friend. In vain. Nien underwent several years of captivity in harsh re-education camps. Nien renews relations with Touty soon after leaving the camp. In 1980, the United States and Canada where she emigrated, Nien writes long letters to Touty about the memories of this torment. From the mountains of the Ard√®che, where it is housed, Touty relives in these sad episodes some of the agonies she suffered in the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. To write is release. She suggests to her Chinese friend to write a book. Nien is persuaded. She asks her to read some of her chapters as she writes. The book is published in 1987 under the title Life and Death in Shanghai. It experienced considerable international success.The newspaper article Monde http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2009/11/16/nien-cheng-victime-de- la-revolution-culturelle-chinoise_1267792_3382.html Last years Van Waveren family led her to discover the Ard√®che region where she moved in 1981.

It was discovered on 4 March 2008, by astronomers of the Mount Lemmon Survey at Mount Lemmon Observatory near Tucson, Arizona, United States.  Origin and orbital history  started its existence as part of a much larger body in the asteroid belt, with a likely diameter greater than 100 kilometers. 's immediate history likely started when its parent body experienced a large cratering event or, more likely, a catastrophic disruption event that resulted in a highly fractured, shattered, or reaccumulated object (rubble pile). As a result, may have been produced as a reassembly of ejected fragments. The location of what is now within this parent body is unknown. Given the available modeling work and data, the most plausible source family candidates for are Eulalia, New Polana, and Erigone. This assumes that 's true albedo is considerably lower than 10%. If it does have a high albedo, a plausible source would be a population of high-albedo C-type asteroids in the inner asteroid belt. Second tier candidate families for the high-albedo case are Baptistina and Pallas. From here, the newly liberated began to change via the forces referred to as the Yarkovsky and YORP effects. The Yarkovsky effect describes a small force that affects orbital motion. It is caused by sunlight; when objects heat up in the Sun, they reradiate the energy away as heat, which in turn creates a tiny thrust. This recoil acceleration is much weaker than solar and planetary gravitational forces, but it can produce substantial orbital changes over timescales ranging from many millions to billions of years. The same physical phenomenon also creates a thermal torque that probably caused to take on a top-like appearance. Dynamical models indicate that migrated inward across the inner asteroid belt over long timescales (i.e. the order of ~0.01‚Äì1 Gyr) until it reached a planetary gravitational resonance that drove it into the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population over a timescale of the order of ~1 Myr. From there, gravitational interactions with both the planets and resonances allowed it to reach its current orbit within a few Myr to a few tens of Myr.  2008 close approach  On 23 December 2008, made a close approach to Earth at a distance of 8.4 lunar distances (0.022 AU, 3.2 million km), its closest until 2169. Its brightness peaked on 26 December about 13.2 magnitude. Path of close approach, with 3 day motion markers  Physical characteristics  Radar-based shape model of is an oblate spheroid (also described as \\"muffin-shaped\\") in diameter. It rotates very slowly in a retrograde direction. There is a diameter concave feature, possibly an impact crater, or a relic feature from a previous episode of rapid rotation that caused the asteroid's shape to reconfigure. Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy show that 's composition is similar to that of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.  Sample return mission  was the preliminary baseline target of NASA's proposed sample-return Asteroid Redirect Mission. Besides , several other asteroids, including Itokawa and Bennu, were considered for this mission, before its cancellation in 2017.

The company currently runs 14 language schools and operates in the UK, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France and Switzerland offering general and specialised language courses in English, French and German. History Language Studies Ltd was founded in 1965 by an ex-army education officer, who opened the inaugural language school in Kensington, London in premises previously occupied by the Thai Embassy. A few years later the company was purchased by the Thomson Corporation, former owners of The Times and Sunday Times magazine, who expanded the company adding a second school in Paris. Both schools provided one-to-one tuition in a range of languages to private individuals. In 1970 Language Studies Ltd was bought by the Immanuel family. The new owners relocated the London school to Oxford Street and recognising a niche in the market began providing language training to large corporations and government departments. New mini group courses, ‚ÄòGroup 5‚Äô, were set up in larger premises opened in Hampstead in 1975 and a few years later in Brighton. In the late 1970s Language Studies (or Language Studies International as it became known in 1987) began to focus on ESL teaching and the provision of study abroad programmes . In 1980 LSI started a joint venture with The Two Cities Club in Zurich, Switzerland and in the same year opened the first US school in Berkeley, California. According to Language Studies International's CEO, David Immanuel, LSI was one of the first British language schools to expand into North America and to offer study abroad programmes with a homestay option.. This decision to expand into the North American market was prompted by the availability of cheap ‚Äòwalk on‚Äô air fares offered by the airline TWA. \\"I thought that this might be the time for young Europeans to diversify from UK schools when preparing for the [Cambridge] FCE and so it proved when we opened in Berkeley, California,\\". LSI opened a school in Christchurch in New Zealand in 2006 but following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake many buildings in the surrounding Central Business District were designated as unsafe, preventing access to the school. Students were relocated to the school in Auckland but the long term viability of the school was severely affected causing the permanent closure of the school in 2011 In September 2016, following a partial merger with LTC, LSI acquired additional school premises in Brighton and closed down the LTC schools based in London. Language training for juniors In 2012, in response to growing demand for language programmes for juniors, LSI developed specially adapted programmes targeted at younger learners. Following the success of the initial programme run at the London Hampstead school, the programme was rolled out to include all US and Canadian schools and Cambridge offering both residential and non residential options to students. Some ESL schools, including LSI, have also rolled out Family programmes to cater for the recent demand in family language courses where both parents and children can study in age appropriate classes in the same location.

Features MotoGP 15 features 18 tracks, and the official riders from the 2014 and 2015 seasons of Moto3, Moto2 and MotoGP, and will also feature customizable bikes. The season starts with the night race in Losail, and also includes Jerez, Assen and Sepang, with a wind and wet weather system. Other features include tire wear, damage and mechanical failures. Per official entries, Paul Bird Motorsport retired from the championship, but Suzuki and Aprilia made an official return. One new feature is the ability for the player to create their own racing team, with choice of logo and livery. Starting off with a Mahindra MGP3O bike, the player must advance through the classes, and recruit sponsors. The game also has a mode which focuses on recreating events from the 2014 season, and in particular the rivalry between Jorge Lorenzo, Valentino Rossi and Marc M√°rquez, and the comebacks from riders such as Andrea Iannone. The PlayStation 4 version features an online league mode, where players battle for the best lap times. Current riders Marquez (foreground) and Rossi (background) are both included in the game The game includes a total of over 100 riders, each in their respective teams, making up the three current classes (e.g. the Ducati Desmosedici and Honda NSF250R), and one historic class (covering 1992-2001, e.g. the Cagiva GP500), with a total of around 25 bikes. Some riders need to be unlocked via the game's experience/level system. A further historic class is available to download (covering 2004-2006, e.g. the Kawasaki ZX-RR). After Releasing of DLC 4-Stroke Champions It is the first game under Milestone srl to feature the main Kawasaki ZX-RR Motorcycle. Pre-race introduction voice- overs are provided by Gavin Emmett. Yamaha's Wayne Rainey is one of the classic riders included in the game Downloadable content In June 2015, 20 riders from the 2004 season were made available. In September 2015, 24 riders from the 2015 Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup season were made available. In December 2015, the Aut√≥dromo do Estoril (last used in 2012) was released, and can be used in single and multi-player modes.https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-gb/games/addons/motogp15-season- pass/cid=EP4356-CUSA02041_00-MOTOGP15SEASON00 Reception The game had mixed reviews. The developer issued a warning that the Xbox One version contained a number of bugs.http://www.gamespot.com/articles/motogp-dev-warns-of-xbox-one- performance-issues/1100-6428442/ On the PlayStation 4, the consensus was that it looked ok, but did not improve significantly on the previous game. The Official PlayStation Magazine praised the bike handling, adding that \\"AI riders put up a great fight, outbraking you into hairpins and slipstreaming past you down the straights. ... overall, the racing is solid and challenging, and securing a podium finish without resorting to the rewind function is a significant achievement.\\" Analog Addiction praised the customisable race options and the stable and enjoyable multiplayer component. MotoGP 15 reached number 11 in the UK PS3 sales charts, as of April 19, 2016 still not available in North America and number 16 in the PS4 charts.

It ceased activities in 2010 due to financial problems.  History  Union Ginnastica Goriziana was founded in 1868, with the basketball section officially established in 1934. The team would reach the first division Serie A in 1952, staying there for two seasons. Goriziana played five Serie A seasons in the 1960s (1961‚Äì62, 1963‚Äì65, 1966‚Äì67, 1969‚Äì70) without gaining a foothold in the league. It yoyo-ed between the top tier and the second tier Serie A2 from 1975 to 1984, following which it stayed in the Serie A2 until 1998. A solitary season back in the Serie A would see the club escape relegation on the court only for the management to sell the sporting rights to Scavolini Pesaro and move down to the third division Serie B1. The team started again from the third division Serie B1 as Nuova Pallacanestro Gorizia. However, it continued struggling on and off the court and was in the Serie C dilettanti when it withdrew from the league in September 2010 due to the owner refusing to fund the club on his own. The club did not take part in another league and stopped functioning that year.

Proteins containing the domain are induced by many environmental stressors such as nutrient starvation, drought, extreme temperatures, high salinity, and the presence of uncouplers, antibiotics and metals. In the presence of these stressors, Usp genes are upregulated resulting in large quantities of Usp proteins being produced by the cell. The over production of USP genes allows the organisms to better cope with stresses by largely unknown mechanisms. However, the USPs will alter the expression of a variety of genes that help to cope with stress.. Function The protein structure of a Universal Stress Protein found in Haemophylus influenzae . The primary function of this superfamily is to protect the organism from environmental stress such as exposure to UV light, which may induce genes containing the USP domain in order to protect the DNA and more generally the cell from further damage. During bacterial starvation the USP genes upregulated will often arrest cell growth and promote its metabolism to adapt to sparse nutrients. Recent research also suggests proteins containing this domain have functions beyond the realms of dealing with environmental stresses.. Nachin et al. demonstrated in Escherichia coli that USPs are involved in actions such as adhesion and motility. The researchers, through means of \\"knocking out\\" USP genes known as UspE and UspC, saw results suggesting an inability to swim and completely lack of motility, respectively. Conversely, mutants for genes UspF and UspG were shown to have enhanced swimming abilities. Therefore, mobility is affected both positively and negatively USPs within E. coli. This demonstrates USPs influence throughout the cell could be widespread for a number of reasons. Additionally, in Halmonas elongate, there is a USP called TeaD has been described as a key regulator in the transport of Ectoine across the cell membrane.. This demonstrates how versatile USPs can be. Their function, while primarily encompasses increasing survival during stressful conditions, is not always limited to this. Evolution The ubiquitous nature of these proteins suggests the domain evolved in an ancestral species as well as highlighting the clear biological significance these proteins have in order to still be present the three domains of life. It has been suggested that the USP A domain was part of an ancient protein family. This is due to the similarity in structure between many distantly related organisms.. Aravind et al. confirmed these ideas with extensive evolutionary analysis. Aravind suggested that these proteins were part of a much larger protein structural family which was present and diversified in our last universal common ancestor for all extant life. The original function has been suggested to be a nucleotide binding domain which was implicated in signal transduction . Structure As the USP domain is widespread across many organisms, there is great diversity in the structures of these proteins. For Haemophilus influenzae, its UspA resides in the cytoplasm. The protein forms an asymmetric dimer with characteristic alpha and beta fold structures. There are differences among different bacteria in areas such as ATP binding sites. In this case, UspA does not have ATP binding activity. Generally, USPs form dimers and have domains for nucleotide binding activity. However, as it is such a diverse group, often with little known about the exact structure, it‚Äôs not possible to comment on each USP. In addition to this, UspA may reside in different areas of the cell. For example, in this case it was in the cytoplasm but for others, it may be in the cell membrane. Bacteria Much of the research into USP is done on bacteria, specifically E. coli (Strain K-12). Consequently, much is known about the USP domains in bacteria. In E. coli there are six families of USP domains which are present in more than 1000 different proteins. The six families are Usp A, -C, -D, -E, -F and ‚ÄìG which are triggered by differing environmental insults and often act via varying mechanisms. UspA is the most commonly studied USP due to its widespread presence within bacterial genomes. UspA is especially implicated in the resistance of a huge number of stressors most notably tetracycline exposure and high temperatures, with the exception of not forming a response to cold shock. It is thought UspA is especially important to the recovery of E. coli following starvation of nutrients. UspA during normal growth conditions does not seem to influence gene expression. However, during stressful conditions such as carbon starvation, UspA has been shown to have a global influence on gene expression. A proposed mechanism for such a change in gene expression is that UspA has been suggested to bind to DNA. When UspA is mutated, E. coli becomes far more vulnerable UV induced DNA damage. It‚Äôs important to note the USP responses are independent of many other stress responses seen in bacteria such as rpoS. This schematic shows a generalised bacterial response to an environmental stress. In this case, it depicts increased levels of Nitric Oxide which stimulates Usp gene transcription. This results in an anti-stress response from the cell which may or may not include the responses listed within the diagram. The induction of USP proteins have also been implicated in transitions not only in metabolism or growth but in changes in the colonies' entire phenotype. Bacterial colonies can produce formations known as biofilms. Zhang and colleagues demonstrated that USPs may be involved in the promotion of intertidal biofilms. They observed that during stressful conditions involving metal ions and oxidative stresses that the biofilm phenotype would form. Upon analysis of these biofilms, it could be seen that there was a greatly upregulated level of UspA which Zhang suggests, may be involved with induction of biofilm formation. It is thought UspA may be involved in signalling processes which will upregulate genes involved with biofilm production. With findings such as these, it's beginning to be accepted that USPs are acting using an extremely wide range of mechanisms to ensure cell survival. Regulation In bacteria, the USP genes can be regulated by sigma factors within RNA polymerases. This includes sigma factor œÉ70 which through binding to a single promoter region, upregulates the transcription of UspA in bacteria. The genes are regulated in a monocistronic fashion. Additionally, UspA, UspC, UspD and UspE are over induced during stationary phase through regulation of RecA. RecA is known for its involvement in the repair of DNA via homologous recombination following damage. Consequently, the four Usp domain genes are thought to be mediating the management or protection of DNA. Whatever the mechanism exhibited by the proteins, one thing which can be concluded is that USP domains are crucial for survival of many bacterial species. Gomes et al. found that UspA deletions in Listeria severely impaired survival as well as listeria‚Äôs stress response by in vitro and in vivo. USP domain genes are regulated by a number of proteins involved with growth, DNA repair and cell division. Notable positive regulation occurs via the action of ppGpp, RecA and FtsZ dependent regulatory pathways. USP domain genes are also under the negative control of FadR. Plants Plants contain many hundreds of USP domains and genes. These genes are notably induced by environmental stresses such as drought. When a lack of hydration occurs, biochemical changes induced by the actions of USPs ensue. In response to drought, there is a reduction in photosynthetic carbon production as well as a reduction in energy metabolism. These actions are suggested to occur due to their implications in increasing energy conservation. Water limiting conditions are a common environmental pressure which plants will need to cope with on a regular basis, depending on their habitat. These resistant phenotypes will have an increased survival as they allow the plant to conserve energy in times of restricted water which is key to glucose production through photosynthesis. Clinical significance Tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the infectious agent responsible for Tuberculosis (TB), persists within an estimated two billion people. TB is known for its ability to transition into a latent state whereby there is slow growth but high persistence within the mammalian host in structures known as granulomas. These granuloma structures are made up of various cellular materials and immune cells. These include macrophages, neutrophils, cellulose and fats. It has long been proposed that USPs play a significant role in the persistence of TB within the human host. This is due to observations of elevated Usp genes within M. tuberculosis in the latent granuloma stage of the infection. There are eight types of USPs within M. tuberculosis, all of which have an ATP binding domain. It has been found that within M. tuberculosis, these USPs are regulated by FtsK and FadR. One recent finding shows that the induction of USPs within M. tuberculosis results in USP binding activity with intracellular cAMP which has indirect implications on transcription within the bacteria. Some of M. tuberculosis' USPs are suggested to be induced by the hypoxic conditions found within the granuloma. Specifically, Rv2623, a type of USP in M. tuberculosis, is induced by the presence of nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species and a downshift in pH. All of these conditions are suggested to be produced by the actions of macrophages which are particularly prevalent within the granuloma structures that are characteristic of TB latent infections. These conditions have been found to upregulate a particular USP gene called rv2623, as well as an additional 50 genes involved in long term persistence in the mammalian host. It was suggested this USP gene was involved in inducing the latent response within the mammalian host. This stage of the infection is currently chronic with no effective treatments. This makes these kinds of findings extremely valuable. Rv2623 has an ATP binding domain which if knocked out results in a hyper- virulent form of the bacteria. Understanding these processes aids researchers in their quest to provide effective treatment for those suffering from TB. Rv2623 is also a key biomarker aiding the diagnostic process for TB. Therefore, these USP genes could be crucial for the long term survival of the bacteria meaning that there may be potential therapeutic avenues of research to explore in treating latent TB. This comes at a time whereby TB kills many thousands of people a day and is becoming increasing problematic to treat with the rise of multi-drug-resistant TB. Salmonella Similarly, USPs are crucial for the survival of Salmonella, the causative agent in Salmonellosis. In developing countries, food poisoning of this kind is a potentially life- threatening condition. The USPs have influence in growth arrest, stress responses and virulence. UspA is induced by metabolic, oxidative and temperature related stress. In these conditions UspA is over produced through the transcriptional regulation by ppGpp and RecA. These responses have been suggested to be involved in the protection of DNA. As a result, UspA aids Salmonella to resist stressors produced by the mammalian immune system assisting in survival and hence, pathogenicity. When UspA is inactivated in Salmonella, the mutants die prematurely, demonstrating how crucial these proteins are to survival and persistence. Again, understanding these processes may aid researchers in developing effective drugs to treat these infections.

J Clin Oncol, 2014. 32(25): p. 2780-7. Design The basis of Lungscape is a decentralized biobank with fully annotated tissue samples from resected stage I - III non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). An electronic database (termed iBiobank) is used to store the anonymized comprehensive molecular and clinical data and tracking biological material and derivatives thereof. Participating centers use a secure web-based application to enter data into this central database. The virtual nature of iBiobank and the introduction of stringent standardized biomolecular assessments, a so called external quality assurance (EQA) process to establish laboratory performance levels [5], remove the need of transferring samples to a central location for evaluation. The system captures detailed parameters like tumor stage, grade, histological subtype, precise surgical procedure as well as patient characteristics.

It describes the mode of cooperation of the participating investigators, the selection of documentation of the NSCLC cohort, laboratory requirements as well as the regulatory framework. Specific protocol modules (subprojects) then formulate a hypothesis to be investigated in the framework of Lungscape.

It describes a variety of methods, such as observations, student assessments, student work samples and examples of teacher work, that education leaders use to determine the effectiveness of a K-12 educator. The drive for educator effectiveness programs stem from Race to the top where states were awarded points for meeting educational policies based on the teacher's effectiveness. This policy was the basis of the emergence of statewide educator effectiveness programs. Educator effectiveness programs vary from state to state. Typically, an educator effectiveness program describes a cycle of observations and assessments that apply to different groups of teachers during an academic year. New teachers are evaluated more frequently, and veteran teachers are evaluated across multiple year cycles. Evaluated teachers have multiple scheduled classroom observations and conferences with the evaluator in addition to unannounced classroom observations. A controversial aspect of The purpose of evaluations is to help educators determine what is effective in their practices and provides them a medium to reflect upon and change their practice to help teachers become more effective.  Definition  Educator effectiveness is a method used in the K-12 school system that uses multiple measures of assessments including classroom observations, student work samples, assessment scores and teacher artifacts, to determine the impact a particular teacher has on student's learning outcomes. While schools have used teacher evaluation practices and policies for many years, the emergence of educator effectiveness policies combines these existing practices with rubrics and test scores to provide more robust perspectives on the work of teachers. Educator effectiveness initiatives often use descriptions of effective teaching practices, such as Charlotte Danielson's \\"Framework for Teaching\\", to organize teaching separate domains for assessment. Danielson's domains include: Planning and Preparation, Classroom Environment, Professional Responsibilities, and Instruction.  Purpose  Teacher evaluations have changed over time and have had different standards across the United States. Evaluation systems often have been comprised an administrator observing a teacher a couple times per year. In some locations, teacher observations were only done on a three-year or longer cycle. In the past, a Widget Effect, as described by The New Teacher Project has been established that has developed a culture where all teachers feel as though they deserve the highest marks on evaluations. Schools used to see their job as filling positions and thought that any teacher who was given a license was high quality, and thus scored them according to that thought process. Therefore, all teachers were getting scores that were good or great and no variation was able to be determined between any two teachers. Today, federal and state policies have encouraged school systems to design more comprehensive evaluation systems that rely on multiple measures of how a teacher performs by looking at items such as student performance gains, classroom observations, teacher reflections, content specific knowledge and student reflections. Some policy makers and researchers encourage the design of systems to identify and sort good and bad teachers; others are designed to provide meaningful feedback and professional development to teachers in order to enhance their skills. Overall, the purpose of educator effectiveness is to build the capacity for teachers to enhance their skills. The effective teachers have an effect on student's ability to have a higher level of conceptual understanding of a topic and have displayed the ability to think more abstractly than peers taught by less effective teachers. Quality teaching also has been identified as a key influence for positive learning outcomes for the diverse body of students in the classroom.  How it is being used  As of 2013, US schools United States had very little cohesiveness in their teacher effectiveness requirements and implementations. In 2013, 25 states required that student achievement is a big or the biggest part of teacher evaluations. Twenty-seven states required teacher evaluations be based on a variety of student assessments and work samples and 44 states required classroom observations to be put into teacher evaluations. Overall, 11 states require a statewide teacher evaluation system; 10 states gave a statewide evaluation model that districts can either do or decide to do a similar model. To date only a small handful of states have adopted policies connecting the performance of students to their teachers and the colleges where the teachers were trained.Doherty, K.M & Jacobs, S. (2013). State of the States 2013: Connect the Dots ‚Äì Using evaluations of teacher effectiveness to inform policy and practice. Washington, D.C. The National Council on Teacher Quality. Many countries have national policies that decide what teacher evaluation systems that schools will have to follow. Some countries such as Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden provide annual feedback on teaching practices. Other countries, such as Norway and Iceland leave the decision about how the teacher evaluations systems will be done to be determined at a local level. The quality of teaching in these countries is compared to the curriculum they follow and with the school instructional plan. Finland does not use any standardized testing as a measure of teacher effectiveness. Singapore is another country that does not use test scores but rather focuses on how teachers work together as a main part of their evaluation system. Singapore also focuses heavily on professional development around evaluation, coaching, mentoring and collaborating with other educators with an overall goal of getting a high quality teaching staff.Walker, T. (2013, March 25). How Do High-Performing Nations Evaluate Teachers? - NEA Today. Retrieved April 22, 2015, from http://neatoday.org/2013/03/25/how-do-high-performing-nations- evaluate-teachers/ There is significant debate in the U.S. about how to reward teachers for performance as measured by educator effectiveness policies. Some schools rewards teachers by paying them more based upon their student's test scores, which is linked to the Race to the Top funding in the United States.Rosales, J. (2004). Pay based on test scores? What educators need to know about linking teacher pay to student achievement. National Education Association. However, other reward systems are being created based on the idea that improving a teacher's capacity to learn and improve upon their practice will have a direct impact on student achievement. These schools increase pay for teachers who have a National Board Certification using National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, advanced degrees, engaging in professional development, mentor new colleagues and paying more for these qualified teachers in hard to staff schools Flannery, M.E. & Jehlen, A. (2008). Where is your pay plan heading? National Education Foundation The connection of teacher effectiveness and merit pay varies in different countries. In Finland and Canada, they do not to use merit-pay approaches but encourage conversations between the evaluator and teacher about student progress and success. In contrast, Chinese and Singaporean teachers, get financial bonuses and promotions for high performance. High-performing countries have a strong system of professional and school-level accountability but look at success on things such as school improvement goals, professional contributions, and indicators of student well-being.Stewart, V. (2010). Raising Teacher Quality Around the World. Educational Leadership, 68(4), 16-20.  Methods of evaluating teachers  Most educator effectiveness programs rely two kinds of data: observations of teaching practices and student outcomes data. There are four main sources of observational data collected by schools: # Classroom observations happen when someone comes into a teacher's classroom to observe their teaching practice, typically done by a school administrator. The methods of commenting on teaching practice within classroom observations varies from district created to purchased evaluation forms.Goe, L. & Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality. # Some schools use Self- Evaluation as a reflective tool for teachers to look at their current practice and change what they are doing to have a greater educational impact on students. Teachers often use a variety of tools to reflect and change their practice including self-monitoring, recording their own practice, and student's feedback through survey's and questionnaires.Schwartz, M. (2015). Self-Evaluation of Teaching. Ryerson University: The Learning and Teaching Office. # Teacher Portfolios are used to compile a variety of evidence of teacher practices for the purpose of showing development of teaching over time. It is often used in conjunction with self-reflection or peer-reviewing of teaching practices.Center for Teaching. (2015) Teaching Portfolios from http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/teaching-portfolios/ # Peer-Review of Teaching is a method for teaching to discuss their practice with another teacher or group of teachers that gives feedback about teaching and learning. Often an evaluation of the teaching materials is done with the purpose of providing feedback to change teaching practices.Center for Teaching and Learning (2015). Peer Review of Teaching. University of Minnesota from http://www1.umn.edu/ohr/teachlearn/resources/peer/ The new part of educator effectiveness policies is the integration of outcome data into the evaluation process. The biggest component of the outcome data is growth of student learning as measured by standardized tests. Most educator effectiveness programs rely on some form of value-added measures to determine student growth. Value-added measure use longitudinal measures of student achievement to estimate the growth in student learning that can be attributed to individual teachers. If the students of a specific teacher demonstrate growth in learning better than predicated on standardized tests, the teacher is said to be effective; if the students score below the predicted scores, the teacher is said to be ineffective.Goe, L. & Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality. Parent and student surveys are another method of collecting data on teachers and their educational practices.Teaching and Learning Center (2015). General Education Improvement. University of the Science from http://www.usciences.edu/teaching/tips/improvement.shtml  Criticisms  Many argue that it is difficult to measure the effect that teachers have on student learning. Many teachers who are in the K-12 system, teach subjects that are not assessed on state mandated testing. In order to effectively implement an educator effectiveness system, some argue that states need to create different evaluation systems for the teachers who teach students in non-tested areas such as submitted portfolios of student work, lesson logs, video clips of them teaching and reflective commentaries on lessons.Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education. Others argue about the methodology as some districts are using value added models to determine the effectiveness to teachers. They state that it is an unreliable measurement tool because the makeup of classes differ greatly from teacher to teacher and from year to year. Some say that it ends up penalizing teachers who traditionally do not score well on standardized assessments such as students who receive free and reduce lunch and students with disabilities. They state that this may cause the highly effective teachers to work at schools with a low disability rate and a middle to high socioeconomic status.Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education. There are different ways to calculate the value-added effect of teachers that changes depending on how they define value-added and what they use to calculate it. It typically does not account for the expectations put on students who go into a classroom reading below grade level and are expected to have a much higher growth rate than their peers. Through many research studies, it has shown that the estimates of teacher effectiveness were not through the same throughout different years or content areas such as reading and math and may be difficult to compare gains from tests from year to year when they don't measure the same content David, J.L ( 2010). What research says about using value-added measures to evaluate teachers. Educational Leadership (67)8 Some have commented that evaluators in states with teacher evaluation systems do not have through enough training. Furthermore, these evaluators often do not have to prove themselves as effective teachers themselves. As of 2013, only 13 states require a certification for their evaluators that require evaluators are effective teachers. Furthermore, often the same evaluator is observing students every time. In order to have high quality teacher feedback, some would argue that multiple perspectives by highly effective educators would create the dialogue and feedback that would help teachers to grow.Doherty, K.M & Jacobs, S.

Biography Information is lacking concerning Bevignani's place of birth and her early years. She was apparently born in 1887 and studied singing with a certain teacher Perilli. She made her debut in 1909 at Politeama Garibaldi in Treviso as Micaela in Bizet's Carmen. Subsequently, she was invited to many Italian provincial stages, such as the Teatro Petruzzelli in Bari and the Teatro Massimo Bellini in Catania. In 1910 she made several guest appearances in a number of opera houses of Latin America, including the Theatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro,\\"Echoes of Music Abroad,\\" Musical America (May 21, 1910), p. 11. where she sang Musetta in Puccini's La boh√®me and Gilda in Rigoletto. In 1911 she performed the role of Marguerite de Valois in Giacomo Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots at the Teatro Donizetti in Bergamo under the direction of Gino Marinuzzi.\\"Bevignani, Margherita,\\" Grosses S√§ngerlexikon, Vierte, erweiterte und aktualisierte Auflage, (M√ºnchen: K.G. Sauer, 2003), Band 1, p. 398. In 1912 Bevignani arrived in Milan, where she sang Amina in Bellini's La sonnambula at the Teatro dal Verme, though never appeared at La Scala. In the same year she toured London, where, despite never managing to sing at The Royal Opera House, she performed Nedda in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci at the Coliseum Theatre.La Voce Antica. In 1914-1916 Bevignani was invited to the Netherlands, where she was particularly praised for her Violetta in La traviata as well as Norina in Gaetano Donizetti's Don Pasquale. Italy's entrance into the First World War forced the singer's stay in the Netherlands, where she gave successful performances as Violetta, Gilda, Rosina in Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia and Lucia di Lammermoor in Donizetti's opera of the same title. After returning to Italy in 1918, Bevignani was struck by a fierce attack of pulmonary tuberculosis which put an end to her career. Her last performance was La traviata at the Royal Theatre Carr√© in Amsterdam where she sang Violetta. Margherita Bevignani died in Milan in March 1921, being only 34 years old. Discography Even though Margherita Bevignani did not achieve any worldwide recognition and virtually never managed to sing at any of the world's principal opera houses, the name of this singer is significant. She sang Violetta in the first complete Italian recording of La traviata in 1915 with Franco Tumminello and Ernesto Badini as partners, made by HMV in Milan with the forces of La Scala under the direction of Carlo Sabajno. It shows Bevignani as a coloratura soprano. In addition, Bevignani can be heard on a number of separate recordings made for the Favorite company, including extended excerpts from Gounod's Faust, arias and duets by Verdi, Bellini, Donizetti, Rossini, Wagner and Massenet.

Childhood  Bo≈æo Vreƒáo, a Bosnian Serb, was born in Foƒça, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia on October 18, 1983. His father died when he was five years old, and he grew up with his mother and two sisters. His mother was an artist and encouraged Vreƒáo to paint and draw, as well as to learn music. He taught himself how to read and write music, as well as sing, from the Internet. As an effeminate boy, Vreƒáo experienced many struggles growing up in his provincial home town, and was frequently bullied.  Professional career Vreƒáo went to Belgrade, Serbia to earn his Masters in Archeology, but realized that his true passion was sevdalinka. At age 27, he began learning how to sing from traditional recordings. He then traveled to Sarajevo. A local musician discovered Vreƒáo singing in a cafe and invited him to perform in the band Halka, with whom he recorded his first CD. Prior to his musical career, Vreƒáo worked as an archaeology professor. He began performing professionally with the band Halka in 2013, and gained fame within and away from the Balkans at sold out concerts and international music festivals. Vreƒáo performed as the lead singer for Halka, recording two albums with them in 2013 and 2015, which resulted in a world tour In 2014, in between recording two albums with Halka, Vreƒáo recorded his first solo album, Moj Sevdah, where he performed seventeen sevdalinkas in a cappella style, including two original songs. By 2015, Vreƒáo became known and written about in the English-speaking world. In 2017, Vreƒáo recorded his second solo album, Pandora, which included performances with Marko Louis, Indigo, Velahavie, and Merima Kljuƒço. Two songs from the album Moj Sevdah will be part of Ko≈°tana, a play directed by Kokan Mladenoviƒá. Vreƒáo had a leading role in the play. The Swedish national television station will produce a documentary about Vreƒáo, his life, and his devotion to sevdalinka. In addition to sevdalinka, Vreƒáo enjoys jazz, blues and soul, and tries to bring their elements into his interpretation of sevdalinka. He is inspired by the musical artists Himzo Polovina, Selim Salihoviƒá, Emina Zeƒçaj, and Nada Mamula. Vreƒáo performs as both female and male, as he sees himself as a person of both genders. At the beginning of his career, Vreƒáo wore men's suits, then decided to perform as what he considers his true self. It is his belief that a person who sings songs of courage should present nothing but honesty to their audience, which is one reason why more traditional audiences love him. He takes offense at those who consider him a drag performer. As a reviver of a traditional women's genre, Vreƒáo defends the place of women in Bosnian society by singing their songs. He wears his hair long, with kohl around his eyes, and dresses in kaftans, dresses, or floating coats as he spins and sings on stage. At the same time, he is a bearded man. His performances are continually sold out in a patriarchal Balkan society, and his fans cross gender and ethnic boundaries. Vreƒáo hopes that, through his musical performances, he can also be a voice for LGBT rights in the Balkans.  Personal life  In some interviews, Vreƒáo has identified as gay, but he consistently states that he is both female and male and that he is a free person who will not hide his true self. When he is not performing, Vreƒáo writes, paints, and enjoys traveling for pleasure. While he still lives in Sarajevo, he tries to go home to Foƒça as frequently as possible to visit his family.

Early career  Having previously spent time working in the kitchen of the Manchester Roadhouse making food for touring bands who played at the venue it was at the Roadhouse that McTague decided she wanted to cook for a living. She wrote to a number of restaurants and received responses from Heston Blumenthal, who wanted her to get some experience, and the Michelin starred Sharrow Bay Country House in Ullswater in the Lake District, which gave her a job cleaning rooms until an opportunity in the kitchens arose. Starting off as a Commis Chef and working her way up to Chef de Partie, it was at Sharrow Bay that McTague became the hotel‚Äôs first female chef and where she also met her husband, chef Laurence Tottingham. Following their time at Sharrow Bay, McTague and Tottingham went to America, working for a period in the Big Cedar Lodge in Missouri. On returning to England McTague wrote again to Heston Blumenthal at The Fat Duck and was given a role compiling historical research and developing dishes for Blumenthal's pub The Hind's Head. McTague remained there for four years before opening her own restaurant Aumbry in Prestwich, Greater Manchester with Tottingham in 2009.  Aumbry  Despite being set in an intimately small location Aumbry quickly became a much loved and critically acclaimed restaurant with Simon Hattenstone describing it in The Guardian as a \\"miracle of Lilliputian industry.\\" and The Telegraph's Zoe Williams declaring that \\"From a fancy cheese puff to a potty-yet-perfect pudding, the menu at Aumbry blew my mind.\\" In the autumn of 2014 Aumbry closed for refurbishment and a temporary pop up restaurant called 4244 was set up in Manchester‚Äôs Northern Quarter. 4244's run was initially planned for only a few weeks but was quickly extended until the end of the year and in January 2015 McTague ended speculation about the future of Aumbry by confirming that it would not reopen. Later that month McTague announced that she would be working in collaboration with Prestwich bar Cuckoo to run a three-month residency in the venue, offering bistro food with a focus on locally sourced produce.  Post Aumbry  In March 2015 McTague‚Äôs business partner and co- owner of the Manchester Roadhouse Kate Mountain, announced that she had decided to close the Roadhouse after it had been a music venue for 22 years. Days later a further announcement revealed that McTague and Mountain would be turning the site into a new city centre restaurant. Media work McTague has appeared on two series of the BBC series Great British Menu, in 2013 and 2014. She is also regularly interviewed on BBC television and radio and has written a food column for The Guardian newspaper. Awards McTague and her restaurants have won a number of awards. In 2012 Aumbry won Restaurant of the Year at the Manchester Food and Drink Awards and the following year she was named Chef of the Year. In 2014 McTague won the Cheshire Life and Lancashire Life Chef of the Year. Collaborations Through her culinary work McTague has taken part in a range of creative collaborations. In 2012 Aumbry worked with Prestwich Book Festival to create a menu based on food featured in author Emma Jane Unsworth's book Hungry, The Stars and Everything. A one off menu was created and Unsworth read extracts of her book to diners at points throughout the meal. The following year the restaurant devised another menu for the book festival, this time based on Sybille Bedford's work A Legacy with readings provided by actress Julie Hesmondhalgh. In 2015 the Manchester International Festival commissioned McTague to create a magical food event to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the publication of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, with tickets selling out in minutes. Participants were given a behind-the-scenes visit of Manchester Museum with culinary adventures in each room.

Background Cullen's poetry derives from his mixed South American and British heritage. He spent long periods immersed in rave culture, particularly Oldschool jungle. When he lived in Bristol he would MC to Drum and bass and Reggae, and become friends with Roni Size labelmate MC Tali. He would frequently return to Argentina, on trips to document Cumbia Villera and other subgenres. Poetry Cullen's first collection of poetry, Wave Caps, was a The Times Literary Supplement ‚ÄòBook of the Year‚Äô in 2014.

It is a non-profit debate initiative based in Tunis, Tunisia and Washington, D.C. aimed at creating a debating forum in which youth, women, and marginalized communities in the Arabic speaking sphere can participate. History Benkredda founded the Munathara Initiative's predecessor, Dubai Debates, in 2011 intending for it to be an independent platform for discussing important issues facing the Arab world. The project was funded by groups such as KAS (Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung) and Vital Voices. In early 2012, he suspended Dubai Debates and created a sister organization, the Munathar Initiative, in Tunis, Tunisia. Format and functionality Participants submit a 99-second video or less onto Munathara's online platform expressing their views on current issues, and the public is able to watch all of the contributions and vote on their favorite ones. The top 8 participants, who gather the most popular videos, travel to one of the countries Munathara operates in to participate in a three-day intense training and the chance to debate the issues face to face with Arab opinion leaders in televised debates. The Munathara Initiative also organizes debate and communication skill training sessions for the youth, and is currently working in Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Jordan, Egypt and Yemen while also operating a debate program for Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. The initiative organizes workshops, online debate competitions and live TV debates so that young people are able to engage in debates about current issues in their communities and be part of the new Arab public sphere. EED (European Endowment for Democracy), AA (Federal Foreign Office of Germany), and National Endowment for Democracy (NED) are supporting outreach activities. Debates Freedom of expression in the new Arab world Alongside two Arab opinion leaders, Mona Eltahawy and Riyad Al-Chaibi, two youth participants, Esraa Al Shaikh from Jordan and Ichrak Mtar from Tunisia, debated a range of related questions that are rarely discussed publicly in the Arab world, including religion, blasphemy and nudity. The debate was broadcast in full by Tunisna TV. Is Tunisia on the right path? This debate featured Ajmi Lourimi, Vice President of the Ennahda Movement, and opposition politician Yassine Brahim, Secretary-General of the Republican Party. They were joined by two Musbaqat Munathara winners Oumayma Theiri and Nasser Benzine. The debate centered on Tunisia's Constituent Assembly, whose 2012 deadline to conclude its work had just passed. Debate focussed on whether the ruling Ennahda party, back in 2012, had taken Tunisia on the right path. Is Arab Political Unity our Destiny? Ghida Al Quda from Jordan and Yassine Ben Smida from Tunisia were chosen by public vote to take part in the live televised debate, and were joined by Palestinian commentator Abdel Bari Atwan, then editor-in-chief of Al-Quds Al- Arabi newspaper, and Bashar Haydar, a Lebanese philosophy professor at the American University in Beirut. The panel's focus was to debate issues regarding the long-term vision for the region. Should Tunisia Separate Religion and the State? Bachir Ben Hassan, a prominent Salafist, argued against the separation of religion in the new Tunisian republic, while Youssef Seddik, a Tunisian philosopher and scholar of the Islamic faith, presented his secular vision for Tunisia. They were joined by Ahmed Ben Hassine and Mayssa Lajmi. Is Foreign Military Intervention the only Option Left in Syria? Arguing against military intervention were Mostafa Alsaied, a Syrian journalist, and Rana Yousef. Also opposing the motion were Iman Shaker, a veteran Syrian feminist and writer, and Yara Khalil, the other winner of the Munathara Initiative's online debate competition. The debate centered on three topics: First, can foreign military intervention be justified based on the use of chemical weapons? Second, if military intervention were to occur, should regime change be its goal? Finally, what impact would foreign military intervention have on the region? Is Tunisia Facing Bankruptcy? A televised debate was planned for 9 October 2013, featuring two young winners of the Munathara Initiative's tenth debate cycle, debating alongside the former transitional Minister of Finance, Slim Besbes and the economist Mahmoud Ben Romdhane of Nidaa Tounes, the current ruling party in Tunisia. The debate was structured around three specific topics: Is economic instability a result of political instability in Tunisia? Has the Tunisian government done enough to make the country attractive for much-needed foreign investment? How is the government stimulating the creation of jobs? Arab Women's Participation: Only through Quotas? Marwan Ismail from Yemen and Mustafa Abdellatif from Egypt, the two winners of the Musabaqa, debated alongside long-time Yemeni activist and President of the Arab Sisters Forum for Human Rights Amal Basha and the Tunisian activist and defender of freedom of expression Yassine Ayari. The debate, which is the first installment of Munathara's Policy Debates series, was centered on whether women's participation in the region can only be ensured through quotas. Topics addressed ideal percentages for women's quotas, the impact of quotas on political representation, and the social changes that would have to take place in order for women to be true partners in political, social, and economic decision-making. #ThereWon'tBeChangeUnless With a new format, and following The Munathara Initiative's model, #DDX solicited contributions from Arab youth throughout the region to upload 99-second videos giving their perspectives on a pressing issue in their communities, using any type of artistic expression, such as speech, music, rap, dance, poetry, or any other form they think best represents their ideas. Online voting determined the top eight participants who travelled to Amman, Jordan to participate in the 3-day forum, alongside twelve of Munathara‚Äôs past debate winners, and five curated up-and-coming Arab youth. On the second day of the conference, a panel of judges selected the six winners (out of the 25 youth participants) who would participate in the live televised show on the third day of the forum, alongside Arab celebrities and thought-leaders, and become Munathara's Fellows.

Born in New York City on March 13, 1864, Walker would have a career in theater prior to entering the film industry. By 1915 he was appearing in Broadway productions, his first being Sinners, written by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, Owen Davis. His film debut was in a leading role in 1917's American ‚Äì That's All. He had a lengthy career, in both film and on stage, appearing in numerous plays and over 80 films. Walker died on December 4, 1947 in Honolulu, Hawaii. Career Walker had a long career in theater, eventually rising to appear in Broadway productions, beginning with 1915's Sinners, which was written by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, Owen Davis. The play was directed by William A. Brady, and also starred his daughter, Alice Brady, as well as Tony Award-winning actor John Cromwell From 1915 through 1930 he would appear over a dozen times on the Great White Way, with some of his more notable plays being An American Tragedy, taken from the best-selling novel of the same name by Theodore Dreiser, and Holiday, produced and directed by Arthur Hopkins. During the late 1910s, and through the 1920s, Walker would combine his stage career with appearances in several films, having mostly starring or featured roles over half a dozen. His debut film performance would be in the film American ‚Äì That's All (1917), in which he starred alongside Jack Devereaux and Winifred Allen. He appeared in his last Broadway production in 1930, with a featured role in Rebound, written by Academy Award winner, Donald Ogden Stewart. In 1931, Walker would devote his acting energies to the big screen, appearing in over 75 films throughout the rest of the decade. In one of his first films during this decade, he would reprise his role of Henry Jaffrey in the film version of Rebound, which starred Ina Claire, Robert Ames and Myrna Loy. Walker appeared in over 40 feature films during his career, mostly in supporting or smaller roles. Some of the more notable films in which he had either a featured or supporting role included 1933's Flying Down to Rio, starring Dolores del R√≠o, and which featured the first on-screen pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; the original version of Imitation of Life in 1934, starring Claudette Colbert and Warren William; 1935's version of Magnificent Obsession, starring Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor (in which Walker had a small role); the Mae West vehicle Go West, Young Man in 1936, and as Benjamin Franklin in the 1938 film, Marie Antoinette, starring Norma Shearer and Tyrone Power. He would reprise the role of Franklin for the 1938 short, The Declaration of Independence. Walker's final screen appearance in a feature film was in a supporting role in The Cowboy and the Lady, starring Gary Cooper and Merle Oberon in 1938. Walker died on December 4, 1947 while visiting his daughter and her husband in Hawaii.

Despite their name, they are not structurally similar to antibodies, which makes them a type of antibody mimetic. Alphabodies are different from many other antibody mimetics in their ability to reach and bind to intracellular protein targets. Their single chain alpha-helical structure is designed by computer modelling, inspired by naturally existing coiled-coil protein structures. Alphabodies are being developed by the Belgian biotechnology company Complix N.V. as potential new pharmaceutical drugs against cancer and autoimmune disease. In 2012, a collaboration agreement was signed with Monsanto to develop the technology for agricultural applications as well. PDB 4OG9) Development Alphabodies are developed as scaffolds with a set of amino acid residues that can be modified to bind protein targets, while maintaining correct folding and thermostability. The Alphabody scaffold is computationally designed based on coiled-coil structures, but it has no known counterpart in nature. Initially, the scaffold was made of three peptides that associated non-covalently to form a parallel coiled-coil trimer. However, the scaffold was later redesigned as a single peptide chain containing three Œ±-helices connected by linker regions. The new structure allows for concentration-independent assembly and cost- effective scaling in bacterial expression systems. The three Œ±-helices (A, B, and C) were designed to remain stable even when some residues are modified. Residues in the groove between helices A and C can be modified to bind convex targets, while residues on the outside of helix C can be modified to bind concave protein targets. There are currently 3 libraries containing 1.0 to 1.7 √ó 108 variations each that can be screened using phage display for target affinity. Structure Alphabody denaturation data comparing truncated Alphabody stability to reference scaffold Standard The standard Alphabody scaffold contains three Œ±-helices, composed of four heptad repeats (stretches of 7 residues) each, connected via glycine/serine-rich linkers. The standard heptad sequence is \\"IAAIQKQ\\". Alanines are associated with Œ±-helix formation, while isoleucines are known to induce coiled-coil formation. Specific residues on the A and C helices can be modified to bind targets, but only variants that retain thermostability are used for further research. Specifically, the reference scaffold structure is N‚ÄìHRS1‚ÄìL1‚ÄìHRS2‚ÄìL2‚ÄìHRS3‚ÄìC. HRS = IEEIQKQIAAIQKQIAAIQKQIYRM; L = TGGSGGGSGGGSGGGSGMS The linker length is long enough to allow helices to fold in parallel or anti-parallel conformations, but experiments suggest only anti-parallel folding occurs. Truncated version An Alphabody scaffold variant with shorter linkers can be produced without the loss of thermostability. However, decreasing the number of heptad repeats per Œ±-helix reduces the thermostability of the Alphabody by around 40 ¬∞C. Properties Alphabody denaturation data from circular dichroism experiments Alphabodies have low molecular weight (~10 kDa) and very high thermostability (Tm = ~120 ¬∞C). Moreover, circular dichroism experiments suggest that Alphabodies can refold correctly after being denatured. These properties allow Alphabody-based drugs to be administered in ways other than injection. They also make the molecule stable enough to allow modification of residues on the scaffold itself ‚Äì rather than only loop regions ‚Äì increasing the possible variations and target selectivity. Alphabodies' high binding affinity and ability to target both extracellular and intracellular proteins allows them to be used to reach difficult targets that cannot be treated by therapeutic antibodies or small molecule drugs. Targets 3D structure of Alphabody in complex with IL-23 p19 subunit Autoimmune disease Alphabody CMPX-1023 has been successfully developed to target the p19 subunit of Interleukin 23 (IL-23) and has entered preclinical trials as of October 2011. In brief, IL-23 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in autoimmune inflammatory diseases like psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. There are anti-IL-23 drugs available, which work by targeting the p40 subunit. However, the p40 subunit is also present in Interleukin 12 (IL-12) and causes serious side- effects when antagonized, such as increased susceptibility to infection. Complix N.V. used phage display to create Alphabodies that could bind IL-23, and then employed several affinity maturation strategies to increase affinity to sub-nanomolar levels. They determined increased affinity resulted in increased functional inhibition of IL-23 and thus selected top 20 strongest binding Alphabodies as drug candidates. Mouse studies and X-ray crystallography studies on IL-23 in complex with the Alphabody confirmed specific binding to p19 only. Cancer Using a similar drug development strategy, Complix N.V. is developing Alphabodies capable of binding intracellular targets in cancer cells that can induce apoptosis. According to a 2012 article, Complix has had a degree of success in doing so: \\"These results show that Alphabodies can be designed to efficiently enter human cells and bind to targets of interest, allowing them to modulate intracellular protein-to-protein interactions and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Complix expects to report further break-through data from this important program over the course of 2012.\\" Funding The research on IL-23-specific Alphabodies was supported by grants from IWT-O&O;, Ghent University, and the Hercules foundation (Belgium). Complix N.V. is funded by equity shareholders Baekeland Fund, Biotech Fund Flanders, CRP-Sant√©, Edmond de Rothschild Investment Partners, Gemma Frisius Fund, Gimv, LRM, OMNES Capital, TrustCapital, Vesalius Biocapital, and Vinnof.

In 1927, Briggs was offered a position teaching economics at the University of Michigan's College of Literature, Science, and the Arts while also studying in the School of Business Administration, where he eventually graduated from with a Masters of Business Administration in 1928. From 1927 to 1935, Briggs was an instructor of economics at the University of Michigan's College of the Literature, Science, and the Arts. In 1933, Briggs became a certified public accountant in Michigan. In 1935, Briggs returned to the University of Michigan as an assistant professor of economics and accounting, which he taught until 1940 before being promoted to associate professor of economics and accounting at the School of Business Administration, a position he held until 1945. Intermittently, from 1934 to 1938, he was also the fraternity financial advisor within the university. During World War II, Briggs was on leave from the University of Michigan as assistant to the president of Standard Steel Spring Company, which made essential war material.1964\\\\.

Vice president of the University of Michigan In 1945, Briggs was named vice-president of business and finance at the University of Michigan, which put him in charge of purchasing, finance, collections, and investments.\\"Briggs Deserves Great Credit For Services Rendered.\\" Editorial. Ann Arbor News n.d.: 4. Print. Box 1, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. At the same time, the university was facing a significant problem: increasing enrollment because of soldiers returning from World War II who were interested in higher education. Briggs was tasked with expanding the facilities of the university in order to handle the increase in enrollment. He played an important role in securing married student housing at the nearby Willow Run Airport. University administrators did not believe that the university was prepared for the amount of food that would be brought in for the dorms, so Briggs worked to raise funds for the eventual food service building. Briggs was also critical in financing the building of key University of Michigan facilities such as Alice Lloyd Hall, South Quadrangle, the School of Business Administration, and the Administration Building, as well as acquiring land that would become the University of Michigan's North Campus. He reviewed different available land options the university could purchase, and settled on the site of what is now North Campus. Many within the university thought present-day North Campus was too far to be a part of the University, however Briggs argued that it was the best location because it would allow for the most expansion, and with this expansion came the realization that the physical and architectural face of the university was changing. Briggs said, \\"Each architect wants to leave his monument. And each one has got his own ideas. And which do you do? Do you let them have some fun and give the benefit of their best judgement, or do you straight lace them and tell them to do it your way. And we didn't do it that way.\\" Vice president of Consumer Power Company In 1951, Briggs resigned from his position as vice-president of business and finance at the University of Michigan in order to become the financial vice-president of nearby Consumer Power Company in Jackson, Michigan. Before he left Michigan, Briggs was thought to be a possible replacement for the retiring University of Michigan President Ruthven as he had a very successful tenure as an educator and administrator at the University of Michigan.. \\"Alumni Board Chooses Robert Briggs, MBA '28, to Receive Achievement Award.\\" Dividend n.d.: 32. Box 1, Robert Peter Briggs, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. Upon Briggs' resignation, the Ann Arbor News wrote, \\"When he leaves to go to his new post, he leaves the University as a bigger and better place for his foresight and provision in fields once foreign to learning.\\" Briggs became financial vice-president of Consumer Power Company in 1951. In 1952, Briggs was made executive vice- president and a member of the company's board of directors. At the Consumer Power Company, Briggs was tasked with running the company's financing, insurance, pensions, and other corporate activities.Consumers Power Company, Exact Source Unknown, Box 1, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. He retired on May 1, 1968, because of a company policy of retiring at the age of 65. However, he would stay on the board of directors until 1968. Other professional positions In 1959, Briggs became founding president of Michigan State Chamber of Commerce. The Michigan Chamber of Commerce promotes conditions that are favorable to business growth within the State of Michigan. While president, Briggs argued in the Detroit Free Press that, \\"Reduced taxes on business will improve our competitive position and stimulate the flow of risk capital back into Michigan.\\"Mudge, James. \\"Chamber Chief Offers Cure for Economic Ills.\\" Detroit Free Press 22 Sept. 1960: 13. Print. Box 1, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. On October 1, 1956, Briggs was added to the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Briggs would be a member of the board of directors until he was nominated as a candidate for election to the Michigan State Board of Education in 1958.Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Exact Source Unknown, Box 1, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. Briggs would go on to lose the election for the state board of education. Board of regents of the University of Michigan In 1964, University of Michigan Regent William McInally died, giving Michigan Governor George Romney the rare opportunity to nominate a regent. Governor Romney selected Briggs to fill the seat on the University of Michigan's Board of Regents. Romney said, \\"Bob Briggs is exceptionally well qualified for this important post and I am sure that by virtue of his long and faithful association with The University of Michigan, he will contribute significantly to the future growth of this fine institution.\\"Robert Peter Briggs File, Exact Source Unknown, Box 1, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. Briggs very much wanted to join the board of regents, saying later in an interview, \\"I definitely wanted (seat on Board of Regents) ... It was a great responsibility, because you were setting the framework with a pattern that was going to be followed. And the issues that came to the Board of Regents were pretty fundamental.\\" In 1968, while a member of the board of regents for the University, Briggs was also chairman of a committee that selected the replacement for retiring President Hatcher. The committee would select then University of Wisconsin provost Robben Wright Fleming to be the next President of the University of Michigan, a position he would hold until 1979. Briggs was criticized by some in the media when he refused to announce President Fleming's salary when Fleming was hired, saying, \\"Salaries at the U. of M. have never been a matter of public record.\\"University of Michigan Committee to Select President of University of Michigan (2), Exact Source Unknown, Box 1, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. Briggs was a member of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan during a time when there was much political unrest in the university community, especially amongst the students. He would later say, \\"Our first reaction, of course, was we don't want that around here. But it wasn't were long before you realized that this was something that was with us, and we had to find a way to work with the students and gradually it was recognized as something you had to face up to.\\" In 1968, Governor Romney asked Briggs to leave the University of Michigan Board of Regents in order to become the Commissioner of Michigan Financial Institutions, a role he honored until 1973, when he became a consultant for the Bureau of Department of Commerce for the state. President of University of Michigan Alumni Association Briggs was recruited by the alumni of the University of Michigan to become president of the Alumni Association in 1979. His long history with the school and expansion of the school while vice president were the main factors in his recruitment. The alumni association was in need of a new building on campus, and they wanted Briggs to spearhead the project given his prior experience in expanding the school. Awards Briggs received numerous awards and honors throughout his life. In 1962, he was awarded the Wolverine Frontiersman Award by the State of Michigan, \\"in recognition of his contributions to the advancement of Michigan.\\"Robert P. Briggs, Executive Vice President, Consumers Power Company. 4 Jan. 1966. Biographical Data. Box 1, Robert Peter Briggs, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. In 1992, Briggs was awarded the Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Michigan's School of Business Administration's Alumni Society Board of Governors. They said, \\"Through a long and successful life, (Briggs) has always used his talents to guide himself and others toward the highest standards of citizenship and service and achievement in both the public and private realms of his life.\\" In 1969, Briggs was awarded an honorary Doctor Of Law from the board of regents of the University of Michigan. Vision for education Briggs' strong vision for public education in America and for the University of Michigan prompted him to say, \\"But part of it is other things in the minds of the public becoming a lot more important than higher education. And to my mind, higher education is the most important responsibility that the University has\\" in reference to the importance of higher education. Briggs also accurately predicted that with the decrease of the size of the auto industry within the State of Michigan, the university would see a cut in the size of its state funding and thus would have to rely more heavily on private funds. Personal life and death Briggs married Maxine Eloise Corliss December 22, 1925, in Lansing, Michigan. Together they had two children: Ruth and Peter. Briggs died on September 2, 1998, at the age of 95, at his home in Elk Lake, Michigan.

She proved to be both a confidante and advisor to her students, but also cautioned against falling into the trappings of social life that could be found in the collegiate experience. In many ways her advice is still relevant to women seeking an education today. Early life and education Lloyd was born on December 9, 1893, in Ann Arbor, MI. She was the first child of Alfred H. Lloyd and Margaret Crocker Lloyd. Academia ran in her family; her father was the former dean of the University of Michigan's graduate school, a former professor of philosophy, and also served as acting president of the University in 1925. She had a relatively typical upbringing, growing up on what was at the time the outskirts of Ann Arbor and attending the now defunct Ann Arbor High and later Milton Academy in Milton, MA. She liked to collect poems as a child, showing a romantic side to her often described ambitious nature. Alice had a sister, Anna in addition to brothers Frederick and Putnam. Frederick T. Lloyd fought in World War I and unfortunately suffered from PTSD after his return home. He spent the rest of his life in a Battle Creek veteran's hospital. Putnam later moved on to become a doctor and move to New York. Lloyd's family had deep roots in the country. She is the descendant through her mother's side of John Putnam, a prominent early settler in Salem, MA. During the summer the Lloyds would go to Piseco, NY in the Adirondacks where they engaged in numerous outdoor activities like canoeing, hiking and swimming. Lloyd found the latter to be the most enjoyable and took very easily to it. As a student, she was described as being serious and successful. Lloyd also had very progressive ideas for her time, most likely due to her liberal father and mother who had moved from the East coast. For undergraduate school she attended the University of Michigan and graduated in 1916. During her undergraduate years she was considered a devoted friend and engaged in theatre, becoming an excellent singer. This showed in her election to the soloist position at Ann Arbor's local Episcopal Church. However, her educational experience was marred by an overseas battle; World War I broke out during her time at Michigan. This ultimately led to her post-graduation decision to stay close to home. She spent time teaching at a small school for two years. Later on, she served time training at the Luke's Hospital Training School of Nurses in New York City and earned her R.N. certificate in 1921. She subsequently worked as a probation officer with juvenile delinquent girls in Wayne County, Detroit. She was offered a position in 1926 as an Adviser of Women's Studies at the University of Michigan, which then led to her receiving the position as Dean of Woman in 1930.  Dean of women  One of Lloyd's crowning achievements during her years at Michigan was the development of women's dormitories. Two major residence halls were built under her watchful eye; Stockwell and Mosher‚ÄîJordan. She also was beneficial in the planning of the dorm that would eventually bear her name. Supportive programs for the female students were very important to her as well. The Women's Athletic Building was just one of the many programs that advanced the quality of life for these undergraduate women due to her efforts. Most notably, was her dedication to the Michigan League, which was newly completed when she began her term as Dean. It proved to be a headquarters for activities of women students as well as for alumnae. This was a pivotal time for women in higher education, particularly at Michigan. Lloyd knew this and dealt with it in a reserved and mature manner, especially when it came to women's hours and overcrowding in housing. She wrote editorials in the Daily, attempting to bridge the gap between faculty and students. This was frequently a sore spot due to the shifting position over in loco parentis, which was causing an irritation amongst the student body in regards to the strict curfew hours women held. Additionally, the lack of student housing for women with the influx of students was turning into a bigger problem than seen in past years. Alice was not a champion for Greek Life, which had become popular at the time she came to her position at the University. She believed school had become a place where social life mattered more than the academics. The experience outside of the classroom had become just as important as the academics. Despite her attitude that school should be a place for learning, away from social distractions, Lloyd still maintained an idealistic view on the world and education. In a speech given to the National Association of Deans of Women from January, 1944 she stated, \\"Education must be inspired by courageous and spiritual leadership and must touch the hearts of people as well as train their minds.\\" Additionally, in a speech given at the American Legion Auxiliary Services on August 16, 1945, she said, \\"It is through generosity and compassion and honesty and love that we will build a new world.\\" Lloyd was often at odds with an administration that was still stuck in the past. She grappled with the need for more authority in her position as Dean of Women. In a letter to Provost James P. Adams on October 20, 1945, she expressed her displeasure with the \\"relationship\\" between the Dean of Women and the women's residence halls stating: > \\"I feel very keenly that the direction of the educational program, i.e. > language tables, forums, etc., the social program, the student government > organization, and the supervision and choice of the personnel dealing > directly with the students (the house directors and new assistants) should > be the responsibility of the Dean of Women.\\" Relationship with Greek Life Despite her displeasure towards the institution itself, Lloyd would frequently insert herself into the politics of the Greek System at the school and sometimes saw it as beneficial to student life; it provided student housing and a place to engage in structured activities outside of the classroom. She was vocal about her beliefs and had no trouble expressing them to the fraternities and sororities as a whole, often speaking at Panhellenic meetings. These speeches were very transparent and produced very reasonable yet, forward thinking ideas: > \\"It is my belief that social organizations such as sororities and > fraternities should choose their members solely on a basis of character, > integrity, and personality without regard to race or nationality or > religious creed.\\" and > \\"To stress their value as house-clubs is to bring them into direct > competition with the dormitories which in many instances now offer better > living conditions. To emphasize the social life they offer is to bring very > forcibly to light the fact that the social situation has changed from the > earlier intimate group life within the sorority house to the present day > social activities outside the house. Both these factors have weakened their > position. What will strengthen it?\\"  Personal life and accomplishments  Not much is known about Alice's personal life outside of the walls of the University, partially because her personal endeavors were so entrenched in the care and keeping of her pupils. She was described as being tall with strong features, yet despite this she would never marry. Her parents in comparison appeared to have a happy courtship filled with love letters. Her younger sister, Anna would also come to marry. Nevertheless, Alice was the godmother to many of her friends' children and took great interest in her pupils, turning the professional into the personal. Lloyd was also incredibly active outside of the University, proving to be a prominent figure in the Ann Arbor community. She was a member of the Episcopal Church in Ann Arbor, serving as the Chairman of the Music Committee and also a member of the Ann Arbor Dramatic Season Chamber of Commerce in Ann Arbor where she would serve on the executive committee from 1937-42. This interest in the arts would present itself in town life; her shared home with her mother and aunt became a gathering space for artists and performers. She even served during 1936 as a member of the Board of Directors for Cranbrook Kingswood School. Also having an interest in politics, she became a member of the Democratic Party. She was a member of the National Association of Deans of Women, the American Association of University Women, Phi Beta Kappa, and Phi Kappa Phi. Her dedication to the University of Michigan led her to become the president of the Association of Deans of Women from 1941 to 1943. She also served on the committees for the American Council on Education. Commitment to nursing and war efforts Lloyd was very involved in the war efforts during WWII. She was appointed to the State's Advisory committee for the Women's Army Corps and to two national committees for the U.S. Navy: the special committee on college women students and the war, and the advisory education council on women's services. She proved so instrumental in these efforts that she was awarded the Navy's certificate of recognition. She also often spoke to nursing students about their duties not only to the country and soldiers under their care, but to themselves. In a speech given to nursing students she remarked: > \\"It is important that you have outside interests, but it is even more > important that you have great interest in your profession, that you see it > on the high plane where it belongs in order that you may have pride in it. I > am interested in education because it is the only hope in a democratic > country like ours. The striving of man for an education is an effort on his > part to understand better the universe in which he lives.\\"  Death  Alice Lloyd's story would unfortunately come to a close too soon. She died only at the age of 56 on March 3, 1950, after suffering from a longterm illness. She died in her home on 1735 Washtenaw Ave, the same house she was raised in. She was survived by her mother, sister and two brothers. Her death deeply affected her friends, family and the community at large. The new women's residence hall constructed during her time as Dean was named in her honor following her death. In a letter to Lloyd's sister addressing the naming of the new women's dorm after Alice, the acting Dean of Women, Sarah L. Healy speaks of trying to get in touch with Lloyd's mother to tell of the event, but had been advised not to, due to the sensitive nature of the matter.  Post-mortem  Many people dedicated their time to creating memorials and funds in Lloyd's name post death. A significant amount of effort was put into creating these, which shows just how much of an impact she made on the life of her students. There is not much released to the public about Lloyd despite her being a figure who fought for educational programs to benefit women at a time when progressive movements had not taken preeminence. This is most clearly shown in a correspondence between the editor of A Biographical Dictionary and Mary T. Bromage, who spent significant time on a biography of Lloyd over whether she should be included in the dictionary. The editor, Edward James believed Lloyd did not have much influence outside of Michigan despite her numerous leadership positions before her death. Nevertheless, her legacy continues to live on to this day and is seen in the numerous advancements that women have made at the University of Michigan and in higher education as a whole.

The earliest escape the room game called ‚ÄòOrigin‚Äô dates back from 2006 and was created in Silicon Valley by a group of system programmers. In the same year, similar games became popular throughout China and then Japan. From 2007, the concept became a worldwide phenomenon, with over 360 companies running live escape games at the moment. Origins clueQuest opened in June 2013 and is the brainchild of four Hungarian brothers with a love for puzzles: Gabor, Peter, Gergely and Zoltan. The creators of clueQuest wanted to bring to the British live escape game market a concept similar to Parapark - an escape room highly regarded in the competitive market in Hungary. Initially based in Tottenham Hale, then near Liverpool Street station, clueQuest now operates from a new location near King's Cross St. Pancras. Format The Game clueQuest revolves around the spy-world of Mr Q, who is also the image of the brand. Participating teams have 60 minutes to escape the rooms using teamwork and common sense logic to gather clues and solve the puzzles. clueQuest is an accessible experience to both children and adults. The Missions Aspiring secret agents can pick from three available missions: PLAN52, Operation BlackSheep and Revenge of the Sheep. =PLAN52= PLAN52 is a real life escape room and the first spy-themed mission created by clueQuest, London.

Gergana Dimitrova is a member of the new wave of Bulgarian theatre which succeeded to the one which developed during the years after the end of the communist pro-Sovietic regime in 1989. Veneta Doytcheva, a Bulgarian theatre critic, writes about this new wave: \\"The new wave rejects marketing and doesn't accept that the theatre should lose its critical function either. After a period of political apathy, the new generation wants to ask politically and socially committed questions. We are waiting for this trend to develop because, for the moment, it's more a draft than a strongly expressed platform. The youngest directors aren't at all \\"spoiled children\\". As always, young people doesn't accept compromises and don't accept work imposed on them from the outside or because of market needs. The freedom of choice is strongly expressed in the selection of plays that are staged. There is a genuine tendency to defend the texts of new European playwrights (Elfride Jelinek, Fritz Kater, Marius von Mayenburg, Torsten Buchsteiner). The non- conformity, revolt, and anxiety revealed in these texts correspond to the living and working conditions of young Bulgarians. The difference in comparison with the previous generation is in the respect of the text and rigorous work on the structure. These young artists look for authors who best represent them and make the most of the literary richness of their plays.\\"Doytcheva Veneta, \\"The New Bulgarian Wave in Search of Intimacy\\", UBU European stages, n¬∞48/49 , July 2010, p.55 Gergana Dimitrova with two other theatre directors, Mladen Alexiev and Vassilena Radeva, founded in 2007 \\"36 Singes\\", a NGO \\"for contemporary alternative art and culture\\".\\"36 monkeys\\" website Each one of them keeps and expresses his personality in his own creations.

Chios had participated in the Greek uprising against the Ottoman Empire, but had been captured and its population massacred by the Ottoman fleet in 1822. Historical background In the last months of 1827, as independence loomed, the Greek rebels launched simultaneous military operations from Peloponnese to Chios, Crete, eastern and western Greece. This happened because they were very concerned that large areas would remain outside the prospective Greek state, even areas that had revolted and had suffered many hardships during the previous stages of the War of Independence. In 1827, Chian merchants who lived in Syros sent letters to the Greek government begging them to undertake an expedition to regain Chios. The newly formed Chian Committee sent a letter to their fellow Chian, Adamantios Korais, asking him to find basic resources (like water and food) for the campaign. The Vice-gubernatorial Committee that administered Greece until the arrival of Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias ordered Sir Richard Church to assign the task of recovering Chios to Charles Nicolas Fabvier in August 1827. At first, Fabvier didn't act, but soon began organizing an expeditionary force of 600-700 men, mostly from the regular army, as well as a small artillery force (4 field guns, 6-7 siege guns, 3 mortars). The force was complemented by 200 cavalry (although less than a quarter actually had horses), which did not arrive until November, and over a thousand irregulars from Central Greece and Chian refugees. Initial campaign The expedition assembled at the island of Psara, near Chios, which likewise had been captured and ravaged by the Ottomans in 1824. The expeditionary force landed on Chios on 17 October, facing the Ottoman garrison of 2,000 men under Yusuf Pasha. The next day, the Greek fleet under Thomas Cochrane offloaded further 5 mortars and 1,000 shells. The Greek expedition had already caused the reaction of the Great Powers, whose admirals in the Aegean on 12 October had issued a proclamation opposing any renewed uprising on Chios. Undeterred, Fabvier defeated the first Ottoman forces that opposed him, forcing them to shut themselves in the medieval Castle of Chios, which he laid siege to. The siege was incomplete, however, as Fabvier lacked a fleet to blockade the fortress from the sea as well. The Portuguese Antonio Figueira d' Almeida was commander of the Greek cavalry at Chios Œë serious problem that Fabvier was facing was the order from the French admiral Henri de Rigny to quit and leave. Fabvier replied that he only took orders from the Greek government. On 5 November 1827 he was reinforced by the cavalry under the philhellene Portuguese colonel Antonio Figueira d'Almeida. Few days later the famed mine-digger Konstantinos Lagoumitzis came to the island in order to help undermine the walls of the castle. At the same time, Fabvier launched raids on the Anatolian shores, and prepared a large-scale attack on the port of √áesme, in conjunction with a fireship attack under Konstantinos Kanaris against the ships in port there. In the event, string winds prevented the execution of this operation. A similar raid against the environs of Smyrna was thwarted after the brig Sotir sunk in a storm on 6 January 1828. Ottoman garrison On 12 January, the Ottomans launched a strong sortie against the poorly guarded bastion of the Greek siege lines, and soon made rapid progress until stopped by the strong resistance of irregulars under the kapetanios Gekas, who bought precious time for the intervention of the 2nd Regular Battalion, which drove the Turks back. Fabvier himself, seeing Turkish banners on his trenches, took the 3rd Battalion and recaptured the original bastion the Turks had captured. The Turks lost 240 (according to other sources as many as 524) men, but the victory was not decisive as the blockade remained loose. The new governor, Kapodistrias, sent money and reinforcements to the island and ordered the fleet to assist, but the situation was critical: the Chian Committee had ceased providing pay and supplies to the troops, while the exactions of the irregular fighters exacerbated relations with the locals. Evacuation Finally, on 27 February 1828, an Ottoman squadron drove away the Greek ships aiding the siege. On the next day, they escorted 3,000 troops from √áesme across the sea to Chios. The first attempts to land elsewhere on the island were thwarted by the regular Greek troops, forcing the Ottomans to land in the fortress. Their arrival led to the collapse of morale of the Chian population, many of whom fled the island. Fabvier decided to lift the siege and withdraw, and in early March, he and his men were evacuated from the island.

Her husband, Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, and his colleagues named a number of taxa after her. Biography Cockerell was born Wilmatte Porter in Leon, Iowa, in 1869. She attended Stanford University and graduated from there in 1898. From 1899 she taught biology at New Mexico Normal School in Las Vegas, New Mexico. There she met Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, a self- taught entomologist from England specialising in Hymenoptera, who was also employed at that college. Theodore was an extremely prolific author of new species; he had begun officially describing species at twelve years of age, eventually described over 9,000 new species of bees alone, and authoring over 3,900 papers, almost the record. Theodore had set up what he called the 'New Mexico biological station' at the Agricultural Experiment Station in Mesilla a few years earlier, but in 1899 he moved it to Las Vegas, where he used the facilities of the New Mexico Normal School (he was employed there himself the following year). Theodore used it to teach summer classes in applied biology to mostly public school teachers, with which he mostly had them collecting specimens of organisms, especially of Hymenoptera. Some of the results from this work Theodore jointly published with Cockerell in 1899. Cockerell married Theodore on June 19, 1900. She was his second wife. After her marriage she frequently went on collecting expeditions with Theodore. As well as accompanying her husband on field trips, she sometimes collaborated with him on his scientific research and writing. After her marriage Cockerell combined teaching with collecting, and wrote a number of papers on entomology, some as sole author.Cockerell, W. P. \\"Collecting Bees in Southern Texas\\". Journal of the New York Entomological Society Vol. 25, No. 3 (Sep., 1917), pp. 187‚Äì193Cockerell, W. P. \\"Some Aphids Associated With Ants\\". Psyche: A Journal of Entomology 10, no. 325-326 (1903), pp. 216‚Äì218 She was much better than her husband at catching insects, on some field trips out-collecting him nine to one. Both Cockerells were badly paid, and it is known Wilmatte sometimes supplemented the family income by selling specimens she obtained while on her field trips to professional full-time insect collectors, who in some cases altered the collection locality on the labels to make the insects appear more exotic and increase their value. In 1904 Cockerell and her husband moved to Boulder, Colorado, where Cockerell was employed as a biology teacher at the Colorado State Preparatory School. She continued at that high school for much of her teaching career. Deep red sunflower In 1910 Cockerell discovered a red sunflower across the road from her home in a field. This sunflower was a mutant that she and Theodore transferred to their garden. Theodore proceeded to study and cultivate it further, developing the mutation to the point where he sold it to seed companies. Seed companies such as Peter Henderson & Co, Sutton & Sons, and Burpee marketed the red sunflower seeds throughout the world. The Cockerells were awarded a medal for their work on these sunflowers at the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition at San Francisco in 1915. Field trips In August 1902 Cockerell took a field trip to Truchas Peak, Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, where she collected bees and other insects. This trip resulted in her first scientific report published as sole author, A trip to the Truchas Peaks, New Mexico in the journal The American Naturalist. In 1906 the Cockerells visited the Florissant Fossil Beds with Sievert Allen Rohwer and W. M. Wheeler, and with them collected specimens and published various articles about the fossil insects found at this site. During the summers after 1911, the Cockerells undertook various field trips the world over collecting bees, insects, and studying flora and fauna. During these field trips, as well as providing specimens for her husband's research, Cockerell's collecting also provided other entomologists with specimens to research. In 1912 Cockerell and her husband traveled to Guatemala. There she collected numerous insect specimens including many wasps, some of which were species previously unknown to science. These were studied by Rohwer who named two species after her. Also in 1912, while traveling in Guatemala, Cockerell collected three specimens of cacti for National Herbarium at the Smithsonian. These were sent to the botanists Nathaniel Lord Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose. They reclassified their just described Hylocereus minutiflorus as a monotypic species in the genus Wilmattea in her honor, although this change has since been rescinded. In August 1918, Cockerell and her husband went on a field trip to Peaceful Valley, Colorado, where again she collected specimens of numerous species previously unknown to science. Cockerell and her husband traveled to the United Kingdom in 1921, and visited the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. In 1923 Cockerell and Theodore undertook a trip to Japan. They traveled on the steamer Aleut. While in Japan they had a narrow escape in the Great Kant≈ç earthquake. The Denver Times reported that Cockerell and her husband were believed lost in the catastrophe. In the later half of 1931 into 1932 the Cockerells went to Africa on what they christened the \\"Cockerell- Mackie-Ogilvie Expedition\\". The expedition visited many areas of Africa including the Congo where the group collected over 16,000 specimens, especially of bees. Once again numerous specimens of various species were collected by them that up until then had been unknown to science. After Theodore retired, Cockerell spent her winters with her husband in California. They both worked as volunteer curators at the Desert Museum in Palm Springs, California, from 1941. They were not paid for this work but did receive housing as part compensation until 1945. In 1946 Cockerell and her husband began working at Escuela Agricola Panamericana in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. After Theodore died in San Diego, California, in 1948, Cockerell taught at Piney Woods School near Jackson, Mississippi. Death Cockerell died March 15, 1957, in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. She is buried in Columbia Cemetery, Boulder.California Death Index, 1940-1997. Works In February 1904 Science Magazine published a short article Porter had sent in about a local plant she mistakenly called Picradenia odorata utilis which a friend had suggested might be a source of rubber, and that her husband had begun to research. The plant had actually just been described in 1903 in the first issue of a new local Colorado scientific magazine as P. floribunda utilis, although in September of 1904 her husband moved it to Hymenoxys floribunda utilis. It is now considered a synonym of H. richardsonii var. floribunda. *Cockerell, T. D. A,; Porter, W. :VIII.‚ÄîContributions from the New Mexico biological station‚ÄîIX. On certain genera of bees\\".

She inherited a large fortune from her great-grandmother, the founder of the Veuve Clicquot Champagne house. She was known for her involvement in feminist causes and charities, politics, sport hunting, automobiles and the arts, and was an accomplished author and sculptor. Early life Anne with her great-grandmother, Madame Clicquot Ponsardin, founder of Veuve Clicquot Marie Adrienne Anne Victurnienne Cl√©mentine de Rochechouart de Mortemart was born on 10 February 1847 in Paris. She was the daughter of Louis de Rochechouart, Count of Mortemart, and Marie Cl√©mentine de Chevign√© (died 24 October 1877). The Neo-Renaissance style Ch√¢teau de Boursault, designed by the architect Arveuf, was built by Madame Clicquot Ponsardin, founder of the Veuve Clicquot Champagne house, in honor of the marriage of her granddaughter Marie Cl√©mentine to Louis de Mortemard- Rochechouart in 1839. Anne inherited the chateau on Madame Clicquot's death in 1866. Marriage On 10 May 1867, Anne married Emmanuel de Crussol (1840‚Äì1878) (:fr:Emmanuel de Crussol d'Uz√®s), 12th Duke of Uz√®s. He was elected to the legislature in 1871, sat on the right and voted against creation of the Republic. Their children were: * Jacques Marie G√©raud de Crussol (1868‚Äì1893), who became the 13th Duke before his death in 1893 during an expedition that he was leading in Africa. * Simone Louise Laure de Crussol (1870‚Äì1946), who married Honor√© d'Albert, 10th Duke of Luynes (1868‚Äì1924). * Louis Emmanuel de Crussol (1871‚Äì1943), who became the 14th Duke after his brother's death in 1893; he married Marie Th√©r√®se d'Albert de Luynes. He later married American Josephine Angela (1886‚Äì1966) in 1939. Their grandson, Emmanuel de Crussol d'Uz√®s, became the 15th Duke of Uz√®s in 1943. * Mathilde Ren√©e de Crussol (1875‚Äì1908), who married Fran√ßois de Coss√© Brissac, 11th Duke of Brissac.Anne Marie Timol√©on Fran√ßois Coss√©-Brissac (duc de, 1868-1944), Biblioth√®que nationale de France On her husband's death in 1878 Anne remained dowager Duchess of Uz√®s. She became \\"a sportswoman, an author, an artist, a sculptor, a chauffeuse, a ministering angel to the poor, a grande mondaine, and an industrious mother.\\" Career and philanthropy Ch√¢teau de Boursault The Duchess of Uz√®s was a strong supporter of the conservative and royalist politician Georges Ernest Boulanger (1837‚Äì91), and donated more than three million francs to his cause, a large sum at the time. She convinced Prince Philippe, Count of Paris to support Boulanger in the hope of a restoration of the monarchy. The Duchess of Uz√®s provided support to the F√©d√©ration nationale des Jaunes de France. The \\"Jaune\\" movement was organized to break trade union strikes. She also financed several antisemitic newspapers. Later she dropped her opposition to the Republican administration. She became a friend of the anarchist Louise Michel. The Duchess of Uz√®s was active in Paris society, and participated in many charities. She also became involved in feminist and suffragist causes. In January 1893, Jeanne Schmahl founded the Avant-Courri√®re (Forerunner) association, which called for the right of women to be witnesses in public and private acts, and for the right of married women to take the product of their labor and dispose of it freely. The campaign aimed to mobilize middle- and upper-class women who had moderate and conservative views. Anne de Rochechouart de Mortemart and Juliette Adam (1836‚Äì1936) soon joined the Avant-Courri√®re, and Schmahl found support from Jane Misme (1865‚Äì1935), who later founded the journal La Fran√ßaise and Jeanne Chauvin (1862‚Äì1926), the first woman to become a doctor of law. The Duchess of Uz√®s was president of the National League for Improving Rural and Agricultural Industries (Ligue nationale pour le rel√®vement des industries rurales at agricoles). During World War I (1914‚Äì18) she let the army use her chateau at Bonnelles, which became an annex of the Rambouillet surgery hospital. At the age of 70 she took the examinations to become head nurse. She played a personal role in organizing care for the wounded. She also founded a child care school, and became a member of the Anti-Cancer League, helping to gain support for the league from her wide network of influential people. Leisure activities Duchesse d'Uz√®s hunting at Rambouillet (1913) Duchesse d'Uz√®s, President of the Women's Automobile Club (1927) The Duchess of Uz√®s was keen on sport hunting, and led the Rallye Bonnelles in the Rambouillet forest from the 1880s until her death. This caused her to be expelled from the Animal Protection Society. \\"Kings, princes and presidents of the Republic\\" attended the hunts that she arranged at her estate of Bonnelles. When aged 80, in July 1926 she took her oath at the Rambouillet Civil Court as Lieutenant de Louveterie, an official position related to regulation of hunting. In 1889 The Epoch (New York) wrote, \\"The Duchess, who is now a little over forty, is short and dumpy, and appears to best advantage when on horseback. She has a kindly, intelligent face, chestnut hair and laughing blue eyes... It was at Bonnelles that the Duchess received the Empress of Austria, who expressed her surprise and admiration at seeing a hunt organized and conducted by a woman with as much skill and perfection as though it had been arranged by a Master of the Hounds. At Paris the Duchess of Uzes inhabits the splendid mansion in the Champs-√âlys√©es, once belonging to Queen Christine, of Spain, and where the ornamented ceilings are by Fortuny...\\" The Duchess of Uz√®s was one of the first clients of √âmile Delahaye, a pioneer of the automobile industry. In 1898, she was the first women in France to obtain a driver's license, and in 1899 was the first to receive a speeding ticket. She had driven at in the Bois de Boulogne where the speed limit was . She was president of the Aeroclub Ladies' Committee. Artistic endeavors Duchess of Uz√®s working on a sculpture of Jeanne D‚ÄôArc (1900), by Adolphe Demange The Duchess wrote and published poems, plays, novels and histories. She painted and sculpted, using the pseudonym \\"Manuela\\". Her work was exhibited at the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais, and she received an honorable mention in the 1887 Salon. The Duchess of Uz√®s was a friend of the sculptor Jean-Alexandre-Josef Falgui√®re (1831‚Äì1900), who gave her lessons. She made sculptures of Diana, √âmile Augier, Nicolas Gilbert, Notre-Dame de France (the Virgin Mary), Saint Hubert and Joan of Arc. She became president of the Union of Female Painters. She was also president of the women's Lyceum Club of France (Lyc√©um-Club de France). A 1900 painting by Adolphe Demange (1857-1928) shows her working on a monumental clay statue of Joan of Arc in Falgui√®re's studio. The painting is signed \\"To the valiant artist-sculptor Mme La Duchesse d‚ÄôUz√®s, tribute of the painter A.D.

The MagicBands form the central part of the MyMagic+ experience, providing a way for the system to connect data to guests. This includes connecting park tickets, hotel room keys, payments, and PhotoPass information to the MagicBands. The bands were announced on January 7, 2013 by Tom Staggs as a part of MyMagic+. Development MagicBands were developed alongside the MyMagic+ program as a way to tie all of the different elements of the program together. The MagicBand idea came at the start of the Next Generation Experience (the code name for what became MyMagic+), when one of the original five members of the project, business development VP John Padgett, was on a flight between Burbank, the Walt Disney Company's headquarters, and Orlando, the location of Walt Disney World. Padgett saw a magnetic therapy wristband in a SkyMall magazine, which claimed to ease sore muscles \\"while simultaneously improving one's golf swing\\". He and the project team began considering the design of a wristband encoded with \\"everything a guest might need‚Äîpark tickets, photos, coupons, even money\\". Soon afterward, they created a makeshift xBand (the original code name for the MagicBand) using a velcro strip, a plastic liner, and an RFID tag. The original MagicBand design was created by Frog Design. The original design consisted of an outer plastic grey bracelet, which can be removed to adjust for a smaller sized wrist, and an inner plastic bracelet. The inner plastic bracelet is one of eight base colors, which can then have a series of different designs printed on them for an extra fee. Sealed inside of the middle of the inner band is the circuitry, consisting of high frequency and ultra-high frequency antennas and a coin cell battery, all embedded on a PCB board. Directly outside of the circuitry is an outline of Mickey Mouse's head on the front, while the back includes the Band ID, the FCC ID number, and other information. On November 19, 2016, a new MagicBand design, MagicBand 2, was announced. The new design increases the size of the Mickey head and the circuitry area. This part, called the Icon, is able to be removed from the rest of the wristband with a special screwdriver and placed in other bands or special accessories such as a key-chain. Implementation Until January 1st, 2021, MagicBands are free to Disney Resort guests and annual passholders. While other guests receive a card with an RFID chip inside, they are able to purchase a MagicBand online or at the parks. Touchpoints, consisting of a ring with an outline of Mickey Mouse's head, are located at park entry points, Fastpass+ entry points, PhotoPass locations, and point of sales location. When a guest walks up to one, they place their MagicBand's circuitry location against the center of the ring (known as putting \\"Mickey to Mickey\\"), in order to engage the system. The ring and outline on the touchpoint will then light up green if access is granted, while it will turn blue if cast member assistance is required. Some special edition MagicBands with graphics printed on them will cause the touchpoints to light up different colors and make different noises instead of the default green, when access is granted. An example of this is the red lightsaber Star Wars themed MagicBand, which changed the default green to red. In normal settings, the touchpoints will never turn red, due to the negative connotation of the color. Handheld MagicBand readers are used at sit-down restaurants for point of sales and by PhotoPass photographers to link photos. These handheld readers do not have the light up features of the touchpoints. The MagicBands are also used to connect guests' on-ride photos to their PhotoPass using the long-range ultra-high frequency radio without guests having to use touchpoints to associate the pictures to their account. The MagicBands also allow guests to interact, using a system called Storymaker, with screens in rides or queues, such as it's a small world, Rock 'n' Roller Coaster starring Aerosmith, Haunted Mansion, and Expedition Everest. On February 13, 2017, it was announced that over 29 million MagicBands had been made. The MagicBand system has also been used to enforce COVID-19 safety protocols inside the NBA Bubble for the resumption of the 2019-20 NBA season at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex; access to courts and practice facilities requires scanning a MagicBand in order to verify that the wearer has completed mandatory health monitoring protocols. Competitors Universal's TapuTapu On November 3, 2016, Walt Disney World competitor Universal Orlando announced the TapuTapu system for their new water park, Volcano Bay. The system allows Volcano Bay guests to tap their wristbands to a touchpoint, which will then place them in a virtual queue. Fifteen minutes before their wait time is up, the device will vibrate to let the wearer know that they should head back to the attraction. However, guests have to return the TapuTapu at the end of the day, unlike Magicbands that can be kept and reused by the guests. In addition, an RFID wristband system, manufactured by the Slovene corporation Metra in≈æeniring, is employed at the Blue Lagoon in Iceland as an entry pass, storage locker key, and payment method for food and drinks. However, similarly to the TapuTapu, the Blue Lagoon's RFID wristbands must be returned at the end of one's stay, and a recovery mechanism is appropriately installed in the exit turnstiles.

Notability The villagers of Piplantri plants 111 trees every time a girl child is born and the community ensures these trees survive, attaining fruition as the girls grow up. India has a huge deficit of girls because society is obsessed with the male child and girls are considered financial burdens because of the dowry practices. Over the years, people here have managed to plant over 300,000 trees on the village's grazing commons - including Neem, Sheesham, Mango, Amla among others. To ensure the financial security, after the birth of a girl child, the villagers contribute Rs 21,000 collectively and take Rs 10,000 from the parents and put it in a fixed deposit bank account, which can be used only after she turns 18. To make sure that girl child receives a proper education, the villagers make the parents sign an affidavit (legal contract) which restricts them from marrying her off before she attains the legal age for marriage. Shyam Sundar Paliwal, the former sarpanch (elected village head) started this initiative in the memory of his daughter Kiran, who died a few years ago. The initiative that began in 2006 has turned Piplantri village into an oasis. The birth of a girl child is now welcomed and the village is covered with Neem, Mango, Amla and Sheesham trees leading to a higher water level and richer wildlife. The initiative has also helped the town‚Äôs economy. To keep termites away from the trees, many of which bear fruit, the village has planted more than 2.5 million Aloe vera plants around them. Gradually, the villagers realized that Aloe vera could be processed and marketed in a variety of ways. So the community now produces and markets aloe-based products like juice and gel, among other things.

On his first solo assignment, Casper was shot and killed in Fond du Lac attempting to apprehend a bank robbery and murder suspect on March 24, 2015. He was the youngest police officer killed in the line of duty in Wisconsin. \\\\-  Early life and career  Casper was born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and later moved to Kiel with his family, where he was a 2011 graduate of Kiel High School and was on the school's soccer and wrestling teams. He studied at Lakeshore Technical College in Cleveland, Wisconsin, where he graduated in May 2014 with a degree in criminal justice. In college, he was the student government president and active in the color guard. Casper began his training to become a Wisconsin State Trooper at the Wisconsin State Patrol Academy at Fort McCoy on July 13, 2014. In December that year, Casper was sworn in as a trooper.  Death  The suspect, Steven Snyder, was believed to have robbed a bank in Wausaukee, Wisconsin earlier on March 24, 2015. Approximately one hour after the bank robbery, Snyder abandoned the vehicle he was driving, shot dead a 59-year-old man, and stole a second vehicle. Casper located the second vehicle as it was being driven southbound on Interstate 41 in Fond du Lac and began following it. He was directing Trooper Clarissa Justmann, Sgt. Andrew Hyer, and Capt. Tony Burrell to their location when Snyder pulled into a Pick 'n Save supermarket parking lot and stopped. Snyder discharged nine 5.7mm shots from an FN Five-seven pistol at Casper, who was hit by three rounds in the neck, chest and left hand. Casper, though mortally wounded, discharged 12 .40-caliber rounds from his Glock duty weapon, and struck Snyder once in the chest, fatally wounding him. Casper was pronounced dead en route to the hospital. It was announced on July 12, 2016, that Casper would be inducted into the State of Wisconsin Fire & Police Hall of Fame.  The suspect  Police confirmed 38-year-old Steven Timothy Snyder from Michigan shot and killed Casper in the shootout. Snyder was also killed in the exchange of gunfire. Twenty years earlier, Snyder had been a member of a white supremacy group.  Response and reactions  Before the shooting involving Casper, the Fond du Lac Police Department had been investigating a bank robbery just blocks away. The day following the shooting, Governor Scott Walker issued a statement saying, \\"Trooper Trevor Casper was killed while bravely serving his community and doing his duty to keep our citizens safe.

DDDM becomes more important in education since federal and state test-based accountability policies. No Child Left Behind Act opens broader opportunities and incentives in using data by educational organizations by requiring schools and districts to analyze additional components of data, as well as pressing them to increase student test scores. Information makes schools accountable for year by year improvement various student groups. DDDM helps to recognize the problem and who is affected by the problem; therefore, DDDM can find a solution of the problem Purpose The purpose of DDDM is to help educators, schools, districts, and states to use information they have to actionable knowledge to improve student outcomes. DDDM requires high-quality data and possibly technical assistance; otherwise, data can misinform and lead to unreliable inferences. Data management techniques can improve teaching and learning in schools. Test scores are used by many principals to identify ‚Äúbubble kids‚Äù, students whose results are just below proficiency level in reading and mathematics. Types of data used in education There are 4 major types of data used in education: demographics data, perceptions data, student learning data, and school processes data. 1\\\\. Demographics data in educational organizations answers the question, \\"Who are we?\\". Demographics show the current context of the school and shows the trends. Trends help to predict and plan for the future, along with seeing measures where leaders work towards continuous school improvement. Thorough demographic data explains the structure of school, system, and the leadership. In education demographic data to the next items: number of students in the school, number of students with special needs, number of English learners, age or grade of students in cohorts, socio-economical status of students, attendance rates, ethnicity/race/religious beliefs, graduation rates, dropout rates, experience information of teachers, information about parents of students. 2\\\\. Perception data tells us what students, staff, and parents think about a school and answers the question, \\"How do we do business?\\". School culture, climate, and organizational processes are assessed by perception data. Perception data includes values, beliefs, perceptions, opinions, observations. Perception data is collected mostly questionnaires. Perception data can be differentiate by two groups: 1- staff, 2 - students and parents. Staff are being asked if any changes in instruction or curriculum need to take place. Students and parents are questioned to report their interests, how difficult material is to learn, how are they taught and treated. 3\\\\. Student learning data answers two questions: How are our students doing? and Where are we now? Student learning data requires information from all subject areas, disaggregated by demographic groups, by teachers, by grade level, by cohorts over time, and individual student growth. This type of data helps to address additional help to students who are not proficient, deepening into what they know and what they don't know to become proficient. Student learning data connects with curriculum, instruction, and assessment in order to improve outcomes. Student learning data can clearly state the effectiveness of a single educator or the entire school. SLD can be gathered by looking at diagnostic tests, formative assessments, performance assessments, standardized tests, non-referenced tests, summative assessments, teacher-assigned tests, and others. 4\\\\. School processes refer to actions of administrators and teachers to achieve the purpose of the school. Teachers' habits, customs, knowledge, and professionalism are the things leading towards progress inside organizations. School processes data tell us what works, what doesn't, the results of educational process, and answers the question, \\"What are our processes?\\". School processes produce school and class results. There are 4 major types of school processes: 1. instructional processes, 2. Organizational processes, 3. Administrative processes, 4. Continuous school improvement processes. Use in educational organizations The U.S. Department of Education and the Institute of Education Sciences require to use data and DDDM in past decades to run educational organizations. Hard evidence and the use of data are emphasized to inform decisions. The data in educational organizations means more than analyzing test scores. Educational data movement is considered as a sociotechnical revolution. Educational data systems involve technologies and evidence to explain districts', schools', classrooms' tendencies. DDDM is used to explain complexity of education, support collaboration, creating new designs of teaching. Student performance is central in DDDM. NCLB provided boost in the collection and use of educational information. For example, in a rural area educators tried to understand why a particular subset of students were struggling academically. Data analysts collected students performance data, medical records, behavioral data, attendance, and other data less qualitative information. After not finding direct correlation between collected data and student outcomes they decided to include transportation data into the research. As result, educators found that students who had longer way from houses to the school were struggling the most. According to the finding administrators modified transportation arrangements to make the way shorter for students as well as installing Internet access in buses so students could concentrate on doing homework. DDDM in this particular case helped to improve student results. Effects on schools Effective schools showing outstanding gains in academic measures report that the wide and wise use of data has a positive effect on student achievement and progress. DDDM is suggested to be a main tool to move educational organizations towards school improvement and educator effectiveness. Data can be used to measure growth over time, program evaluation along with identifying root causes of problems connected to education. Involving school teachers in data inquiry causes more collaborative work from staff. Data provides increasing communication and knowledge which has a positive effect on altering educator attitudes towards groups inside schools which are underperforming Notes General references * * Category:Data management Category:Standards-based education ","title":"Data based decision making"},{"id":"46235829","text":"The 2015 Wolverhampton City Council election took place on 7 May 2015, to elect members of the Wolverhampton City Council in England.

Projects  Hecht Park, Haifa  Hecht Park \\"Hecht Park\\" of about 75 dunam, is the largest intensive park in Haifa and is a component in the sequence of Haifa's coastal promenade. The park includes varied flora areas and emphasized the use of natural flora matching the existing coastal flora of the area. Furthermore, in the park there are wide lawns for public use. The park addresses a diverse target of users: families, children, adults, open air sports, bicycle riders, joggers etc. The park is located along the southern entry to the city and was built by the initiative of Haifa Municipality, in co-operation with Hecht Foundation.  Shikmona Coastal Park and Promenade, Haifa  Shikmona Coastal Park and Promenade Haifa Shikmona coast is a narrow strip of about 80 dunam, divided by the rail way from park Hecht. Shikmona coast is a National Park and a Marine Nature Reserve. Tel Shikmona is located at the north end of the park. Much effort was taken to preserve the existing coastal flora, as well as to reintroduce the local flora which had been typical of this area in the distant past. The coastal complex of Hecht Park and Shikmona Coastal Park is designated to respond to the ever- growing needs for recreation activities, exposing the city residents and its visitors to the ecological, landscape and archaeological values of this unique shore. Shikmona Coastal Park includes a pedestrian promenade of about 1 km and a bicycle path of 1.6 km. The park was erected by the initiative of Haifa Municipality, with the assistance of a contribution of the Electric Company. Israel Cross Highway (no. 6), Ramot Menashe section Israel Cross Highway (no. 6) This section of the Israel Cross Highway passes through a highly sensitive landscape of Oak hills. The road crosses also 11 river beds some of which are Nature Reserves. The landscape restoration concept was of an ecological-landscape, reconstructing the landscape, which had existed prior to carrying out the road, and blended into the natural and agricultural landscapes around the road. The plant restoration complements the \\"external\\" landscape and \\"interweaves\\" the patterns of the landscape around. Seeds, and geophytes were gathered, prior to carrying out the works, for sprouting local habitats. The use of local flor enables to reduce the water quantity required for irrigation and emphasizes the seasonal change experience of the country's landscapes. Greenstein Har-Gil Firm \\"accompanied\\" the engineering planning from its early stages. The landscape design included a landscape analysis, participating in determining the horizontal and vertical road route in order to minimize the environmental damage, examining the various alternatives and determining the location and length of the bridges and tunnels as well as planning the interchanges. Due to the landscape sensitivity of the area and the nature of the planning process, the landscape and environmental aspects received particularly great emphasis and importance and affected significantly the engineering of the road. Erecting the road was managed by Cross Israel Highway Company.

Reviewer Roderic Dunnett described it as Phizzical easily justifies its name: it fizzes and whizzes, sizzles and bristles and teases with comedy, makes you want to laugh and sing, and tickles you with a storyline that could be a cousin of The Comedy of Errors or Twelfth Night\\". His first musical was Precious Bazaar which opened in 2004 at The Y in Leicester. It launched the careers of actor Jas Binag and Bhopal: A Prayer of Rain actress Fagun Thakrar.

It is Gram-negative and anaerobic, with a straight to slightly curved rod-like morphology, and is motile with petritrichous flagella (i.e., flagella with diverse orientations from the cell body). It was not observed in culture to form spores. Phylogenetic relationships Based on sequencing of 16S rRNA, O. valericigenes is a member of the clostridial cluster IV, a subgroup of clostridial bacteria typically found in the alimentary canals of animals, including humans. Its closest cultured relatives at the time of its original description in 2007 were Clostridium orbiscindens (found in human feces) and Clostridium viride. It also exhibits a close relationship to Oscillospira guillermondii, a large bacterial species found in the guts of ruminant animals, which has yet to be grown in culture despite having been first observed in 1913. O. valericigenes is unusual in that its 16S rRNA more closely resembles that of uncultured bacteria in animal digestive tracts than the other cultured members of clostridial cluster IV. Its genome was sequenced in 2012 and found to contain some genes identifiably homologous to those known to be involved in sporulation; however, it is missing many genes involved in the later stages of sporulation that are widely distributed among clostridial bacteria. Metabolism O. valericigenes grows fermentatively, producing predominantly valerate when grown on a glucose carbon source. The bacteria were observed to grow in culture using D-glucose, L-arabinose, D-ribose, and D-xylose as carbon sources. Clinical significance O. valericigenes has been detected in the human intestinal microbiome. In one study of human gut microflora, O. valericigenes was found in significantly more samples from healthy control test subjects than from patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease.

History Beykpour and Bernstein came up with the idea for Periscope while traveling abroad in 2013. Beykpour was in Istanbul when protests broke out in Taksim Square. He wanted to see what was happening there, so he turned to Twitter. While he could read about the protests, he could not see them. They started the company in February 2014, under the name Bounty. They raised $1.5 million from Founder Collective, Scott Belsky, Maveron, Google Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Bessemer, Stanford ‚Äì StartX and Sam Shank in April 2014. Periscope was acquired January 2015 by Twitter before the product had been publicly launched. One investor source says the acquisition amount was \\"sizeable\\", above $50 million. Another says it fell between $75 and $100 million. A third says the deal was \\"small-ish\\". The acquisition was officially announced in a tweet from Periscope and retweeted by Twitter CEO Dick Costolo on 13 March after the rival video streaming app Meerkat was a breakout hit at South by Southwest 2015 (13‚Äì17 March). Meerkat became the talk of SXSW partially due to Twitter cutting Meerkat off from its social graph just as the festival was starting. Periscope was launched on 26 March 2015. Later, on 26 May 2015, Periscope was released for Android. On 12 August 2015, Periscope announced that it had surpassed 10 million accounts, four months after it was launched. At the same time, the company noted that the amount of video being watched had reached a level of \\"40 years per day\\". On 9 December 2015, Apple named Periscope as the iPhone App of the Year. On 26 January 2016, the company released an update that allows users to stream live from GoPro. In December 2016, some of Periscope's features were integrated into the main Twitter app. In April 2016, as part of a wider partnership with Twitter to stream selected Thursday Night Football games, the NFL announced that Periscope would feature ancillary behind the scenes content from these games. In June 2016, Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives staged a sit-in on the House floor to protest the lack of a vote on a gun control bill. The Speaker pro tem, Rep. Ted Poe, declared the House was in recess and subsequently the House video feed to C-SPAN was shut off. However, after a brief interruption, C-SPAN was able to broadcast the sit-in because Rep. Scott Peters streamed the activity and the speakers using his Periscope account. On 12 June 2018, a Turkish court banned Periscope in Turkey for violating the copyright of the Turkish company called Periskop. Periscope had been actively used by the Turkish opposition until an initial ban was put in place in April 2017, weeks before a constitutional referendum to expand presidential powers. Service The services of Periscope are available in the mobile application itself as well as on Twitter. Users of Periscope are able to choose whether or not to make their video public or simply viewable to certain users such as their friends or families. Although the \\"scoper\\", so-called, usually simply uses a handheld device such as a smartphone to broadcast, it is also possible to broadcast through Periscope using a professional vision mixing suite such as Wirecast or Teradek using Periscope Pro. Periscope allows viewers to send \\"hearts\\" to the broadcaster by tapping on the mobile screen as a form of appreciation. The maximum number of users that a user can follow is 8,000. Both the \\"scoper\\" and viewers of the so-called \\"scope\\" are able to block viewers. When blocked by the \\"scoper\\", users are added to a blocked list and booted from the \\"scope\\". If enough \\"scopers\\" block a user, they are blocked from the \\"scope\\". If they receive more than four blocks from four different \\"scopes\\" then the user gets shadowbanned. On 8 September 2015, TechCrunch reported and later confirmed that Periscope was building an Apple TV app. This app has been released.https://appadvice.com/tv/app/periscope-live-video- streaming/972909677 On 10 September 2015, Periscope added the ability to broadcast live in landscape view. Copyright issues As actress Alyssa Milano autographs copies of her graphic novel during an appearance at Midtown Comics in Manhattan, her assistant, Kelly Kall (left foreground) streams video of the event on Periscope. The app can be misappropriated for copyright infringement, an issue that was raised around the time of the app's launch when several users of the service used it to air the fifth-season premiere of HBO's Game of Thrones live. HBO has stated the service needs better tools and policies to deal with copyrighted content. These issues were magnified further by a professional boxing event on 2 May 2015, Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao, which was televised via a pay per view that cost approximately US$90, but saw wide unauthorised distribution through streams of various quality on Periscope. Rebroadcasting copyrighted content violates Periscope's written terms of service, and can result in suspension or banning the offending account. Other complaints have come from firms acting on behalf of the NFL, the Premier League, the US Open Tennis Championship and Taylor Swift, according to data from Chilling Effects, which tracks online takedown notices and was started by attorney Wendy Seltzer, several law school clinics and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Ultimate Fighting Championship, which has kept a close eye on people it believes are illegally streaming its pay per view mixed martial arts matches, has sent more than 650 takedown notices to Periscope, according to data from Chilling Effects. Resources As of 5 July 2016, Periscope released an update where users can choose whether to save their broadcasts or delete them after 24 hours. (Although \\"scopes\\" disappear from www.periscope.tv/username after 24 hours, users were able to capture their \\"scopes\\", and other live streaming apps, using Katch.me. It stopped collecting videos on 22 April 2016 and shut down on 4 May 2016.) A television channel based around Periscope is PeriscopeTV.

Early years Linick was born in Los Angeles on January 6, 1938.Linick (2008), p.56. His father, Leroy M. Linick, a screen story analyst at Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer, and his mother, n√©e Etta Gordon, separated soon thereafter. Linick grew up in the household of his mother and her new husband, the composer and conductor Ingolf Dahl.Linick (2008), pp.68-69. Linick attended a number of public schools in Los Angeles, including Alexander Hamilton High School, and in 1955 he began a ten-year experience on the campus of University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in Westwood. In 1959 he received his B.A. in history and the following year he earned a general secondary teaching credential. In 1964 he completed a Ph.D. in history. He spent a final year in Los Angeles as an instructor in the UCLA history department. Editorship of Nomad While still an undergraduate Linick launched an American \\"little magazine\\", Nomad, working with his co-editor, Donald Factor (the son of Max Factor, Jr.), on a number of issues, including the 1962 finale, Nomad/New York. Linick had enjoyed a great interest in the burgeoning poetry scene for a number of years.Birmingham (2007). Nomad offered a home to the early work of Charles Bukowski. Nomads inaugural issue in 1959 featured several of Bukowski's poems. A year later, Nomad published one of Bukowski's best known essays, Manifesto: A Call for Own Critics.Debritto (2013), p.90. Because of Nomad and his connections to avant garde poetry, Linick was present during the 1957 Howl trial in San Francisco. He watched coverage of Kennedy's assassination on Allen Ginsberg's TV in 1963. During summers spent in New York he also got to know many of the authors who dominated the anthologies in subsequent years. Knowing of his interest in such affairs, his mentor at UCLA, George Mowry, suggested he choose a dissertation topic from this world. The result was A History of the American Literary Avant-Garde Since World War II.Diggory (2009). In 2017 Linick published in Beat Scene magazine some of the original research for this dissertation, including responses to a questionnaire returned to him by Jack Kerouac, Alan Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, and Charles Bukovsky.Linick (2017). The event was of particular interest to Beat scholar James Campbell, who wrote about Linick's article in The Times Literary Supplement.Campbell (2018), p.40. Academic life In 1964 Linick married Dorothy Goldstone, another recent B.A. in history at UCLA, and the following year they moved to East Lansing, Michigan, where Linick had accepted an appointment as an Assistant Professor of Humanities at Michigan State University (MSU). He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1970 and to Professor in 1975, and enjoyed many and varied teaching opportunities. Linick taught the basic year-long western civilization course, one combining history, literature, religion, philosophy and the arts‚Äìa year-long offering that was then required of every MSU student‚Äìas well as courses in literature for MSU's Justin Morrill College and courses in contemporary and Jewish culture. He led MSU's first overseas study program in Israel in 1977. Increasingly, Linick‚Äôs scholarly activities were concentrated in the field of popular culture, particularly television, then a new academic discipline, and he and Dorothy were participants in the first convention of the Popular Culture Association. Linick contributed two articles to the Journal of Popular Culture in the 1970s and made several additional presentations at Popular Cultural Association conventions thereafter. The focus of his research was on British popular culture, which he and his wife were able to experience first-hand with almost annual visits to London. Linick led an overseas study program there in 1970 and enjoyed two sabbatical leaves in London, one in 1973 and one in 1979-1980. In 1981 the couple moved to the U.K. In 1982 Linick began a twenty-year tenure as a member of the faculty of the American School in London (ASL) in St John's Wood. There he taught courses for both the social studies and the English departments, moving permanently to the latter in 1988 and serving as its chair for the last eight years of his teaching career, 1994-2002. At ASL Linick specialized in courses in literature, American and European, and in writing. He served as the sponsor of the school newspaper for fourteen years and of the student council for a dozen years and worked on a number of occasions with the school's program of out-of-classroom activities, Alternatives. Dorothy Linick coordinated this program for a number of years as well and also taught film studies at ASL. Earlier she had served as student services director at the American College in London. She died in 2007, leaving behind a great deal of unpublished fiction. With the collaboration of her sister, Naomi Goldstone Tschoegl, Linick was able in 2017 to include on his website Dorothy's novel, Sight / Bites. Author Following his retirement in 2002, Linick was able to pursue a number of additional interests and to devote more time to writing. The Linicks had purchased their first Miniature Schnauzer, Bertie, in 1983 and their third, Fritz, in 2003. Finding himself a part of a lively dog scene in the park across the street (Maida Vale's Paddington Recreation Ground), he began to keep a daily journal of the activities of these dogs and their owners in 2004 ‚Äì and in 2007 he published the first in a series entitled Life Among the Dog People of Paddington Rec. The series was still active as of 2015, earning its author an epithet as \\"The Pepys of Pups\\". In 2011 BBC Radio London, twice interviewed him on this project. Linick also completed a lengthy biography of his stepfather, The Lives of Ingolf Dahl, which was published in 2008. Working with Dahl's musical estate has been a long commitment. He wrote the liner notes for Michael Tilson Thomas' anthology recording, Defining Dahl in 1995, and in 2011 he was asked to update the Dahl entry in the Grove Dictionary of American Music.Published by Oxford University Press and available at Grove Music Online. Linick was also able to offer assistance to the musicologist Dorothy L. Crawford in her two books on the Los Angeles musical world. A second passion, one that traces back to the inspiration offered by Dahl to the young Linick and his school friends, was for the footpath.Linick (2009), pp.218-220. As early as 1974 Linick began a long series of walks on the extensive network of paths in England, the Channel Islands, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Here too he kept a detailed daily journal and these served as the source for A Walker's Alphabet: Adventures on the Long-distance footpaths of Great Britain (2010). After publishing four volumes in the Paddington Rec cycle, Linick decided in 2013 to offer subsequent editions on his own web site at www.anthonylinck.com. He also posted entries and photographs there covering the almost 5000 miles of walks he has completed in Britain and Ireland. Interests He lives in London and maintains his walking and park journals. He is a member of the South West Way and the Offa's Dyke Path Associations, the Rambler's Association, the Long Distance Walkers Association, and the National Trust, and he is a supporter of the Dogs Trust and a friend of both the Royal Academy and the Tate Gallery.

It is native to the Pacific Northwest, ranging from British Columbia to northern California. Description Ischnura erratica is a robust species with a length of and a wingspan of . In the male, the head is black with a green facial stripe and three blue spots on the forehead. The lower part of the eyes are green. The thorax is black dorsally and yellowish-green ventrally, with two lateral blue stripes. The abdomen is shiny black above and yellowish-green or yellowish-orange below. Segments 1 and 2 have blue bands dorsally, segments 3 to 6 have narrow yellow rings and there is a large blue dorsal patch stretching from segments 7 or 8 to segment 10. The tip of segment 10 is extended into an upward-pointing forked tail. The female has two colour phases. One is similar to the male but with duller eyes and greenish-blue replacing blue. The other has pale patches on the head, a greenish thorax, and a black abdomen with narrow green rings at the base of some segments. Immature females have dull orange patches on head and thorax. Distribution and habitat Ischnura erratica is native to the Pacific Northwest and is found in lowland and upland habitats in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and northern California. It breeds in a range of habitats including acid peat bogs, forest lakes, beaver dams, field ponds, ditches and the backwaters of cool streams. It only breeds in clear waters. In British Columbia, it is often associated with drooping woodreed (Cinna latifolia) in the submerged stems of which the eggs are laid. It also perches on lily pads, on rocks and logs and on the ground, with the tip of the abdomen resting on the surface. Behavior Ischnura erratica is one of the earliest damselflies to emerge each year. It is on the wing in British Columbia from the very end of April until June or even later, and in California from February to September. It has a rapid low flight and females are sometimes found at long distances from water. The tip of the abdomen may be bent down in flight. Males defend a small territory in a suitable breeding location beside water. They perch on emerging vegetation and engage in aerial circling with any encroaching male without contact actually being made. Several males may have overlapping territories. They also display by raising the blue tip of the abdomen. Copulation may last for an hour or more but the couple separate before egg-laying starts. The female lays the eggs individually in the stems of submerged water plants, sometimes with her whole abdomen under water.

People who work in flocking are at risk of inhaling small pieces of the flock fibers, which causes interstitial lung disease. The disease was initially described in 1998, when a group of workers at a flocking plant developed interstitial lung disease of unknown cause. Signs and symptoms Ground-glass opacity seen on CT caused by hypersensitivity pneumonitis, not flock worker's lung. This type of abnormality is commonly seen in flock worker's lung. Signs and symptoms of flock worker's lung include rales (crackling noises caused by fluid in the lungs), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and coughing. Abnormalities seen on a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs can include ground glass opacity and reticular opacity. The typical histopathology in flock worker's lung is bronchiolocentric interstitial pneumonitis and lymphocytic bronchiolitis with lymphocytic hyperplasia. Occasionally, desquamative interstitial pneumonia and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia can be seen. Other symptoms described in flock workers include pleuritic chest pain and atypical chest pain. Most cases described have been chronic and progressive. Lung function in individuals with flock worker's lung is generally diminished, with both restrictive and obstructive defects found. Causes  Scanning electron microscope image of airborne respirable dust sample collected in test chamber after agitating a bulk flock sample from a card manufacturing plant Flock worker's lung is caused by exposure to small pieces of flock, usually nylon, created during the flocking process and inhaled. Exposure to rotary-cut flock particulates is the main risk factor; whether or not other types of flock cause this pulmonary fibrosis is not yet determined. Other types of flock include rayon, polypropylene, and polyethylene. Workers exposed to nylon, polypropylene, polyethylene, and rayon flocking debris have developed flock worker's lung. Exposure to higher concentrations of respirable flock particles is associated with more severe disease. Whether or not smoking affects the progression or incidence of flock worker's lung is a topic of ongoing research as of 2015. Research in rats has shown that nylon flocking is a causative agent. Diagnosis A CT scan of the lungs and histopathology along with a history of working in the flocking industry can diagnose flock worker's lung. A differential diagnosis may also include Sj√∂gren's syndrome and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia. Flock worker's lung may be misdiagnosed as asthma or recurrent pneumonia. Though X-rays may be abnormal, CT scans are more useful as a diagnostic tool in flock worker's lung. Other diagnostic methods may include a transbronchial biopsy or wedge biopsy. Prevention Flock worker's lung can be prevented with engineering controls that protect workers from inhaling flock. Engineering controls to prevent inhalation of flock can include using guillotine cutters rather than rotary cutters, and ensuring that blades are sharp, since dull blades shear off more respirable particles. NIOSH-certified respirators can be worn to reduce the risk of inhalation when performing certain activities. Flocking plants have also implemented medical surveillance programs for workers to diagnose cases at an earlier stage. Another technique for preventing flock worker's lung is cleaning the workplace with alternatives to compressed air in order to avoid resuspending particulates in the air. Treatment  Flock worker's lung is generally treated by removing the individual from the environment where they are inhaling flock. Symptoms generally improve within days to weeks after stopping exposure. The benefits of glucocorticoid therapy are unclear. Prognosis Flock worker's lung may raise the risk for lung cancer, but the connection is a topic of research as of 2015. The disease can be subacute or develop over long periods of exposure.  Epidemiology  Cases have been reported in the United States, Canada, Turkey, and Spain. History Interstitial lung disease in flock workers was first connected to flock fibers in 1991, though the disease now known as \\"flock worker's lung\\" was not formally described until 1998, when researchers from NIOSH published the results of an epidemiological investigation of outbreaks in Ontario and Rhode Island. Previously, interstitial lung disease in flock workers was incorrectly attributed to mycotoxins present in contaminated adhesive. As of June 1999, 24 flock workers had been diagnosed.

An emancipated slave, he emigrated to Liberia in 1830 and engaged in a string of adventures, most notably thwarting an attack on the Heddington mission by an army of Loma tribesmen in 1840. He later served in Liberia's House of Representatives.Durwood Dunn, An Abolitionist in the Appalachian South (University of Tennessee Press (1997), pp. 33‚Äì34. Biography Harris was born in Knox County, Tennessee, in 1811. Little is known of his early life, though he would later state in a conversation with abolitionist Ezekiel Birdseye that he had been a slave. He eventually obtained his freedom, and commenced working as a carpenter. In February 1830, he arrived in Liberia with several other colonists, including George W. Erskine, a Presbyterian missionary who had been trained for the ministry by Isaac Anderson at the Southern and Western Theological Seminary (modern Maryville College). Erskine and several members of his family died shortly after their arrival.\\"Brig Liberia's Company, Arrived at Monrovia February 17, 1830\\", 1830. Retrieved March 25, 2015.

Brown at Heddington, a remote Methodist mission from Monrovia, when a band of 300 to 400 tribesmen led by the Loma chief Gotorah attacked. Having stockpiled muskets, Harris, with help from only his wife, an assistant carpenter, and Brown, managed to fend off the entire attack.\\"The Attack on Heddington,\\" African Repository and Colonial Journal, Vol. 16, No. 13 (July 1840), p. 194.\\"Information Wanted\\", Maryland Colonization Journal, Vol. 1, No. 7 (December 1841), p. 102.

Its first unabridged version appeared in March 1919, in Vladimir Mayakovsky's Collected Works 1909-1919. The poem deals with the themes of passionate love hurled down to the feet of a woman who still prefers safe haven of domesticity and social status provided by her successful husband, vengeful God's cruelty, death and suicide. Background Lilya and Osip Briks In July 1915 Mayakovsky for the first time met husband and wife Osip and Lilya Briks at their dacha in Malakhovka nearby Moscow. Soon the latter's sister Elsa invited him to the Briks' Petrograd flat. There Mayakovsky recited the yet unpublished poem A Cloud in Trousers and announced it as dedicated to the hostess. \\"That was the happiest day in my life,\\" he wrote in his autobiography I, Myself years later. Described variously as \\"one of the most exciting women of her times,\\" or a cynical manipulator who \\"could be mournful, seductive, capricious, haughty, vacant, fickle, passionate, intelligent ‚Äì whichever you wanted her,\\" according to Viktor Shklovsky, Lilya found herself the unwilling object of the poet's all-consuming passion. \\"For two and a half years I didn't have a moment's peace. I understood right away that Volodya was a genius, but I didn't like him. I didn't like clamorous people ... I didn't like the fact that he was so tall and people in the street would stare at him; I was annoyed that he enjoyed listening to his own voice, I couldn't even stand the name Mayakovsky... sounding so much like a cheap pen name,\\" she claimed in her memoirs. Nevertheless, not only did Lilya respond to this \\"assault\\" benevolently, her husband too has got infatuated with Mayakovskty's artistic persona so as to leave his career of a successful lawyer and businessman behind and submerge himself totally both into the poet's publishing affairs and the Futurists movement. Still, as a mere part of a love triangle, Mayakovsky at the early stage of these complicated relationships felt humiliated and vexed by Lilya's unwillingness to give herself to him unreservedly, preferring instead to cling to her well-placed, financially reliable husband. These emotionally overcharged frustrations have translated into an epic diatribe against cruel God and the modern world where true love gets destroyed by moral conventions and economic interests. History Maxim Gorky who was one of the first to recognize Mayakovsky as a big poet proved to be the only champion of the Backbone Flute Backbone Flute was written in the autumn of 1915, soon after Mayakovsky, now unwilling to fight in the War, accepted his new friend Maxim Gorky's help and joined the Petrograd military automobile driving school. The poem was completed in November, originally called Verses for Her (–°—Ç–∏—Ö–∏ –µ–π, Stikhi ei). In December of that year, it appeared in Vzyal (–í–∑—è–ª, Took) almanac, severely cut (with lines 35‚Äì36, 69-75 missing) and in February 1916 was released as a book by Vzyal Publishers, with even more censorial interventions: also gone were lines 17‚Äì20, 76‚Äì81, 88‚Äì94, 114-121 and 178‚Äì185, as well as every single mention of \\"God\\" and \\"the Almighty\\". The poem's full text appeared for the first time in the Vladimir Mayakovsky's Collected Works 1909-1919 collection where it was titled The Backbone's Flute (–§–ª–µ–π—Ç–∞ –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–Ω–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫–∞). The poem could be seen as a sequel to its predecessor, according to biographer A.Mikhaylov. Both were autobiographical and shared the common leitmotif, that of love being killed by the social conventions and bourgeois morality. As A Cloud in Trousers several months earlier, Backbone Flute outraged most of the contemporary Russian critics, some of whom referred to the author as a talentless charlatan, spurning \\"empty words of a malaria sufferer,\\" others as a psychically unstable man \\"who should be hospitalized immediately.\\" The only major Russian author to praise the poem was Maxim Gorky. B.Yurkovsky, who knew Gorky and his family well, has left such an entry in his diary: \\"Alexey Maximovich has gone totally mad about Mayakovsky lately; he considers him to be [Russia's] biggest poet of today, certainly the most gifted one. His Backbone Flute poem he is just raving about. Never tired of praising Mayakovsky's grandiosity and uniqueness, speaks of how there's no more Futurism now as such, only Mayakovsky stands alone, Russia's greatest poet.\\" \\"This indeed is... the very essence of the Universal poetry, a lyric of the world's spinal chord,\\" Gorky reportedly said, commenting on the poem's title. Synopsis The poet rises his \\"skull filled with verses,\\" starting what he anticipates to be his \\"final concert\\" before finishing his life with \\"a bullet for a dot.\\". He curses his beloved (wondering \\"what heavenly Hoffmann might have invented you, the vile one\\"), then blames God for bringing to Earth this woman, a devil in disguise. Visiting her at home, he implores Lilya to leave her ageing husband, then, horrified by her aloof coldness, threatens again to kill himself, now by drowning. He sees his love as something more horrible than the World War, yet threatens to haunt the woman he loves forever. Her husband returns home in surprisingly good moods, which the poets tries to spoil by advising him to \\"hang loads of pearls upon her neck\\" so as to keep her by his side. Eventually, ignored by everybody, he recognizes himself as a failed Messiah, \\"crucified on paper, with words for nails.\\"Backbone Flute. The Works by Vladimir Mayakovsky in 6 volumes.

For example, a species of plant may come in two varieties: one which prefers wetter soil and one which prefers dryer soil. During a period of wet years, the wet variety will be more fit and produce more offspring, and thereby increase the frequency of wet-preferring plants. If this wet period is followed by drought, the dry variety will be selected for and its numbers will increase. As periods of dryness and wetness fluctuate, so too does selection on dry-preferring and wet-preferring plants. Fluctuating selection is also manifest at the genic level. Consider two alleles, A and B, which are found at the same locus. Fluctuating selection dynamics are at play when selection favors A at time t0, B at t1 and A again at t2. Fluctuating selection has been characterized by several mathematical models. Under some circumstances, fluctuating selection may lead to a balanced polymorphism. When two species exert selection on one another, e.g. a host and its parasite, this can lead to fluctuating selection dynamics. Red Queen dynamics and the maintenance of sex The Red Queen hypothesis describes coevolutionary 'arms races' between antagonistic species (predators and prey, parasites and hosts, competitors with overlapping niches), emphasizing competition between species and populations rather than within them. Under Red Queen dynamics, a species must adapt to shifting selection pressures of the ever-changing biota which constitute its environment or face extinction. Experiments in Red Queen environments on real and simulated populations have offered strong support for the maintenance of sexual reproduction despite the two-fold cost of sex. Fluctuating selection may also play an important role in host-parasite coevolutionary relationships, specifically in the maintenance of sex. It has been shown that coevolutionary arms race dynamics between host and parasite give way to fluctuating selection dynamics in a minimal environment. Fluctuating selection in Red Queen environments has been suggested as an explanation for the persistence of sex: > The essence of sex in our theory is that it stores genes that are currently > bad but have promise for reuse. It continually tries them in combination, > waiting for the time when the focus of disadvantage has moved elsewhere. > When this has happened, the genotypes carrying such genes spread by > successful reproduction, becoming simultaneously stores for other bad genes > and thus onward in continuous succession. In this conception of sex, the population is a storehouse of variation and sex is a mechanism for distributing old, minority variants once they become useful. This theory depends on fluctuating selection, as fluctuating selection dynamics make adaptive previously maladaptive variants due to ecological shifts.

It is a bushy shrub with profuse cream, yellow or greenish flowers and overlapping leaves on the youngest shoots.  Description  Melaleuca densa grows to a height of about and has fibrous, grey or almost white bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately or often in threes around the stem, each leaf long and wide, oval shaped to almost circular but tapering to a soft point. The yellow or cream coloured flowers are in heads or spikes at the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering. Each head has between 15 and 37 individual flowers, making a group up to long and in diameter. At the base of each flower there are brown, papery, overlapping bracts which fall off as the flowers develop. The stamens are arranged in 5 bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 3 to 6 stamens. Flowering occurs from August to September but sometimes continues to December. The fruit are woody capsules long with the sepals remaining as rounded teeth. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1812 by Robert Brown in Hortus Kewensis. The reason Brown chose the specific epithet (densa) is not known but it is from the Latin densus, meaning \\"dense\\", and may refer to the density of the leaves or of the flowers in the inflorescence. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca densa occurs from the Stirling Range to Augusta in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions. It grows sandy or clayey soils in seasonally wet flats, in swamps and on riverbanks. Conservation status Melaleuca densa is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Ashmore et al. for the use of Bryant, was a freedom suit by former slave Anthony Bryant on behalf of his family in Coles County, Illinois. It is noted for the unusual circumstance where Abraham Lincoln, the future emancipator of slaves, defended a slave- owner against a slave. The case pitted Lincoln and former Illinois Attorney General Usher F. Linder against former US Representative Orlando B. Ficklin. Ficklin's case proved successful, and Bryant's family was emancipated based on free soil doctrine. Background Kentucky native Robert Matson purchased land in Coles County, Illinois in 1836. Matson skirted the state laws that banned slavery by bringing slaves for only a year, returning them to Kentucky, and then replacing them with new slaves. Matson emancipated one of his slaves, Anthony Bryant, who acted as his foreman. Bryant's family joined him in Coles County in 1845. Two years later, there was an altercation between Bryant's wife, Jane, and one of Matson's white housekeepers. After the housekeeper threatened Bryant's family, Matson sent one of Bryant's children back to Kentucky. Concerned about his family, Bryant and his family sought refuge with two local abolitionists, Hiram Rutherford and Gideon Ashmore. Since the rest of his family was still enslaved, this violated state fugitive slave laws. Matson sought to recover the family and enlisted the help of former Illinois Attorney General Usher F. Linder. Linder had recently joined the Whig Party, where he befriended fellow lawyer Abraham Lincoln. Like Lincoln, Linder opposed slavery. He was able to convince a local justice of the peace to imprison the Bryant family in the fall. Trial Abraham Lincoln c. 1846, around the time of the trial The ensuing court case, in re Bryant, opened in October 1847. Ashmore and Rutherford requested the legal assistance of Lincoln, but found that Lincoln had already agreed to work with Linder to defend Matson. After learning about the request, Linder gave Lincoln permission to instead represent the abolitionists, but Rutherford refused. The abolitionists, on behalf of Bryant, instead enlisted the help of former US Representative Orlando B. Ficklin against Linder and Lincoln. Lincoln had previously won a freedom suit (Bailey v. Cromwell (1841)) on behalf of an alleged slave, Nance, and her children, successfully getting the Illinois Supreme Court to declare, \\"the presumption [is] . . . every person was free, without regard to race . . . the sale of a free person is illegal.\\" During the Matson proceedings, Lincoln conceded that slaves were free, when brought to settle permanently in Illinois but argued that Matson intended to house the Bryants temporarily and thus they were covered by an exception for slaves in transit. He also provided evidence supporting the character of Matson. Ficklin defended the Bryants by arguing that any man in a free state becomes free. The Coles County judge sided with Ficklin noting that the Bryants' two-year tenure in Illinois exceeded any possible transit exception, and the case ended with the Bryants' freedom. Aftermath Matson left Illinois, refusing to pay his lawyers. The Bryants later resettled in Liberia. Similar arguments to Lincoln's were used by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney in the Dred Scott v. Sandford decision. The case remains a controversial event in the development of Lincoln's views on slavery. Lincoln may have taken the case because of recent financial troubles. He may also have defended Matson knowing that he could not win, or perhaps because he did believe that Matson's legal rights were being violated.

The war activities on the island began in October 1827. The Fabvier asked the Committee to arrange to exclude the Turks, who were in the castle of the island, the sea not to refuel, but they were busy organizing health and other authorities and report expenses. In January 1828 when he came Ioannis Kapodistrias in Greece, Fabvier sent letter requesting aid supplies and money. Kapodistrias, although he knew that the campaign in Chios was unfortunate, he sent all possible aid because they did not want to risk the lives of the inhabitants. But the Committee of Chios had stopped regularly pays his soldiers and did their ammunition as agreed. Regular and irregular troops grumbling. On February 28, 1928 was landing some 3000 Turkish soldiers on the island and many of the residents together with representatives of the Committee of Chios on the island fled. That evening Fabvier implemented plan for withdrawal from the island. The Committee announced that it had come Andreas Vokos Miaoulis with the frigate \\"Hellas\\" and other ships which had clear Turkish and asked him to return. The Fabvier agreed.

It collects, preserves, processes and makes available archival materials documenting the historical development of Prague since the Middle Ages up to the present. Together with the National Archives of the Czech Republic the Prague City Archives is one of the largest and most important archives in Bohemia. History Staircase of Clam-Gallas Palace in the Old Town of Prague, which serves as the venue for cultural events of the Archives The Prague City Archives was founded as an independent specialized institution in 1851. Since that time it was located on the ground floor of the Old Town Hall. During the fire of the Old Town Hall on 8 May 1945, a part of the archive was destroyed, but fortunately the majority of the historical documents were evacuated outside Prague. After the end of the war the archives were housed in the Clam-Gallas Palace in the Old Town of Prague. The palace was soon unable to accommodate the wealth of material, therefore the archives were housed in eight different buildings, some of them were located outside Prague. The new archive building was built in 1997 in the Prague district of Chodov. The Clam- Gallas Palace serves today as venue for cultural event and conferences organized by the Prague City Archives. Archival collections The archive currently administers 19,000 meters in length of archive material and 3,000 meters of books, newspapers and magazines. The collection of manuscripts contains 8,427 official books relating to the four medieval Prague towns and several hundred literary, religious and scientific or academic manuscripts. It has a collection of over 200,000 parchments and paper documents. The archives has also a large library containing over 150,000 oriented chiefly towards the history of Prague and its present-day life. The oldest document kept in the archives is the so-called Bohnice Authentica from 1158.

When they arrive, a park ranger tells them the trail Alex wanted to take is closed and suggests they hike elsewhere; Alex refuses a map, confident that he knows the park well. After a canoe trip down river, Alex injures his foot. Night falls and they set up camp. During dinner, they encounter a tour guide called Brad (Eric Balfour) who flirts with Jen, which irritates Alex. Brad implies he would be more suited to take Jen on a hike. Though Alex and Jen initially planned on not hiking far, the next morning Alex decides to go off-trail, deeper into the park where Alex remembers there is a lake with a waterfall. On the way, he spots a bear paw print but does not tell Jen. The pair also discover a mauled, half-devoured deer. When they finally arrive at where Alex believes the lake is, they discover it is not and he realises he is lost. Jen looks for her cell phone but Alex reveals he removed it from her backpack and put it in the car, concerned that it would distract her.

Jen lashes out at him, revealing that she never wanted to come on the trip. Alex reveals he was bringing her to the lake to propose. They make camp and Jen apologises, then the two tend to Alex's injured bloody foot, which has unknowingly been attracting predators. During the night as the pair sleep, a bear approaches the camp and sniffs the tent. Later that morning, they find that all of their food has been eaten. As they continue hiking they come across a bear bed, realising they are in dangerous territory, and decide to walk as far as possible before it gets dark. The next morning, Alex awakens to see the bear a few metres from the tent and getting closer. The bear claws through the tent and claws Jen on the arm. Alex, trying to protect her, is attacked too. Jen briefly wards the bear off with bear spray but it returns and drags Alex out of the tent, and begins eating him alive. Jen flees. Now without any food or shelter, Jen sleeps in a tree and wakes up to the sound of a helicopter overhead, but fails to get its attention. Stalked again by the bear, Jen manages to escape it by climbing down the waterfall, but she slips and breaks her ankle. Using a makeshift splint, she limps through the park at night using her road flare as a guide. After collapsing against a tree, suffering from her wounds, she awakes to see a deer grazing in front of her, motivating her to continue. Miraculously, Jen makes it back to their canoe. Paddling back to the lodge, she collapses on the beach in sight of Brad, who is getting ready to lead a tour, and he races over to help her.

Biography Jefrem Jankoviƒá was born in around 1640. His tombstone epitaph tells of him as being \\"a Serb [...] from the Serbian city of Skopje\\". As an archdeacon, he served at the Patriarchate of Peƒá under Patriarch Maksim I (s. 1655‚Äì1674). During the office of Patriarch Arsenije III (s. 1674‚Äì1690), Jefrem was ordained a priest. Jankoviƒá was appointed the bishop of the Eparchy of Polog (otherwise known as Eparchy of Tetovo, hence his byname), an eparchy under jurisdiction of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá. During the Great Turkish War (1683‚Äì99), in the event known as the Great Serbian Migration, Jankoviƒá and his countrymen feared Ottoman reprisal so they joined the Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III Crnojeviƒá and fled northwards into the Kingdom of Hungary, all the way to Szentendre, which the Patriarch made his new home. There, Jefrem was appointed in 1694 as the Orthodox bishop of Mohacs and Sziget, an important post because of the need to fight off aggressive Catholic propaganda.

These form a separate branch of the Order from the Cistercian monks of the Strict Observance, most commonly known as Trappists. This abbey was the first monastery of the Order to be established in the United States. The community was closed in 2011. History In the years following World War I, at the instigation of the Abbot General of the Order, the project was conceived of establishing the first monastery of the Order in the United States. While originally envisioned as a foundation of Wettingen- Mehrerau Abbey in Austria, eventually monks from several Cistercian monasteries in Austria, Holland and Switzerland volunteered to undertake the endeavor. In looking for a place to build their monastery, the monks received an invitation from Sebastian Gebhard Messmer, the Swiss-born Archbishop of Milwaukee, to establish themselves there. Arriving in 1928, the monks settled in Oconomowoc, a suburb of Milwaukee. There they founded the Monastery of Our Lady of Spring Bank, following the ancient Cistercian practice of dedicating their monasteries to the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of the locale in which they live. At first the community operated under the direct oversight of the Abbot General himself, but responsibility for this was soon transferred to Hauterive Abbey in Switzerland. The monastery began to flourish and was soon raised to the status of an independent abbey. Following World War II, the abbey became a place of refuge for Cistercian monks from Eastern Europe, especially for those from Zirc Abbey in Hungary, which was closed by Communist authorities in 1950. These monks eventually found a home in Texas, where they established the Abbey of Our Lady of Dallas. In 1985 the monastic community made the decision to relocate in an effort to find a setting more conducive to their lives of contemplation than the city in which they lived for nearly six decades. They settled upon the town of Sparta, Wisconsin, where they acquired some 600 acres of land, which was divided into forest lands and agricultural tracts leased to local farmers. A new monastery was built which would be able to accommodate 20 monks. Membership in the community, however, stayed around half that for much of the subsequent era. Like most monasteries, Spring Bank Abbey struggled to find ways to support itself. Under the leadership of an administrative prior, Bernard McCoy, O.Cist., who came into office around A.D. 2000, the abbey launched a discount printing and toner operation, known as LaserMonks. Profits from this endeavor reached into the millions of dollars and McCoy became widely known in the business world and the media, both for his business success and as a face of compassionate entrepreneurism, flying around the country to give talks in a donated airplane. As a result of a number of factors, by 2010 profits from these enterprises had begun to diminish severely and the business was closed the following year. Whether from this or from other factors, the decision was made in 2011 by the monastic chapter to dissolve the abbey.

Design and development A Caudron C.27 in Turkish service When it was shown at the 1922 Paris Salon, the C.27 was presented as the second in a triplet of increasingly demanding trainers, starting with the Caudron G.3 and ending with the more powerful Caudron C.59, though Hauet describes it as a basic trainer. It was a two bay biplane, without stagger or significant dihedral. It had rectangular plan wings, each built around two wooden spars and fabric covered. These were braced with parallel interplane struts, assisted by piano-wire bracing. There were simple parallel cabane struts between the upper wing centre section and the upper fuselage longerons. Ailerons were fitted only to the upper wing. The C.27 was powered by an Le Rh√¥ne 9C nine cylinder air-cooled rotary engine, driving a two blade propeller and with a cowling which surrounded its upper three- quarters. Behind the engine the fuselage had a cross-braced beam structure. The open cockpits were in tandem between the wings, the pupil's slightly forward of mid-chord and the instructor's close behind under the trailing edge, which had a rounded cut-out to improve his vision. At the rear a long, shallow triangular fin carried a straight edged balanced rudder which reached down to the keel. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and the elevators were cut away centrally to allow rudder movement. The C.27 had a fixed tail skid undercarriage with its wheels on a single axle supported by two pairs of V-struts from the lower fuselage. The forward members of these were originally double with a shock absorber in their upper parts, together with an elaborately wire braced central skid to prevent nose-overs, but the skid was soon abandoned and the double struts replaced by single ones. At least one C.27 flew with a Anzani engine. The name C.27 was used to at least mid-1924 but at the Paris Salon L'A√©rophile noted that the designation had changed to C.127. From 1925 several were fitted with Clerget 9B nine cylinder rotary engines and designated C.125. The C.128 was again very similar but powered by a Salmson 9AC, a nine-cylinder, air cooled radial engine. This had a smaller diameter than the rotaries and was mounted in a tapered nose with its cylinders exposed. There was a 14% increase in empty weight from the C.127 and a slight increase in span and area. At least five were built or converted. At least twenty-one C.27, C.125, C.127 and C.128 aircraft appeared on the French civil register. Operational history The exact date of the first flight, piloted by Boulard, is not known but the aircraft was flown publicly at Orly at the end of June 1922. It was piloted by Thoret, who particularly impressed onlookers with a polished aerobatic performance, the last part with his engine off. Two years later a C.27 piloted by Patin won the 1924 Zenith Cup, a trophy based on fuel consumption and load carrying ability, and Adrienne Bolland set a women's record in another C.27 when she completed 212 consecutive loops. A C.128 came second in the 1926 Zenith Cup and in September 1927 one carried five people to win a competition at a rally in Auvergne. In September 1927 a C.128 won a prize by carrying five people. In September 1928 pilots Mauler and Baud, with cameraman Cohendy set out on a flight, made in stages of about from Paris to the Cape of Good Hope via the West African coast. The flight was organised by Le Peit Paisien newspaper and by Paramount films, for whom Cohendy recorded their journey their journey. It was the first flight from France to the Cape. They then flew back to Paris after a round trip of about . In 1930 a modified C.128, ordered by the Soci√©t√© Pour le D√©veloppement de l'Aviation (Society for the development of aviation) and designated C.128/2 was equipped to allow an acrobat to hang on a trapeze under the aircraft and also to permit wing-walking. Variants ;C.27: Original aircraft with Le Rh√¥ne 9C. Anzani engines were also fitted. ;C.125: As C.27/127 but with Clerget 9B engine. ;C.127: Original type redesignated with only minor changes, same Le Rh√¥ne 9C engine. ;C.128Caudron C.128 photo from L'A√©rophile, January 1926: As C.27/127 but with Salmson 9AC engine and greater span.

The Dean (Jim Rash) announces that he has bought a virtual reality (VR) system for the school and Jeff (Joel McHale) and Frankie (Paget Brewster) join him as he sets it up. The Dean is shocked and overwhelmed by the system, despite its aged graphics. After Britta discovers that a new sofa in Abed and Annie's apartment was delivered to the name \\"Perry\\", she works out that her parents secretly ordered it. Abed, Annie and Jeff have been taking money from her parents for years in order to buy things for her or lend her money. They find her parents lovely and do not understand her animosity towards them. Britta approaches her parents, trying to give them a cheque for all the money they have covertly given her, which is postdated by a year so that she can leave all her friends behind and earn the money she owes by then. She storms out when she finds Annie and Abed are over to visit, and steals a child's minibike to ride away on. Frankie finds Britta in the backseat of her car and they discuss their parents. Frankie and Britta visit Britta's parents, and she apologizes to them. Chang arrives with a massively swollen hand, having been unable to find the nurse. Meanwhile, Frankie tries to get the Dean to find the serial number of the VR system from within its interface, which involves retrieving a file from an inordinately-sized filing cabinet. However, he realizes that she is trying to return the system for a refund and destroys the file by plunging it into a fountain. Jeff is sent to the company's headquarters, a recreational vehicle (RV) in which he argues with the system's creator Elroy Patashnik over its uselessness. The next day, Elroy arrives at the Dean's office and tells him that the system is a waste of time. The Dean has refused to leave the VR world and does not want to give it back. Elroy enters the system and overpowers the Dean, giving the school a refund. The Dean and Jeff thank Elroy, who now feels purposeless after admitting the futility of his products, and the Dean gives him $500 for his use of the technology before reminding him that he could enroll at Greendale. The end tag is a trailer for a spoof of the 1984 comedy horror film Gremlins in Portuguese, which Abed and Annie have purchased. Release The episode premiered on March 17, 2015, along with the season premiere \\"Ladders\\". In May 2015, a clip in which the Gremlins end tag actors discuss the making of the tag was released by The A.V. Club. Analysis The episode introduces Elroy Patashnik as a main character; the other new main character of the season, Frankie Dart, was introduced in the premiere. The virtual reality storyline parodies the 1992 science-fiction movie The Lawnmower Man. Emily VanDerWerff of Vox found that the episode was about \\"how impossible it is to actually grow up\\" and highlighted a quote of Britta's as representative of the episode's theme and the show more generally: \\"It doesn't matter how mature we are or what resentments we carry. All that matters is that we're all going to die!\\" The show ends with a spoof of Gremlins. Joshua Alston commented that season six end tags became lengthier and more independent, perhaps as Yahoo! Screen allowed varying episode lengths in comparison to a broadcast channel. Reception Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 8 out of 10, but found it less strong than the season premiere. Goldman praised the story revelations involving Britta's parents and found the Dean's plot amusing, though criticized Chang's re-occurrence with a swollen hand throughout the episode. Joshua Alston of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B‚Äì rating, similarly criticizing the usage of Chang and praising Britta's storyline. However, Alston found the virtual reality storyline too lengthy. Collider Evan Valentine also found the episode weaker than the previous, believing each storyline to be mixed in terms of humor, but lauded the end tag. David Sims of The Atlantic praised David's acting and found the parody of The Lawnmower Man \\"strangely apt\\" for Yahoo! Screen, saying that the episode gave \\"renewed emphasis on the cinematic inventiveness and strangely sentimental core\\" of the show's earlier style.

The painting, a piece of official art during the Third Republic, shows a meeting of the painting jury of the Salon, the official exhibition of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, in 1883. The picture shows a room on the first floor of the Palais de l'Industrie. Shown in it are several identifiable artists of the time, including F√©lix- Joseph Barrias, Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant, L√©on Bonnat, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Alexandre Cabanel, Carolus-Duran, Gustave Achille Guillaumet and Antoine Vollon, who are involved in judging the works of art shown. In the latter half of the 19th century the Salon was an important and popular institution. The French state would acquire some of the paintings shown in the salon's exhibition, which would be hung in the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. The painting was exhibited in the Salon in 1885 and was subsequently acquired by Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, who later became the Prime Minister of France. Waldeck-Rousseau gave the painting to the Mus√©e du Luxembourg in 1892. It subsequently spent time in the Louvre and the Saint-Denis Museum, Reims, before being assigned to the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris, in 1981, where it is still held, .

(October 19, 1896 - December 16, 1945), was an attorney, civic leader, and Democratic politician from Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana. Background Hall was born in Mansfield, the seat of government of DeSoto Parish located south of Shreveport, the youngest of four children of Judge William Pike Hall (1851-1928), a native of Iredell County in west central North Carolina. Judge Hall presided over DeSoto and Red River parishes. The judge's first wife and Pike's mother, Lillian Ida Jack (1862-1898) of Natchitoches, died when young Pike was two years of age. The judge then married the former Elise Tally (died 1954), and they are interred together at Greenwood Cemetery in Shreveport. Hall was a maternal nephew of Judge George W. Jack of the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana and a cousin of Shreveport attorneys Whitfield Jack and Wellborn Jack, the latter a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for Caddo Parish from 1940 to 1964. Career In 1900, Hall moved to Shreveport, where he was in time educated at Methodist-affiliated Centenary College and thereafter the University of the South at Sewanee, Tennessee, Tulane University Law School in New Orleans, and the Columbia Law School in New York City. In 1922, he received his Bachelor of Laws degree from Columbia and was admitted that year to the Louisiana bar. He was affiliated with Kappa Alpha Order social fraternity and the legal fraternity, Phi Delta Phi. In 1917 and 1918, Hall was a private with the United States Army ambulance corps in France. He was a captain in the Judge Advocate General's Corps during World War II but was discharged for a physical disability. He sat on the local Selective Service Board. He was affiliated with the veterans organizations, the Forty and Eight, American Legion, and Veterans of Foreign Wars. He was affiliated with the Masonic lodge, the Shriners, and the Shreveport Chamber of Commerce. He served on the executive committee of the Louisiana Civil Service League. He was a member of the Shreveport Country Club and The Boston Club of New Orleans. He was a member of the First Methodist Church of Shreveport. From 1924 to 1932, Hall represented Caddo and DeSoto parishes in the Louisiana State Senate during the administrations of Governors Henry Fuqua, Oramel H. Simpson, and Huey Pierce Long Jr. One of his Senate successors was the Shreveport attorney Cecil Morgan, a leader of the anti-Long forces in the chamber. Hall was a partner in the Shreveport law firm of Foster, Hall, and Smith; he was also active in the Louisiana Law Institute and at all levels of the bar association, including the presidency of the organization in 1940 and 1941. In 1925, Hall married the former Hazel Tucker, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. C. M. Tucker of Haughton in southeastern Bossier Parish. The couple had two children, Hazel, later Hazel Schaffer, and Pike Hall Jr., a subsequent judge who at the time of his father's death was attending C. E. Byrd High School in Shreveport. Hall died in a Shreveport sanitarium at the age of forty-nine from complications of a cerebral stroke. He is interred at Forest Park East Cemetery in Shreveport.

Hoff was an ex- boxer who later became a bootlegger and gambler.  Early life  Max Hoff was born in Little Italy, Philadelphia, in 1892 to poor Russian Jewish immigrants. After quitting school, Hoff worked for many years in a cigar store where the service also included gambling. His pay was raised from $12 a week to $15 after his boss noticed how his amiable personality appealed to customers. In 1917, he started a gambling operation in the section of Philadelphia now known as Society Hill.  Boxing  In the late 1920s, he had the largest stable of prizefighters in the nation, and he staged boxing matches for many years at several Philadelphia sites. None of his boxers won a world championship, but several were highly ranked contenders in a period when boxing was a widely popular form of sports entertainment. In 1928, his stable of boxers became Max Hoff Inc. His group was the first group of prize fighters to be incorporated. In 1927, Hoff filed a $350,000 lawsuit against Gene Tunney and his manager, Billy Gibson. The suit was based on a disputed agreement, which Hoff claimed was signed by Tunney and Gibson the day before Tunney's first fight with the heavyweight champion, Jack Dempsey, in 1926. He said he loaned Tunney and Gibson $20,000 as an advance to bind an oral agreement. Tunney and Gibson claimed they needed money right away because they owed thousands of dollars to Tex Rickards, who promoted the fight and had loaned them money to cover training and other expenses. The deal called for Hoff to receive 20% of Tunney's championship fight earnings and to be joint-manager, with Gibson, in exchange for the loan. For unknown reasons, Hoff dropped the suit in 1931, despite his insistence that he had a strong case.  Prohibition  When Prohibition took effect in 1919, Hoff expanded his business into bootlegging; just like most mobsters in Philadelphia including Mickey Duffy, Leo and Ignatius Lanzetta, and Salvatore Sabella. Hoff's bootlegging operation included an office with 175 phones and a weekly payroll of $30,000. Illegal booze manufacturing and distribution operations were netting Hoff's syndicate an estimated $5 million yearly by the late 1920s. Hoff became one of the richest gangsters in the United States. He hosted luxurious parties, where stars of the sports and entertainment worlds partied with his accomplices. In 1929, Hoff attended the Atlantic City Conference, which was hosted by corrupt Atlantic County treasurer Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Johnson and headed by Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano and Johnny Torrio. The meeting took place at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel after new Jewish Mob boss Meyer Lansky's wedding in Atlantic City, New Jersey. At the conference, the two men discussed the future of organized crime and the future structure of the Mafia crime families. Other attendees included: Lansky and Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel (The Bugs and Meyer Mob), Frank Costello (a member of the Masseria crime family), Abe Bernstein (The Purple Gang), Alphonse \\"Scarface\\" Capone (boss of Chicago's South Side Gang), Abner Zwillman (Newark crime boss), and Dutch Schultz (New York and Newark numbers rackets).Sifakis, Carl (2005). The Mafia Encyclopedia. New York: Da Capo Press.  Investigation  Hoff was called to the stand eight times during a Grand Jury investigation along with 748 other witnesses who testified. Even though he denied to being a part of the bootlegging empires in Philadelphia, Philadelphia District Attorney John Monaghan nicknamed him the \\"King of Philadelphia's Bootleggers\\". Despite the great amount of evidence stacked against him, Hoff was never indicted during the trials, because (according to a New York Times reporter) Hoff \\"had scrupulously avoided signing any documents connected to the undercover operations\\". A few details that were revealed during the investigation: Hoff and his accomplices set up the Franklin Mortgage and Investment Company to front for several industrial alcohol companies they took over and operated. In a three-month-period, 350,000 gallons of bootlegged alcohol were transported from the Publicker plant in Little Italy by the Reading Railroad in large oil drums marked \\"tar\\" or \\"asphaltum,\\" to one of the alcohol companies under the syndicate's control. After the alcohol was processed, it was placed in bottles and labeled as \\"hair oil\\" or \\"perfume\\". Hoff's association with the Union Bank and Trust Company gave him the ability to finance the bootleg syndicate via a $10 million money- laundering plan. Normal banking procedures were bypassed, allowing him to open fourteen accounts, using the names of dead people or just fake names. The bank's president was forced to resign after it was determined that he had served as the fake owner of several blocks of Atlantic City real estate, worth millions of dollars, which were bought by Hoff and his associates. To ensure the delivery of booze to brothels, bars and restaurants, members of the Philadelphia Police Department were paid off by bootleggers and speakeasy owners. It was estimated that the bribes paid to cops by bar owners totaled $2 million a year. Of the 87 officers questioned, many of them were fired or resigned because they couldn't explain such increases in their bank accounts and real estate and stock holdings. The owner of Military Sales Company, Edward S. Goldberg, admitted that he sold machine guns and bulletproof vests to Hoff. During one raid, about 450 machine guns were discovered in the I Goldberg store basement in Philadelphia. In 1929, the New York City Police Department complained that most of their confiscated guns were bought in Philadelphia. The $500,000 worth of European liquor and champagne seized in a raid on a barge near Mount Holly, New Jersey was traced back to Hoff's gang.  Bad times  After Prohibition was repealed in 1933, Hoff's luck began to run out. The IRS sued Hoff for $21,000 in unpaid income taxes; in which his home in Cobbs Creek Park was sold by the sheriff for $1,200 and his car was sold for $240. Hoff was arrested in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station for allegedly attempting to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. Bad luck forced Hoff to sell his last entertainment venture, an ice cream shop called the Village Barn, near the University of Pennsylvania campus.  Death  His body was found on April 27, 1941, by his second wife, Margaret. The autopsy showed the cause of death as a heart ailment.

Hogenesch (born May 29, 1967) is an American chronobiologist and Professor of Pediatrics at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. The primary focus of his work has been studying the network of mammalian clock genes from the genomic and computational perspective to further the understanding of circadian behavior. He is currently the Deputy Director of the Center for Chronobiology, an Ohio Eminent Scholar, and Professor of Pediatrics in the Divisions of Perinatal Biology and Immunobiology at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Personal life Family Hogenesch was born on May 29, 1967, in Rotterdam, Netherlands. He was raised in Gainesville, Florida, by his father Thieo E. Hogen-Esch and his mother Cheryl H. St. George. His parents both work at the University of Southern California. His father is a polymer chemist, and his mother is a clinical instructor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences. His brother, Tom Hogen-Esch is a Political Science and Urban Studies professor at Cal State Northridge. Education Hogenesch originally received a B.A. in History from the University of Southern California in 1989 followed by a B.S. in Biology in 1991. He was inspired to study chronobiology by Joseph Takahashi in the fall of 1992 after learning about the Drosophila clock in a lecture. In 1999 Hogenesch completed a Ph.D. in Neuroscience at Northwestern University's Chicago campus, studying transcription factors with basic helix-loop-helix (BHLH) and PAS protein domains. Hogenesh was mentored by Chris Bradfield, now a professor of oncology and the Director of the Molecular and Environmental Toxicology Graduate Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He continued his research on functional genomics as a postdoctoral researcher with Dr. Steve A. Kay at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation. Career Discovery of BMAL1 In March, 1997, Hogenesch was a neuroscience graduate student at Northwestern University in the laboratory of Christopher Bradfield, when he discovered five transcription factors in the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) domain superfamily during his thesis work. These transcription factors were initially named MOP1-5. Hogenesch‚Äôs later characterization of MOP3, better known as BMAL1 or ARNTL, revealed in 1998 that its role as a partner of the bHLH-PAS transcription factor CLOCK was essential to the function of the mammalian circadian clock. BMAL1 and CLOCK are now the two most well recognized bHLH-PAS domain transcription factors. Later work revealed that Bmal1 is the only clock gene without which the circadian clock fails to function in humans. BMAL1 functions as a positive element in the circadian clock. It forms a heterodimer with CLOCK to initiate transcription of target genes that contain E-box sequences, such as Period and Cryptochrome in mice. The BMAL1:CLOCK complex is suppressed by the buildup of the PER:CRY heterodimers. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1999, Hogenesch followed his Ph.D. mentor Christopher Bradfield to the University of Wisconsin-Madison and continued in his lab as a postdoctoral associate. During this time, Hogenesch focused on following up on his Ph.D. work. Assembling & mRNA characterization of complete mammalian transcriptomes  Later in 1999, he became a postdoctoral associate with Steve A. Kay and Peter G. Schultz. Kay was employed by the University of California at San Diego and the Scripps Research Institute, while Schultz was employed at the Scripps Research Institute and was founder and director of The Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) in La Jolla, CA. Hogenesch started work on the human transcriptome and the mRNA characterization of the transcriptomes of humans, mice, and rats, which he would later continue as Director of Genomics at GNF. Hogenesch became the Program Manager of Genomics at GNF in 2000, and remained there until 2004. During his time there, he accomplished the compilation of the complete human transcriptome, and also the mRNA characterization of the human, mouse, and rat transcriptomes. These highly cited works, together cited over 3700 times, have been influential in the field of genome biology. Hogenesch then brought together his work on the human and mouse transcriptomes into a gene atlas, which he made available as a tool for other genome biologists.  Characterizing circadian regulation of transcription  In addition to characterizing transciptomes present in various organisms, Hogenesch has also spent time throughout his career determining which genes were regulated on a circadian schedule. Working with his colleagues he has determined that mRNA in plants, flies, mice, and humans all shows extensive circadian regulation. In mammals up to 43% of all genes are regulated according to a circadian clock. Transcription for circadianly regulated mRNA shows regular peaks in morning and evening, which then has implications for the regulation of drug targets. Non-coding RNA and functional genomics In 2004 Hogenesch left California to become a professor and the Director of Genome Technology at The Scripps Research Institute's other location in West Palm Beach, FL, where he continued his work on transcriptomes. Hogenesch contributed to a study published in 2005 which used new RNAi genetic screening techniques to discover a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) known as NRON. NRON, a repressor of the protein NFAT, is one of the first well characterized examples of a ncRNAs involved in transcription regulation. In 2006, Hogenesch moved to the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania where he continues to study mammalian circadian clocks and genome function. One of his current research directions includes incorporating research on noncoding RNA, such as siRNA or hairpin RNA isolated by combining forward genetics and genomic screens. He has used this technique on miRNA to examine signalling and cell survival. Contributions to the core clock mechanisms and the field of chronobiology Over the course of his career, Hogenesch has made numerous contributions to the understanding of the core clock mechanisms. He discovered the key proteins Bmal1 (Arntl), and Bmal2 early in his career. He was also on the team that discovered Rora to be an important regulator of Bmal1. Rora is currently under investigation for a possible connection to autism, which may relate to its function as a circadian regulator. Hogenesch has also contributed to the identification of hundreds more genes that modulate circadian rhythms in humans by using genome wide RNAi scanning. More recently, he discovered new clock gene CHRONO using novel computer based machine learning techniques to prioritize clock gene candidates. Hogenesch has also contributed to the field by mentored scientists like Satchin Panda and has collaborated with over 25 other scientists on a variety of papers that cover a range of topics including CREB signaling, NF-Œ∫B signaling, TRP channels, melanopsin signaling, cell type specific splicing, noncoding RNA function, and RNA-seq methods and mapping algorithms. Applications of scientific achievements  Wikipedia and chronobiology Hogenesh has pushed for the chronobiology community to create Wikipedia pages about genes through a project called Gene Wiki. The result has been the creation of pages about genes involved in the circadian clock such as ARNTL, as well as pages about chronobiologists like Ingeborg Beling. He has also been instrumental in creating the Gene Atlas. This project uses a database run by Hogenesch called the Circa database that lists time of activity of genes in different tissues. As an open source database, it allows biologists and pharmaceutical researchers to determine the peak time of different genes and mRNA which can then be used to target drug treatments.  Medicinal uses of chronobiology  In October 2014, Hogenesch's discovery that many proteins targeted by drugs experience circadian fluctuations made strides towards chronotherapy treatment. A future focus on the timing of drug administration will optimize drug efficacy by allowing physicians prescribe medicine to be taken when it is most effective.

Launched in 2012 with headquarters in Dallas, Texas, the firm has been featured in publications including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Men's Health, ESPN and MSNBC. Mizzen+Main has been endorsed by several professional athletes like Phil Mickelson and NFL player David Vobora, in exchange for a share in the company and additional payments. History Mizzen+Main was co- founded in 2012 by Kevin Lavelle who served as the company CEO until stepping down in April 2019. Chris Phillips, formerly head of men's clothing at Stitch Fix, became CEO of Mizzen+Main in April 2019. Lavelle,a graduate of Southern Methodist University, worked as a management consultant. The idea for the firm's signature product, a fabric performance dress shirt, originated in 2005 when he was in Washington D.C. as an intern. He has said that he noticed sweat stains on the shirt of a congressional staffer, leading to the idea of producing a moisture-wicking dress shirt similar to the capabilities of athletic clothing. He experimented with numerous fabrics, before finding a combination that became the first prototype. The company officially launched in July 2012. The firm was initially self-funded but later received an investment from several angel investors. It began by selling its products online and adding boutiques that carried the products in large stores. The brand made wholesale retail a part of its distribution strategy, partnering with men's specialty stores and golf pro shops. The initial offering included two dress shirt designs. In 2013, it caught the eye of executives from Saks Fifth Avenue, and was invited to be one of two pop-up stores inside of Saks' New York store as part of Super Bowl XLVIII weekend. In the summer of 2014, the firm raised an additional round of capital from a variety of investors,  Endorsements  In September 2015, Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt signed an endorsement deal with the company in return for an undisclosed equity share of the business. In July 2017, J.J. Watt and Mizzen+Main launched \\"The J.J.

Brandon (1908-1982) was a founding member of the New York Workers Film and Photo League. He later worked as a film distributor for Garrison Films before founding his own company, Brandon Films in November 1940. During the 1950s, Brandon Films owned the largest collection of 16mm available for general release in the United States. He was the first president of the New York Film Council, and helped to found the short-lived Film Forum in 1933 with Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Sidney Howard. In 1968, Brandon sold his company to Macmillan; the new entity became known as Audio-Brandon. His work in the 1970s to reclaim and publicize the history of 1930s film activism is an important source for film historians.

Between January 1955 and January 1965, he was successively the commander of Military Region 2 and head of the Ground Forces Command. His performance as commander of the losing side at the Battle of Lak Sao in early 1964, plus the loss of support from its political patron Major-General Phoumi Nosavan, led to Sang's resignation from command. Biography General Sang Kittirath was placed in command of Military Region 2Conboy, Morrison, p. 14. in January 1955. The deadline for the 1954 Geneva Agreement had expired, meaning that the Pathet Lao were supposed to hand over the control of Houaphanh Province and Xiangkhouang Province to the Royal Lao Government (RLG). Major Sang set up his forward headquarters in Moung Peun, which was the only RLG-occupied town in Houaphanh Province. He was assigned three battalions of government troops to enforce the return of the two provinces. However, he found himself facing eight defiant Pathet Lao battalions, probably backed by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's troops. The Pathet Lao besieged Moung Peun. In June 1955, an attempt was made at extending RLG influence by training irregular ADC militia units to operate to the north of Moung Peun, in Phongsali Province. In the first week of July, two battalions of reinforcements for Sang's forces were flown in from southern Laos. Also, the 1st Parachute Battalion (French: 1er Bataillon de Parachutistes - 1er BP) was dropped in, and one additional battalion had been recruited and trained in place. Moung Peun held, but the provinces remained held by the Pathet Lao. In October 1955, the two sides agreed to a buffer zone between them. By year's end, 3,000 Military Region 1 militia troops were raiding supply lines in Phongsali Province.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 16, 18. The stalemate at Moung Peun dragged on until the August 1956 agreement to integrate the Lao communists into the First Coalition Government. Another 15 months would pass while details were being worked out. Key to the coalition was the May 1958 national elections; the communists were running with their own candidates for office. The U.S. Embassy, which was supporting the Royalists, staged the Operation Booster Shot civic action program to attract votes for the Royalists, with little success. On 11 May, two battalions of Pathet Lao troops were supposed to be merged into the Royal Lao Army (RLA). One battalion stalled, then bolted on 18 May 1958. In the wake of their escape, Sang was removed from command of , Morrison, pp. 18‚Äì19. When Major- General Phoumi Nosavan's coup took over the nation in December 1959, Sang was one of the generals who supported him.Conboy, Morrison, p. 25. In March 1961, Phoumi formed several regimental units by gathering RLA's battalions. He created the Ground Forces Command to oversee the new regiments, and appointed General Sang to that position.Conboy, Morrison, p. 52. In November 1963, Sang was again entrusted with a field command. He directed a composite force of RLA and Neutralist troops in the unsuccessful Battle of Lak Sao.Conboy, Morrison, p. 101. He would remain a staunch Phoumi supporter until the end, which finally came in January 1965. When Phoumi's final coup failed, he fled into exile. With Phoumi gone, Sang was forced to resign his post as head the Ground Forces Command; the post was subsequently abolished.Conboy, Morrison, p. 125.

The Iowa State Guard was organized during World War II in order to replace the Iowa National Guard which was federalized as a result of the war. The Iowa State Guard is recognized as a part of the organized militia of Iowa. History In December 1941, Governor George A. Wilson ordered the organization of the Iowa State Guard. Former adjutant general of Iowa and World War I veteran, Lieutenant General Mathew A. Tinley, was assigned as the commanding officer of the Iowa State Guard. An officer corps and two regiments were organized. Each regiment consisted of 16 companies of 3 officers and 60 enlisted men, each, and a medical detachment of 5 officers and 30 enlisted men. The First Regiment was organized in the southern half of the state and the Second Regiment was organized in the northern half. A Military Police Battalion was also established. Members included those who were rejected from federal service due to medical conditions, workers given industrial exemptions from the draft, those above the drafting age, and those men who were waiting to be drafted. These guardsmen were trained at a basic training course which lasted thirteen weeks. The State Guard also assisted with several state emergencies, including a major fire in Dubuque, tornadoes in Sioux and Webster Counties and several western Iowa floods in 1943 and 1944. During the summer and fall of 1945, Iowa State Guard units were deployed to quell a riot at the State Training School for Boys at Eldora and maintain order in the aftermath. Disbandment With the reorganization of the Iowa National Guard in 1946 and 1947, the last units of the Iowa State Guard were deactivated on 17 September 1947. Other militias Other units of militia were able to organize and receive a charter as a Military Order of Guard from the state of Iowa. In 1935, because African-Americans were not allowed to serve in the Iowa National Guard, the aviator John C. Robinson requested and received from the state a charter to organize a collection of black pilots and mechanics as the Military Order of Guard, Aviation Squadron. A unit composed solely of women and girls was organized in 1943 in Davenport and consisted of roughly 150 members who received training in infantry drill, equitation, first aid, radio code, self-defense, scouting and patrolling from a captain in the Iowa State Guard. Both of these organizations operated parallel to the Iowa State Guard. They, along with the Iowa State Guard, served as components of the Iowa organized militia as volunteer paramilitary organizations under the authority of the state of Iowa. Legal status State defense forces are recognized by the federal government of the United States under Title 32, Section 109 of the United States Code. Iowa state law allows the Governor of Iowa to activate the Iowa State Guard when any part of the Iowa National Guard is called to active duty by the federal government of the United States.

The brigade was raised again, now known as 176th Infantry Brigade, shortly prior to the Second World War and fought in the Normandy Campaign before being disbanded in August 1944. In both world wars the brigade was assigned to a 59th Division: the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division during the first, and the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division in the second. First World War On 31 August 1914, 27 days after the British declaration of war on Germany, the War Office authorised the formation of 2nd Line units for all Territorial Force (TF) units that were being sent overseas. As a result, the 2/1st Staffordshire Brigade came into existence, as a duplicate of the 1/1st Staffordshire Brigade, which was part of the North Midland Division,http://www.1914-1918.net/46div.htm and was assigned to the 2nd North Midland Division. The brigade (and division) was formed mainly from those men in the Territorial Force who, when asked at the outbreak of war, did not volunteer for service overseas (as soldiers who joined the TF were not obligated to serve overseas). Like the 1st Line formation, the brigade was composed of two battalions of the South Staffordshire Regimenthttp://www.1914-1918.net/sstaffs.htm and two of the North Staffordshire Regiment.http://www.1914-1918.net/nstaffs.htm To distinguish the 2nd Line from the 1st Line, they adopted the '2/' prefix (so a 2nd Line battalion would become 2/5th North Staffs, for example, and a 1st Line 1/5th North Staffs).

As a result, in late January 1918, the 1/5th North Staffords was transferred from 137th (1/1st Staffordshire) Brigade of 46th (North Midland) Division where they amalgamated with the 2/5th Battalion and were renamed the 5th Battalion.https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/units/1715/north- staffordshire-regiment/ At the same time the 1/5th South Staffs was disbanded, most of the men going to other South Staffs battalions.https://www.forces-war- records.co.uk/units/321/south-staffordshire-regiment/ Second World War The brigade was disbanded after the war along with the rest of the Territorial Force, which was reformed as the Territorial Army in the 1920s but neither the brigade or division were reformed, being formed as a 2nd Line for hostilities- only.http://59div.morssweb.com/ Throughout the spring and summer of 1939 the Territorial Army was doubled in size as the threat of war with Germany was becoming increasingly likely. As a result, the brigade number was reactivated by the redesignation of the 166th Infantry BrigadeJoslen, p. 354. on 4 September 1939, the day after Britain and France declared war on Germany, thus beginning the Second World War. The 176th Infantry Brigade, composed of two battalions of the North Staffs and one of the South Staffs, was assigned to the 59th (Staffordshire) Motor Division, which was created as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 55th (West Lancashire) Motor Division. The division was originally organised as a motorised infantry division of only two brigades,Joslen, p. 93. the other being the 177th Infantry Brigade, which was formed as a 2nd Line duplicate of 176th Brigade. Unlike most Territorial divisions, which were split into an exact 2nd Line 'mirror' duplicate of their parent formation, the 59th, along with two other 2nd Line divisions (the 18th and the 45th), was instead split on a geographical basis, all the units from Staffordshire being assigned to the 59th Division and all units from Liverpool and Lancashire being assigned to the 55th. This came with a considerable downside, however, as it meant that while some units of both divisions could be considered to be trained (the 1st Line units), the other units (the 2nd Line units) were not and as there were 1st and 2nd Line units in both divisions they were both considered untrained.http://jameskitchenerheath5051929.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/the- troubled-rebirth-of-59th.html About a month after the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was evacuated from Dunkirk in May‚ÄìJune 1940, the 59th Division was reorganised from a motorised division into a standard infantry division, due to a perceived failure of the motorised divisions in the Battle of France, and received the 197th Infantry Brigade from the now disbanded 66th Infantry Division and the 59th Division was reorganised as a normal infantry division of three brigades. Together with most of the rest of the British Army after the events of France and Dunkirk, the division moved to North-East England where they came under command of X Corps and alternated between coastal defence and home service duties and training to repel a German invasion.http://59div.morssweb.com/?itin#map In June 1942 the brigade, with the rest of the 59th Division, was sent to Northern Ireland where they were to remain until March 1943,Joslen, p. 94. and came under command of British Troops Northern Ireland. Soon after arrival, they took part in numerous large- scale exercises with American troops of the U.S. Army stationed there, including the U.S. 1st Armored and U.S. 34th Infantry divisions,http://www.secondworldwarni.org/details.aspx?id=5&pagerecordid;=609 both of which were later to serve with distinction fighting on the Italian Front. Later in the year, in October, the 176th Brigade was reorganised slightly, with the 7th Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment being exchanged for the 7th Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment, which had previously served with 220th Brigade. The 7th Royal Norfolks was a 2nd Line Territorial unit created in 1939 around the same time as 176th Brigade and had seen service in France in 1940 with the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and had escaped with a mere 30 men, including a single officer.http://www.rnrm.org.uk/history/history_ww2.html After training for many years throughout the United Kingdom and nine months spent in Northern Ireland the brigade landed in France, together with the rest of the 59th Division, in late June 1944 as part of Operation Overlord and became part of the British Second Army. The brigade fought in the severe attritional battles to capture Caen, in particular during Operation Charnwood and the Second Battle of the Odon, also known as Operation Pomegranate. In early August, during the crossing of the River Orne in which the 176th Infantry Brigade, supported by Churchill tanks of 107 RAC of 34 Tank Brigade, played a major role (and earned praise from the GOC Major-General Lewis Lyne),Buckley, p.178. Captain David Auldjo Jamieson, son of Sir Archibald Jamieson, of the 7th Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment was awarded the Victoria Cross for his extreme bravery, leadership and calmness under fire and despite being wounded. His would be the first and only VC awarded to the brigade and the division throughout the war. He survived his injuries and remained in the Army after the war where he later achieved the rank of major.https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/10/guardianobituaries During the crossing, the brigade suffered heavy casualties, with 7th Royal Norfolks sustaining 42 killed, 111 wounded and 73 missing, for a total of 226 casualties,http://59div.morssweb.com/?borne 6th North Staffords had 76 casualties and 7th South Staffords lost its CO, Lieutenant Colonel J.G. Bullock, killed in action.http://59div.morssweb.com/?memo At this stage of the Second World War, however, the British Army (and, in general, the whole of the United Kingdom) was suffering from a severe shortage of manpower, specifically in the infantry where the majority of combat casualties fell.Hart, p. 44. By August 1944, the Army fighting in France had absorbed nearly all the available infantrymen still available in the United Kingdom.Hart, p. 49. Consequently, aside from transferring large numbers of RAF, RAF Regiment, Navy and Artillery personnel to be retrained as infantrymen (which to do so would take many months), the only way the Army could find sufficient replacements (aside from the aforementioned method) for battle casualties was by breaking up units in the field in order to bring other field units up to strength. As a result, the 59th (Staffordshire) Division, considered the most 'junior' infantry division of the British Second Army,Buckley, p. 178. was chosen by General Bernard Montgomery, 21st Army Group Commander, for disbandment. The brigade and division were both, therefore, broken up in late Augusthttp://59div.morssweb.com/?itin and the battalions broken up and sent to other British divisions in order to bring them up to strength.

The purpose of this organization was to help create relief for the Polish refugees that were in Western Europe and helping them immigrate to the western countries. History Reverend Monsignor Feliks Burant was a member of the Polish Roman Alliance, Polish Roman Catholic Union of America, the Polish Legion of American Veterans, and other such organizations. Cisek. Polish Refugees and the Polish American Immigration and Relief Committee. After the start of World War II and the involvement of America into the war, he then helped form a new organization with the help all of the positions that he had held within the Polish community. It was not until the year 1946 that he had come up with the idea of PAIRC to help the refugees. The first meeting help by Reverend Burant was held on December 1946, and they came up with these three basic goals for the organization. *To begin working within preexisting means to help Polish refugees find jobs and apartments, placing children in schools, and providing them clothing, medical care, English lessons, and professional training. *To obtain from the American Relief for Poland whatever financial aid is necessary to help. *To obtain patronage from the National Catholic Welfare Conference.Cisek. Polish Refugees and the Polish American Immigration and Relief Committee. PAIRC had received funds from various other organizations which lead up to around $66,500 in the months from February 1947 to October 1948. In the years from 1948-1949 they had received around $4,000 a month for helping the Polish immigrants. As this organization continued to grow they had sure that each Polish immigrant that entered received a hot meal and a bed to sleep in upon arrival. But with the number of people that were coming over they had proposed a new tactic of organizing professional courses to help ease any of the uncertainty of any of the new immigrants that came over. As a result, this strengthen the Polish ethnic group that was beginning to form in the United States. On February 6, 1951 an agreement was signed between the National Catholic Welfare Conference, the War Relief Services, and PAIRC; which was then called the American Commission for the Relief of Polish Immigrants. This allowed for the following procedures: *The American Commission for the Relief of Polish Immigrants is engaged in obtaining home and job assurances in the United States for displaced persons in Europe, the Polish soldiers in England, and Polish refugees and displaced persons eligible under the Displaced Persons Act. *Assurances of homes and jobs obtained by the American Commission for the Relief of Polish Immigrants, are submitted to War Relief Services for processing, and the American Personal of War Relief Services, NCWC in Europe, England, and other countries are responsible for selection and process. *Here in the United States the Commission assists War Relief Services, NCWC in the pier operation and with many welfare and relief activities in early adjustment period of displaced persons and refugees.Cisek. Polish Refugees and the Polish American Immigration and Relief Committee. This had set the PAIRC to become a real asset to immigration within the United States, as they were even approved by NCWC, and this partnership would continue until the 1990s.

An art club is an organization for artists and the community to engage and collaborate with each other in a shared space dedicated to art and culture. The Providence Art Club has studios, galleries, eateries, and a clubhouse in a \\"picturesque procession of historic houses,\\" which are across the street from the First Baptist Church in America.[1] The buildings occupied by the Providence Art Club include Brick House, Dodge House, Deacon Taylor House, and Fleur De Lys Studio. History The Providence Art Club, founded on February 19, 1880, is the third oldest continually operating art club in America, after the Philadelphia Sketch Club and New York's Salmagundi Club. It was the first art club in the United States to admit women as members.Ratcliffe, Christopher (11 March 2017). \\"Christopher Ratcliffe: The art of women's equality\\". The Providence Journal. Archived from the original on 12 March 2017. Retrieved 12 March 2017. The Brown brothers (benefactors and namesakes of Brown University), Nicholas, Joseph, John, and Moses, helped construct the buildings now used by the Providence Art Club. These buildings have served as the foundation for many renovations that have been implemented since the 1800s.Early Providence Art Club members, circa 1890. Sydney Burleigh sits at right.At the inception of the club, Providence was a flourishing industrial and port city which allowed the city to invest in cultural endeavors, like art. Painting and sculpture was developed as past- times by the mill owners and manufacturers of the day. The market for painting was first for portraiture to meet the demand by many wealthy patrons. As the artistic community expanded in Providence, scattered groups of artists opened studios primarily around the town center. Some of these artists had a professional positions at private art schools and some gave more informal lessons in their studios. After many years of discussion the difficulty of displaying their works, a small group of artists including Edward Mitchell Bannister, Charles Walter Stetson, Sydney Burleigh, George William Whitaker, and Rosa Peckham came together to form the Club. At their first meeting, they created a committee to draft the first constitution, chose temporary officers, and debated the space they would occupy. They also created a compact which is preserved, to this day, in the Club's safe. The first president of the Art Club was the locally prominent portrait artist James Sullivan Lincoln. The club's first woman president was Mabel May Woodward. Not much is known about founding member Rosa Peckham; she studied with William Rimmer in New York and Jules Joseph Lefebvre in Paris. She was among the first 30 American women to have her artwork exhibited at the Paris Salon. It is Rosa Peckham's notes, from while she was serving as secretary, that provide a detailed history of the inception of the Club. However, Peckham was only secretary for the first year of the Club and thereafter served briefly as Vice President and remained a member of the Club for most of her life. The first exhibition at the Club was on May 11th, 1880 and was considered a critical success with favorable reviews in a series of nine long articles in the Providence Journal. Within a year after the creation of the Club, it had attracted over two hundred members and had found a suitable gallery space, though it continually underwent expansion and renovation, especially in its first decade of existence. The Club quickly became a space for socializing as members played music, had lively conversations, and heard lectures about culture. After 1888, there was no admission charged to the general public to view the exhibitions. As time went on, the expenses for the exhibitions began to be paid out of the general Club fund and the gallery was opened all year long. In 1945, the Club revised its policy about taking a ten percent commission from the sale of artists' work and since then the artists have kept all revenue from the sales of their work. The Club insures exhibits of artists' work against fire and theft.  Women Artists and the Providence Art Club  The Providence Art Club was the first American art club to insure full and equal membership to women in its original charter. On February 19th, 1880, six women signed the Club's original compact: Katherine H. Austin, Etta Belcher, Harriet R. Chace, Lottie F. Dailey, Rosa F. Peckham, and Eleanor W. Talbot. Their inclusion as equal members to their male counterparts in the club was \\"unheard of in 1880.\\"Bert, Catherine Little; Grinnell, Nancy Whipple (2017). Making Her Mark: The Women Artists of the Providence Art Club, 1880. Blurb, Inc. A week after the signing, the group again met, at the home of Lottie Dailey, to adopt a constitution characterized by gender-neutral language. Three weeks after this, the group held a public gathering in the \\"Ladies Studio\\" to inaugurate the club and recruit new members. They recruited 112 members, including 48 women. These founding women and other early members of the Providence Art Club worked professionally as artists and educators, each with studios in Providence where they made their art, gave lessons to others, and held yearly exhibits. Despite the societal barriers that being a woman in the male-dominated art world presented, many of these women made a name for themselves in the profession, even achieving economic independence through selling their work.Journal, Alexander StevensSpecial to The. \\"Providence Art Club honors its female founders in 'Making Her Mark' exhibit\\". providencejournal.com. Retrieved 2019-12-09. As a result of their success, these female artists challenged the \\"discriminatory myths of their time,\\" namely that women making art was always simply a hobby, never a profession. They created a culture within which women could be empowered to challenge traditional gender stereotypes. The women of the Club used the Ladies' Board to integrate themselves into the daily functions of the club in a manner that was separate and distinct from the men, though sometimes admittedly unequal. If elected to the board, in their first year they handled receptions for openings, the sale of the works on display, and general overview of the workings of the club. In their second year, members would work on an independent project and in their third and final year they would serve as an officer. Ex-members would often continue to serve on Club committees. In the early 1990s, the autonomy of the Ladies' Board was dissolved as their responsibilities were diffused among all members of the Club and they were no longer excluded from traditional men's activities.  Rhode Island School of Design and the Providence Art Club  From the Providence Art Club's founding in 1880, most members viewed the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and the Providence Art Club as having a symbiotic relationship. The Providence Art Club rented offices from the Rhode Island Society for the Encouragement of Domestic Industry, just down the hall from RISD, and used RISD spaces for its first exhibit. Many Providence artists were involved with both RISD and the Providence Art Club. Sarah Doyle, Clifton Hall, and William Weeden, all RISD trustees, were early and active members of the Providence Art Club. George Whitaker, an artist at the Providence Art Club, was the first teacher of oil painting at RISD and George Porter, the head teacher at RISD, was a founding Providence Art Club member.Barrett, Dawn; Martinez, Andrew (2008). Infinite Radius: Founding Rhode Island School of Design. Providence, RI: Rhode Island School of Design. However, from the start the artists of Rhode Island believed that keeping the Rhode Island School of Design and the Providence Art Club separate was extremely important. George Porter submitted an early proposition to have the Providence Art Club rent rooms from RISD and institute dual membership between the two institutions, but this was voted down. It was artist John Nelson Arnold who most strongly argued for the independence of the Providence Art Club. He believed that it was paramount that the Providence Art Club have its own space in order to avoid the risk of being overshadowed and enveloped by RISD. Each institution took up compatible but distinct roles. RISD served as a training ground for artists, teaching art skills with an emphasis on employment. The Providence Art Club served as a space for the exhibition of professional artists, currying favor from art collectors and buyers. Both institutions, endorsed by Providence's wealthy social class, invigorated the art community.\\"Rhode Island School of Design Publishes First Historical Anthology\\". artdaily.cc. Retrieved 2019-12-09.  Present-Day Infrastructure of the Club   Tax Status  The Club has a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status that enables it to maintain its financial well-being. Their Endowment Fund, a repository of all non-designated gifts, provides annual dividends to cover the club's operating expenses as member dues do not fully cover these costs.  Organization  The Club is still largely overseen by the President although in the 1990s adopted a position for a professional manager to oversee the daily functions of the Club so that the President could be freed up from these administrative tasks. An Executive Committee meets once a week to discuss issues relevant to the function of the Club and the entire Board meets each month, on the second Thursday, to further continue these conversations which is followed by a dinner.  Exhibitions  The Club's collection comprises more than 500 works ranging from paintings to pieces of furniture. \\"Picture of the Month\\" is an exhibit over the fireplace in the Club's reading room that changes each month and the pieces are selected from either the Club's collection, a member's private collection, or a recent purchase. Exhibits are held every two to three weeks and usually consist of the works of three to four artists, two to three displaying in the Mays and Moite gallery and the other in the Dodge House gallery. Artist members of the Club can exhibit every two to three years. Each year an Artists' Forum is hosted with the subject being of interest to the artist members of the Club. More often, there are Artists' Nights that include demonstrations, lectures, and workshops relevant to the interests of members.  Library and Archive  When the Art Club began, Providence did not have many institutions dedicated to the collection and curation of books and periodicals on art. The Club decided to subscribe to a variety of these publications and the library committee collected and bound these materials. In 1963, the decision was made to donate many of these bound volumes to RISD and Roger Williams College to clear space for a new display case. At present, the Club is dedicated to curating a fine arts library which includes the works of members. There is a digital repository of these resources and a monthly newsletter sent out by the librarian to members about the resources available to them in the library. In 1969, a member of the Art Club named Marge Dalenius organized all of the records of the Club that had previously been scattered in scrapbooks and other repositories around the Club. In 1993, the Club gained an official archivist to ensure the longevity of the documents detailing the Club's history which have since been transferred to a digital repository.  Membership  The Providence Art Club welcomes new members who are interested in art and culture. After being accepted, members get to attend monthly social events, including dinners, artist panel discussions, lectures, art lessons, and music programs. The Club also has a culinary program, with multiple dining rooms each providing a unique dining experience. Lunch is served Monday through Friday in the Caf√© and is extremely popular among members. The Caf√© also hosts dinners on Saturday nights and special brunches and receptions. Members can also host private events for up to 300 members.How to Become a Member of the Providence Art Club. Providence Art Club, providenceartclub.org/how-to-become-a-member/ There are three levels of membership. Patron members enjoy all of these benefits, but can not exhibit their work. Arts Professional Members, who must submit a selection of their artwork in order to qualify, benefit from the status of Professional Member, but also cannot exhibit work. Finally, Exhibiting Artist Members, who submit a portfolio which is then voted on by the Arts Qualification Committee, are able to exhibit and sell their work in the Providence Art Club Galleries. If the Providence Art Club is closed, members are allowed reciprocal privileges from other clubs in the area, including the Brown Faculty Club, the Agawam Hunt, the Hope Club, the Rhode Island Country Club, and the Squantum Association. The Providence Art Club has also recently formed relationships with the Arts Club of Washington, Circolo della Caccia in Bologna, Italy, the Franklin Inn Club of Philadelphia, the National Arts Club, the Salmagundi Club of Manhattan, and the St. Botolph Club of Boston.

Biography Barker was in earlier life a merchant, shipowner, and shipmaster of London, probably the same who, in 1627, in partnership with Matthew Cradock, John Fowke (afterwards, in 1653, lord mayor), and others, obtained letters of marque for the Golden Cock, of 200 tons (7 March, 17 July 1627), which Barker commanded in the Mediterranean, and in which, in the course of 1629, he recaptured a Venetian vessel from a Turkish corsair in the neighbourhood of Zante. The grand signor demanded and enforced satisfaction from the Levant Company, at whose instance Barker was thrown in prison, and so kept for more than a year (September 1630). His affairs after this do not seem to have prospered; and whilst his former partner, John Fowke, advanced to be alderman and lord mayor, he was still a shipmaster, and on 12 April 1652, when war with the Dutch Republic was imminent, he hired his ship, the Prosperous, of 600 tons and 44 guns, to the state, as a man-of-war, himself remaining in command. It does not, however, appear that the Prosperous was with Blake in the engagement off Folkestone on 19 May; but from the general gathering of ships which immediately followed, we may feel certain that she was with him in his cruise to the northward, when he captured or dispersed the Dutch herring fleet. In September she went to Denmark, as part of the squadron under Captain Ball, and narrowly escaped being lost at the same time as the Antelope. On her return to England, towards the end of October, she was sent into the river to refit, and was still there when the battle was fought off Dungeness on 30 November. In the stern remodelling of the navy which took place after this defeat, Barker was confirmed as captain of the Prosperous, and was present with the fleet off Portland on 18 Feb. 1652‚Äì3. From his relations with Ball during the previous summer, it is probable that the Prosperous formed part of the red division, under Blake's immediate command; it is, at any rate, certain that she was in the very thick of the battle; was engaged by several ships at once, led on by De Ruyter in person; and that, after a brilliant defence, Barker and a great part of the crew were killed, the rest wounded or overpowered, and the ship taken possession of. Her men were hastily transferred to De Ruyter's own ship, and a prize-crew put on board the Prosperous, which before nightfall was won back by the English; but the men remained prisoners, and were not released for some months. A gratuity of 400l. was assigned to Barker's widow, and the command of the Prosperous, whilst in the state's service, was given to his son William, who had himself been badly wounded when his father was killed.

It is also known as Cleveland No.1 Cemetery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2009.  History  Centred on Cleveland, the area which was to later become Redland Shire was one of the earliest areas in Queensland to be opened to free settlement following the closure of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement in 1842. Its location on the shores of Moreton Bay saw substantial efforts to establish Cleveland as the official port for the Moreton Bay District. Cleveland was declared as a township in December 1850. The first land sales took place in 1851. The earliest European settlers in the area had interests in pastoralism, business and shipping. A site for the first cemetery in Cleveland was surveyed by H. Rawnsley in December 1858 on a site bounded by Wellington, Queen, Russell and Smith Streets, within section 83, Parish of Cleveland. Seven separate sections were surveyed for various denominations including Church of England, Presbyterians, Wesleyans, Roman Catholics, Jews, and \\"Various Denominations\\". By 1864 the population of the Cleveland Township was 145, with the main occupations being labourer, farmer and timber-getter. The cemetery was used until 1873 when it was deemed to be unsuitable due to the \\"swampy nature of the soil\\". Section 112 immediately across Wellington Street to the west was gazetted as the new cemetery. There are 11 identified burials in the Pioneer Cemetery in the 15 years between its establishment in 1858 and its replacement in 1873, including: * Bridget Clary, d.2 May 1860, Child * Emily (Amelia) Hobbs, d. 28 July 1860 * Arthur Sidney Lyon, d. 22 October 1861, Journalist, Editor * William Henry Sherrin, d. 11 November 1864, Child * George Sherrin, d. 9 February 1865 - Robert HAMILTON, d. 11 April 1869 * Henry Bottomley, Unknown dates, Carpenter * John Dawson, Unknown dates * J. Neale, Unknown dates, Fisherman * William Rae, Unknown dates, Publican, Brighton Hotel, Cleveland * Andrew Whelan, Unknown dates, Blacksmith Systematic historical research into individual burials has not been undertaken. The exact number of burials at the cemetery remains unknown. It is also unknown whether any burials were removed and re- interred at the Cleveland No.2 Cemetery. The most prominent of the known individuals buried in the cemetery is Arthur Sidney Lyon, who died in Cleveland on 22 October 1861 (QRG 1861). Note that he is incorrectly recorded on memorial stone and interpretation signage at the cemetery as Sydney Arthur Lyons. Lyon established the Moreton Bay Courier with partner James Swan with its first edition released on 20 June 1846. The Moreton Bay Courier later became The Courier-Mail. Lyon apparently resigned as editor in December of the following year following arguments with his partner, however he is still listed as the publisher for the newspaper until its purchase by Theophilus Pugh in May 1861. Lyon went on to establish and run the Moreton Bay Free Press from 1849 to 1855, the North Australian in Ipswich from 1855 to 1858, followed by the Darling Downs Gazette from 1858, presumably until his death in 1861. By 1903, the original section 83 had been divided into four lots of around five acres each. The 1903 survey plan of the cemetery identifies a surveyed rectangular area within the cemetery reserve area containing 23 lines, possibly indicating graves. It is uncertain whether these markings represent the actual number of graves visible at the time of survey or whether they indicate a general acknowledgement of the presence of graves. In October 1905 land in Section 83 was offered for sale except the cemetery which was withheld from auction because of its previous use. Cleveland Shire Council objected to the sale of the land \\"on the grounds that several people have been buried therein and that it was once used for a cemetery. Unless absolutely necessary, a reserve of this description should never be alienated\\". The council objected again to the lease of the land in 1924, and raised the issue again in 1937. A cemetery reserve was finally gazetted as R1436 on 11 September 1937 with access provided from Queen Street. A memorial with the names of ten persons interred in the cemetery was erected at the site by teacher Merv Beitz from Cleveland State School as a practical history exercise for his class. The plaque on the memorial was supplied by Redland Shire Council. When the memorial was erected there were no headstones or other grave markers at the site.  Description  The Cleveland Pioneer Cemetery constitutes Scott Street Park and a vehicular access track running north-south to the park from Queen Street. The entire area is grassed with numerous large shade trees, consisting mainly of eucalypt species. No headstones or obvious signs of grave plots remain visible. A mound, approximately three metres wide runs south along the vehicular track from Queen Street and angles from the northwest to southeast across the identified cemetery reserve towards the playground located in the southeast quadrant of the park. The mound is approximately high at its apex and is likely related to the installation of services such as water into or through the park. A playground area is also located within the park and measures approximately . It is delineated by concrete edging and filled with sandy loam to approximately depth below the current ground surface. The installation and use of the playground equipment is unlikely to have caused major subsurface disturbance. There is a bench and a water tap situated adjacent to the north of the playground area, and timber bollards used to delineate the park area. None of the modern elements installed in the park are of archaeological importance. Adjacent to Lisa Street is a memorial plaque commemorating the early burials in the cemetery. The plaque is installed on a white concrete base and is surrounded by a white timber picket fence approx high. The inscription on the plaque consists of lead letters and reads: Cleveland Pioneer Cemetery, memorial plaque, 2006 > IN MEMORY OF SOME 25 PIONEERS RESTING HERE. > SYDNEY A. LYONS. 1816-61. FATHER OF QLD PRESS. > J. NEALE. FISHERMAN. WILLIAM RAE. PUBLICAN. > JOHN DAWSON. ANDREW WHELAN. BLACKSMITH. > ROBERT HAMILTON. BRIDGET CLAREY. CHILD. > HENRY BOTTOMLEY.

An interpretative sign is installed adjacent to the memorial stone at the Lisa Street access to the park.  Heritage listing  Cleveland Pioneer Cemetery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The Cleveland Pioneer Cemetery is an important aspect of Queensland's history being the site of the first cemetery established on the mainland in Redlands, one of the first areas opened up to free settlement in southeast Queensland. The cemetery is important historically as the burial site of Arthur Sidney Lyon (1861) who was known as \\"The Father of the Queensland Press\\". Lyon established the Moreton Bay Courier, amongst other early newspapers. The importance of the cemetery to the community was memorialised in 1975 through the installation of a memorial stone identifying those known to have been buried at the Pioneer cemetery. The presence of interpretive signage demonstrates a continuing community association with the place. The Cleveland Pioneer Cemetery has the potential to provide new and important information that will contribute to our understanding of the early history and demography of settlement in the Redlands region. Archaeological investigations at the site have potential to reveal subsurface evidence of the actual location and number of burials in the cemetery. Such investigation may answer important research questions about the organisation and layout of the cemetery and how this differed from the original plans. Archaeological investigations also have the potential to reveal information about whether graves were later moved to the nearby (and later) Cleveland No.2 Cemetery. Additional archaeological investigations have potential to contribute to the comparative analysis of burial practices across Queensland and through time. Important research questions can be formulated about the actual burial practices in early satellite settlements and regional communities. Archaeological investigations at the site have potential provide important information about social structures within an important and early European settlement in Queensland's history. Social structure will be expressed through the pattern of burials and layout of the cemetery.

During the period of her settlement work, Schoenfeld became interested in recreation for working girls, a subject on which she became a recognized authority. Her investigation of public dance halls in New York City, undertaken in 1908 while she was secretary of the Committee on the Amusement Resources of Working Girls, was the basis for the model New York City ordinance regulating dance halls. Later, as secretary of the Playground and Recreation Association of America (now known as the National Recreation and Park Association), she conducted dance hall investigations in Boston, Massachusetts, St. Joseph, Missouri, Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Early years and education Schoenfeld was born in Bellaire, Ohio, of German-Jewish parentage. Her father was born in Germany and migrated when a very young man to the US. Her mother was born in Frederick, Maryland, the daughter of German parents. When Schoenfeld was a few months old, her parents moved to Columbus, Ohio, and engaged in mercantile enterprises, before the family moved to Meadville, Pennsylvania, which was chosen for their home on account of its educational advantages. It was a college town with musical schools, where children could be given opportunities at a small cost. Schoenfeld was graduated from the public schools of Meadville and entered Allegheny College in 1804, being graduated in 1897. She decided to study medicine and entered the Woman's Medical College at Toronto, Canada, but with her father's objections to her being a professional woman, she gave up her work. Career While at school in Toronto, the family moved to Johnstown, Pennsylvania. On Schoenfeld's return, she was asked to assist with a settlement in the Jewish district in Pittsburgh and was requested to undertake the establishment of it. Though only 21 years of age, she offered her services to those interested in the movement and helped develop the Columbian Council School and Settlement. After three years' residence at the settlement, Schoenfeld left on account of ill health and returned to Johnstown in 1902. She then organized the Civic Club of Johnstown. The first work this club undertook was the establishment of the Juvenile Court and Schoenfeld, during the first year, served as volunteer probation officer. She also helped in the establishment of vacation schools and playgrounds. Her successor at the Columbian settlement remained but a year and she was again called to serve in the work in Pittsburgh, where she remained a year. Later an opportunity offered to study vacation and amusement resources of working girls in New York City. In 1908, Schoenfeld left for New York and as a result of her work there, New York passed legislation in regard to licensing and regulating dancing academies and public amusement parks. In 1911, Schoenfeld received a master's degree from Columbia University. She studied immigration and its relation to the protection of girls in the US, and as secretary of the committee on immigrant aid of the Council of Jewish Women, she developed the protective bureau for girls. Irene Kaufmann Settlement After three years as secretary of the Playground and Recreation Association, she was appointed head worker of the Irene Kauffman Settlement in Pittsburgh. She had worked there previously; 14 years agom when it was called the Columbian Council Settlement, she was the first head resident. She visited many cities, studying the philanthropic and social work. She attended many conferences in the US and abroad. While in London in 1907, she made a close study of the Toynbee Hall and University Settlement. She was an active worker on the state committee and state confederation of Women's Clubs, also in the Consumers' League and with other state and national organizations for the improvement of working conditions among women and children. She has written many articles for the press and addressed many of the prominent clubs of the country. She is considered in her time to be one of the prominent women in the philanthropic work of the US.

The central library building at 225 Washington Street opened in 1900 and was constructed in a Renaissance style with private donations including a large donation from John Nicholas Brown I, and a large addition was built in 1954. The Library is different from most city libraries because it is governed by a board of trustees and funded privately but serves the public. The Providence Public Library was awarded the National Medal for Museum and Library Service in 2001, for outstanding service to their community.  History  In June 1871, representatives from The Franklin Society, the Rhode Island Society for the Encouragement of Domestic Industry, The Franklin Lyceum, and the Association of Mechanics and Manufacturers met to form a Free Public Library, Art Gallery, and a Museum of Natural History, combining their private libraries.The library first opened in February, 1878, on the second floor of the former Butler Exchange building at now Kennedy Plaza, and purchased a location at Snow Street, just two years later. In 1896, the library broke ground on the current location at Washington Street, with a gift of $268,500 by John Nicholas Brown I, paying more than half the final cost of $387,000. Brown died just six weeks after the library opened March 1900. Opening with 93,000 volumes, the collection has since grown to over 1.4 million. The library began the biggest library renovation in state history in 2019 at a cost of $25 million to renovate the Empire Street addition which was originally built in 1954.  Collections  The Providence Public Library is home to many specialty collections including World War I and II propaganda, Irish culture and literature, art, architecture, and more. The library also actively collects local historical items, such as maps, charts, newspapers, photographs, and family and neighborhood histories directly relating to Providence, and Rhode Island. An extensive collection of whaling and maritime items features 800 voyage log books, 550 blueprints and technical drawings, and 11 scale ship models created by Alfred S. Brownell who donated the collection in the 1950s. The Caleb C. Harris Collection on the Civil War and Slavery, purchased in 1884, is the library's largest collection featuring over 10,000 books, pamphlets, manuscripts, ephemera, newspapers from the 18th century relating to slavery. Items include a large collection of translations of Uncle Tom's Cabin, and letters written home by Rhode Island soldiers during the Civil War. The Updike Collection of printing started in 1910, with the encouragement and contribution of Daniel Berkeley Updike, the founder of Merrymount Press. The collection has grown to over 7,500 volumes, 600 letters, hundreds of prints, and type specimen books dating to the 16th century. The collection also contains three printing presses, punches and a type set. Recently, as part of initiatives to make local collections more accessible, Brown University students and faculty helped brainstorm new approaches to community archives. In a course in Digital Public Humanities taught by Jim McGrath, students did ‚Äúresearch and development work that was hard to fit into‚Äù the schedules of the Providence Public Library Special Collections team. While also working with the Updike Collection, the students focused on the Lou Costa Collection and the AS220 Collection.Jim McGrath, ‚ÄúTeaching Digital Public Humanities with the Public Library,‚Äù in, Smulyan, Susan.

He married Marija Krejƒçi in 1910, with whom he had four children; Breda Milƒçinski Slodnjak (1911‚Äì2001), Janez Milƒçinski (1913‚Äì1993), Frane Milƒçinski ‚Äì Je≈æek (1914‚Äì1988) and Lev Milƒçinski (1916‚Äì2001). He assumed the position of councillor in the Provincial High Court in Ljubljana. Two years later he was nominated for councillor for the Table of the Seven in Zagreb, Croatia. He worked as a lawyer even after retiring in 1925. He made an occasional appearance on Ljubljana's radio as a story teller in 1928. He died in Ljubljana. Works Milƒçinski was a humorist, satirist, young adult fiction writer and playwright. He started writing as a student. He was published by Rogaƒç, Slovenski Narod, and Slovenec. His first humorous sketch stories were published in collections Igraƒçke (1909) and Muhoborci (1912). In these works he ridicules the Slovene petty bourgeoisie and makes fun of bureaucracy, along with the political and cultural situations in which he himself grew up. His books Tolovaj Mataj and Ptiƒçki brez gnezda were published in 1917, and Gospodiƒçna Mici in 1930 in which he remarks upon the misconducts in family education, and warns about child neglect. Between wars he published humorous and satirical stories under the alias Fridolin ≈Ωolna. In these satirical sketch stories he describes actual events. His most famous collection of humorous stories is ' (1949); the stories were published posthumously in the monthly magazine ≈Ωika, the youth paper Na≈° rod and in the storybook Tolovaj Mataj. Many of his works were published posthumously (Zgodbe skavta Petra, Humoreske in groteske). He wrote numerous fantasy short stories, in which he took on the ancient story motive of the Slovene folk song (' (1911), ' (1917)). Besides those, he also wrote plays (Brat sokol, Cigani, Kjer ljubezen, tam Bog, Krapn mlaj≈°i). The plays Volka≈°in (1913) and Mogoƒçni prstan's (1923) target audience was primarily the youth. In ≈Ωivljenjepis mojega peresa (\\"Biography of My Quill\\") Milƒçinski wrote that he drew inspiration from his favorite writers such as Dostoyevsky, Dickens and Twain. Although Milƒçinski was born in a time of naturalism and realism, he was active during the early 20th century Slovenian contemporary period as well. Either way, he cannot be marked as an archetypical representative of either literary genre. The genre title that suits him best is a humorist writer.

It stars Green as a fictionalized version of himself who, in the process of making a documentary about monsters, is contacted by a man, played by Ray Wise, who insists that he can prove monsters are real.  Plot  Filmmaker Adam Green begins a documentary about artwork that features monsters. Green is surprised when William Dekker, a retired detective, contacts him and claims to have proof of the existence of monsters. Green's wife reacts skeptically, but he reworks his documentary to focus on Dekker and his efforts to expose the monsters' underground home, which he calls \\"The Marrow\\". Green interviews Dekker at his house, who claims that he has seen many monsters and identified some of them through sketches. Dekker mentions his son once but diverts from the topic when Green inquires. The shooting crew of Green and his cameraman wait at the Marrow's entrance; a dug-up hole in the cemetery in the woods. On the first night they do not see anything although Dekker keeps claiming that he could see one of the monsters. Next time they do capture a footage of a monster for a brief time interval, but there is a disbelief as to whether it is a hoax setup by Dekker. Then they make an arrangement of five cameras and light to capture footage in the absence of their cameraman. One of the cameras, Camera-2, goes missing. Other cameras capture monsters, and later reveals that Dekker visits often and communicates, or feeds, one of the monsters at the Marrow. However the footage is not very clear. Meanwhile, Green finds out that Dekker had approached other directors with his story and the Boston police department do not recognize him. This arouses suspicion and Green tries to gather more footage to confirm hoax (or reality) at the Marrow one night with his cameraman. Dekker arrives there too, and soon they are violently attacked by monsters. They escape in their car. Green and his cameraman leaves the house. Next morning they find that Dekker has abandoned the house and they couldn't trace him. However, there is a room with broken chains, implying a monster had been trapped there. Dekker probably believes that one of the monsters is his son and used to trap him there. The movie ends with footage from camera-2 showing a monster that keeps Dekker trapped in a cage, and attacks Green at his home.  Cast  * Adam Green as himself * Ray Wise as William Dekker * Will Barratt as himself * Alex Pardee as himself * Rileah Vanderbilt as herself  Production  The initial concept for the film came from fan mail sent by Alex Pardee that purported to tell the true history of a character Green had created, Victor Crowley. Green was taken with the mail and wanted to interview the author, but he could not interest anyone else in the project, as they were worried that the fan could turn out to be unbalanced. The project further coalesced when Green met Pardee at a convention. Pardee, an artist, shared his story Digging Up the Marrow, in which an artist is commissioned to paint purportedly real monsters. Green then combined the two ideas. Casting for Dekker was difficult for the filmmakers, because they were not sure whether they should use an unknown or a famous actor. Ultimately, they decided that it would be too distracting for audiences to suddenly be taken out of the film when real monsters were introduced. As a result, Wise was cast so that it would be obvious from the start that the film was not an attempted hoax. Though Wise's casting was initially controversial among people to whom Green showed a work print, they came around to his point of view when he explained the reasoning. Of casting himself, Green said that it grounded the film and made the events seem more real. When writing the script, Green wanted to make sure that the in-jokes did not impact on the enjoyment of general audiences unfamiliar with his work. Green said that they were added bonuses for fans who noticed them. Production began in 2010 and slowly progressed over the next four years whenever Green had free time between projects. Green suffered two major setbacks during filming: the death of his friend Dave Brockie, and his divorce from Rileah Vanderbilt. Both events caused him to question the project, and he was tempted to remove their scenes. In both cases, he was convinced not to. In order to keep a low profile, Green announced that he was making an art documentary. He said this because he believed that the only way the film could work was if it were not hyped, and he knew that the film would attract unwanted attention if its true subject matter were leaked. The opening interviews were unscripted, but everything else was. The actors were not given a full script but had to work with only their own lines. Barratt was the only actor who read the entire script. Despite some reviews that praised the film as a guerrilla production, it was not. Most of the film's effects were practical. Sculptor Greg Aronowitz worked off of Pardee's designs, and Pardee supervised. Robert Pendergraft created the make-up effects, fabricated the monsters, and operated them. Green knew that he would have to show monsters in a self-described monster film, but the team had difficulty in creating working animatronic monsters, as Pardee's designs were so surreal. Green said there were no ego issues involved in the process, and Pardee and Aronowitz still enjoy collaborating in their spare time for fun. When each monster was designed, it would inspire different monsters. Green said that he wanted to use monster designs that were unique, instead of redoing designs that had been seen many times before. According to Green, because the studios were uninterested in original designs, the film was only possible as an independent production.  Release  An early cut was shown at Butt-Numb-A-Thon in 2013. Digging up the Marrow premiered at the London FrightFest Film Festival on August 23, 2014. It was released to video on demand on February 20, 2015, and Green went on a tour to distribute the film. Green said of the self-distribution that it is impossible to get a fair deal with sites like Netflix and Hulu without a major distributor. In order to avoid these poor deals and issues with distributors who claim to have not made any money, they decided to handle everything themselves. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 24, 2015. This version contains 25‚Äì30 minutes of extended footage that was cut from the film.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 60% of 20 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.7/10. Metacritic rated it 45/100 based on eight reviews. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"a playfully self-reflexive exercise whose endless in-jokes will best be appreciated by only the most ardent genre aficionados\\". Maitland McDonagh of Film Journal International wrote, \\"A meta-variation on Clive Barker's Nightbreed, Digging Up the Marrow tackles all the same questions‚Äìwhat makes a monster, are they good or bad, et al.‚Äîwith considerably less grace and intelligence.\\" Michael Rechtshaffen of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"more mind-numbing than bone-chilling\\". Nick Schager of The Village Voice wrote that after poking fun at found footage films, it becomes \\"the very dull, clich√©d thing it mocks.\\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club rated it B‚àí and called it \\"more playful than genuinely creepy\\" and said that it does not live up to its potential. Ken W. Hanley of Fangoria rated it 2.5/4 stars and described its ambition as both its greatest asset and downfall. Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com rated it 1.5/4 stars and wrote, \\"Digging Up the Marrow is a decent idea, but beyond some fun creature effects, and a surprisingly grounded performance from character actor Ray Wise, the film just sits there.\\" Wes Greene of Slant Magazine rated it 2/4 stars and said that it \\"ultimately becomes the shopworn horror story that Green purports to upend with plenty of self-aware snark\\". Matt Donato of We Got This Covered rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it \\"a tense, confident, and gorgeously terrifying monster movie that turns Alex Pardee's artistry into vibrant, eye-catching horrors.\\" Mike D'Angelo of The Dissolve rated it 3/5 stars and called it \\"more of an affectionate comedy than a horror movie, despite a third act that features some tense moments and hostile critters.\\" Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that the film \\"can be very fun at times, but overall Digging Up the Marrow is a tiresome and exasperatingly self- aggrandizing trip.\\" Scott Hallam of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \\"Not only is it an extremely clever and unique movie experience, it gives Green‚Äôs fans exactly what they want: more Adam Green.\\" Patrick Bromley of Daily Dead rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \\"Digging Up the Marrow isn't just a terrific horror movie; it's a movie about why we are drawn to horror movies.\\"  References   External links   Category:2014 films Category:2014 horror films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:Found footage films Category:American mockumentary films Category:American monster movies Category:2010s monster movies ","title":"Digging Up the Marrow"},{"id":"46238459","text":"Main Reading Room.

History View of the church The church has been around since the Middle Ages. The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1360, but it was not new at that time. That church was a stave church with a tower that was located at Holmedal. In both the 1600s and 1700s, major repairs were undertaken, including removing the tower. The nave measured approximately with a choir that measured about . In 1724, the church was purchased from the Crown by Henrik H. Formann, the manager of the Lyse Abbey. The church was sold along with hundreds of other churches to raise money to pay down the debt from the Great Northern War. In 1814, the old church was torn down and the owner at that time, Haktor Amundsen Tveit, paid to build a new church on the same site. The new church was a small rectangular church without a separate choir and no tower. In 1866, the parish purchased the church back from private owners at a cost of 325 Norwegian speciedalers. After the church was constructed the local parish priest, P. B√∏ckmann complained that it \\"looks like a barn building and not like a church, it is a cramped house, has no chancel building, no tower, not even a marking that indicates it is God's house\\" (). On 11 December 1880, a royal resolution was passed that approved the moving of the Holmedal Church from its historic location to one that was more centrally located in the parish, about to the southwest in the village of Ut√•ker. In 1882, the church was taken down, moved, and rebuilt using a new design by the local lensmann F. √òvrevik from Sk√•nevik. The new church has a choir that is approximately and the nave is about .

Mark continues to reside in Memphis, Tennessee.Karen Ott Mayer: Greaney pursues right idea in first novel, lands sequels. In: The Commercial Appeal, 2 July 2009. Writing career  The Gray Man  Greaney previously worked as a waiter and bartender for ten years, then later in a surgical technology company, while working on two novels in his spare time. After finishing one of them, titled Goon Squad and was primarily about the aftermath of the Bosnian civil war, he gave the first 20 pages of his work to his favorite author Ralph Peters's agent, Scott Miller, in a book conference in September 2006. Miller liked the book but later did not go forward with it, saying that \\"it was unmarketable,\\" according to Greaney. But he urged Greaney to write another one based from a character in Goon Squad named Court Gentry, which would later be The Gray Man. After finishing this novel, Miller agreed to represent him, and later found a publisher, Jove Books. The national success of The Gray Man made Greaney quit his job in the medical devices company and make the transition to becoming a full-time writer. He was later given a three-book deal by his publisher in 2009.Leonard Gill: Good Aim In: The Memphis Flyer, 4 October 2009. In addition, The Gray Man's success spawned an equally successful series, with eight more sequels as of 2020: On Target (2010), Ballistic (2011), Dead Eye (2013), Back Blast (2016),Greaney, Mark. Back Blast. New York: Berkley Books, 2016. Gunmetal Gray (2017), Agent in Place (2018), Mission Critical (2019), and One Minute Out (2020). The film adaptation of The Gray Man is set to be directed by Joe and Anthony Russo for Netflix, with Ryan Gosling to star as Gentry and Chris Evans as nemesis Lloyd.  Working with Tom Clancy  Greaney has been a fan of Tom Clancy for years, and has read all of his books, beginning with Patriot Games. So when Clancy was looking for a new co-author, Greaney found out that his editor at Berkley Books, Tom Colgan, was also Clancy's editor at G. P. Putnam's Sons. His editor later referred to his agent, who asked Greaney to be Clancy's co- author. Commenting on the experience, Greaney recalled: \\"I wish I could say I was excited, but the truth is, I was terrified. After I caught my breath, I offered to 'try out' because there were some other authors also in the running. I wrote twenty-five pages, handed them in and soon thereafter, I was in Baltimore meeting with Tom Clancy.\\" They later collaborated on Clancy's last three novels before his death in October 2013: Locked On (2012), Threat Vector (2013), and Command Authority (2013).Peggy Burch: The Gray Man Returns In: The Commercial Appeal, 1 December 2013. After Clancy's death, with the backing of his family and estate, Greaney continued the Jack Ryan and The Campus Universe left behind by Clancy, and has written four more novels as of 2016: Tom Clancy: Support and Defend (2014),Felix Gillette: https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-07-17/support-and-defend-tom- clancys-legacy-lives-on Support and Defend, Tom Clancy's Legacy Lives On] In: Bloomberg, 17 July 2014.

Regarding the publisher's decision to feature Clancy's name at the top in massive letters and having his name in smaller letters for the covers of the post-Clancy novels, Greaney commented: \\"It really feels like a humongous honor to do it. I get pretty good billing. The Tom Clancy name is one thing you can put on your book that will make it stand out from across the room\\". On 19 February 2017, Greaney announced that he will exit the Jack Ryan Universe franchise. Replacing Greaney will be novelist Marc Cameron, previously known for his Jericho Quinn series of thrillers. Greaney later said of his departure from the Jack Ryan universe: Other works Greaney's first standalone work, a military thriller titled Red Metal and co-authored with Lieutenant Colonel H. Ripley Rawlings IV, USMC, was released on 16 July 2019. The novel debuted on the New York Times Bestseller list in August 2019. This was the first time Greaney appeared in the NYT Bestseller's list twice in the same calendar year. The book is notable for its comparisons to Clancy's novel Red Storm Rising (1986), which is also his first standalone novel that deals with a large scale military conflict between NATO and Russia.

After ten years in Brooklyn, the couple moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where Misch opened his first department store. His holdings would expand to ten department stores throughout New England. After his unexpected death in 1908, Marion became the only female owner of a department store in Providence. Activities In 1905 she helped found the Providence section of the National Council of Jewish Women, serving as its first president, and in 1908 was appointed third president of the National Council of Jewish Women, a position she held for five years. She also served as president of various charitable societies. She was a member of the board of directors of the Providence Society for Organizing Charity; a member of the board of managers of the Providence District Nursing Association; and a member of the Sex Hygiene Committee of the Rhode Island State Conference of Charities.

The technology was designed, patented, and is currently used by the Microlife Corporation. It has been the subject of numerous medical studies and has been validated for in-home and clinical use. It can be found in several Microlife devices, including the WatchBP Home A, BP A200 Plus, WatchBP Office, and WatchBP O3. Specifications Microlife WatchBP Home A blood pressure monitor with Afib detection. The Microlife devices that use the AFIB Technology are oscillometric and are equipped with an algorithm that can detect irregular pulse rhythms. The device will flash if atrial fibrillation is detected. Measurements are carried out in triplicate for more accurate readings. Studies have confirmed the relative accuracy of such readings when attempting to identify the existence of atrial fibrillation in patients. One study indicated that the Microlife blood pressure monitor had a sensitivity for detecting atrial fibrillation of 100%, a specificity of 92%. Several clinical studies have tested the Microlife AFIB Technology against 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) interpreted by cardiologists. The sensitivity for detection in these studies varied between 95 and 100% with specificity values of 89 to 92%. Microlife A200 blood pressure monitor with Afib detection. One study noted that the WatchBP device was better for detecting atrial fibrillation than single-lead ECGs because of its higher specificity level (90 vs 76%, respectively), which would prevent many unnecessary refers for a 12-lead ECG and therefore safes labor and healthcare costs. In addition, it does not require clinical interpretation. In virtually every study, researchers have concluded that Microlife's AFIB Technology is suitable for use as an atrial fibrillation detection system for in-home and/or clinical purposes. In 2013, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended the WatchBP Home A device for routine blood pressure measurement and atrial fibrillation screening in primary care. The recommendation is based on the NICE conclusion that use of WatchBP Home A in primary care is associated with estimated overall cost savings per person measured, ranging from ¬£2.98 for those aged between 65 and 74 years to ¬£4.26 for those aged 75 years and over.

Currently based in Aptos, California, SPACES boasts an archive of approximately 35,000 photographs as well as hundreds of books, articles, audio and video tapes/DVDs, and artists‚Äô documents. SPACES has become recognized internationally as the largest and most complete archive on this subject. SPACES maintains an online index of more than 1,400 art environments around the world, exhibiting its collection of images, documents, and writings, and also providing further reading on the artists and their built environments. The organization also provides resources and best practices on the preservation of threatened sites. In June 2017, SPACES announced a partnership with the Kohler Foundation to transfer SPACES‚Äô archives and the operation of the website to the only foundation in the country dedicated to the preservation of art environments. The Kohler Foundation, which is the philanthropic organization founded by the Kohler family of Wisconsin, has committed extensive resources to the present and future of SPACES' mission and archives for \\"generations to come.\\"  History  SPACES was organized in 1969 and then formally Incorporated in 1978 by Founding Director Seymour Rosen, a Los Angeles photographer who became interested in the aesthetic genre of art environments after photographing Watts Towers. His images of this iconic artwork ‚Äì including those of the infamous 1959 \\"stress-test\\" that proved the Towers‚Äô stability ‚Äì resulted in Rosen's first major solo photographic exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1962, titled Simon Rodia's Towers in Watts.http://www.lacma.org/simon-rodia‚Äôs-towers-watts-photographic-exhibition- seymour-rosen Rosen also authored the 1979 book In Celebration of Ourselves. As the founder of the SPACES organization, Rosen was invited to serve on the board of directors of Raw Vision with its inception, and from its first issue in 1989 contributed often to its pages. In 1992 he was honored by the Folk Art Society of America with their Award of Distinction for his ‚Äúpioneering work in the field of environmental documentation and preservation.‚Äù. This included advocacy such as successfully designating sites for the California State Landmark registry, including Grandma Prisbrey's Bottle Village in Simi Valley and Nitt Witt Ridge in Cambria. After Rosen died in 2006, Jo Farb Hern√°ndez, a folklorist, curator, and award-winning writer, became the second Executive Director of SPACES, after having worked with Rosen since 1985. Hern√°ndez is a 40+ year veteran of the art world, and Director of the Natalie and James Thompson Art Gallery and Professor in the Department of Art and Art History at San Jose State University.

It adjoined the H. J. Heinz factories. The house's mission was: to provide wholesome social and recreational opportunities; to utilize leisure time and energy; to study individual requirements and awaken and direct latent ability; to develop Christian character and train for efficient citizenship the young people of the community; to draw together neighborhood residents and friends for mutual helpfulness: to train for service in the community. Establishment The Sarah Heinz House was erected in 1914 by H. J. Heinz as a memorial to his wife, Sarah Young Heinz. The institution was supported and conducted entirely by members of the Heinz family. The settlement work in this connection was begun in 1901 by Howard Heinz, a son of the founder. It started as a local boys' club in a small building on Progress street nearby. The first quarters consisted of three rooms and a bath room on the first floor of a tenement. Boys came in increasing numbers and soon the entire house was occupied, and given the name \\"Covode House.\\" Two years later, the girls of the neighborhood were organized into two groups; the younger into a sewing school, and the older into an evening club. The building becoming too small, another small building was secured as well as a natatorium and gymnasium. In 1914, the present building with its increased facilities was erected and formally opened June 6, 1915. At one time, the enrollment was about 400, equally divided between boys and girls. The Settlement contained a swimming pool, billiard room, and game rooms. The fees in the Boys' Department, payable semi-annually, ranged from US$0.10 for boys under 12 to $1.50 for boys over 18. A variety of activities were included, such as gymnastic classes, athletic competition, basketball, swimming meets, and a training school for leaders and officers. The Girls' Department activities were largely along the lines of homemaking. There was a Saturday sewing school for young girls under fourteen, with ten classes graded according to ability. These girls had the use of the swimming pool and the gymnasium one afternoon each week. The older girls were organized into five groups, and members of all groups were eligible to the classes in dress making, housekeeping, cooking and dancing. The older girls paid a membership fee of $1.00 in two installments. A small fee was charged in addition to cover the cost of food supplies in cooking lessons. There were reception and club rooms on the second floor for the exclusive use of girls, and a large kitchen on the third floor. There was a three-room apartment also for occasional use in the demonstration of the various housekeeping activities. The older girls had the use of the gymnasium and swimming pool one evening each week. Recreation was afforded by games, books and magazines; a victrola was also available. In the sense of doctrinal teaching, there was no distinctive religious training. The attitude of the Sarah Heinz House was that of co-operation with other agencies that work to the betterment of the people of the neighborhood. The afternoon Sunday program was an informal affair where talks were given by citizens on interesting subjects, with a musical program attached. Another feature was the course of extension lectures given by the Carnegie Institute. The City Health Department operated a permanent milk station in the building with attendant physicians and nurses who distributed the milk and gave instruction as to the care and feeding of infants to the mothers of the neighborhood. The Magee Maternity Hospital had headquarters in the building in which they conducted a maternity dispensary. Summer work was conducted on the roof garden, which was also adapted for the playing of basketball. The YMCA and the YWCA cooperated in the work of the House, and through these, many of the older boys and girls were able to enjoy camping experiences.

Mulholland left ARTS after it folded into Arts & Entertainment. Always interested in pre-1960s Hollywood films, Mulholland was intrigued by the posthumous reputations of such stars as Gary Cooper and Glenn Ford, and directors such as Fred Zinnemann and William Wyler, whose legacies had suffered because of the auteur theory so prevalent in critical and academic circles. Mulholland went on to explore, in two documentaries, both Cooper as actor and as central participant in the complex political controversies which almost derailed two of his most notable films: *Inside High Noon: Inside High Noon examines the political and blacklisting controversy ‚Äî and Cooper's integral role in combating blacklisting ‚Äî during the filming of the 1952 film classic, High Noon.

It was built from to 1940s. It is also known as Cassim's Hotel and Sorrento Flats. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 October 1995.  History  Cleveland Hotel, ca. 1871 This two-storeyed masonry hotel was built for John Vincent Cassim and his wife Mary Teally, Cleveland boarding house/hotel keepers since 1855. Cassim was a Mauritian Indian, whom it appears was transported to Moreton Bay in 1840. A person named Cassim, who had been tried at the Port Louis assizes, and had received a seven-year sentence, was amongst a group of Mauritian convicts who were transported to Sydney via the Layton early in 1840 (Mauritius had been occupied by the British since 1810). In April 1840 fifteen of these men, including Cassim, were sent on to Moreton Bay, which was soon to be opened for free settlement, apparently to conduct experiments in sugar growing. Sugar was the principal Mauritian cash crop at this period, and was exported regularly to New South Wales. Presumably, the Mauritian convicts were considered to have had some experience in the sugar industry. Cassim received a ticket-of-leave at Moreton Bay in February 1844, and in mid-1845 a John Cassim and his wife Mary were resident in Brisbane Town. It is likely that Cassim, John Cassim and John Vincent Cassim, who married at Moreton Bay an Irish girl named Mary Teally, were one and the same person. Little is known about Mary, or how she came to be at Moreton Bay, other than that she had arrived in New South Wales in the early 1840s. By 1851, John and Mary Cassim were operating a boarding house at Kangaroo Point, which they maintained until late 1855. From late 1855 to mid-1860 the Cassims leased Cleveland House (now the Grandview Hotel), and an adjacent dwelling, from pastoralist Francis Edward Bigge. These buildings had been erected at Cleveland in the early 1850s as part of Bigge's unsuccessful push to establish Cleveland as the principal port of the Moreton Bay region. Amongst the earliest buildings in the township, they appear to have remained unoccupied for several years until taken up as Cassim's Family Hotel and Boarding House. In the late 1850s, with the separation of Queensland from New South Wales imminent, there was some renewal of interest in Cleveland as the port to service Ipswich, which was still a strong contender for capital of Queensland. Although Brisbane interests prevailed and Cleveland was to remain an isolated seaside resort, by 1860 the township had gained sufficient popularity as a watering place to support two hotels: the Brighton Hotel (formerly Cassim's Family Hotel), and Cassim's new hotel, the Cleveland Hotel. In 1858 JV Cassim had acquired allotment 1 of section 6, par Cleveland, adjacent to and north of Cleveland House, on the road toward Cleveland Point. On this site, , Cassim erected his Cleveland Hotel. The building was extant by September 1860, when he took out a mortgage on the property, and was required to insure the house situated on the land. About this time it was discovered that the hotel had been constructed across the southern boundary of the allotment; subsequently, a small parcel of land was surveyed as allotment 1A and purchased by Cassim in January 1861. By 1863 the hhotel comprised bar, parlour, sitting-rooms, bedrooms, storeroom, a kitchen with servant's room attached, and verandahs front and back. The grounds included stables, coachhouse, fowlhouse, garden, jetty and bathing house. In 1872/73, Cassim acquired the adjacent allotment to the north (allotment 2 of section 6), and in 1879, two adjoining blocks to the south (allotments 20 & 21 of section 6). Mary Cassim died in 1861, and was buried at Dunwich Cemetery. In 1868 John married Irish immigrant Anne (or Mary Anne) Rafter, who appears to have arrived at Moreton Bay in the mid-1860s. There were no children from either marriage. JV Cassim died in 1884, and was buried at Dunwich. Anne held the license of the Cleveland Hotel until 1903, and retained the property until 1916. She died at the Dunwich Benevolent Asylum in 1921, and was buried at the Nudgee Catholic Cemetery. The Cassims were well- known and respected Cleveland identities and devout Catholics, whose hotel not only was synonymous with Cleveland as a seaside resort, but also served as a mass centre from the early 1860s until the construction of the first Catholic church at Cleveland in 1877. John was a trustee of the local church in the 1870s and 1880s, and would not accept payment from any priest staying at the hotel. Cassim's Island, in Moreton Bay, is named after him. By a verandah had been added to the southern side of the hotel, and the shingled roof had been replaced with corrugated iron. About 1919 the southern allotments containing the gardens were resurveyed into eight subdivisions, six of which were sold. Rear view of the Cleveland Hotel after being damaged by a storm, June 1929 The building was renovated , and continued to function as the Cleveland Hotel until severely storm damaged in June 1929. The property changed ownership in July 1929, but whether the building was repaired at this stage is not clear. In July and August 1929, Brisbane architect John Patrick Donoghue called tenders for the rebuilding of the Cleveland Hotel, but in 1930 publican Nicholas John Thurecht, who had acquired the lease of the Cleveland Hotel in 1927, had removed to the new centre of Cleveland township and the new Raby Bay Hotel (now the Cleveland Sands Hotel), for which Donoghue had called tenders in September and October 1929. Local residents believe the old Cleveland Hotel remained vacant until converted into flats during or just after the Second World War. This may correspond to a change in ownership in 1948. The renovations, still evident, included rebuilding the roof with its present gables and chimney stacks; removal of what was left of the southern and rear verandahs; replacing the front verandah balustrading with weatherboards; cutting additional doors in the north and south walls; and rendering the exterior. In the 1940s and 1950s, the former Cleveland Hotel appears to have been known as the Sorrento Flats. The building is understood to have remained unoccupied since the 1960s, possibly following another change in ownership in 1965. In 2000, the building was restored and in 2010 was used as commercial office space.  Description  The former Cleveland Hotel, fronting Moreton Bay and located on the steep east facing slope of the ridge running along Cleveland Point, appears as a single-storeyed rendered masonry building from Shore Street, but has a lower floor facing the water. The building has a corrugated iron hipped roof with two projecting gables and a skillion roofed verandah with a central gabled entrance porch to the western street side. There are two chimney stacks and the gables have fibrous-cement sheeting with timber cover strips and weatherboards. The west verandah has a weatherboard balustrade with rectangular open batten panels. There is a skillion roofed east verandah to the lower floor which has had the northern end and the entrance stairs damaged. The base of the building consists of rubble with concrete piers and concrete supports for the east verandah. Interior walls are of rendered masonry with some fibrous cement partitions and the original arched entrance has been bricked in. A few casement windows survive, but most of the windows, doors and all of the French doors opening onto the front verandah have been removed. The upper floor is of timber. There is no internal access between floors. A weatherboard double garage with a corrugated iron gable roof is located to the south at street level. This is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. The steep site levels off to a flat foreshore area with a concrete retaining wall to the water. The hotel has views across water to Stradbroke Island to the east and Raby Bay to the northwest.  Heritage listing  The former Cleveland Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 October 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Cleveland Hotel, erected , is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history, being associated with the establishment of the township of Cleveland in the 1850s and 1860s and with the evolution of Cleveland as a popular seaside resort in the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The place is an integral element in a group of historic buildings along the road leading to Cleveland Point. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It demonstrates rare aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage, being one of the earliest surviving buildings in Cleveland and a rare surviving Queensland example of a substantial, , two-storeyed masonry hotel, the structure and fabric of which is strongly evident despite the 20th century conversion to flats. It has potential to reveal information about 1850s/60s construction techniques and materials in Queensland.

Paget was the top architect in Canton around the turn of the 20th century. He often met the presidents of China, Sun Yat-Sen and Chiang Kai-shek at the time, and invited them to his apartment to stay and work. Sun Yat-Sen's residence and office, the Marshal House, was designed by Paget, as were many of the buildings constructed in Canton during this time period, like the urban police department and the urban fire station.

To be considered ‚Äúprofessionals,‚Äù individuals of this group must attain a professional degree and operate under a license. According to the US Census Bureau, a Mexican American is defined as an individual who can self-identify as Hispanic or Latino as part of their heritage, nationality group, lineage, country of birth, or ancestors‚Äô country of birth. The US Census Bureau states that any individual of any race may identify themselves as of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin. Thus, many individuals of Mexican American status live in each of the fifty states.  Stereotypes  Current stereotypes portray Mexican Americans as professionals only in the fields of wrestling, boxing, and other sports-related careers. Studies have indicated that more Mexican Americans are attaining higher education degrees in the fields of science, health care, educational services, and social assistance. Between 2008 and 2009, Mexican Americans made up an .8% increase in educational, health care, and social assistance professional degrees acquired.  Careers  Mexican Americans are increasing in numbers in college enrollment and degree completion rates. Between 2010 and 2012, college enrollment increased by .5% for the total population and by 1.4% by Mexican Americans. Mexican Americans are most often obtaining associate degrees (21.9%), bachelor‚Äôs degrees (7.0%), and graduate or professional degrees (2.9%). These numbers, from 2012, have also risen since 2010. Mexican Americans make up 16.6% of management, business, science, and arts occupations, and 10.2% of professional, scientific, management and administrative, and waste management services occupations, compared to 36.1% and 10.9% of the general population, respectively. This shows promise for this population of individuals, as their numbers in the professional workforce continue to rise.

He was a minister in the governments of Alf Morgans (1901), Walter James (1902‚Äì1904), and Hector Rason (1905‚Äì1906). Moss was born in New Zealand and arrived in Western Australia in 1891. He left for England in 1914 and spent the rest of his life there, although he maintained connections with Australia, on two occasions acting as Agent-General for Western Australia. Early life Moss was born to a Jewish family in Dunedin, New Zealand, where his father, formerly resident in Victoria, was a music teacher and choirmaster. His grandfather, also Matthew Moss, had been choirmaster at the Great Synagogue of London.(21 October 1904). \\"DUNEDIN, N.Z.\\" ‚Äì Jewish Herald (Victoria). Educated in New Zealand, Moss served his articles with his uncle, Joel Barnett Lewis, before being admitted to the bar in 1886.(15 May 1900). \\"MR. M. L. MOSS\\" ‚Äì The Daily News (Perth). After several years at Hokitika, Moss arrived in Western Australia in 1891, practising first at Fremantle and later in Perth. From 1904, his partner was John Dwyer, a future Chief Justice of Western Australia. Parliamentary career Moss first stood for parliament at the 1894 election, where he placed last of three candidates in the seat of North Fremantle, with 26.50% of the vote. However, the sitting member, William Pearse, resigned his seat the following year to travel to England, and Moss was elected at the resulting by-election. He attempted to transfer to the new seat of East Fremantle at the 1897 election, but was defeated by Joseph Holmes by a margin of six votes.Black and Prescott (1997), p. 103. After losing his seat in parliament, Moss stood in the elections for the new East Fremantle Municipality, and was elected the inaugural mayor of East Fremantle.Black, David, and Bolton, Geoffrey (1990). Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia: Volume One (1870‚Äì1930) , p. 146. He held that position until May 1900, when he defeated Daniel Keen Congdon to become one of the three MLCs for West Province. When first Leake government fell in November 1901, Alf Morgans nominated Moss to fill the role of Colonial Secretary in his new ministry. Under the state constitution at the time, newly appointed ministers were required to resign and recontest their seats in a by-election. These were often uncontested, but the outgoing premier, George Leake, organised opposing candidates in each seat. Moss and two other ministers, Frank Wilson and Frederick Moorhead, were defeated, with the second Leake government consequently sworn in a few weeks later. Moss's time out of parliament was short, however ‚Äì he nominated for the vacancy in West Province left by the retirement of Alfred Kidson, and was elected uncontested, being sworn in in May 1902.Black (1991), p. 41. George Leake died in June 1902, and Moss was back in favour in the new ministry led by Walter James, becoming (along with John Nanson) a minister without portfolio. This situation persisted until the defeat of James's government in parliament after the 1904 state election, after which Henry Daglish was sworn in as Western Australia's first Labour Party premier. The Daglish government collapsed in August 1905, and Moss was again made a minister without portfolio in the new Rason ministry. As a practising lawyer, he had been considered a candidate for the position of Attorney-General, but the new premier, Hector Rason, instead appointed himself as Minister for Justice. Moss's status as a member of the upper house was considered to have weighed against him.(10 February 1962). \\"Government Breaks A Tradition When Appointing Minister\\" ‚Äì The Canberra Times. Rason was replaced as premier by Newton Moore less than a year later, and Moss did not retain his position in cabinet. At the 1908 election, he was opposed by a Labour candidate, William Carpenter, but retained his seat.Black (1991), p. 63. He joined the short-lived Liberal Party upon its creation in 1911, and remained in parliament until 1914, when he left for London. Later life Having been appointed King's Counsel in 1906, Moss continued his legal work in England. At various stages he acted as a legal adviser for the state government in Britain. On two occasions he was also acting Agent-General for Western Australia. Following the result of the 1933 secession referendum, Moss, a longtime advocate of the withdrawal of Western Australia from the Commonwealth, was made one of four members of the unsuccessful delegation to the British government, along with Sir Hal Colebatch, James MacCallum Smith, and Keith Watson.(23 September 1934). \\"Mr. M.

He and his ex-prostitute lover Rose Slater also have moved into the Grayson manor, childhood home of Rockwell Grayson, who has been away fighting in the war. After ostensibly going to see inspector general Hildebrandt to request he investigate Hale's activities, Rock instead returns to form an alliance with Hale, offering to become his tax collector and siding with him publicly against the townspeople. Jane Colfax, his former sweetheart, is shocked by Rock's behavior, as are others. Rose's greed leads her to purchase a nearby plantation with Hale's ill-gotten gains and offer to cut Rock in on their profits. She also persuades Hale to sign a document bequeathing his possessions to her should anything happen to him. Rock is revealed to be working undercover on the general's behalf, gaining information to use against Hale. A former union officer, Kirby, learns of Rock's real mission. Rock is shot and reveals his true purpose to Jane, who forgives him and threatens Rose with a pair of scissors. Rose then shoots Hale, possibly by mistake, possibly not.

Virginia pauses while knitting, seemingly lost in thought. Across the room, Stoddard's mother focuses on a game of solitaire. The large, rectangular space between the two women emphasizes the psychological distance between them in their respective moments of quiet contemplation. Stoddard visited and lived in Monhegan, Maine, and integrated the people and scenery in her paintings.\\" She painted Manville Davis, a fisherman in Mending the Nets and a portrait of artist Andrew Winter. The area became an enclave for artists, some of the other artists who painted and visited there were Robert Henri, the Wyeth family (N. C., Andrew, and Jamie), and Charles Ebert.

Geography The Matk Cirque lies in the upper catchment area of the Savinja RiverNatek, Karel. 1992. Discover Slovenia. Ljubljana: Cankarjeva zalo≈æba, p. 14. in the Kamnik‚ÄìSavinja Alps of Slovenia. The valley floor ranges between and in elevation. It is surrounded by high mountains to the southwest, from Cold Mountain (, ) to the west to Mount Savinjka () to the east. The border between Slovenia and Austria runs along the western ridge, and to the east it borders the Logar Valley. The Matk Cirque is relatively remote and difficult to reach. There is a forest road into it from the Logar Valley, which also connects the farms in it. At the bottom of the valley, this road branches off from the road leading to the former border crossing at the Pavliƒç Pass (, ; ) in the Karawanks. The valley is about long and has the most characteristic glacial features in its upper half. Below Cold Mountain in the southwest part of the valley there are well-formed cirques. The eastern ridge above the valley consists of solid dolomite. The southern part of the valley consists of Triassic limestone, and it is only in the north that late Paleozoic impermeable rock is exposed, which is already part of the Karawanks. The valley floor spreads out only in the upper part of the cirque. The valley floor is filled by gravel carried by flashy streams and glacial moraines. Jezera Creek has its source in the middle of the valley; below its spring it has carved out and narrowed the valley, creating the picturesque Lamotje Gorge in the limestone rock where it enters the Logar Valley. During the Pleistocene the valley was filled by a glacier that extended to the Logar Valley and joined the glacier there. Natural monuments At the head of the Matk Cirque is a cliff known as (), below which is a snowfield named ≈†kaf (literally, 'basket'), a natural monument.

The entrance to the petilasan to Mbah Atas Angin is beside it. Pancuran Tujuh (, both meaning \\"Seven Springs\\") is a hot spring located on the slopes of Mount Slamet in Baturraden District, Banyumas, Central Java. Discovered, according to local legend, by a Muslim missionary known as Mbah Atas Angin, the hot spring and its sulfuric waters are considered to have healing properties. Location Road to Pancuran Tujuh, 2015 Pancuran Tujuh is located in Kemutung Lor Village, Baturraden District, Banyumas, Central Java, amidst a pine forest on the slopes of Mount Slamet. It is situated some to the west of the Baturraden Tourist Resort, and about north of the city of Purwokerto. The hot spring is accessible by paved road, though, , it is in poor condition, and as such it is more common for visitors to take motorcycles than cars. Pancuran Tujuh can also be accessed by a walk through the Baturraden resort. From the parking area, visitors must descend about 200 steps (a distance of ) to reach the springs. History According to local legend, a man named Syekh Maulana Maghribi (known locally as Mbah Atas Angin [Grandfather from the Winds] as he had come a great distance) discovered the springs. Sailing to Gresik on Java to spread Islam, he and a follower spotted a strange light. They followed it to Pemalang, then made their way overland. However, Maghribi fell ill with a strange skin condition, and received a vision that he had to climb the southern mountains to treat it. There he found seven springs, which he named Pancuran Pitu, and bathed in the waters, treating himself. The Pancuran Tujuh area is, , managed by the state-owned Perhutani company. Description Mineral deposits from Pancuran Tujuh Pancuran Tujuh, as suggested by the name, consists of seven natural springs which release water at a temperature of . The waters drop about from the outlets. A 2003 study found the spring to have a consistent flow, averaging a day. The waters contain sulfur and other minerals, with the sulfur content measuring 230.8 parts per million. As such, the waters are considered to have healing properties by local residents, and the springs are used to treat skin conditions and rheumatism. The sulfuric waters of Pancuran Tujuh pour down the slope, and over the centuries have left a mineral deposit. Waters from Pancuran Tujuh also pool in nearby caves. These include Sarabadak, where Mbah Atas Angin and his followers are held to have lived, as well as Kembar, Selirang, and Sri Warna. Sarabadak serves as a petilasan (monument) to Mbah Atas Angin, with its entrance located next to the springs. The path to Pancuran Tujuh overlooks nearby Purwokerto, with the cities of Purbalingga and Cilacap visible on clear days.

The company currently employs about 450 people. The Metal Mulisha Monster Jam Monster truck was debuted in 2012 at Reliant Stadium in Houston, TX. Clothing Formed in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, Metal Mulisha T-shirts were fashionable among youth in the 2000s. The shirts often feature existential slogans or quotes that tout the virtues of extreme sports. In 2010, the Murrieta Valley Unified School District banned Metal Mulisha clothing at its schools, due to graphics resembling Nazi symbols and iconography. Some graphics appearing on Metal Mulisha's clothing line include a skull wearing a helmet resembling one worn by German soldiers in World War II, while on the company's logo, the \\"S\\" in \\"Mulisha\\" is represented graphically by a lightning bolt that resembles the double lightning bolts insignia Runic \\"·õã·õã\\" of the Nazi major paramilitary organization Schutzstaffel, or SS. Rabbi Barry Ulrych, of the B‚Äônai Chaim of Murrieta synagogue, regarding the images appearing on Metal Mulisha products, stated ‚ÄúPeople say it‚Äôs just a fashion ‚Äî it‚Äôs more than that ‚Äî it‚Äôs an identity...These symbols are not as neutral as one might think.

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 March 1994.  History  Fernleigh, consisting of a timber cottage and adjoining timber kitchen house, is located on Shore Street East in the area around the Cleveland Point where much of the early development of Cleveland took place. Fernleigh was permanently occupied from the early-mid 1880s by William Taylor, following his retirement from his business in Brisbane. The first land sale took place in Cleveland in 1851, and was considered a great success, being described as \\"...The competition for the Cleveland lots was very spirited...the result [of the sale] shows considerable confidence\\". At the time of the sale, Ipswich was still a strong contender for the capital of Queensland and there was strong rivalry between Cleveland (promoted by Ipswich interests, supported in turn by the Darling Downs squatters) and Brisbane, as to which would become the port to serve the north. The allotments on which Fernleigh stands, lots 14-16 of section 11, were acquired in the 1851 land sale by Jeremiah Scanlan, Robert Cribb and William Augustine Duncan respectively. The three men were actively involved in the development of the Moreton Bay settlement: Scanlan as a Brisbane hotel proprietor; Cribb as a baker and politician who acquired extensive land interests; and Duncan, a former Sydney journalist who took up a position as Sub-Collector of Customs in Brisbane from 1846. As records do not clearly identify whether it was lot 15 or lot 16 on which Fernleigh was built, it is unclear whether it was Cribb or Duncan who actually was responsible for the erection of Fernleigh. It is however, evident that each of these men had an interest in the development of Cleveland and closely followed the debate regarding the future role of the township. During the early 1850s, Cribb bought much land at both Brisbane and Cleveland land sales, apparently not wanting to \\"miss out\\" when the decision between Brisbane and Cleveland was made. Duncan was a strong advocate of settlement at Cleveland, expressing the opinion that \\"... Brisbane can never be aught but a country village...\\" and that \\"...the Government should not hesitate to open a Township at Cleveland Point...\\". Locally, it is held that Fernleigh was built during the 1860s as a holiday house for William Taylor, who had arrived in Brisbane in 1849 on Chaseley, one of emigrant ships organised by the Rev Dr John Dunmore Lang. It is possible however, that references to Taylor at Cleveland during this period derive from his purchase of land, in the vicinity of Fernleigh, in the 1851 land sale. By the late 1850s, Brisbane was finally recognised as the main port for Queensland. Cleveland remained isolated, developing into one of two fashionable Brisbane holiday resorts, the other being Sandgate to the north of Brisbane. The Taylor family's first recorded connection with Fernleigh is in 1879, when Taylor's daughters, Ellen, Ann and Elizabeth acquired lots 14-15. Also in 1879, Taylor purchased the Cleveland State School building for , and it is understood that he moved this building to Fernleigh where it became the kitchen house. Prior to being used as a schoolhouse, the building was a cottage/shop in Cleveland, on land owned by the Hon Arthur Macalister (three times Queensland Premier). It was acquired by the Board of Education in 1868 for use as the first Cleveland State School which opened in April of that year. Taylor acquired lot 16 in 1882, possibly at the same time he retired from his business (early-mid 1880s). Taylor moved to Fernleigh, where he lived until his death in December 1895. The title to lot 16 passed to Taylor's daughters, and Fernleigh remained in the Taylor family until the 1960s. The house was proposed to be converted into flats during the 1970s/early 1980s. Fernleigh was acquired by the present owners in 1987.  Description  View from Cross Street, 2015 Fernleigh, fronting Shore Street East to the northwest and bounded by GJ Walker Park to the east and south, is a single-storeyed timber residence with a detached kitchen house overlooking Moreton Bay and Stradbroke Island to the east. The residence has a corrugated iron gable roof, in which an attic space has been enclosed in recent years, with a large dormer window to both the northwest and southeast. The building has both timber and concrete stumps, with a timber batten skirt to the perimeter. It has verandahs to all sides with corrugated iron skillion roofs, boarded soffits and timber posts. The exterior walls are weatherboard and the building has sash windows of cedar, some of which have timber shutters, with a row of more recent silky oak sash windows to the eastern corner room. The southwest corner of the verandah has been enclosed with vertical boarding to form a bathroom and storeroom. Internally, the building has four rooms with a central corridor. A stair has been added to the western room to access the attic bedroom. Walls and ceilings are of unpainted beech boarding, and floors are of polished beech. A brick fireplace with a timber surround is located in the southern room. The fireplace has had its earlier render removed. The attic has been lined with hardboard sheeting, it has a pine floor and casement windows are located in the gable ends. The kitchen house is located to the south of the residence and is linked via a covered walkway. It has a corrugated iron gable roof with verandahs to three sides, the southeast wall being of weatherboard and containing a stove recess. The building has both timber and concrete stumps, with a timber batten skirt to the perimeter. The northeast verandah has weatherboard infill below the hand rail, with timber rail balustrade to the northwest and southwest. The verandah soffits are unlined and the southern corner has been enclosed to form a bathroom. The northwest wall of the kitchen house is constructed of split logs laid vertically, and the southwest wall is of pit-sawn vertical boards. Internally, the building consists of two rooms with a vertically boarded timber partition between. The ceiling is boarded, walls are lined with hardboard sheeting with timber cover strips and it has mainly sash windows. A recently constructed weatherboard garage with a corrugated iron gable roof is located at the southwest boundary. The grounds include a very large Fig tree at the southwest boundary, two large Candle Nut trees framing the driveway near the northwest boundary, a Macadamia Nut tree and Black Bean tree to the west of the residence, large Eucalypts near the western and southern corners of the site, as well as numerous smaller shrubs and flowering plants. The northwest boundary has a timber paling fence, with a timber pergola structure over the entrance gate. The northeast and southeast boundaries have wire fences.  Heritage listing  Fernleigh was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 March 1994 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Originally a cottage, the kitchen house was used as the first Cleveland State School prior to its removal and re-erection at Fernleigh. Fernleigh is located on the land which was part of the first survey and sale at Cleveland in 1851 and demonstrates the pattern of subdivision and development of Cleveland along the peninsula. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Fernleigh is characteristic of a modest 1860s timber dwelling, having a four-room core and detached kitchen house. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The timber buildings and established garden have aesthetic quality, and form an integral part of the mature townscape of Cleveland Point. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. These structures remain as two of few surviving buildings associated with the development of Cleveland from the 1860s, and as such maintain a special association with the community.

Establishment It was formed as a result of increasing tensions within the Australian Labor Party over the party's economic response to the Great Depression in Australia. The opponents of austerity in the Labor Party, of which Lang was among the most prominent figures, had supported repudiating Australia's debt, while supporters of austerity policies would subsequently introduce the national \\"Premiers' Plan\\" to achieve those ends. The 1931 Labor split occurred both at a state and federal level, with Lang's supporters being known as \\"Lang Labor\\". By May 1931, the \\"Lang Plan Campaign Committee\\" had been formed in South Australia to give publicity to and campaign for Lang's ideas. Its members were not, at its inception, outside the Labor Party; however, the breach between Lang's supporters and the mainstream party quickly broadened, and reports that month suggested that a split in the party was imminent. The committee's president was Doug Bardolph, and its secretary was Tom Howard. In July 1931, a by-election was held for the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Adelaide, in the wake of Labor MP Bert Edwards being sentenced to jail. The Lang Plan Campaign Committee decided to separately contest the by-election, and the secretary of the Ironworkers' Union, Martin Collaton, was chosen as their candidate. Collaton went on to win the by-election, in which he had been usually referred to as a \\"Lang Plan supporter\\" or a \\"Lang Plan candidate\\". The supporters of Lang had begun being referred to as the \\"Lang Labor Party\\" by August 1931, by which time they had established local branches. In addition to Collaton, the party supported independent Labor state MP Bob Dale, who had been expelled from the Labor Party for supporting Lang's ideas, and who would later run for re-election under the party's banner. In October, the Lang Labor Party nominated Bardolph in a Legislative Council by-election for the Central District No. 1 seat and ran a significant campaign on his behalf, but saw him defeated by independent Joseph Anderson South Australian Lang Labor Party (SALLP) Two of the three Lang Labor Party MHAs elected at the 1933 state election, Bob Dale and Tom Howard, left the party in 1933 post-election after falling out with leader Doug Bardolph and formed their own party, the South Australian Lang Labor Party (SALLP). In June 1934 the four Labor factions were reunited.

It has small, fleshy leaves and purple to pink flowers on short stalks along the branches.  Description  Melaleuca depauperata is dense, bushy, spreading shrub growing to about high and wide with fibrous bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately around the stem and are long and wide, flat but rather fleshy and oval shaped, usually with a blunt end but sometimes with a sharp point. The flowers are mauve, pink or violet in spikes of between 4 and 17 individual flowers which fade to white as they age. The spikes are in the leaf axils, have a short stalk and are about in diameter. Flowering occurs from September to January but mainly between October and November. The fruit are almost spherical woody capsules long in loose clusters. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1852 by the Russian botanist Nikolai Turczaninow in Bulletin de la Classe physico-math√©matique de l'Acad√©mie imp√©riale des sciences de Saint-P√©tersbourg. The specific epithet (depauperata) is from the Latin depauperatus, possibly referring to the type specimen having few flowers. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca depauperata occurs inland from the Stirling Range as far as Wagin and eastwards as far as Muntadgin and the Peak Charles National Park in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions.
