In the 1980s, he owned and operated Talkeetna Air Taxi, an Alaska bush flying service. Early life Thomas was born on October 6, 1923 in London, England. He was the son of Americans, Lowell Thomas Sr., a prominent writer, broadcaster, and traveler, and Frances \\"Fran\\" (n√©e Ryan) Thomas. He graduated from the Taft School in 1942 and went on to Dartmouth College, where he was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter), before joining the United States Army Air Corps.Source: Taft Bulletin 2009; \\"Angel of Denali\\" In 2011, The Taft School honored him with the Horace D. Taft Alumni Medal and Citation of Merit. Career In 1949, Thomas and his father were invited by the Tibetan government to make a film there with the hope that their reports would help persuade the U.S. government to defend Tibet against the Chinese. The trip lasted 400 days, and the father and son were the last Westerners to reach Lhasa before the Chinese invasion and occupation. CBS did not broadcast the resultant film, Expedition to Lhasa, Tibet, until years later, but his book about the expedition, Out of This World, published in 1950 became a bestseller.Source: Taft Bulletin 2009, \\"Angel of Denali\\" In 1960, after the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet was given refuge in India, he wrote the book The Silent War in Tibet. \\"Mr. Thomas describes the brutal Chinese Communist invasion of Tibet beginning in 1950...\\" and about the armed Tibetan resistance by citizens and lamas which began in the mid 1950s. He told the Anchorage Daily News, \\"I guess it was the greatest adventure I ever had.\\" In 2006, the Dalai Lama bestowed the International Campaign for Tibet's Light of Truth Award on Lowell Jr and referred to him as \\"one of the grandfathers of modern day Tibet.\\" In 1954, Thomas and wife Mary Taylor Pryor, known as \\"Tay\\", flew a Cessna 180 around much of the world, logging over 50,000 miles. They wrote about it in their book Our Flight to Adventure. Move to Alaska The Thomases moved to Alaska in 1958 where they would remain for the remainder of their lives.A survivor of the 1964 Alaska earthquake was Mrs. Thomas who with her two children just escaped when their house was torn in half and landslide down. She wrote about her experience in the July 1964 issue of National Geographic Magazine; sadly two children of her neighbor were killed when their house was destroyed After his political career, Thomas returned to flying, owning and operating Talkeetna Air Taxi and flying a Helio Courier for research and documentary work as well as flying climbers to and from Denali's Kahiltna Glacier and in the Alaska Range. He remained an active pilot into his 80s. Among other appearances, in 1958 he appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show To Tell the Truth. In 1962, he narrated a children's recording, \\"The Story of Mr. Globe\\" which was produced by Replogle Globe, Inc in Chicago, Illinois. From January 1967 until December 1974, he represented District E in the Alaska Senate as a Republican. He left the State Senate to become the 3rd lieutenant governor of Alaska under Governor Jay Hammond. Long a resident of Alaska, he was known for his interest in the now-defunct Naval Arctic Research Laboratory based in Barrow, Alaska, currently the home of I·∏∑isaƒ°vik College. Much as his father had done he ventured into the harsh environment of the ice islands where research was done by scientists on the Arctic Ocean and its atmosphere including the Auroras. He published his adventure in National Geographic in 1965 as well as numerous other productions and publications, including a movie on king crab in the Aleutian Islands. Legacy and awards The Thomases were generous philanthropists, and were involved in the building of the biathlon training facility above Girdwood, the Thomas Planetarium at the Anchorage Museum, and the Thomas Center for Senior Living at St. Mary's Episcopal Church where he and Tay were long-time members and supporters. In 1995, he was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the National Parks Conservation Foundation, and in 2004 the Alaska Conservation Foundation awarded him with a lifetime achievement award as well.

The story is told from the perspective of a middle-aged special agent named Giraut. Earth Made of Glass examines religious extremism when two different cultures are forced into proximity. Plot summary Giraut and Margaret, now married, are sent on a diplomatic mission to the politically turbulent planet Briand, a distant Outer Sphere colony cut off from the rest of humanity for centuries until instantaneous travel became possible with the springer. Not only is Briand a very hot, high gravity planet, but the oppressive environment is matched by the increasing hatred between the two proud local cultures which have been forced to live in close proximity as a result of a volcano disaster --the Tamil Mandalam culture of New Tanjavur (based on an interpretation of Sangam literature) and the Maya culture that has been forced to live in the slum of Mayatown and the newly-grown city of Yaxkintulum after the destruction of their native Kintulum (based on an interpretation of pre-Columbian Maya civilization), have strained relations to the point that the Council of Humanity fears that full-scale war or ethnic cleansing may envelop Briand. Giraut and Margaret are given orders by Shan, their Office of Special Projects supervisor, to find the real power brokers of each culture in order to defuse the headline-grabbing daily ethnic attacks and steer the planet clear of all- out war. They must do this under the nose of Ambassador Kiel, a high ranking ambassador from Earth on Briand, who believes strengthening elected government officials is the only way to address a crisis. Giraut and Margaret arrive as their marriage is falling apart, but focus on their work and establish contact with key Tamil people. They are assigned a Tamil assistant, Kapilar, with whom they both spend a lot of time. They are at first unable speak directly to the reclusive Mayans, except for Tz'iquin, the Mayan contact in New Tanjavur. After a small mob attacks Paxa Prytanis, another secret agent sent by the Office of Special Projects, an invitation by the Maya comes unexpectedly. Giraut, Kapilar and Tz'iquin travel to Yaxkintulum in the latter's flying yacht, as the Mayans have officially refused to adopt the springer as well as other technological conveniences, and rely on simple subsistence farming in order to preserve their cultural heritage. Giraut meets Tz'iquin's grandfather, Pusiictsom, the most powerful and influential priest in Yaxkintulum, who, despite being in charge of the traditionally conservative Center Temple, is a reformer working on reconciliation with the Tamils behind the scenes. A plan is put into motion where Pusiictsom's nephew is raised to the position of prophet under the name \\"Ix,\\" with a plan to move to Yaxkintulum and start a cult movement of tolerance, modernization and truth about the founding of the two cultures. The plan calls for the new cult to be brutally oppressed by Mayan authorities, and Giraut, Kapilar, Ix and Tz'iquin stage an escape to New Tanjavur. Through a series of public appearances, Ix begins to recruit Mayans and some Tamils to his cult. He starts dating Auvaiyar, a notable and famously attractive Tamil critic several years his junior who had previously been involved with Tz'quin, Kapilar and Kannan, a deeply bigoted Tamil critic and poet who heads the avant-garde movement and hopes to create a Fourth Sangam. The rumor that Ix has an affair with a Tamil causes mass riots, which Ix unexpectedly ends by confessing in public, despite Pusiictsom's protests, that his prophecy began as a ploy by his family, the Peccaries. Tz'iquin breaks into tears during his uncle's speech, revealing to Giraut his jealousy at his uncle's upcoming marriage to his former girlfriend. Just prior to Ix's next speech, however, Auvaiyar is found dead, her heart and lungs missing. Ix reacts calmly to the discovery, and decides to show the corpse to the crowd during his speech. Giraut and Kannan bring her body to the central plaza, before the temple of Murukan where Ix was going to wed Auvaiyar. As the prophet speaks to the mixed Tamil/Mayan crowd, he uses his pain, her murder and his forgiveness to whoever did it as a starting point for reconciliation between the two cultures. Tz'iquin comes forth, confesses Auvaiyar's murder (saying that he ate her heart, as Tohil is known to do), and shoots his uncle in the head with a maser. Kannan goes on a murderous rampage against the Mayans as a full-scale race war erupts. Giraut and Kapilar run back to the Embassy, where the former is ordered to evacuate it immediately. Almost everyone in the embassy is evacuated through springers to Earth, but Ambassador Kiel is captured by Tamils, and Kapilar refuses to go, choosing instead to join the fighting to honor his Vellala heritage. Giraut, Margaret and Shan watch the civil war unfold from a space station in the Inner Sphere. Mayan forces invade New Tanjavur through Pusiictsom's secret springer, an attack that the Peccaries had been planning for at least a year. Illegal anti- matter weapons are used by both sides, completely destroying both Yaxkintulum and New Tanjavur. The habitable areas of Briand are devastated, and with no springers left intact, the planet becomes isolated from the rest of humanity until a springer ship can arrive in several decades' time. Giraut finds out from Margaret that she had been having an affair with Kapilar since the mission began, and was ordered to not break it off by his friend and boss Shan, who hoped he could acquire valuable intelligence through Kapilar. The failure of the Office of Special Projects on Briand forces the secretive agency into the limelight, and they brace for public scrutiny and oversight. Giraut opts to take his one-year-long leave on the Hedon culture of S√∂derblom to try to salvage his marriage and to get away from Shan, but after that one year, he wants back into the Office of Special Projects to continue the important mission of integrating humanity to provide a united front for possible alien contact.

The most obvious such points for colonization are those in the Earth‚ÄìMoon and in the Sun‚ÄìEarth systems. Although it would generally take days or weeks to reach the latter with current technology, it would be possible to generate energy from sunlight at them nearly continuously since they would, due to their considerable distance from Earth, be shaded from the Sun only seldom and then only shortly. Earth‚ÄìMoon A diagram showing the five Lagrange points in a two-body system, with one body far more massive than the other (e.g. Earth and Moon). In this system ‚Äì will appear to share the secondary's orbit, although they are situated slightly outside it. The only two stable Lagrange points are and . Lagrange points are stable if the mass of the larger body is at least 25 times the mass of the secondary body.. The Earth is over 81 times the mass of the Moon. The L5 Society was founded to promote settlement by building space stations at these points in the Earth Moon system. An station would have a number of important functions due to its stationary position between the Earth and Moon. It is in an excellent location to monitor and coordinate communications among various missions on the nearside of the Moon. A vessel launched from L1 could reach any place on the Moon within a few hours to a day. This would make it ideal for crisis management if an emergency occurred on the Moon. Furthermore, it could serve as a way station, especially once built up, and would probably be used to handle tourists and casual visitors to the Moon. A station like this could also serve as a repair center for ships moving throughout the Solar System. The point, on the far side of the Moon, is completely shielded from Earth by the Moon so radio telescopes placed there would receive much less interference than existing telescopes. Of course, since the Moon is tidally locked, any colony on the far side of the Moon has this same benefit; a lunar facility, however, would suffer from Moonquakes. Both L1 and L2 require active stationkeeping since neither is fully stable (they are saddle points on the energy landscape). Colonies at the and positions would have the advantage of being stable without any need for stationkeeping, and could be used as a waypoint for travel to and from cislunar space. In addition, they would significantly reduce the delta-v (velocity change) needed to move from one to another, or to enter or leave Earth orbit, an important drawback of any lunar surface station, which demands high energy expenditure to escape and a comparable or greater amount to soft- land. Sun‚ÄìEarth Contour lines of the effective potential illustrate the five Lagrange points of the Sun‚ÄìEarth system The L1 position is useful for solar observations since it is near Earth but in constant sunlight. It could also be useful for collecting solar power. Conversely, the L2 point is perpetually in the shadow of Earth, and as such offers a prime location for observing the outer planets or deep space. L4 and L5 colonies could be used as waypoints in space travel, to expand the practical launch window for travel to and from Earth and the other planets. These positions are useful for colonies as they are stable without any need for stationkeeping. Disadvantages Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere. The solar wind flows from left to right. The risk of proton exposure from the solar wind as well as the health threat from cosmic rays would be significant. The Earth's magnetosphere protects against solar storms but provides little protection from the more energetic cosmic radiation‚Äîthe Earth's atmosphere protects us from that. In the Earth‚ÄìMoon system, the orbit of colonies at L3‚ÄìL5 would take them outside the protection of Earth's magnetosphere for approximately two-thirds of the time (as occurs with the Moon). Colonies at L1 (located between Earth and the Moon) would experience this to a lesser degree, whereas L2 (located beyond the Moon) would experience this to a greater degree and all of them would be exposed to the little-understood plasma sheet of the magnetotail.The Moon and the Magnetotail - Tony Phillips (2008) In the Sun‚ÄìEarth system, L1 and L3‚ÄìL5 are all outside the protection of Earth's magnetosphere. L2 periodically transfers from within the magnetotail, plasma sheet, and solar wind, depending on the intensity and direction of the solar wind. Solar storm shielding would only be needed occasionally and it would also be easier to protect against in a shelter settlers could retreat to during a major storm. Cosmic radiation doses build up more slowly over years of exposure, and would need a couple of meters or more of shielding. Designs for space habitats usually supply this with an external shield of regolith or other materials.

Together with Gasparo da Salo and Giovanni Paolo Maggini, Rogeri was one of the major makers of the Brescian school. The Rogeri family is not to be confused with the Rugeri family of Cremona, also an important family of violin makers. Quotes \\"Rogeri is believed to have been born in Bologna but moved to Cremona, where he was apprenticed to Nicolo Amati. By 1675 Rogeri had moved again, this time to Brescia. He fused the neatness of construction that he had learned from Amati with the slightly elongated f-holes and C-bouts of his Brescian predecessors, and was able to combine the best elements of the Cremonese and Brescian schools. He reached his peak as a craftsman from about 1690 and his violins based on Amati's Grand Pattern are generally considered his best. By 1690 he was aided by his son Pietro Giacomo, who was a skilled assistant, and no doubt helped with the production of some lesser instruments, which often have unpurfled backs. The Rogeri workshop also produced a number of fine cellos that again demonstrate the benefit of a Cremonese education.\\"--Four Centuries of Violin Making by Tim Ingles (as summarised on Cozio.com) References * Category:1640s births Category:1710s deaths Category:Luthiers ","title":"Giovanni Battista Rogeri"},{"id":"10151244","text":"Henry Allan may refer to: *Henry William Allan (1843‚Äì1913), Canadian politician, merchant and produce dealer *Henry Allan (painter) (1865‚Äì1912), Irish painter *Henry Allan (footballer) (1872-1965), Scottish footballer *Henry Allan (cricketer) (1846‚Äì1926), Australian cricketer *Henry William Allan (rugby union) (1850‚Äì1926), Scottish rugby player See also *Henry Allen (disambiguation) *Harry Allan (disambiguation) *Harry Allen (disambiguation) *Harold Allen (disambiguation) ","title":"Henry Allan"},{"id":"10151257","text":"Silver Vision was an English video production and distribution label owned by Clear Vision Ltd. From 1988 to 2012, the label was the official licensee for WWE Home Video in Europe. Clear Vision's headquarters were based in Enfield, Middlesex, England. History Silver Vision had exclusive distribution rights to the WWE Tagged Classics range, a unique series of DVD's that were exempt from well-documented legal restraints imposed by federal lawsuits initiated by the World Wide Fund for Nature in 2002. The lawsuits prohibited the referencing and use of all versions of the World Wrestling Federation logo and the initials \\"WWF\\", with only the DVD cover art and menu screens of the \\"Tagged Classics\\" displaying the World Wrestling Entertainment logo and the initials \\"WWE\\". In July 2012, WWE came to a new agreement with the World Wide Fund for Nature which allowed the WWE to no longer censor any of the WWF logos and the spoken initials of \\"WWF\\", however, WWE cannot use any WWF logos in the present day, except in archival footage. Silver Vision parted ways with WWE on 31 December 2012, with nWo: The Revolution being the labels final WWE release. On 19 November 2012, it was announced that FremantleMedia Enterprises would be the new WWE Home Video distributor for the United Kingdom and Europe. Clear Vision also distributed Gaiam, Gormiti, Marvel Animation, NBA and UFC DVD's at retail outlets and through its website. Shortly after losing distribution rights for WWE Home Video, Clear Vision took over as distributor for TNA Home Video in the United Kingdom and Europe.

Her first novel, Mothers and Other Lovers, won a Betty Trask Award in 1993, and her third, Sleep with Me (2005), was adapted for television. Early life Much of her childhood was spent in the south-west of England. At the age of 10, she moved with her family from Somerset to Jordan Manor, an isolated, six-bedroom thatched Devon long house set within of land in a Dartmoor valley. She was rather isolated and she occupied her time reading and writing. Her works written as a teenager were rejected by publishers, but she was convinced she would be an author. Briscoe's parents took her out of primary school at the age of ten and arranged for her to be home-schooled by an unqualified teacher at a nearby farm. Many of the lessons were out-of-doors on Dartmoor. At the age of 13 years she returned to mainstream schooling at King Edward VI Community College, the local secondary school in Totnes, where she specialized in English in the sixth form. Career Briscoe attended University College London before working for several years as a freelance journalist. Her short stories have featured in several anthologies, and she has contributed widely to publications that include The Guardian, The Independent, The Observer, and The Sunday Times and broadcasting on BBC Radio 4. Her first novel Mothers and Other Lovers, in which a teenage girl tries to escape from a stultifying rural life, only to fall in love with her mother's new female friend, won a Betty Trask Award. Briscoe spent a lot of time in New York researching her second novel, Skin, a runner-up for the Encore Award. This explored the plastic surgery and psychological toll taken on women by the beauty industry. Briscoe's third novel, the psychological thriller Sleep With Me, published in July 2005, is according to author and critic Jonathan Coe \\"a beautifully written and emotionally candid novel which also happens to be a page-turner.\\" It has been published in several languages and shortlisted for the Prince Maurice Award. Sleep With Me was adapted for ITV Drama by Andrew Davies and starred Adrian Lester, Jodhi May, and Anamaria Marinca. Her fourth novel, You, was published in July 2011, and after being selected as a Kindle \\"daily deal\\" on 2 December 2011, went to the top of the Amazon Kindle best-seller ranking for that day.

The conference existed from the 1983‚Äì84 school year through the 1991‚Äì92 school year. Originally announced in 1983, the conference was formed by charter members Butler, Dayton, DePaul, Detroit, Evansville, Loyola (Chicago), Notre Dame, and Xavier. Although the conference was to offer competition in cross country, softball, swimming, tennis, and volleyball, the conference was created primarily as a basketball conference. With the exception of Butler and Dayton, all charter members' women's basketball teams were already competing at the NCAA Division I level; Butler and Dayton upgraded their teams from NCAA Division II and commenced competition in the conference's second season.

As late as 1860, 10,000 softwood logs a year were being floated north to the sawmills at Ticonderoga. Hardwoods from the range went to feed the iron forges on Lake Champlain.

The first school district in Alden was formed in 1870. Open Enrollment began at Alden-Conger during the 1990-1991 school year. Roughly half of the students that attend are open-enrolled students from other districts. Bus routes bring in students from Albert Lea, Kiester, New Richland, and Freeborn.  Renovations  The initial school was a three story building. The area where the football field, playgrounds, and baseball field are now used to be a cow pasture owned by a farmhouse located down the street from the school. There were also a fifth grade classroom and a sixth grade classroom located across the street from the school. Most of the second floor of the old school housed a home economics classroom. The workshop on the first floor was later replaced by the library/media center. The Alden United Methodist Church, which was once located next to the school, was removed in order to create a staff parking lot. In 1939, the school put together a fundraiser in order to add floodlights to the football field. The fundraiser was a success, and the lights were added. July of 2009 saw the addition of the LeVerne Carlson Fitness Center, which is still in use today. In 2016, an addition was added to the north end of the building with a new elementary entrance, office, and classrooms. As of 2020, the most recent addition to the school has been a garage for the vans and the custodial machinery.  Staff  Many generations of families have worked at Alden High School, including: Tara Roberts and Kayla Roberts, Stephanie Hallman and Stu Potter, Sam Hintz and Wes Hintz, Tanya Hemmingsen and Courtney Janzig, Farrin and Janet Bremseth and Emily Stadheim, as well as Warren Greenfield and Linnea Peterson. The Guanella family has had a big part in the staff of the school as well. Elwood Guanella was the superintendent of Alden, and his wife, Alvina Guanella, was an elementary teacher. Their son, Joe Guanella, later became the superintendent of Alden. Joe's daughter-in-law, Carolyn Guanella, currently works in the school kitchen. Many staff changes have occurred in recent years. The position of the staff librarian was removed, and there has been some turnover in the English, Math, Physical Education, Band, and World Language departments.  Sports History  In 1939 Alden-Conger had its first year of baseball. During the same year, the football team didn't lose a single home game, leaving them with five wins and three losses. In 1940 track started with the first coach, Mr. H. Johnson. The previous school mascot, the Blackhawks, changed in 1987 and became the Knights when the teams paired up with Freeborn High School. Alden-Conger has not had a wrestling team, but students can join the team in Albert Lea.  Football  In 1946, the football team were undefeated during the Gopher Conference. They also were the Border League Champions in 1963. Then, in 1978, the Alden-Conger Blackhawks brought home a Class C State Championship. Later, they were Section 1 Champions of 1986. The next year, they made it one game away from state. On September 13th, 2014, Alden-Conger broke a 25 game losing streak against Heron Lake Okabena. The last win before that was in 2011. Alden-Conger combined with Glenville Emmons High School during the 2018-2019 school year. The next year, ACGE went 0-9 in scoring. 2019-2020 also saw the addition of Casey Soost as the head football coach. The team switched from a 9 man team to an 11 man team. At the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year, the first game was cancelled due to the Covid-19 Coronavirus.  Basketball  Alden-Conger Freeborn lost in the section finals vs. Rushford Peterson in 1988. The last time that the girl's basketball team went to state was in 1996-1997. The Alden-Conger team has been combined with the Glenville Emmons team since 2018. As of 2020, Chris Johansen is the men's Leading Scorer for Alden-Conger. His career point record is 1564 total points. During the 2020-2021 season, the MSHSL board approved the Maximized Winter Season with 30% reduction in contests (with a maximum of two per week), allowing three contests in the last two weeks for Covid-related rescheduling.  Trap Shooting  Alden-Conger joined the Minnesota State High School Clay Target League in 2012. Before that, FFA members had been competing in fall invitationals hosted by other FFA chapters across southern Minnesota. It was 3 FFA members -- Tommy Geesman, Nick Johannsen and Tyler Koenen that pushed to start the Clay Target League at Alden-Conger. They were looking for spring trap shooting competitions. The Freeborn Gun Club and the School Board were petitioned, and approval was given. The Clay Target League in Alden-Conger is unique in that students from 6-12 grades are allowed to join, as opposed to just the high school students. The Alden-Conger team has had 7 students named to the MSHSCTL All-State Team. In 2019, the team placed 3rd at the National High School Clay Target Championship in Mason, MI. The Alden-Conger team had 10 students that competed, split into team one and team two. Team one included Dylan Kohler, Mike Huper, Erik Warmka, Caleb Prange, and Ryan Hanson. On the first day, the team ended up 7th out of hundreds of teams around the United States. On the second day, the team gave an outstanding performance and pushed their rank up to third place. That same year, Caleb Prange was in the top 100 shooter in the state during the MSHSL state shoot. In 2020 Ann Huper took 2nd place for the IA-Conference 4 in the spring.  Supermileage  The Supermileage program began in 1992. Students in grades 7-12 can join, and as of 2020 it is currently helmed by Amy Wallin. The Alden-Conger team has taken part in several national competitions. They have been to London three times(2016, 2017, 2019), Italy once(2017), Sonoma, CA twice, Detriot, MI three times, and Huston, TX three times. In 2016, the Alden-Conger team finished in first place in the Urban Concept Diesel category at the Shell Eco-Marathon in Detroit. This earned the team their first trip to London to compete in the first-ever Drivers World Championship. Driver Isaac Sorensen made a last- second pass of American rival Mater Dei to earn 3rd place in the world. The team has also achieved several first place finishes in the State Supermileage competition at Brainerd, MN.

Hack watches are used on ships for astronomical sights for navigation and to synchronize the actions of personnel who may not be in direct communication (for example, personnel engaged in a military mission). For navigational purposes, the hack watch is synchronized with the ship's marine chronometer. The use of a hack watch makes it easier to take sights, as the chronometer is normally in a fixed position in a ship ‚Äì below decks and in gimbals to keep it level and protect it from the elements, while the hack watch is portable and can be carried on deck. Though not as accurate as the chronometer, the hack watch is accurate enough to be satisfactory over the relatively short time period between setting it from the chronometer and taking the sight. For mission synchronization, several hack watches can be set alike, then set going at the same moment.

Originally from Chicago, he received an undergraduate education in mathematics, physics and economics at the University of Chicago (AB 1977). He lived in France for ten years from his early twenties and has since been based in London. Life Bodanis was born and brought up in Chicago, Illinois, and read mathematics, physics and history at the University of Chicago. In his early twenties he moved to Paris, where he began his career as a foreign correspondent for the International Herald Tribune. A move to the South of France followed, and he then split his time between France and London, combining writing with stints as a science presenter on 1980s ITV show, the Wide Awake Club. In 1986 Bodanis had his first commercial authorial success with The Secret House: 24 Hours in the Strange & Wonderful World in Which We Spend Our Nights and Days, which reached no 5 on The New York Times Best Seller list and established him as a popular science writer. This book introduces Bodanis‚Äôs \\"microphotography\\" writing style, in which the author takes a worm's-eye view perspective that allows him to observe many obscure and complex phenomena of everyday life. Bodanis moved to the UK full-time in the late 1980s, combining writing with teaching social sciences at St Antony's College, Oxford, consulting for the Royal Dutch Shell Scenario Prediction unit, and speaking engagements including at conferences and Davos. In 2001 he published E=mc2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation which was translated into 20 languages, and longlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize for non-fiction. In 2005, it was made into a documentary for Channel 4, and aired on PBS under the name Einstein's Big Idea. In 2009, E=mc2 was made into a ballet by the Birmingham Royal Ballet, under director David Bintley, and won the South Bank Award for best British Dance of the year. Electric Universe: How Electricity Switched on the Modern World followed in 2006, and won the Royal Society Prize for Best Science Book of the Year. Bodanis caused some controversy by pledging to donate his prize to the family of the late government scientist, Dr David Kelly. In 2006 Bodanis published Passionate Minds, the story of a brilliant but forgotten French scientist, √âmilie du Ch√¢telet, and her intellectual love affair with Voltaire. Passionate Minds was the BBC‚Äôs Book of the Week on Radio 4 in June 2006, and featured on the cover of The Economist.

In many ways they are analogous to ocean tides. Atmospheric tides can be excited by: *The regular day‚Äìnight cycle in the Sun's heating of the atmosphere (insolation) *The gravitational field pull of the Moon *Non-linear interactions between tides and planetary waves. *Large-scale latent heat release due to deep convection in the tropics. General characteristics The largest-amplitude atmospheric tides are mostly generated in the troposphere and stratosphere when the atmosphere is periodically heated, as water vapor and ozone absorb solar radiation during the day. These tides propagate away from the source regions and ascend into the mesosphere and thermosphere. Atmospheric tides can be measured as regular fluctuations in wind, temperature, density and pressure. Although atmospheric tides share much in common with ocean tides they have two key distinguishing features: # Atmospheric tides are primarily excited by the Sun's heating of the atmosphere whereas ocean tides are excited by the Moon's gravitational pull and to a lesser extent by the Sun's gravity. This means that most atmospheric tides have periods of oscillation related to the 24-hour length of the solar day whereas ocean tides have periods of oscillation related both to the solar day as well as to the longer lunar day (time between successive lunar transits) of about 24 hours 51 minutes. # Atmospheric tides propagate in an atmosphere where density varies significantly with height. A consequence of this is that their amplitudes naturally increase exponentially as the tide ascends into progressively more rarefied regions of the atmosphere (for an explanation of this phenomenon, see below). In contrast, the density of the oceans varies only slightly with depth and so there the tides do not necessarily vary in amplitude with depth. At ground level, atmospheric tides can be detected as regular but small oscillations in surface pressure with periods of 24 and 12 hours. However, at greater heights, the amplitudes of the tides can become very large. In the mesosphere (heights of ~ 50-100 km) atmospheric tides can reach amplitudes of more than 50 m/s and are often the most significant part of the motion of the atmosphere. The reason for this dramatic growth in amplitude from tiny fluctuations near the ground to oscillations that dominate the motion of the mesosphere lies in the fact that the density of the atmosphere decreases with increasing height. As tides or waves propagate upwards, they move into regions of lower and lower density. If the tide or wave is not dissipating, then its kinetic energy density must be conserved. Since the density is decreasing, the amplitude of the tide or wave increases correspondingly so that energy is conserved. Following this growth with height atmospheric tides have much larger amplitudes in the middle and upper atmosphere than they do at ground level. Solar atmospheric tides The largest amplitude atmospheric tides are generated by the periodic heating of the atmosphere by the Sun - the atmosphere is heated during the day and not heated at night. This regular diurnal (daily) cycle in heating generates thermal tides that have periods related to the solar day. It might initially be expected that this diurnal heating would give rise to tides with a period of 24 hours, corresponding to the heating's periodicity. However, observations reveal that large amplitude tides are generated with periods of 24 and 12 hours. Tides have also been observed with periods of 8 and 6 hours, although these latter tides generally have smaller amplitudes. This set of periods occurs because the solar heating of the atmosphere occurs in an approximate square wave profile and so is rich in harmonics. When this pattern is decomposed into separate frequency components using a Fourier transform, as well as the mean and daily (24-hr) variation, significant oscillations with periods of 12, 8 and 6 hrs are produced. Tides generated by the gravitational effect of the sun are very much smaller than those generated by solar heating. Solar tides will refer to only thermal solar tides from this point. Solar energy is absorbed throughout the atmosphere some of the most significant in this context are water vapor at (‚âà0-15 km) in the troposphere, ozone at (‚âà30 to 60 km) in the stratosphere and molecular oxygen and molecular nitrogen at (‚âà120 to 170 km) in the thermosphere. Variations in the global distribution and density of these species result in changes in the amplitude of the solar tides. The tides are also affected by the environment through which they travel. Solar tides can be separated into two components: migrating and non- migrating. Migrating solar tides Figure 1. Tidal temperature and wind perturbations at 100 km altitude for September 2005 as a function of universal time. The animation is based upon observations from the SABER and TIDI instruments on board the TIMED satellite. It shows the superposition of the most important diurnal and semidiurnal tidal components (migrating + nonmigrating). Migrating tides are sun synchronous - from the point of view of a stationary observer on the ground they propagate westwards with the apparent motion of the sun. As the migrating tides stay fixed relative to the sun a pattern of excitation is formed that is also fixed relative to the Sun. Changes in the tide observed from a stationary viewpoint on the Earth's surface are caused by the rotation of the Earth with respect to this fixed pattern. Seasonal variations of the tides also occur as the Earth tilts relative to the Sun and so relative to the pattern of excitation.Global Scale Wave Model UCAR The migrating solar tides have been extensively studied both through observations and mechanistic models.GSWM References Non-migrating solar tides Non-migrating tides can be thought of as global-scale waves with the same periods as the migrating tides. However, non-migrating tides do not follow the apparent motion of the sun. Either they do not propagate horizontally, they propagate eastwards or they propagate westwards at a different speed to the sun. These non-migrating tides may be generated by differences in topography with longitude, land-sea contrast, and surface interactions. An important source is latent heat release due to deep convection in the tropics. The primary source for the 24-hr tide is in the lower atmosphere where surface effects are important. This is reflected in a relatively large non-migrating component seen in longitudinal differences in tidal amplitudes. Largest amplitudes have been observed over South America, Africa and Australia.Hagan, M.E., J.M. Forbes and A. Richmond, 2003: Atmospheric Tides, Encyclopedia of Atmospheric Sciences Lunar atmospheric tides Atmospheric tides are also produced through the gravitational effects of the Moon.. Lunar (gravitational) tides are much weaker than solar thermal tides and are generated by the motion of the Earth's oceans (caused by the Moon) and to a lesser extent the effect of the Moon's gravitational attraction on the atmosphere. Classical tidal theory The basic characteristics of the atmospheric tides are described by the classical tidal theory.Chapman, S., and R. S. Lindzen, Atmospheric Tides, D. Reidel, Norwell, Mass., 1970. By neglecting mechanical forcing and dissipation, the classical tidal theory assumes that atmospheric wave motions can be considered as linear perturbations of an initially motionless zonal mean state that is horizontally stratified and isothermal. The two major results of the classical theory are * atmospheric tides are eigenmodes of the atmosphere described by Hough functions * amplitudes grow exponentially with height. Basic equations The primitive equations lead to the linearized equations for perturbations (primed variables) in a spherical isothermal atmosphere:Holton, J. R., The Dynamic Meteorology of the Stratosphere and Mesosphere, Meteor.

Oberheide, On large-scale wave coupling across the stratopause , Appendix A2, pp 113-117, University of Wuppertal, 2007. yields expressions for the latitudinal and vertical structure of the tides. Laplace's tidal equation The latitudinal structure of the tides is described by the horizontal structure equation which is also called Laplace's tidal equation: : {L} {\\\\Theta}_n + \\\\varepsilon_n {\\\\Theta}_n = 0 with Laplace operator : {L}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\mu} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{(1-\\\\mu^2)}{(\\\\eta^2 - \\\\mu^2)} \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\mu} \\\\right] - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta^2 - \\\\mu^2} \\\\, \\\\left[ -\\\\frac{s}{\\\\eta} \\\\, \\\\frac{(\\\\eta^2 + \\\\mu^2)}{(\\\\eta^2 - \\\\mu^2)} + \\\\frac{s^2}{1-\\\\mu^2} \\\\right] using \\\\mu = \\\\sin \\\\varphi , \\\\eta= \\\\sigma / (2 \\\\Omega) and eigenvalue : \\\\varepsilon_n = (2 \\\\Omega a)^2 / gh_n. \\\\, Hence, atmospheric tides are eigenoscillations (eigenmodes)of Earth's atmosphere with eigenfunctions \\\\Theta_n, called Hough functions, and eigenvalues \\\\varepsilon_n. The latter define the equivalent depth h_n which couples the latitudinal structure of the tides with their vertical structure. General solution of Laplace's equation Figure 2. Eigenvalue Œµ of wave modes of zonal wave number s = 1 vs. normalized frequency ŒΩ = œâ/Œ© where Œ© = 7.27 x 10‚àí5 s‚àí1 is the angular frequency of one solar day. Waves with positive (negative) frequencies propagate to the east (west). The horizontal dashed line is at Œµc ‚âÉ 11 and indicates the transition from internal to external waves . Meaning of the symbols: 'RH' Rossby-Haurwitz waves (Œµ = 0); 'Y' Yanai waves; 'K' Kelvin waves; 'R' Rossby waves; 'DT' Diurnal tides (ŒΩ = -1); 'NM' Normal modes (Œµ ‚âÉ Œµc) Longuet-Higgins Longuet-Higgins, M.S., The eigenfunctions of Laplace's equations over a sphere, Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc, London, A262, 511, 1968 has completely solved Laplace's equations and has discovered tidal modes with negative eigenvalues Œµns (Figure 2). There exist two kinds of waves: class 1 waves, (sometimes called gravity waves), labelled by positive n, and class 2 waves (sometimes called rotational waves), labelled by negative n. Class 2 waves owe their existence to the Coriolis force and can only exist for periods greater than 12 hours (or ŒΩ ‚â§ 2). Tidal waves can be either internal (travelling waves ) with positive eigenvalues (or equivalent depth) which have finite vertical wavelengths and can transport wave energy upward, or external (evanescent waves) with negative eigenvalues and infinitely large vertical wavelengths meaning that their phases remain constant with altitude. These external wave modes cannot transport wave energy, and their amplitudes decrease exponentially with height outside their source regions. Even numbers of n correspond to waves symmetric with respect to the equator, and odd numbers corresponding to antisymmetric waves. The transition from internal to external waves appears at Œµ ‚âÉ Œµc, or at the vertical wavenumber kz = 0, and Œªz ‚áí ‚àû, respectively. Figure 3. Pressure amplitudes vs. latitude of the Hough functions of the diurnal tide (s = 1; ŒΩ = -1) (left) and of the semidiurnal tides (s = 2; ŒΩ = -2) (right) on the northern hemisphere. Solid curves: symmetric waves; dashed curves: antisymmetric waves The fundamental solar diurnal tidal mode which optimally matches the solar heat input configuration and thus is most strongly excited is the Hough mode (1, -2) (Figure 3). It depends on local time and travels westward with the Sun. It is an external mode of class 2 and has the eigenvalue of Œµ‚àí21 = ‚àí12.56. Its maximum pressure amplitude on the ground is about 60 hPa. The largest solar semidiurnal wave is mode (2, 2) with maximum pressure amplitudes at the ground of 120 hPa. It is an internal class 1 wave. Its amplitude increases exponentially with altitude. Although its solar excitation is half of that of mode (1, ‚àí2), its amplitude on the ground is larger by a factor of two. This indicates the effect of suppression of external waves, in this case by a factor of four.Volland, H., \\"Atmospheric Tidal and Planetary Waves\\", Kluwer Publ., Dordrecht, 1988 Vertical structure equation For bounded solutions and at altitudes above the forcing region, the vertical structure equation in its canonical form is: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 G^{\\\\star}_n}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\, + \\\\, \\\\alpha_n^2 \\\\, G^{\\\\star}_n = F_n(x) with solution G^{\\\\star}_n (x) \\\\sim \\\\begin{cases} e^{-\\\\alpha_n x} & \\\\text{:} \\\\, \\\\alpha_n^2 < 0, \\\\, \\\\text{ evanescent or trapped} \\\\ e^{i \\\\alpha_n x} & \\\\text{:} \\\\, \\\\alpha_n^2 > 0, \\\\, \\\\text{ propagating}\\\\ e^{\\\\left( \\\\kappa - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right) x} & \\\\text{:} \\\\, h_n = H / (1- \\\\kappa), F_n(x)=0 \\\\, \\\\forall x, \\\\, \\\\text{ Lamb waves (free solutions)} \\\\end{cases} using the definitions * \\\\alpha_n^2 = \\\\kappa H /h_n - 1/4 * x=z/H * G^{\\\\star}_n = G_n \\\\, \\\\varrho_o^{1/2} \\\\, N^{-1} * F_n(x)= - \\\\frac{\\\\varrho_o^{-1/2}}{i \\\\sigma N} \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} (\\\\varrho_o J_n). Propagating solutions Therefore, each wavenumber/frequency pair (a tidal component) is a superposition of associated Hough functions (often called tidal modes in the literature) of index n. The nomenclature is such that a negative value of n refers to evanescent modes (no vertical propagation) and a positive value to propagating modes. The equivalent depth h_n is linked to the vertical wavelength \\\\lambda_{z,n}, since \\\\alpha_n / H is the vertical wavenumber: : \\\\lambda_{z,n} = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi \\\\, H}{\\\\alpha_n} = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi \\\\, H}{ \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\kappa H}{h_n} - \\\\frac{1}{4}}}. For propagating solutions (\\\\alpha_n^2 > 0), the vertical group velocity : c_{gz,n}=H \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\sigma}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_n} becomes positive (upward energy propagation) only if \\\\alpha_n > 0 for westward (\\\\sigma < 0) or if \\\\alpha_n < 0 for eastward (\\\\sigma >0) propagating waves. At a given height x=z/H, the wave maximizes for : K_n = s\\\\lambda + \\\\alpha_n x - \\\\sigma t = 0. For a fixed longitude \\\\lambda, this in turn always results in downward phase progression as time progresses, independent of the propagation direction. This is an important result for the interpretation of observations: downward phase progression in time means an upward propagation of energy and therefore a tidal forcing lower in the atmosphere. Amplitude increases with height \\\\propto e^{z/2H}, as density decreases. Dissipation Damping of the tides occurs primarily in the lower thermosphere region, and may be caused by turbulence from breaking gravity waves. A similar phenomena to ocean waves breaking on a beach, the energy dissipates into the background atmosphere. Molecular diffusion also becomes increasingly important at higher levels in the lower thermosphere as the mean free path increases in the rarefied atmosphere.Forbes, J.M., et al., J. Geophys. Res., Space Physics, 113, 17, 2008 At thermospheric heights, attenuation of atmospheric waves, mainly due to collisions between the neutral gas and the ionospheric plasma, becomes significant so that at above about 150 km altitude, all wave modes gradually become external waves, and the Hough functions degenerate to spherical functions; e.g., mode (1, -2) develops to the spherical function P11(Œ∏), mode (2, 2) becomes P22(Œ∏), with Œ∏ the co-latitude, etc. . Within the thermosphere, mode (1, -2) is the predominant mode reaching diurnal temperature amplitudes at the exosphere of at least 140 K and horizontal winds of the order of 100 m/s and more increasing with geomagnetic activity.Kohl, H. and J.W. King, J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 29,1045, 1967 It is responsible for the electric Sq currents within the ionospheric dynamo region between about 100 and 200 km altitude.Kato, S.J., Geophys. Res., 71, 3211,1966 Effects of atmospheric tide The tides form an important mechanism for transporting energy from the lower atmosphere into the upper atmosphere, while dominating the dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Therefore, understanding the atmospheric tides is essential in understanding the atmosphere as a whole. Modeling and observations of atmospheric tides are needed in order to monitor and predict changes in the Earth's atmosphere (see ).

The station currently airs a country music format and is branded on- air as Pure Country 99. The station is owned and operated by Bell Media which also owns sister station CFLY-FM. History CKLC, along with its sister station CKLC-FM, began operations in 1953 at 1380 on the AM dial as an affiliate of the CBC's Dominion Network and remained with the network until it dissolved in 1962. The call letters are taken from Kingston's nickname, the \\"Limestone City\\". Some of its earliest alumni include newscaster Allan Saunders (Sandzelius), Al Boliska as morning man, and disk jockeys Buddy Guilfoyle and Ron Bertrand. The original station manager was John Bermingham. 1380 CKLC started broadcasting in AM Stereo in the summer of 1985. In 2001, CKLC changed from its adult contemporary format in favour of a national sports radio network The Team. In August 2002, after just over a year on the air, then-owner CHUM Limited reversed their decision on the Team format and CKLC moved to an adult standards format as \\"All time favourites\\". In April 2007, CKLC applied to move to the FM band at 98.9 MHzBroadcasting Notice of Public Hearing CRTC 2007-6 and was given approval by the CRTC on August 28, 2007.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-334, Conversions to FM band and licensing of a new radio station to serve Kingston, CRTC, August 28, 2007 CKLC-FM began broadcasting a test signal on 98.9 in October 2007, with an announcement that \\"Kingston's newest radio station\\" will be launching either \\"soon\\" or \\"in the weeks to come\\". The test signal included classic alternative rock music. The test announcements featured the voice of CHUM-FM's Darren B Lamb. On November 29, 2007, after a short test period, CKLC made the flip from AM to FM. The new CKLC-FM tower was to be installed on the same land as the 1380 AM transmitter site located on Wolfe Island. Due to safety concerns, the construction could not commence on the new 500' FM tower while the 4 175' AM towers remained on and standing. So for the first several weeks on air, CKLC-FM broadcast from a temporary 1 kW transmitter on the old AM STL tower attached to the transmitter building. Once the main transmitter was completed, the station powered up to its full authorized power of 15,000 watts. In 2007, CHUM Limited was acquired by CTVglobemedia. Before CHUM was purchased, the company had applied to the CRTC to convert CKLC to 98.9 MHz with an average effective radiated power of 8,700 watts. On August 28, the Commission approved that application. Former logo as 98.9 The Drive (2007-2019) On November 29, 2007, CKLC launched its FM signal and flipped from easy listening to alternative as 98.9 The Drive. CKLC 1380 left the air in December without ever simulcasting the new CKLC-FM. The AM had authorization to simulcast the FM for three months. On May 27, 2019, CKLC started stunting with a wide range of music. The next day, the station flipped to country music as Pure Country 99, joining all other Bell Media- owned country stations in adopting the \\"Pure Country\\" brand that day. In January 2020, the station attracted press attention when, in the midst of a controversy around the underrepresentation of women in country music, it committed to playing a 50/50 balance of male and female country artists for one week.Ted Raymond, \\"50/50 vision: Kingston‚Äôs Pure Country 99 playing equal split of female and male artists\\".

The Convent Gallery's origins date back to the 1860s gold rush, home to the Gold Commissioner, and then known as 'Blarney Castle'. The Catholic Church purchased the building in the 1880s for the local parish presbytery, where it was home to the priest for ten years. In 1891 Archbishop Thomas Joseph Carr of Melbourne envisaged a \\"source of light and edification\\" for the Central Victorian community of Daylesford, Victoria. In 1892, the building was deemed appropriate for nuns and boarders and the Holy Cross Convent and boarding school for girls was opened. It was the first Victorian establishment outside of Melbourne by the Presentation Sisters. In 1904 the new chapel was completed and in 1927 the parlour, dormitory and music rooms were added. The convent lacked adequate heating and required a large amount of upkeep, inside and out. In the 1970s it was decided that more suitable accommodation should be found for the nuns. The school was closed in 1973 and at the suggestion of the head nun Sister Mary Agatha Murphy, the building was presented in 1975 by the parish of St Peter's to the wider community of Daylesford for its use as a Community Center for arts and education under the direction of a Committee of Management. By the end of 1977, 28 local groups were using it every week with an average weekly attendance of 250 people. It was sold in 1988, needing a great deal of repair and restoration. It was sold to Tina Banitska, a well-known local artist and ceramicist. The building retains many of its Victorian architectural features, and is located on the slope of Wombat Hill overlooking the Central Highlands twin towns of Daylesford and Hepburn Springs. The Convent now houses eight individual galleries, featuring new local and international artists every 8 weeks, the original restored chapel, a museum with the history of the building set up by the nuns themselves, retail selling one-off clothing and jewellery pieces, pottery, local wines and produce, a Mediterranean style cafe\`, New York style penthouse apartment, two glass fronted architecturally designed function rooms, Daylesford's first world class wine bar, scenic views and of picturesque gardens.

Early years Lucey was born in Los Angeles, California to the parents of John Joseph and Marie Lucey on March 16, 1891. He began his college education at St. Vincent's College and completed the rest at St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park in 1912. Robert completed his graduate studies at North American College in Rome and in 1916, received his doctorate in Sacred Theology at the University of the Propaganda in Rome. On May 14, 1916 Robert Lucey was ordained a priest in the Church of St. Apollinaris in Rome. Archbishop Cepetelli, Patriarch of Constantinople and Vice Regent of Rome conducted the ordination. Lucey returned to Los Angeles where he held a series of positions that would serve as experience as a bishop.Williams, p. 361.  Years as a Pastor: The Californian Years  During the next five years in Los Angeles, Father Lucey was assistant pastor of several parishes which included St. Vibiana's Cathedral, Immaculate Conception Parish, Immaculate Heart of Mary Parish, and St. Anthony's in Long Beach. It was in Los Angeles that he gained numerous opportunities that helped him gain experience and knowledge in matters of social doctrine between the church and state. Among the positions that he held were Chaplain of the Newman Club at the University of Los Angeles and Diocesan Director of Catholic Charities (1921‚Äì1925), President of the California Conference of Social Work (1923‚Äì24), director of Catholic Hospitals for the Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego (1924‚Äì1934), and member of the Executive Board of the California State Department of Social Welfare (1924‚Äì1930) appointed by the governor of California. The Catholic Church in Rome had plans for him as he was appointed Bishop of Amarillo on February 10, 1934 by Pope Pius XI. These plans included specific ways to educate social doctrine to the community on matters of faith and social justice. Father Lucey received this opportunity in Amarillo and San Antonio, Texas.Williams, p. 362. Years as a Bishop One may argue that Lucey's years in California were formative years in propagating Catholic doctrine in society. As a bishop he created several institutions and vehicles that left a strong imprint in Texas that lasted even till this today. On March 1, 1934, after Archbishop Amleto Cicognani, Apostolic Delegate to the U.S., consecrated him bishop at St. Vibiana's Cathedral in Los Angeles he began to work on ways to bring the community aware of the Catholic Church in Amarillo. To better inform readers on Catholic news in the U.S. and around the world he established a newspaper called the Texas Panhandle Register. To bridge the gap between parish priests and lay people he either created or supported organizations such as Catholic Action, a lay ministry group, created the Diocesan Council of Catholic Women, and constructed the first parish in Amarillo to serve the needs of the African-American community. However, bigger plans were needed as he was next appointed the second Archbishop in San Antonio, Texas to serve the community in 1941. On January 23, 1941 Pope Pius XII appointed Bishop Lucey as Archbishop of San Antonio. His installation, again presided over by Archbishop Amleto Cicognani, took place at the Cathedral of San Fernando on March 27, 1941. The first ten years of Archbishop Lucey in San Antonio proved busy yet fruitful because a variety of work was accomplished in so short a time. Indeed, so much work was done that he may be labeled as \\"The Great Laborer\\" not only for his belief in social justice but the work done on an average day. In San Antonio, Archbishop Lucey was able to implement many programs and initiatives again with the goal of better informing the community that the Catholic Church had a place for the betterment of society. As he relocated the archdiocesan headquarters on 230 Dwyer Avenue, he organized the Catholic Welfare Bureau, the Catholic Action Office, and Council of Catholic Men. That same year he supported the sponsorship of a summer school of social justice for the clergy. The next year he created another Catholic newspaper called the Alamo Register (which still exists today under the name Today's Catholic). Finally, Lucey, who was very much concerned with parochial schools, appointed Father John L. Morkovsky as archdiocesan superintendent which was one factor that led to the increase of enrollment of children in Catholic schools. Archbishop Lucey's involvement however, did not only extend to communications but programs aimed at the needy, sick, and destitute.Williams, p. 363. As mentioned earlier social action was an important piece of Lucey's agenda for San Antonio. This may be seen in the numerous hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics that were designed to specifically assist the needy such as Yorktown Memorial Hospital, the Czech Catholic Home for the Aged, and the Huth Memorial Hospital which included the latest technological equipment at the time. Lucey also created 29 clinics throughout Southwest Texas which served 39,000 patients at one time. Finally, he cooperated in the establishment of the founding of the Patrician Movement which helped rehabilitating drug using juvenile youths and created Project Equality in 1965, whose aim was to provide equal pay and wages to blue collar workers.Williams, p. 363-64.  Fair Wage Projects in San Antonio: Gymnasium at St. Cecilia's Catholic Church  San Antonio would be the test to implement fair wages to any construction project in the archdiocese. Archbishop Lucey corresponded with Father Balthasar Jan√°ƒçek at St. Cecilia's Catholic Church over the construction of a new gymnasium throughout 1962-65. The gymnasium would not only benefit the parish but the growing community on the south side of San Antonio. Working with a local construction company, J.J. Falbo Construction Co., the archdiocese was able to pay a \\"proper decent wage\\" to any individual who worked under the archdiocese. Correspondence from Rev. Balthasar Janacek to Rev. Charles Grahmann, January 24, 1968, ST. Cecilia files, AASA. Several correspondences between Fr. Jan√°ƒçek and Lucey reveal the contents of any negotiations between a company and the archdiocese. For example, Lucey insisted that Falbo provide evidence of workmen's compensation, employer's liability, bodily injury, and automobile bodily injury before they proceed with the building project. Furthermore, a letter between Jan√°ƒçek and Lucey during the last phase of the project shows us the extent which Lucey was involved in the project. The correspondence reveals that Falbo had not hired a steel company under the supervision of the trades council in San Antonio. In the end the company did show evidence of paying an even higher wage than the union pay rate. Lucey was thus fully aware of what occurred with any project done in the diocese of San Antonio.Rev. Balthasar Janacek to Rev. Charles Grahmann, AASA.  Last Years in San Antonio  On the July 4, 1969, Archbishop Lucey retired as Archbishop of San Antonio at the age of seventy- eight. His retirement stemmed with disagreements between himself and local priests within the Archdiocese over how priests should become involved in politics. As a result, the Vatican instructed Lucey to retire. He served as bishop for twenty-eight years. On August 1, 1977 the former archbishop died of age. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery a place that he himself had acquired in northeast Bexar County to build the cemetery.Williams, p. 365.

It existed from 1815 until approximately 1851.  Beginning  Begun in Zanesville, Ohio at the South West corner of 3rd and Market Streets. It was chartered 13 May 1815 with Isaac Van Horne as President and his son in law Dr. John E. Hamm as Secretary. They made glass bottles with the Eagle and Masonic Symbols.  Perspective  Some websources have it as the earliest glass company in Ohio. However, there were clearly other earlier glass makers in Ohio, but few if any of these ever reached the incorporation stage. Much of the early glass industry was sole proprietorships, and the nature of early Ohio Industry was such that almost all of the really early glass makers left few records. Such was the nature of the craft that it was a rarity for the early glass makers to be able to read or write. However John Hamm and Isaac Van Horne, were unlike the average early Ohio glass manufacturers, both literate. They also had fairly deep pockets and were members of the State and local government. As such they went into the enterprise mostly in the way of the modern businessman, as entrepreneurs, rather than as workers. The company was later known as The Ohio Valley Glass Company. Several examples of the bottles manufactured at the Ohio Glass Company can be found on the web as of 2007.  Sources  * Y Bridge City \\"The Story of Zanesville and Muskingum County, Ohio\\".

These four individuals are Wang Magus, Yang Forest, High Amiable, and Li Resounding; each of them are renowned as superiormen. These four superior men would later be personally recruited by Grand Old Master Wen Zhong in an attempt to put an end to the threat of King Wu. Wang Magus Wang Magus is seen with a deep blue scholarly uniform, long black hair, and an easeful complexion. Once Wang Magus arrived at the Western Foothills, he told Baby Tooth the three consentions and left. At a later point, following his return to the Western Foothills, Wang Magus became enraged over Baby Tooth's refusal to obey his words. Before Wang Magus could lay his sword upon Baby Tooth, Nezha quickly jumped in the way and engaged in a duel. With Yang Forest's assistance, Wang Magus was able to once again pursue Baby Tooth, this time within the sky. While riding through the clouds atop his great beast, Wang Magus unleashed his Earth Slashing Pearl technique to send Baby Tooth tumbling down to the valley below. As Wang Magus was about to finish off Baby Tooth, he heard Superiorman Broad Altruist singing a song. Once Wang Magnus approached Broad Altruist, Broad Altruist ordered Wang Magus not to kill Baby Tooth (for he would never be able to hear the end of the Investiture of the Gods Register if were to do so). Wang Magus, believing Broad Altruist to be cocky, charged at him with his blade; which was immediately parried by Jinzha, Broad Altruist's student. Once Broad Altruist bound Wang's throat, feet, and waist with golden bands, Jinzha beheaded Wang Magus in one swift slash of his sword ‚Äî effectively putting an end to Wang Magus's life. Yang Forest Yang Forest is seen in a monk-style white gown, with a face black ringed as charcoal. Yang Forest also has bushy blond hair and a braided golden beard. Following Baby Tooth's refusal to obey, Yang Forest teamed up with Wang Magus in battle against Nezha. If Wang Magus found any opening, Yang Forest stood ready to unleash his Sky Opening Pearl technique upon Nezha. With great skill, Yang Forest also sent the interfering Yellow Flying Tiger tumbling to the ground. Following the death of Wang Magus, Yang Forest personally vowed ultimate revenge. The following morning, Yang Forest and his two remaining superiormen allies duelled it out against both Jinzha and Nezha. Yang Forest (who saw High Amiable killed instantly by Baby Tooth's Devil Beating Whip), was now furious. Once Yang Forest charged at Baby Tooth to avenge the death of his comrade, Jinzha immediately appeared and bound Yang Forest with his Seven-Treasure Golden Lotus. Yang Forest quickly fell dead after being pierced through the stomach by Jinzha's sword. High Amiable High Amiable is seen with a complexion of indigo blue, two protrusive buck teeth, bright red knotted hair, and a bright royal red robe. During the first attack upon Baby Tooth, High Amiable unleashed his skills against Good Lob the Lobster. When Yang Forest was being bound to death by Good Lob, High Amiable immediately launched himself into the air and unleashed his Coalesce Pearl technique (a technique that instantly sent Lobster's head askew). Upon hearing of the death of Wang Magus, High Amiable also expressed his anguish, and battled against Baby Tooth the following morning. However, High Amiable was instantly struck in the head by Baby Tooth's Devil Beating Whip, and thus died instantly. Li Resounding He was supposedly the strongest member of the Foursome of Nine Dragon Island. In appearance, Li Resounding had long flowing black hair and beard, a face of plum redness, and a long pale yellow gown. During the first attack upon the Western Foothills, Li Resounding assisted Wang Magus against Baby Tooth. Following the second encounter against Baby Tooth, Li Resounding, in great anger, battled it out against both Jinzha and Nezha. With demonic fervor following the death of all three of his allies, Li Resounding now stood as a lone warrior that possessed the determination to fight to the death. Due to the sudden assistance of Zhang Cassia and Gale Woods, Li Resounding was able to retreat atop his large beast after suffering a few minor wounds. While still being pursued by Baby Tooth, Li Resounding barely avoided death from Baby Tooth's whip. After escaping by flying atop his beast, he arrived at a neighboring secluded hideout to plan his next move. With great inner anguish, Li Resounding spoke the words, > \\"How can I possibly face my other friends on the Nine Dragon Island now that > the four of us have become just a little me! We each had more than a > thousand years of training and study. How could we be so stupid as to get > involved in such a senseless fight? I think I'd better go to see the Grand > Old Master who, after all, involved us in this mess!\\" Soon thereafter, Muzha, the second brother of Nezha, suddenly appeared before Li Resounding and told him of his allegiance. Li Resounding, in a fit of rage, charged at Muzha with his sword. Unfortunately, Resounding was soon struck down and died.

He was elected in 1922 and again in 1928. Birth and education Judge Horton was born January 4, 1878, the son of James Horton, Sr. and Emily Donelson. His mother was the great-niece of former President of the United States Andrew Jackson. His family bible shows he was born in Limestone County, AL. At some point during his childhood he moved to Athens, Alabama. He had no formal education until the age of eight or nine. He was a sickly child and had to rely on his mother's care. Nothing has been known about Judge Horton's high school education. The next record of him appeared when he enrolled in Vanderbilt University's medical studies program. His decision to become a doctor was influenced by his father. After a year Horton decided that medicine was not for him and transferred to Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee and gained his B.A. in 1897. At Cumberland School of Law he earned his Bachelor of Law degree in 1899. Horton's clerked for his father, a Probate Judge, before entering into a private practice. Career Judge Horton served one term in the Alabama State Legislature from 1910‚Äì1914. Following this he served in the Alabama State Senate. His term as a Senator was cut short when a chancery court opening appeared, which he took. He eventually left his seat on the chancery court, returning to his old law practice and farming his land. He continued with this life for some time, before being elected judge of the Eighth Circuit Court, as noted above. It was during his second term that Judge Horton got the most important case of his career: the re-trials of the Scottsboro Boys. Scottsboro Boys re-trials Judge Horton presided over the re-trials of the Scottsboro Boys. Both the prosecution and defense agreed with his choice. Numerous comparisons were made in the media to his resemblance to former President Abraham Lincoln. He was represented as the perfect man for the job. However, much to the prosecution's dismay, Judge Horton issued a startling rebuke to the State's case after a conviction and death penalty were handed down against Haywood Patterson. To quote: After handing down this statement, Judge Horton was taken off the case by the Alabama Supreme Court. In his place, the State put Judge William Washington Callahan. End of career The year after Judge Horton's statement, he lost his re-election bid to Aquilla Griffith. He then retired to his farm and tried to live a quiet life. This was disturbed in March 1934, when he sold the Tennessee Valley Authority his land so that they could build the Wheeler Dam. Using the proceeds of this sale, Judge Horton and his wife, Anna Hobbs Horton, pooled their money and bought of land in Greenbrier, Alabama. He then took his wife's family home in Athens apart piece-by-piece and reassembled it in Greenbrier. At Greenbrier, he devoted his time to farming. He raised cotton, corn, and soybeans, as well as the largest herd of Aberdeen-Angus cattle in Alabama. He died in March 1973 at 95. He is immortalized in a bronze plaque on a wall just outside of the courtroom where he heard the Scottsboro cases: > So far as the law is concerned it knows neither native nor alien, Jew nor > Gentile, black nor white. This case is no different from any other. We have > only to do our duty without fear or favor. A statue of Judge Horton, made of bronze, stands on the west side of the Limestone County courthouse. Several members of the local community initiated the Judge Horton statue project, which was completed and unveiled in October 2017. ReferencesExternal links *Profile of Judge James Horton.

Strang was originally recruited from East Albury after one season in the Ovens and Murray Football League as part of a major country recruiting drive by the Tigers, who were eager to break a run of Grand Final losses to Collingwood dating back to 1927. In just his second VFL game, his 14 goals kicked against North Melbourne in 1931 still stands to this day as the record for the most goals kicked by a Richmond player in a single game, and as the youngest player to kick ten or more goals in a VFL game, at just 18 years and 300 days old. In his first season Strang‚Äôs brilliant overhead marking, in spite of exceptionally wet weather for much of the winter, brought him sixty- eight goals with long drop kicks. In 1932, Strang struggled severely in another rainy winter, but from the time he kicked a goal after the bell to end an eleven match winning streak by Carlton, his brilliant marking asserted itself, most notably in a wonderful display on a dry ground in the second- semi-final. 1933 saw Strang begin to suffer from injuries later in the season. After he had seemingly returned to his best form with ten goals at Arden Street in the thirteenth round, Strang damaged a thigh when playing for the Tigers against the Ballarat League between the fifteenth and sixteenth rounds,‚ÄòRichmond‚Äôs Inter-State Achievements‚Äô; in The Age, 18 August 1933 and due to knee problems was not at his best when returning for the finals.

Strang in Form‚Äô; in The Argus, 23 April 1934; p. 12 but after one impressive match in the second round against St. Kilda, it was soon discovered that the knee required an operation to repair a slipped disc, and Strang did not play again until the fourteenth round against Carlton. After that, however, the disc incapacitated him once more and he was a passenger on the forward flank by the seventeenth round. These injuries meant Strang left Richmond during 1935. In June 1935, Strang was cleared to Kyneton Football Club where he took over the lease of the Junction Hotel, Kyneton. Strang was captain / coach of the Kyneton Football Club's 1936 premiership team in Bendigo Football League, before returning to Albury as a hotelier in 1937 and playing in Albury Football Club's 1937 premiership team. ‚ÄòChampion Albury Footballer‚Äô; in Albury Banner and Wodonga Express; 11 June 1937 after it was thought he would go back to Richmond.

He earned his doctorate in creative composition from the Eastman School of Music. His teachers included Alfred Swan, Randall Thompson, Walter Piston, Bernard Rogers, Howard Hanson, Alan Hovhaness, and Robert Palmer. During 1964-1965, Davison was placed in the Kansas City (Missouri) Schools as part of the Music Educators National Conference's Contemporary Music Project, where he composed numerous works for band, chorus, and orchestra. He was a friend of Aaron Copland and maintained a correspondence with him. He was also a conscientious objector. Davison's music is generally tonal, strongly melodic, and influenced by such diverse musics as Western classical and Romantic music (particularly the music of Johannes Brahms, Renaissance and Baroque music, Irish music, English country dancing, Anglican church music, and jazz. His music is published by Southern Music Publishing Co., Shawnee Press, and TAP Music Publishing, and his music has been recorded by the CRI, Crystal, Coronet, Encore, and Albany labels.

Superstitions and Traditions, Household Words Etymology Collin de Plancy, in the Dictionnaire Infernal, gives the meaning of his name as 'Wanderer in the Night', but the translation of his name from Breton seems to be cognate to 'John with the Fire' (compare Will o' the Wisp).

Biography  Born in Columbus, Georgia, Freeman received a B.A. in mathematics and philosophy from Duke University in 1973 and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Washington University in 1978. He taught at the University of Minnesota and the Wharton School, and is now Elis and Signe Olsson Professor of Business Administration at the Darden School of the University of Virginia. He is also academic director of the Business Roundtable Institute for Corporate Ethics, and director of the Darden's Olsson Center for Applied Ethics.Freeman's curriculum vitae. Accessed Feb 27, 2013. In 1994 Freeman served as president of the Society for Business Ethics. He is one of the executive editors of the journal Philosophy of Management and he serves as the editor for the Ruffin Series in Business Ethics from Oxford University Press. In 2001 Freeman was awarded the Pioneer Award for Lifetime Achievement by the World Resources Institute and by the Aspen Institute, and in 2005 the Virginia State Council on Higher Education honored him with the Outstanding Faculty Award.  Work  Freeman is particularly known for his work on stakeholder theory originally published in his 1984 book Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach. He has (co)authored other books on corporate strategy and business ethics. Also recently he co-edited standard business textbooks such as The Portable MBA and the Blackwell's Handbook of Strategic Management. His latest book, Managing for Stakeholders, was published 2007.  Stakeholder theory  Stakeholder theory is a theory of organizational management and business ethics that addresses morals and values in managing an organization. It was originally detailed by Freeman in the book Strategic Management: a Stakeholder Approach, and identifies and models the groups which are stakeholders of a corporation, and both describes and recommends methods by which management can give due regard to the interests of those groups. In short, it attempts to address the \\"Principle of Who or What Really Counts.\\" In the traditional view of the firm, the shareholder view, the shareholders or stockholders are the owners of the company, and the firm has a binding fiduciary duty to put their needs first, to increase value for them. However, stakeholder theory argues that there are other parties involved, including governmental bodies, political groups, trade associations, trade unions, communities, financiers, suppliers, employees, and customers. Sometimes even competitors are counted as stakeholders - their status being derived from their capacity to affect the firm and its other morally legitimate stakeholders. The nature of what is a stakeholder is highly contested (Miles, 2012), with several definitions existing in the academic literature (Miles, 2011).  Corporate social responsibility  Corporate social responsibility (CSR) D Wood, 'Corporate Social Performance Revisited' (1991) 16(4) The Academy of Management Review is a form of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model. CSR policy functions as a built-in, self-regulating mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance within the spirit of the law, ethical standards, and international norms. CSR is a process with the aim to embrace responsibility for the company's actions and encourage a positive impact through its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, communities, stakeholders and all other members of the public sphere who may also be considered as stakeholders. The term \\"corporate social responsibility\\" came into common use in the late 1960s and early 1970s after many multinational corporations formed the term stakeholder, meaning those on whom an organization's activities have an impact. It was used to describe corporate owners beyond shareholders as a result of an influential book by Freeman, Strategic management: a stakeholder approach in 1984. Proponents argue that corporations make more long term profits by operating with a perspective, while critics argue that CSR distracts from the economic role of businesses. Others argue CSR is merely window-dressing, or an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful multinational corporations. Anticipation of such concepts appear in a publication that appeared in 1968 \\"Integrated structures in the Italian distribution system,\\" Giuffre Editore, Milan, 1968, pp. VIII / 351 by Italian economist Giancarlo Pallavicini, creator of the \\"Method of the decomposition of the parameters\\" for the calculation of the results does not directly cost of business, regarding ethical issues, moral, social, cultural and environmental.\\"Universal Biographical Encyclopedia\\" Treccani, 2007 edition, Vol. 14, p. 617; \\"Treccani - Portal\\", Social sciences / economics / Biographies; Bancoper Annual Meeting, Bologna, 15.11.2008, Prefect Angelo Tranfaglia, \\"Profit and Social Responsibility\\", p. 12; \\"Finanza e Mercati\\", 3 February 2009, p. 11, Mara Consoli, \\"When ethics becomes a bargain\\"; News Chronicles, CNEL, Rome, 12.01.2009, Adelaide Mochi, \\"Socialis Awards and Corporate Social Responsibility\\" Selected publications Books: * 1984, Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach.

Through his numerous books, articles, and translations of European art texts Pach brought the emerging modernist viewpoint to the American public. He organized exhibitions of contemporary art for New York City galleries of the period. He was also extremely helpful to Arthur B. Davies, president of the landmark exhibition of 1913, the \\"International Exhibition of Modern Art,\\" known as the Armory Show, as well as to one of its founders Walt Kuhn, by bringing together leading contemporary European and American artists. Another original founder Jerome Myers spent over a year supervising the American portion of the show. Pach helped John Quinn and Walter Arensberg gather their collections. He also secured individual works for museums, such as a portrait by Thomas Eakins for the Louvre, and Jacques-Louis David's The Death of Socrates for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Pach's fluency in French, German, and Spanish made it possible for him to understand and interpret the avant-garde ideas developing in Europe and translate them for the English-speaking audience. He was able to communicate personally with many noted artists in Europe and Mexico and mediate between gallery dealers and museum curators on their behalf. His correspondence with major figures in 20th-century art are an important source of information, not only about the artists but about the art world during the first half of the 20th century. Biography Pach was born in New York City on July 11, 1883. His father, Gotthelf Pach, was a prominent commercial photographer who, with his family, ran the New York studio of Pach Bros. They did most of the photographic work for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The young Pach often accompanied his father on museum assignments. In 1903, Pach graduated from the City College of New York with a degree in art. He studied with Robert Henri at the New York School of Art and went abroad to paint with William Merritt Chase in the summers of 1903 and 1904. In 1907, Pach moved to France and became part of the Gertrude and Leo Stein circle, and moved among the Parisian avant-garde, exhibiting with them and writing about their work and new artistic vision. In 1908 he wrote the first article on C√©zanne to be published in the U.S., which appeared in Scribner's Magazine. He also interviewed Claude Monet that year and published an article about him in the same periodical. He helped manage and teach in several of William Merritt Chase's summer art schools in various European locales. Pach was the only American artist to be closely affiliated with the Section d'Or group of artists, including Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Duchamp brothers Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Jacques Villon and others. Pach was responsible for securing loans from these painters for the 1913 Armory Show. Most of the artists in Paris who sent works to the Armory Show knew Pach personally and entrusted their works to him.Laurette E. McCarthy, Walter Pach, Walter Pach (1883-1958), The Armory Show and the Untold Story of Modern Art in America, Penn State Press, 2011 Pach married artist Magdalene Frohberg in 1914, and their son Raymond was born at the end of that year. He began advising Walter and Louise Arensberg on their art collecting and introduced them to Marcel Duchamp in 1915. The following year, with Duchamp and the Arensbergs, he was a major force in the creation of the Society of Independent Artists. In the summer of 1918 Pach taught two classes, including one on modern art, at the University of California at Berkeley. In the summer of 1922 he taught at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he lectured and wrote about Native American art. He helped organize exhibitions and raised money for a museum to be dedicated to the indigenous arts of the Americas. He was also a friend of Jos√© Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera and helped organize the Mexican chapter of the Society of Independent Artists. In 1923 he began an affiliation with New York University, where he taught periodically. While he is not remembered today as a painter, Pach devoted much of his creative efforts to painting. He thought of himself both an artist and a writer, despite advice from friends like art historian Bernard Berenson who urged him to devote his time to writing. His writings include monographs on a wide range of subjects, social commentary on the art world, and a book on museum structures. His first publications included brochures for the 1913 Armory Show, including Odilon Redon, and a book about the work of his close friend Raymond Duchamp-Villon titled A Sculptor's Architecture.Walter Pach, A Sculptor's Architecture, Association of American painters and sculptors, Incorporated, 1913 In 1923, Pach wrote Georges Seurat, a book art historian John Rewald later cited by as an important text on the artist. Masters of Modern Art and a monograph on Duchamp-Villon in French were published the following year. The first solo exhibition of his own art took place in 1925 at Joseph Brummer Galleries, New York. He created a stir in 1928 in the art world with Ananias, or The False Artist, a well-known indictment of opportunistic artists and corruption in the art world. Pach considered Vincent van Gogh a seminal figure in the development of modern art and was the first historian to lecture on him in America. He published his well-received monograph, Vincent Van Gogh, in 1936, and translated the journals of Eug√®ne Delacroix in 1937. His recollections of a life spent in art, Queer Thing, Painting, appeared in 1938. Ingres was published in 1939, as well as Masterpieces of Art, written for the 1939 New York World's Fair, for which he was the exhibition director. His 1948 The Art Museum in America called into question the relevance, responsibility, and future of the American art museum. He long championed the artists of Mexico and published an essay on Diego Rivera in 1951 for the National Museum of Fine Arts, Mexico, for its 50-year retrospective exhibition on the artist. His last book, The Classical Tradition in Modern Art, was published posthumously in 1959. He died on November 27, 1958 in Manhattan, New York City.

Usually worn around the neck, Sensecam is used for the MyLifeBits project, a lifetime storage database. Early developers were James Srinivasan and Trevor Taylor. Earlier work on neck-worn sensor cameras with fisheye lenses was done by Steve Mann, and published in 2001.Intelligent Image Processing, John Wiley and Sons, 2001, 384pCyborg: Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the Wearable Computer, Randomhouse Doubleday, Steve Mann and Hal Niedzviecki, 304p, 2001 Microsoft Sensecam as well as Mann's earlier sensor cameras, and subsequent similar products like Autographer, Glogger and the Narrative Clip, are all examples of Wearable Computing.Wearable Computing, Mads Soegaard, Encyclopedia of Interaction- Design and Human Computer Interaction, Chapter 23 Sensecam photo of King's College, Cambridge SenseCam prototype circa 2003 Wearable neck-worn cameras contribute to an easier way of collecting and indexing one's daily experiences by unobtrusively taking photographs whenever the internal sensor is triggered by a change in temperature, movement, or lighting. The SensecamSenseCam is also equipped with an accelerometer, which is used to trigger images and can also stabilise images so as to reduce blurriness. The camera is usually worn around the neck via a lanyard. The photos represent almost every experience of its wearer's day. They are taken via a wide-angle lens in order to capture an image that is likely to contain most of what the wearer can see. The SenseCam uses a flash memory which has the means to store upwards of 2,000 photos per day as .jpg files, though more recent models with larger and faster memory cards mean a wearer typically stores up to 4,000 images per day. These files can then be uploaded and automatically viewed as a daily movie, which can be easily reviewed and indexed using a custom viewer application running on a PC. It is possible to replay the images from a single day in as little as a few minutes. An alternative way of viewing images is to have a day's worth of data automatically segmented into 'events' and to use an event-based browser which can view each event (of 50, 100 or more individual SenseCam images) using a keyframe chosen as a representative of that event. SenseCams have mostly been used in medical applications, particularly to aid those with poor memory as a result of disease or brain trauma. Several studies have been published by Chris Moulin, Aiden R. Doherty and Alan F. Smeaton showing how reviewing one's SenseCam images can lead to what Martin A. Conway, a memory researcher from the University of Leeds, calls \\"Proustian moments\\",http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm?volumeID=24&editionID;=197&ArticleID;=1805 characterised as floods of recalled details of some event in the past. SenseCams have also been used in lifelogging, and one researcher at Dublin City University, Ireland, has been wearing a SenseCam for most of his waking hours, since 2006, and has generated over 13 million SenseCam images of his life.http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~cgurrin/ In October 2009, SenseCam technology was adopted by Vicon Revue and is now available as a product. There is a wiki dedicated to SenseCam technical issues, software, news, and various research activities and publications about, and using, SenseCam.  Projections  200px Microsoft Research has contributed a device that will aid lifebloggers among several other potential users. SenseCam was first developed to help people with memory loss, but the camera is currently being tested to aid those suffering from serious cognitive memory loss. The SenseCam produces images which are very similar to one's memory, particularly episodic memory, which is usually in the form of visual imagery.Memory SC By reviewing the day's filmstrip, patients suffering from Alzheimer's, amnesia, and other memory impairments found it much easier to retrieve lost memories. Microsoft Research has also tested internal audio level detection and audio recording for the SenseCam, although there are no plans to build these into the research prototypes at the moment. The research team is also exploring the potential of including sensors that will monitor the wearer's heart-rate, body temperature, and other physiological changes along with an electrocardiogram recorder when capturing pictures. Other possible applications include using the camera's records for ethnographic studies in social phenomena, monitoring food intake, and assessing an environment's accessibility for the handicapped.SenseCam Applications  See also  * Lifelog * MyLifeBits * Gordon Bell * Cathal Gurrin * The Circle (Eggers novel) References Further reading  *Microsoft Research Projects: SenseCam *SenseCam: A Retrospective Memory Aid *SenseCam Applications *Vicon Revue *A Personal Perspective on Living Daily Life With A SenseCam *An FAQ About Daily Living With A SenseCam Category:Microsoft Research Category:Ubiquitous computing Category:Wearable computers ","title":"Microsoft SenseCam"},{"id":"10152336","text":"Snowden EP is the first EP by the band Snowden, released in 2005.

Similar images are used in a variety of applications, now including law. Neurolaw is a field of interdisciplinary study that explores the effects of discoveries in neuroscience on legal rules and standards. Drawing from neuroscience, philosophy, social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and criminology, neurolaw practitioners seek to address not only the descriptive and predictive issues of how neuroscience is and will be used in the legal system, but also the normative issues of how neuroscience should and should not be used. The rapid growth of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has led to new insights on neuroanatomical structure and function, which has led to a greater understanding of human behavior and cognition. As a response, there has been an emergence of questions regarding how these findings can be applied to criminology and legal processes. Major areas of current neurolaw research include courtroom applications, legal implications of neuroscience findings, and how neuroscience-related jurisdiction can be created and applied. Despite the growing interest in neurolaw and its potential applications, the legal realm recognizes the substantial opportunity for misuse and is proceeding cautiously with novel research outcomes. History The term neurolaw was first coined by J. Sherrod Taylor in 1991, in a Neuropsychology journal article analyzing the role of psychologists and lawyers in the criminal justice system. See also: After this publication, scholars from both fields began to network through presentations and dialogs, and start to publish books, articles, and other literature about this intersection. Parallel to the expansion of neurolaw, an emergence of neuroethics was developing. The intersection of neurolaw and ethics was able to be better scrutinized by the initiation of the Law and Neuroscience Project by The MacArthur Foundation. Phase I of this project was launched in 2007 with a $10 million grant. The initiative sustained forty projects addressing a multitude of issues, including experimental and theoretical data that will provide further evidence as to how neuroscience may eventually shape the law. The Gruter Institute for Law and Behavioral Research and the Dana Foundation are some of the prominent institutions that receive grants and conduct neurolaw research under this initiative. Neurolaw has also piqued the interests of several universities, such as Baylor College of Medicine's Initiative on Neuroscience and the Law, now known as the national nonprofit called the Center for Science & Law. SciLaw, as the organization is known, seeks to leverage neuroscience, law, ethics, programming, and data science to analyze policies and develop solutions to advance the criminal justice system. Their stated goal is to 'steer social policy in an evidenced-based manner, thereby reducing rates of incarceration and providing innovative options for improving the criminal justice system in a cost effective and humane way'. The University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Center for Neuroscience and Society began in July 2009, and is working towards confronting the social, legal, and ethical inferences of neuroscience. Vanderbilt University created the first dual J.D./PhD in the United States in 2010. Neurocriminology A few important sources have shaped the way that neuroscience is currently used in the courtroom. Primarily, J. Sherrod Taylor's book, Neurolaw: Brain and Spinal Cord Injury (1997), which was used as a resource for attorneys to properly introduce medical jargon into the courtroom and to further develop the implications of neuroscience on litigation. In this book, Taylor also explained the consequences of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals. This United States Supreme Court case resulted in what is now known as Daubert Standard, which sets rules regarding the use of scientific evidence in the courtroom. This standard governs the way that neuroscience evidence can be presented during a court case. Crime prediction Behavioral testing and neuroimaging evidence offer potentially more accurate modalities for predicting human behavior. Developing these tools to be used in criminology would be beneficial particularly in determining criminal sentence length and in assessing risk for which criminals should remain in jail or be released based on prediction of future offenses. Not only could the adaptation of these tools aid in the process of recidivism, but they could also show indications for the need for personal rehabilitation. In light of this information and its potential applications, the legal system seeks to create a balance between punishment and penalties based on the ability to predict additional criminal activity. The Center for Science & Law has developed a suite of mobile and gamified NeuroCognitive Risk Assessments (NCRA) to help steer people to the proper post-conviction rehabilitation programs by harnessing what drives individual decision making. By understanding individual differences in aggression, empathy, decision making, and impulsivity -- without reference to race -- the group states they can build better and fairer inroads to rehabilitation. As a risk assessment, it was found to be as predictive or more so than risk assessments commonly used. Holding consistent with their mission to \\"advance justice\\", the NCRA does not collect race data making for a more fair and unbiased assessment. Insanity defense The tendency of the United States criminal justice system has been to limit the degree to which one can claim innocence based on mental illness. During the middle of the 20th century many courts, through the Durham Rules and the American Law Institute Model Penal Code, regarded impaired volition as legitimate grounds for the insanity defense. However, when John Hinckley was acquitted due to insanity in 1982, a reversal of this opinion occurred, which spurred a narrowing definition of mental illness. Insanity decisions became increasingly based on the M‚ÄôNaghten Rules, which asserted that unless one was able to prove that a mental illness kept him or her from knowing that their actions were wrong, or knowing the disposition of the criminal act, one would not be able to be tried as criminally insane. Contemporary research conducted on the prefrontal cortex has criticized this standpoint because it considers impaired volition as a factor. Many researchers and courts are beginning to consider \\"irresistible impulse\\" as legitimate grounds for mental illness. One of the factors neuroscience has added to the insanity defense is the claim that the brain ‚Äúmade someone do it.‚Äù In these cases, the argument is based on the notion that an individuals decisions are made for them, before they are able to consciously realize what they are doing. Further research on control and inhibition mechanisms will allow for further modifications to the insanity defense. Impaired functioning of the PFC is evidence that a prime factor in mental illness is disrupted volition. Many experiments using fMRI show that one of the functions of the PFC is to bias a person towards taking the more difficult action. This action is representative of a long-term reward, and it is competing with an action that will lead to immediate satisfaction. It is responsible for moral reasoning, including regret. Individual variations that impair the PFC are extremely detrimental to the decision-making process, and give an individual a greater likelihood in a committing a crime he or she would have otherwise not committed. Brain death Injuries or illnesses that lead to a persistent vegetative state have come to the forefront of many ethical, legal, and scientific issues regarding brain death. PDF From the exterior, it is a difficult to know when a patient is beyond hope for recovery, as well as to decide who has the right to end life support. Research initiatives in cognition have helped to develop an understanding of the vegetative state. Research has shown that although a person can be awake and conscious, he or she may not show any signs of awareness or recognition to external stimulation. In 2005, research was conducted on a 23-year-old female who suffered traumatic brain injury from an automobile accident. The woman was declared to be in a vegetative state; after five months she continued to be unresponsive, but brain pattern measurements indicated normal sleep and wake cycles. Using fMRI technology, researchers concluded that she was able to understand external stimuli via activity in specific regions of the brain. Particularly, she exhibited increased activity in the middle and superior temporal gyri similar to the way that a healthy individual would. This positive response revealed potential for medical imaging to be used to understand the implications of brain death, and to help answer legal, scientific, and ethical questions pertaining to individuals in vegetative states. Nootropics Neurolaw also encompasses ethical questions regarding nootropics, or mind-enhancing drugs. Current research suggests that the future may hold powerful medications that can specifically target and alter brain function by bypassing the blood brain barrier. The potential to significantly improve one's concentration, memory, or cognition through drug-use has raised numerous questions on the legality of these substances, and their appropriateness in everyday life. Analogous to the controversy over the use of anabolic steroids in professional sports, many high schools and universities are wary of students eventually using nootropics to artificially boost academic performance. Some of the questions raised regarding the use of nootropics include: * How will these enhancers affect performance gaps between family income classes? * Will it become necessary to use an enhancing drug simply to remain competitive in society? * How does society distinguish between what is an acceptable substance (e.g. caffeine) and an unacceptable substance to alter one's mind? * Do people have the right to experiment with substances to modify their own cognition? Scientists and ethicists have attempted to answer these questions while analyzing the overall effect on society. For example, it is largely accepted that mind-enhancing drugs are acceptable for use on patients diagnosed with cognitive disorders, as in a case of prescribing Adderall to children and adults with ADHD. However, Adderall and Ritalin have also become popular black-market drugs, most notably on college campuses. Students often use them to maintain focus when struggling to complete large amounts of schoolwork, and often become dependent on the effects produced. It is ethically questionable whether individuals who do not need nootropics should use them, and mostly unknown how continued usage could impact the brain chemistry of someone who is using nootropics for non- prescriptive reasons. Current Research Neurolaw advancements depend on state-of-the-art medical technology and grant-funded research. Among the most prominent technologies and disciplines used in neurolaw research are functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and epigenetics.  Epigenetics  Current research is exploring how genetic analysis can be used to assess risk and predict atypical behaviors. Studies have shown links between violent behaviors and a low allele variant of the MAOA gene. Preliminary research suggests that males that have this dysfunctional gene and have experienced childhood abuse are several hundred times more likely to commit a violent crime than those with normal MAOA gene expression. Findings like this have sparked a conversation about 'neuroprediction', or using genetics and neuroimaging modalities to predict criminal behavior and assess individual risk. If the science behind prediction improves, lawmakers will need to decide the role that genetic, neuroanatomical, or neuropathic predictions can play in legal decisions for risk assessment, particularly when a criminal is being sentenced or released.  Neuroimaging  Understanding structural and mechanistic neural dysfunction in criminals can help to determine motives and define criminal responsibility. fMRI is particularly important because it allows for detailed functional mapping of the human brain. fMRI measures blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast, which allows us to view the most active areas of the brain at a given moment based on blood flow. This imaging modality allows researchers to identify and understand complex neural pathways and mechanisms. Relevant mechanisms in neurolaw research are memory, reward, impulse, and deceit circuitry. Neuroimaging modalities can also be used to analyze neuroanatomical structures in terms of size and shape. Researchers are working towards defining the characteristics of healthy, well-functioning brain structures, which may help us better understand the dysfunctions and deficits in atypical, criminal brains. Lie detection The diagram above is an overview of the varying patterns of brain activity detected by fMRI. Yellow highlighted regions are where there is the most activity occurring. TR and CR levels represent \\"telling the truth.\\" LT signals indicate a subject is withholding information. LN signals indicate a subject is making up information. There is potential to use fMRI evidence as a more advanced form of lie detection, particularly in identifying the regions of the brain involved in truth telling, deception, and false memories. False memories are a barrier in validating witness testimonies. Research has shown that when presented a list of semantically related words, participant recollection can often be unintentionally false and additive of words that were not originally present. This is a normal psychological occurrence, but presents numerous problems to a jury when attempting to sort out the facts of a case. fMRI imaging is also being used to analyze brain activity during intentional lies. Findings have shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activates when subjects are pretending to know information, but that the right anterior hippocampus activates when a subject presents false recognition in contrast to lying or accurately telling a truth. This indicates that there may be two separate neural pathways for lying and false memory recall. However, there are limitations to how much brain imaging can distinguish between truths and deceptions because these regions are common areas of executive control function; It is difficult to tell if the activation seen is due to the lie told, or something unrelated. Future research aims to differentiate between when someone has genuinely forgotten an experience and when someone has made an active choice to withhold or fabricate information. Developing this distinction to the point of scientific validity would help discern when defendants are being truthful about their actions and when witnesses are being truthful about their experiences. Neuroimaging criticisms The use of neuroimaging in the legal system creates a very divided audience. Many argue for its potential, while others argue it will not accurately replace human investigation of criminal decision-making processes. Even considering recent research findings, neuroimaging is still inadequately understood. Additional medical factors like age, medication history, diet, and endocrine function need to be considered when viewing an fMRI image, and the sensitivity of the scanner needs to be considered as well. If the person being scanned is moving or inaccurately completing assigned tasks, the images produced will be invalid. Other critics highlight that the image derived from the technology does not display the brain's intentionality. Functional neuroimaging was not intended to calculate volition, and while it may offer insight into the processes that cause behavior, it is debated whether or not the images can objectively narrow in on human reasoning and specific thought processes. These factors make neuroimaging results hard to assess precisely, which is why there is hesitation towards presenting them in court cases. Controversy over the science behind fMRI lie detection entered a Federal courtroom in 2010 with a Daubert hearing concerning its admissibility in a criminal trial. Ultimately, the images were excluded based on doubts about neuroimaging validity. A 2012 appeal of the case failed to change the court's view of the matter. Legal professionals suggest that there are currently too many serious, open questions about the suitability of neuroimaging for legal or other high-stakes uses. Application in practice Neurolaw techniques and policies are slowly entering the legal system due to professional and general public skepticism about its validity. Currently two companies, No Lie MRI and Cephos Corp, offer lie-detection services that utilize neuroimaging. Their services are considered to be a more advanced form of a polygraph test, but are rarely accepted as evidence in the courtroom. PDF Use of neuroimaging evidence for structural and functional analysis varies greatly by geographic region and cultural acceptance of the modality.  Criminal law  In the United States, brain scan results have been increasingly utilized during the sentencing phase of trials, with the rate of cases involving neuroscience evidence doubling from 2006 to 2009. In two instances occurring in California and New York, defendants were able to reduce their sentence of first-degree murder to manslaughter using neuroimaging. Each case presented brain scans suggesting hindered neurological function hoping to mitigate their responsibility in the crime. Brain images were also used in the case of Harrington v. State of Iowa in 2003 as evidence for the defense. However, in the case of Harrington v. State of Iowa, the brain images were solely shown to the judge and not a jury panel, reducing the ability of this case to be used as precedent for utilizing brain imaging as evidence.Church, D. J. (2012). Neuroscience in the Courtroom: An International Concern. William & Mary Law Review, 53(5), 1825‚Äì1854. Retrieved from http://www.antoniocasella.eu/dnlaw/Church_2012.pdf In Mumbai, India, the legal system has taken a more rapid approach in applying neuroscience, and has already incorporated it into criminal convictions. In 2008, an Indian woman was convicted of murder based on strong circumstantial evidence, including a brain scan that suggested her guilt. This conviction was sharply criticized by Hank Greely, a professor of law at Stanford University. Greely contested the scan based on evidence produced by a Brain Electrical Oscillation Signature Profiling test (BEOSP). No scientific peer-review studies had ever been published demonstrating the efficacy of BEOS, raising questions about its reliability in such an important decision. Government and military The United States Military has become increasingly interested in the possibilities of neuroscience research. Brain imaging could help to distinguish between enemy combatants from those who pose no risk, or determine the mental stability of their own soldiers. Nootropic drugs could also be used to enhance the focus and memories of soldiers, allowing for better recognition of dangers and improved performance. However, this has led to questions regarding the personal privacy of soldiers and detainees, and the compliance requirements that may come with performance enhancement. Although the civilian court system is reluctant to use unproven technologies, the military's future use of them may generate controversy over the possible innocence or guilt of enemy combatants. With the advent of novel technological innovations and information in the field of neuroscience, the military has begun to anticipate specific uses for such neuroscience research. However, these approaches, which can alter human cognitive abilities as well as infringe on an individual's right to the privacy of his or her own thoughts, are still innovatory and early in development. Present day treaties, such as the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights and the Chemical Weapons Conventions, address only the use of certain chemical agents and are not regulating the fast-paced evolution of recent advancements in cognitive science research. Due to this ambiguity and the potential of technology misuse, it has become increasingly pressing to address the regulations and ethics needed for neuroscience research. Another area of interest to the military is the use of human enhancement drugs. DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), a Pentagon branch of the United States Department of Defense, is responsible for significant amount of military research and development of technology. With the announcement of the BRAIN Initiative in 2013, DARPA began to support this initiative through a number of programs involving under-researched neuroscience topics like neuromodulation, proprioception, and neurotechnology. A current operation of DARPA is named the Preventing Sleep Deprivation Program, which conducts research on the molecular processes and changes in the brain involved with sleep deprivation, with the ultimate purpose to maximize warfighters‚Äô cognitive abilities, even with sleep deprivation. As a result of this research, sleep deprivation prevention drugs such as Modafinil and Ampakine CX717 have increased in significance. However, because these chemical drugs directly affect natural chemical reactions and receptors in the body, the ethics of their use as well as safety are in question. Cautions and concerns Public opinion of neurolaw is influenced by cultural, political, and media-related factors. Surveys show that the general public does not have a well-formed understanding of neurolaw. Approval seems to depend highly on how the topic is framed, and may even vary depending on partisanship. Due to glorified depictions of forensics labs on popular television shows, brain imaging has faced criticism for having a \\"CSI effect\\". It is possible that some people have a false understanding of forensic science based on inaccurate portrayals. This could lead to them having a stronger opinion about technological evidence or neurolaw initiatives. Neuroscience is still not fully understood. There is not enough evidence of structural and functional relationships to be able to confidently link a brain feature to a criminal behavior or issue. This uncertainty leaves room for misuse of neuroscientific evidence in a courtroom. American professor of law and psychology Stephen J. Morse described the abuse of neuroscience in courtrooms with a pseudo-disease he called \\"Brain Overclaim Syndrome\\". He comments on the idea of people having diminished responsibility or no responsibility for their actions because those actions were caused by \\"the brain\\", in situations where the science could not support such causal claims. He raises the question of whether brains should be blamed for crimes, or the people behind them.Morse, S. (2006). Brain Overclaim Syndrome and Criminal Responsibility: A Diagnostic Note. Retrieved from http://repository.upenn.edu/neuroethics_pubs/28 Law- makers and judges are cautious due to the lack of concrete findings in neurolaw. Before making decisions on how to regulate and utilize neuroscience research in court, law-makers and judges must consider the implications that will come with suggested changes. Neuroimaging and genetic evidence has the potential to be helpful in legal processes and ensure that dangerous criminals stay behind bars, but it also has the potential to be abused in a way that imprisons undeserving parties on purpose or due to negligent use of the science. Although some experts recognize the possibilities and drawbacks of brain imaging, others still completely reject the field. In the future, judges must decide on the relevance and validity of neurological evidence so that it can enter the courtroom, and juries must be open to understanding scientific concepts but not be too willing to place all faith in neuroscience.

Along with Russellosaurus, Dallasaurus is one of the two oldest mosasauroid taxa currently known from North America. This small semi- aquatic lizard measured less than a meter in length, compared to such gigantic derived mosasaurs as Tylosaurus and Mosasaurus, each exceeding 14 meters. Specimens The genus is based upon two partial skeletons recovered from the Arcadia Park Shale (lower Middle Turonian), approximately 15 meters above its contact with the older Kamp Ranch Limestone in Dallas County in north-central Texas. The holotype specimen (TMM 43209-1, Texas Memorial Museum, University of Texas at Austin) consists of an incomplete and disarticulated skull, along with considerable portions of the postcranial skeleton, making up about 80 percent of the animal.\\"Dino-Era Lizard Is Missing Link to Swimming Reptiles, Experts Say\\", National Geographic News, 21 November 2005. The second referred specimen (DMNH 8121-8125, 8143-8149, and 8161-8180, Dallas Museum of Natural History) lacks any skull material and consists entirely of disarticulated postcranial remains. The strata containing these fossils were temporarily exposed during excavations for a housing development, and both sites have now been reburied by construction. The two specimens were discovered about 100 meters from one another; the first was found by an amateur collector, Van Turner, for whom the type species (Dallasaurus turneri) was named.\\"SMU and Dallas Museum of Natural History Announce Missing Fossil Link Dallasaurus\\" , Southern Methodist University, 16 November 2005. The genus is named for Dallas County, where both specimens were found. Anatomy Estimated size, compared to a human. Animated restoration Polcyn and Bell diagnose Dallasaurus as follows: \\"Small, plesiopedal mosasauroid possessing the following autapomorphies: posterior maxillary teeth strongly recurved posteriorly, slightly inflated at the crown and bearing only posterior carinae that is slightly offset laterally; atlas neural arch mediolaterally compressed but not flattened at its base, condylar surfaces irregularly figure-eight shaped; cervical vertebra synopophyses protrude below the level of the ventral edge of the centrum; short, wide fossa excavated immediately below the ventral rim of the cotyle of at least one middle cervical vertebra; hypapophysis anteroventral edge terminating in short projections of irregular length; postglenoid process capped by bony epiphysis bearing a calcified cartilage apex.\\" Bell & Polcyn, Dallasaurus turneri, pp. 179-180. Bell and Polcyn use the term \\"plesiopedal\\" to indicate a \\"conservative ecologically adaptive grade\\" characterized by \\"small size, slightly modified swimming tail and [a] relatively plesiomorphic limb condition\\" compared to more derived mosasauroids. Polcyn and Bell note that plesiopedal mosasauroids tend to be relatively small lizards possessing limbs in which the \\"propodial elements [equals humerus, radius, and ulna] remain elongated, generally constituting one-half or more of the full length of the osseus limb\\",Bell & Polcyn, Dallasaurus turneri, p. 178. as compared to more derived \\"hydropedal\\" mosasaurs in which the propodial elements are stout and have been substantially shortened, constituting less than one-half of the full length of the ossueus limb. While hydropedal mosasaurs were probably entirely aquatic, plesiopedal mosasauroids were still capable of terrestrial locomotion and so likely lived an amphibious lifestyle. Classification Bell and Polcyn have conducted a cladistic analysis of Dallasaurus, concluding that this taxon should be placed within the subfamily Mosasaurinae, \\"well within [the family] Mosasauridae\\", and that, despite its small size and the \\"primitive\\" condition of its limbs, it should not be placed within the paraphyletic family Aigialosauridae.Bell & Polcyn, Dallasaurus turneri, pp. 188-190. Dallasaurus is the sister group to more derived mosasaurine mosasaurs such as Clidastes, Prognathodon, Mosasaurus, and Plotosaurus.

Both are non-commercial, Christian stations owned by Family Life Radio. Family Life Radio began in 1966 with a half-hour Christian program aimed at teenagers airing on WIBM-FM (now WWDK) on 94.1 in Jackson, Michigan. Warren and Char Bolthouse, founders of Family Life Radio, produced the program in a studio in the basement of their home on Jericho Road near the Kibby Road studio of WIBM. WIBM-FM had begun broadcasting in 1955, but was simulcasting WIBM-AM and had very few listeners. Soon Warren and Char Bolthouse convinced Booth Broadcasting, the owners of WIBM, to allow them to program the station full-time. Since few people had FM radios in the mid-1960s, they agreed and Family Life Radio began programming the station from the studio in the middle of the Bolthouse basement. Listenership grew as churches in the Jackson area began to encourage their members to purchase an FM radio and tune in to the broadcasts. As FM radio sales increased, Booth told Family Life Radio that he would resume control of the station programming. Family Life Radio looked to Mason, Michigan, half-way between Lansing and Jackson for the location of its first station. WUNN was founded in the late 1960s as a 1,000 watt daytime only AM station. Family Life Radio began looking into the possibility of adding an FM station in the Jackson area so they could get better coverage in the area and provide programming during the night hours. Otis Meyer donated a piece of property to the station near Albion next to the I-94 freeway. A station license was purchased from WALM-FM who then built a new WALM-FM (now WBXX) on 104.9 in nearby Marshall, Michigan. Soon the tower of WUFN rose on the property and the station began operation in 1971 at 96.7 MHz from a trailer parked on the site. The trailer continued to be used until it was replaced by a Colonial style building in 1991. In December 2003 WUFN increased power from 1,500 watts to 3,200 watts. In 2005 a 36-watt translator began operating on 95.1 in Kalamazoo, Michigan. After trying a Southern Gospel format on WUNN, it was decided to no longer provide separate programming and WUNN began simulcasting WUFN in 2006. WUNN and WUFN were the first two stations in the Family Life Radio network that now includes 41 stations in Michigan, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Kansas, and California. Other Michigan stations are WUGN 99.7 MHz Midland, Michigan and WUFL 1030 kHz in Detroit. WUFN is also simulcasting on WBFN 1400 AM in Battle Creek, which is currently in Clear Channel Communications' Aloha Station Trust and is being gifted to Family Life Radio. Translators In addition to the main station, WUFN is relayed by an additional two translators to widen its broadcast area. NOTE: W260BX lists WUNN-AM 1110 as its primary operating station.

In 2007, thirty-six years after he graduated from high school, the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) recognized Lawless as one of the \\"100 Greatest Players of the First 100 Years\\" of Florida high school football. In 2001, he was inducted into the Charlotte High School Hall of Fame.  College career  Lawless accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Doug Dickey's Florida Gators football team from 1971 to 1974. 2011 Florida Gators Football Media Guide , University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 87, 91, 96, 183 (2011). Retrieved August 30, 2011. As a freshman, he broke his shoulder on his first practice and was moved to offensive tackle when he returned to the team, and eventually to offensive guard, where he arguably became the best pulling guard in Gators history. He was a three-year starter, a second-team All- Southeastern conference (SEC) selection in 1973 and 1974, and a first-team All-American during his senior season in 1974. He also played in the 1975 Chicago College All-Star Game. Lawless returned to the university during the NFL off-season to finish his bachelor's degree in exercise and sport sciences in 1977, and he was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \\"Gator Great\\" in 1978. In one of a series of articles published by The Gainesville Sun in 2006, he was recognized as one of the top 100 Gators (No. 42) of the first 100 years of Florida football.  Professional career  Lawless was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round (forty-fourth pick overall) of the 1975 NFL Draft, also known as the Dirty Dozen draft. Mitch Hoopes and him were the only rookies to earn starting jobs, with Lawless replacing the traded John Niland at left guard and becoming the first team rookie to start in the offensive line (including Super Bowl X) since . At the end of the season, he was named to the NFL All-Rookie team. In , the improved play of Herbert Scott forced him into a platoon role. In , he was moved to right guard but lost the starting job to Tom Rafferty. Injuries to Scott and John Fitzgerald allowed him to start 6 games (4 at left guard and 2 at right guard). The next year, he was back to serving as a messenger guard, alternating mainly with Rafferty. After requesting to be traded, he retired in during training camp and was subsequently traded to the Miami Dolphins for a draft choice (not exercised) on August 19. During his time with the Cowboys, he was a part of three Super Bowl teams, winning Super Bowl XII. The Miami Dolphins released him on September 1, . On October 23, he signed as a free agent with the Detroit Lions, where he played in nine games. He was released on August 31, . On November 17, he was signed by the Miami Dolphins to be a backup behind Bob Kuechenberg for the last five games of the 1981 season. In April , Lawless signed a contract with the Chicago Bears. In May, during the off-season, a 12-foot, 5,000-pound plow-arm fell on his head and neck, causing him to be paralyzed from the neck down for 17 days and ending his professional career. During his seven-season NFL career, Lawless played in eighty-two games, and started in twenty-three of them.  Personal life  Lawless attended the Cowboys alumni reunion and closing ceremony at Texas Stadium in Dallas on December 20, 2008.

Using Walter's profile, forensic sculptor Frank Bender was able to create a bust of List that was accurately aged to reflect the changes in the unseen List's face over the years. This was featured on an episode of America's Most Wanted; the sculpture was so similar to List's current appearance that he was captured the next day. In Lubbock, Texas in 1999, City Police solved the murder of Scott Dunn with Walter's aid. This is a rare case where a conviction was garnered in the absence of a body. The case is chronicled in the book Trail of Blood\\" by Wanda Evans and in the television series Medical Detectives In 2005, the Hudson, Wisconsin Police Department consulted with the Vidocq Society on the 2002 double homicide of Dan O'Connell and James Ellison. With the help of Walter, the Hudson Police Department solved the case. The murderer was Fr. Ryan Erickson, a Roman Catholic priest who was trying to prevent O'Connell from going public with child molestation allegations. Shortly before he could be arrested, Fr. Erickson hanged himself inside the offices of his own church.Walter was personally very confident about solving this case saying, \\"If I were the perp, I would buy any green bananas, because they won't have any time to ripen. Double murder is now 10 years old, Hudson Star-Observer, February 5, 2012 The Drake Case In October 1982, Walter testified in Niagara County (NY) Supreme Court in the double murder trial of Robie J. Drake, who was convicted of killing fellow high school classmates Steven Rosenthal, 18, and Amy Smith, 16, in a \\"lover's lane\\" killing. Shortly before midnight on Dec. 5, 1981, Drake fired 19 rounds from a semiautomatic .22-caliber rifle into a 1969 Chevrolet Nova. He killed Smith with two shots in the back of the head, and shot Rosenthal fourteen times in the face and upper body. With Rosenthal still groaning, Drake admitted he stabbed him in the back with a 71/2-inch hunting knife, according to The Buffalo News. He removed Smith from the car, bit her breasts and tried to sexually assault her with a flashlight. Drake was caught by police at a landfill as he tried to stuff Smith's nude body into the trunk. He was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 20 years to life. In 2003, Walter became an innocent victim of Drake's attempts to get a new trial, when, after 27 years of appeals, Drake was granted a new trial when the U. S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Walter had inflated his resume and committed perjury in the 1982 trial. The American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS) investigated Walter, a longtime member, for wrongdoing. Walter wrote to the AAFS's Ethics Committee that he was \\"flabbergasted and stunned\\" because \\"the Niagara County Prosecutor's Office did not‚Ä¶advise me of the issue and/or make any effort to respond to Drake's contrived and malicious claims‚Ä¶the U.S. Court of Appeals‚Ä¶relied totally upon the false and misleading statements made in Drake's affidavit‚Ä¶without a challenge to the accuracy or authenticity.\\" The AAFS twice investigated Drake's allegations against Walter and found Walter innocent of any wrongdoing. The Vidocq Society, the international pro-bono crime-fighting organization that Walter helped establish, investigated the allegations and also cleared him of wrongdoing. In the course of writing his book on the Vidocq Society, The Murder Room, New York Times-bestselling author Michael Capuzzo investigated the allegations and found them groundless. Capuzzo interviewed Vidocq Society President William Fleisher, a federal agent with the FBI and U.S. Customs for more than 20 years.\\"Richard got a bum deal,\\" Fleisher said. \\"A convicted killer made defamatory stuff up about him and got a court to believe it because nobody bothered to check whether the killer was telling the truth, which is ridiculous. Richard became a victim without a remedy. Courts make mistakes, and this one did.\\" \\"Drake did what criminals do,\\" Walter told Capuzzo in an interview for Capuzzo's book. \\"He lied and tried to take advantage of people and the system. Justice took a holiday in this case, and I ended up with an undeserved scar of war with crime. Occasionally bottom-dwellers in the forensic community will try to exploit Drake's lies on the internet. But I've simply gone on to do some good work while choosing to avoid lawyers and chalk it up to \\"life is not always fair.\\" In May 2010, Drake got his new trial in Niagara County. He was convicted again of the murders of Smith and Rosenthal. This time the judge gave him a longer sentence, two consecutive terms of 25 years to life, \\"which will keep him from parole eligibility for 10 extra years,\\" The Buffalo News reported.

The program started in 1978, and is planned to be completed around 2050, at which point it will be long. The project's name indicates that it is to be carried out in all three of the northern regions: the North, the Northeast and the Northwest. This project has historical precedences dating back to before the Common Era. However, in premodern periods, government sponsored afforestation projects along the historical frontier regions were mostly for military fortification. Effects of the Gobi Desert Map of China and the Gobi desert China has seen of grassland overtaken every year by the Gobi Desert. Each year, dust storms blow off as much as of topsoil, and the storms are increasing in severity each year. These storms also have serious agricultural effects for other nearby countries, such as Japan, North Korea, and South Korea. The Green Wall project was begun in 1978, with the proposed end result of raising northern China's forest cover from 5 to 15 percent, thereby reducing desertification. Methodology and progress The fourth and most recent phase of the project, started in 2003, has two parts: the use of aerial seeding to cover wide swathes of land where the soil is less arid, and the offering of cash incentives to farmers to plant trees and shrubs in areas that are more arid. A $1.2 billion oversight system (including mapping and surveillance databases) is also to be implemented. The \\"wall\\" will have a belt with sand-tolerant vegetation arranged in checkerboard patterns to stabilize the sand dunes. A gravel platform will be next to the vegetation to hold down sand and encourage a soil crust to form. The trees should also serve as a windbreak from dust storms. Measuring success As of 2009, China's planted forest covered more than 500,000 square kilometers (increasing tree cover from 12% to 18%) ‚Äì the largest artificial forest in the world. Of the 53,000 hectares planted that year, a quarter died. In 2008, winter storms destroyed 10% of the new forest stock, causing the World Bank to advise China to focus more on quality rather than quantity in its stock species. Problems If the trees succeed in taking root, they could soak up large amounts of groundwater, which would be extremely problematic for arid regions like northern China. For example, in Minqin, an area in north-western China, studies showed that groundwater levels have dropped by 12‚Äì19 metres since the advent of the project. Land erosion and overfarming have halted planting in many areas of the project. China's increasing levels of pollution has also weakened the soil, causing it to be unusable in many areas. Furthermore, planting blocks of fast-growing trees reduces the biodiversity of forested areas, creating areas that are not suitable to plants and animals normally found in forests. \\"China plants more trees than the rest of the world combined\\", says John McKinnon, the head of the EU-China Biodiversity Programme. \\"But the trouble is they tend to be monoculture plantations. They are not places where birds want to live.\\" The lack of diversity also makes the trees more susceptible to disease, as in 2000, when one billion poplar trees were lost to disease, setting back 20 years of planting efforts. Liu Tuo, head of the desertification control office in the state forestry administration, is of the opinion that there are huge gaps in the country's efforts to reclaim the land that has become desert. At present there are around 1.73 million sq kilometers that have become desert in China, of which 530,000 km2 are treatable. But at the present rate of treating 1,717 km2 per year, it would take 300 years to reclaim the land that has become desert. Relations to climate change China's forest scientists argued that monoculture tree plantations are more effective at absorbing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than slow-growth forests, so while diversity may be lower, the trees purportedly help to offset China's carbon emissions. However, a study released in 2016 finds that wild woodlands are much more effective than monocultural forests in storing carbon dioxide, with more resilient and greater tree health, size, lifespan, and depth of organic matter rich soil. (See List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions) Criticism Gao Yuchuan, the Forest Bureau head of Jingbian County, Shanxi, stated that \\"planting for 10 years is not as good as enclosure for one year\\", referring to the alternative non-invasive restoration technique that fences off (encloses) a degraded area for two years to allow the land to restore itself. Jiang Gaoming, an ecologist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and proponent of enclosure, says that \\"planting trees in arid and semi-arid land violates [ecological] principles\\". The worry is that the fragile land cannot support such massive, forced growth. Others worry that China is not doing enough on the social level. To succeed, many believe the government should encourage farmers financially to reduce livestock numbers or relocate away from arid areas.

He played college football at Michigan State University. Early years Edwards attended Aiken High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he earned All-district honors as a tight end and defensive tackle. He accepted a football scholarship from Michigan State University. He was a backup during his first 2 seasons. As a junior in 1989, in his first season as a starter at weakside linebacker, he finished second on the team in tackles (111) to All- American Percy Snow and tied for the team lead in tackles for loss (11), earning an All-Big Ten honorable-mention. He had 14 tackles against the University of Miami, 13 against the University of Michigan and 14 against the University of Iowa. As a senior, he had 112 tackles (7 for loss), 2 sacks, one pass defensed, 2 forced fumbles and 2 fumble recoveries. Edwards led the Spartans with a single-game career-high 16 tackles in their upset of then-No. 1 ranked University of Michigan. He earned second-team All-Big Ten honors at the end of the year. During his college career, he registered 254 career tackles, 18 tackles for loss, 4 passes defensed and 4 sacks, while helping the Spartans to a 31-14-1 record, two Big Ten titles and a 3-1 bowl game record (including the 1988 Rose Bowl win). Professional career=Dallas Cowboys Edwards was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round (37th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft. Because of his speed and hitting ability, he was moved to strongside linebacker, even though he had a small frame at 6-1 and 225 pounds. On September 25, he was activated from the injured reserve list. He played mainly on special teams and tied for fourth on the team with 10 tackles. The next year, he was second on the team with 15 special teams tackles. In 1993, he became the starter at strongside linebacker after Vinson Smith was traded to the Chicago Bears on August 17. He posted 82 tackles (seventh on the team), 1.5 sacks, one quarterback pressure and 12 special teams tackles. He saw limited action in Super Bowl XXVIII because the Cowboys kept 5 defensive backs on the field for most of the contest. In 1994, he recorded 104 tackles (third on the team), 5 tackles for loss, one sack, 2 quarterback pressures, 3 passes defensed and 9 special teams tackles (tenth on the team). He dislocated his right shoulder in the first quarter of the NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers and was replaced with Godfrey Myles. In 1995, he was third on the team with 109 tackles. In the 90's, the Cowboys organization felt they could find linebackers through the draft, without the need of paying a premium and adversely impacting the salary cap, so they allowed talented and productive players like him, Ken Norton, Jr., Darrin Smith, Robert Jones and Randall Godfrey, to leave via free agency, instead of signing them to long-term contracts. During his 5 seasons with the Cowboys, Edwards helped the team win 3 Super Bowls, playing as a starter in Super Bowl XXVIII and Super Bowl XXX. In 1996 after he left as a free agent, the Cowboys replaced him by signing Broderick Thomas. Minnesota Vikings On February 25, 1996, Edwards signed as a free agent with the Minnesota Vikings, replacing Broderick Thomas and becoming the Vikings highest paid linebacker in franchise history. During training camp Ed McDaniel was injured, so the team was forced to move him to weakside linebacker, where he would have the best year of his career with 122 tackles, 3.5 sacks and one interception. In 1997, he was moved back to the strongside linebacker position, where his production began to decline. On June 2, 1999, he was released for salary cap reasons. In his three years with the Vikings, Edwards started 43 of the 45 games, made 250 tackles, 5 sacks, one interception, 7 passes defensed, 3 forced fumbles and 2 fumble recoveries. Miami Dolphins On June 21, 1999, the Miami Dolphins signed him to a one-year contract, to add depth and experience at the outside linebacker position, while reuniting him with Jimmy Johnson. In training camp he was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat and although he was medically cleared, he decided to stop playing and was released before the season started on August 4. Edwards appeared in 120 regular season games in his career, starting 90 of them. His NFL career statistics include 573 tackles, 7.5 sacks, two interceptions for 54 yards and a touchdown, four fumble recoveries, seven forced fumbles and 19 passes defensed. He also had 50 special teams tackles. Personal life On KTCK AM in Dallas, Edwards is known for an interview he did where he said the words \\"you know\\" an inordinate number of times to the point where it became unintentionally comedic.

Ralph Neely fractured his leg in a motorcycle accident, Don Talbert broke a bone in his foot, and Forrest Gregg was limited in the last season of his 16-year Hall of Fame career. Tom Landry called Liscio on Monday November 15, and he reported to the team on Wednesday to start at left tackle against the Washington Redskins on Sunday.Frederick Daily Leader - Google News Archive Search Liscio played his first game back with his right leg taped from the ankle to the hip and both shoulders hurt. The Cowboys won 13-0, earning first place in the NFC East division. His opponent that day was defensive end Verlon Biggs, who never reached the quarterback. He did not allow a sack in the eight starts during his comeback and the team was undefeated with him at left tackle. He and Alworth were also Super Bowl VI teammates. In that game, Liscio successfully blocked Bill Stanfill, helping Duane Thomas and other running backs register 252 rushing yards.

If the barrier is broken, as by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) in acid solution, acid diffuses back into the mucosa where it can cause damage to the stomach itself. The barrier consists of three protective components sinclair.edu. These provide the additional resistance for the mucosal surface of the stomach. The three components include: * A compact epithelial cell lining. Cells in the epithelium of the stomach are bound by tight junctions that repel harsh fluids that may injure the stomach lining. * A special mucus covering, derived from mucus secreted by surface epithelial cells and Foveolar cells. This insoluble mucus forms a protective gel-like coating over the entire surface of the gastric mucosa. The mucus protects the gastric mucosa from autodigestion by e.g. pepsin and from erosion by acids and other caustic materials that are ingested. * Bicarbonate ions, secreted by the surface epithelial cells.

He enjoyed great authority in foreign trade and industry circles. He accompanied Leonid Krasin to London for the negotiations over the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement. In 1923, Nogin traveled to the United States to arrange a major cotton purchase. While there, he helped the Coolidge administration communicate with Moscow using the code of the Soviet government, in an attempt to establish friendly relations between the two countries.Reform and Revolution: The Life and Times of Raymond Robins, Neil V.

Thornton also subbed for Kenny Ploen when Winnipeg's starting quarterback was injured. He won two Grey Cup games with them, the first in 1961, the 49th Grey Cup that went in overtime, the second in 1962, the 50th Grey Cup, played in horrendous fog, both against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

It was intended as a substitute for the contrabassoon, which at that time was an unsatisfactory instrument, with a muffled sound due to tone holes that were too small and too close together. Haseneier's design made use of some of the same principles that went into the Boehm system flute, in which keywork was developed based on tone holes with acoustically optimum sizes and positions. The contrabassophone's bore was substantially larger (by about a third) than that of the contrabassoon, and the result was an instrument with a powerful tone. Indeed, it was regarded as too loud for orchestral use, though it was suitable for outdoor use in military bands. Dr W.H. Stone brought a Haseneier instrument to England playing it in performances of the Handel Festival of 1871. Alfred Morton, the best English bassoon maker of the time made 3 or 4 copies of this instrument some of which included improvements in the keywork. In 1881, Morton's eldest son played one of these instrument with the Halle Orchestra. He also played it at the Crystal Palace, at Richter's concerts and at the opera. Morton made one of a higher pitch (in F) for Sir Arthur Sullivan for use in the Savoy Theatre. Following Sullivan's death, this instrument disappeared. Many other European makers produced copies of the contrabassophone, including a lightweight version made of papier-m√¢ch√©. Adolphe Fontaine-Besson patented a similar instrument in 1890 but allowed the patent to lapse in 1898. By this time the contrabassophone had been largely superseded by improved versions of the contrabassoon for orchestral use, and by the tuba in wind bands. An instrument like those that Morton made has a range of three octaves and one tone from a low C to a high D. The fingerings are like a recorder to some degree, with a number of chromatic notes played with forked fingerings, making it quite difficult to play in keys with three or more accidentals. This could have been one of the reasons that the instrument was not played in English orchestras by the late part of the nineteenth century, instead being played in military bands such as the Coldstream, the Grenadier and the Scots Guards.

Central Presbyterian Church is a member of Mission Presbytery, in the Synod of the Sun region of the Presbyterian Church (USA). It maintains a program of ministry, outreach, and cultural events. It has presented free concerts weekly since 1980, and since 2006 the church has been a venue for the SXSW Music Festival.  History  The congregation traces its roots to October 13, 1839, when Austin's first Presbyterian worship service was held at Bullock's hotel. The City of Austin was chartered two and a half months later, December 27, 1839. Present at that service was builder Abner Cook, elder in the first Presbyterian church organized in Austin. He helped acquire the property at the northeast corner of Brazos and Bois d'Arc (now Eighth Street) for the Presbyterian Church (South) following a post-Civil War split in the church. A sanctuary was completed on the site in 1874; the current sanctuary was built in 1957. It was recognized by the Texas Historical Commission in 1989 as an historical site. The congregation was known in later years as Southern Presbyterian Church, the Free Presbyterian Church, First Southern Presbyterian Church, and (currently) Central Presbyterian Church. It has counted among its members many individuals important in the life of the denomination and the city of Austin, including Gov. Francis R. Lubbock; William Sidney Porter (O. Henry); A. N. and Jane Y. McCallum; Dr. George Clark and Rebecca Kilgore Stuart Red; and U. S. Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory. The Rev. Richmond Kelley Smoot, pastor from 1876 to 1905, played an important role in the national denomination and in the development of the Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary. The congregation has been instrumental in organizing five Presbyterian churches in Austin. First identified as Presbyterian Church (South), the congregation has been known subsequently as Austin Presbyterian Church, Southern Presbyterian Church, Free Presbyterian Church (i.e. its pews were not for sale to families) and First Southern Presbyterian Church. In 1983, with national reunification of the Northern and Southern branches of the denomination into the Presbyterian Church (USA), the church changed its name to Central Presbyterian Church.

She was the first wife of Colonel John Jacob Astor IV and later married Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale. Early life Ava Lowle Willing was born on September 15, 1868 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Edward Shippen Willing (1822-1906) and Alice Bell Barton (1833-1903). She had one older sister and two older brothers: (1) Susan Ridgway Willing (1862-1940) who married on November 3, 1899, Francis Cooper Lawrence Jr. (1858-1904), they had no issue; (2) John Rhea Barton Willing (1864-1913) he died from pneumonia unmarried with no issue; and (3) Edward Shippen Willing Jr. (1867-1873) he died at age six. Personal life=First marriage On February 17, 1891, she married Colonel John Jacob \\"Jack\\" Astor IV (1864‚Äì1912), son of William Backhouse Astor, Jr. (1829‚Äì1892) and Caroline Webster \\"Lina\\" Schermerhorn (1830‚Äì1908), at her parents mansion at 510 South Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They went on a 5-week honeymoon in Europe. The newlywed couple was given, among many lavish gifts, a furnished townhouse on Fifth Avenue in New York City.http://www.biography.com/people/madeleine-force- astor-283808#early-life Though the marriage was tumultuous, the Astors had two children: *William Vincent Astor (November 15, 1891 ‚Äì February 3, 1959) *Ava Alice Muriel Astor (July 7, 1902 ‚Äì July 19, 1956) The family lived in their New York townhouse at 840 Fifth Avenue, their 2,000 acre country estate, Ferncliff in Rhinebeck, New York, and Beechwood, their Newport, Rhode Island mansion. By 1896, Mrs. Ava Astor had become socially active in England. She had a country estate, Sutton Place in Guildford, Surrey, and a townhouse on Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, London. In 1909, after returning from England, Ava sued Jack for divorce on November 19, and four months later on March 5, 1910, the State of New York decreed in her favor. She received a $10 million () settlement. Their son lived with his father before leaving to attend Harvard University, while Ava got custody of their seven-year-old daughter. While Vincent was in his second year at Harvard, Jack was on the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, and became one of the casualties while returning from his honeymoon with his new bride, Madeleine Talmage Force. This event left young Vincent as one of the wealthiest men in the United States. Second marriage In September 1911, Ava and her daughter moved to England. They lived in her townhouse on Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, London (from October‚ÄìApril) and her country estate, Sutton Place in Guildford, Surrey (from May‚ÄìSeptember). When World War I broke out, Ava became involved with the American Women's War Relief Fund and she served as the group's vice-president. On June 3, 1919, Ava married Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale at St Mary's, Bryanston Square in London and she was known as Lady Ribblesdale. Lister died six years later on October 21, 1925, at their townhouse on Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, London. They had no children together and after Baron Ribblesdale's death, she did not remarry. He was buried in the Lister vault at St Mary the Virgin Churchyard in Gisburn, Lancashire. In June 1940, she returned to the United States on the liner as a war refugee, reclaimed her American citizenship, and became known as Mrs. Ava Willing Ribblesdale. Death On June 9, 1958, Ava died in her apartment at 720 Park Avenue in Manhattan, New York. Ava is buried at Locust Valley Cemetery, in Locust Valley, New York. She left a token bequest of $25,000 to her son, Vincent, but the bulk of her $3,000,000 estate was left to her daughter Ava Alice's four children: Prince Ivan Sergeyevich Obolensky, Princess Sylvia Sergeyevna Obolensky, Romana von Hofmannsthal, and Emily Edwina Harding.

It is Aarne-Thompson type 875.D. L. Ashliman, \\"The Peasant's Clever Daughter\\" This type of tale is the commonest European tale dealing with witty exchanges.Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p 158-9, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977 Synopsis A peasant begged some land from the king. When he and his daughter dug the field, they found a mortar made of gold. The daughter warned that if they gave it to the king for his kindness, he would ask for the pestle as well; the father gave it nonetheless, and the king asked for the pestle and put him in prison until he got it. The peasant lamented his folly in not listening to his daughter. The king had him brought before him again, and asked what he meant. The peasant explained. The king summoned the daughter and set her riddle: to come to him neither naked nor clothed, neither walking nor riding, neither on the road nor off it. If she guessed it, she had proved her cleverness and would marry him. She wrapped herself in fish net, and tied it to a donkey's tail so that it had to drag her along, and she kept only one toe touching the ground. The king agreed that she had guessed the riddle; he freed her father and married her. Some years later, a mare gave birth to a foal that ran off and lay down under an ox. Both the peasant who owned the mare and the one who owned the ox claimed it; the king said it belonged where it was found. The peasant who owned the mare went to the queen for help. She told him to take a fishing net and pretend to fish on dry land where the king would see; when the king said it was impossible, he was to say it was no more impossible than oxen giving birth to foals. The peasant did so, and the king gave him the foal but got from him that the queen had given him the advice. He sent the queen back to her father, saying she could take only one thing, what she valued most, from the castle. The queen gave him a sleeping draught and took him back to her father's house. When he woke, she told him that he was what she valued most in the castle; he took her back with him to the castle and once again recognized her as his wife.

New York, London: G. P. Putnam's sons. 1916. p. 256. Ulrich Marzolph and Richard van Leewen comment that the motif of the clever maiden who answers the prince's riddles is ancient enough to be present in the Mahabharata and in narratives of the Jatakas.Marzolph, Ulrich; van Leewen, Richard. The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia. Vol. I. California: ABC-Clio. 2004. pp. 143-144.

Designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, construction was completed in 1986. The building is two towers: a 60-story Main Tower and an 11-story Auxiliary Tower. At 570 feet (174 m), the Main Tower claims its place among the 50 tallest buildings in Chicago. The building is considered the \\"final work\\" by respected Bangladeshi-American structural engineer and designer Fazlur Rahman Khan. Completed after his death, the diagonal brace structure is dedicated to Khan, and serves as an architectural nod to his John Hancock Center. The X formations on the exterior are concrete infill panels which act together to form a truss tube. There are no steel beams behind them. A similar structured building, 780 Third Avenue in New York City, was completed in 1983. Onterie Center is the first concrete high-rise in the world to use diagonal shearwalls at the building perimeter. This type of design uses fewer columns and allows for a distinct unit layout. In 1986 this building won the Best Structure Award from the Structural Engineers Association of Illinois. In addition to its 594 apartments, Onterie Center also includes more than of office space (13,000 square meter), nearly 16,000 square feet (1,500 square meter) of ground-floor retail space, an 11,750-square-foot (1,100 square meter) health club facility with indoor swimming pool, and a 363-space, above- grade parking garage.

ELISA is a common means of determining antibody titers. For example, the indirect Coombs test detects the presence of anti-Rh antibodies in a pregnant woman's blood serum. A patient might be reported to have an \\"indirect Coombs titer\\" of 16. This means that the patient's serum gives a positive indirect Coombs test at any dilution down to 1/16 (1 part serum to 15 parts diluent). At greater dilutions the indirect Coombs test is negative. If a few weeks later the same patient had an indirect Coombs titer of 32 (1/32 dilution which is 1 part serum to 31 parts diluent), this would mean that she was making more anti-Rh antibody, since it took a greater dilution to abolish the positive test. Many traditional serological tests such as hemagglutination or complement fixation employ this principle. Such tests can typically be read visually, which makes them fast and cost-effective in a \\"low-tech\\" environment. The interpretation of serological titers is guided by reference values that are specific to the antigen or antibody in question; a titer of 1:32 may be below the cut-off for one test but above for another.

History Official The Kingpins logo The group formed in 1994 by founding members of the Kingpins: Eric 'Boum Boum' Boulanger on drums, Jordan Swift on bass, Ian 'Hot Tub' Hodkinson on organ, and Lorraine Muller on alto saxophone (later given the nickname \\"The Queen of Ska\\" by Bobby Beaton, she went on to play tenor and baritone saxes, and eventually became the lead singer.) The band's first big break came with the release of their first single, \\"On the Run\\", written by Hodkinson and Muller which garnered them the 1995 Montreal Independent Music Industry award in the category of Best Single. The single was released with two B-sides, \\"Spy vs. Spy\\" (a cover) and \\"Leave My Girlfriend Alone\\" (by Nigel Goddard, alto sax). The Montr√©al ska scene took notice and Kingpins shows attracted increasingly larger crowds. The wave of support was continued with the release of the band's first full-length album Watch Your Back in 1997, but it wasn't until 1999 that they broke out into the mainstream media with the release of their second album Let's Go To Work, a more traditional-based ska album. The success of the second album led to major exposure, such as performances on the Warped Tour, at the Montreal Jazz Festival and extensive touring in Europe. The third and final album under the Kingpins' name was Plan of Action, released in September 2000. This album represented a major shift in the Kingpins' musical direction. Vocal duties were taken over almost exclusively by Lorraine Muller, one of the band's original members. Before the release of Plan of Action Muller was primarily responsible for playing baritone saxophone and singing vocals on a few songs. The band also experimented with different stylistic fusions, mixing ska with various other musical genres, including new wave and breakbeat. The album also featured guest appearances by many big names in the Canadian ska scene, including Dave \\"JFK\\" Adams of JFK & the Conspirators, and Mitch \\"King Kong\\" Girio of King Apparatus fame. Though these were drastic changes, the album was well received. The group toured on and off over the next four years, but by 2004, the band's line-up included only one original member (Muller), and the group announced on October 28, 2004 that their next album would be released under the name Lo and the Magnetics. At the time of their \\"breakup\\", the Kingpins consisted of Lorraine Muller on lead vocals and saxophone, Chris Raz on guitar, Dan Meier on saxophone, Russ Cooper on bass, and Mike Gasselsdorfer on drums. In concert, Lo and the Magnetics occasionally played songs that were released under the Kingpins' name, though they referred to them as \\"covers\\". They have, however, retired some of the Kingpins' most notable songs, such as \\"The 10 Commandments of Ska\\". The Magnetics are on hiatus and expect to record some demos at some point.

He is considered a pioneer in the field of tephrochronology, and he made significant contributions in many areas of geology, especially volcanology and glaciology, both in Iceland and abroad. Biography Sigur√∞ur √û√≥rarinsson was born in Vopnafj√∂r√∞ur in northeastern Iceland in 1912. He received his Ph.D. from Stockholm University College in 1944 and began a long and distinguished academic career as professor of geography at the University of Iceland. According to his obituary in The Geographical Journal, \\"He was something of a polymath who contrived to take geology, geomorphology, glaciology, climatology, and archaeology in his stride.\\" He died suddenly of a heart attack in Reykjav√≠k in 1983. Subsequently, the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) decided to name its highest award the Thorarinsson Medal in his honor. As usual outside Iceland, the name of the prize misunderstands Icelandic naming conventions, because √û√≥rarinsson is a patronymic not a surname, and in Iceland he would have properly been referred to by his given first name, Sigur√∞ur. Eldur er √≠ Nor√∞ri is collection of papers, published by his colleague when Sigur√∞ur turned 70 years old. He was the first to receive the award of Steno Medal in 1969 by the Geological Society of Denmark for his work with volcanology and tephrochronology.

It is a part of the trilogy, Meghe Dhaka Tara (1960), Komal Gandhar (1961), and Subarnarekha (1962), all dealing with the aftermath of the Partition of India in 1947 and the refugees coping with it. Plot summary The film tells the story of Ishwar Chakraborty (Abhi Bhattacharya), a Hindu refugee from East Pakistan after the 1947 partition of India. He goes to West Bengal with his little sister Sita (Indrani Chakrabarty) where he tries to start a new life. In a refugee camp, they see the abduction of a low-caste woman and Ishwar takes her little son Abhiram (Sriman Tarun) with him. He gets a job at a factory in the province, near the river Subarnarekha, courtsey his college friend Rambilas (Pitambar). Ishwar, Sita and Abhiram arrive at Chatimpur, a small settlement near Ghatshila where they meet Mukherjee (Jahor Roy), foreman of the foundry workshop, who greets them with love. Abhiram is sent to Jhargram for education shortly after and Sita becomes lonely. Abhiram completes his study successfully and comes back on the very day Ishwar was appointed as the new manager. Abhiram finds that Ishwar had already arranged for his application in a German University to pursue his career further in engineering, but to his foster-brother's surprise, he refuses and decides to become a writer instead. Soon after, he (Satindra Bhattacharya) and Sita (Madhabi Mukherjee) discover that they are in love. But at this moment, Ishwar's fear of prejudice emerges, as he does not want his sister, a Brahmin, to marry a lower caste boy. At the same time, Abhiram's caste gets exposed to the others also when he recognizes his dying mother at rail station in front of many people. Ishwar senses danger and asks him to leave for Calcutta when he gives proposal to marry Sita. During Sita's wedding with another man, the girl and Abhiram elope and go to Calcutta. Ishwar is angry and heartbroken. Sita and Abhiram live in the slums of Calcutta and try to make ends meet. They have a little son (Sriman Ashok Bhattacharya). One day, Abhiram gets a new job as a bus driver, but this leads to tragedy: when he accidentally hits and kills a little girl, he is lynched by the crowd. In her desperate situation, Sita is forced to think about taking up prostitution. In the meantime, Ishwar is living a lonely and sad life in the province. When his old time friend Haraprasad (Bijon Bhattacharya) comes to visit him, they decide to go to Calcutta on a binge drinking tour. They finally end up in a brothel, both completely drunk. When Ishwar staggers into one of the bedchambers, he is faced... with his own sister, whose first \\"client\\" he should become. Sita immediately recognizes him and cuts her own throat rather than have her brother see how far she has fallen. She dies. When Ishwar realizes what has happened, he breaks down. At the end of the film, the now completely broken Ishwar meets Sita's little son, who is now his closest relative. Ishwar and Binu arrives at Ghatshila rail station. Just as the train leaves, Ishwar receives a letter from foreman Mukherjee from which he comes to know that he has been sacked from his managerial job because of his truthful ideology and all the legal matter he faced after her sister committed suicide. Mukherjee is now the new manager and he asks Ishwar to vacate the quarter. Ishwar, at first, feels lost but as he sees little Binu, he brightens up and decides to take the little boy into his clutches. The film ends with the two approaching the quarter along the banks of Subarnarekha, with Binu, not knowing the reality fills with joy to see his new home, the story he has been told by his mother many times, while Ishwar pants but still does not reveal the truth in order not to spoil his little nephew's dream.

Success depends on catching a murderous and highly active gang of armoured-car robbers. Another source of rivalry is that Vrinks' wife used to be Klein's lover. Vrinks is an effective detective with loyal subordinates, and some unsavory informants. Klein, who has questionable ethics, is less accomplished. Consequently, his marriage is strained and he drinks heavily. Vrinks helps people such as a bartender, who is raped and beaten by Bruno (Ivan Franek) while being robbed. Vrinks and his team kidnap Bruno, drive him to a forest, strip and bind him, give him a mock execution, push him into an open grave, warn him to leave her alone and abandon him. Vrinks' use of informants backfires when one on weekend release from prison, Silien (Roschdy Zem), tricks him into being his getaway driver when he murders a gangster whose testimony convicted him. Silien, in a quid pro quo for Vrinks' providing an alibi and keeping silent, tells him about the gang's personnel and hideout. Vrink, implicated in the murder, has little choice but to agree. The victim was an informant of Klein, who suspects Silien of involvement. Vrinks' team stake out the hideout, with Klein's team as backup but, on the verge of arrests, Klein ignores procedure and drunkenly approaches the gang. While most are still apprehended, an alerted car load open fire, killing Vrinks' best friend and taking a detective hostage. Later, she escapes and one of the criminals is caught and another shot while trying to force a roadblock. An investigation is launched into the detective's death, but one of Klein's informants coincidentally introduces him to a prostitute who witnessed the murder by Silien. Discovering Vrinks' role, Klein ensures he is prosecuted, meaning that Vrinks' evidence on the gang arrest is inadmissable and Klein exonerated of blame. He offers Camille help but she rejects him. While awaiting proceedings, Vrinks disarms his guards to talk to his wife, Camille (Valeria Golino), in the court corridor. Camille is invited to a meeting by Silien, but her phone is being tapped by Klein's team, who are seeking him. Silien gets into her car and offers her money to live on. Klein, who has been tailing her, orders his team to move in to capture Silien despite being warned of the danger to Camille. They flee but Klein orders that Camille's small and insubstantial car forced off the road and she and Silien are killed in the crash. Klein uses Silien's gun to shoot the dead Camille, then uses his own gun to shoot Silien's body. It now looks like Silien shot Camille, causing the crash, and Klein then shot Silien in self-defence, absolving him of responsibility for their deaths. Seven years later, Vrinks is released. Klein, who now heads the Paris criminal police, kept his team silent about the truth of Camille's death by promotions, retirements and transfers. Vrinks reunites with his daughter, telling her they are leaving after some unfinished business. He visits Titi, an old colleague, who now works at a club, to find out about Camille's death. They have an spontaneous fight with men who seemed familiar, namely Bruno's friends, who threaten revenge. Later, Bruno ambushes Titi and discovers he was one of the policemen who humiliated him before. He demands to know the names of the others before beating him into a coma. Vrinks gets a gun to take revenge on Klein, who is attending a police ball. Using a stolen ID, Vrinks attends and confronts Klein in the lavatory. Klein explains Camille was dead when he shot her, and Vrinks suggests he kill himself with Vrinks' gun to avoid exposure. After Vrinks leaves, Klein follows him out, shouting obscenities, threatening to shoot him and blaming him for Camille's death. Bruno, lying in wait, shoots Klein dead. It appears that Titi gave his attackers Klein's name, instead of Vrinks's. The film ends with Vrinks and his daughter at airport security, heading for a new life abroad.

This castle is well known as one of the three Mizujiro, or \\"Castles on the sea\\", in Japan, along with Takamatsu Castle in Kagawa Prefecture and Nakatsu Castle in ≈åita Prefecture. History This castle was constructed by T≈çd≈ç Takatora, a local daimy≈ç. He collected superior knowledge and techniques for building castles from 1602 to 1604 in order to build his own castle. The original major castle to rule the area was Kokufu Castle located on the top of Mount Karako. However, Takatora thought the Kokufu Castle was not in the best place for the governance of the area, so he abolished the old castle and made a new one, Imabari Castle. In 1635, this castle and Imabari Domain was succeeded by Matsudaira Sadafusa who is nephew of Tokugawa Ieyasu. After that, he and his descendants ruled there for Edo period. Imabari Castle is in the center right. By the order of the Meiji Government, all of the buildings associated with the castle were destroyed. And land ownership was sold to local Shinto shrine. In 1980, the Imabari City government constructed the new donjon tower in the castle. Features Imabari castle features a vast seawater moat, a high stone wall and a rare style of main gate. The moat averages 60 meters in length and is intended to neutralize arrows. Almost all parts of the high stone wall have remain unchanged since the Edo Period. The main gate, , is iron-plated and flanked by turrets. State of Reconstruction Imabari Castle has remained intact only regarding the walls and moat. The remaining buildings are reconstructions, mainly fabricated from concrete. The tenshu in particular, or keep, is a modern concrete construction, only imitating the outer appearance of the original. The interior is modern and not representative of the original design. It houses several exhibitions regarding weapons, armor, writings and castle photography. Its top floor serves as viewing point over the city. The tenshu also houses the city's natural science museum. The Kurogane-gomon and Bugu-yagura turrets have been reconstructed also with interior and a small exhibition including a model and various videos explains their function and the castle's history. Further buildings include the Yamazato-yagura and Okane- yagura turrets, which are home to the antiquity museum and local art museum.

The model number, 15, refers to the magazine capacity. When introduced, this was the first pistol holding a greater number of rounds than the 13-round Browning Hi- Power. The PA-15 was introduced in 1966 along with a short-lived 8-round version with a single stack magazine, the P-8. Use The PA-15 was designed for commercial sale, primarily for export as French laws severely restricted the possession of \\"military-caliber\\" arms (which included the ubiquitous 9mm). The pistols were proofed at the St Etienne proof house and many were exported to the US. Early pistols are blued, later ones Parkerized. There was a competition version called the P-15 F1. This version had a longer slide and barrel (150mm), and an adjustable rear sight. While the French armed forces did not adopt the PA-15, the Army, Air Force (Arm√©e de l'Air) and the Gendarmerie bought limited quantities of the competition model under the designation Pistolet Automatique de Pr√©cision (PAP) Mod√®le F1. When the French Gendarmerie was looking for a double-action pistol with a high magazine capacity to replace their aging PA 1950s, MAB produced an experimental model of the PA-15 with double-action lockwork. However, the Gendarmerie instead procured a license to manufacture the Beretta 92F as the MAS G-1, and the double-action PA-15 was not commercially produced. Outside France, in the 1970s the Finnish military and some police forces adopted the PA-15. When the Manufacture d'armes de Bayonne closed in 1982, all remaining PA-15 parts were sold to a French company, Lechkine Armory (Armurerie Chevasson), which as of 2009 still assembled and sold new PA-15s, and is the sole source for new PA-15 parts.http://www.armurerie-lechkine-chevas...rerie.php?id=3 Functioning 300px MAB PA-15 is a delayed blowback operated, semi-automatic pistol. It featured Savage-type, rotating, but not reciprocating, barrel, which has two lugs: one under the chambers is engaged in the frame and allows to the barrel to rotate but not to move back or forward. The other lug, on the upper surface of the barrel, is engaged in the curved-shaped notch inside the slide. When the pistol is fired, the barrel inertia and the bullet torque acted against the blowback force of the slide via the slope-shaped part of the notch. When bullet leaves the barrel, the slide rotates barrel and retracts to cycle the action. MAB PA-15 has a frame mounted safety, on the left side of the frame, and also internal magazine safety, which does not allow the gun to be fired with magazine removed.  Variants  A long-barreled version, known as the PA-15 Target, was used by the French military as the PAP F-1. 7,65 Parabellum for Italian market.

He played college football at the University of Miami and is enshrined in their Hall of Fame. Early years Born in Clearfield Florida, Conners was raised in St. Marys, Pennsylvania and was a 1959 graduate of St. Marys high school. He led the Flying Dutchmen to undefeated seasons in 1957 and 1958 as a fullback and center while also earning varsity letters in wrestling and baseball. That got the attention of the University of Miami (Fla.) where Conners began his college career as a center on the freshman team. He then moved to offensive tackle and then started to make a significant impact on the defensive side of the ball at tackle. The eventual University of Miami Hall of Famer was 6-foot-2, 240 pounds by his senior year and broke the season record for tackles at that time with 57 tackles and 38 assists in 1962. In 1963, Conners was named an All- American defensive tackle. Pro career In the spring of 1964, Conner was drafted twice ‚Äî by the Chicago Bears in the fifth round (70th pick) in the NFL draft and by the Raiders in the second round (15th overall) of the AFL or American Football League draft. Conners signed with the Raiders and started an 11-year career that continued through 1974. Conners moved to middle linebacker and helped anchor the defensive unit that helped lead the team to the playoffs seven of Conners‚Äô 11 seasons, 13 games in all. In 1967, Conners and the Raiders reached the Super Bowl after going 13-1 in the AFL and beating the Houston Oilers, 40-7, for the league title as Conners had a fumble recovery. Against the powerful NFL champion Green Bay Packers in the second-ever Super Bowl, the Raiders lost 33-14. The next year, the Raiders reached the AFL title game before losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Jets, 27-23. During the regular season, Conners played in the infamous ‚ÄúHeidi Bowl‚Äù where the Raiders scored two touchdowns in the final minute of a 43-32 win. However, NBC pre-empted the fantastic finish to go to its regular-scheduled feature film Heidi, causing predictable outrage. The Raiders reached the AFL title game again in 1969 and lost to another eventual Super Bowl champion, this time hated rival Kansas City, 17-7. Conners recovered a fumble in the loss. Once again in 1970 now in the American Football Conference after the merger of the NFL and AFL, the Raiders lost again in the conference championship game to another eventual Super Bowl champion as the Raiders lost 17-7 to the Baltimore Colts. Oakland missed the playoffs in 1971 and reached the postseason again in 1972, winning the AFC West with a 10-3-1 record. In the first round of the playoffs, the Raiders locked up with an emerging power and arch-rival in the Pittsburgh Steelers at Three Rivers Stadium. In what was dubbed the Immaculate Reception game, it was Conners and the Raiders losing 13-7 on the final play of the game when Franco Harris grabbed a deflected pass out of the air and rambled into the end zone for the miracle finish. The Steelers wound up losing to the eventual unbeaten Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins the next week. Back again in 1973, the Raiders won the AFC West, avenged the loss to the Steelers in the first round of the playoffs and lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Dolphins in the conference final, 27-10. Conners‚Äô final season of 1974 saw the Raiders win the AFC West once again with a 12-2 mark, the best record in the NFL. After beating the defending champion Dolphins 28-26 in the first round in the famous \\" Sea of Hands \\" game, the Raiders lost at home to another eventual Super Bowl champion as the Steelers, down 10-3 going into the fourth quarter, outscored the Raiders 21-3 in the final quarter to win 24-13. The Steelers went on to win their first Super Bowl, beating the Vikings, 16-6. Conners appeared in 141 games with the Raiders, 110 of them as a starter. While tackles weren‚Äôt considered an official statistic until much later, Conners had 15 interceptions, returning three of them for touchdowns and he recovered 16 fumbles, returning two for scores. Conners made several postseason All-Pro teams, mostly during a stretch from 1967 through 1969. He was a second-team all-AFL pick in 1967 by the Association Press, United Press International and The Sporting News. In 1968, he earned first-team All-AFL honors by UPI and Pro Football Weekly and second team by the AP. In 1969, he was a first-team All-AFL pick by The Sporting News and second team by the AP. Conners was named as one of the six linebackers on the AFL Hall of Fame All-1960 Team, joining the likes of Bobby Bell, Nick Buoniconti, George Webster, Larry Grantham and Mike Stratton. The Chiefs‚Äô Bell and the Dolphins‚Äô Buoniconti are Pro Football Hall of Famers. In Conners‚Äô 11 seasons, the Raiders won seven division titles and compiled a 105-38-11 regulat-season record (.718 winning percentage). He was foundational piece of the Raiders‚Äô defense over that period. Two years after he retired, the Raiders won their first Super Bowl title against the Vikings in 1976.

Hatfield Library is the main library at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, United States. Opened in 1986, it is a member of the Orbis Cascade Alliance along with several library lending networks, and is a designated Federal depository library. Willamette's original library was established in 1844, two years after the school was founded. The library was housed in Waller Hall before moving to its own building (now Smullin Hall) in 1938. Two stories tall, the library contains over 350,000 volumes overall in its collections, and includes the school's archives.Mark O. Hatfield Library: Collection Development. Willamette University. Retrieved on March 2, 2008. Designed by MDWR Architects, the red-brick building has glass edifices on two sides and a clocktower outside the main entrance. The building also includes a 24-hour study area, private study rooms, and a classroom. The academic library is named in honor of former Senator Mark O. Hatfield, a 1943 graduate of Willamette and former member of the faculty. History Founded in 1844, Willamette University's library was started two years after the establishment of the school. The library grew to a size of 2,500 volumes in 1874. University Hall (now Waller Hall), which was built in 1867, was one of the homes of the library in the early years. The library was located on the third floor of the building. The early name for the institution was the Willamette University Library, which by 1901 was a free, general library with both circulating and reference collections. That year the library collection had grown to 4,686 volumes, along with a total of 2,753 pamphlets. By 1909 the school library had 6,000 books valued at $3,500 and Ray D. Fisher was librarian. During November of that year the library received new furniture as Eaton Hall opened, and many departments were moved to it from Waller Hall. The library was re-cataloged in 1912 by Lucia Haley, a specialist from New York City hired by the school for this task. At that time the librarian was Dr. Lyle. Plans at this time called for constructing a building where the Art Building now stands to serve as a memorial to the pioneers of the university. This was to be the future home of the library, but the building was never built. In 1913, the librarian was Mary Field, and the collection was still about 6,000 volumes. Field was replaced the following year by Fannie J. Elliot. On December 17, 1919, a fire gutted Waller Hall, the home of the library. The school rebuilt the interior of the hall, with construction beginning in February 1920. The library was moved to the second floor of the rebuilt structure and reopened in December 1920. At that time William E. Kirk was the librarian and the facility had a capacity of 100 people. By 1922 the collection had grown to 16,000 volumes, and F. G. Franklin served as the school's librarian. Smullin Hall on the left, former home of the library In 1937, construction began on a new concrete and brick- faced building to house the library. Completed in 1938, the building housed a collection that grew to 35,000 volumes in 1940. Now known as Smullin Hall, the library building was designed by architect Pietro Belluschi in the Georgian style of architecture. In 1965, the school received a $450,000 loan from the federal government for the library. Congressman Al Ullman worked to secure status as a Federal Depository Library in the late 1960s, with status conferred in 1969. In 1980, Willamette began a multi-year fund raising campaign intended to raise funds to renovate academic halls and build a new library, with $18 million total raised during the funding drive. At the time the library held a collection of 143,000 volumes. Plans for a new library to be named in honor of alumnus and former faculty member Mark Hatfield were announced in the spring of 1985. Originally estimated to cost $6.8 million, groundbreaking was on April 13, 1985, with Hatfield in attendance. On September 4, 1986, the new library building was dedicated in a ceremony featuring Hatfield, then Senator Bob Packwood, and then Librarian of Congress Daniel J. Boorstin. Then school president Jerry E. Hudson presided over the ceremony that had over 700 people in attendance. All funds for the $7.4 million library came from private donors that numbered over 1,300 companies, individuals, or non-profit organizations. Large donations came from the Fred Meyer Charitable Trust, the M. J. Murdock Charitable Trust, and The Collins Foundation. Construction was a part of a broader plan to open up the southern portion of the campus after railroad tracks were removed in 1981 and the Mill Race re-routed and landscaped. The library lost a rare book in 1999 when a vandal used a razorblade to cut out the 30 pages of The Old Days in and Near Salem, Oregon. A limited edition art book, a replacement was donated to the school by the Oregon State Library. In 2002, the library received a $500,000 grant from the Meyer Memorial Trust for the library's archives department. Building Mill Race, Hudson's Bay, and Jackson Plaza in front of building Glass wall on the south side of the library Located in the middle of Willamette's campus along the Mill Race, the Hatfield library was built in 1986 with the design by Theodore Wofford of MDWR Architects in St. Louis, Missouri. The building is two stories tall and has a total of . Architectural plans allow for the addition of a third floor to the structure. The library is a modern looking rectangular structure with orange brick and clear glass which is adjacent to Glenn Jackson Plaza and Hudson's Bay, with the Mill Race flowing by on the north side. The north and south faces are clear glass, while the other two sides are brick. The exterior walls taper slightly outward on the brick sides of the building. Bricks on these sides were laid horizontally, while the overhanging roof line contains bricks that were laid vertically. A glass-enclosed stairwell and the main entrance near the northwest corner are the only parts that jut out from the primarily rectangular building. Inside, the Hatfield Library contains a 24-hour study area, private study rooms, a classroom, the university's archives, and listening rooms. On the main floor is the circulation desk, reference section, and work stations, among others. The building also holds a formal reception area, the Mark O. Hatfield Room, and the Hatfield archives that contain the former Senator's papers, both located on the second floor. Interior space was left mainly open to allow for flexibility with the evolving needs and technology of the library. Artist Dean Larson painted the portrait of Hatfield that hangs in the library. Outside the library is a tall steel and brick clock tower. The tower has one clock face on each of the four sides, a copper roof, and glass running down each side towards the 18 ton base. The glass consists of vertical panels created by taking strips of bent glass and weaving them together. There are inscriptions of various quotes in the exposed portions of the concrete on the tower. Lawrence Halperin was responsible for the landscaping designs of the library. Operations Hatfield Library is the main library on Willamette's campus, with the law school's library as the only other library at the school. The director of the library is Craig Milberg, who heads a staff of 18 employees, of which 10 are librarian. Regular circulation transactions totaled 14,158 in 2015, with an additional 1,923 in reference requests. Collections The library contains over 390,000 volumes, more than 317,000 titles, and over 1,400 journal subscriptions. These collections include periodicals, books, newspapers, microforms, sound recordings, videos, government documents, CD- ROMS, and musical scores. As of 2006, this includes 365,609 volumes of books, past issues of periodicals, and other printed sources; 11,508 items in the audio visual collection; 5,147 subscriptions to periodicals; and 337,918 microforms. The library also offers access to electronic sources through FirstSearch, RLIN, OCLC, EPIC, and DIALOG among others. Additionally, university publications such as the yearbook (The Wallulah), the student newspaper (Willamette Collegian), school catalogs, the Willamette Journal of the Liberal Arts, and the Willamette Scene among others, are collected by the library. Inside Hatfield Library Hatfield Library is a member of Orbis Cascade Alliance (Summit) and the Northwest Association of Private Colleges and Universities (NAPCU) lending networks. These networks allow students to borrow additional materials from other member libraries and institutions from around the Pacific Northwest. Hatfield Library also contains the Mark O. Hatfield Archives containing the papers, memorabilia, and books of the former United States Senator and Willamette alumni. The papers include those from his time in the Oregon legislature through his time in the Senate and after leaving the Senate. Hatfield's personal library is part of the regular library catalog, however the books are non-circulating. The rest of the collection is not open to the public, as Hatfield's archives will not become accessible until 20 years after his death. The library also contains the university's archives on the second floor. The climate-controlled archives are housed in a area that includes offices for staff, including the school's official archivist. Willamette's library was designated as a Federal Depository Library in 1969. It serves as the library for the 5th Congressional District population. The library selects around 20% of the documents available with areas of concentration in earth sciences, education, history, politics, economics, health, accounting, business, government, public policy, human resources, and others. Additionally, the university selects major items from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the office of the President, and Congress. Other materials come from the Smithsonian Institution, the Small Business Administration, the Department of State, and the Department of Education to list a few. Namesake The Mark O. Hatfield Library is named for the former Senator and Governor of Oregon, Mark Odom Hatfield. Hatfield was born west of Salem in Dallas, Oregon, in 1922 and graduated from Salem High School in 1940. He graduated from Willamette University in 1943 and joined the U.S. Navy to fight in World War II. After the war Hatfield obtained a graduate degree from Stanford University before returning to Willamette as a professor and then as a dean. During this time he also served in Oregon's legislature before becoming Oregon Secretary of State, and then in 1958 he was elected as Oregon's governor. In 1966, he was elected to the United States Senate and served there until his retirement in 1997. He died in 2011.

They are particularly important in the boundary lubrication regime, where they can prevent solid surfaces from coming into direct contact, substantially reducing friction and wear. Several classes of friction modifier additives exist, the main examples being organic friction modifiers (OFMs), oil-soluble organo-molybdenum additives, functionalized polymers, and dispersed nanoparticles. * OFMs are amphiphilic surfactants, such as fatty acids, often derived from fats and vegetable oils. OFMs are important additives in modern engine oils and are also employed in fuels. They adsorb on metal surfaces and form incompressible monolayers which prevent asperity contact and reduce friction and wear. * Organo-molybdenum compounds, were initially developed as antiwear additives but were later recognized to be very effective in reducing boundary friction. They are currently used in many engine oils and, more recently, in gear oils. * Functionalized polymers can be tailored to adsorb specifically on polar surfaces have been shown to markedly reduce friction and wear. * Dispersed nanoparticles have been shown to reduce boundary friction but they have not yet found widespread employment in practical applications. Reduction of frictional losses and through more efficient lubrication is a key target in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. One approach has been to progressively reduce lubricant viscosity to minimize hydrodynamic shear, churning and pumping losses. However, this means that an increased number of components operate under boundary lubrication conditions. This has led to a resurgence in interest in friction modifier additives, particularly OFMs. For example, recent tribology experiments and molecular dynamics simulations have given new insights into their behaviour under boundary lubrication conditions.

William Frederick Horry, also known as Fred Horry (December 1843 ‚Äì 1 April 1872), was the first person to be hanged by Victorian hangman William Marwood, and the first to fall using the long drop method.William Marwood - Hangman - Horncastle Discovered He was hanged at Lincoln Castle, Lincoln, England on 1 April 1872, aged 28, for the murder of his wife, Jane Horry. Biography and crime Horry was born in December 1843, in Boston, Lincolnshire, England. He married Jane in 1866 and they took over the George Hotel together in Burslem, Staffordshire, England. By September 1871, the two were estranged due to Horry's alcoholism and accusations of Jane's infidelity with customers. Jane went to live with Horry's father in Boston with their children whilst William stayed at the hotel. William made attempts to visit his family but due to his abusive behaviour, he was barred from further visits. Unable to maintain the business on his own, he sold the hotel and moved to Nottingham. In 1872, William pleaded with his wife a final time to return to him with their children. After being unsuccessful, he travelled to Nottingham, purchased a revolver and ammunition before returning again to Boston to murder his wife. Trial and execution At his trial on 31 March 1872, he pleaded insanity but the prosecution successfully argued that the crime was premeditated. He was sentenced to death by hanging the following day. William refused all appeals and was executed by William Marwood on 1 April. William Marwood had never hanged anyone before but persuaded the authorities in Lincoln to allow him to try a new \\"long drop\\" method. The long drop method is designed to snap the condemned persons neck instantly, causing unconsciousness and eventually asphyxiation, it was considered a more humane method than the existing short drop method that had been used for centuries. The execution went without any complications and Marwood went on to hang 176 people. A memorial to William Frederick Horry exists in Burslem, Staffordshire consisting of a granite obelisk. William is buried in a simple grave in the Lucy Tower of Lincoln Castle. The grave (featuring only the initials of the condemned and the date of death) is well preserved and is still visible, along with many other criminals' graves. The name Horry is still common in the Lincolnshire area, but William's particular line has apparently died out following the First World War.Boston Standard: Letters to the editor Media coverage Execution broadsides were often sold amongst the crowd that usually gathered for hangings and often gave gory details of the crime the condemned was accused of.

The Journal had launched the south's first radio station, WSB AM (\\"Welcome South Brother\\"), on 740 kHz (now 750) on March 15, 1922. In the late 1920s, the Journal experimented with a mechanical version of television, but eventually abandoned it. The earliest experiments with television involved a spinning disc with multiple holes in it, which provided ‚Äòmovement' on a projected surface. Early stations=WSB, channel 8 Television finally came to Atlanta-area and northern- and upper central-Georgia viewers on September 29, 1948 (called \\"T-Day\\" by the Journal) with the debut of WSB-TV, broadcasting on VHF channel 8. The newspaper led up to the TV station's launch, with front- page countdowns designed to boost excitement and sell TV sets. The inaugural WSB-TV program, which began with a recording of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" and a close-up shot of a tiny American flag waving in the wind powered by an electric fan, featured announcer John Cone (\\"WSB-TV is on the air!\\"), newscaster Jimmy Bridges, and a host of local dignitaries. WSB-TV originally broadcast from the Biltmore Hotel. They moved to a building at 1601 West Peachtree Street, about two miles (3 km) north on Peachtree Street in 1956. The building, designed to look like a southern mansion, was christened \\"White Columns\\". WSB-TV, in its abbreviated 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. broadcast day, aired a mix of kinescopes (film copies) which might arrive three days late from the NBC television network (WSB-AM had been a longtime NBC radio network affiliate, and most of the new television equipment was from NBC's corporate cousin, RCA), Atlanta Crackers baseball remote broadcasts from the club's stadium on Ponce de Leon Avenue, local news, and kids shows (Woody Willow, a marionette show featuring several stringed characters created and performed by Don and Ruth Gilpin, and a show featuring a man who built toys). A great many old movies were shown, and the station employed a unique censorship system in which monitors actually cut bits from film that were deemed \\"not family material\\" before broadcast. This was a slow and tedious process, handled by two women with scissors, and they usually removed any hint of unsavory language and even scenes in which a man and a woman (even married couples) might be seen in or on a bed. An early unique use of television occurred when a system-wide transit strike crippled the city and downtown commerce suffered, in an era before shopping malls had been developed in the suburban areas. WSB- TV broadcast, for a time, a daily four-hour \\"infomercial\\" (to use the modern term) for Rich's department store, which was affected economically when shoppers could not travel via bus to its downtown location. In its earliest days, the station aired a test pattern for many hours each day, ostensibly to let people align their new-fangled television sets. It served, however, as extremely cheap \\"programming\\" which allowed an audience to gather as someone showed off his or her new set to his or her envious friends. The test pattern, in black and white, featured multiple shades of grey and a large picture of a Native American (the ubiquitous and now-classic Indian Head test card). Early employee Mike McDougald recounted, \\"I would drive from WSB-AM to WSB-TV and see people congregated outside the store windows watching the test pattern. They were fascinated by it.\\" Virtually all employees of the new WSB-TV were \\"imports\\" from the radio station, leaving the radio side somewhat hampered by the loss of talent. WSB-AM continued to thrive, however, and actually supported the new television venture for several years until television moved into the \\"black\\".  WAGA-TV, channel 5  Crosstown radio station WAGA-AM (now WYZE, 1480 AM), owned by The Fort Industries (later renamed \\"Storer Broadcasting\\"), launched a station on channel 5 in the fall of 1949, taking CBS, DuMont and occasionally, ABC shows. The new television operation was squeezed into a converted residential house on Peachtree Street, with a tall tower built in the backyard of the property. WAGA-TV's mascot, owned by the station's janitor, was a (real) Yorkshire terrier named \\"Waga\\". In addition to CBS shows, WAGA aired a daily hillbilly music show with local personality Jon Farmer, Atlanta Crackers baseball (taken from WSB and later lost to newcomer WLW-A), interview shows featuring politicians like Senator Herman Talmadge and local newscasts featuring a newsreader sitting at a modest desk with a world map on the wall behind. I was little girl when my father, Bill McCain was News Director at WAGA. Jim Bailey was the station Manager. As I recall, William was the name of the Janitor/guy Friday, errand runner. I used to ride around in the station's station wagon with him when he did errands. As I recall the dog \\"WAGA\\" was a black Scotty, not a Yorkshire terrier. Jon Farmer and his wife Phyllis were good family friends. They also had a ballroom dance show together (as I recall) that ran on Saturday evenings.. Source is myself.. The proposed WCON-TV WSB-TV and WAGA-TV served Atlanta for two years before a third station arrived. In March 1950, the Cox-owned Atlanta Journal and its crosstown rival, the Atlanta Constitution, merged. The Constitution owned a construction permit for a proposed WCON-TV on the more desirable channel 2 (reaching a larger broadcast range due to lower frequency), which was to have been the city's full-time ABC network station. With the merger, WSB-TV instead moved to channel 2 amid great publicity. WCON-TV thus never opened for business, and its sister radio station, WCON AM 550, was reassigned to nearby Gainesville, Georgia, where it is now WDUN.  WLTV, channel 8  WSB-TV's move to channel 2 opened an opportunity for a new station to operate on channel 8. In 1951, a group of Atlanta businessmen, including an executive from the local Davison's department store chain, pooled their capital and launched WLTV as Atlanta's first full-time ABC affiliate. WLTV's studios were installed in a small building directly behind WSB-TV's property, because that allowed the station to utilize WSB's old channel 8 transmitting tower. WLTV operated on a very tight budget and offered a smattering of local programming like cooking and fashion shows, \\"rip-and-read\\" local news coverage, and a show featuring the city's famous mayor, William B. Hartsfield, who answered viewer mail on his program. The station also offered the first \\"all Negro\\" program in Atlanta, a Saturday evening variety show.  WQXI, channel 36  In late 1953, eager entrepreneurs around the country were constructing UHF TV stations to meet the demand of television-hungry viewers. Southeast radio group owner Robert Rounsaville took the plunge, opening a UHF station off Atlanta's Peachtree Street in the same restored house where his \\"good music\\" station, WQXI AM 790, operated. An employee remembered that the station owned a huge, lumbering TV camera that had to be transported from room to room within the building to broadcast local talk shows. The AM station promoted the TV station incessantly, but the September 1953 beginning was met with indifference from Atlantans. Without much in the way of programming apart from old movies, an occasional show from the crumbling DuMont network, and a local Saturday night \\"Barn Dance,\\" there was little incentive for viewers to spend approximately $40 for a UHF converter. As such, WQXI-TV survived about nine months. WETV, channel 47, Macon While not an Atlanta station, Macon's first TV outlet received little attention from viewers or the press. In 1954, competing Macon AM radio stations WBML and WNEX pooled money, along with Macon businessman William Fickling, (later a healthcare tycoon) and launched WETV on channel 47. The NBC affiliate pre-dated the market's dominant CBS affiliate WMAZ, channel 13, by several months. As in Atlanta and other cities, few viewers were willing to pay extra for the special receiver needed to watch the UHF station, and after several shakeups (where channel 47 became WNEX-TV and then WOKA), it ceased operations. WMAZ would then become the central Georgia region's sole commercial television outlet for over a dozen years, until NBC returned in 1968 on another UHF station, WCWB-TV (now WMGT-TV) on channel 41. By that time, television manufacturers had been required by the Federal Communications Commission (under the All-Channel Receiver Act) to enable sets to receive UHF channels, without special external equipment.  WLWA, channels 8/11  In 1953, Cincinnati-based Crosley Broadcasting Corporation purchased WLTV (channel 8), providing a much-needed infusion of capital and a new name, \\"WLW-A\\", in keeping with the company's WLW group branding for its stations in Indiana and Ohio. Among the personalities from WLW-A's early days: Dick Van Dyke, who hosted a twice-daily lip synch show where he and Phil Erickson (together known as The Merry Mutes), along with a female partner, mouthed the lyrics to hit records. WLW-A continued to operate in the shadow of WSB-TV, both physically and in the minds of 1950s viewers. It wasn't until ABC began to get ratings traction with its late-1950s Warner Bros. Western shows that the station came of age.  WROM-TV, channel 9, Rome  Two months after Crosley set up shop in Atlanta, up the road, about to the northwest, the owners of a local AM radio station in Rome decided to get into television. WROM AM operated WROM-TV, channel 9, from 1953 until 1958, branding it \\"Dixie's Largest Independent.\\" The station ran a late-afternoon and prime-time schedule of old movies, \\"hillbilly\\" music performances (which were common on Southern TV stations in the 1950s and 1960s) and occasionally, ABC-TV network fare such as Omnibus. WROM's beginning, and its subsequent move to Chattanooga years later, changed Atlanta TV history and caused a fruit-basket turnover of Southeastern U.S. TV frequencies. As soon as channel 9 in Rome and channel 8 in Atlanta began operating simultaneously, viewers in northwestern Atlanta and in northwestern Georgia to the south of Rome began experiencing trouble tuning in either station. Crosley also wanted to increase transmitting power at its new station, which necessitated a change to present-day channel 11 (now WXIA- TV). By 1958, WROM's owners were making moves to cash in on their investment. The station began carrying a full prime-time slate of ABC network programs, overlapping programming with WLWA. In 1959, WROM's owners accepted an offer to sell their TV outlet to Martin Theaters, (reportedly for one million dollars) the company that also purchased Columbus, Georgia's WDAK-TV. Chattanooga had only two VHF stations at the time, WRGP (now WRCB)-TV, channel 3, (NBC) and pioneer broadcasting outlet WDEF-TV, channel 12 (CBS). Chattanooga offered channel 9's investors a better economic model than Rome, so the station moved and became Chattanooga ABC affiliate WTVC. That move 60 miles to the north opened opportunities for other television broadcasters within the state of Georgia.  Frequency changes  Atlanta regained channel 8 as an available frequency, though it was reclassified as a non-commercial educational facility, clearing the way for the University of Georgia's Athens-based station, WGTV (which, years later, relocated to its transmitter and tower to Stone Mountain to better serve Atlanta as part of Georgia Public Broadcasting's state network). Columbus, Georgia's NBC affiliate, WDAK-TV, channel 28, was able to move to VHF channel 9 (now WTVM, an ABC affiliate), while Dothan, Alabama's CBS affiliate, WTVY, moved from channel 9 to the more powerful (and thus desirable) channel 4, and Columbus' CBS affiliate, WRBL, moved from channel 4 over to channel 3. Ironically, Rome partially lost a second television frequency 40 years later, when UHF station channel 14 moved east to Bear Mountain near Waleska and Canton (north of Atlanta) after several years of operation. Though a strong radio market covering most of northwestern Georgia, the Rome metro area simply could not support television capable of competing with Chattanooga and Atlanta, both just 60 miles (100 km) distant north and southeast. Rome still remain's the city of license for the station, however, and it is one of two full-power TV stations having a northwest Georgia city of license, along with GPB's WCLP-TV 18 (now WNGH-TV 18.x, on RF channel 33) in Fort Mountain State Park near Chatsworth. Digital changes Since prior to the 2009 digital-only TV mandate, all local TV stations except WGTV 8 transmit digitally on channels other than their analog ones, with TV channels from 52 to 69 (the 700 MHz band) being taken mostly for 4G LTE mobile phones in a large spectrum auction (FCC auction 73). (WGCL-TV 46 remained on for another month as the designated \\"nightlight\\" station, WUVM-LP 4 and WTBS- LP 6 continue in analog .) Unlike other major media markets, no Atlanta TV stations will be taken off the air due to the 600MHz auction which ended in early 2017, but UHF channels 38 to 51 are being taken away, which will result in a \\"repack\\" of at least half of the local stations onto low UHF channels 14 to 36 in late summer 2019, and WGTV from 8 to 7 in 2020. All stations will still retain their historic channel numbers through the use of virtual channels, but re-scanning of TV tuners will be required after the changes. WUVG will move from 48 to 18, WUPA from 43 to 36, WSB from 39 to 32, WIRE from 40 to 33, WKTB from 47 to 23, WATC from 41 to 34, WHSG from 44 to 22, and WSKC from 22 to 14. Also included in the same fifth nationwide round of channel repacking, WANN, WPCH, WPXA, and WYGA will do a four-way frequency swap, moving from physical channels 29, 20, 31, and 16 to channels 20, 31, 16, and 29, respectively, in order to make room on those channels for stations in adjacent TV markets and avoid co-channel interference with them. No local stations are moving to VHF channels 2 to 13, but WGTV will change from 8 to 7 In the final repacking round in 2020. No Atlanta-market stations are channel sharing or going off-air due to the reverse auction 1000, but two nearby GPB stations won bids to move from UHF to VHF: WNGH-TV and WJSP-TV.

Consensus scholarship attributes the play's authorship to George Chapman. Date, performance, publication The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on January 10, 1606, and was published later that year in a quarto printed by John Windet for the bookseller Edward Blount. The title page of the quarto states that the play was acted by the Children of the Chapel, a production that most likely occurred in the 1601-3 period. (The Children of the Chapel were known by that name only in the company's first three years of existence, before the theatres closed in May 1603 due to an epidemic of bubonic plague. When the theatres re-opened, the company was known as the Children of the Queen's Revels or variations thereof.) The play was revived in the mid-1630s at the Salisbury Court Theatre; a second quarto followed that revival, issued in 1636 by Hugh Perry and Roger Bell.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 4, pp. 15-16. Authorship 19th-century critics noted the resemblances between Sir Giles Goosecap and Chapman's acknowledged comedies. The case for Chapman's authorship was stated persuasively by T. M. Parrott in 1906.T. M. Parrott, \\"The Authorship of Sir Giles Goosecap,\\" Modern Philology 4 (1906), pp. 25-37. Parrott's attribution essay has come to be regarded as among the best of its kind, and its conclusion has won general acceptance; even Samuel Schoenbaum, a prominent critic of authorship studies in general, conceded that Parrott's argument was likely valid.Samuel Schoenbaum, Internal Evidence and Elizabethan Dramatic Authorship: An Essay in Literary History and Method, Evanston, IL, Northwestern University Press, 1966; pp. 69-72 and ff. The plot The play centers on the melancholic poet- lover Clarence and his relationship with his mistress, the Countess Eugenia. Lord Momford, Eugenia's uncle, helps to treat and cure Clarence's depression by aiding him in the realization of his bond with Eugenia. The supporting characters conform to greater or lesser degrees to the concept of humours comedy that Chapman had introduced in his An Humorous Day's Mirth (1597); Captain Foulweather, for example, is an extreme Francophile who not only embraces French ways but rejects English manners -- and English women. Superficially, the play is a farce about \\"gulled knights and waggish servants,\\" though it has also been perceived to possess deeper levels of meaning; critics have judged it a \\"rarefied, pedantic neo-platonic allegory\\" as well as \\"a modern dress version of the Troilus story, based primarily on Chaucer's account and on Estienne Tabourot's Les apothegmes du sieur Gaulard.\\"Terence P.

It was written by a ghostwriter with suggestions from Cecily von Ziegesar. Aimed toward young adults, it is a spin-off from the bestselling Gossip Girl series. Synopsis After a long summer, Tinsley Carmichael returns to Waverly Academy, hoping to regain her place as the \\"It Girl\\". However, she receives a rude shock when she discovers that Jenny Humphrey is living in her old room, and upon their introduction, Tinsley immediately dislikes her. Despite her hopes, her friendship with Callie Vernon and Brett Messerschmidt is no longer what it used to be. Tinsley hears rumors about Brett and the young new teacher Eric Dalton, and decides to meet him. She seduces him almost immediately. She also starts a new \\"club\\", called Cafe Society, of which Brett and Jenny are, at first, a part of. Tinsley soon kicks Jenny out because of rumors of her and Easy Walsh, which Jenny denies, but Tinsley then confirms when she sees them sneaking around together. She also kicks Brett out, because she believes she is a traitor in siding with Jenny, and also because she enjoys taunting Brett. Torn between a relationship with Easy and school popularity, Jenny kisses a pizza delivery boy, Angelo, at a Cafe Society meeting to fit in with the other members. Ultimately, she chooses Easy, which generates ire from Callie. However, early in the relationship Easy hears rumors about Jenny's infidelity, causing him to end the relationship before it really begins. Callie is still having problems coping with her now-dead relationship with Easy. She suspects Jenny has feelings for him as well, and may be trying to steal him. This causes a major strain on her newly formed, tentative friendship with Jenny. Callie easily picks up her old friendship with Tinsley after a few awkward days and a couple of much-needed explanations. After Easy breaks up with Callie in favour of Jenny, she and Tinsely vow revenge on the new couple. Brett gains a new best friend in Jenny, as well as a new enemy in her old friend Tinsley. She becomes heartbroken when Eric breaks up with her, and is furious when she finds out he is now in a relationship with Tinsley. With Easy's assistance, she takes Dalton down by getting him fired for accounts of drug possession. Eventually, she gets back with Jeremiah, her ex-boyfriend from St. Lucius, after Jenny leaves a message on his phone about how much Brett is still in love with him. Jeremiah plays the message for Easy when they are at a Cafe Society overnight trip in Boston, and both of them leave immediately for their girls back home at Waverly. Brandon Buchanan still has feelings for Callie and thinks he has a chance when Easy breaks up with her. However, Callie doesn't want to be with him, even if she (drunkenly) kissed him good night on the way to her dorm. He drags along to the Boston trip to keep an eye on her and she loudly and drunkenly tells him off in front of everyone. The perpetually horny Heath Ferro gets caught with Tinsley and Callie, the three almost naked, on the balcony of their Boston hotel room by the dean of Waverly, who is in the next room over with his equally married coworker. An awkward conversation ensues, in which the dean tells the three to get back to Waverly in two hours or else. When Callie and Tinsley arrive late, thanks to Callie's hungover vomiting attack, Dean Marymount decides to split up the girls of Dumbarton 303, moving Tinsley and her ex-best friend Brett downstairs and keeping Callie and her most hated enemy Jenny in their current room.

When in the \\"Game\\" position, visual data is broadcast on VHF channel 3 by default, but may be set to channel 4. Unlike Atari's previous video game systems, the Video Music system's switch box featured a 75 Ohm pass-through F connector allowing the television antenna or cable to remain attached and thereby eliminating the tiresome process of detaching and reattaching the cable every time the user switched from watching normal television broadcasts to using the visualizer. Any audio source may be used for visualization including Atari's video game system audio, and visualizations can either be watched \\"live\\" on a television screen or recorded on a VCR by using a balun converter.  Technical details  The Video Music hooks up to a TV through an RF switchbox. The other hook ups are left and right RCA jack inputs that hook up to an audio amplifier's RCA outputs. The face is a brushed metal plate and the sides are particle board with walnut veneer. The unit is turned on by pushing a power button, and visualization is controlled by five potentiometer knobs and 12 additional push-buttons. The knob controls are as follows: * \`Gain\`: Two knobs controlling the left and right audio input signals strength. These increase the size of the visual pattern. * \`Color\`: One knob controlling color. This increases the number of available colors from a solid color to a rainbow of colors. * \`Contour\`: Two knobs controlling the left and right audio input signals visual representations shapes from soft to geometric. These act to soften shapes or increase geometric complexity of the design. The push button controls are as follows: * \`Power\`: Turns unit on and off. * \`Shape (solid)\`: Any Shape or Image that is displayed will be solid * \`Shape (hole)\`: One stereo channel controls the outside with a hole in the center controlled by the other stereo channel. * \`Shape (ring)\`: Both stereo channels will represent two outline shapes that retain their thickness with the pulse of the music * \`Shape (auto)\`: The system automatically cycles at random between the different Shape settings as well as the next eight buttons: * \`Horizontal 1\`: Displays one generated image. * \`Horizontal 2\`: Displays two horizontal generated images * \`Horizontal 4\`: Displays four horizontal generated images * \`Horizontal 5\`: Displays five horizontal generated images * \`Vertical 1\`: Displays one generated image * \`Vertical 2\`: Displays two vertical generated images * \`Vertical 4\`: Displays four vertical generated images * \`Vertical 8\`: Displays eight vertical generated images The last four buttons have an auxiliary function when the \\"Auto\\" button is pushed. In this mode, three of these buttons represent Solid, Hole and Ring. When the unit is in auto, it will retain the shape of one of those three shapes. The fourth button is \\"Auto All\\". This sends the unit into semi-automatic mode, cycling through shape, horizontal and vertical options but not affecting the user-set gain, color or contour settings.  Development history  Developed under the codename Project Mood, the Video Music unit was designed by Robert Brown, a developer of the home version of Pong. According to Atari design engineer, Al Alcorn, when Atari was on tour promoting the device, a Sears representative asked what the developers were smoking when they invented it. With that, a technician stepped forward holding up a lit joint.Bloom, Steve. \\"The incredible, incredible story of Atari ‚Äî from a $500 lark to a $2 billion business in 10 short years\\". Landley.net reprint accessed 28 April 2015. In March 1978, the unit was described in under the name \\"Audio activated video display\\"., Audio activated video display, Inventor(s): Brown Robert J, Applicant(s): ATARI INC, 1978-03-28, Espacenet - Patent Search, Abstract:An interface unit for providing visual color display of objects on an unaltered TV receiver which are directly associated with the music on an audio source. Audio energy is derived from separate channels of a stereo system. This audio information is presented on the screen in the form of objects in various arrangements. Color is derived based on the zero crossing rate of each channel. Each channel has its own color associated with it. Objects may be solid, or rings, or one may be \\"subtracted\\" one from the other. If desired, the different arrays may be selected automatically in a random manner. A spectral color modulator using phase shifted techniques is incorporated. It is considered to have been commercially unsuccessful and production was discontinued after only one year on the market.  Reception  The Video Music system was reviewed in Video magazine as part of a special \\"VideoTest Report\\" in 1978. The reviewers gave it mild but positive coverage, describing it as \\"a well-constructed machine and an interesting component to be used as an adjunct to stereo sound,\\" but warning that \\"once the novelty wears off the display can become somewhat monotonous.\\" The same report recommended it for \\"those who find it relaxing, stimulating, or therapeutic to watch psychedelic displays.\\"  Appearance in popular culture  *Devo used a Video Music screen as a background in the video for \\"The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprise\\". It appears again, connected to a vocoder, in the music video for \\"Beautiful World\\". *Daft Punk used a screen in their video \\"Robot Rock\\". *The diamond pattern visuals from Video Music can be seen in several scenes from the 1979 movie Over the Edge where the mute character Johnny watches the visuals in his bedroom. *The diamond pattern visuals from Video Music appeared in an episode of The X-Files (Season 1 Episode 7, \\"Ghost in the Machine\\") as part of a video surveillance system.

The series is ghostwritten from the original idea by Ziegesar.https://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/books/12058/index2.html The series, aimed toward young adults, is a spin-off from the bestselling Gossip Girl series. It was released in 2006 by Little, Brown. Plot summary As punishment for being off-campus (and having a party), the girls are split up into separate rooms: Callie and Jenny are kept in their original room while Tinsley and Brett move to another. They spend most of their time and energy avoiding each other. Callie tries to deal with her breakup but is surprised when Easy asks her to go to dinner with him and his father during Trustee's Weekend because his father adores Callie and is unaware that they have broken up. Easy, who does not get along with his father, hopes to protect Jenny from his overly critical nature and believes that taking Callie would be much simpler. Callie accepts his invitation but wonders if it means that Easy is having second thoughts about their breakup. Jenny, on the other hand, is blissfully unaware of Easy's action and continues to spend time with Brett, who decides to finally lose her virginity with her boyfriend Jeremiah Mortimer during Trustee's Weekend, after a big football game for St. Lucius. However, Tinsley helps Heath Ferro and the hot new freshman, Julian hide kegs of beer on the roof of the Dumbarton dorm and under the bed of a quiet girl who lives in a single known as The Girl In Black. After the boys leave, Tinsley throws and all girls party on the roof for all of the Dumbarton residents (excluding Brett and Jenny). Unfortunately, a staff member passing by hears the girls on the roof and attempts to a stop to it. All the girls quickly hide in their respective rooms so no one can be blamed but the administration insists that the keg left on the roof is more than enough to hold against the dorm as a whole. Due to the Trustee Weekend event, the administration does not want to draw too much attention to the incident so the punishment is light- all Dumbarton residents are under lockdown for the weekend. No one can enter or leave the dorm, thus ruining Brett's plans with Jeremiah. Upon hearing this, the guys of Waverly decide to make history by sneaking into Dumbarton while it is still on lock-down through secret tunnels built during the Cold War. Led by Heath Ferro, Easy Walsh, Brandon Buchanan, Alan St. Girard, Jeremiah Mortimer, and Julian McCafferty make it to Dumbarton unseen by the administration. Upon arrival, they break out the kegs stored under The Girl In Black's room, who turns out to be Kara Whalen, a previously chubby girl who was teased mercilessly by Heath Ferro her freshman year. In the spirit of generosity, Tinsley suggests that the girls of Dumbarton open their closets to the other residents so everyone can borrow each other's clothes. Tinsley, on a hunt for the hottest threads, checks on the kegs in Kara's room and discovers Kara has a fantastic wardrobe, thanks to her designer mother. She offers to help Kara with her make up but quickly forgets as the party begins. Jenny and Easy are reunited at the party but he still doesn't mention his dinner with his father and Callie the previous night before. Jenny leaves him in her room to grab drinks but a rumor quickly spreads that a teacher is roaming the hallways. He hides in the closet but is found by Callie who joins him. After she does so, the two begin to kiss but Easy realizes he has strong feelings for Jenny but is confused as to why he is still so attracted to Callie. Jenny, in the meanwhile, gets pulled into Kara's room after the rumors of a teacher in Dumbarton reach her. Kara and Jenny become fast friends and begin to chat when they are interrupted by Heath Ferro, who is looking for a place to hide as well. Heath is immediately attracted to Kara and does not recognize her as 'The Whale', the nickname he gave her freshman year and attempts to pick her up. Kara, however, is unimpressed and throws her mug of beer into Heath's face, making her one of the coolest chicks at the party. Brandon, unaware of the rumors about a teacher, bumps into Elizabeth Jacobs, a girl from St. Lucius. It quickly becomes apparent that the rumors about a teacher are actually about Elizabeth who has followed Jeremiah from St. Lucius. Brandon and Elizabeth quickly bond as they go around the rooms and coax the residents to continue partying as there is no threat of a teacher. Brett and Jeremiah quickly find each other at the beginning of the party and are about to have sex when they are interrupted by Tinsley who announces a game of 'I Never' is starting in the common room. Deciding to forgo sex for a more romantic occasion, Jeremiah and Brett agree to join the game. During the game, Yvonne Stidder starts with saying that she has never had sex before. The people who have done it, quickly do a shot, led by Heath Ferro. Surprisingly, Jeremiah and Elizabeth each do a shot which causes Brett and Jeremiah to break up. Shockingly, Tinsley, who has implied that she has had sex multiple times, does not take a shot (thus, revealing she is a virgin) which prompts accusations from her friends that she is a liar. Unwilling to be thrown into the spotlight for the wrong reasons, Tinsley announces in front of everybody that Easy took Callie to the Trustee Dinner instead of Jenny. Which prompts Jenny to flee the room. Callie becomes angry at Tinsley for revealing such a big secret in front of everyone, even though she hoped it would cause Easy and Jenny to break up, and reconciles with Brett who is with Kara, comforting Jenny. Jenny, to Callie's surprise, forgives her and both girls await Easy's next move. After the game of I Never, the party slows down considerably as the party-goers gossip about the recent events. During so, Elizabeth and Brandon sneak off to the tunnels and make out which makes Brandon believe that he is finally over Callie.

Knopf, Inc., New York 1956 The opening also features in Jesper Who Herded the Hares. Synopsis A king's daughter was ill, and it was foretold she would be made well by eating an apple. The king declared that whoever brought the apple to cure her would marry her. A peasant with three sons sent the oldest, Uele, with a basket of apples. He met a little iron man who asked him what was in the basket and said \\"Frogs' legs.\\" The man said that so it was, and when he reached the king, it did contain frogs' legs. The king drove him out. The peasant sent his second son, Seame, who answered \\"Hogs' bristles\\", made the same discovery and received the same reception. The youngest son, Hans, who was rather a fool, begged to go too, until his father let him. When he met the iron man, he said the basket contained the apples which the princess would eat to make herself well. The iron man said that it was so. The basket held apples when he reached the castle, and the princess was cured. The king, however, refused to let them marry until he had a boat that traveled over dry land and sea. Hans went home and told his father. His father sent Uele to the forest to make such a ship; the iron man came to him and asked what he was making; when Uele said \\"Wooden bowls\\" that was what he made. Seame suffered the same fate, but when Hans told the iron man he was making a ship that would travel over land and sea, he made such a boat. The king set Hans to watch a hundred hares in a meadow all day. Hans did so, not losing any. The king sent a maid to beg one from him, for guests. Hans refused it, but said he would give one to the king's daughter. Then the iron man gave him a whistle that would summon any hare back. Hans gave the king's daughter a hare but then whistled it back. The king sent Hans to fetch him a feather from the griffin's tail. On the way, a lord of a castle asked him to ask the griffin where was the lost key to his money chest; another lord, how their ill daughter could be cured; a giant, why he had to carry people over a lake. At the griffin's castle, he met the griffin's wife, who warned him that the griffin would eat him, but at night, he could pull out a feather, and then she would get the answers for him. Hans did as she said, and when he pulled the feather, the griffin woke. The wife told him that a man had been there and gone away, but told her some stories first. She repeated them, and the griffin said that the key was in the wood house, under a log; that a toad had made a nest of the daughter's hair, but she would recover if they took the hair out; that the giant had only to put someone down in the middle of the lake and he would be free. Hans left and told the other lords what he had learned; they gave him rich treasures. When he reached the king, he claimed the griffin had given them. The king set out to get some, but he was the first man to reach the giant, who put him down in the lake, where he drowned. Hans married the princess and became king.

Background Dr. Q was brought before the Discipline Committee of the British Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons for having sexual relations with a patient. The patient had originally sought help in 1994 for depression. By 1995 the two began sexual relations. Dr. Q denied any misconduct. The Committee found that Dr. Q was guilty of infamous misconduct. The Committee based its decision on the weight of the patient's testimony, ignoring Dr. Q's testimony. The Committee applied a standard of \\"clear and cogent evidence\\". Dr. Q applied for judicial review of the decision arguing that the wrong standard was applied. Decision Chief Justice McLachlin, writing for the Court, allowed the appeal and reinstated the order. She found that the standard of \\"clear and cogent evidence\\" was the appropriate standard. On the issue of standard of review, McLachlin reiterated the three degrees of deference available, correctness, reasonableness simpliciter, and patent unreasonableness. She considered what degree of deference was required in these circumstances based on the four factors of the \\"pragmatic and functional approach\\".para. 26 On the whole, the Committee decisions were to be reviewed on a standard of \\"reasonableness\\". Under the reasonableness standard, the reviewing judge's view of the evidence is beside the point.41 Instead, the court should only ask whether there is some basis in evidence to support the conclusion.

Range The range of the Neuse River waterdog is limited to the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River basins in the eastern Piedmont and Coastal Plain of North Carolina. Appearance and physiology N. lewisi has a rusty-brown dorsal side with many large, bluish- black spots. The ventral side is dark brown to grey and also spotted. The snout is compressed dorsally and truncated. The tail is compressed laterally and ridged. Each hind limb has four toes, and the gills are dull red and bushy. Sexually active males have sowled cloacae and two enlarged cloacal papillae that point to the rear. Males and females are of a similar size. Adults measure 16.5‚Äì28.0 cm from the tip of snout to tip of tail. The young possess a dorsal stripe along their length along with a dark lateral stripe. Males and females become sexually mature after reaching 102 mm and 100 mm, respectively, measured from tip of the snout to the posterior end of the cloaca. This size is reached at 5.5 years in males and 6.5 years in females. Habitat Neuse River waterdogs prefer streams with a flow >10 cm/s and streams which are >15 m wide, and 1 m deep, in areas with a hard clay or soil bottom, as well as areas covered with leaf bed. Larvae are found in leaf beds of quieter waters which provide cover and foraging sites. Males have a greater range than females, and both males and females increase their range after moderate rains, but decrease it after large rains (>40 mm). During winter, adults mostly reside in burrows in banks or under granite rocks. During the spring, the adults move to large bedrock outcrops or beneath large boulders in relatively fast current where nesting occurs. Home ranges contain animal burrows or rock overhangs, large flat rocks on sand gravel substrates, and slack-water areas with detritus mats of leaves. Adults create retreats by shoveling sand and gravel with their snouts, forming a cavity beneath cover objects. Sometimes, gravel is picked up in the mouth and moved to the periphery of the retreat. Entrances to these retreats face downstream. Females, and to a lesser extent males, actively defend their retreats from intruders. Threat displays include flaring and pulsating the gills and curling the upper lip. Intruders which do not flee after this display are attacked and bitten, usually on the end of the tail. Reproduction Males have sperm in the vasa deferentia from November through May, and females have been found with this sperm from December through May. Females move to nesting sites beneath fast-moving current during the spring. Oviposition occurs in April and May, corresponding to the time when ovarian eggs reach their maximum size. Eggs are 8‚Äì9 mm in diameter and attach to the substrate by a blunt stalk. Courtship A pair of Neuse River waterdogs crawl slowly, with the male trailing the female by 2‚Äì4 cm. The male positions his snout behind the rear legs of the female when she stops. The female has her gills flared, while the male has his close to the neck. The male then moves across her body at the base of her tail. Once parallel, the male begins to stroke the female with his chin. This stroking begins at the top of the head, moves roughly halfway down the female and back to the head. The female then raises her head each time the male's chin contacts her neck or head. This sequence repeats many times over a period of roughly 18 minutes. The male then circles the female in a clockwise direction while maintaining contact with her. After several slow circles are made, the males moves parallel to the female and places his limbs over her back. The pair remains in this position for 30 minutes and retreats. Diet and feeding Adults feed from the mouths of their retreats or move about in search of prey at night. Olfaction and sight play important roles in locating food. Animals are active away from cover at night, and also during raised water levels and increased turbidity. Individuals are inactive when stream temperatures exceed 18 ¬∞C. Adults mainly prey on snails, earthworms, isopods, amphipods, mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, true flies, and fish. Other prey include: slugs, leeches, spiders, crayfish, centipedes, millipedes, odonates, hellgrammites, beetles, caterpillars, and salamanders. Prey of larvae are mainly ostracods, copepods, mayflies, true flies, and beetles. Other prey items of larva include: earthworms, caldocerans, isopods, amphipods, collembolans, odonates, and stoneflies along with other insects. Predation Mainly preyed on by fish, Neuse River waterdogs produce chemical defenses to ward off these predators. References *Petranka, James W.

She goes out into the countryside to see what might happen. She gives a hungry man her bread, and to three cold children she gives her cap, her jacket, and her dress. After wandering into a forest, she sees a naked child begging for a shift (long undergarment), and since it is dark and she cannot be seen, she gives her own away. As she stands there with nothing left at all, suddenly stars fall to earth before her, transforming into talers (silver coins), and she finds herself wearing a new shift of the finest linen. The story ends with her being rich.  Other adaptations  There is another known version of this tale. It tells of a beautiful young girl named Natalie whose parents have fallen ill. She is sent to find a doctor, and meets many begging people along the way. She gives away everything but her shift, and when in the forest she meets yet another begging child asking for her shift. Natalie strips naked and gives her shift away, and then ends up spending three days and nights in the forest. On the fourth day, she is swimming in the lake and is greeted by her guardian angel, who tells her soon her generosity shall be rewarded. With that she leaves a towel and a clean set of clothing for Natalie. After Natalie dries herself and dresses again, the guardian angel sends stars falling from the sky before her, proven to be silver talers. Natalie gathers them up and after heading back to the village, she pays the doctor, and all goes well for her family, now that they are wealthy.

To date, this monotypic genus is only represented by Ichthyolestes pinfoldi. Like other members of the Family Pakicetidae, which are considered the earliest and least specialized of the archaic cetaceans, Ichthyolestes represents an early quadrupedal phase of the land-to-sea transition which occurs in the cetacean lineage.  Discovery and Classification  I. pinfoldi was initially known only from teeth, which were found in the Eocene locality Ganda Kas, Pakistan. Upon their discovery, I. pinfoldi was placed within the Family Mesonychidae, a group of terrestrial mammals from which cetaceans were previously thought to have evolved. Due to morphological distinctions from other mesonychids, I. pinfoldi was later acknowledged and described as an archaeocete, making it the first Pakicetid to be described. Cranial and postcranial material of I. pinfoldi have also been found in the Kuldana Formation, Pakistan, from the early-middle Eocene, and from the Subathu sediments of Jammu and Kashmir, India.  Description  Ichthyolestes is the smallest Pakicetid, approximately 29% smaller than Pakicetus, and has been considered ‚Äúfox-sized.‚Äù They retain many features typical of terrestrial Eocene artiodactyls, including long and gracile limb bones, a fused sacrum, small mandibular foramen, and no cranial telescoping. The body plan of Ichthyolestes is generally similar to Pakicetus, but smaller and more gracile. Therefore, locomotion is also thought to be reliant on quadrupedal paddling.  Teeth  Ichthyolestes exhibits heterodont and diphyodont dentition with cusped cheek teeth. The upper second molar has pointed cusps with a high narrow paracone and a lower connate metacone behind it. The molars are also relatively labio-lingually compressed with serrated crests along the labial cusps.254x254px  Cranial  Ichthyolestes has dorsally oriented eyes and a narrow skull, which is smaller than the skulls of both Pakicetus and Nalacetus. Like other Pakicetids, Ichthyolestes lacks a supraorbital shield; however, there is some variation in supraorbital morphology between the three genera. The supraorbital region of Ichthyolestes and Pakicetus is cup-like and cradles the dorsal portion of the eye. Ichthyolestes also has a weaker incisure on the dorsal side of the supraorbital region compared to Pakicetus. All three Pakicetid taxa largely retained the peripheral ear morphology of terrestrial mammals, but likely used bone conducting mechanisms when hearing underwater. The tympanic bulla also differs between Pakicetid taxa. The absolute size of Ichthyolestes tympanic bulla is smaller than either Pakicetus or Nalacetus; but when compared relative to their body size, the tympanic bulla of Ichthyolestes is proportionally larger than that of Pakicetus. The semicircular canal system of the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear, which is involved in neural control of locomotion, is similar in size to that of Eocene artiodactyls. They do not show the size reduction as seen in other Pakicetids and Eocene cetaceans like Remingtonocetus, Indocetus, and Dorudon, which have canal sizes within the upper range of modern cetaceans. This suggests that Ichthyolestes had not fully invaded aquatic ecosystems and still remained somewhat terrestrial.  Postcranial  Although Ichthyolestes is the smallest Pakicetid, some features are larger or more robust than Nalacetus, such as the astragalus, calcaneus, and pelvis. Ichthyolestes also has proportionally longer lumbar and caudal vertebrae relative to its shorter limb segments. Ichthyolestes also has long digits and strong post-thoracic vertebrae. The sacrum is composed of four elongate vertebrae with complete fusion, except for the spinous processes of S2 to S4 which are columnar with smooth ventral faces. The lumbar vertebrae are narrower and shallower to Pakicetus and Nalacetus. Although still relatively large compared to other related taxa, the atlas vertebrae of Ichthyolestes is smaller and more gracile than Pakicetus or Nalacetus, and the neural canal is disproportionately large.  Terrestrial or Semi-aquatic Locomotion  The astragalus bone, which is present in the ankle of artiodactyls and archaic whales that retained feet, has similar dimensions in both Eocene artiodactyls and Ichtyolestes. In addition to lending evidence to the theory of a direct relationship between artiodactyls and cetaceans, this knowledge has led to two competing hypotheses about the locomotion of Ichtyolestes and other Pakicetids. The first states that Ichtyolestes and Pakicetus were terrestrial and cursorial, implying that aquatic locomotor adaptation occurred after the origin of Cetacea. The second states that Ichtyolestes and Pakicetus were already semi-aquatic and cetaceans originated from an earlier unknown Eocene artiodactyl, such as Elomeryx or Indohyus, implying that aquatic locomotor adaptations occurred before or during the origin of Cetacea. Although the postcranial anatomy of Ichtyolestes is similar to that of Eocene artiodactyls and implies cursoriality, the assessment of bone morphology and microstructure indicate that they, and other Pakicetids, were semi-aquatic like Protocetids. Hypermineralization occurs in all regions of the skeleton; in particular, the long bones and ribs had small or absent marrow cavities due to the thick cortices which developed. Hypermineralization of load-bearing skeletal elements put Ichtyolestes at an increased risk of fractures during prolonged terrestrial loading and this risk increased with velocity, implying that terrestriality was limited. Additionally, the dense skeletons may have allowed bottom-walking or wading in shallow pools as it would counteract buoyancy created by inflated lungs and fur-trapped air. Therefore, the retention of an artiodactyl-like astragalus does not signify full terrestriality or cursoriality in Ichtyolestes.  Paleoenvironment  Pakicetid fossils, including those of Ichthyolestes, are usually found around river channel deposits, not marine deposits or fauna. The regions around northern Pakistan and northwest India, where fossils have been recovered, are thought to have been an arid environment with ephemeral streams and moderately developed floodplains. Ichthyolestes, therefore, had an affinity for water and were either terrestrial or semi-aquatic. The fluvial facies of the lower Kuldana Formation represent shallow tropical riverine complexes and were likely habitats for the initial stages of transition into water.

The \\"factory\\" trading post is on the left. The Treaty of Fort Clark (also known as the Treaty with the Osage or the Osage Treaty) was signed at Fort Osage (then called Fort Clark) on November 10, 1808, (ratified on April 28, 1810) in which the Osage Nation ceded all the land east of the fort in Missouri and Arkansas north of the Arkansas River to the United States. The Fort Clark treaty and the Treaty of St. Louis in which the Sac (tribe) and Fox (tribe) ceded northeastern Missouri along with northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin were the first two major treaties in the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase. The affected tribes, upset with the terms, were to side with the British in the War of 1812. Following the settlement of that war, John C. Sullivan for the United States was to survey the ceded land in 1816 (adjusting it 23 miles westward to the mouth of the Kansas River to create the Indian Boundary Line west of which and south of which virtually all tribes were to be removed in the Indian Removal Act in 1830. Background When Lewis and Clark began their explorations of the Missouri River in 1804, Pierre Chouteau of the Chouteau fur trading family in St. Louis, Missouri took Osage chiefs to meet Thomas Jefferson who promised to open a government sanctioned trading post (then called the factory which the Osage could sell their goods at a government set price (ostensibly to keep them from being exploited by individual traders). The trading post would also have a blacksmith to provide utensils for the Native Americans. In early 1808, Meriwether Lewis led a group to the site of Fort Osage near Sibley, Missouri where they built the fort on a bluff above the Missouri River. Pierre Chouteau went about 150 miles south to Neosho, Missouri where the Osage had their principal village on the Osage River and brought the chiefs to Fort Osage. There they were presented with the terms of the treaty. Terms=Ceded land The treaty specifically cedes the following land: :And in consideration of the advantages which we derive from the stipulations contained in the foregoing articles, we, the chiefs and warriors of the Great and Little Osage, for ourselves and our nations respectively, covenant and agree with the United States, that the boundary line between our nations and the United States shall be as follows, to wit: beginning at fort Clark, on the Missouri, five miles above Fire Prairie, and running thence a due south course to the river Arkansas, and down the same to the Mississippi; hereby ceding and relinquishing forever to the United States, all the lands which lie east of the said line, and north of the southwardly bank of the said river Arkansas, and all lands situated northwardly of the river Missouri. And we do further cede and relinquish to the United States forever, a tract of two leagues square, to embrace fort Clark, and to be laid off in such manner as the President of the United States shall think proper. Payment According to the Article V, the Osage were to receive an annual payment: :Great Osage nation, the sum of eight hundred dollars [$13,559.32 today], and to the Little Osage nation, the sum of four hundred dollars[$6,779.66 today]. Ceded lands In Article VI the lands ceded: :Beginning at fort Clark, on the Missouri, five miles above Fire Prairie, and running thence a due south course to the river Arkansas, and down the same to the Mississippi; hereby ceding and relinquishing forever to the United States, all the lands which lie east of the said line, and north of the southwardly bank of the said river Arkansas, and all lands situated northwardly of the river Missouri. And we do further cede and relinquish to the United States forever, a tract of two leagues square, to embrace fort Clark, and to be laid off in such manner as the President of the United States shall think proper. Assignment to other tribes Article VIII provided that the Osage land could be assigned to other tribes: :And the United States agree that such of the Great and Little Osage Indians, as may think proper to put themselves under the protection of fort Clark, and who observe the stipulations of this treaty with good faith, shall be permitted to live and to hunt, without molestation, on all that tract of country, west of the north and south boundary line, on which they, the said Great and Little Osage, have usually hunted or resided: Provided, The same be not the hunting grounds of any nation or tribe of Indians in amity with the United States; and on any other lands within the territory of Louisiana, without the limits of the white settlements, until the United States may think proper to assign the same as hunting grounds to other friendly Indians. Aftermath There were protests immediately from the tribe as there were claims that not all the proper representatives signed the document. The Osage for the most part did not move to Fort Osage staying instead at their home in Neosho. Some tribesmen were to side with the British in the War of 1812. After the war, the Osage were summoned to Portage Des Sioux, Missouri where they affirmed the treaty in the Treaties of Portage des Sioux in 1815.

The station, which is owned by Renda Broadcasting, operates at 101.9 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW. This power gives it one of the best radio signals in all of Southwest Florida. Its transmitter is located off Corkscrew Road in Estero. This incredible signal also has its disadvantages, having exceptional interference with 101.9 \\"FM 101.9\\" WQMP, an Alternative Rock station licensed to Daytona Beach, but serves Orlando. The Sebring, Tampa, St. Petersburg, and Avon Park areas are the most affected by this interference with powerful radios receiving those two stations almost as one. History WWGR signed on in 1969 as WHEW-FM, and was a station that targeted the greater Fort Myers area as a Country station during the 1970s and 1980s. During that time, the station struggled to find a strong hold on the market's country music listeners. That coupled with the increased competition from WCKT made it a very tough course for the station to sustain. In the 1990s, WHEW-FM transformed to what is currently WWGR when the station was bought by Renda Broadcasting. Immediately following the sale of the station, the station took over the name Gator Country 101.9 Music, \\"Southwest Florida's Country Station\\". In April 2013, two presenters at WWGR told listeners dihydrogen monoxide, a scientific description of water, was coming out of their water taps as part of an April Fool's Day hoax and were suspended for a few days by the station's general manager, Tony Renda. Renda later told NewsPress: \\"It is one thing when radio stations change their format or other crazy things they do. But you are messing with one of the big three, food, water or shelter. They just went too far; I just knew I didn't like that.\\" The prank resulted in several calls by consumers to the local utility company, which sent out a release stating that the water was safe. WWGR today In 2005, WWGR moved from its home in Fort Myers to Bonita Springs just across the street from the Naples-Fort Myers Greyhound Track. This new building houses WWGR and sister stations WSGL, WJGO, and WGUF.

It is an early-modern building in western Ohio, designed by Chicago architect Louis Sullivan, the mentor of Frank Lloyd Wright. It was designed and built in 1917 for use by Peoples Federal Savings and Loan Association, which still operates out of it. It is one of a handful of banks designed by Sullivan between 1908 and 1919 for small communities in the central United States. The building is a National Historic Landmark. Description and history People's Federal Savings and Loan Association is located at 101 East Court Street on the corner of South Ohio Street in Sidney across from the Spot restaurant. It lies also across the street from the Gothic revival Monumental Building and the Second Empire-style Shelby County Courthouse. Numerous colors adorn the building, beginning with the corbels of multicolored terracotta, which are placed over the front windows. A dominant Romanesque Revival archway forms the main entrance, set in a building base of black marble and amid walls of strong reds. Other parts of the walls are pierced by numerous windows featuring blue, green, and purple glasswork. The design is the result of Sullivan's architectural ideal: simple structurally but ornately decorated in their details.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1273. The Sidney People's Federal Savings and Loan Association was one of a series of commissions that architect Louis Sullivan took on late in his career. These commissions resulted in a collection of bank buildings that have been termed \\"jewel boxes\\" for their modest size and ornate appearance. According to one account of the creation of Sullivan's design, he produced a sketch of it after two days of observing the empty lot where it was to stand. The sketch was at first rejected by the bank directors, who expressed a desire for a more conventional design with Classical features. Sullivan observed that they could have hired any of \\"a thousand architects to design a classic bank\\", but that only he could produce this type of design. The building was completed for $1,000 less than Sullivan's estimated cost.

Located in strata of the Santonian Bajo de la Carpa Formation, the original remains were discovered by Oscar de Ferrariis, Director of the Natural History Museum of the Comahue National University in Neuqu√©n around 1984‚Äì5. He passed them onto noted paleontologist Jos√© Bonaparte, who described the species Patagopteryx deferrariisi in 1992. Characteristics The Patagopteryx had feet with fused bones, much like modern birds. The bird did not have a wishbone, meaning that it would have been impossible for it to have had the muscles necessary for flying. The legs had very short femurs, characteristic of a running animal. The second toe has a curved claw, but it does not appear to have been used as a weapon. It was omnivorous, and probably traveled in flocks across the plains of South America.

The body had 11 segments indicated by 4 turberculates on each of them, associated with 11 pairs of lateral swimming lobes with gill-like structure, along with 11 pairs of small legs (lobopods) at the lobes' bases. The body ends with a single tail spine which formerly thought to be a pair of cerci. It also had well-developed pharynx and arthropod-like gut glands. The spiny frontal appendages suggest that it may have been a predator; however, fossils indicate total size of approximately 175 mm and, with a relatively small mouth, indicating that it would have been restricted to very small prey.

The Basilica of Guadalupe or Santuario de Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe, has a fifty five gold crowns inside. is a Roman Catholic church located in the metropolitan area of Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico. Standing in the neighborhood of Colonia Independencia, just outside the city's downtown area, the temple is one of the larger Church edifices in northern Mexico. It is dedicated to Virgin Mary in her guise as Our Lady of Guadalupe, the Patroness of America, who appeared to St Juan Diego on Tepeyac Hill outside Mexico City in 1531. It is smaller than its counterpart, the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, which without a doubt enjoys a more national and international fame. Year after year, the church becomes the destination for thousands of faithfuls devoted to the Virgin, especially on the days prior to her feast day, December 12. On that date, beginning at the stroke of midnight leading into the 12th, mariachis play and sing traditional songs, or the ma√±anitas, paying tribute to the Virgin. Usually, the weeks prior to Our Lady's holiday, pilgrimages are made by peregrinos who arrive praying or chanting, and matachines who dance all the way up to the basilica. They all emerge from various directions to converge onto the church to pray and hear Mass in front of the copy of the image of the Guadalupana. The original is in the Mexico City basilica. Other notable Catholic churches in the area are: Catedral de Monterrey (The Monterrey Cathedral), La Basilica de la Pur√≠sima Concepcion - commonly known as \\"La Purisima\\", Capilla de los Dulces Nombres (the Chapel of the Sweet Names), San Juan Bautista de La Salle, Basilica de Nuestra Senora del Roble, El Sagrado Corazon (Sacred Heart) and the Antigua Basilica de Guadalupe (Old Basilica).

The UPZ provides guidance, education, and resources to students who seek to contribute a progressive voice into the campus debate concerning Israel and Palestine. As of January 2007, the Union of Progressive Zionists had chapters at 60 colleges and universities. In May 2009, the Union of Progressive Zionists affiliated itself with J Street and became J Street U. History The Union of Progressive Zionists was created in the early 2000s by college-age members of Habonim Dror and Hashomer Hatzair, with the support of what was then known as Labor Zionist Alliance (and now Ameinu) and what was then known as Meretz USA (now Partners for Progressive Israel), two US Progressive Zionist organizations. UPZ's first national conference, held in October 2004, drew more than 100 students from 40 schools. From its founding, the stated intention of the group was to create a network of student activists who supported Israel and opposed the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories but felt alienated by both pro- Israel and pro-Palestinian extremists. Activities The Union of Progressive Zionists has brought prominent leftist Israeli politicians to speak on North American campuses, including Yossi Beilin, chairman of the Meretz-Yachad party and one of the architects of the Oslo Accords and the Geneva Accords; Yael Dayan, Deputy Mayor of Tel Aviv-Yafo and an advocate for women's rights and gay rights; Daniel Levy, the lead Israeli drafter of the Geneva Accords. Its speakers have also included prominent Palestinians such as Amjad Atallah, the Palestinian-American legal advisor to the Palestinian negotiating team in peace talks with Israel, and Rafi Dajani, Executive Director of the American Task Force on Palestine.Previous Events , Union of Progressive Zionists. Controversy within the Israel On Campus Coalition In late 2006 and early 2007, the campus activities of the Union of Progressive Zionists created a stir within the Israel On Campus Coalition, an organization that seeks to promote a \\"pro-active pro-Israel agenda on campus,\\" of which the UPZ was a member. [J Street U, the successor to UPZ, still works with the IOCC.] Some of the coalition's more conservative members, such as the mainstream American Jewish Congress (AJCongress) and the small right-wing group Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), criticized the UPZ for sponsoring speeches by members of an Israeli organization, Breaking the Silence, former soldiers who speak out against human rights abuses they have witnessed in the Israeli- occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. In December 2006, the ZOA called for the Israel On Campus Coalition to expel the Union of Progressive Zionists. Although the coalition's steering committee voted 9‚Äì0 against expulsion in January 2007, the issue resulted in a debate among major Zionist organizations. The Jewish National Fund joined the ZOA in demanding that the UPZ to end its relationship with Breaking the Silence (but not in calling for the group's exclusion from the coalition), and the World Zionist Organization supported the UPZ, as did a group of 100 academics from Israel. The AJCongress threatened to quit the coalition out of dissatisfaction with the decision to allow the UPZ to remain.

Its anatomy strongly suggests that it, along with its relative Kerygmachela kierkegaardi, was either an anomalocarid or a close relative thereof. P. whittingtoni had a pair of massive anterior limbs that corresponded to the feeding limbs of other anomalocarids. The anterior limbs had a row of flexible, hair-like spines that corresponded with each segment of each limb. Unlike K. kierkegaardi, P. whittingtoni's mouth was relatively large, though it does not appear to have any large biting surfaces like the mouth of Anomalocaris. It had 11 pairs of lateral lobes, and 11 pairs of relatively large, lobopod-like legs. None of the fossil specimens have any suggestion of posterior cerci, or tail-flaps. The massive anterior limbs, with their comb-like rows of spines, suggest that P. whittingtoni was a planktivore.

Her poetic work incorporates conceptual writing and trance, and her performances are rooted in feminist performance art and spoken word. Everywhere Here and in Brooklyn, I, Afterlife: Essay in Mourning Time, and Trance Poetics are among her poetic books.  Early Years  Prevallet grew up in Denver, CO. Her parents were both public school teachers. Before dying of cancer at the age of 46, her mother fulfilled her vows to become a Sister of Loretto. Prevallet studied poetics with Robert Creeley and media studies with Tony Conrad at the University at Buffalo. Since the early 1990s, she has been teaching writing and literature courses for a variety of universities and art institutions including Bard College's Writing and Thinking Workshop, Pratt Institute, Naropa University, Poet‚Äôs House, and The Poetry Project. From 2003-2006, she worked with Anne Waldman and Bob Holman to start a school for poets at the Bowery Poetry Club, the venue which defined the New York downtown poetry scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Writing  At the University of Buffalo, Prevallet catalogued the archive of Helen Adam and her scholarly archive is a part of The Poetry Collection. She edited the definitive volume of Helen Adam‚Äôs work (A Helen Adam Reader, published by the National Poetry Foundation), which contextualizes Helen Adam within Robert Duncan's circle in The San Francisco Renaissance, as well as Adam's influence on Allen Ginsberg and the Beat Generation. Prevallet's poem ‚ÄúLyric Infiltration‚Äù from her second book Scratch Sides: Poetry, Documentation and Image-Text Projects is analyzed by Redell Olson in ‚ÄúReading and Writing Through Found Materials: From Modernism to Contemporary Practice.‚Äù Olson writes, ‚ÄúThe use of the term ‚Äòcut- up‚Äô places Prevallet‚Äôs procedural work in relation to the strategies of previous writers such as Tristan Tzara, Brion Gysin, and the Oulipo founder Raymond Queneau, and can also be related to the chance-based operational writing of John Cage and Jackson Mac Low. The work of Prevallet is unusual in that it does not dispense with either the term ‚Äòlyric‚Äô or the process of lyric writing but uses it as a basis for her procedural work.‚Äù Elizabeth Jane Burnett describes her 2004 performance of ‚ÄúCruelty and Conquest‚Äù at Naropa University as ‚Äúplaying with audience response as a feminist poetry that explores the ways in which the body is transacted.‚Äù Her work has been published in numerous anthologies including The Body In Language (CounterPath Press, edited by Edwin Torres), I‚Äôll Drown My Book: Conceptual Writing By Women (University of Iowa Press), Women Poets on Mentorship: Efforts & Affections (Edited by Arielle Greenburg and Rachel Zucker, University of Iowa Press), and Telling it Slant: Avant-garde Poetics of the 1990s (edited by Mark Wallace, University of Alabama Press).

Walker founded a successful chain of small grocery stores that grew to include several dozen stores scattered throughout the Knoxville, Tennessee vicinity as well as parts of Virginia and Kentucky. From 1941 through 1971, Walker served on the Knoxville city council where he became legendary for his uncompromising political stances and his vehement opposition to what he claimed was a corrupt elitism in the city's government. The Cas Walker Farm and Home Hour, a local variety show sponsored by Walker, ran in various radio and television formats between 1929 and 1983 and helped launch the careers of entertainer Dolly Parton and the Everly Brothers. Early life Walker was born to a working-class family in Sevier County, Tennessee in 1902. He quit school at the age of 14 and spent several years working at different jobs around the region, namely at the Champion Fibre Company in North Carolina and later at various coal mines in Kentucky. In 1924, he returned to East Tennessee where he established the first Cas Walker's Cash Store in Knoxville with money he had saved.Ajay Kalra, \\"Cas Walker,\\" The Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 544-545.Carroll Van West, \\"Orton Caswell Walker.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 17 November 2008. Walker's stores had a simple rural atmosphere that was popular with the city's working class whites and African-Americans.William MacArthur, Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South (Tulsa, Okla.: Continental Heritage Press, 1982), pp. 148-150. He used his radio show and other innovative methods-- such as scattering coupons from airplanes-- to advertise his store's weekly specials. By the mid-1950s, Walker's chain had grown to include 27 stores that generated a gross annual revenue of $60 million. Politics Cas Walker display at the Museum of Appalachia Walker was first elected to the Knoxville city council in 1941. He was elected mayor in 1946, but after a few weeks of tumultuous meetings and the firing of its own city manager, the city council managed to oust Walker in a recall election. He also served as acting mayor in 1959.Mayors of Knoxville , Knoxville official website. Retrieved: 12 February 2013. Walker was reelected to the city council the following and remained until voluntarily retiring in 1971. He continued to be a force in Knoxville politics into the 1980s. As a politician, Walker successfully portrayed himself as a champion of small farmers and the working class. This image was enhanced in 1956 when Life Magazine published a photograph of Walker preparing to punch fellow city councilman J. S. Cooper after the two had engaged in a heated debate over property assessments.The photograph was published in Life Vol. 40, no. 12 (March 19, 1956), p. 38 (\\"A Look At the World's Week\\") and credited to Tom Greene, Jr. In his self-published newsletter, The Watchdog, Walker blasted political opponents and raged against tax increases. He also used The Watchdog to launch controversial attacks against his business competitors. In the 1960s, he unsuccessfully opposed plans to fluoridate Knoxville's water supply and played a pivotal role in derailing attempts to consolidate the governments of Knoxville and Knox County. Walker's political mentor-turned-rival, George Dempster, once said, \\"If I ordered a whole carload of SOB's and they just sent Cas, I'd sign for the shipment.\\"Bruce Wheeler, Knoxville, Tennessee: A Mountain City in the New South (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2005), p. 73. Walker continued distributing The Watchdog until the early 1980s, when a libel suit forced it out of publication. During the same period, Walker's influence helped defeat a second attempt to merge the Knoxville and Knox County governments. Radio and television In 1929, Walker created a variety show known as the Farm and Home Hour to help promote his cash stores. The show initially aired as a radio program on WROL-AM and later on WIVK-AM. In 1953, the show adopted a television format for WROL-TV (now WATE-TV) and aired on various local channels until 1983. The show featured artists such as Roy Acuff, Jimmy Martin, Bill Monroe, Carl Smith, Carl Butler, Jim Nabors, and Chet Atkins. The show also helped launch the careers of Dolly Parton, who first performed on the program in 1956 at the age of 10, and the Everly Brothers, who were regulars on the show in the mid-1950s.. 1999-2005.

Though STAT5A and STAT5B are encoded by separate genes, the proteins are 90% identical at the amino acid level. STAT5 proteins are involved in cytosolic signalling and in mediating the expression of specific genes. Aberrant STAT5 activity has been shown to be closely connected to a wide range of human cancers, and silencing this aberrant activity is an area of active research in medicinal chemistry.  Activation and function  In order to be functional, STAT5 proteins must first be activated. This activation is carried out by kinases associated with transmembrane receptors: * Ligands binding to these transmembrane receptors on the outside of the cell activate the kinases; * The stimulated kinases add a phosphate group to a specific tyrosine residue on the receptor; * STAT5 then binds to these phosphorylated-tyrosines using their SH2 domain (STAT domains illustrated below); * The bound STAT5 is then phosphorylated by the kinase, the phosphorylation occurring at particular tyrosine residues on the C-terminus of the protein; * Phosphorylation causes STAT5 to dissociate from the receptor; * The phosphorylated STAT5 finally goes on to form either homodimers, STAT5-STAT5, or heterodimers, STAT5-STATX, with other STAT proteins. The SH2 domains of the STAT5 proteins are once again used for this dimerization. STAT5 can also form homo-tetramers, usually in concert with the histone methyltransferase EZH2, and act as a transcriptional repressor. STAT5 activation. In the activation pathway illustrated to the left, the ligand involved is a cytokine and the specific kinase taking part in activation is JAK. The dimerized STAT5 represents the active form of the protein, which is ready for translocation into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the dimers bind to STAT5 response elements, inducing transcription of specific sets of genes. Upregulation of gene expression by STAT5 dimers has been observed for genes dealing with: * controlled cell growth and division, or cell proliferation * programmed cell death, or apoptosis * cell specialization, or differentiation and * inflammation. Activated STAT5 dimers are, however, short-lived and the dimers are made to undergo rapid deactivation. Deactivation may be carried out by a direct pathway, removing the phosphate groups using phosphatases like PIAS or SHP-2 for example, or by an indirect pathway, which involves reducing cytokine signalling.  STAT5 and cancer  STAT5 has been found to be constitutively phosphorylated in cancer cells, implying that the protein is always present in its active form. This constant activation is brought about either by mutations or by aberrant expressions of cell signalling, resulting in poor regulation, or complete lack of control, of the activation of transcription for genes influenced by STAT5. This leads to constant and increased expression of these genes. For example, mutations may lead to increased expression of anti-apoptotic genes, the products of which actively prevent cell death. The constant presence of these products preserve the cell in spite of it having become cancerous, causing the cell to eventually become malignant. Treatment approaches Attempts at treatment for cancer cells with constitutively phosphorylated STAT5 have included both indirect and direct inhibition of STAT5 activity. While more medicinal work has been done in indirect inhibition, this approach can lead to increased toxicity in cells and can also result in non-specific effects, both of which are better handled by direct inhibition. Indirect inhibition targets kinases associated with STAT5, or targets proteases that carry out terminal truncation of proteins. Different inhibitors have been designed to target different kinases: * inhibition of BCR/ABl constitutes the basis of the functioning of drugs like imatinib * inhibition of FLT3 is carried out by drugs like lestaurtinib * inhibition of JAK2 is carried out by the drug CYT387, which was successful in preclinical trials and is currently undergoing clinical trials. Domains of STAT proteins Direct inhibition of STAT5 activity makes use of small molecule inhibitors that prevent STAT5 from properly binding to DNA, or prevent proper dimerization. The inhibiting of DNA binding utilizes RNA interference, antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, and short hairpin RNA. The inhibition of proper dimerization, on the other hand, is brought about by the use of small molecules that target the SH2 domain. Recent work on drug development in the latter field have proved particularly effective.

It is a member of the STAT protein family.  Function  STAT3 is a member of the STAT protein family. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT3 is phosphorylated by receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAK), form homo- or heterodimers, and translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. Specifically, STAT3 becomes activated after phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 in response to such ligands as interferons, epidermal growth factor (EGF), Interleukin (IL-)5 and IL-6. Additionally, activation of STAT3 may occur via phosphorylation of serine 727 by Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and through c-src non-receptor tyrosine kinase.. STAT3 mediates the expression of a variety of genes in response to cell stimuli, and thus plays a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis. STAT3-deficient mouse embryos cannot develop beyond embryonic day 7, when gastrulation begins. It appears that at these early stages of development, STAT3 activation is required for self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Indeed, LIF, which is supplied to murine ESC cultures to maintain their undifferentiated state, can be omitted if STAT3 is activated through some other means. STAT3 is essential for the differentiation of the TH17 helper T cells, which have been implicated in a variety of autoimmune diseases. During viral infection, mice lacking STAT3 in T-cells display impairment in the ability to generate T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells and fail to maintain antibody based immunity.  Clinical significance  Loss-of-function mutations in the STAT3 gene result in Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome, associated with recurrent infections as well as disordered bone and tooth development. Gain-of-function mutations in the STAT3 gene have been reported to cause multi-organ early onset auto- immune diseases; such as thyroid disease, diabetes, intestinal inflammation, and low blood counts, while constitutive STAT3 activation is associated with various human cancers and commonly suggests poor prognosis. It has anti- apoptotic as well as proliferative effects. STAT3 can promote oncogenesis by being constitutively active through various pathways as mentioned elsewhere. A tumor suppressor role of STAT3 has also been reported. In the report on human glioblastoma tumor, or brain cancer, STAT3 was shown to have an oncogenic or a tumor suppressor role depending upon the mutational background of the tumor. A direct connection between the PTEN-Akt-FOXO axis (suppressive) and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta (LIFRbeta)-STAT3 signaling pathway (oncogenic) was shown. Increased activity of STAT3 in cancer cells, leads to changes in the function of protein complexes that control expression of inflammatory genes, with result profound change in the secretome and the cell phenotypes, their activity in the tumor, and their capacity for metastasis.  Interactions  STAT3 has been shown to interact with: * AR, * ELP2, * EP300, * EGFR, * HIF1A, * JAK1, * JUN * KHDRBS1, * mTOR, * MYOD1, * NDUFA13, * NFKB1, * NR3C1, * NCOA1, * PML, * RAC1, * RELA, * RET, * RPA2, * STAT1, * Stathmin, * Src, and * TRIP10. * KPNA4.

It is a member of the STAT protein family.  Function  All STAT molecules are phosphorylated by receptor associated kinases, that causes activation, dimerization by forming homo- or heterodimers and finally translocate to nucleus to work as transcription factors. Specifically STAT1 can be activated by several ligands such as Interferon alpha (IFNŒ±), Interferon gamma (IFNŒ≥), Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Platelet Derived GrowŒ±th Factor (PDGF), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), or IL-27 Type I interferons (IFN-Œ±, IFN-√ü) bind to receptors, cause signaling via kinases, phosphorylate and activate the Jak kinases TYK2 and JAK1 and also STAT1 and STAT2. STAT molecules form dimers and bind to ISGF3G/IRF-9, which is Interferon stimulated gene factor 3 complex with Interferon regulatory Factor 9. This allows STAT1 to enter the nucleus. STAT1 has a key role in many gene expressions that cause survival of the cell, viability or pathogen response. There are two possible transcripts (due to alternative splicing) that encode 2 isoforms of STAT1 STAT1 is involved in upregulating genes due to a signal by either type I, type II, or type III interferons. In response to IFN-Œ≥ stimulation, STAT1 forms homodimers or heterodimers with STAT3 that bind to the GAS (Interferon-Gamma-Activated Sequence) promoter element; in response to either IFN-Œ± or IFN-Œ≤ stimulation, STAT1 forms a heterodimer with STAT2 that can bind the ISRE (Interferon-Stimulated Response Element) promoter element. In either case, binding of the promoter element leads to an increased expression of ISG (Interferon-Stimulated Genes). Expression of STAT1 can be induced with diallyl disulfide, a compound in garlic.  Mutations of STAT1  Mutations in the STAT1 molecule can be gain of function (GOF) or loss of function (LOF). Both of them can cause different phenotypes and symptoms. Recurring common infections are frequent in both GOF and LOF mutations. = Loss of function = STAT1 loss of function, therefore STAT1 deficiency can have many variants. There are two main genetic impairments that can cause response to interferons type I and III. First there can be autosomal recessive partial or even complete deficiency of STAT1. That causes intracellular bacterial diseases or viral infections and impaired IFN a, b, g and IL27 responses are diagnosed. In partial form there can also be found high levels of IFNg in blood serum. When tested from whole blood, monocytes do not respond to BCG and IFNg doses with IL-12 production. In complete recessive form there is a very low response to anti-viral and antimycotical medication. Second, partial STAT1 deficiency can also be an autosomal dominant mutation; phenotypically causing impaired IFNg responses and causing patients to suffer with selective intracellular bacterial diseases (MSMD) In knock-out mice prepared in the 90s, a low amount of CD4+ and CD25+ regulatory T-cells and almost no IFNa, b and g response was discovered, which lead to parasital, viral and bacterial infections. The very first reported case of STAT1 deficiency in human was an autosomal dominant mutation and patients were showing propensity to mycobacterial infections. Another case reported was about an autosomal recessive form. 2 related patients had a homozygous missense STAT1 mutation which caused impaired splicing, therefore a defect in mature protein. Patients had partially damaged response to both IFNa and IFNg. Scientists now claim that recessive STAT1 deficiency is a new form of primary immunodeficiency and whenever a patient suffers sudden, severe and unexpected bacterial and viral infections, should be considered as potentially STAT1 deficient = Gain of function = Gain of function mutation was first discovered in patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). This disease is characteristic with its symptoms as persistent infections of the skin, mucosae - oral or genital and nails infections caused by Candida, mostly Candida albicans. CMC may very often result from primary immunodeficiency. Patients with CMC often suffer also with bacterial infections (mostly Staphylococcus aureus), also with infections of the respiratory system and skin. In these patients we can also find viral infections caused mostly by Herpesviridae, that also affect the skin. The mycobacterial infections are often caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or environmental bacteria. Very common are also autoimmune symptoms like type 1 diabetes, cytopenia, regression of the thymus or systemic lupus erythematosus. When T-cell deficient, these autoimmune d√≠seases are very common. CMC was also reported as a common symptom in patients with hyper immunoglobulin E syndrome (hyper-IgE) and with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I. There was reported an interleukin 17A role, because of low levels of IL-17A producing T-cells in CMC patients. With various genomic and genetic methods was discovered, that a heterozygous gain of function mutation of STAT1 is a cause of more than a half CMC cases. This mutation is caused by defect in the coiled-coil domain, domain that binds DNA, N-terminal domain or SH2 domain. Because of this there is increased phosphorylation because of impossible dephosphorylation in nucleus. These processes are dependent on cytokines like interferon alpha or beta, interferon gamma or interleukin 27. As mentioned above, low levels of interleukin 17A were observed, therefore impaired the Th17 polarization of the immune response. Patients with STAT1 gain of function mutation and CMC poorly or not at all respond to treatment with azole drugs such as Fluconazole, Itraconazole or Posaconazole. Besides common viral and bacterial infections, these patients develop autoimmunities or even carcinomas. It is very complicated to find a treatment because of various symptoms and resistancies, inhibitors of JAK/STAT pathway such as Ruxolitinib are being tested and are a possible choice of treatment for these patients  Interactions  STAT1 has been shown to interact with: * BRCA1, * C-jun, * CD117, * CREB-binding protein, * Calcitriol receptor, * Epidermal growth factor receptor, * Fanconi anemia, complementation group C, * GNB2L1, * IFNAR2, * IRF1, * ISGF3G * Interleukin 27 receptor, alpha subunit, * MCM5, * Mammalian target of rapamycin, * PIAS1, * PRKCD, * PTK2, * Protein kinase R, * STAT2, * STAT3, * Src, and * TRADD.

In particular The Locomotive Act 1865, also known as Red Flag Act, stated: : Firstly, at least three persons shall be employed to drive or conduct such locomotive, and if more than two waggons or carriages he attached thereto, an additional person shall be employed, who shall take charge of such waggons or carriages; : Secondly, one of such persons, while any locomotive is in motion, shall precede such locomotive on foot by not less than sixty yards, and shall carry a red flag constantly displayed, and shall warn the riders and drivers of horses of the approach of such locomotives, and shall signal the driver thereof when it shall be necessary to stop, and shall assist horses, and carriages drawn by horses, passing the same, The Red Flag Law was repealed in 1896, by which time the internal combustion engine was well into its infancy.Olyslager, 7 & 23  Red flag laws in the United States  In the United States, the state of Vermont passed a similar Red Flag Law in 1894, only to repeal it two years later. The most infamous of the Red Flag Laws was proposed in Pennsylvania circa 1896, when legislators unanimously passed a bill through both houses of the state legislature, which would require all motorists piloting their \\"horseless carriages\\", upon chance encounters with cattle or livestock to (1) immediately stop the vehicle, (2) \\"immediately and as rapidly as possible ... disassemble the automobile\\", and (3) \\"conceal the various components out of sight, behind nearby bushes\\" until equestrian or livestock is sufficiently pacified. The law never took effect, due to a veto by the state‚Äôs governor, Daniel H. Hastings. ReferencesBibliography * Bailey, T., and Kennedy, D. The American Pageant. Lexington: D. C.

WCKT airs a country music format branded as \\"Cat Country\\". WCKT originally signed on in 1976,airing a beautiful music format. In 1979, the format was flipped to Disco, and the call letters were changed to WSWF. In 1985, the format was changed to Album Oriented Rock, and the call letters were changed to WOOJ (Orange Rock 107). In 1988, facing competition from the new and much more powerful WRXK, WOOJ tweaked its format to Classic Rock. The format was flipped to Country as WCKT, in 1989. In only one ratings period, the new Cat Country beat longtime Southwest Florida country outlet WHEW to become the area's #1 country station. WCKT programmed a music intensive format up against WHEW's more full service approach. That lasted for several years until WHEW become WWGR (Gator Country) about the time the Ft. Myers and Naples markets were combined to become one metro. Since then, WWGR has been the #1 country outlet in the Ft. Myers - Naples market. During WCKT's history, current owner iHeartMedia, Inc. (formerly Clear Channel Communications) moved the station onto the 100.1 frequency out of Port Charlotte. Even though the 100.1 frequency is a C1 stronger signal, the northern leaning coverage area didn't put a strong enough signal to fully cover the Naples/Marco Island portion of the metro. Cat Country was moved back to 107.1 to compete with WWGR, and presumably also to substantially reduce overlap with co-owned WIKX, whose transmitter is in the same county as 100.1's and thus may have stolen audience from what is now WZJZ and vice versa.

Background Kuehne & Nagel was storing a transformer owned by London Drugs valued at $32,000. The agreement between the parties included a limitation of liability clause which limited liability for damage to the transformer to $40. Two employees were moving the transformer with a forklift and negligently dropped it.At paras 155-57. London Drugs sued the two employees on the basis that they owed a separate duty of care and could not seek protection under the contract. The courts below London Drugs succeeded at first instance at the British Columbia Supreme Court,(1986), 2 BCLR (2d) 181 (Sup Ct), [1986] 4 WWR 183 where the trial judge found the employees personally liable for the full amount of the damages, limiting the company's liability to $40. That judgment was reversed in part on appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal,(1990), 45 BCLR (2d) 1 (CA), 70 DLR (4th) 51, [1990] 4 WWR 289, 2 CCLT (2d) 161, 31 CCEL 67 where, in a majority decision, the employees' liability was reduced to $40. London Drugs appealed this decision and the respondent employees cross‚Äëappealed, arguing that they should be completely free of liability. At the Supreme Court of Canada The appeal was dismissed in a 6‚Äì0 ruling, while the cross-appeal was dismissed 5‚Äì1. The majority opinion Iacobucci J, writing for the majority, observed: While the employees were liable in negligence, they were able to gain protection under the contract. Employees are able to gain protection where: :# the limitation of liability clause must, either expressly or impliedly, extend its benefit to the employee(s) seeking to rely on it; and :# the employee(s) seeking the benefit of the limitation of liability clause must have been acting in the course of their employment and must have been performing the very services provided for in the contract between their employer and the plaintiff when the loss occurred.At para 257. Concurrence by McLachlin McLachlin J concurred, but for different reasons. Tort and contract constitute separate legal regimes, and the appellant's action against the employees in this case is necessarily in tort, since there was no contract between them. The theory of voluntary assumption of the risk permits an employee sued in tort to rely on a term of limitation in his employer's contract. The plaintiff, having agreed to the limitation of liability vis √† vis the employer, must be taken to have done so with respect to the employer's employees. Concurrence/dissent by La Forest La Forest J, in dissent, believed the respondent employees did not owe any duty of care to the appellant in the circumstances of this case. He applied the \\"Anns test\\" as formulated by the House of Lords, which asks: :* Is there a sufficient relationship of proximity, such that carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to the latter (in which case, a prima facie duty of care arises)? :* If so, are there any considerations which ought to reduce or limit ::* the scope of the duty, ::* the class of person to whom it is owed, or ::* the damages to which a breach of it may give rise? In the present case, the first question is answered in the affirmative. As to the second, he felt that the vicarious liability regime is best seen as a response to a number of policy concerns: :* It is not merely a mechanism by which the employer guarantees the employee's primary liability, but has the broader function of transferring to the enterprise itself the risks created by the activity performed by its agents. :* Elimination of the possibility of the employee bearing the loss is not only logically compatible with the vicarious liability regime, it is practically compelled by the developing logic of that regime. :* The employer will almost always be insured against the risk of being held liable to third parties by reason of his vicarious liability. Therefore, its cost is thus internalized to the profitable activity that gives rise to it. :* There is no requirement for double insurance, covering both the employee and his employer against the same risk. :* Further, imposing tort liability on the employee in these circumstances cannot be justified by the need to deter careless behaviour. An employee subjects himself to discipline or dismissal by a refusal to perform work as instructed by the employer, and the employer is free to establish contractual schemes of contribution from negligent employees. :* Finally, the elimination of employee liability will have no impact on the plaintiff's compensation in the vast majority of cases. The employee remains liable to the plaintiff for his independent torts. An independent tort may fall within or outside the range of the employer's liability under the vicarious liability regime. In that regard, the following questions must be answered: :* Is the tort alleged against the employee an independent tort or a tort related to a contract between the employer and the plaintiff? In answering this question, it is legitimate to consider the scope of the contract, the nature of the employee's conduct and the nature of the plaintiff's interest. :* If the alleged tort is independent, the employee is liable to the plaintiff if the elements of the tort action are proved. The liability of the company to the plaintiff is determined under the ordinary rules applicable to cases of vicarious liability. :* If the tort is related to the contract, the next question to be resolved is whether any reliance by the plaintiff on the employee was reasonable. The question here is whether the plaintiff reasonably relied on the eventual legal responsibility of the defendants under the circumstances.At para 151. Since the conduct of the employees was covered by the contract, the plaintiffs were considered to have voluntarily assumed the risk of their tortious behaviour. The plaintiffs could not have reasonably relied on the employees and, thus, the employees were shielded from liability.At paras 146‚Äì47, 152. Aftermath There has been much discussion about the nature of the ruling in two areas: :* the duty of care by employees to other parties, and :* vicarious liability The majority ruling, which shielded the employees' liability by virtue of contractual terms, has invited discussion as to the effect where such shielding is not in place. La Forest J's discussion of vicarious liability has influenced subsequent Supreme Court decisions on that doctrine, most notably Bazley v Curry,[1999] 2 SCR 534 at paras 14, 28, 31. which has had significant influence in the jurisprudence of other Commonwealth jurisdictions including the UK House of Lords in its ruling in .

However, drug runners have chosen to attack the school and Sam must band together the trouble makers and misfits in detention to defeat the criminals and stay alive. Plot Hamilton High School is no place for a teacher who cares. Teacher Sam Decker (Dolph Lundgren), a former soldier, doesn't care anymore. He's quitting. After military service in the Gulf War and the former Yugoslavia, he returned to his inner city neighborhood to teach at the toughest school in town. He wanted to make a difference‚Äîbut nothing does at Hamilton High. Frustrated and angered by a system that doesn't work, Sam hands in his resignation. But the day he does, he pulls one last detention duty with the toughest kids in the school. It's a bad day for all. But Hamilton High is about to become an all too real battleground when a well-organized group of killers armed with automatic weapons and explosives invade the supposedly deserted school after hours, using the school to hide $300 million worth of heroin they've hijacked. The plan is to use the school auto shop to prep two police cars, stash the drugs in secret compartments, and drive away safely. Led by the brilliant and sadistic Chester Lamb (Alex Karzis), the invaders are surprised to discover that Sam and the kids from the detention room are still inside the school. The hunt is on as Lamb's henchmen ruthlessly stalk the teacher and students through the school's halls and classrooms, while Lamb tracks them on the surveillance cameras, turning the school's security system against his prey. Sam and the kids band together and manage to combat the armed thugs and foil Lamb's perfectly planned crime. Along the way, they discover a sinister conspiracy that reaches to the police department and even the highest level of government. Paid-off local police and school security guards were supposed to make sure the school was empty after hours. But nobody figured Sam and his juvenile delinquents into the equation. Lamb and his crew‚Äîwho include Gloria Waylon (Kata Dob√≥), punkers Viktor (Joseph Scoren) and Alek (Anthony J. Mifsud) -- continue to stalk the students through the school. But Sam still has a few tricks to teach the kids, and he's got some things to learn from them. Tonight at Hamilton High, the lesson is survival.

It was released in China on November 18, 2016, in 2D, 3D and China Film Giant Screen 3D, and on video on demand in the United States on May 5. Plot Jack Bronson (Uriah Shelton) is a teenager who spends his free time playing warrior video games and working at a Chinese curios and antiques shop. His mother is trying to sell the house they live in before it goes into foreclosure. When Jack goes to a biking park, Travis (Dakota Daulby), a neighbourhood bully and his friends chase after him and he hides inside his bosses shop and helps out. A family heirloom, The Warriors Gate, from Mr Cheng‚Äôs cousin in Beijing arrives at the shop and he gives it to Jack as a gift. Jack goes to sleep with the thing in his room and wakes up with a sword at his neck. A warrior, Zhao (Mark Chao) tells him that the ‚ÄòBlack Knight‚Äô has to look after the most precious thing in the kingdom; the Princess. Jack gets to know Princess Su Lin and she stays with him overnight. The next morning, barbarians from the game realm come to kill the Princess but she fights them off, destroying the house in the process. The barbarians take the Princess back into the other realm through the Warriors Gate but when Jack goes in after her he arrives somewhere else. The Warrior who sent the Princess to stay with Jack is there and there is an army of barbarians trying to kill them. The Wizard stops time and the army is frozen. The Wizard tells Jack that Zhao was one of six children raised from both to protect the Emperor and that the only person who could defeat them was Arun the Cruel, King of the barbarians. Arun poisoned the warriors and killed the Emperor and the only people left alive were Su Lin and Zhao. The wizard searched through his seeing stone to find the greatest Warrior to protect the Princess and found The Black Knight; Jack's in game avatar; a ferocious and clever Warrior. Jack and Zhao find out that Arun the Cruel will marry the Princess, become Emperor and then have her killed; so their mission is to save her. While on their way through the \\"Unknown Kingdom\\" Jack tries the get Zhao to dance and have fun. In the forest, Jack gets held captive by beautiful Witch triplets that intend to eat him but Zhao saves him. At night Zhao starts to teach Jack how to fight. They get to a lake and Zhao says the trek around it will take days because he cannot swim. Jack agrees to teach him if Zhao continues teaching him how to fight like a Warrior. When they arrive at Arun's kingdom they get captured; their way of getting into the kingdom and past all the guards and knights. They get free by working together to kill the guard when he gives them their food. Jack saves Su Lin but just as they're about to kiss Zhao barges in and interrupts them. On their way out they get recaptured and put back in their cell, Jack tells Zhao that he‚Äôs too young to die, having never even kissed a girl. Zhao reveals that neither has he. A butterfly appears and Zhao has a conversation with it. Jack asks if the butterfly understood him and Zhao replies that he hopes so. During the wedding when Arun the Cruel lifts up her veil and goes to kiss Su Lin he sees that her face is of that of an insectoid monster with a long tongue and huge eyes. The Wizard uses his magic to distract everyone and frees Jack and Zhao just before hanging. The Wizard pours magic powder on Jacks shoes and tells him to jump. Jack saves the princess and all the barbarians try to kill them. The wizard gives Jack bags of magic powder to throw at them. One of the bags makes one of the barbarians a huge monster, however; too large for Jack and a formidable foe for Zhao. Eventually, Jack and Su Lin catapult themselves faraway and Zhao and the Wizard get away as well. Jack wakes up in a forest alone and after a search finds Su Lin tied up. Arun's guards attack Jack but he fights them off. Arun and Jack fight until Jack kills Arun and saves the Princess. Su Lin is crowned Empress and sometime afterwards they kiss and she tells Jack that she never thought he was worthless; not even when they first met. The Empress's guards see her lipstick on Jack‚Äôs face and try to kill him for touching her; but he gets home through the Warriors Gate; smashing it to pieces and rendering it useless to get back. When he goes to school the next day Jack finally defeats his bully, Travis. At home, Jack tries to put the Warriors Gate back together but fails so he creates a video game called ‚ÄòThe Warriors Gate‚Äô and sells it for $25,000 so that he and his mom get to keep their house. Days later Jack is at the mall for some ice-cream and bumps into Su Lin. She had the Wizard make her another box/gate and made a new law that everyone gets holidays; even the Empress. Back in Empress's Kingdom, we see Zhao teaching all the knights to dance. Su Lin also dances a modern dance while standing on the balcony of her Forbidden City- like palace.

Water moat and stone wall of Kagoshima Castle History This castle was constructed by Matsudaira Iehisa in 1601. In 1600 Shimazu Yoshihiro, the father of Iehisa, was defeated at the Battle of Sekigahara as a daimy≈ç of the western alliance, by the eastern alliance led by Tokugawa Ieyasu. This castle was built after the defeat and in the severe political tension with Ieyasu. This castle is notable for the small scale and fairly poor quality as a main castle of one of the richest daimy≈çs in Japan.

It is in the southern extreme of continental Chile very close to Cape Froward, surrounded by historic places such as Fort Bulnes and Puerto del Hambre (Port Famine). From the summit it is possible to see the Strait of Magellan, Dawson and Tierra del Fuego islands, and many other smaller ones; the Darwin Mountain Range, Mount Sarmiento, and most of the Brunswick Peninsula. Toponymy According to historian Mateo Martinic Beros in his book Cartograf√≠a Magall√°nica 1523-1945, the mount was named after the British surgeon, John Tarn, who first ascended the mountain in February 1827 while traveling with Robert FitzRoy on HMS Adventure and later ascended it while traveling with Phillip Parker King in HMS Beagle), during their surveying voyage from 1826 to 1830. Tarn participated in a hydrographic survey conducted in the area, through the collection and classification of flora and fauna species. Darwin's ascent On 6 February 1834 a group from the second Beagle survey expedition, including Charles Darwin, ascended Mount Tarn by forcing their way up through dense woodland to the bare ridge which took them to the summit. He recounted the story in his Journal and Remarks. In his ascent the young naturalist found the first ammonites ever known in South America.

It was designed in 1934 by Ing Felice Trojani, who at that time was collaborating with Umberto Nobile on the Arctic flights of the airships Norge and Italia. The aircraft's designation came from initials of the manufacturer, the surname of the designer, and the aircraft's wing area (18 m¬≤), the sole prototype receiving the serial no. M.M.363. Design & Development Born from the same Regia Aeronautica requirement that spawned the Caproni-Vizzola F.5, FIAT G.50, Macchi C.200, Meridionali Ro 51 and Reggiane Re 2000 fighters, the A.U.T.18 flew for the first time on 22 April 1939, powered by a Fiat A.80 R.C.41 radial engine. The fighter had an all-metal stressed-skin structure, covered in duralumin, featuring an inwardly-retracting undercarriage and retractable tail-wheel and was armed with two Breda-SAFAT machine-guns mounted in the wings just outboard of the undercarriage. Flight trials proved disappointing and lagged behind the other fighters in Progetto R - the modernisation (riammodernamento) of the Regia Aeronautica. With no production orders forthcoming, despite the prototype being returned to the Umbra factory at Foligno for modifications on 20 February 1940 and a second flight test series from 5 November 1940, no improvement was demonstrated over fighters already in production so the A.U.T.18 was abandoned. Operational history After delivery to the Regia Aeronautica on 5 November 1940 the fate of the prototype is not known, possibly being transferred to Germany for evaluation, it was also rumoured to have been captured by British forces, but it is more likely that it was destroyed in a raid after its transfer to Orvieto.

He played professionally in the American Soccer League, United Soccer League, American Indoor Soccer Association, Major Indoor Soccer League and Western Soccer Alliance. Early career A native of Key West, Florida, Gabarra attended Connecticut College where he played soccer from 1978 to 1981. In 1989, Connecticut College inducted Gabarra into its Athletic Hall of Fame. After finishing college in the spring of 1982, Gabarra was signed by the Detroit Express of the American Soccer League (ASL). The Express won the ASL championship that season, defeating the Oklahoma City Slickers two games to one to take the title. However, both the Express and the ASL barely made it through the 1983 season before they both folded. Gabarra spent most of his time with the Express on the substitute's bench. In 1984, the United Soccer League (USL) attempted to replace the ASL as the de facto U.S. second division. Gabarra moved to the USL where he joined the New York Nationals. The USL fared little better than the ASL, and the Nationals folded at the end of the season. The league itself collapsed during its second season, but by that time Gabarra was establishing himself as an indoor star. Indoor soccer In 1984, the Louisville Thunder of the newly established American Indoor Soccer Association (AISA) signed Gabarra. With the move to indoor soccer, Gabarra found his niche. That year he led the Thunder in scoring as the team went to the AISA championship series, only to lose to the Canton Invaders. On September 18, 1985, during the AISA off season, Gabarra signed with the Dallas Sidekicks of Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) as a free agent. He played ten games with the team, assisting on one goal, before moving back to the Louisville Thunder. In 1986, Gabarra and the Thunder finally overcame the Invaders and took the 1985‚Äì1986 AISA title. The next season, he moved to the Los Angeles Lazers of MISL. He stayed with the Lazers for three seasons. However, the team folded at the end of the 1988‚Äì1989 season. Gabarra then moved to the San Diego Sockers where he was a part of the 1990‚Äì1991 championship team. He moved once more, this time to the Tacoma Stars for the 1991‚Äì1992 season. By the 1991‚Äì1992 season, the MISL was on its last legs. At the end of the season, the league and the Stars folded. He then moved to the Milwaukee Wave of the National Professional Soccer League. During that time, Gabarra also played two outdoor seasons with the Los Angeles Heat. In 1989, the Heat were members of the Western Soccer League (WSL). That year, they lost in penalty kicks to the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks in the semi-finals. At the end of the 1989 season, the WSL merged with the American Soccer League to form the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). The Heat continued its excellent play in 1990, making it to the Western Conference championship series, where it fell again to the Blackhawks. Olympics, futsal and national team In 1986, Gabarra began playing for the U.S. Olympic soccer team as it began the qualification process for the 1988 Summer Olympics to be held in Seoul, South Korea. The U.S. qualified, and Gabarra was part of the team which went 1‚Äì1‚Äì1 and failed to reach the second round. Gabarra used his extensive indoor soccer experience to contribute to the U.S. Futsal team. He was the captain of the team from 1986 to 1996, during which he earned 30 indoor caps and scored 17 goals, both U.S. records. In 1989, the U.S. Futsal FIFA Futsal World Championship. Three years later, Gabarra and his teammates took second at the Futsal championship, losing 4‚Äì1 to Brazil in the championship game.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/timsheldon.geo/milestones.html%23Silver&date;=2009-10-25+23:06:49 Gabarra earned his first cap with the U.S. national team in a May 14, 1988 loss to Colombia. He went on to earn a total of 14 caps in 1988 and 1989. During 1989, he usually came on as a substitute. His last match with the national team came on November 5, 1989 in a scoreless tie with El Salvador. Coaching Gabarra began his transition from playing to coaching early in his career when he became the player/coach of the Louisville Thunder in 1985. He lasted two seasons as the head coach. After he retired from playing with the collapse of the Tacoma Stars and the MISL, he returned to coaching with the Milwaukee Wave. He lasted only the 1992‚Äì1993 season. In 1994, he became the head coach of the Washington Warthogs of the Continental Indoor Soccer League (CISL) and remained with the team through the 1997 season when the league folded. He also served as a volunteer assistant coach to his wife who is the women's soccer coach at the U.S. Naval Academy. On August 11, 2000, the Washington Freedom of the Women's United Soccer Association announced it had hired Gabarra as its first head coach. The WUSA was a new league which did not begin competitive play until the 2001 season. That year the Freedom stumbled badly, finishing second to the bottom in the standings and placing no players on the All Star team. In 2002, the Freedom made a complete turnaround and reached the WUSA championship, only to fall 3‚Äì2 to the Carolina Courage. In 2003, Gabarra led the Freedom to a second consecutive WUSA championship game. This time it won, defeating the Atlanta Beat 2‚Äì1 in overtime.http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=nytimes&page;=soc- wusa/news/ALN2754590.htm That was the last year for the WUSA, as it folded due to financial difficulties. When the WUSA folded, the Freedom recreated itself as an independent soccer club, the Freedom Soccer Club. Gabarra remained on as its head coach despite briefly coaching the San Diego Spirit during a tournament in 2004. In 2007, Gabarra coached the Freedom's W-League franchise to the W-League championship and was one of three finalists for W-League Coach of the Year. When the Freedom returned to professional soccer in 2009 as part of the new Women's Professional Soccer league, Gabarra continued as head coach. The team made the playoffs both that year and in 2010; however, the team suffered a 10-game winless streak in the latter. After losing the first- round playoff game (as happened in 2009 as well), Gabarra resigned, citing \\"irreconcilable differences\\" with team management. Gabarra signed with Sky Blue FC in 2011. After the WPS folded, Gabarra coached the New Jersey Wildcats of the W-League for the 2012 season. Gabarra returned to coach Sky Blue FC in 2013 as part of the National Women's Soccer League, where he led the team to the playoffs in their first year in the new league but did not return under his tenure. He left in October 2015 to become the general manager and head coach of the Washington Spirit In his first year in those roles with the Spirit, the team hosted a home playoff match, won a playoff game, and advanced to the NWSL Championship for the first times in club history. The Spirit drew the Western New York Flash in regulation and extra periods before losing 4-3 in penalty kicks.

Sombat Metanee's son, Siricoup Metanee, also stars as a young police lieutenant, newly arrived at a rough-and-tumble post in a Thai-Myanmar border town on the Salween River. The screenplay is co-written by Chatrichalerm and Stirling Silliphant. Plot A text scroll at the opening of the film gives some historical background about Myanmar (or Burma) being granted independence after World War II by the United Kingdom, without the problem of ethnic conflict with the Karen people on the country's border areas being resolved. So since then, the Burmese central government, then known as SLORC and the Karen National Liberation Army have been engaged in a war that is little known to outside people. A Thai timber baron, Tweepong, exploits the situation by courting both the KNLA and SLORC in order to have the unrest continue while his company logs the teak forests in the border region of the Salween River. Into this volatile, \\"wild west\\" atmosphere comes a young, idealistic police lieutenant, Danai, who's to take charge of the police station at the border town of Fah Soong Pha Sak. He rides into town on his motorcycle as a gun battle has erupted between the police, led by tough Sergeant Ram, against some gun thugs. Danai, wearing his crisp police uniform, ends up dumped in a pig pen, covered in mud. He then gives the unkempt, undisciplined local policemen a dressing down, saying they all must clean up and wear their uniforms. The gunmen who started the fight had been sent to kill Ram by Somsak Tweepong, son of the local \\"godfather\\". Somsak later visits Danai to invite him to his father's birthday party. Eager to carry out his duties, Danai starts a foot patrol of his mountainous district and finds that his tight brown uniform and new boots are unsuited to the rugged terrain. While sitting down to rest and care for some blisters on his feet, he encounters a man nattily dressed in white clothes chasing butterflies with a net. The man is the elder Tweepong, who gives Danai some salve. After Danai leaves, Tweepong meets with a SLORC colonel and gains intelligence about the Myanmar government's fight against the Karen. Danai attends the birthday party for Tweepong, and meets Somsak's wife, who was a former beauty queen and actress from Bangkok. She is unhappily married to Somsak and has become an alcoholic. Danai continues his tour of the district, meeting Nid, who is a teacher at a school for Thai hill-tribe children. She is also the daughter of Sergeant Ram. Her mother was a Karen woman, who was raped and killed by Somsak Tweepong's men, hence the deep resentment Ram has against Tweepong. Further education comes for Danai when fighting between the KNLA and the SLORC spills over into Thailand. As Karen troops, led by KNLA Lieutenant Tulay, are being attacked by a SLORC helicopter, they attempt to wade the Salween River and cross over into Thailand. Danai at first orders Ram to turn the Karen back, but after seeing the helicopter gunship decimate the Karen, he relents, even growing so frustrated as to fire upon the helicopter, which then fires back. However, nothing more comes of this incident. But there is more drama in store, as Somsak discovers his wife having an affair. She accuses Somsak of being a homosexual, and Somsak grows enraged. His wife pulls out a gun, and Somsak tries to take it from her, shooting her in the process. She escapes and drives to the police station, where she dies after saying Somsak had shot her. Somsak is now a fugitive, hiding in Myanmar. Danai at first believes he must go through proper channels to extradite Somsak, but Ram convinces him otherwise, and they take a party into Myanmar to get Somsak back by force. Somsak's father makes a deal with the KNLA to give them Stinger missiles in exchange for saving his son. Tulay and his men sneak up on Danai's party at night, but let them live in exchange for saving their lives during the earlier incident at the river. Danai tells Tulay that Somsak had committed murder and must be brought back to Thailand for trial. \\"This is Kawthoolei. Thai laws have no meaning here,\\" Tulay replies. The next morning, the Karen attack. Ram is fatally shot, but he is able to get off a shot that injures Tulay. Danai and the survivors, including Ram's daughter, take Somsak and head back to Thailand. Just as Danai and Nid are crossing a small river bridge back to Thailand, they come under attack again by Tulay, who, though injured, was waiting under the water just upstream to ambush them. However, then SLORC troops show up and shoot Tulay. The SLORC colonel says he has made a deal with Tweepong for Somsak, and orders Danai to drop his weapons. Tulay, though, is not yet dead. He floats downstream under the bridge and fatally shoots the colonel. Somsak then runs back towards Myanmar, but Nid still has her pistol. She hands it to Danai, who then shoots Somsak in the back to death.

Gunman series Salween was also entitled Gunman 2 (, or Mue puen 2) as a followup to Chatrichalerm's 1983 film, Gunman. However, aside from the presence of Sorapong Chatree, who starred in the earlier film, as well as Ron Rittichai, the stories and characters of the two films have no relation, so Salween is a sequel to Gunman in name only.

It is a suburban subdivision, consisting mostly of low-density, single detached dwellings. As of 2009, the area is home to 3,445 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a middle- income area, with an average family income of $78,438, an average dwelling value of $287,976 and a home ownership rate of 90.3%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $350,096. History Saskatoon Full Gospel Church, formerly Churchill School The most of the land for the Adelaide/Churchill neighbourhood was annexed by the city between 1910 and 1919, with the remaining southern piece annexed between 1960 and 1969. According to a 1913 map of registered subdivisions, the area was divided in two: Victoria Park to the north of Ruth Street and Park Adelaide to the south. The two were developed as Churchill (north) and Adelaide Park (south) - with Ruth Street as the dividing line - but were combined into a single neighbourhood when the city redrew its neighbourhood boundaries in the 1990s. The layout of the streets reflects the urban planning philosophies of the day when the land was developed. The north part of the neighbourhood, developed just after World War II, follows a traditional grid pattern. By the 1950s, the design of residential neighbourhoods used a modern system of curving residential streets, feeding into collector roads that connected to arterial roads. Thus, the southern part of the neighbourhood follows this design practice. Churchill School was built in 1956, but served as a public school for just under thirty years before closing. Hugh Cairns V.C. School was opened in 1960. It was named after Hugh Cairns (VC), a Canadian soldier from World War I whose hometown was Saskatoon. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the British Commonwealth's highest award for bravery in battle. Coincidentally, the school is located on Cairns Avenue; however the street was actually named for local pioneer John Cairns, not the soldier. A divisive debate occurred in 2008 when the Saskatoon Full Gospel Church, owners of the former Churchill School, sought approval to demolish the structure and build a new church and attached condominium complex. Area residents complained that the new building would increase traffic on residential streets, and clash with the existing character of the neighbourhood. Ultimately, city council approved the project and it was under construction as of 2013. Build-out of the neighbourhood was mostly complete by the mid-1970s when work was completed on a series of residential crescents south of Wilson Cres., however some additional development in the late 1980s saw Calder Avenue in the neighborhood's southwest corner extended south of a back lane, with three cul- de-sac streets and a crescent that extended to Clarence Avenue. In addition, construction of an interchange at Clarence Avenue and Circle Drive, in the planning stages since the 1960s, was completed in the late 2000s, facilitating resident access to the freeway and to the major commercial development at Stonebridge. Cumberland Avenue, which forms the eastern boundary of the community, was originally planned to connect with Circle Drive, but ultimately the city chose not to do this, leaving Clarence the only street that directly connects to the freeway from Adelaide/Churchill. In 2017, construction began on a new fire station on Clarence Avenue South, just north of St. Martin's Church and Wilson Crescent. The station, which opened in 2018, replaced an older station in the Queen Elizabeth community to the northwest; it was relocated to Adelaide/Churchill in order to allow it to also serve Stonebridge to the south. Government and politics Adelaide/Churchill exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon‚ÄîGrasswood. It is currently represented by Kevin Waugh of the Conservative Party of Canada, first elected in 2015. Provincially, the area is mostly within the boundaries of Saskatoon Eastview. It is currently represented by Corey Tochor of the Saskatchewan Party, first elected in 2011. A small portion of the neighborhood north of Isabella Street is within the boundaries of Saskatoon Churchill-Wildwood. In Saskatoon's non- partisan municipal politics, Adelaide/Churchill lies within ward 7. It is currently represented by Councillor Mairin Loewen, who was elected to city council in a 2011 by-election. Institutions=Education *Churchill School was a public elementary school constructed in 1956 and closed in the early 1980s, before being sold to the Saskatoon Full Gospel Church on July 1, 1985. *Hugh Cairns V. C. School - public elementary, part of the Saskatoon Public School Division. The school was constructed in 1959 and took in its first students in 1960. Although located on Cairns Avenue, the school and the street are not named for the same person; the school is named for Saskatonian Hugh Cairns, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during World War I, while the street is named for Alderman John Cairns and was actually called 12th Avenue until 1954. *St. Philip School - separate (Catholic) elementary, part of Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools In addition, Aden Bowman Collegiate (a grade 9-12 high school) is located across the street from the neighbourhood's northwest corner, though many students living in Adelaide/Churchill attend the 9-12 high school Walter Murray Collegiate in Nutana Suburban Centre. The nearest Catholic/Separate high school is Holy Cross High School, located east of Walter Murray.

It is native to the southeastern United States. Description This is a slender minnow about 5 to 6.5 centimeters long. A lateral band and a paler stripe run from the gills to the tail fin. There is a rectangular spot on the caudal peduncle. The scales along the back are dark and the belly is white. The breeding male is red-orange in color.Tennessee Shiner. Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. 2008. Distribution The fish is distributed throughout several river basins in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.Notropis leuciodus. NatureServe. 2013. It occurs in much of the Tennessee River drainage, especially the upper tributaries, and the Cumberland and Green River drainages. It occurs in the Savannah and Kanawha River systems, where it may be an introduced species.NatureServe. 2013. Notropis leuciodus. In: IUCN 2013. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2013.1. Downloaded on 17 November 2013. Its non- native range is not clear, but there are several sites to which it was likely introduced when it was used for bait and released.Nico, L. and P. Fuller. Notropis leuciodus. USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database, Gainesville, Florida, USA. Revised 2010. Biology This freshwater fish lives in pools, creeks, and small to medium rivers. It prefers cool, clear waters over gravelly substrates.Froese, R. and D. Pauly. (Eds.) Notropis leuciodus. FishBase. 2011. In this habitat it is associated with some of its congeners, such as the telescope shiner (N. telescopus) and the bigeye shiner (N. boops). Breeding has been observed in late spring. Males in breeding colors aggregate in swarms in shallow pools and are briefly visited by females, which spawn and then depart. It may also spawn over the nests of other species, such as the river chub (Nocomis micropogon) and largescale stoneroller (Campostoma oligolepis). Conservation This is a widespread species with many populations which are likely stable or declining only slowly. There may be threats to local ecosystems, but the species faces no major threats and is not of high conservation concern.

After ABC had previously announced 22 episodes for the season, this 23rd episode was added for the debut season, due to the series' success. Plot As Betty returns from Mexico, having failed in her attempt to secure a visa for Ignacio, she attempts to call Henry. At first Betty starts hesitating, but goes through with it by summoning the accountant to the copying room. She begins to tell him that she is going to fight for him after realizing that when you find something good in life, you have to go after it. Henry tells her that he and Charlie have broken up, and says that he wants to be with her, to Betty's delight. They decide to have their first date together. As Betty is preparing dinner for her and Henry, Charlie shows up at Betty's house to reveal that she is pregnant. When Henry shows up, Betty tells him to talk to Charlie and the two leave. Betty waits distressed that night and following morning as none of her messages are returned. She finally hears back from Henry, who asks her to meet him. He tells Betty that he never had a father growing up and doesn't want to be absent from his child's life. He has decided to return to Tucson with Charlie, who wants to go back to her hometown and, after sharing their last kiss, says goodbye. Hours later at her orthodontist's office, Diane, a technician asks Betty how her date went. She tells her Charlie, his ex, is pregnant and they never had a chance to be together. Diane, who has a love for romantic comedies, asks more about this other woman who probably got pregnant on purpose. Betty tells her a little about Charlie and Diane comments Dr. Farkas has been dating a cute red-head named Charlie. Betty doesn't think she is the same girl until she notices Diane's bracelet, which Charlie gave as gifts to the staff. The ladies realize that Charlie and Betty's orthodontist, Dr. Gabe Farkas, had been dating for the past two months, adding a new twist as it is now unclear whether Charlie's unborn child is Henry's, as Charlie and Henry prepare to take off for their flight back to Arizona. Meanwhile, Wilhelmina makes great strides in her ambitious power play by manipulating Bradford into proposing to her, as Bradford gives her a wedding ring that he made himself. However, Wilhelmina's plans for a June wedding at St. Patrick's Cathedral has been road blocked by Fabia. It appears that she has booked it for her wedding, so she forces Wilhelmina into making an exchange: She'll give up the date for the services of \\"That Girl\\", who happens to be Marc. Wilhelmina agrees and Marc (or \\"Marco\\" as Fabia calls him) becomes Fabia's slave. However, the exchange is called off as Wilhelmina gets Marc back and moves up the wedding date to November. It appears that Daniel has descended further in a downward spiral due to his drug addiction. After he lies to Betty about how he got a black eye by claiming that he saved a girl scout in Central Park, Betty runs to Alexis and tells her about this heroic deed, prompting Alexis to intervene and to embarrass him because his \\"story\\" was twisted, since it happened when Alex was a teenager and was the one who saved the girl. So Alexis convinces Betty to have the Girl Scouts and the press to come by MODE for a photo opportunity, and as expected, Alexis embarrasses her brother. Afterwards, Daniel comes clean to Betty, who thinks that taking drugs to cure his sex problem is making matters worse. Later that evening as Daniel goes to see Bradford, he is upset over his dad's plans to divorce Claire and marry Wilhelmina, leading him to go off the deep end. Hours later he stops by Alexis' office to say that he is resigning and then rambles on about how he wish that they were a family again. Alexis then notices that Daniel has been taking pills and drinking heavily, but as Alexis and Daniel head for the hospital to detox Daniel after he overdoses, they take Bradford's car, not knowing that the brakes were cut by the guy Alexis hired to exterminate Bradford (Daniel overhears his sister mentions this), and the car crashes, leaving the siblings unconscious at the scene. At the institute, Claire, along with Yoga and two inmates, make plans to escape. They do so by feeding their diabetic inmate chocolate, causing the driver to stop. (Claire gets the driver to stop by saying the diabetic is having a hypoglycemic reaction‚Äîwhich would actually be cured by, not caused by, giving her chocolate.) When he goes to check on the girl, they choke him with their handcuffs while Claire grabs his gun and points it at him saying, \\"This is happening!\\" Claire and Yoga are later seen running down the road, still handcuffed, as Claire sets her sights on stopping Wilhelmina from marrying Bradford. Back at MODE, Christina sees Amanda and asks what she was doing in \\"The Closet.\\" Amanda says that she has found her favorite secret spot, then opens up the \\"Love Dungeon\\". This would prompt Amanda and Christina to argue at each other, only to have the two end up getting locked inside. While inside, Christina and Amanda drink over their differences, then reveal how they ended up at MODE, with Christina revealing that she was married to an insurance agent named Stuart, but then she walked away from her family in Scotland and no one has bothered to look for her since. Amanda then tells her that after her acting career went nowhere, her father, who was handling Fey's accounts, got her the \\"Lifetime Receptionist\\" job. As they look for more alcohol, Christina accidentally discovers a safe and opening it with the combination numbers (that matches Fey's measurements), then discover an envelope containing pictures of Amanda as a chubby child, thus stunning Amanda, who recognizes the photos after she sees them. Christina then finds a birth certificate that reveals Fey Sommers as Amanda's mother, stunning Amanda even more as she now knows why she got her job at MODE in the first place. After Justin 'accidentally' fed walnuts to his classmate who had the lead role, which caused him to have an allergic reaction and unable to perform, Justin moves from understudy to star. Betty has an idea to go and find Henry at the airport, with the intention to stop him from leaving, Before she can leave, several police officers arrive asking for Hilda Suarez. Hilda is already at the play, waiting next to an empty seat she saves for Santos, thinking he is standing up his family. Betty arrives at Justin's school to deliver some bad news to Hilda: Santos has been shot. Earlier that evening he was held hostage in a convenience store while on his way to see his son perform and shot while trying to defend the clerk. The season ends with Hilda crying out in devastation whilst the audience watch \\"West Side Story\\" in tears. Casting This is the last episode in which Judith Light (Claire Meade) and Christopher Gorham (Henry) were credited as also starring. From Season Two onwards they became full-time series regulars. Arap Bethke, who played Antonio in the previous episode, is credited, but does not appear, in this episode. Kristin Chenoweth and Ana Ortiz worked together before in Chenoweth's short lived sitcom, Kristin, but they did not appear on-screen together in this episode. Juliette Goglia, who appeared in this episode, would return as a recurring regular in the second season. Production The working title of this episode was \\"The Number 23\\", a double reference to the movie of the same name starring Jim Carrey and the fact that this is the 23rd episode. It also had the working titles The Conclusion of Betty's Life or Surprises are all Around! Other notes *Ang√©lica Vale, the star of La fea m√°s bella, the second Mexican version of Betty la fea, appears in this episode as a character who looks exactly like Lety, the character she played on the aforementioned show. *When Angelica walks away while Betty is at the dentist, Diane exclaims, \\"Back to your cage, Shrek!\\" The film Shrek the Third opened the day after this episode originally aired. *In the opening scene, upon greeting Betty's after her return from Mexico, Daniel says, \\"Hey, how is Dora the Explorer?\\" a reference to the popular children's program where the cartoon character travels the globe and teaches the audience Spanish. *In the scene where Wilhelmina is trying to get Fabia to change her wedding date, Fabia points at Marc saying, \\"I want That Girl!\\". Marc looks up with an open mouth, paying homage to the old ABC show's regular opening gag. In a season two episode, Marlo Thomas, (the original star of said series) did a guest spot as Sandra Winthrop. Music notes Vanessa L. Williams sang the rendition of \\"The Way We Were\\" that played during the montage of scenes featuring special moments between Wilhelmina and Marc. Williams performed this cover as the lead vocalist on Dave Koz's 2007 album, At The Movies. A video for the song can be found here. Ratings In the United States the episode was watched by 10.39 million viewers, but was second behind a CBS special honoring Bob Barker's retirement from television (14.33 million viewers). In other countries, the results were mixed. In the United Kingdom, the finale rated less than the premiere episode, attracting 3.1 million viewers with 15% share when it aired on Channel 4 on June 8, 2007. In Australia, it received the lowest rating of the year - 1.051 million, and only in the 13th slot of the night (August 5, 2007) during its airing on the Seven Network. This was predominantly because it aired in the same timeslot as the season premiere of a rival program on the Ten Network, Australian Idol. Promotion The Song \\"It's Not Over Yet\\" by Klaxons was used in the advertisement on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom.

Her chief speciality is sexuality in Judaism, and she says that her beliefs were transformed by a Sabbath prayer book (Siddur Nashim) that refers to God as 'She'. Early life and education Rebecca Alpert was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Sylvia and Irving Trachtenberg. She attended Erasmus Hall High School and Barnard College before getting her Ph.D. in religion at Temple University and her rabbinical training at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (RRC) in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association, 2008 Directory Her specialization is in American and especially Jewish American religious history, and she focuses on issues related to gender, sexuality and race. Her thinking about many of these issues was shaped by her teachers, who included Elaine Pagels and Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism. Career After completing her Ph.D. and receiving her rabbinic ordination, Alpert worked on a contractual basis with a number of synagogues in the U.S. and Canada. In this capacity she was among a handful of the first generation of congregational women rabbis. She came out as a lesbian in 1986. She divorced her husband Joel Alpert (with whom she has two children: Lynn and Avi) and became partners with Christie Balka. During this time she also taught courses in Holocaust Studies at Rutgers University, and she was the Dean of Students at the RRC until 1987. Thereafter she served in several capacities at Temple University: as Director of Adult Programs, Director of the Program in Women's Studies, and finally a faculty member in the departments of religion and women's studies. Alpert's research has focused on explaining and expounding the Reconstructionist tradition, the place of gays and lesbians in Jewish religious history, and the relationships between Jews, blacks, and sports during the years 1930‚Äì1950. Her book on that topic, Out of Left Field: Jews and Black Baseball, was published by Oxford University Press. She has also edited several volumes and published articles on a wide range of topics including sexuality in Judaism, the definition of who is Jewish and who is not, gay liberation theology, Alvin Dark, and Jackie Robinson. Her book Like Bread on the Seder Plate: Jewish Lesbians and the Transformation of Tradition from Columbia University Press received the 1998 Lambda Literary Award for best LGBT book on religion. She also wrote \\"Finding Our Past: A Lesbian Interpretation of the Book of Ruth,\\" which was included in Reading Ruth: Contemporary Women Reclaim a Sacred Story, edited by J. A. Kates and G.T. Reimer (1994). She has lectured at a number of colleges and universities, including Columbia, UPenn, Princeton and Swarthmore and is an active public intellectual who writes for mainstream publications and frequently speaks at rallies and on panels in the Philadelphia region and beyond. Alpert is a recipient of a Christian R. and Mary F. Lindback Distinguished Teaching Award. She has recently taught courses on religion in American public life, Jews, America and sports, and sexuality in world religions. Alpert is currently a Professor in the Departments of Religion and Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies at Temple University, and Senior Associate Dean of the College of Liberal Arts. She has mentored several graduate students, including Marie Dallam, author of Cowboy Christians and Brett Krutzsch, author of Dying to Be Normal: Gay Martyrs and the Transformation of American Sexual Politics, both from Oxford University Press. According to her faculty website: \\"In the past several years her research has focused on religion and sports. Out of Left Field: Jews and Black Baseball, was published by Oxford University Press in June 2011. Religion and Sports: An Introduction and Case Studies was published by Columbia University Press in May 2015.\\" An anthology, co-edited with Arthur Remillard, Gods, Games, and Globalization: New Perspectives on Religion and Sport was published by Mercer University Press in 2019. Israel Alongside Katherine Franke, a Columbia Law School professor, Alpert publicly canceled her scheduled appearance at the Equality Forum's 2012 Global LGBT Summit in Philadelphia to protest Israel's policies toward the Palestinians, accusing the organizers of the forum of becoming \\"cheerleaders for Israel.\\" Siddur Nashim She commented (Reform Judaism, Winter 1991): Siddur Nashim was published in 1976 by Naomi Janowitz and Margaret Wenig.

The Treaty of Doak's Stand (7 Stat. 210, also known as Treaty with the Choctaw) was signed on October 18, 1820 (proclaimed on January 8, 1821) between the United States and the Choctaw Indian tribe. Based on the terms of the accord, the Choctaw agreed to give up approximately one-half of their remaining Choctaw homeland. In October 1820, Andrew Jackson and Thomas Hinds were sent as commissioners who represented the United States to negotiate a treaty to surrender a large portion of Choctaw country in Mississippi. They met with tribal representatives at Doak's Stand on the Natchez Trace. They met with the chiefs Pushmataha, Mushulatubbee, and Apuckshunubbee, who represented the three major regional divisions of the Choctaw. Chiefs of the towns and other prominent men accompanied them, such as Colonel Silas Dinsmoor. Dinsmore was a former US Indian agent to the Choctaw; his passport ruling in 1812 had stirred a brief controversy with General Andrew Jackson. Dinsmore was at the negotiations to settle a land claim; he believed the policy of the American government toward the Indian tribes was too harsh. His attitude suggested a potential confrontation, but Jackson paid no attention to him. The convention began on October 10 with a talk by Jackson (whom the Choctaw nicknamed Sharp Knife), to more than 500 Choctaw. After Jackson presented his proposal to exchange Choctaw land for territory in present-day Arkansas, Pushmataha accused the general of deceiving them about the quality of land west of the Mississippi. Pushmataha said, \\"I know the country well ... The grass is everywhere very short ... There are but few beavers, and the honey and fruit are rare things.\\" Jackson finally resorted to threats to pressure the Choctaw to sign a treaty. He shouted, \\"Many of your nation are already beyond the Mississippi, and others are every year removing .... If you refuse ... the nation will be destroyed.\\" On October 18, 1820, the chiefs signed the treaty. Article IV prepared the Choctaw to become citizens of the United States when he or she became acculturated. This article would later influence Article XIV in the 1830 Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. Terms Pushmataha in 1824, from History of the Indian Tribes of North America. The preamble begins, The terms of the treaty were: 1\\\\. Choctaw land (in Mississippi) ceded to the U.S. 2\\\\. Boundary of western land (in Arkansas) ceded to the Choctaw nation. 3\\\\. Marking of boundaries by Choctaw-appointed guide. 4\\\\. Boundaries may not change until the Choctaw are civilized and enlightened so as to become citizens of the United States. 5\\\\. Corn, Blankets, kettles, rifle guns, bullet moulds & nippers, and ammunition to be given to Choctaws, who moved from ceded territory to lands west of the Mississippi River (Oklahoma), for one year. 6\\\\. U.S. agent appointed, goods and supplies to be sent, and a blacksmith will be appointed to Choctaws in ceded lands. Property of removed Choctaws to be sent to them. 7\\\\. Selling of Choctaw lands to support Choctaw schools on both sides of the Mississippi River. 8\\\\. Annuity of $6000 US annually for 16 years for discontented Choctaws. Andrew Jackson in 1824.

To a large extent these controversies stem from the rapid increase and spread of the local churches in the United States in the 1960s and early 1970s. In the 1970s they became a target of opposition of fledgling countercult ministries. Unsupported criticisms of anti-social behaviors led to three libel litigations. In addition, some criticized the teaching of Witness Lee on the nature of God, God's full salvation, and the church. History=Interaction with countercult ministries By the 1960s the writings of Watchman Nee had become popular among evangelicals,... including many in Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC). In 1968 Campus Crusade's national field director Jon Braun, who had read Watchman Nee's ,. and all of the regional directors under him left Campus Crusade seeking the New Testament church.. A short time later Braun joined a group led by Gene Edwards, a former Southern Baptist evangelist. Edwards had met with the local churches briefly before leaving to carry out his own interpretation of what the church should be. In 1969 Campus Crusade launched what became Christian World Liberation Front (CWLF). at UC-Berkeley as an attempt to reach the young people in the counterculture... Jack Sparks, a former statistics professor at Penn State and Crusade staff member, soon became the dominant figure in CWLF... Throughout the early 1970s Sparks and Braun, who knew each other through CCC, gave talks at CWLF gatherings against Witness Lee and the local churches to stem the loss of members to the (local) church in Berkeley..... Braun, who had a bitter split with Gene Edwards and left his group, joined with Sparks and five other former Crusade leaders to establish the New Covenant Apostolic Order (NCAO) with themselves as apostles. In 1979 six of the original seven NCAO apostles appointed themselves bishops of the newly formed Evangelical Orthodox Church (EOC)..Peter Gillquist, Becoming Orthodox: A Journey to the Ancient Christian Faith, 3rd ed.

Wallerstedt followed Sparks but completed the manuscript he had been commissioned to write for SCP. Thus, both the NCAO and SCP had copies of Wallerstedt's manuscript.Deposition of Jack Sparks, The Church in Atlanta et al v. Thomas Nelson et al, November 16, 1981:318‚Äì19.Deposition of Jon Edward Braun, The Church in Dallas et al v. Thomas Nelson et al, December 19, 1981:610. In the summer of 1976 Peter Gillquist, the presiding NCAO apostle, became the head of the new books division at Thomas Nelson Publishers (Nelson), a respected Bible publisher. The first book Gillquist commissioned was The Mindbenders by Jack Sparks.Peter Gillquist, letter to Sam Moore (President of Thomas Nelson Publishers), April 30, 1976. Sparks was listed as the putative author but the chapter on the local churches was written by Braun, who, although he had never met with the local churches, blamed Watchman Nee and Witness Lee for his negative experience with Gene Edwards.Peter Gillquist, letter to Jack Sparks, August 13, 1976.Peter Gillquist, letter to Jack Sparks, August 25, 1976Deposition of Gordon Thomas Walker, The Church in Dallas et al v. Thomas Nelson, Inc., et al, February 3, 1981:45.Jack Sparks, The Mindbenders, 1st edition (Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson, 1977). Meanwhile, SCP was independently developing Wallerstedt's manuscript into a book titled The God-Men.Deposition of Brooks Loftin Alexander, Lee et al v. Duddy et al, August 6, 1982, 505. First editions of both The Mindbenders and The God-Men were published in 1977.Jack Sparks, The Mindbenders, 1st edition (Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson, 1977).Spiritual Counterfeits Project, The God-Men, 1st edition (Berkeley, CA: Spiritual Counterfeits Project, 1977). Responding to the strong demand for countercult publications after the Jonestown tragedy of November 1978, second editions of both books were published.Jack Sparks, The Mindbenders, 2nd ed (Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson, 1979).Neil Duddy & the SCP, The God-Men, 2nd ed (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1981). Before and after each edition of either book was published, members of the local churches wrote letters of protest to the authors and publishers and attempts were made to contact them both personally and by phone. Nelson alone received approximately three hundred responses.. InterVarsity Press, the publisher of the second edition of The God-Men, received a response including over five hundred pages of supporting documentation refuting the book's charges.‚ÄúAn Appeal to InterVarsity Concerning The God-Men‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Reply of the Local Churches to The God-Men,‚Äù both dated 1980. The Mindbenders and The God-Men accused the local churches not just of theological error but of sociological deviance, including practicing authoritarianism, thought reform, isolation of members, deceptive recruiting, use of fear and humiliation to control members, and financial malfeasance.Sparks, Mindbenders, 15‚Äì17, 224‚Äì32, 252‚Äì53.Neil T. Duddy & the SCP, The God-Men: An Inquiry into Witness Lee & the Local Church (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1981), 28, 39‚Äì40, 107‚Äì40. Following publication, members of the local churches became objects of harassment, physical assault, and attempted deprogrammings. In addition, members were dismissed from jobs and family relationships were damaged.. In China the Three-Self Patriotic Movement commissioned two men to write a book to provide justification for a nationwide persecution against the local churches.Jiang Ping, ‚ÄúReport on the Shouters: A Travelogue,‚Äù an official report to the United Front Work Department, January 1983.Overseas Missionary Fellowship, Pray for China Fellowship, December 1983.Chinese Church Research Center, China Prayer Letter 39. The authors relied on The God-Men and its accusations in their writing.‚ÄúSpeaking of the Shouters: An Interview with Tang Shou-lin and Ren Zhongxiang,‚Äù Bridge: Church Life in China Today 2, November 1983:16‚Äì18.. Over two thousand local church members were arrested, many were given extended sentences, and some were even executed.. Seeking relief from libel In 1980, after all attempts to communicate with the authors and publishers were rebuffed, groups of local churches and individual church members filed libel actions concerning The Mindbenders in four jurisdictions‚ÄîAnaheim, Dallas, Atlanta, and Cleveland. The lawsuits named Nelson, Sparks, Braun, Dick Ballew (an EOC bishop and close associate of Braun), and Gillquist as defendants. The discovery process was subsequently consolidated to expedite the cases. A separate libel action was filed by the Church in Anaheim, Witness Lee, and William T. Freeman against Neil Duddy, the principal author of The God-Men; Spiritual Counterfeits Project; and Schwengeler-Verlag, publisher of a German translation of the same Duddy manuscript which was the basis for the second edition of The God-Men. Although the local churches strongly protested that both The Mindbenders and The God-Men misrepresented their teachings, the issues raised in the lawsuits were not theological but were based on the books‚Äô false and defamatory accusations of sociological deviance.. Discovery in The Mindbenders case revealed that Gillquist had used his position within Nelson to push for publication of the book over objections from internal staff and outside reviewers of the pre-publication proofs.Larry Stone, memo to Sam Moore, September 10, 1976.Jim Powell, letter to Sam Moore, September 24, 1976.Deposition of Craig Lampe, Church in Dallas et al v. Thomas Nelson et al, October 28, 1981. After two years of discovery, the case was settled out of court. All defendants signed an agreement that stipulated financial recompense for damages and that Nelson issue a retraction to be published in major newspapers and Christian periodicals nationwide.. Early in The God-Men case Neil Duddy and SCP had a rancorous split stemming from Duddy's claims of SCP's financial mismanagement.Neil Duddy, letter to Michael Woodruff and David Brooks, July 15, 1982. Duddy moved to Denmark to avoid entanglement in The God-Men proceedings.Eugene Gruhler and Dan Towle, interview with Neil Duddy in Aarhus, Denmark, February 28, 1983. Depositions showed that Duddy failed to document his accusations against the local churches with credible evidence and that SCP, despite having misgivings about Duddy's research, had not fact- checked his work or sought independent verification. On the day the court was to schedule the trial, SCP's attorneys, in anticipation of a judgment against SCP, announced that their client had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.‚ÄúBankruptcy Halts Trial of Religious Group,‚Äù San Francisco Chronicle, March 5, 1985:1, 10, 17. Neither Duddy nor representatives of Schwengeler-Verlag made an appearance. The court granted the plaintiffs‚Äô petition for permission to present their evidence despite the SCP bankruptcy and the other defendants‚Äô default. The local churches retained six experts to testify on their behalf.. During the proceedings Judge Leon Seyranian questioned the witnesses and experts in the absence of defense counsel. At the end of those proceedings, he stated that he was satisfied that the evidence presented was sufficient to decide the case without cross examination.. After reviewing the conduct of the court proceedings in his decision, Judge Seyranian declared: The court awarded damages in the amount of $11.9 million, which at the time was the largest final libel award in American history.‚Äú. Only a small fraction of the judgment was ever paid. SCP later claimed that the only reason they lost the litigation was that a protracted discovery process had drained their financial resources.Bill Squires, ‚ÄúThe Lawsuit in Perspective,‚Äù SCP Newsletter 11:4, November 1986:7‚Äì8. However, a recent publication has challenged the veracity of this claim using SCP's own financial reports.. Reaction to the decision The outcome of the cases was widely dismissed by the countercult community and the Christian press.‚ÄúCult‚Äôs Lawsuit Drives Christian Company to Bankruptcy,‚Äù Christian Life, June 1985:14.‚ÄúBankrupt: Spiritual Counterfeits Runs Out of Money,‚Äù Charisma, June 1985:95.‚ÄúLibel Suit Forces Ministry into Bankruptcy,‚Äù The Christian Courier, April 1985:12.‚ÄúProlonged Legal Battle Forces Research Organization into Federal Bankruptcy Court,‚Äù Christianity Today 29:6, April 5, 1985:41.‚ÄúLibel Suit Pushes SCP to Bankruptcy,‚Äù Evangelical Beacon, April 15, 1985:15. Elliot Miller, Editor-in-Chief of Christian Research Journal, later described the countercult community's rejection of the court's decision as ‚Äúsuppressing truth for the sake of a common cause and camaraderie among colleagues.‚ÄùElliot Miller, ‚ÄúPart 5: Addressing the Open Letter‚Äôs Concerns: On Lawsuits with Evangelical Christians,‚Äù Christian Research Journal 32:6, 2009:42. As a result, The Mindbenders and The God-Men shaped others' perceptions of Witness Lee and the local churches for many years. Among those who disagreed with these publications was Dr. J. Gordon Melton, who published an open letter in which he faulted the research and apologetic method of The God-Men and stated that Witness Lee's teachings had been grossly misrepresented.J. Gordon Melton, An Open Letter Concerning the Local Church, Witness Lee and The God-Men Controversy. (Santa Barbara, CA: Institute for the Study of American Religion, 1985) available at www.contendingforthefaith.org/libel-litigations/god-men/OpenLtr/index.html. Melton called for The God-Men and other attacks derived from it to be discarded. He further called for ‚Äúother more capable and responsible Christian scholars‚Äù to review and examine Witness Lee's teachings. Former SCP researcher renews controversy In 1999, a chapter on the local churches and Living Stream Ministry (LSM), the publisher of the ministry of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, appeared in Encyclopedia of Cults and New Religions (ECNR), by John Ankerberg and John Weldon, published by Harvest House.John Ankerberg and John Weldon, Encyclopedia of Cults and New Religions (Eugene, OR: Harvest House Publishers, 1999). Weldon had worked for both SCP and Christian Research Institute (CRI) between 1975 and 1985. Weldon had written a draft for a proposed encyclopedia in the early 1980s as part of a ‚Äúdoctoral dissertation‚Äù at Pacific School of Graduate Studies, a now defunct diploma mill. Weldon's draft included a ‚ÄúLocal Church‚Äù chapter that was based on and incorporated large portions of The God-Men manuscript. Representatives of the local churches and LSM wrote to the authors and the publisher of ECNR protesting their inclusion in the book.‚ÄúLetters of Protest Written Prior to Litigation,‚Äù www.contendingforthefaith.org/libel-litigations/harvest-house-et- al/PublicDocs/letters.html. They made several attempts to meet personally with Ankerberg and Harvest House president Robert Hawkins, Jr. These overtures, some made through third parties with connections to the publisher, were ignored or rejected. Harvest House sued the Church in Fullerton on December 14, 2001, in an Oregon court, claiming that the letters of protest and accompanying documentation sent to them were a form of harassment.See ‚ÄúJudgment of Dismissal,‚Äù www.contendingforthefaith.org/libel- litigations/harvest-house-et-al/PublicDocs/pd13.pdf. Because Harvest House refused to sign a tolling agreement to extend the statute of limitations, ninety-nine local churches and LSM initiated a libel action against the authors and the publisher on December 31, 2001.‚ÄúPlaintiffs Original Petition,‚Äù www.contendingforthefaith.org/libel-litigations/harvest-house-et- al/PublicDocs/pd12.pdf. The Circuit Court of the State of Oregon dismissed Harvest House's lawsuit on March 15, 2002.Circuit Court of the State of Oregon, Judgment of Dismissal, Harvest House Publishers v. The Church in Fullerton, case # 12-01-24034. The churches‚Äô complaint alleged that ECNR characterized the groups identified in the book as being guilty of criminal and sociological aberrations, including ‚Äúsubjecting members to physical harm,‚Äù ‚Äúfraud or deception concerning fund raising or financial costs,‚Äù ‚Äúacceptance of shamanism,‚Äù ‚Äúparticipating in drug smuggling and other criminal activities,‚Äù ‚Äúmurder,‚Äù ‚Äúencouraging prostitution,‚Äù ‚Äúchild molestation,‚Äù and ‚Äúpracticing black magic and witchcraft.‚Äù‚ÄúLetters of Protest Written Prior to Litigation,‚Äù January 11-November 20, 2001, www.contendingforthefaith.org/libel-litigations/harvest-house-et- al/PublicDocs/letters.html. The complaint was based on the structure of ECNR, which was in three parts: * An introduction defining the characteristics of cults * The main body of the book, containing chapters on individual groups; and * An appendix addressing points of doctrine and claims of occult involvement in the new religions. The complaint alleged that by identifying characteristics of cults and then naming the local churches as a cult, a reasonable reader would apply the defined characteristics to the local churches. The trial court rejected multiple summary judgment motions from the defendants, ruling that a jury should decide how a reasonable reader would understand the book. However, on January 5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the First District of Texas reversed the trial court and ruled that the complaint of language in the book could not be understood to be ‚Äúof and concerning‚Äù the plaintiffs. Their opinion stated that a reader could not reasonably construe the ‚ÄúCharacteristics of Cults‚Äù as itemized in ECNR‚Äôs Introduction as applying to every group discussed in the individual chapters.‚ÄúHarvest House Publishers, John Ankerberg, and John Weldon v. The Local Church, et al.‚ÄîAppeal from 80th District Court of Harris County.‚Äù law.justia.com/cases/texas/first-court-of- appeals/2006/82536.html. Both the Supreme Court of Texas and the U. S. Supreme Court declined to review appeals. Neither of these courts ruled on the correctness of the Appeals Court decision, nor did they review the merits of the churches‚Äô original complaint. Differing opinions among Evangelicals In the first decade of the 21st century, two different groups initiated multi- year studies of the local churches, such as J. Gordon Melton called for in 1985. One was undertaken by a panel of faculty members from Fuller Theological Seminary, including President Richard J. Mouw, Dean of Theology Howard Loewen, and Professor of Systematic Theology Veli-Matti K√§rkk√§inen; the other was by Christian Research Institute, headed by Hank Hanegraaff, along with Answers in Action, headed by Gretchen Passantino. The Fuller panel stated: :It is the conclusion of Fuller Theological Seminary that the teachings and practices of the local churches and its members represent the genuine, historical, biblical Christian faith in every essential aspect.Dr. Richard Mouw, Dr. Howard Loewen, and Dr. Veli-Matti K√§rk√§innen, A statement by a faculty panel at Fuller Theological Seminary, January 5, 2006, www.lctestimony.org/FullerStatement.pdf. The Fuller panel further wrote that ‚Äúthe teachings of Witness Lee have been grossly misrepresented and therefore most frequently misunderstood in the general Christian community, especially among those who classify themselves as evangelicals.‚ÄùDr. Richard Mouw, Dr. Howard Loewen, and Dr. Veli-Matti K√§rk√§innen, A statement by a faculty panel at Fuller Theological Seminary, January 5, 2006, www.lctestimony.org/FullerStatement.pdf. Christianity Today endorsed the Fuller panel's findings in an editorial in its March 2006 issue.‚ÄúLoose Cult Talk,‚Äù Christianity Today 50:3, March 2006, www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/march/15.27.html. In 2007, during the appeals of the ECNR litigation, a group of ‚Äúevangelical scholars and ministry leaders‚Äù published an open letter calling on the leadership of LSM and the local churches to disavow certain statements by Witness Lee and the use of litigation against fellow Christians.‚ÄúAn Open Letter to the Leadership of Living Stream Ministry and the ‚ÄòLocal Churches‚Äô,‚Äù December 2006, open- letter.org/. Representatives of the local churches and LSM published a brief and a longer response to their open letter.‚ÄúA Brief Response to ‚ÄòAn Open Letter to the Leadership of Living Stream Ministry and the ‚ÄúLocal Churches‚Äù‚Äô‚Äù (lctestimony.org/ResponseToOpenLetter.pdf).‚ÄúA Longer Response to ‚ÄòAn Open Letter to the Leadership of Living Stream Ministry and the ‚ÄúLocal Churches‚Äù‚Äô‚Äù (lctestimony.org/LongerResponseToOpenLetter.pdf). In late 2009 CRI dedicated an issue of Christian Research Journal to present the findings of a six-year primary research project examining the teachings and practices of the local churches.‚ÄúWe Were Wrong: A Reassessment of the ‚ÄòLocal Church‚Äô Movement of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee,‚Äù Christian Research Journal 32:6, 2009, available at ‚ÄúConcerning the Local Churches,‚Äù (www.equip.org/localchurch/). Hank Hanegraaff, representing CRI, an early critic of Witness Lee and the local churches, wrote, ‚ÄúThe result of our primary research is encapsulated in the following three words: ‚ÄòWe were wrong!‚Äô‚ÄùHank Hanegraaff, ‚ÄúFrom the President: We Were Wrong!,‚Äù Christian Research Journal 32:6, 2009:4. The issue contained a seven-part article by Elliot Miller reassessing the local churches and responding to the 2007 open letter. The issue included two statements by Hank Hanegraaff and an article by Gretchen Passantino in which she explained why she reversed her earlier critical opinion. In early January 2010 Norman Geisler authored a rebuttal, co-signed by Ron Rhodes, in which they made numerous accusations against both CRI and the local churches.Norman Geisler and Ron Rhodes, ‚ÄúA Response to the Christian Research Journal‚Äôs Recent Defense of the ‚ÄòLocal Church‚Äô Movement,‚Äù normangeisler.net/articles/theLocalChurch/2009-ResponseToCRIDefenseLocalChurch.htm. In late spring of the same year Hank Hanegraaff wrote an article titled ‚ÄúDiscernment in an Age of Information Overload,‚Äù in which he outlined principles for performing discernment ministry using the article by Geisler and Rhodes and the 2007 ‚Äúopen letter‚Äù as examples of how not to do apologetics.Hank Hanegraaff, ‚ÄúDiscernment in an Age of Information Overload,‚Äù Christian Research Journal 33:3, 2010:10-15 (www.equip.org/articles/discernment-in-an-age-of-information-overload/). In July 2010 Defense & Confirmation Project (DCP) began publishing a series of fourteen articles responding in detail to Geisler and Rhodes‚Äô statement.‚ÄúA Response to Norman Geisler and Ron Rhodes‚Äô Defense of the ‚ÄòOpen Letter‚Äô and Critique of the Christian Research Journal‚Äôs Reassessment of the Local Churches,‚Äù www.contendingforthefaith.org/responses/Geisler-Rhodes/index.html. These articles and related materials were subsequently published in a series of books titled Brothers, Hear Our Defense.See ‚ÄúBrothers, Hear Our Defense,‚Äù www.contendingforthefaith.org/brothershearourdefense.html. Theological controversies Some of the beliefs of local churches at times are quite different with that of Evangelical Christianity although most of them are in line with the evangelical orthodoxy. Since 1975, critics of Witness Lee and the local churches have focused on three main areas: * Deification; * Concerning the nature of God; * Concerning God‚Äôs full salvation; and * Concerning the church. Deification In his later ministry, Witness Lee used the term deification to refer to the process of God‚Äôs organic salvation. He said: The last of these statements echoes Athanasius‚Äô aphorism, ‚ÄúŒ±œÖœÑŒøœÇ Œ≥Œ±œÅ ŒµŒΩŒ∑ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ, ŒπŒΩŒ± Œ∑ŒºŒµŒπœÇ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÄŒøŒπŒ∑Œ∏œâŒºŒµŒΩ\\" (‚ÄúFor He was made man in order that we might be made God‚Äù).. The subject of deification in various Christian traditions has been the subject of much recent study.......Jules Gross, The Divinization of the Christian According to the Greek Fathers, trans. by Paul Onica (Anaheim, CA: A&C; Press, 2002).Veli-Matti K√§rkk√§inen, One with God: Salvation as Deification and Justification (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 2004).Tuomo Mannermaa, Christ Present in Faith: Luther‚Äôs View of Justification (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2005).Stephen Finlan and Vladimir Kharlamov, eds., Theosis: Deification in Christian Theology (Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2006).. Two messages by Witness Lee on this subject have been reprinted in LSM journal Affirmation & Critique (A&C;)... In addition, A&C; has devoted the majority of three issues to the subject.... Nevertheless, both Lutheran and Calvinist Christians reject the teaching of deification due to their rejection of Christian perfection. Concerning the Nature of God The Triune God was a major point of emphasis in the ministry of Witness Lee.See ‚ÄúThe Triune God‚Äù at www.an-open-letter.org/resources/triune-god. He taught six basic principles concerning the Triune God: *God is one (Deut. 6:4; 1 Cor. 8:4b; Isa. 45:5a); * God also has the aspect of being three persons (or hypostases)‚Äîthe Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19); * All three‚Äîthe Father, the Son, and the Spirit‚Äîare God (1 Pet. 1:2; Heb. 1:8; Acts 5:3-4); * All three of the Godhead are eternal (Isa. 9:6; Heb. 7:3; 9:14); * All three of the Godhead co-exist simultaneously (John 14:16-17; Eph. 3:14-17; 2 Cor. 13:14); and * All three of the Godhead coinhere, that is, they mutually indwell one another (John 14:10-11; 17:21, 23).Witness Lee, Truth Lessons, Level 1, Volume 1 (Anaheim, CA: Living Stream Ministry, 1985), 13-24, www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=A509UJXZ4INR4, chapter 2.Witness Lee, Lesson Book, Level 2: The Triune God‚ÄîThe Triune God and the Person and Work of Christ (Anaheim, CA: Living Stream Ministry, 1990), 13-17, www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=CZ05IK3F9CAOV, chapter 2. However, critics have accused Witness Lee and the local churches of teaching modalism, due to his identification of Christ with the Spirit based on 1 Corinthians 15:45 and 2 Corinthians 3:17. According to modalism (a heresy condemned by the early church) the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not eternally co-existent, but are three successive manifestations of God. Similarly, because of his reading of Isaiah 9:6, which says that the Son given to mankind will be called the eternal Father, Witness Lee has been accused of teaching patripassianism (a subcategory of modalism). Witness Lee and others in the local churches have pointed to passages in the Bible that indicate the coinherence of the three of the Divine Trinity. In the mid-1970s LSM published four booklets to explain their understanding of the Trinity.Witness Lee, The Clear Scriptural Revelation Concerning the Triune God (Anaheim, CA: Living Stream Ministry, undated), www.contendingforthefaith.org/responses/booklets/triune.html.Ron Kangas, Modalism, Tritheism, or the Pure Revelation of the Triune God According to the Bible (Anaheim, CA: Living Stream Ministry, 1976), www.contendingforthefaith.org/responses/booklets/modalism.html.Witness Lee, The Revelation of the Triune God According to the Pure Word of the Bible (Anaheim, CA: Living Stream Ministry, 1976), www.contendingforthefaith.org/responses/booklets/revelation.html.Witness Lee, What a Heresy‚ÄîTwo Divine Fathers, Two Life-Giving Spirits, and Three Gods! (Anaheim, CA: Living Stream Ministry, 1977), www.contendingforthefaith.org/responses/booklets/heresy.html. These publications discuss the error of modalism and affirm that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not temporary manifestations but are co-eternal. The first issue of the LSM journal Affirmation & Critique (A&C;), published in 1996, discussed the local churches‚Äô view of biblical trinitarianism.‚ÄúKnowing the Triune God,‚Äù Affirmation & Critique I:1, January 1996, www.affcrit.com/archives/ac_96_01.html. More recent defenses are included in the book Brothers, Hear Our Defense (2): Concerning the Divine Trinity.Brothers, Hear Our Defense 2: Concerning the Trinity (Fullerton, CA: DCP Press, 2011), www.contendingforthefaith.org/eBooks/Hear Our Defense (2)--The Divine Trinity.pdf. Concerning God‚Äôs Full Salvation Based on Romans 5:10 Witness Lee taught that God's full salvation has two aspects. The first is judicial and is carried out through the death of Christ, by which the believers are redeemed and reconciled to God. The second is organic and is carried out through the life of Christ, which causes the believers to grow, be transformed, and mature until they are conformed to the image of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29; 1 John 3:2).Witness Lee, God‚Äôs Salvation in Life (Anaheim, CA: Living Stream Ministry, 2001), www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=US3NL0A5VTXPY.Witness Lee, Salvation in Life in the Book of Romans (Anaheim, CA: Living Stream Ministry, 1990), www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=VIBZ9LASWULJ3.Witness Lee, The Organic Aspect of God‚Äôs Salvation (Anaheim, CA: Living Stream Ministry, 1996), www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=AAGOOQ5DIZLCN.Witness Lee, The Secret of God‚Äôs Organic Salvation: ‚ÄúThe Spirit Himself with Our Spirit‚Äù (Anaheim, CA: Living Stream Ministry, 1996), www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=14WPM1ZHC04VI. Mingling Witness Lee's view of God's organic salvation is related to his understanding of Christology, specifically, the relationship between the divine and human natures in Christ. Witness Lee cited the example of the meal offering in Leviticus which is composed of oil mingled with fine flour (Lev. 2:5), a type that other Bible teachers, including the Plymouth Brethren, also understood to refer to the dual nature of Christ, that is, His divinity and His humanity.C. H. Mackintosh, Notes on the Book of Leviticus (New York: Loizeaux Brothers, 1881), 37‚Äì38f, https://archive.org/details/notesonbookoflev00mack.John Nelson Darby, Notes and Comments on Scripture, Volume 2 (Sunbury, PA: Believers Bookshelf, 1971), 17.. Lee explained his use of the word mingling as follows: Critics claimed that mingling of necessity involved the producing of a third nature, which is known in history as the Eutychian heresy.Jack Sparks, The Mindbenders (Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1977, 1979), 237. However, Witness Lee stated that his use of the term mingle was consistent with dictionary definitions (e.g., ‚Äúto bring or combine together or with something else so that the components remain distinguishable in the combination‚ÄùWebster‚Äôs Third New International Dictionary, Philip Babcock Gove et al, eds. (Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, 2002), 1438.). He also pointed out that the Eutychian heresy was rejected at the Council of Chalcedon.Witness Lee, Concerning the Person of Christ (Anaheim, CA: Living Stream Ministry, 1981).Philip Schaff and Henry Wace, gen. eds., A Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, Second Series, Volume 14: The Seven Ecumenical Councils, Henry R. Percival, ed. (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1899, 1979), 264‚Äì65, http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xi.xiii.html: This one and the same Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son [of God] must be confessed to be in two natures, unconfusedly, immutably, indivisibly, distinctly, inseparably [united], and that without the distinction of natures being taken away by such union, but rather the peculiar property of each nature being preserved and being united in one Person and subsistence‚Ä¶ More recent articles in A&C; have addressed this controversy.‚Äú‚ÄòMingling‚Äô‚ÄîWas There Ever a Better Word?,‚Äù Affirmation & Critique I:3, July 1996:31‚Äì32, http://www.affcrit.com/pdfs/1996/03/96_03_a3.pdf.. Concerning the Church Watchman Nee taught that the universal church, the Body of Christ, is properly expressed in local churches, that is, local assemblies consisting of all believers in their respective localities. His most comprehensive exposition of this principle can be found in The Normal Christian Church Life,. although there are significant treatments of the subject in other books as well.... This teaching is based on the New Testament examples of the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), the church in Antioch (Acts 13:1), the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), the seven churches in seven cities in Asia (Rev. 1:11), etc. Watchman Nee and his co-workers, including Witness Lee, established local churches throughout China according to this principle. Witness Lee continued to follow and expound this principle in his work and ministry.... He pointed out that in Acts 14:23 Paul and his co-workers appointed elders in every church upon their return to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, while in Titus 1:5, Paul charged his co-worker to appoint elders in every city. This, Lee said, showed that the elders in the church equaled the elders in the city, meaning that the boundary of the church was the city.. Furthermore, he noted that even though there were thousands of believers in Jerusalem, the church there was referred to in the singular and there was only one group of elders in the church... Witness Lee was often critical of the organized system of Christianity, saying that it had deviated from the biblical revelation. He identified three inherent deficiencies in this system: * There are many substitutes for the living person of Christ; * The clergy/laity system nullifies the proper function of the believers; and * The divided state of the denominational/free group system is contrary to biblical injunctions to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.. Critics represented Witness Lee's criticisms of organized Christianity as an attack on Christians and even on the Christian faith..

While often looked over, communication noise can have a profound impact both on our perception of [social interactioninteractions] with others and our analysis of our own communication proficiency. Forms of communication noise include psychological noise, physical noise, physiological and semantic noise. All these forms of noise subtly, yet greatly influence our communication with others and are vitally important to anyone‚Äôs skills as a competent communicator. Psychological noise Psychological noise results from preconceived notions we bring to conversations, such as stereotypes, reputations, biases, and assumptions. When we come into a conversation with ideas about what the other person is going to say and why, we can easily become blinded to their original message. Most of the time psychological noise is impossible to free ourselves from, and we must simply strive to recognize that it exists and take those distractions into account when we converse with others. Environmental Noise Environmental noise is a summary of noise pollution form of outside, causing by transportion, industry and recreational activitys. Physical noise Physical noise is any external or environmental stimulus that distracts us from receiving the intended message sent by a communicator (Rothwell 11). Examples of physical noise include: others talking in the background, background music, a startling noise and acknowledging someone outside of the conversation. Semantic noise This is noise that is often caused by the sender (also known as either the encoder or the source). This type of noise occurs when grammar or technical language is used that the receiver (the decoder) cannot understand, or cannot understand it clearly. It occurs when the sender of the message uses a word or a phrase that we don't know the meaning of, or which we use in a different way from the speakers. This is usually due to the result that the encoder had failed to practice audience analysis at first. The type of audience is the one that determine the jargon one will use.

Its weight and fine finish make it unsuitable for daily transportation to rehearsals and gigs. A music stand is a pedestal or elevated rack designed to hold a paper score or sheets of music in position for reading. Most music stands for orchestral, chamber music or solo orchestra- family instruments (violin, oboe, trumpet, etc.) can be raised or lowered to accommodate seated or standing performers, or performers of different heights. Many types of keyboard instruments have a built-in or removable music rack or stand where sheet music can be placed. Music stands enable musicians to read sheet music or scores while playing an instrument or conducting, as the stand leaves the hands free. Music stands are sometimes used by singers, however for choirs, singers typically hold their sheet music in a folder, and singers performing solo recitals or opera performances typically memorize the lyrics and melodies. Some singers use stands, such as lounge singers and wedding vocalists who have a repertoire of hundreds of songs, which makes remembering all of the verses difficult. Types A vocal group using music stands. There are various types of music stands for different purposes and intended users. Folding stands collapse, which makes them convenient to take to rehearsals and performances out of the home. Folding stands are typically used by amateur musicians at rehearsals and performances. Professional musicians are more likely to limit their use of folding stands to rehearsals held outside of normal performance venues (e.g., a chamber music rehearsal at a private home) or small gigs. Non-folding stands tend to be used by professional orchestras and big bands for rehearsals and concerts. FoldingLightweight= A folding music stand in its collapsed position, ready for transportation. Folding stands range from inexpensive, lightweight models made of metal, which are designed to hold a few pages of sheet music or a thin songbook, to stronger, more expensive heavy-duty models. Metal folding stands often have solid wire extensions or metal \\"arms\\" which can be folded out to support more than two pages of music or over-size sheets or pages. This is the kind most often used by music students in youth orchestras. Lightweight folding stands are designed to collapsible; if folding stands did not collapse, they would be awkward and unwieldy to carry. The collapsible nature of folding stands makes them small enough to slip into many instrument cases or backpacks. This feature makes folding stands more portable. As such, they are a popular stand type for rehearsals, auditions and even some types of performances. Amateur orchestras and some youth orchestras may ask members to bring folding stands to rehearsals, and sometimes also to performances, as this saves the ensemble the cost of buying or renting, and transporting one or more racks of non- folding stands. Lightweight stands are not designed to support heavy books of music such as full-size fake books; while the fake book may stay open on the stand, the music stand may fall over. Folding stands consist of a rack for the music and a telescoping cylindrical column for supporting the rack, with screws or other fastening devices to secure the extended columns at the desired height. Folding stands typically have a foldable tripod that supports the column and the music shelf. The rack area for holding the music is either pre-set at a slight incline away from the performer (as compared with being straight up), so that a song book or √©tude book will lie open naturally, or the degree of incline can be adjusted by the performer (on more expensive stands). The portability of lightweight music stands can lead to some problems. Heavy fake books or full scores may overload the stand, leading to it falling over when a performer turns a page. As well, when a lightweight stand is used with its column fully extended, as by a standing orchestral timpanist or double bass player, a heavy part may be \\"tippy\\" on the over- extended column. Oversized parts, which are used in some contemporary classical music, may be too wide to be supported by the stand; a solution that some musicians use is to use multiple stands for oversize parts. As well, during outdoor performances, such as playing at a wedding, picnic or a bandstand, lightweight stands may be blown over by wind, which can interrupt a performance or even, if the stand strikes an instrument, damage the finish of an instrument. =Heavy duty= Heavy duty folding models typically use a hollow cylindrical column as the main support and three cylindrical columns arrayed in a tripod to ensure the stand stays upright. Heavy duty stands can reliably support a thick, several hundred page fake book, song book or a binder full of songs. The height of the column can be raised or lowered to permit the stand to be used for a seated performer (common for most orchestral instruments, except for percussion and sometimes double bass) or a standing performer. Non-folding Musicians leaving a wedding performance carry non-folding music stands. Professional orchestras, concert bands and big bands typically use non-portable, non-folding heavy-duty stands. The stands are typically coloured or painted black so that the stands blend in with the black clothing of the musicians and are not distracting. The music holding portion of the stand may be plastic or metal, and in both cases, the music holding portion is supported by a metal column. The part supporting the music often has a shelf below it for pencils, rosin (for string players), and other rehearsal accessories. The metal column can be raised or lowered to put the stand at the desired height. Professional stands can be lowered to be used for a seated performer or raised for standing performers. Some non-folding stands have perforations in the music rack to reduce the weight of the stand, an especially important consideration when a large number of stands are being moved. These stands do not fold or collapse (apart from the ability to lower the height of the stand) and are thus rarely used by musicians travelling alone or one-by-one to rehearsals or gigs. The stands can be moved, but for a full orchestra to move its 50-100 stands, which are often loaded onto a heavy rack, a moving truck and movers need to be hired to relocate the stands. Professional stands either have some type of tripod-style or quadruped-style base, or they have a heavy, metal base, often circular. An expensive antique music stand. Some musicians use non-folding, professional stands for all of their rehearsals and gigs, even though this may require them to take more trips to load their gear into the hall. The reason some musicians choose to use non-folding stands is because they are more stable, even with heavy parts or scores, they are more resistant to falling over during outdoor shows, and they look more professional. As well, some performers like to have access to a shelf underneath their stand, to obtain music accessories that are needed throughout a rehearsal or show (e.g., pencils, rosin for string players, picks for guitar players, reeds for reed players, valve oil for brass players, a tuning key for percussionists, etc.) Musicians may also have expensive non- folding stands in their homes or music studios made of wood or metal. These stands are not designs that are meant to be relocated. Due to their weight and/or their delicate finishes, they are intended to be used in a single location, such as a private home. Some heavy stands are made of carved wood and feature bas relief carvings and inlay work. Other heavy stands are made of brass, and feature musical motifs such as treble clefs. Some of these heavy stands are objects of art in their own right. Digital Digital music stands that use a computer screen to display the music began being used in the 1990s and 2000s. The digital \\"pages\\" can be turned by pressing an electronic footpedal, thus enabling performers to play chamber music or solo pieces with difficult page turns without hiring or finding a volunteer to act as a page turner. The music notation is typically displayed on a flatscreen display or a tablet computer screen. Marching band A marching band \\"clip\\" for a trumpet player. Marching band or some brass band members use a small sheet holder called a lyre or a clip which, can be attached to an instrument. The clip holds a smaller-sized part for the performer, so she/he can read the music while marching. Conducting A large, heavy conductor's stand. Large, heavy duty music stands are available for conductors of orchestras, concert bands, choirs and big bands to hold their heavy, over-size scores of music. These stands are typically not designed to be easily transportable, and they are usually intended for installation in a rehearsal hall or concert hall. Conductor's stands have to be able to be angled much flatter than an instrumentalist's stand, because the conductor reads from a large full-score, which contains the parts for all of the instruments. For some symphonies, the score can be both thick and heavy; to ensure that the stand is stable, a conducting stand needs to have a heavy, wide base and a sturdy platform for the score. As with professional instrumentalist stands, some conducting stands have a narrow shelf where a conductor can store her batons, handkerchiefs, reading glasses, and, for rehearsals, a small metronome. Keyboard instruments Upright pianos, grand pianos, stage pianos, harpsichords, pipe organs, Hammond organs and many post-1980s electronic keyboards have some type of rack or stand to hold sheet music and/or scores. On some grand pianos, the music stand can be removed, for example, if the performer is playing a piano solo work or a piano concerto from memory. On some electronic or electric keyboards, the stand can be removed, to facilitate transportation of the instrument to rehearsals and gigs. If the music stands on electronic and electric keyboards were permanently affixed, they would make the instrument harder to load into a van or car, and the stand would be vulnerable to damage. A Korg LP350 electronic keyboard with a music stand on the top of the instrument. On some digital pianos designed for use in a private home or studio, the music rack is permanently installed, but most users of digital pianos do not transport them to rehearsals and gigs, because these instruments often have a number of design features that are not conducive to regular transport (e.g., fixed keyboard legs and a modesty panel and fixed pedals for sustain and sostenuto). Most keyboardists who are regularly transporting electronic keyboards to rehearsals and gigs use stage pianos or MIDI controller keyboards along with a sound module; on these instruments, all of the accessories (music rack, keyboard stand, sustain pedal) can be disconnected. By enabling the keyboard to be broken down into separate components, it makes the instrument more transportable in a regular car, even including small vehicles. In contrast, a high-end digital piano with a fixed music rack, stand and pedals would need a van and several helpers to transport it. Tabletop A table top stand. While the vast majority of music stands are designed to provide their own support for raising the music rack to the desired height, there are some music racks which are designed for placing on a table or counter. Since a table or counter must be used, this makes these racks unsuitable for instruments such as timpani. Challenges With outdoor performances, users of music stands can face challenges due to wind blowing the pages of sheet music off the stand or blowing the pages to an incorrect page. To resolve this challenge, performers use metal clips or clothes pins on the sides of the music or lay a sheet of plexiglass over the stand. While these methods prevent the music or pages from being blown by the wind, they make page turns more difficult. As well, users of lightweight folding stand may face challenges on windy days, as the opened pages of a music part may act like a sail and catch the wind, which can lead to the entire stand blowing over. Heavy-duty folded stands, and professional stands are less likely to blow over in outdoor concerts, due to their greater weight. In outdoor concerts where windy conditions are a problem, the most wind-resistant stand is a professional, non-folding stand with a heavy, weighted base. In opera, ballet and musical theatre, the orchestra (or band in the case of musicals) often plays in an orchestra pit in front of and at a lower level than the main performance stage. For dramatic reasons, the stage may be darkened at times during the performance, and the house lights turned off. This darkness could pose challenges for the musicians who are reading parts or chord charts in the pit. To resolve this challenge, small stand lights are clipped onto the tops of stands. To avoid having the stand lights distract audience members, some venues have cloth \\"hoods\\" over the lights. Originally, stand lights were incandescent, requiring extension cords running throughout the pit and regular bulb changes. In the 2000s, as LED lights became more affordable, battery powered LED lights have become widely used. LED lights do not need extension cords and the bulbs almost never need replacement. Stand lights do not clip as securely to thin folding stands. Stand lights clip more securely onto the solid rack of a professional, non-folding stand. A Canadian viola player invented a stand with a built-in LED light, for dark performing settings. Comparison with music desk The term stand, as it is used to describe furniture such as a plant stand or music stand, generally implies a relatively small surface area supported at the required height, most usually by a turned leg or support known as a standard. Any inclined surface that can be used for supporting music may be thought of a music stand, although generally this function is divided between two types of furniture: a music stand proper and a music desk. The music stand, as the name suggests, consists of a support for the music raised upon a freestanding column or tripod, which, in addition to being movable may also be adjustable with regard to its height and the angle at which it may be tilted. A music desk generally implies a similar, tiltable support for the music, but rather than being raised on a stand, instead forms part of a table. In as much as the term \\"desk\\" originally implied a sloping- topped table for reading or writing, the slight adjustment necessary to turn a desk into a music desk was a relatively simple matter.

It includes many details about the wider Moroccan empire in Iberian Peninsula and Algeria. The work is usually known by its short title Rawd al-Qirtas meaning The Gardens of Pages. It is said that this has a double meaning in that there was a public garden in Fes called The Garden of al- Qirtas, the latter name being a nickname of Ziri ibn Atiyya.See introduction by Huici Miranda to the Spanish translation The work has always been very popular in Morocco, and continues so to the present day. In the days before printing, this popularity led to a large number of variant manuscripts. A consequence of this is some uncertainty about the author, who is given in some versions as Ibn Abi Zar of Fes, and by some as Salih ibn Abd al-Halim of Granada. The consensus of modern opinionSee e.g. notes by Tayeb Habi to the Editions La Porte 1999 edition of Beaumier's translation. is that the original author is Ibn Abi Zar as stated by Ibn Khaldun, and that Abd al-Halim is merely a summarizer at best. The double meaning of the title, the detailed history of Fes and numerous mistakes in the geography of Iberia, are cited as evidence that the author was a native of Fes. The scope of the history is from the advent of Idris I in 788 to the Marinid Dynasty up to 1326. The work falls into four sections, each ending in a summary list of the events in each period: *The Idrisid and Maghrawa kings *The Almoravids *The Almohads *The Marinids Modern researchers consider that the first and last sections contain a valuable record of their respective periods, even if not completely free from errors. On the other hand, the sections on the Almoravids and Almohads are considered to be riddled with chronological and factual errors and omissions and make this work one of the least trustworthy sources for those periods. In light of these issues it is unfortunate that Ibn Khaldun chose the work as one of his primary sources of reference. A critical version of the Arabic text, utilizing all the manuscript versions then available, was published by Tornberg in 1843, and this is generally used as a basis for modern Arabic versions. Tornberg also gave a Latin translation. A French translation was published in 1860 by Beaumier but is based on fewer manuscripts and is considered faulty by modern standards.e.g. Biyuna is translated as Bayonne but is actually Iru√±a i.e. Pamplona, as pointed out by Huici Miranda The second (1964) edition of Huici Miranda's Spanish translation is heavily annotated and is considered authoritative.

By the end of 1940, Puett's gate was a fixture at all major North American race tracks. Prior to Puett's invention, races were commonly started with ropes, ribbons, or wooden barriers. As a young man, Puett had worked as a rider, as well as a starter, and knew of the dangers that were associated with these methods for starting a race. He began work on a prototype of his invention in 1931, while working as a starter in Greeley, Colorado.

The RAIR provides the upper anal canal with the ability to discriminate between flatus and fecal material. The ability of the rectum to discriminate between gaseous, liquid and solid contents is essential to the ability to voluntarily control defecation. The RAIR allows for voluntary flatulation to occur without also eliminating solid waste, irrespective of the presence of fecal material in the anal canal. Reflex arc The physiological basis for the RAIR is poorly understood, but it is thought to involve a coordinated response by the internal anal sphincter to rectal distention with recovery of anal pressure from the distal to the proximal sphincter. Mediated by the autonomic nervous system, the afferent limb of this reflex depends upon an intact network of interstitial cells of Cajal in the internal anal sphincter. These cells, which are mediated at least in part by nitric oxide, provide inhibitory innervation of the internal anal sphincter. Clinical significance Impairment of this reflex can result in fecal incontinence. The absence of a RAIR is pathognomonic for Hirschsprung's disease.

She was president of Fudan University from 1983 to 1989, and remained as advisor to the university from 1989 until her death. She helped to set up the university's Centre for American Studies and founded its Modern Physics Institute in 1977. Xie also served as a member in the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China from 1982 to 1992.  Biography  Xie Xide was born March 19, 1921 in the port city of Quanzhou in Fujian, southeastern China. She was born into a family that valued education. Her father Xie Yuming had a Ph.D. from University of Chicago and taught at Yenching University in Beijing. Xie Yuming precisely measured the spectrum of hydrogen atom during his study in the US. The famous theoretical physicist, Yang Chen-Ning referred to Xie Yuming as the person that the Nobel Prize missed. Xide spent part of her childhood in Beijing. She attended Yenching Elementary School and was a top student in school. She met Cao Tianqin when Cao transferred to Yenching. Cao constantly beat Xie in school performance and the two became good friends. When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, Xie when to Hunan University to study physics; but she had to withdraw from school due to illness of bone tuberculosis. Different hospitals diagnosed that her illness is not treatable so she returned home to fight the illness with her family's help. Cao started sending her numerous letters in the name of academic discussions, which helped Xie cheer up and continue her studies. In 1942, not only did Xie survive, through her self-study at home, she was also admitted to Xiamen University to study physics and mathematics. Xie graduated in 1946. She taught at University of Shanghai for a year, and then was able to get a scholarship to study for a master's degree in physics at Smith College in the United States, graduating in 1949. She continued her studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning a Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1951. In 1950, many Chinese science scholars were detained in the United States as political hostage against China arising from the Korean War, including the famous Chinese aerodynamicist, cyberneticist and politician Qian Xuesen. Xie was detained in the US despite her strong willingness to return to her motherland. From 1951 to 1952 she worked on the research staff at MIT. In 1952, Cao Tianqin, who was studying in United Kingdom at that time, obtained a \\"special certificate\\" to pledge for her release in order to have their wedding in UK. Xide was released. Cao Tianqin (Tien-chin Tsao) and Xie Xide were married in UK; their son was born in 1956. After marriage, Xie returned to China and became a lecturer in the Department of Physics at Fudan University in Shanghai, one of China's top universities. She served in this position from 1952 to 1956. She became an associate professor at Fudan and served in that capacity from 1956 to 1962. From 1958 to 1966 she served as adjunct director, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 1962 she was appointed Professor of Physics, Fudan University and continued in that capacity. Xie Xide was an outstanding educational leader, and also a key figure in the development of China's educational relations with the international community. She was a joint-author of one of the most widely used physics textbooks in China, \\"Semiconductor Physics\\". In 1958, she passed out in her lab due to overworking and was diagnosed with late-stage kidney stone and heart disease when she was sent to hospital. She resumed teaching after several big surgeries. In 1966, as numerous Cultural Revolution victims among China's educated scholars, Xide was sent to do hard labor choirs despite her illness; she was later diagnosed with breast cancer. She did not give up and still dedicated herself fully to education. In 1978, National Science Conference in Beijing was held and Xide resumed her occupation.History of science and technology in the People%27s Republic of China#1977-84: Rehabilitation and rethinking From 1978 to 1983 she served as Director of the Institute of Modern Physics of Fudan University. She was appointed vice president of Fudan in 1978, and President in 1983, serving in that capacity until 1988. During her tenure, she founded Center for American Studies in Fudan to encourage students to learn about world leading research and international relations. She was the first woman president of a major comprehensive university in the PRC. From 1985 she also served as Director of the Center for American Studies of Fudan University, and in 1988 she was appointed Advisor to Fudan University. Despite her health, she actively encouraged and recommended her students to study abroad. Xie Xide pursued a distinguished career as a scientist, making important contributions in the field of solid-state physics. Her research work was concentrated in solid state physics, semiconductor physics, and surface physics. Xie Xide was appointed to the Communist Party's Central Committee in 1982 and served as one of 210 full members. Xie Xide's husband, Cao Tianqin suffered a coma in 1987 when he was attending a global biology and ecology conference in Israel. He was since paralyzed in bed and suffered memory loss. Despite her own illness, Xide took care of Cao by planning his meal and helping him on physical therapy. She continued doing so for 8 years until Cao died in 1995. Xie continued her work in hospital as she fought with cancer. She died on March 4, 2000 and donated her whole body to China's medical research.

There are three schools in the system: an elementary school, a middle school and a high school. The school colors are red, white, and black. The mascot for the high school, middle school, and elementary school mascot is the Black Bear. As of 2018, the superintendent is Ned Williams, who has served Pawnee Public Schools since 1972, and the principal is Bobby Miller. History Early builders used native sandstone to construct the first school buildings. The original Pawnee High School had only eight classrooms. It was built by local contractor T.M. Grant, who completed the project in 1900. This structure was replaced in April 1912 with a three-story building which held grades one through twelve, administration offices, a 700-seat auditorium, and a gymnasium. The school was so large and imposing it was known locally as the Capitol Building, and it served the community until 1962. The school's first yearbook was published in 1919. One of the students to work on it was Chester Gould, who later became famous for creating the Dick Tracy comic strip in the 1930s. In 1943, the Works Project Administration built a new grade school using rocks from the old school building. Reflecting the nature of the times, a separate school for African-American students was built in September 1948. In 1972, Pawnee joined with the Morrison, Glencoe, Stillwater, Mulhall- Orlando, and Guthrie school districts to form a vocational-technical school to help students pursue a vocational trade after high school. Meridian Technology Center continues to serve these communities. The newest building project for the Pawnee Public School system is the construction of an 8,000 square foot domed tornado shelter which sits in the middle of the elementary school campus. It was completed in early 2015 and can fit the entire school population of more than 1,000 people. Present Day Currently, the school system includes an elementary school for kindergarten through fifth grade, a middle school for grades six through eight, and a high school for grades nine through twelve. The high school has an active Academic Team, band, student council, and Future Farmers of America (FFA) chapter. http://kotv.images.worldnow.com/images/21883208_BG5.jpg References Category:Public high schools in Oklahoma Category:Schools in Pawnee County, Oklahoma Category:Pawnee, Oklahoma ","title":"Pawnee High School"},{"id":"10156408","text":"Mister C's Steak House was a landmark Italian restaurant located at 5319 North 30th Street in North Omaha, Nebraska.

It remains the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history. The revolutions were essentially democratic and liberal in nature, with the aim of removing the old monarchical structures and creating independent nation-states. The revolutions spread across Europe after an initial revolution began in France in February. Over 50 countries were affected, but with no significant coordination or cooperation among their respective revolutionaries. Some of the major contributing factors were widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership, demands for more participation in government and democracy, demands for freedom of the press, other demands made by the working class, the upsurge of nationalism, and the regrouping of established government forces.R.J.W. Evans and Hartmut Pogge von Strandmann, eds., The Revolutions in Europe 1848‚Äì1849 (2000) pp. v, 4 The uprisings were led by temporary coalitions of reformers, the middle classes (\\"the bourgeoisie\\") and workers.Edward Shorter, \\"Middle-class anxiety in the German revolution of 1848.\\" Journal of Social History (1969): 189-215. However the coalition did not hold together for long. Many of the revolutions were quickly suppressed; tens of thousands of people were killed, and many more were forced into exile. Significant lasting reforms included the abolition of serfdom in Austria and Hungary, the end of absolute monarchy in Denmark, and the introduction of representative democracy in the Netherlands. The revolutions were most important in France, the Netherlands, Italy, the Austrian Empire, and the states of the German Confederation that would make up the German Empire in the late 19th and early 20th century. Origins Map of Europe in 1848‚Äì1849 depicting the main revolutionary centres, important counter-revolutionary troop movements and states with abdications The revolutions arose from such a wide variety of causes that it is difficult to view them as resulting from a coherent movement or set of social phenomena. Numerous changes had been taking place in European society throughout the first half of the 19th century. Both liberal reformers and radical politicians were reshaping national governments. Technological change was revolutionizing the life of the working classes. A popular press extended political awareness, and new values and ideas such as popular liberalism, nationalism and socialism began to emerge. Some historians emphasize the serious crop failures, particularly those of 1846, that produced hardship among peasants and the working urban poor. Large swaths of the nobility were discontented with royal absolutism or near-absolutism. In 1846, there had been an uprising of Polish nobility in Austrian Galicia, which was only countered when peasants, in turn, rose up against the nobles.Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change, Routledge, 1998. . pp. 295‚Äì96. Additionally, an uprising by democratic forces against Prussia, planned but not actually carried out, occurred in Greater Poland. The middle and working classes thus shared a desire for reform, and agreed on many of the specific aims. Their participations in the revolutions, however, differed. While much of the impetus came from the middle classes, much of the cannon fodder came from the lower classes. The revolts first erupted in the cities. Urban workers Galician slaughter (Polish: Rze≈∫ galicyjska) by Jan Lewicki (1795‚Äì1871), depicting the massacre of Polish nobles by Polish peasants in Galicia in 1846. The population in French rural areas had risen rapidly, causing many peasants to seek a living in the cities. Many in the bourgeoisie feared and distanced themselves from the working poor. Many unskilled labourers toiled from 12 to 15 hours per day when they had work, living in squalid, disease-ridden slums. Traditional artisans felt the pressure of industrialization, having lost their guilds. Revolutionaries such as Karl Marx built up a following. The liberalisation of trade laws and the growth of factories had increased the gulf among master tradesmen, and journeymen and apprentices, whose numbers increased disproportionately by 93% from 1815 to 1848 in Germany. Significant proletarian unrest had occurred in Lyon in 1831 and 1834, and Prague in 1844. Jonathan Sperber has suggested that in the period after 1825, poorer urban workers (particularly day labourers, factory workers and artisans) saw their purchasing power decline relatively steeply: urban meat consumption in Belgium, France and Germany stagnated or declined after 1830, despite growing populations.Siemann, Wolfram, The German Revolution of 1848‚Äì1849 (London, 1998), p. 27; L√®v√™que, Pierre in Dowe, p. 93; Pech, Stanley Z. The Czech Revolution of 1848 (London, 1969), p. 14 The economic Panic of 1847 increased urban unemployment: 10,000 Viennese factory workers were made redundant and 128 Hamburg firms went bankrupt over the course of 1847.Siemann (1998); Pech, p. 14 With the exception of the Netherlands, there was a strong correlation among the countries that were most deeply affected by the industrial shock of 1847 and those that underwent a revolution in 1848.Berger, Helge, and Mark Spoerer. \\"Economic Crises and the European Revolutions of 1848.\\" The Journal of Economic History 61.2 (2001), p. 305 The situation in the German states was similar. Parts of Prussia were beginning to industrialize. During the decade of the 1840s, mechanized production in the textile industry brought about inexpensive clothing that undercut the handmade products of German tailors.Merriman, 1996, p. 724 Reforms ameliorated the most unpopular features of rural feudalism, but industrial workers remained dissatisfied with these and pressed for greater change. Urban workers had no choice but to spend half of their income on food, which consisted mostly of bread and potatoes. As a result of harvest failures, food prices soared and the demand for manufactured goods decreased, causing an increase in unemployment. During the revolution, to address the problem of unemployment, workshops were organized for men interested in construction work. Officials also set up workshops for women when they felt they were excluded. Artisans and unemployed workers destroyed industrial machines when they threatened to give employers more power over them. Rural areas Rural population growth had led to food shortages, land pressure, and migration, both within and from Europe, especially to the Americas. Peasant discontent in the 1840s grew in intensity: peasant occupations of lost communal land increased in many areas: those convicted of wood theft in the Rhenish Palatinate increased from 100,000 in 1829‚Äì30 to 185,000 in 1846‚Äì47.Sperber, Jonathan. The European Revolutions of 1848 (1994)p.90 In the years 1845 and 1846, a potato blight caused a subsistence crisis in Northern Europe, and encouraged the raiding of manorial potato stocks in Silesia in 1847. The effects of the blight were most severely manifested in the Great Irish Famine,Helen Litton, The Irish Famine: An Illustrated History, Wolfhound Press, 1995, but also caused famine-like conditions in the Scottish Highlands and throughout continental Europe. Harvests of rye in the Rhineland were 20% of previous levels, while the Czech potato harvest was reduced by a half.Sperber, Jonathan, Rhineland Radicals: The Democratic Movement and the Revolution of 1848 (Princeton, 1991), p. 140; Pech, Stanley Z. The Czech Revolution of 1848 (London, 1969), p. 45 These reduced harvests were accompanied by a steep rise in prices (the cost of wheat more than doubled in France and Habsburg Italy). There were 400 French food riots during 1846 to 1847, while German socio-economic protests increased from 28 during 1830 to 1839, to 103 during 1840 to 1847.Siemann, Wolfram, The German Revolution of 1848‚Äì1849 (London, 1998), p. 39 Central to long-term peasant grievances were the loss of communal lands, forest restrictions (such as the French Forest Code of 1827), and remaining feudal structures, notably the robot (labour obligations) that existed among the serfs and oppressed peasantry of the Habsburg lands.Rath, Reuben J. The Viennese Revolution of 1848 (New York, 1969), p. 12 Sperber, Jonathan. The European Revolutions of 1848 (1994), p. 40 Aristocratic wealth (and corresponding power) was synonymous with the ownership of farm lands and effective control over the peasants. Peasant grievances exploded during the revolutionary year of 1848, yet were often disconnected from urban revolutionary movements: the revolutionary S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi's popular nationalist rhetoric in Budapest did not translate into any success with the Magyar peasantry, while the Viennese democrat Hans Kudlich reported that his efforts to galvanise the Austrian peasantry had 'disappeared in the great sea of indifference and phlegm'.Sperber, Jonathan. The European Revolutions of 1848 (1994), pp. 152, 232. Role of ideas June Uprising of 1848 in Prague injected a strong political element into Czech National Revival. Despite forceful and often violent efforts of established and reactionary powers to keep them down, disruptive ideas gained popularity: democracy, liberalism, radicalism, nationalism, and socialism.Charles Breunig, The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789‚Äì1850 (1977) They demanded a constitution, universal manhood suffrage, press freedom, freedom of expression and other democratic rights, the establishment of civilian militia, liberation of peasants, liberalization of the economy, abolition of tariff barriers and the abolition of monarchical power structures in favor of the establishment of republican states, or at least the restriction of the prince power in the form of constitutional monarchies. In the language of the 1840s, 'democracy' meant replacing an electorate of property-owners with universal male suffrage. 'Liberalism' fundamentally meant consent of the governed, restriction of church and state power, republican government, freedom of the press and the individual. The 1840s had seen the emergence of radical liberal publications such as Rheinische Zeitung (1842); Le National and La R√©forme (1843) in France; Ignaz Kuranda's Grenzboten (1841) in Austria; Lajos Kossuth's Pesti H√≠rlap (1841) in Hungary, as well as the increased popularity of the older Morgenbladet in Norway and the Aftonbladet in Sweden.Sperber (1994) pp. 99, 113; Ginsborg, p. 44; 'Nationalism' believed in uniting people bound by (some mix of) common languages, culture, religion, shared history, and of course immediate geography; there were also irredentist movements. Nationalism had developed a broader appeal during the pre-1848 period, as seen in the Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω's 1836 History of the Czech Nation, which emphasised a national lineage of conflict with the Germans, or the popular patriotic Liederkranz (song-circles) that were held across Germany: patriotic and belligerent songs about Schleswig had dominated the W√ºrzburg national song festival in 1845.Stanley Z. Pech, The Czech Revolution of 1848 (1969), p. 25, Wolfram Siemann, The German Revolution of 1848‚Äì1849 (London, 1998), p. 47 'Socialism' in the 1840s was a term without a consensus definition, meaning different things to different people, but was typically used within a context of more power for workers in a system based on worker ownership of the means of production. These concepts together - democracy, liberalism, nationalism and socialism, in the sense described above - came to be encapsulated in the political term radicalism. Sequence of main trends  Every country had a distinctive timing, but the general pattern showed very sharp cycles as reform moved up then down.John Merriman, A History of Modern Europe (3rd ed. 2010) ch 16 pp 613‚Äì48 online. Spring 1848: Astonishing success The revolutionary barricades in Vienna in May 1848 The world was astonished in spring 1848 when revolutions appeared in so many places and seemed on the verge of success everywhere. Agitators who had been exiled by the old governments rushed home to seize the moment. In France the monarchy was overthrown and replaced by a republic. In a number of major German and Italian states, and in Austria, the old leaders were forced to grant liberal constitutions. The Italian and German states seemed to be rapidly forming unified nations. Austria gave Hungarians and Czechs liberal grants of autonomy and national status.Melvin Kranzberg, 1848: A Turning Point? (1962) p xi, xvii‚Äìxviii. Summer 1848: Divisions among reformers In France bloody street battles exploded between the middle class reformers and the working class radicals. German reformers argued endlessly without finalising their results.Kranzberg, 1848: A Turning Point? (1962) p xii, xvii‚Äìxviii. Autumn 1848: Reactionaries organize for a counter-revolution Caught off guard at first, the aristocracy and their allies plot a return to power. 1849‚Äì1851: Overthrow of revolutionary regimes The revolutions suffer a series of defeats in summer 1849. Reactionaries returned to power and many leaders of the revolution went into exile. Some social reforms proved permanent and years later nationalists in Germany, Italy, and Hungary gained their objectives.Kranzberg, 1848: A Turning Point? (1962) p xii, . Events by country or region=Italian states Episode from the Five Days of Milan, painting by Baldassare Verazzi Although little noticed at the time, the first major outbreak came in Sicily, starting in January 1848. There had been several previous revolts against Bourbon rule; this one produced an independent state that lasted only 16 months before the Bourbons came back. During those months, the constitution was quite advanced for its time in liberal democratic terms, as was the proposal of an Italian confederation of states. The revolt's failure was reversed 12 years later as the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies collapsed in 1860‚Äì61 with the Risorgimento. France The \\"February Revolution\\" in France was sparked by the suppression of the campagne des banquets. This revolution was driven by nationalist and republican ideals among the French general public, who believed the people should rule themselves. It ended the constitutional monarchy of Louis-Philippe, and led to the creation of the French Second Republic. This government was headed by Louis-Napoleon, Nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, who in 1852 staged a coup d'√©tat and established himself as a dictatorial emperor of the Second French Empire.William Roberts, Encyclopedia of Modern Dictators (2006) pp 209‚Äì211. Alexis de Tocqueville remarked in his Recollections of the period, \\"society was cut in two: those who had nothing united in common envy, and those who had anything united in common terror.\\"Tocqueville, Alexis de. \\"Recollections,\\" 1893 German states Revolutionaries in Berlin in March 1848, waving the revolutionary flags The \\"March Revolution\\" in the German states took place in the south and the west of Germany, with large popular assemblies and mass demonstrations. Led by well-educated students and intellectuals,Louis Namier, 1848: The Revolution of the Intellectuals (1964) they demanded German national unity, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly. The uprisings were poorly coordinated, but had in common a rejection of traditional, autocratic political structures in the 39 independent states of the German Confederation. The middle-class and working-class components of the Revolution split, and in the end, the conservative aristocracy defeated it, forcing many liberals into exile.Theodote S. Hamerow, Restoration, Revolution, Reaction: Economics and Politics in Germany, 1825‚Äì1870 (1958) focuses mainly on artisans and peasants Denmark Danish soldiers parade through Copenhagen in 1849 after victories in the First Schleswig War Denmark had been governed by a system of absolute monarchy since the 17th century. King Christian VIII, a moderate reformer but still an absolutist, died in January 1848 during a period of rising opposition from farmers and liberals. The demands for constitutional monarchy, led by the National Liberals, ended with a popular march to Christiansborg on 21 March. The new king, Frederick VII, met the liberals' demands and installed a new Cabinet that included prominent leaders of the National Liberal Party.Weibull, J√∂rgen. \\"Scandinavia, History of.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 15th ed., Vol. 16, 324. The national-liberal movement wanted to abolish absolutism, but retain a strongly centralized state. The king accepted a new constitution agreeing to share power with a bicameral parliament called the Rigsdag. It is said that the Danish king's first words after signing away his absolute power were, \\"that was nice, now I can sleep in the mornings\\".Olaf S√∏ndberg; den danske revolution 1830‚Äì1866: p. 70, line 47‚Äì48 Although army officers were dissatisfied, they accepted the new arrangement which, in contrast to the rest of Europe, was not overturned by reactionaries. The liberal constitution did not extend to Schleswig, leaving the Schleswig-Holstein Question unanswered. =Schleswig= The Duchy of Schleswig, a region containing both Danes (a North Germanic population) and Germans (a West Germanic population), was a part of the Danish monarchy, but remained a duchy separate from the Kingdom of Denmark. Spurred by pan-German sentiment, the Germans of Schleswig took up arms to protest a new policy announced by Denmark's National Liberal government, which would have fully integrated the duchy into Denmark. The German population in Schleswig and Holstein revolted, inspired by the Protestant clergy. The German states sent in an army, but Danish victories in 1849 led to the Treaty of Berlin (1850) and the London Protocol (1852). They reaffirmed the sovereignty of the King of Denmark, while prohibiting union with Denmark. The violation of the latter provision led to renewed warfare in 1863 and the Prussian victory in 1864. Habsburg Monarchy Proclamation of the Serbian Vojvodina in May 1848 From March 1848 through July 1849, the Habsburg Austrian Empire was threatened by revolutionary movements, which often had a nationalist character. The empire, ruled from Vienna, included Austrians, Hungarians, Slovenes, Poles, Czechs, Croats, Slovaks, Ukrainians/Ruthenians, Romanians, Serbs and Italians, all of whom attempted in the course of the revolution to achieve either autonomy, independence, or even hegemony over other nationalities. The nationalist picture was further complicated by the simultaneous events in the German states, which moved toward greater German national unity. =Hungary= Battle of Buda in May 1849 by M√≥r Than Hungarian hussars in battle during the Hungarian Revolution The Hungarian revolution of 1848 was the longest in Europe, crushed in August 1849 by Austrian and Russian armies. Nevertheless, it had a major effect in freeing the serfs.G√°bor G√°ng√≥, \\"1848‚Äì1849 in Hungary,\\" Hungarian Studies (2001) 15#1 pp. 39‚Äì47. online It started on 15 March 1848, when Hungarian patriots organized mass demonstrations in Pest and Buda (today Budapest) which forced the imperial governor to accept their 12 points of demands, which included the demand for freedom of press, an independent Hungarian ministry residing in Buda-Pest and responsible to a popularly elected parliament, the formation of a National Guard, complete civil and religious equality, trial by jury, a national bank, a Hungarian army, the withdrawal of foreign (Austrian) troops from Hungary, the freeing of political prisoners, and the union with Transylvania. On that morning, the demands were read aloud along with poetry by S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi with the simple lines of \\"We swear by the God of the Hungarians. We swear, we shall be slaves no more\\".Deak, Istvan. The Lawful Revolution. New York: Columbia University Press, 1979. Lajos Kossuth and some other liberal nobility that made up the Diet appealed to the Habsburg court with demands for representative government and civil liberties.\\"The US and the 1848 Hungarian Revolution.\\" The Hungarian Initiatives Foundation. Accessed 26 March 2015. http://www.hungaryfoundation.org/history/20140707_US_HUN_1848. These events resulted in Klemens von Metternich, the Austrian prince and foreign minister, resigning. The demands of the Diet were agreed upon on 18 March by Emperor Ferdinand. Although Hungary would remain part of the Empire through personal union with the emperor, a constitutional government would be founded. The Diet then passed the April laws that established equality before the law, a legislature, a hereditary constitutional monarchy, and an end to the transfer and restrictions of land use. The revolution grew into a war for independence from the Austrian Empire when Josip Jelaƒçiƒá, Ban of Croatia, crossed the border to restore Habsburg control.The Making of the West: Volume C, Lynn Hunt, pp. 683‚Äì84 The new government, led by Lajos Kossuth, was initially successful against the Habsburg forces. Although Hungary took a national united stand for its freedom, some minorities of the Kingdom of Hungary, including the Serbs of Vojvodina, the Romanians of Transylvania and some Slovaks of Upper Hungary supported the Habsburg Emperor and fought against the Hungarian Revolutionary Army. Eventually, after one and a half years of fighting, the revolution was crushed when Russian Tsar Nicholas I marched into Hungary with over 300,000 troops. With the Austrian government restored, Hungary was thus placed under brutal martial law. The leading rebels like Kossuth fled into exile or were executed. In the long run, the passive resistance following the revolution led to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise (1867), which marked the birth of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. =Galicia= The center of the Ukrainian national movement was in Galicia, which is today divided between Ukraine and Poland. On 19 April 1848, a group of representatives led by the Greek Catholic clergy launched a petition to the Austrian Emperor. It expressed wishes that in those regions of Galicia where the Ruthenian (Ukrainian) population represented majority, the Ukrainian language should be taught at schools and used to announce official decrees for the peasantry; local officials were expected to understand it and the Ruthenian clergy was to be equalized in their rights with the clergy of all other denominations.Kost' Levytskyi, The History of the Political Thought of the Galician Ukrainians, 1848‚Äì1914, (Lviv, 1926), 17. On 2 May 1848, the Supreme Ruthenian (Ukrainian) Council was established. The Council (1848‚Äì1851) was headed by the Greek-Catholic Bishop Gregory Yakhimovich and consisted of 30 permanent members. Its main goal was the administrative division of Galicia into Western (Polish) and Eastern (Ruthenian/Ukrainian) parts within the borders of the Habsburg Empire, and formation of a separate region with a political self-governance.Kost' Levytskyi, The History of the Political Thought of the Galician Ukrainians, 1848‚Äì1914, (Lviv, 1926), 26. Sweden During 18‚Äì19 March, a series of riots known as the March Unrest (Marsoroligheterna) took place in the Swedish capital of Stockholm. Declarations with demands of political reform were spread in the city and a crowd were dispersed by the military, leading to 18 casualties. Switzerland Switzerland, already an alliance of republics, also saw an internal struggle. The attempted secession of seven Catholic cantons to form an alliance known as the Sonderbund (\\"separate alliance\\") in 1845 led to a short civil conflict in November 1847 in which around 100 people were killed. The Sonderbund was decisively defeated by the Protestant cantons, which had a larger population.Joachim Remak, Very Civil War: The Swiss Sonderbund War of 1847 (1993) A new constitution of 1848 ended the almost-complete independence of the cantons, transforming Switzerland into a federal state. Greater Poland Polish people mounted a military insurrection against the Prussians in the Grand Duchy of Posen (or the Greater Poland region), a part of Prussia since its annexation in 1815. The Poles tried to establish a Polish political entity, but refused to cooperate with the Germans and the Jews. The Germans decided they were better off with the status quo, so they assisted the Prussian governments in recapturing control. In the long-term, the uprising stimulated nationalism among both the Poles and the Germans and brought civil equality to the Jews.Krzysztof Makowski, \\"Poles, Germans and Jews in the Grand Duchy of Poznan in 1848: From coexistence to conflict.\\" East European Quarterly 33.3 (1999): 385. Romanian Principalities Romanian revolutionaries in Bucharest in 1848, carrying the Romanian tricolor A Romanian liberal and Romantic nationalist uprising began in June in the principality of Wallachia. Its goals were administrative autonomy, abolition of serfdom, and popular self-determination. It was closely connected with the 1848 unsuccessful revolt in Moldavia, it sought to overturn the administration imposed by Imperial Russian authorities under the Regulamentul Organic regime, and, through many of its leaders, demanded the abolition of boyar privilege. Led by a group of young intellectuals and officers in the Wallachian military forces, the movement succeeded in toppling the ruling Prince Gheorghe Bibescu, whom it replaced with a provisional government and a regency, and in passing a series of major liberal reforms, first announced in the Proclamation of Islaz. Despite its rapid gains and popular backing, the new administration was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces, especially over the issue of land reform. Two successive abortive coups weakened the new government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats. In September 1848 by agreement with the Ottomans, Russia invaded and put down the revolution. According to Vasile Maciu, the failures were attributable in Wallachia to foreign intervention, in Moldavia to the opposition of the feudalists, and in Transylvania to the failure of the campaigns of General J√≥zef Bem, and later to Austrian repression.Vasile Maciu, \\"Le caract√®re unitaire de la r√©volution de 1848 dans les pays roumains.\\" Revue Roumaine d'Histoire 7 (1968): 679‚Äì707. In later decades, the rebels returned and gained their goals. Belgium A depiction of Leopold I of Belgium's symbolic offer to resign the crown in 1848 Belgium did not see major unrest in 1848; it had already undergone a liberal reform after the Revolution of 1830 and thus its constitutional system and its monarchy survived.Stefan Huygebaert, \\"Unshakeable Foundations,\\" Journal of Belgian History 45.4 (2015). A number of small local riots broke out, concentrated in the sillon industriel industrial region of the provinces of Li√®ge and Hainaut. The most serious threat of revolutionary contagion, however, was posed by Belgian √©migr√© groups from France. In 1830 the Belgian Revolution had broken out inspired by the revolution occurring in France, and Belgian authorities feared that a similar 'copycat' phenomenon might occur in 1848. Shortly after the revolution in France, Belgian migrant workers living in Paris were encouraged to return to Belgium to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. Belgian authorities expelled Karl Marx himself from Brussels in early March on accusations of having used part of his inheritance to arm Belgian revolutionaries. Around 6,000 armed √©migr√©s of the \\"Belgian Legion\\" attempted to cross the Belgian frontier. There were two divisions which were formed. The first group, travelling by train, were stopped and quickly disarmed at Qui√©vrain on 26 March 1848. The second group crossed the border on 29 March and headed for Brussels. They were confronted by Belgian troops at the hamlet of Risquons-Tout and defeated. Several smaller groups managed to infiltrate Belgium, but the reinforced Belgian border troops succeeded and the defeat at Risquons-Tout effectively ended the revolutionary threat to Belgium. The situation in Belgium began to recover that summer after a good harvest, and fresh elections returned a strong majority to the governing party. Ireland A tendency common in the revolutionary movements of 1848 was a perception that the liberal monarchies set up in the 1830s, despite formally being representative parliamentary democracies, were too oligarchical and/or corrupt to respond to the urgent needs of the people, and were therefore in need of drastic democratic overhaul or, failing that, separatism to build a democratic state from scratch. This was the process that occurred in Ireland between 1801 and 1848. Previously a separate kingdom, Ireland was incorporated into the United Kingdom in 1801. Although its population was made up largely of Catholics, and sociologically of agricultural workers, tensions arose from the political over-representation, in positions of power, of landowners of Protestant background who were loyal to the United Kingdom. From the 1810s a conservative-liberal movement led by Daniel O'Connell had sought to secure equal political rights for Catholics within the British political system, successful in the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. But as in other European states, a current inspired by Radicalism criticised the conservative-liberals for pursuing the aim of democratic equality with excessive compromise and gradualism. Trial of the Irish patriots at Clonmel. Young Irelanders receiving their sentence of death. In Ireland a current of nationalist, egalitarian and Radical republicanism, inspired by the French Revolution, had been present since the 1790s being expressed initially in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. This tendency grew into a movement for social, cultural and political reform during the 1830s, and in 1839 was realised into a political association called Young Ireland. It was initially not well received, but grew more popular with the Great Famine of 18451849, an event that brought catastrophic social effects and which threw into light the inadequate response of authorities. The spark for the Young Irelander Revolution came in 1848 when the British Parliament passed the \\"Crime and Outrage Bill\\". The Bill was essentially a declaration of martial law in Ireland, designed to create a counter-insurgency against the growing Irish nationalist movement.Woodham-Smith, Cecil The Great Hunger Ireland 1845 1849 Harper and Row New york pages 326‚Äì327 In response, the Young Ireland Party launched its rebellion in July 1848, gathering landlords and tenants to its cause. But its first major engagement against police, in the village of Ballingarry, South Tipperary, was a failure. A long gunfight with around 50 armed Royal Irish Constables ended when police reinforcements arrived. After the arrest of the Young Ireland leaders, the rebellion collapsed, though intermittent fighting continued for the next year, It is sometimes called the Famine Rebellion (since it took place during the Great Famine).  Spain  While no revolution occurred in Spain in the year 1848, a similar phenomenon occurred. During this year, the country was going through the Second Carlist War. The European revolutions erupted at a moment when the political regime in Spain faced great criticism from within one of its two main parties, and by 1854 a radical-liberal revolution and a conservative- liberal counter-revolution had both occurred. Since 1833, Spain had been governed by a conservative-liberal parliamentary monarchy similar to and modelled on the July Monarchy in France. In order to exclude absolute monarchists from government, power had alternated between two liberal parties: the centre-left Progressive Party, and the centre-right Moderate Party. But a decade of rule by the centre-right Moderates had recently produced a constitutional reform (1845), prompting fears that the Moderates sought to reach out to Absolutists and permanently exclude the Progressives. The left- wing of the Progressive Party, which had historical links to Jacobinism and Radicalism, began to push for root-and-branch reforms to the constitutional monarchy, notably universal male suffrage and parliamentary sovereignty. The European Revolutions of 1848 and particularly the French Second Republic prompted the Spanish radical movement to adopt positions incompatible with the existing constitutional regime, notably republicanism. This ultimately led the Radicals to exit the Progressive Party to form the Democratic Party in 1849. Over the next years, two revolutions occurred. In 1852, the conservatives of the Moderate Party were ousted after a decade in power by an alliance of Radicals, Liberals and liberal Conservatives led by Generals Espartero and O'Donnell. In 1854, the more conservative half of this alliance launched a second revolution to oust the republican Radicals, leading to a new 10-year period of government by conservative-liberal monarchists. Taken together, the two revolutions can be thought of as echoing aspects of the French Second Republic: the Spanish Revolution of 1852, as a revolt by Radicals and Liberals against the oligarchical, conservative-liberal parliamentary monarchy of the 1830s, mirrored the French Revolution of 1848; while the Spanish Revolution of 1854, as a counter-revolution of conservative-liberals under a military strongman, had echoes of Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte's coup against the French Second Republic. Other European states March troubles\\" in Stockholm, Sweden in 1848 The Island of Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, the Russian Empire (including Poland and Finland), and the Ottoman Empire did not encounter major national or Radical revolutions over this period. Sweden and Norway were also little affected. Serbia, though formally unaffected by the revolt as it was a part of the Ottoman state, actively supported Serbian revolutionaries in the Habsburg Empire. Russia's relative stability was attributed to the revolutionary groups' inability to communicate with each other. In some countries, uprisings had already occurred demanding similar reforms to the Revolutions of 1848, but little success. This was case for the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which had seen a series of uprisings before or after but not during 1848: the November Uprising of 1830‚Äì31; the Krak√≥w Uprising of 1846 (notable for being quelled by the anti-revolutionary Galician slaughter), and later on the January Uprising of 1863‚Äì65. In other countries, the relative calm could be attributed to the fact that they had already gone through revolutions or civil wars in the preceding years, and therefore already enjoyed many of the reforms which Radicals elsewhere were demanding in 1848. This was largely the case for Belgium (the Belgian Revolution in 1830‚Äì1); Portugal (the Liberal Wars of 1828‚Äì34); and Switzerland (the Sonderbund War of 1847) In yet other countries, the absence of unrest was partly due to governments taking action to prevent revolutionary unrest, and pre-emptively grant some of the reforms demanded by revolutionaries elsewhere. This was notably the case for the Netherlands, where King William II decided to alter the Dutch constitution to reform elections and voluntarily reduce the power of the monarchy. The same might be said of Switzerland, where a new constitutional regime was introduced in 1848: the Swiss Federal Constitution was a revolution of sorts, laying the foundation of Swiss society as it is today. While no major political upheavals occurred in the Ottoman Empire as such, political unrest did occur in some of its vassal states. In Serbia, feudalism was abolished and the power of the Serbian prince was reduced with the Turkish Constitution of Serbia in 1838. Other English-speaking countries Chartist meeting on Kennington Common 10 April 1848 In Britain, while the middle classes had been pacified by their inclusion in the extension of the franchise in the Reform Act 1832, the consequential agitations, violence, and petitions of the Chartist movement came to a head with their peaceful petition to Parliament of 1848. The repeal in 1846 of the protectionist agricultural tariffscalled the \\"Corn Laws\\"had defused some proletarian fervour. In the Isle of Man, there were ongoing efforts to reform the self-elected House of Keys, but no revolution took place. Some of the reformers were encouraged by events in France in particular. In the United States, opinions were polarized, with Democrats and reformers in favor, although they were distressed at the degree of violence involved. Opposition came from conservative elements, especially Whigs, southern slaveholders, orthodox Calvinists, and Catholics. About 4,000 German exiles arrived and some became fervent Republicans in the 1850s, such as Carl Schurz. Kossuth toured America and won great applause, but no volunteers or diplomatic or financial help.Timothy Mason Roberts, Distant Revolutions: 1848 and the Challenge to American Exceptionalism (2009) Following rebellions in 1837 and 1838, 1848 in Canada saw the establishment of responsible government in Nova Scotia and The Canadas, the first such governments in the British Empire outside Great Britain. John Ralston Saul has argued that this development is tied to the revolutions in Europe, but described the Canadian approach to the revolutionary year of 1848 as \\"talking their way...out of the empire's control system and into a new democratic model\\", a stable democratic system which has lasted to the present day.Saul, J.R. (2012). Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine & Robert Baldwin. Penguin Group (Canada). Tory and Orange Order in Canada opposition to responsible government came to a head in riots triggered by the Rebellion Losses Bill in 1849. They succeeded in the burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal, but, unlike their counterrevolutionary counterparts in Europe, they were ultimately unsuccessful. South America In Spanish Latin America, the Revolution of 1848 appeared in New Granada, where Colombian students, liberals, and intellectuals demanded the election of General Jos√© Hilario L√≥pez. He took power in 1849 and launched major reforms, abolishing slavery and the death penalty, and providing freedom of the press and of religion. The resulting turmoil in Colombia lasted three decades; from 1851 to 1885, the country was ravaged by four general civil wars and 50 local revolutions.J. Fred Rippy, Latin America: A Modern History (1958) pp. 253‚Äì54 In Chile, the 1848 revolutions inspired the 1851 Chilean Revolution. In Brazil, the \\"Praieira Revolt,\\" a movement in Pernambuco, lasted from November 1848 to 1852. Unresolved conflicts from the period of the regency and local resistance to the consolidation of the Brazilian Empire that had been proclaimed in 1822 helped to plant the seeds of the revolution. In Mexico, the conservative government led by Santa Anna lost Texas, California and half of the territory to the United States in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1845-48. Derived from this catastrophe and chronic stability problems, the Liberal Party started a reformist movement. This movement, via elections, led liberals to formulate the Plan of Ayutla. The Plan written in 1854 aimed at removing conservative, centralist President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna from control of Mexico during the Second Federal Republic of Mexico period. Initially, it seemed little different than other political plans of the era, but it is considered the first act of the Liberal Reform in Mexico.Robert J. Knowlton, \\"Plan of Ayutla\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 4, p. 420. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. It was the catalyst for revolts in many parts of Mexico, which led to the resignation of Santa Anna from the presidency, never to vie for office again.Erika Pani, \\"Revolution of Ayutla\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, vol. 1, p. 119. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997. The next Presidents of Mexico were the liberals, Juan √Ålvarez, Ignacio Comonfort, and Benito Ju√°rez. The new regime would then proclaim the 1857 Mexican Constitution, which implemented a variety of liberal reforms. Among other things, these reforms confiscated religious property, aimed to promote economic development and to stabilize a nascent republican government. Pani, Ibid. p. 120. The reforms led directly to the so-called Three Years War or Reform War of 1857. The liberals won this war but the conservatives solicited the French Government of Napoleon III for a European, conservative Monarch, deriving into the \\"Second French intervention in Mexico\\". Under the puppet Habsburg government of Maximilian I of Mexico, the country became a client state of France (1863-1867). Legacy Historian Priscilla Smith Robertson argues that many goals were achieved by the 1870s, but the credit primarily goes to the enemies of the 1848 revolutionaries: > Most of what the men of 1848 fought for was brought about within a quarter > of a century, and the men who accomplished it were most of them specific > enemies of the 1848 movement. Thiers ushered in a third French Republic, > Bismarck united Germany, and Cavour, Italy. De√°k won autonomy for Hungary > within a dual monarchy; a Russian czar freed the serfs; and the British > manufacturing classes moved toward the freedoms of the People's > Charter.Priscilla Smith Robertson quoted in Democrats looked to 1848 as a democratic revolution, which in the long run ensured liberty, equality, and fraternity. For nationalists, 1848 was the springtime of hope, when newly emerging nationalities rejected the old multinational empires. But the end results were not as comprehensive as many had hoped. A caricature by Ferdinand Schr√∂der on the defeat of the revolutions of 1848/49 in Europe (published in D√ºsseldorfer Monatshefte, August 1849) Many governments engaged in a partial reversal of the revolutionary reforms of 1848‚Äì1849, as well as heightened repression and censorship. The Hanoverian nobility successfully appealed to the Confederal Diet in 1851 over the loss of their noble privileges, while the Prussian Junkers recovered their manorial police powers from 1852 to 1855.Green, Abigail, Fatherlands: State-Building and Nationhood in Nineteenth-Century Germany (Cambridge, 2001), p. 75Barclay, David, Friedrich Wilhelm IV and the Prussian Monarchy 1840‚Äì1861 (Oxford, 1995), pp. 190, 231 In the Austrian Empire, the Sylvester Patents (1851) discarded Franz Stadion's constitution and the Statute of Basic Rights, while the number of arrests in Habsburg territories increased from 70,000 in 1850 to one million by 1854.Deak, John. Forging a Multinational State: State Making in Imperial Austria from the Enlightenment to the First World War (Stanford, 2015), p. 105 Nicholas I's rule in Russia after 1848 was particularly repressive, marked by an expansion of the secret police (the Tretiye Otdeleniye) and stricter censorship; there were more Russians working for censorship organs than actual books published in the period immediately after 1848.Westwood, J. N. Endurance and Endeavour: Russian History, 1812‚Äì1980. Oxford (2002), p. 32Goldfrank, David M. The Origins of the Crimean War. London: Longman, (1994), p. 21 In France, the works of Ledru-Rollin, Hugo, Baudelaire and Proudhon were confiscated.Price, Roger. The French Second Empire: An Anatomy of Political Power (Cambridge, 2001), p. 327. In the post- revolutionary decade after 1848, little had visibly changed, and many historians considered the revolutions a failure, given the seeming lack of permanent structural changes. More recently, Christopher Clark has characterised the period that followed 1848 as one dominated by a 'revolution in government'. Karl Marx expressed disappointment at the bourgeois character of the revolutions. The Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Manteuffel declared that the state could no longer be run 'like the landed estate of a nobleman'. In Prussia, August von Bethmann-Hollweg's Preu√üisches Wochenblatt newspaper (founded 1851) acted as a popular outlet for modernising Prussian conservative statesmen and journalists against the reactionary Kreuzzeitung faction. The revolutions of 1848 were followed by new centrist coalitions dominated by liberals nervous of the threat of working-class socialism, as seen in the Piedmontese Connubio under Cavour.Brophy, James M. Capitalism, Politics and Railroads in Prussia 1830‚Äì1870 (Columbus, 1998), p. 1Schroeder, Paul in Blanning, T. C. W. (ed.), The Short Oxford History of Europe: The Nineteenth Century (Oxford, 2000), p. 171Smith, Denis Mack. Cavour (Knopf, 1985), p. 91 Governments after 1848 were forced into managing the public sphere and popular sphere with more effectiveness, resulting in the increased prominence of the Prussian Zentralstelle f√ºr Pressangelegenheiten (Central Press Agency, established 1850), the Austrian Zensur-und polizeihofstelle, and the French Direction G√©n√©rale de la Librairie (1856).Clark, p. 184 Nevertheless, there were a few immediate successes for some revolutionary movements, notably in the Habsburg lands. Austria and Prussia eliminated feudalism by 1850, improving the lot of the peasants. European middle classes made political and economic gains over the next 20 years; France retained universal male suffrage. Russia would later free the serfs on 19 February 1861. The Habsburgs finally had to give the Hungarians more self-determination in the Ausgleich of 1867. The revolutions inspired lasting reform in Denmark, as well as the Netherlands. Reinhard R√ºrup has described the 1848 Revolutions as a turning point in the development of modern antisemitism through the development of conspiracies that presented Jews as representative both of the forces of social revolution (apparently typified in Joseph Goldmark and Adolf Fischhof of Vienna) and of international capital, as seen in the 1848 report from Eduard von M√ºller-Tellering, the Viennese correspondent of Marx's Neue Rheinische Zeitung, which declared: \\"tyranny comes from money and the money belongs to the Jews\\".\\"Progress and Its Limits: The Revolution of 1848 and European Jewry\\". Reinhard R√ºrup in Dowe, Dieter ed., Europe in 1848: Revolution and Reform (Oxford, 2001), pp. 758, 761 About 4,000 exiles came to the United States fleeing the reactionary purges. Of these, 100 went to the Texas Hill Country as German Texans. More widely, many disillusioned and persecuted revolutionaries, in particular (though not exclusively) those from Germany and the Austrian Empire, left their homelands for foreign exile in the New World or in the more liberal European nations: these emigrants were known as the Forty-Eighters.

Chamitataxus avitus is the only known species of the genus. Chamitataxus lived during the Late Miocene, around 6 million years ago in what is now North America. Out of the three taxideine badger genera to have existed on the continent, Chamitataxus is the most primitive. Very few taxideine badger remains have been uncovered to date, with only prehistoric Taxidea and Pliotaxidea specimens being discovered prior to the Chamitataxus holotype being found. Description Chamitataxus is known only from a single holotype found in 1935, which consists of a nearly complete skull. The holotype was discovered in a quarry not far from Lyden, New Mexico, where the prehistoric herbivore Osbornoceros was also discovered. Chamitataxus was named after the rock formation it was discovered in, the Chamita Formation. Due to the relative lack of Chamitataxus specimens, much of the research into the genus is based upon research into better-represented taxa related to Chamitataxus, such as Taxidea, the modern American badger, which also existed in the Late Miocene. Chamitataxus was fairly similar to its modern-day relatives in most respects; it was a carnivore and judging from the skull found, it looked fairly similar. However, because so little of Chamitataxus has been found, estimating its size and other features is impossible; much is unknown about the genus. Chamitataxus had a very good sense of smell and had a firm grip like its modern equivalent and this enabled Chamitataxus to kill burrowing animals with a bite to the neck. Like other mammals, Chamitataxus excelled at hearing low-frequency noises, which it could hear at a long distance. Overall, Chamitataxus was an expert hunter based on scientists' findings, and was able to prey on many different types of land- dwelling creatures during the Miocene.

The Uinta Basin (also known as the Uintah Basin) is a physiographic section of the larger Colorado Plateaus province, which in turn is part of the larger Intermontane Plateaus physiographic division. It is also a geologic structural basin in eastern Utah, east of the Wasatch Mountains and south of the Uinta Mountains. The Uinta Basin is fed by creeks and rivers flowing south from the Uinta Mountains. Many of the principal rivers (Strawberry River, Currant Creek, Rock Creek, Lake Fork River, and Uintah River) flow into the Duchesne River which feeds the Green River--a tributary of the Colorado River. The Uinta Mountains forms the northern border of the Uinta Basin. They contain the highest point in Utah, Kings Peak, with a summit 13,528 feet (4123 metres) above sea level.

Other communities in the Utah part of the region include Duchesne, Roosevelt, Altamont, Tabiona, and a number of small unincorporated communities. The Uinta Basin is also the location of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation, home to the Ute Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Agency (also known as the Northern Ute Tribe). The Ute Tribe is the source of Utah's state name. Local attractions include Dinosaur National Monument, Starvation Reservoir State Park, Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area, Raven Ridge and Fantasy Canyon. The local economy, once based on agriculture and mining, has diversified, and energy extraction and tourism are now major industries as well. In order to move oil out of the region, a new railroad is proposed to be constructed into the basin. In addition, Utah State University operates Branch campuses at Vernal and Roosevelt, expanding educational opportunities in a previously underserved region of Utah. Physiography The Uinta Basin is the most northerly section of the Colorado Plateau sections. The basin is above sea level and corresponding to this depression is a broad east-west strip of higher plateau that rises sharply above the denuded country to the south. On the south side of the plateau the descent of , to the general level of eastern Utah on the south, is made in two steps. The first is the Roan Cliffs and the second, the Book Cliffs. Eastward in Colorado the two lines of cliffs are poorly distinguished. The Green River flows southward out of the Uinta Mountains to the north, crossing the Uinta Basin, and flows in a deep gorge known as Desolation Canyon. The Colorado River crosses the eastern portion of this section, cutting off an area of some 40 miles (64 kilometres) in diameter in which are preserved fragments of a lofty lava cap forming Grand Mesa and Battlement Mesa. Geology The Uinta Basin forms a geologic structural basin, and is the source of commercial oil and gas production. Separated from the Piceance Basin by the Douglas Creek Arch, both basins formed during the Laramide Orogeny, and are bounded by the Charleston-Nebo thrust fault, the Uinta Basin boundary fault, and the Grand Hogback monocline. The Uinta Basin includes the Wasatch Plateau. According to the USGS Uinta-Piceance Assessment Team, \\"The black-shale facies of the Green River Formation is the main petroleum system of Tertiary age whereas the Mahogany zone of the Green River Formation is a minor component. The Cretaceous Mancos Group and equivalent rocks are the main source of Cretaceous oil and a major contributor of gas in the basin, whereas the Upper Cretaceous Mesaverde is a lesser contributor of oil but a significant source for gas. Ferron Sandstone coals are known to be a source of coalbed methane. The most prominent source of oil from Paleozoic rocks is the Permian Phosphoria Formation. During the Laramide Orogeny along the Wasatch Mountains, the north- south trending coast during the Late Cretaceous was receding eastward, at the same time the area where the basin is located was subsiding, creating a lacustrine environment. A clastic wedge consisting of the North Horn, Colton, and Wasatch was deposited northwards. These sediments interfingered with organic-rich lacustrine clays and carbonate muds of the Green River and Flagstaff facies. Later, deposits originated from the Uinta Mountains from the north, forming a southward-thinning clastic wedge. A carbonate sediment consisting of an organic-rich oil shale was deposited from the middle Eocene into the Oligocene. The basin is also known for solid-hydrocarbon-filled fractures consisting of ozocerite, gilsonite, and wurtzilite. In 1948, oil was discovered in the Paleozoic portion of the basin at Ashley Valley. Tertiary discoveries followed in 1948 at Roosevelt, and then the Red Wash Field and Duchesne Field in 1951. The Bluebell Field was discovered in 1967 and the Altamont Field in 1970. The Altamont-Bluebell structural trap occurs where the Wasatch sandstone pinches out. See also * Billie Untermann ReferencesExternal links * Utah -- Place.

Preston North End is an English football club in Preston, Lancashire which traces its origins to a local cricket club formed c.1863. This club moved to Deepdale in January 1875. They started playing football as a winter activity in 1878 and, in May 1880, took the decision to focus on football. Progress was rapid and the club became professional in 1883. They were a founder member of the Football League in 1888 and won the first two league championships in 1888‚Äì89 and 1889‚Äì90. Their team in 1888‚Äì89 also won the FA Cup and so became the first to achieve \\"The Double\\" in English football. In addition, the team was unbeaten in all first-class matches played that season and are famously remembered as \\"The Old Invincibles\\". Preston have had a chequered existence since 1890 and have won only one more major trophy, the 1937‚Äì38 FA Cup, when Bill Shankly was a key member of the team. Preston's greatest player was Tom Finney who joined the club as a teenager in 1938. His first team debut was delayed until 1946 by the Second World War but he played for Preston until he retired in 1960. He made 76 international appearances from 1946 to 1958 and is remembered as one of football's greatest-ever players. A year after Finney retired, Preston were relegated to the Second Division and, since then, have not yet returned to top flight English football. Preston had a memorable season in 1963‚Äì64 when, managed by former player Jimmy Milne, they reached the 1964 FA Cup Final and finished third in the Second Division. They were first relegated to the Third Division after the 1969‚Äì70 season. Although they won promotion again immediately, the team have spent 28 of the 49 seasons since 1970 in the bottom two divisions, including a span of nineteen seasons from 1981‚Äì82 to 1999‚Äì2000. The club experienced a near-terminal decline in the 1980s which brought about the very real threat of closure, the nadir being the 1985‚Äì86 season when they finished 23rd in the Fourth Division and had to seek re-election to the league. They recovered and won promotion back to the Third Division only a year later but it was a false dawn as the team spent another three years in the bottom division from 1993 to 1996. The club finally began to recover and move forward after a takeover by BAXI in 1994 but their ownership ended in June 2002. The team was established at second tier level through the 2000s but more problems arose at the end of the decade with an Inland Revenue winding-up order in 2010 and relegation to the third tier in 2011. The taxation issue was resolved by local businessman Trevor Hemmings, already a shareholder, who bought a controlling interest in June 2010. The team were promoted again in 2015 and have been well-placed in the EFL Championship since then. Deepdale has been a football venue from 1878 and is the world's oldest football ground in terms of continuous use by a club in a major league. When BAXI took control, they embarked on an investment programme which had the main goal of upgrading Deepdale into a modern stadium. The old ground was demolished and rebuilt in four stages and the last of the new stands was opened in 2008. Part of the redevelopment was the original National Football Museum which opened at Deepdale in 2001, though it closed in 2010 due to funding issues and was relocated to Manchester in 2012. Early days (1863 to 1886)=Origin as a cricket team The club's origin has been traced to a cricket team that was founded c.1863 in Preston and was linked to the Wellfield Road School. At first, this team played on a strip of land called \\"The Marsh\\", on the Ribble Estuary at Ashton-on-Ribble, which is now a suburb in the western part of the town. In 1863, some team members proposed a move to Moor Park, where Preston Corporation had opened new playing fields. This caused a split but those in favour of the move went anyway and formed Preston North End Cricket Club, so called because Moor Park is on the north side of town. The first club president was George Howarth. On 3 August 1867, William Sudell, then aged sixteen, became a member. Foundation of the football club The club had ongoing financial difficulties but managed to keep going and, in spite of their problems, decided on 21 January 1875 to take lease on a field at Deepdale Farm. Partly to try and earn extra income and partly to have a fitness activity through the winter months, the club formed a rugby team in 1877‚Äì78. This was not a success and they turned to association football in 1878‚Äì79. Their earliest known match took place on 5 October 1878 against Eagley F.C. and Preston lost 0‚Äì1. It was played at Deepdale which has thus become the world's oldest football ground in continuous use by a major league club (the second oldest is Turf Moor, first used by Burnley on 17 February 1883). Preston's team in the match against Eagley was: W. Sudell, W. Turner, J. Sefton, T. Charnley, T. Wadeson, J. Wadeson, C. Miller, T. Parkinson, J. F. Dodgson, R. Green and H. S. Carmel (captain). In May 1880, aware of the success of other Lancashire football teams, team captain Harry Carmel proposed the formal establishment of the football club. Support was unanimous. The new club is known to have played ten games in the 1880‚Äì81 season, including one on 26 March 1881 against Blackburn Rovers in which Preston were beaten 10‚Äì0. The club continued to play cricket in summer but the members were in no doubt that football was the club's future. Professionalism (1881‚Äì1886) Over the next few years, Deepdale gradually improved its facilities and increased in size. Football had become a major attraction in the town and Sudell, who was now the man at the helm of the club, had a vision of how to make Preston North End the best team in England. Sudell's plan was to 'import' top players from other areas, primarily Scotland - which provided talent for many English clubs of the time in the form of the Scotch Professors. The identity of the club's first Scottish player was James McDade who \\"turned up in Preston and began to educate the locals\\".https://www.nutmegmagazine.co.uk/issue-4/the-scottish-professors-and- their-role-in-footballs-first-invincibles/ He travelled South from the Neilston area of Glasgow and was living in Preston in 1881. At the outset he was one of the club's best players, he turned out in the team against Astley Bridge in November 1880 and was a member of the team through 1881 and 1882. Since he was coming to the end of his career his main influence was as North End's first coach and strategist. Other Scots were to follow and they were to be rewarded by being paid match fees and being 'accommodated' with highly paid work in the Preston area, a practice which was not uncommon among the Lancashire clubs. This led to accusations of professionalism from Preston's rivals. In 1884 for instance, Upton Park, who arrived at Deepdale for a FA Cup tie, complained to the Football Association that their opponents had fielded a team packed with Scottish professionals. North End withdrew from the tournament, but a threat from thirty-six northern teams to break away and form a rival football association forced the FA to legalise professionalism in 1885. Halcyon days (1886 to 1893)=1886 to 1888 This period saw the development and supremacy of a team that became famous as \\"The Old Invincibles\\". The players were mostly recruited from north of the border as was the case with Nick Ross, his younger brother Jimmy Ross, David Russell, John Goodall and Geordie Drummond. There were some local players, such as full back Bob Holmes and winger Fred Dewhurst. During this time, Preston beat Hyde 26‚Äì0 in the first round of the FA Cup in 1887‚Äì88, which to this day remains an English first-class football record. They played Hibernian F.C. in 1887 World Championship losing 2‚Äì1 in Edinburgh. Champions (1888‚Äì90) The team pictured in March 1888. The Football League was founded in 1888; North End were one of the founder members and went on to make history. In the League's first season (1888‚Äì89), North End were inaugural league champions, achieving the feat without losing a match. On top of this, they completed the league and cup 'Double', winning the FA Cup without conceding a single goal, defeating Wolverhampton Wanderers 3‚Äì0 in the final. Preston were the first club to achieve the league and cup \\"Double\\" and they did so with a majority of their team being made up of \\"Scotch Professors\\" - as the professional Scottish players of the time were known. https://www.nutmegmagazine.co.uk/issue-4/the- scottish-professors-and-their-role-in-footballs-first-invincibles/ In 1889‚Äì90 Sudell's team repeated the feat in the League, but it wasn't long before rival teams improved. Despite many close calls, North End would never match The Old Invincibles' feat by winning the Football League Championship again. 1890 to 1893 Despite the Old Invincibles team being gradually dismantled, Preston continued to perform well in the league, finishing runners-up first to Everton and then twice in succession to Sunderland. In 1892‚Äì93 a second division was initiated, along with the first ever promotion/relegation 'play- off' system. This meant that the top three in Division Two would each play a one-off 'test match' against a team finishing in the bottom three in the top flight. In the 1892‚Äì93 FA Cup, Preston reached the semi-finals and were drawn against Everton, the tie to be played at Bramall Lane. It was a 2‚Äì2 draw and a replay was necessary. This took place at Ewood Park and was goalless. A second replay was arranged at Trent Bridge and this time Preston lost 1‚Äì2. 1893 to 1904=First Division (1893‚Äì1901) In 1893‚Äì94 Preston plummeted down the league to finish third from bottom (14th), requiring them to beat Notts County in the end-of-season test match to retain their top-flight status. This they did, defeating the Magpies 4‚Äì0 at Deepdale. This era saw the transfer of some of the club's better players. Nick Ross signed for Everton, John Goodall went to Derby County and Thomson to Wolves. However, two more significant events were rather more tragic for the club. First, in 1893 William Sudell lost his control of the club and it was established as a limited liability company. Then two of the Old Invincibles died at early ages. Firstly, Nick Ross, who had returned to Deepdale from Everton after only one year, succumbed to Tuberculosis. Then, Fred Dewhurst died. Second Division (1901‚Äì1904) North End were finally relegated in 1901. They were Second Division champions in 1903‚Äì04 and gained promotion back to the top flight. 1904 to 1915 Deepdale was enlarged to accommodate larger attendances as football nationwide increased in popularity. Among Preston's players at this time were centre-half Joe McCall, Peter McBride (who is second only to Alan Kelly Sr. in the list of North End's record league appearance makers with 443) and winger Dickie Bond. 1904‚Äì06 Preston finished as runners-up to Liverpool in 1905‚Äì06. 1906‚Äì11 Preston dropped down the First Division table and their best performance in this period was finishing tenth in 1908‚Äì09. \\"Yo-yo\\" seasons (1911‚Äì15) Preston were relegated in 1911‚Äì12 but immediately bounced back by winning the Second Division championship for the second time in 1912‚Äì13. They were still not good enough for the First Division and were immediately re- relegated in 1913‚Äì14. Despite the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the 1914‚Äì15 season was completed and Preston finished second to regain immediate promotion but it would be more than four years before they could return to the First Division. The onset of war eventually brought a halt to British football in the country and many players enlisted in the armed forces. A Footballers' Battalion was formed in December 1914 and grounds were used as volunteering points. 1919 to 1930=Division One (1919‚Äì25) Despite the fact that several regional competitions ran during the First World War, it was not until September 1919 that English league football returned. North End struggled for the most part of the inter-war period, with the club finishing first 19th and then 16th for three consecutive seasons before finally being relegated in 1924‚Äì25. Relegation coincided with the man who had been at the helm of the club, James Isherwood Taylor, being banned from the club by the FA after he had made illegal approaches for players, although he returned in 1925. Taylor arrived on the board in 1912, and became an increasingly influential figurehead at Deepdale, at a time when many other clubs were beginning to employ specialist team managers. Division Two (1925‚Äì30) Despite lean times in the league, North End very nearly experienced glory in the FA Cup. After reaching the semi-finals in 1921, they went one better a year later by qualifying to face Huddersfield Town in the final at Stamford Bridge - the last one before the opening of Wembley Stadium. In a poor game, Billy Smith was felled on the edge of the North End box, and despite fierce protests, the referee signalled for a spot-kick. Smith converted, despite the best efforts of bespectacled goalkeeper J.F. Mitchell to put him off by jumping up and down on his line. The cup was lost. Unlike before the war, North End found it extremely difficult to bounce back to the top flight. In their first season in League Division Two they finished 12th, followed by 6th, 4th, 13th and 16th in 1929‚Äì30. 1930 to 1939=Division Two (1930‚Äì34) It was not until 1934 that Preston finally returned to Division One, finishing runners-up behind Grimsby Town in 1933‚Äì34. This was Bill Shankly's first season after being signed from Carlisle United in May 1933. At many points during the club's nine seasons in Division Two, relegation seemed quite likely. However, Taylor averted this potential disaster by signing two forwards from Tottenham Hotspur in the shape of Ted Harper and Dick Rowley in the winter of 1931. In 1932‚Äì33, Harper scored 37 goals, a club record which still stands. During this period, Taylor also made some notable improvements to the ground. The Pavilion Stand was opened in 1934, housing offices, dressing rooms, boardroom and guest rooms. Division One (1934‚Äì39) On the pitch, the policy of signing players from north of the border continued. Jimmy Milne and Shankly would both prove great servants to the club. With this new injection of talent, Preston once again began to prosper - performing admirably in the First Division and reaching the FA Cup final in 1938. FA Cup (1937‚Äì38) Again, the opponents were Huddersfield Town, with the outcome again decided by a penalty, George Mutch firing into the roof of the net after being unfairly challenged by Terriers defender Alf Young in the last minute of extra time. This was the last time North End won a major domestic trophy. The Tom Finney era (1946 to 1961) =First Division (1946‚Äì1949) Although football continued through the war, Tom Finney was 24 years old when he made his official league debut for North End. However, many of the older Lilywhites' players had retired, having been deprived of eight years of their careers. Three North End players, Jack Owen, Percival Taylor and David Willacy were killed during the war. Second Division (1949‚Äì1951) Despite the setback of relegation in 1949, they bounced back within two seasons, setting themselves up for a prosperous time in the 1950s. However, they failed to win any further major domestic honours despite coming close on several occasions. First Division (1951‚Äì1956) Much is made of Finney's unstinting loyalty to the club and town, but in 1952 North End came agonisingly close to losing their greatest- ever player. English players moving to play abroad had hitherto been unheard of, but the decision of England international Neil Franklin to sign for Bogot√° in Colombia in 1950 suggested that First Division stars were indeed attainable. With this in mind, the Italian club Palermo offered Finney a signing on fee of ¬£10,000, a basic salary of ¬£130 per month, bonuses, a villa and a car. The signing on fee alone represented around ten years of earnings in English football. Finney urged the board to consider allowing him to speak to them, but his request was rejected. Despite this, Finney continued to play for the club, and the following year he almost reaped his reward. With two games remaining of the 1952/53 season, North End were locked in a three-way title battle with Arsenal and Wolves. As Wolves lost form at the crucial moment, Preston defeated the Gunners 2‚Äì0 at Deepdale. After another win over Derby County in midweek, it all came down to Arsenal's match against Burnley on the Friday. Arsenal won 3‚Äì2, pipping the Lilywhites to the First Division championship by a slender 0.1 of a goal. A devastated North End managed to bounce back the following season, however. Despite finishing eleventh in the league, they reached the FA Cup final, where they would face West Bromwich Albion. and lost 3‚Äì2. At one stage in the Wembley showpiece, North End led 2‚Äì1 thanks to goals from Angus Morrison and Charlie Wayman. A penalty conceded by Tommy Docherty and a late goal from Frank Griffin who slipped the ball under goalkeeper George Thompson turned the game, and for the second time in two seasons Preston were English football's nearly men. Cliff Britton, manager (1956‚Äì1961) For the rest of the decade, the Tom Finney-inspired outfit entertained crowds up and down the country with fast, attacking football. In 1960, with injuries beginning to get the better of him, Finney made the decision to retire. He played his last game in front of almost 30,000 supporters after a 2‚Äì0 victory over Luton Town. Fears that the end of Finney's playing career would prompt a downturn in the club's fortunes proved justified when they were relegated the following season. Britton resigned. Preston North End have not yet returned to the top flight of English football. 1961 to 1970=Jimmy Milne, manager (1961‚Äì1968) As Dave Russell points out in his book Preston North End: 100 Years in the Football League, one event took place in this period which would make it virtually impossible for North End to find the wages to compete with the elite in attracting top players. In 1960, the PFA, led by Jimmy Hill voted overwhelmingly to go on strike in an attempt to see the abolition of the maximum wage. When the Football League finally relented, wages increased greatly, and young players developed by the smaller clubs as a way around this difficulty were lured away or sold in order to reduce debts. However, North End still managed to reach the FA Cup Final in 1964. Their opponents this time were to be West Ham United, who contained future World Cup winners Bobby Moore and Geoff Hurst. Considering the Lilywhites' Second Division status, they started the game as clear underdogs. Despite this, and containing the youngest player in FA Cup Final history in seventeen-year-old Howard Kendall, Jimmy Milne's side looked the likely winners for long periods, taking the lead twice through Doug Holden and Alex Dawson. However West Ham proved too strong in the end and a last-minute winner by Ronnie Boyce saw the Londoners home 3‚Äì2. Bobby Seith, manager (1968‚Äì1970) Following the cup final defeat, the sales of Kendall, Dawson and Dave Wilson saw the club relegated to the Third Division for the first time in its history in 1970 after a defeat by local rivals Blackpool, who in the process confirmed their own promotion. 1970 to 1981=Alan Ball, manager (1970‚Äì1973) New manager Alan Ball senior ensured that North End bounced straight back up as champions. Promotion was secured after Easter with a Ricky Heppolette goal in a 1‚Äì0 victory over the then-leaders Fulham. Preston struggled in the Second Division and narrowly avoided relegation in both 1972 and 1973. Ball left in 1973 and was succeeded by Bobby Charlton. Bobby Charlton, manager (1973‚Äì1975) The club was relegated under Bobby Charlton in 1973‚Äì74 and finished ninth in 1974‚Äì75. Charlton then resigned in protest over the sale of John Bird to Newcastle United Harry Catterick, manager (1975‚Äì1977) Harry Catterick, the former Everton manager, took over for two seasons in which the team finished eighth and sixth. In the first round of the 1977 FA Cup, Preston needed two replays to dispose of Crewe Alexandra. The original tie at Gresty Road was drawn 1‚Äì1 and the first replay at Deepdale 2‚Äì2. The decider was held at Anfield and Preston won 3‚Äì0. It was all to no avail as they lost 1‚Äì0 to Halifax Town at The Shay in the second round. Nobby Stiles, manager (1977‚Äì1981) Promotion was won under Nobby Stiles in 1977‚Äì78, inspired by the likes of goalkeeper Roy Tunks, defender Mick Baxter, midfielder Gordon Coleman and the dynamic strike force of Alex Bruce and Mike Elwiss. At the same time the emerging Michael Robinson was sold for a club record fee of ¬£765,000 to Manchester City, whilst Alan Spavin retired. In 1980‚Äì81, Preston were relegated back to the Third Division in 20th place (on goal difference). Many players left the club along with manager Stiles after the end of the season, new manager Tommy Docherty making wholesale changes. These were not for the better and the events of the early 1980s would take the club perilously close to destruction. Hard times (1981 to 1995)=Third Division (1981‚Äì1985) Docherty's short spell in charge ended when he was sacked in early December 1981 after leading his side to just three wins in 17 league games. Docherty had brought in a clutch of players including Tommy Booth and Gary Buckley from Manchester City, Jonathan Clark from Derby County and John Kelly from Tranmere Rovers. A 4‚Äì1 FA Cup defeat at Chesterfield saw 'The Doc' replaced by Alan Kelly (on a caretaker basis), before former Everton boss Gordon Lee joined in December 1981. Lee improved the team's results, avoiding a catastrophic drop to the basement division by a considerable margin. Amongst the players the manager brought in was loan goalkeeper Martin Hodge. The next season, 1982‚Äì83, started with a Steve Elliott hat-trick defeating Millwall 3‚Äì2. However, North End's form soon collapsed, leaving them in danger of relegation, until a run of 9 wins from their last 13 games catapulted them into 16th position. Following this Alan Kelly again took charge, but the sale of star striker Elliott left the side short of goals, whilst conceding numerous goals. 1984‚Äì85 saw North End relegated, shipping exactly 100 goals. The side's top league goalscorer was John Kelly with a paltry seven. Fourth Division and re-election (1985‚Äì86) North End's first ever season in Division Four saw further reverses for the club. Tommy Booth had taken over from Kelly during the latter stages of the previous season, bringing former Manchester United player Brian Kidd in as his assistant. Despite an impressive 4‚Äì0 win over Torquay United in September, things gradually degenerated, culminating in a 7‚Äì3 cup defeat at the hands of Walsall. Booth soon resigned and Kidd took the reins, but things failed to improve. His record was one win in 17 matches when he too resigned, leaving midfielder Jonathan Clark in charge. He won five games on the trot in March 1986, but by then it was too late. North End had hit the depths, finishing 23rd and being forced to apply for re-election. After a successful re-election hearing it was all change at Deepdale the following year, with a new synthetic surface being laid in an attempt to bring extra revenue into the club. John McGrath, manager (1986‚Äì1990) The plan seemed to work, as North End, under new manager John McGrath, stormed to promotion in 1986‚Äì87 after finishing second in Division Four behind Northampton Town. The team's home form was superb as the opposition appeared to find it difficult to adapt to the new pitch, and McGrath's new recruits, journeymen such as Sam Allardyce, Oshor Williams, Gary Swann, Ronnie Hildersley and Les Chapman made them an extremely hard team to beat. In addition, the club reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, defeating Bury, Chorley and Middlesbrough before succumbing to Newcastle United. Promotion was achieved with four matches to spare, Chapman's winning goal at Orient securing a return to Division Three. John Thomas finished as top scorer with 21 league goals, aided superbly by Gary Brazil. The next season, 1987‚Äì88, was one of consolidation, McGrath bringing in new boys Tony Ellis and Brian Mooney. 1988‚Äì89 almost saw a return to Division Two, as North End finished 6th, only to lose 4‚Äì2 to Port Vale in the two-legged play-off semi-final. Unfortunately, the manager who had resuscitated the club began to struggle and a 2‚Äì0 FA Cup reverse at non-league side Whitley Bay proved to be the final straw in February 1990. Les Chapman, manager (1990‚Äì1992) His successor Les Chapman was appointed on 17 February 1990 and the team managed to avoid relegation, finishing nineteenth. Chapman was not helped by the perennial problems of a lack of funds and the sale of more first-team players including Ellis, Mooney and Ian Bogie. As a result, he struggled to move the team forward and Preston's mediocre league form continued through the next two seasons, eventually leading to his dismissal on 29 September 1992. The team finished seventeenth in both 1990‚Äì91 and 1991‚Äì92. John Beck and Gary Peters (1992‚Äì1995) The board chose to appoint John Beck as manager on 7 December 1992 and he brought in Gary Peters as his assistant. Beck made wholesale changes which included laying generous amounts of sand onto the flanks of the plastic pitch. The team at one stage looked to be safe from relegation but a disastrous run of five successive defeats took the club back into the fourth tier, now called League Three. Beck's long-ball tactics were controversial. Even so, the team finished fifth in 1993‚Äì94 and reached the League Three play- off final at Wembley, but they lost 4‚Äì2 to Martin O'Neill's Wycombe Wanderers. In the summer of 1994, the plastic pitch was removed by order of the Football League and the club was taken over by BAXI, producers of heating systems, who have a large manufacturing and testing facility in Preston. BAXI's chief executive Bryan Gray became club chairman. One of the first announcements by the new board was that Deepdale, until then a dilapidated stadium owned by Preston Council, would be upgraded into a modern stadium. This was made possible by the injection of extra funds by BAXI and from a subsequent new share issue. Work began the following year with the demolition of the old West Stand which stood on the Deepdale Road side of the ground. It was replaced by the Sir Tom Finney Stand at a cost of over ¬£4 million. In Preston's first game back on grass, they defeated Lincoln City 4‚Äì0. Despite early promise, a run of seven successive league losses saw the fans turn against the manager and, on 1 December 1994, Beck stepped down to make way for Peters, who implemented a passing game and turned things around so that the team again finished in fifth place. Peters was aided by the young David Beckham, who joined the club from Manchester United on a month-long loan spell and scored two goals in his five appearances. In the 1995 play-offs, Preston lost 2‚Äì0 on aggregate to Bury in the semi-final. Out of the fourth tier (1995‚Äì1997) Andy Saville, a much- travelled striker, was signed from Birmingham City for ¬£100,000, whilst Steve Wilkinson was acquired for ¬£80,000 from Mansfield Town to partner him. Despite losing their first game of the 1995‚Äì96 season 2‚Äì1 at home to Lincoln City, North End then embarked on a 21-match unbeaten run, which included a 6‚Äì0 drubbing of Mansfield, in which Saville and Wilkinson each bagged a hat-trick. In all, Saville finished the 1995‚Äì96 season with 29 league goals with Wilkinson and midfielder Simon Davey notching ten apiece. The Third Division championship was secured in late April with a 2‚Äì0 win at Hartlepool. The brand new 8,000 seater Tom Finney Stand was opened for the visit of Darlington on 16 March 1996. Gary Peters kept faith with the majority of his promotion winning outfit, reinforcing his squad at various stages of the following season with players who would be crucial to the club's success in subsequent campaigns. Mark Rankine joined from Wolves, Sean Gregan from Darlington for ¬£350,000 and Michael Jackson from Bury. Slowly the team that had got North End promoted were moved on, as the club looked to build for the future. David Moyes, manager (1998‚Äì2002) In 1997‚Äì98, a very inconsistent period of form saw the club move Peters to a new position as Director as the Centre of Excellence and replace him with assistant manager David Moyes, who was formally appointed on 12 January 1998. Moyes, who had been an excellent servant at centre-half for the previous few seasons, immediately injected a new zest into his side and the club eventually finished in 15th position, nine points above the relegation zone. Meanwhile, work on Deepdale was continuing and the Bill Shankly Kop was opened in 1998 at the Blackpool Road (north) end of the ground. The next stage was demolition of the old Town End terrace, behind the goal at the south end, to be replaced by the Alan Kelly Town End stand, which opened in 2001. In 1998‚Äì99, Preston came close to promotion but injuries to key players towards the end of the campaign saw them defeated in the play-offs by a determined Gillingham side. 1998‚Äì99 also saw the club lose out in an epic Deepdale FA Cup tie at home to Arsenal in the third round. Kurt Nogan scored two first-half goals, until the Gunners fought back (aided by a sending-off for David Eyres) to win 4‚Äì2. In 2000, Preston North End finally made their return to the second tier of the Football League, after an absence of nineteen seasons. Jon Macken, whom Gary Peters had signed from Manchester United two years previously, had a storming season scoring 22 league goals, his flair being reinforced by the team's solid spine of Teuvo Moilanen in goal, defenders Graham Alexander, Colin Murdock, Michael Jackson and Rob Edwards and a central midfield made up of workhorses Gregan and Rankine. The championship was confirmed at Cambridge on 24 April, a game which brought North End's seventh, and last, defeat of the season. In January 2001, Preston beat their club transfer record by paying ¬£1.5 million to Manchester United for David Healy. The team finished the 2000‚Äì01 season in fourth place, but again failed in the play-offs with a 3‚Äì0 defeat by Bolton Wanderers in the final at the Millennium Stadium. Preston had earlier beaten Birmingham City in the semi- final by winning a penalty shoot-out at Deepdale after the tie ended in a 2‚Äì2 aggregate draw. Bryan Gray resigned as chairman in the autumn of 2001 and BAXI declined to appoint a replacement, so it was clear that they intended to sell their holding in the club. Club director Derek Shaw, a local businessman, took over as acting chairman. Meanwhile, the collapse of ITV Digital cost the club an income of ¬£4.6 million over the next two years, which meant that planning for the Invincibles Pavilion on the east side of Deepdale had to be postponed (the stand was finally opened in 2008). David Moyes left the club on 14 March 2002 to become manager of Everton and was replaced by Craig Brown just before the 2001‚Äì02 season ended, Preston finishing in eighth place. 2002 to 2008 In June 2002, BAXI's involvement ceased when Derek Shaw and sponsor Steve Jackson combined to buy the firm's 26% shareholding and increase their stake to 28%. A few days earlier, future club owner Trevor Hemmings had increased his share to 12%. The other main shareholder was fund management group Ivory and Sime UK, which owned 25.88%. Craig Brown was the team manager for the next two seasons, the team finishing twelfth in 2002‚Äì03 and fifteenth in 2003‚Äì04. The second tier Football League One was re-branded in summer 2004 as the Football League Championship. After a poor start to the 2004‚Äì05 Championship season, Brown left by mutual consent on 28 August 2004. His successor, appointed next day, was his first-team coach Billy Davies. In two consecutive seasons under Davies, Preston reached the Championship play-offs. At Cardiff's Millennium Stadium in the 2005 final, they were beaten by 1‚Äì0 by West Ham United. In the following season, they were defeated in the semi- finals by Leeds United. The team had finished fourth in 2005‚Äì06 and this was the club's highest second-tier league position since Jimmy Milne's team finished third in 1964. On 2 June 2006, Davies left to take over at Derby County and was succeeded on 17 June by Paul Simpson. Simpson had been the manager of Carlisle United and he quickly replaced the recently departed defenders Claude Davis and Tyrone Mears with Sean St. Ledger and Liam Chilvers. The 2006‚Äì07 season began well under Simpson and Preston rose to the top of the Championship in December, the highest league place the team had reached since relegation from the top flight in 1961. On 28 March, striker David Nugent made his full international debut for England and scored in the 90th minute of the match against Andorra. Nugent was the first Preston player since Tom Finney to represent England. In the league, the team lost form towards the end of the season and finished seventh to miss the play-offs. On 11 July 2007, Nugent left Preston to join Portsmouth for a club record fee (i.e., received by Preston) of ¬£6,000,000. Simpson, with a much increased transfer budget following this sale, brought in Billy Jones, Kevin Nicholls, Karl Hawley and Darren Carter. Despite these signings, Preston's poor form at the end of the previous season continued and they had won only three matches when Simpson was sacked on 13 November 2007. He was replaced on 20 November 2007 by Alan Irvine, who was David Moyes' assistant manager at Everton, on a 3¬Ω-year contract. Irvine was able to lift the team out of the relegation zone to finish fifteenth. 2008 to present=Completion of Deepdale re- development The re-development of Deepdale, begun in 1995, was completed ahead of the 2008‚Äì09 season with the opening of the Invincibles Pavilion, opposite the Sir Tom Finney Stand, to replace the 1930s-built \\"Pavilion\\" stand on the east side of the ground. In further commemoration of Tom Finney, the club's address was changed to Deepdale Stadium, Sir Tom Finney Way, Preston. This road is that part of the A6063, formerly called Deepdale Road, which runs past the west side of the ground. There is an adjacent residential road called Bill Shankly Crescent. As a result of the re-development, Deepdale became an all-seater stadium with a capacity of 23,404. Hopes that the finished stadium might soon feature Premier League football were dashed when the team, who had finished sixth in the 2008‚Äì09 Championship, were beaten 1‚Äì2 on aggregate by Sheffield United in the two-leg play-off semi-final. On 29 December 2009, manager Alan Irvine was surprisingly dismissed after a run of ten matches with only one win. The team continued to struggle and in 2011 were relegated to the third-tier Football League One, where they remained for the next four years. Trevor Hemmings takeover Preston North End as a business faced another crisis at this time with a winding up petition being served by HM Revenue and Customs on 14 May 2010 and all shares in the company being suspended. A deal was arranged whereby the club was taken over by Trevor Hemmings, a successful Lancashire businessman, whose company Deepdale PNE Holdings Limited secured a 51% shareholding. Currently (i.e., as formally declared under EFL regulations on 3 May 2017), Preston North End is a limited company owned 100 per cent by Deepdale PNE Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Wordon Group Limited which is incorporated in the Isle of Man and controlled by the family interests of Trevor Hemmings. Hemmings hired Maurice Lindsay, prominent in rugby league as a past chairman of Wigan R.L.F.C., to take over as club chairman in place of Derek Shaw, who stepped aside to become club vice- president. Through the 2010‚Äì11 season, which ended in relegation, a cost- cutting policy was implemented to put the business back onto a sound economic footing and eight of the team's higher-paid players were transferred out. In December 2011, Lindsay had to retire due to ill health and was replaced days later by Peter Ridsdale. Ridsdale stepped aside in October 2012 following an insolvency action but has continued to act as an advisor to Hemmings. Preston now have a chief executive instead of a chairman and this has been John Kay from 1 November 2014. Simon Grayson, manager (2013‚Äì2017) Simon Grayson was appointed as manager on 18 February 2013. He was the club's fifth manager in four seasons, after Irvine, Darren Ferguson, Phil Brown and Graham Westley. Under Grayson, Preston qualified for both the 2014 and 2015 League One play- offs. The team lost the semi-final in 2014 and then gained promotion back to the second-tier Championship by defeating Swindon Town 4‚Äì0 in the 2015 final at Wembley. Earlier in the 2014‚Äì15 season, Preston enjoyed a good run in the FA Cup and reached the fifth round (last sixteen) for the first time since 2008. They were drawn at home against Manchester United in a tie that attracted 21,348 and was given national live TV coverage. It was United's first visit to Deepdale since 1972. A 47th-minute goal by Scott Laird gave Preston a surprise lead but United rallied to win 1‚Äì3. Championship consolidation was achieved in 2015‚Äì16 as the team won fifteen matches to finish eleventh. The Football League was renamed the English Football League (EFL) in summer 2016 and so the second tier became the EFL Championship. Preston finished eleventh again in 2016‚Äì17. Grayson left the club in June 2017 to manage Sunderland. Alex Neil, manager (2017‚Äì) Grayson's replacement was Alex Neil, appointed on 4 July 2017. In his first season, Preston finished seventh in the 2017‚Äì18 EFL Championship, just outside the play-off positions and the club's highest finish since the team was sixth in 2009.

Jurisdiction Coroners have jurisdiction over the remains of a person and the power to make findings in respect of the cause of death of a person. In the territory, they also have power to hold inquests into disasters that occur wholly or partly in the territory. Generally there are no appeals from the decision of a coroner, although there is provision for the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory to order a fresh inquest or inquiry or to grant prerogative relief in respect of the proceedings. History The office of coroner in the territory derives from the legal framework of the office of coroner inherited from the United Kingdom when Australia was settled by the British in 1788. The first Governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip, was a coroner by virtue of his commission as governor. Technically, he was the first coroner of the territory as the territory was part of New South Wales at that time. Practically however, he had no presence there, and no need to exercise jurisdiction. The governor's commission also entitled him to appoint others as coroners as required, and this was most likely to have been to justices of the peace. Structure and jurisdiction The Administrator of the Northern Territory may appoint a Territory Coroner for the territory. The Territory Coroner has the function to oversee and co-ordinate coronial services in the territory, ensure that all deaths and suspected deaths concerning which a coroner has jurisdiction to hold an inquest properly investigated, ensuring that an inquest or inquiry is held whenever it is required, and to issue guidelines to coroners to assist them in the exercise or performance of their functions. The administrator may also appoint deputy coroners. Deputy coroners essentially have all the functions of a coroner except that they cannot hold an inquest into a death in custody. All stipendiary magistrates in the territory are coroners by virtue of their appointment as a magistrate.

The men were formally mustered into Confederate service as the 16th Battalion, South Carolina Cavalry on July 23, 1862. The 6th South Carolina Cavalry was then organized in January 1863, using the 16th Battalion as its nucleus. Some of the men were from Columbia, including several students from The Citadel Academy. The 6th Cavalry saw action at Willstown and Pon Pon River in South Carolina, and then moved to Virginia with about 1,000 men and was assigned to the Cavalry Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia. Assigned to General Matthew C. Butler's brigade, the regiment participated in the Wilderness and Cold Harbor operations and in various conflicts south of the James River. Later, it was engaged in the Carolinas Campaign assigned to Logan's Brigade. The depleted regiment surrendered with the Army of Tennessee at Bennett Place in North Carolina.

The mission concept is for low cost military and commercial satellite space launches. This spaceplane concept is unrelated to India's RLV Technology Demonstration Programme (RLV-TD). Concept In Sanskrit, the word ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§§‡§æ‡§∞ ' is derived from ‡§Ö‡§µ-‡§§‡§∞ ' (lit. to move/cross below, i.e. descend) and literally means \\"that which descends\\". In Hinduism, an avatar refers to deliberate descent of a deity to Earth, or a descent of the Supreme Being. The idea is to develop a spaceplane vehicle that can take off from conventional airfields. Its liquid air cycle engine would collect air in the atmosphere on the way up, liquefy it, separate oxygen and store it on board for subsequent flight beyond the atmosphere. The Avatar, a reusable launch vehicle, was first announced in May 1998 at the Aero India 98 exhibition held at Bangalore. Avatar is projected to weigh 25 tons, of which 60% of that mass would be liquid hydrogen fuel. The oxygen required by the vehicle for combustion in outer space would be collected from the atmosphere during takeoff, thus reducing the need to carry oxygen during launch. The notional specification is for a payload weighing up to to low Earth orbit and to withstand up to 100 launches and reentries. If built, Avatar would take off horizontally like a conventional airplane from a conventional airstrip using turbo-ramjet engines that burn hydrogen and atmospheric oxygen. During this cruising phase, an on-board system would collect air from the atmosphere, from which liquid oxygen would be separated and stored and used to burn the stored hydrogen in the final flight phase to attain orbit. The vehicle would be designed to permit at least one hundred launches and atmospheric reentries. Feasibility study The Avatar concept study was commissioned by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation in 2001. India's Space Agency ISRO has no connection with the project. Air Commodore Raghavan Gopalaswami, who headed the study, made a presentation on the spaceplane at the global conference on propulsion at Salt Lake City, United States on July 10, 2001.

He was also Hamilton's 27th Mayor. Queen Street is a Lower City arterial road in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It starts off at Beckett Drive, a mountain-access road in the city and is a two- way street up to Herkimer Street and a one-way street (Southbound) the rest of the way north up to the Canadian National Railway Yard where the road turns right, merging with Stuart Street which travels in a west‚Äìeast direction. History Queen Street was named after Queen Caroline of Brunswick, wife of King George IV. Queen Street forms the western boundary line of the Durand neighbourhood. Durand is also bounded by Main Street to the north, James Street and James Mountain Road to the east and the Niagara Escarpment to the south. With the turn of the 20th century, luxurious new residences were built along Markland and Aberdeen Avenues and to the south in the lee of the escarpment. These residences reflected the entrepreneurial spirit of those who made their fortunes in transportation, finance, industry, and commerce in one of North Americas major centres, Hamilton. By 1920, the Durand neighbourhood was considered to be the ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù neighbourhood in Hamilton. However, the Great Depression and the Second World War took their tolls on the fortunes of many of the established Durand households. Owners could no longer afford the taxes and upkeep on their homes, and many of the grander residences were either demolished and replaced with middle-class low-rise housing, or were renovated to become low-rise apartment buildings. Much of the heritage of the neighbourhood survives today. HAAA Grounds - Photo by Mike F. Campbell Hamilton Tigers circa 1906, Hamilton Amateur Athletic Association Grounds. Durand neighbourhood, Queen Street South Player's Guild Hamilton Inc. Queen's Terrace/ Oxford Heights, apartment buildings The Hamilton A.A.A. Grounds, (Hamilton Amateur Athletic Association Grounds), is a park that was home to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats from 1872-1949. Entrance to the park at Queen Street South is right before Charlton Avenue West. Today it is also the site of the Hamilton Tennis Club. Today Ivor Wynne Stadium is the home of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. It's off of Beachwood Avenue, 2 blocks West of Gage Avenue North. The TH&B; Railway came into Hamilton in 1895. A railway tunnel was then constructed from Queen to Park Street to cut down on the noise, pollution and disruption for the wealthy families who lived South of Jackson Street in the Durand neighbourhood. In 1964, Imperial Tobacco Company's Hamilton operations are moved to Guelph, Ontario. Originally it was known as the Tuckett Tobacco Company which was started up by George Elias Tuckett, (1835‚Äì1900), who was also Hamilton's 27th Mayor in 1896. Today the property is the site of two high-rise apartment buildings, Queen's Terrace and Oxford Heights. Tuckett's home was the Scottish Rite Castle, also on Queen Street, remains as one of Hamilton's most magnificent structures. At its peak the Tuckett Tobacco Company employed 600 workers and products were sold throughout the world. The first factory opened up in the 1860s near the intersection of King and Bay Streets. The Queen Street North factory opened up 28 February 1891 and stayed opened until 17 September 1966. Bruce Trail One can reach the Bruce Trail via Queen Street South. The trail cuts through the city along the Niagara Escarpment (mountain) and used by many locals for a full days hike. The Trail is long and starts at Niagara Falls, passes through Hamilton and ends at the Bruce Peninsula. Hikers are led to scenic gorges, hidden waterfalls and places of quiet charm.

Digital photograph restoration is the practice of restoring the appearance of a digital copy of a physical photograph which has been damaged by natural, man made, or environmental causes or simply affected by age or neglect. Digital photograph restoration uses a variety of image editing techniques to remove visible damage and aging effects from digital copies of physical photographs. Raster graphics editors are typically used to repair the appearance of the digital images and add to the digital copy to replace torn or missing pieces of the physical photograph. Evidence of dirt, and scratches, and other signs of photographic age are removed from the digital image manually, by painting over them meticulously. Unwanted color casts are removed and the image's contrast or sharpening may be altered in an attempt to restore some of the contrast range or detail that is believed to have been in the original physical image. Image processing techniques such as image enhancement and image restoration are also applicable for the purpose of digital photograph restoration.

His artwork was greatly influenced by themes of Chinese Buddhism. The Five Hundred Luohan Lin Tinggui is best known for taking part alongside Zhou Jichang (Japanese: Shuu Kijou) in the completion of the Five Hundred Luohan (Chinese: Wubai Luohan), a set of 100 paintings commissioned as a gift to a Buddhist temple in 1175 by a Chinese Buddhist abbot. This artistic project in honor of the luohan was completed three years later in 1178. In Chinese Buddhist folklore, it was said that five hundred luohan (Buddhist saints) inhabited a peak beyond the stone bridge of Mount Tiantai located at Jiuhuashan, modern-day Qingyang County, Anhui province, China. This belief was either formed from an older Daoist belief that the site was home to immortals, or from knowledge of Buddhist legend from India, specifically the belief of five hundred arhats living on Mt. Buddhavanagiri near Rajagrha. It was this belief that provided the central theme of Lin Tinggui and Zhou Jichang's artwork. The Five Hundred Luohan outside of China During the 13th century, the set of paintings completed by Lin Tinggui and Zhou Jichang were imported to Japan and wound up as the property of Jufuku-ji Temple in Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan. Hand-painted copies of the scrolls were made in 1368 by the Japanese painter-priest Minchou (1351 - 1431 AD) for the Buddhist temples Engaku-ji and Toufuku-ji in Kamakura. The painting set was moved by the Hojo warrior family at a later date to Sounji, and in the 16th century they were taken from eastern Japan by the late Sengoku period warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi as spoils of war. He placed this precious set of 100 paintings in the H≈çk≈ç-ji Temple, near Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan. The painting set was then finally placed at the Rinzai Buddhist Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, Japan, in its subtemple of Soken'in, which Hideyoshi had sponsored in honor of his predecessor, Oda Nobunaga. In 1894, the temple was in need of funds for repair, and so auctioned forty-four of the 100 painted scrolls in Boston. Ten of these paintings were sold by the Japanese during the exhibit (while the rest returned to Kyoto), while the painting Luohan Laundering by Lin Tinggui was given as a gift to the tour's American organizer. The latter then sold the painting in 1902 to Charles Lang Freer, and is now housed in the Freer Gallery of Art, part of the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C. In this famous painting of Lin Tinggui, Luohan Laundering (1178), five brightly colored Luohan and one attendant are seen washing their clothes and hanging them out to dry by a gushing stream moving through a dismally brown-shaded and thick-wooded landscape. On the lower right-hand corner of the painting, almost invisible to the naked eye, is a small signature penned in gold by Lin Tinggui. The Freer Gallery also has a painting from the set done by Zhou Jichang, called Rock Bridge at Tiantai Mountain. Several other works in the Five Hundred Luohan set by Lin Tinggui and Zhou Jichang alike are at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

In 2014 it took place between October 30 and November 3. The fiesta is held just outside Saga City, along the Kase River. It has grown from a gathering of 5 hot air balloons to a competition where over 3500 people volunteer, and has gained a reputation as one of the top ballooning competitions in the world. It is also a popular time for tourists as the Karatsu Kunchi Festival is held at the same time in Karatsu City. Since 1980 the launch site has been visited by over 10 million spectators. For the duration of the event, a temporary JR station (Balloon Saga Station) ferries passengers between Saga City and Kubota. History The fiesta started in 1978 in Amagi City, Fukuoka Prefecture, as a smaller ballooning event, the Balloon Fiesta in Kyushu. In 1980 the Fiesta was moved to the outskirts of Saga City, where there is more room. In 1984 it became an international competition and was given its present name; in the same year the first Japanese National Hot Air Balloon Championship was held, and balloonists from all over Japan came to the grounds. Since 1984 there have been approximately 640 balloons from overseas participants (nearly 3000 crew and pilots). In 1990 the first Pacific Championship was held in Saga. Between 1990 and 1996 women from around the world gathered to participate in the Ladies World Cup. Saga was the first place to have a competition of this kind. Beginning in 1992 a category for special shaped balloons, called Balloon Fantasia was created. Also started at this time was the La Montgolfier Nocturne (The Night of Hot Air Balloons); tethered inflated balloons light their burners in a choreographed manner, illuminating their unique shapes. This is a highlight of the fiesta. In November 1997 the 13th Hot Air Balloon World Championships were again held in Saga. With numbers rarely seen outside of the United States, this event was attended by over 38 countries and territories. There were 112 balloons present for the World Championship and together with the balloons that were competing in the Honda Grand Prix Final Battle, Balloon Fantasia, and official balloons there were 170 balloons flying through the skies of Saga. In 1997, special days during the Fiesta were established for people to experience the balloons. These include Heartful Day, a day geared toward handicapped members of the community; and Kids Day, a hot air balloon classroom for children.

Early life Guthrie was born in Mauritius, the son of Frederick Guthrie, F.R.S. and Agnes Guthrie, n√©e Bickell. Guthrie was educated at University College, London, and at the University of Marburg under Professor Zincke. He was assistant to the professor of chemistry at Queen's College, Cork, from 1882, and in 1888 became demonstrator in chemistry at the Royal College of Science, London under Sir Thomas Thorpe. Career in Australia Guthrie came to Australia in 1890 and in the same year was appointed demonstrator in chemistry at the University of Sydney under Archibald Liversidge. In 1892 he was made chemist to the New South Wales department of agriculture. In this department he did much research in connexion with soil analysis, manures, and the milling qualities of wheat. He was also closely associated with William Farrer and his work on wheat breeding; Guthrie devised methods to test small quantities of grain and assess their quality. For periods in 1896, 1904-5, and 1908-9 Guthrie was acting- professor of chemistry at the University of Sydney. In 1901 he was president of the chemical section of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, and in 1913 president of the agricultural section. He was elected president of the Royal Society of New South Wales for 1903 and was one of the joint honorary secretaries from 1906 to 1910. Guthrie was also an original member of the Commonwealth advisory council of science and industry. He retired from the agricultural department of New South Wales in January 1924, and died of cancer at Sydney on 7 February 1927. Legacy Guthrie married Ada Adams, who survived him with a daughter. He lost his two sons in World War I. He wrote many papers for scientific societies some of which were published as pamphlets. His work as an economic and agricultural chemist was of widespread benefit to primary production in Australia. The Guthrie medal, named in his honour, is awarded every three years by the Royal Australian Chemical Institute.

It is one of three preserved Baldwin Class 8/18 C locomotives in the United States, of which it is the only operable example. It is listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places.  History  The locomotive was built by Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1875 for the Eureka & Palisade Railroad in Nevada, which was built to transport passengers and goods from the mining town of Eureka to connect with the Central Pacific Railroad in Palisade. The engine served on this railroad until 1896, when it was sold to the Sierra Nevada Wood and Lumber Company. It operated on the Sierra Nevada Wood and Lumber until 1938 when the company dissolved and the engine was sold to a scrap dealer. Warner Bros. bought the engine in 1939, and it was featured in many films, such as Torrid Zone, Cheyenne Autumn, and The Great Train Robbery. The Eurekas last film appearance was in the 1976 film, The Shootist. In 1978, the California State Railroad Museum was in the process of restoring North Pacific Coast no. 12 Sonoma, another 8/18C class 4-4-0 nearly identical to the Eureka. The museum had the latter stripped down to reveal its original paint scheme that was still on the engine, and used it as a guide for restoring the former. The Eureka was later sold to Old Vegas, an amusement park in Henderson, Nevada, where it was placed on display in 1980. In 1985, a fire occurred at Old Vegas, with a burning building collapsing on the Eureka, badly damaging the engine. A year later, the engine was discovered by Las Vegas attorney Dan Markoff, who then purchased the engine and restored it to operating condition with the help of his father. The restored Eureka debuted at Railfair '91 at the California State Railroad Museum. It was then operated on U.S. Gypsum's private tracks in Plaster City, California, in 1993. The locomotive was listed as a structure on the National Register of Historic Places on January 12, 1995 and was the first transportation listing in Las Vegas. In 1997, Eureka was transported to Chama, New Mexico, for a series of operational excursions over the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad in late June. The engine continues to make appearances at various narrow gauge tourist railroads during special events, such as the Cumbres and Toltec, Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, the Nevada State Railroad Museum, and the Nevada Southern Railroad Museum among others.

Each part of the series was a rewriting of an original novel, with surreal comic elements added that fit into certain points of the originals, whilst at the same time poking fun at the situations involved. The Bible‚Äîthe Old Testament According to Spike Milligan The Bible‚Äîthe Old Testament According to Spike Milligan is a 1993 parody novel and the first book in the series. The book is an almost verbatim parody of the Old Testament, with some exceptions. It does not list each section by the names featured in the Bible (Genesis, Exodus etc.), and omits some Bible stories, such as the Tower of Babel, to save time. Frankenstein According to Spike Milligan Frankenstein According to Spike Milligan is a comic-horror novel released in 1997, the second book in the series. It is a parody of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. The story is a simplified and humorous version of the original novel, with minor changes. In this equivalent, Frankenstein's monster is a heavy smoker whose trousers are constantly falling, and Dr. Frankenstein is continually put in a straitjacket when he begins to talk about the monster he created. Also, there are running gags about Dr. Frankenstein's sea voyages during which his ship sinks, the monster disappearing mysteriously because he runs at speeds of 100 mph, and notes by an editor (Milligan) making sarcastic remarks about events in the novel. The Hound of the Baskervilles According to Spike Milligan The Hound of the Baskervilles According to Spike Milligan is a spoof of The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The plot is almost the same as the original, the main differences being that the Spike Milligan version is considerably shorter, and there is more humorous content. Written from the viewpoint of Dr. Watson (who is accompanied by a duck throughout the story), Holmes takes on the case of a strange curse on the Baskerville estate. He wears an odd pair of boots owned by Sir Henry Baskerville, bullies a German butler, and forces Dr. Mortimer to openly exclaim \\"Fuck!\\" The illustrations repeatedly show Watson being attacked, or about to be attacked, by a small dog. Spike Milligan previously had appeared in the 1978 film adaptation of The Hound of the Baskervilles in a cameo role. The illustrations pay tribute to the Sherlock Holmes films and the portrayal of Holmes and Watson by Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Robin Hood According to Spike Milligan Robin Hood According to Spike Milligan is a 1998 parody novel. Unlike other books in the series, Milligan did not parody any particular book about Robin Hood (although the majority of material parodies The Adventures of Robin Hood by Roger Lancelyn Green), but the whole legend of Robin Hood and the figures involved. The book portrays Robin Hood as short- tempered, Friar Tuck as a drunkard, and various other figures of the Robin Hood legend in bizarre yet humorous situations. ;Characters *Robin Hood - Leader of his band of Merry Men *Little John - Alias \\"Big Dick\\" *Will Scarlet - One of the Merry Men *Maid Marian - Robin's wife *King John - Ruler of England *Guy of Gisbourne - Alias \\"Guy de Custard Gisborne\\" *Groucho Marx - A junior in the Merry Men Treasure Island According to Spike Milligan Treasure Island According to Spike Milligan is a comic novel spoof of Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. Published in 2000, it is the last book in the series. In the book, Jim Hawkins has met a rum-addicted sailor known only as \\"Captain\\", who leaves Jim a treasure map upon his death. With his father dying, Jim is forced from the Benbow with his mother and his friend Groucho Marx to search for the buried treasure. The book itself actually breaks the mould from Milligan's previous parody novels. Whilst his previous works were essentially comic versions of the original texts, this version adds Groucho Marx to the cast as the friend of Jim Hawkins and breaks off from the original layout into a script format (usually when Groucho is speaking). The story also includes references to his previous works, such as The Hound of the Baskervilles According to Spike Milligan (such as a running gag involving a dog). Milligan previously starred as Ben Gunn in productions of Treasure Island for the Mermaid Theatre. The cover of the 2000 edition portrayed Robert Newton as Long John Silver.

He was a proponent of wholemeal (whole grain) bread consumption. His name is still used today for a bread popular in Europe, Allinson bread.Welcome to over 100 years of Allinson quality and taste. allinsonflour.co.uk Biography Dr. Allinson's Vegetarian Cookery, 1910 Allinson was born in the Hulme district of Manchester on 29 March 1858. He went to school in Lancaster and Manchester and at fifteen began work as a chemist's assistant. With money he saved and financial help from his stepfather, he was able to attend the extramural medical school in Edinburgh, which was less expensive than the University medical school. He graduated as a Licenciate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (LRCP, LRCS) in 1879. After assistantships in Hull and the East End of London he established his own practice in Marylebone in 1885. During the 1880s Allinson developed his theory of medicine, which he called Hygienic Medicine.Pepper S (1992) Allinson's Staff of Life. History Today 42:30‚Äì35 In place of orthodox medicine, he promoted health through diet, exercise, fresh air and bathing. He advocated a vegetarian diet and the avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, coffee and tea. He especially promoted the benefits of stone-ground wholemeal breads. He opposed the use of drugs by doctors, many of which at that time were ineffective and toxic and was a lifelong opponent of compulsory vaccination against smallpox. This approach became known as Allinsonian Medicine. He became medical editor of the Weekly Times and Echo in 1885, for which he wrote over 1000 articles during his life, as well as answering readers' medical queries. He wrote a number of books and pamphlets directed at a general rather than medical readership, including A System of Hygienic Medicine (1886), How to avoid Vaccination (1888), The Advantage of Wholemeal Bread, Medical Essays and A Book for Married Women (1894) and books on stomach diseases, consumption (tuberculosis), rheumatism, vegetarian cooking and healthy diet. He gave frequent public lectures throughout the country propounding his ideas. In one of his books, The Advantages of Wholemeal Bread (1889), he proposed that wholemeal bread was healthier than white (or refined) bread. He believed that smoking was a cause of cancer, which was a radical idea at the time. Allinson regularly sought publicity for his theories and practices in the press and directed his energies not just towards his colleagues but directly to the public. To demonstrate the suitability of a vegetarian diet for strenuous exercise, he undertook a walk from Edinburgh to London in 1891. He walked for 15 consecutive days, averaging a day, arriving in London on Saturday, September 12. His views often brought him into conflict with the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and the General Medical Council, particularly his opposition to doctors' frequent use of toxic drugs, his opposition to vaccination and his self-promotion in the press. In 1892 he was struck off the Medical Register. Despite this he continued to practise and indeed maintained he had the largest medical practice in England. Also at this time he was expelled from the Vegetarian Society because of his views on birth control. Gandhi, who was studying law in Britain at the time and was also a member of the Vegetarian Society, spoke in favour of Allinson's right to support contraception, despite being opposed to it. In 1892 he founded the Natural Food Company with the intention of producing and selling healthy foods; he bought a stone grinding flour mill in Bethnal Green, and a bakery was established shortly afterwards. His Book for Married Women advocated equality of women and men, the right of a woman to choose the size of her family, and birth control. For this he was prosecuted and convicted under the Obscene Publications Act in 1901. During World War I, the food value of wholemeal bread was recognised. Although it has been claimed that Allinson was offered the right to re-register during WW1, the General Medical Council has no record of this and by that time he had no registrable qualifications. His company flourished from the increased demand for whole-grain bread and meal. After his death, the company grew: two more stone-grinding mills were purchased in Newport, Monmouthshire and in 1921 Castleford, Yorkshire. The mills stand to this day. Allinson died from tuberculosis, at his home in Marylebone, on 29 November 1918. Bread Allinson's original bread recipe (100% whole grain flour, no fat, less yeast, more water) is still used today, though some lovers of Allinson bread report that it's not as hearty nowadays as it used to be.Flour Power ‚Äì A Scottish Perspective at www.uni-ulm.de The advertising slogan for the brand since the 1980s is \\"Bread wi' nowt [with nothing] taken out\\". Vanity Fair In 1911, Allinson bought the failing magazine Vanity Fair from Frank Harris. He failed to revive its fortunes and, in 1914, Vanity Fair merged with Hearth and Home.

The river in turn was named after the Reverend Samuel Hinds, a member of the Canterbury Association that organised the settlement of Canterbury.

H. Friston from The Illustrated London News The Princess is a blank verse farcical play, in five scenes with music, by W. S. Gilbert which adapts and parodies Alfred Lord Tennyson's humorous 1847 narrative poem, The Princess. It was first produced at the Olympic Theatre in London on 8 January 1870. Gilbert called the piece \\"a whimsical allegory ... a respectful operatic per-version\\" of Tennyson's poem. The play was a modest success, playing for about 82 performances through April and enjoying a provincial tour.Information about the playMoss, Simon. \\"The Princess\\" at Gilbert & Sullivan: a selling exhibition of memorabilia, c20th.com, accessed 16 November 2009 Gilbert liked the theme so much that he adapted the play as the libretto to Princess Ida (1884), one of his Savoy Operas with Arthur Sullivan. The Princess is a satire of women's education, a controversial subject in 1847, when Queen's College first opened in London, and in 1870 (Girton opened in 1869), but less so by 1884. Background The Princess came fairly early in Gilbert's playwriting career, after his very successful one-act comic opera, Ages Ago (1869) and before Our Island Home (1870, another such piece). The play was Gilbert's first of the 1870s, a decade during which he wrote more than thirty-five plays, encompassing most genres of comedy and drama, including his series of blank verse \\"fairy comedies\\", beginning with The Palace of Truth later in 1870 and his first operas with Arthur Sullivan. In 1870, Gilbert was establishing his \\"topsy-turvy\\" style and proving that his capabilities extended well beyond his early burlesques and extravaganzas. The Princess is one of several Gilbert plays, including The Wicked World, Broken Hearts, and the later operas, Iolanthe, Princess Ida, and Fallen Fairies, where the introduction of males into a tranquil world of women brings \\"mortal love\\" that wreaks havoc with the status quo.Introduction to Broken Hearts, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 10 March 2009 Stedman calls this a \\"Gilbertian invasion plot\\".Stedman (p. 95): In \\"a Gilbertian invasion\\" plot, outsiders change a tranquil society, as where the Thespians take control of Olympus in Thespis, and the Flowers of Progress remodel Utopia in Utopia, Limited. right The play is a farcical burlesque of Tennyson's 1847 narrative blank-verse poem, The Princess. Gilbert's play is also written in blank verse and retains Tennyson's basic serio-comic story line about a heroic princess who runs a women's college and about the prince who loves her. He and his two friends infiltrate the college disguised as female students. Gilbert returned to his play in 1883, adapting it as one of his operas with Arthur Sullivan, entitled Princess Ida. When Tennyson published his poem, women's higher education was a novel, even radical concept.Queen's College, London, the first women's college, had been founded in 1847, but it was not quite a higher education institution in the modern sense: it admitted girls and women from the age of twelve upwards. See Scott, Patrick. \\"Tennyson, Interpreter of Mid-Victorian Britain\\", 1992 exhibit on Tennyson's works, including \\"The Princess\\"] and British History Online When Gilbert wrote The Princess in 1870, women's higher education was still an innovative idea.Mack, Beverly B. and Heidi A. Strobel, \\"Scholars and Scholarship\\", Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History, edited by Bonnie G. Smith, Oxford University Press, 2008, accessed 1 September 2009. Girton College, the first university-level women's college in Britain, had been established at the University of Cambridge in 1869.Even so, it was not recognised as a full constituent of the university until 1948. See Girton's official website However, by the time Gilbert and Sullivan collaborated on Princess Ida in 1883, a women's college was a well-established concept. Westfield College, London's first women's college, had opened in 1882 and is cited as a model for Castle Adamant, the women's college in Princess Ida.In 1983, Janet Sondheimer published a history of the college called Castle Adamant in Hampstead. The lyrics to the songs in The Princess were set to popular tunes from popular operetta and grand opera of the time, including works by Herv√© and Jacques Offenbach. The three young men are played by women, so that, during a large part of the play, women are playing men disguised as women. Gilbert had been eager to try a \\"blank verse burlesque in which a picturesque story should be told in a strain of mock-heroic seriousness.\\" The satire in the piece is of a higher intellectual order than the pun-filled burlesques playing in London at the time, and the publicity for the play touted this.Stedman, p. 77, quoting Gilbert, W. S. \\"An Autobiography\\" in Theatre, NS 1 (Apr. 1883), p. 220. The dialogue in Princess Ida is little changed from that in The Princess.

The plot is essentially the same as the later opera: Ida's misshapen father, King Gama, and his three hulking sons (played as breeches roles in The Princess) arrive at the court of King Hildebrand. They bring news that the beautiful Princess Ida, to whom Hildebrand's son, Prince Hilarion, was betrothed in infancy, will not honour her marriage vows. She rules a women's university and excludes all men from entering. Hilarion and two companions (also played by women) disguise themselves as female students and sneak inside the walls, but they are soon discovered, eventually causing chaos and panic, during which the prince has occasion to save Ida's life. Hildebrand agrees to give Ida a chance: The outcome of a tournament pitting her three brothers against Hilarion and his two friends will decide whether she must marry the Prince. In the battle, the Prince and his friends wound Ida's brothers, after which she accepts the Prince as her husband, admitting that she loves him (in Tennyson's poem, the Prince is defeated, but Ida, nursing him to health, comes to love him).

He rose to power in the mid-nineties after he allegedly fought a war for control of the criminal organization. He led the crime family in gambling, loan sharking and extortion. In comparison to other traditional mob bosses who shunned the limelight, Merlino interacted regularly with the media and the public.http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article1943159.html He is the son of deceased Philadelphia crime family underboss Chuckie Merlino. With the help of informant Ralph Natale, Merlino was convicted of several RICO charges including racketeering, illegal gambling and extortion, in 2001, and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Since his release from prison in 2011, the FBI and organized crime reporters believe he continues to run the Philadelphia-South Jersey Mafia. Merlino disputes this, claiming he retired from a life of crime. As of 2015, Merlino divides his time between south Florida and Philadelphia.  Early life  Merlino was born on March 13, 1962, in Philadelphia to Italian-American parents Salvatore \\"Chuckie\\" Merlino and Rita Giordano. Merlino was raised in South Philadelphia and Ventnor City, New Jersey. He is also the nephew of deceased Philadelphia crime family mobster-turned government witness Lawrence \\"Yogi\\" Merlino. Joey's sister was briefly engaged to Salvatore Testa. He had been friends with future made man in the Philadelphia crime family Michael \\"Mikey Chang\\" Ciancaglini and his brother Joseph \\"Joey Chang\\" Ciancaglini, Jr. since attending St. Thomas Aquinas grade school in Philadelphia's Point Breeze neighborhood. Merlino's father owned and operated the 9M Bar in Southwark that Nicky Scarfo used as his criminal headquarters during his attempt to become the new boss of the Philadelphia crime family.http://www.state.nj.us/sci/pdf/ocbars2.pdf Criminal activity In August 1982 at age 20, Merlino and Salvatore Scafidi, son of bookmaker Gaetano Scafidi Sr., beat and stabbed two male patrons at the Lido Restaurant in Atlantic City. In 1984 Merlino was found guilty on two counts of aggravated assault and one count of possession of a weapon for unlawful purpose.https://web.archive.org/web/20110604163015/http://www.state.nj.us/lps/ge/exclusion/merlino_j.htm In August 1984 he was banned by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission from New Jersey casinos. His father Salvatore would also be banned by exactly the same commission as his son for his criminal activities on May 23, 1984. Nicky Scarfo demoted his father Salvatore from his position as underboss to soldier because of his father's alcoholism. In 1988 Salvatore was sentenced to 45 years in federal prison for two counts of racketeering and drug trafficking. Joseph Merlino has been described as a particularly vicious person, obsessed with his own public image, and another version of New York's John Gotti. \\"Joey was a party guy,\\" said mob associate Ron Previte, a police officer-turned gangster-turned government witness. \\"He liked to go out. He liked to gamble. He liked the high life.\\" He invited TV crews to his annual Christmas party for the homeless, and was a fixture at the city's nightclubs, restaurants, and sporting events. Along with his longtime buddies and future mobsters, he was known to beat up people, rob people, and start fights in clubs. On October 31, 1989, Nicky, Jr., the son of imprisoned Philadelphia family boss Nicky Scarfo, Sr., was shot in an Italian restaurant in Bella Vista. The younger Scarfo was shot eight times with a MAC-10, but was not hit in any vital organs. He quickly recovered and left the hospital less than two weeks later. No one was ever charged with the attempted murder, but the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and local law enforcement believe Merlino carried out the shooting to settle a score between the Scarfos and Merlinos and to show that the elder Scarfo had no more power in Philadelphia. Merlino denied any involvement and claimed he was at home under house arrest the night of the shooting. Years later when a TV reporter approached Merlino and asked about a rumoured $500,000 bounty on his life, Merlino responded \\"Give me the half million dollars and I‚Äôll shoot myself.\\" In August 1989, Merlino was charged with interstate theft and conspiracy charges stemming from an incident where $352,000 was stolen from a Federal Armored Express truck in 1987. In January 1990, Merlino was convicted of planning the heist and sentenced to three years in prison.  Mob wars  Gaetano \\"Horsehead\\" Scafidi (left) was a childhood friend of Merlino. He eventually switched allegiance to John Stanfa (right) in the 1990s. In 2000, he became a government witness and testified at Merlino's trial. Merlino served his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, McKean, where he met mobster Ralph Natale in 1990. Natale was a longtime mobster who was serving a 15-year prison sentence for arson and drug trafficking. According to Natale, he and Merlino began plotting to take over the Philadelphia crime family during this period. Natale named Michael Ciancaglini, Steven Mazzone, George Borgesi, Gaetano \\"Tommy Horsehead\\" Scafidi and Martin Angelina as Merlino's key associates and co-conspirators in the plan.Caparella, Kitty. \\"Recalling A Bloody Hit.\\" Philadelphia Daily News. April 24, 2001.Anastasia, George. \\"Mob Boss Natale Tells of 'Descent Into Hell'.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer. March 31, 2001. These men were all close friends of Merlino since high school and started moving in on criminal rackets in Philadelphia. When John Stanfa emerged as the new leader of the Philadelphia family in 1991, the young group of mobsters openly rebelled against him. The \\"Young Turks\\" as the press would eventually dub Merlino's tight-knit crew, struck first with the killing of Felix Bocchino on January 29, 1992. Merlino was released from prison in April 1992. In an attempt to quell further violence, Stanfa officially inducted Merlino and his best friend Michael Ciancaglini into the crime family. Stanfa hoped he would be able to keep tabs on the Merlino crew and make it easier to kill them if necessary. While this act of diplomacy temporarily ended the violence, by 1993 an all-out war broke out between Stanfa and Merlino. On August 5, 1993, Merlino survived a drive-by shooting assassination attempt by two Stanfa gunmen, taking four bullets in the leg and buttocks, while Ciancaglini was shot in the chest and died. On August 31, 1993, a drive by shooting was performed on Stanfa and his son while they were driving on the Schuylkill Expressway. Stanfa escaped uninjured and his son survived being shot in the jaw. On September 17, 1993, a friend of Merlino's was shot and killed by Stanfa gunmen. Stanfa gunman Philip Colletti testified in court that he planted a remote control bomb under Merlino's car several times, but that it failed to go off every time. In November 1993, Merlino was arrested by the FBI, charged with violation of his supervised release, and sent back to prison. Mob leader Stanfa was arrested for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act violations in March 1994, was convicted in 1995, and sentenced to life in 1996. With most of Stanfa's supporters also arrested and convicted, Merlino, released from prison in November 1994, won the war and named Ralph Natale as the new boss while positioning himself as his underboss. During Natale's reign, Merlino was the real power in the family, allowing Natale to become boss to direct law enforcement attention away from himself. Nevertheless, Merlino gained notoriety as a flamboyant, celebrity gangster who often went out partying with a large entourage. The press dubbed him the John Gotti of Passyunk Avenue due to his candid demeanor in front of news cameras (Passyunk Avenue being a street in South Philadelphia). He also invited the press when he held Christmas parties for the homeless and gave away turkeys at Thanksgiving in housing projects. The arrogance and aggressiveness of Merlino‚Äòs young faction turned off a lot of criminals from working with the crime family. Merlino would often make big bets with bookies and refuse to pay when he lost. This practice, known as guzzling, was used on both independent and mob run bookies. During this time, Merlino and Natale oversaw the crime family's gambling, loan sharking, extortion and stolen goods rackets. In 1995, Louis Turra, leader of the Philadelphia drug gang the 10th and Oregon crew (also known as the 10th and O gang), was severely beaten by Merlino's men, allegedly for failing to pay a Mafia street tax on the gang's illegal earnings.\\"Who's the mob hit-wit\\" March 14, 1998. Philadelphia Daily News Angered by the beating, Turra sought vengeance. His father Anthony hosted a meeting at his house during which Anthony, Louis and his gang discussed killing Merlino. In January 1998, Louis Turra apparently hanged himself in a New York City jail while awaiting trial. In March 1998, Anthony Turra, on trial on charges of plotting to kill Merlino, was shot dead outside his home by a gunman in a black ski mask. He was shot twice as he left for the federal courthouse, where a jury was deliberating in the racketeering and drug case against him and four other men. \\"We consider this an organized crime assassination, a mob hit,\\" Police Inspector Jerrold Kane said. Three years later, Merlino was put on trial for helping orchestrate the murder, but was acquitted. By the late 1990s, Merlino dodged more than two dozen attempts on his life. Merlino was friends with Steve \\"Gorilla\\" Mondevergine, president of the Pagans MC motorcycle club. Merlino sometimes used the Pagans to help settle underworld disputes. During the 1990s, Merlino was also aligned with members of the Junior Black Mafia. Following Natale's arrest for parole violation in 1999, Merlino officially took over the crime family, cutting off Natale.  Racketeering conviction  On June 28, 1999, Merlino was indicted and detained without bail on one charge of conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine and one charge of unlawful use of a communication facility in relation to a drug trafficking offense.https://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/99D1011P.pdf The charges were later expanded to include racketeering and ordering or approving three murders and two attempted murders. Six other men were also put on trial. The prosecution's case was aided by several of Merlino's former Mafia cohorts agreeing to cooperate with the government. Natale agreed to cooperate in order to escape drug trafficking charges in 1999. Gaetano \\"Tommy Horsehead\\" Scafidi agreed to cooperate in 2000 while finishing a prison sentence due to fears that he would be murdered by Merlino's crew. Peter \\"the Crumb\\" Caprio agreed to cooperate with the government in 2000 after being charged with two murders and Ron Previte testified after becoming an undercover informant several years prior. They all testified that Natale and Merlino started a mob war to take over the Philadelphia crime family and that Merlino committed various criminal acts in the 1990s. On July 20, 2001, the jury returned a mixed verdict. Merlino was acquitted all of three counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder, however, was found guilty of racketeering charges including extortion, bookmaking and receiving stolen property. Along with Merlino, six of his peers were also convicted of various racketeering related charges. On December 3, 2001 Judge Herbert J. Hutton gave Merlino a 14-year prison sentence. Commenting on his conviction, \\"Ain't bad,\\" Merlino said. \\"Better than the death penalty.\\" A month after the verdict, Merlino was indicted in federal court again for the 1996 murder of Joseph Sodano, despite a jury finding the murder charge \\"not proven\\" as a RICO predicate act. In March 2004, Merlino was acquitted of Sodano's murder as a violent crime in aid of racketeering. Merlino served his prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Terre Haute, Indiana. Merlino was released from the correctional facility on March 15, 2011 after serving almost 12 years of his sentence. He was transferred to a halfway house in Florida for six months and then was on supervised release until 2015. On January 4, 2015, just before his parole restrictions expired, Judge Richard Barclay Surrick gave Merlino a four-month prison sentence for violating his supervised release by meeting with organized crime figures in Florida. On April 24, 2015, Merlino was released from the Federal Detention Center, Miami after his sentence was vacated. He was released 10 days early and was free of any post-release restrictions after he won an appeal from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.  Move to Florida  After his release in 2011, Merlino moved to Boca Raton, Florida. In a 2013 interview with George Anastasia, Merlino denied any current involvement in the Philadelphia Mafia and has stated that his life as a criminal is over. He was quoted in the interview stating \\"I want no part of that\\" and that there were \\"too many rats.\\" In November 2014, Merlino opened a restaurant in Boca Raton named Merlino's, that featured his mother's recipes. The restaurant was owned by a group of investors; Merlino is forbidden from owning an establishment that serves alcohol due to his criminal record.http://www.miamiherald.com/living/food-drink/article83109357.html Instead, Merlino officially worked there as a ma√Ætre d' until the restaurant closed in 2016. On September 7, 2016, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board banned Merlino from all casinos in Pennsylvania. On August 4, 2016, Merlino was one of 46 people arrested up and down the east coast in a RICO indictment. Merlino was arrested at his home in Florida and put on trial in New York City. Merlino was charged with one count of racketeering, one count of fraud and two counts of illegal gambling. Merlino was accused of entering into illegal business arrangements with New York criminals in the Genovese crime family. Merlino was also accused of taking part in a massive medical fraud scheme in Florida that had doctors prescribe patients with unnecessary (and ineffective) medical products and billing patients' insurance companies. On August 12, Merlino was released on a $5 million bond. The other 45 men charged in the broad indictment accepted favorable plea bargains and pleaded guilty to reduced charges. Merlino refused any plea offer and went to trial on January 30, 2018. The trial concluded after two weeks of testimony. On February 20, Judge Richard J. Sullivan declared a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on any of the four counts against Merlino. To avoid a retrial, Merlino entered into a plea deal with federal prosecutors on April 27. He agreed to plead guilty to one charge of facilitating illegal gambling transactions via an electronic device in exchange for the U.S. Attorney's Office dropping the remaining charges against him and recommending a prison sentence between 10‚Äì16 months. On October 17, Merlino was sentenced to the maximum of two years in prison. In October 2019, Merlino was granted an early release and moved to a halfway house in to finish the rest of his sentence.

The show was short-lived, with one pilot in 1981 and a series of seven shows in 1982. Background Both women had first met at Manchester Polytechnic in 1970, Wood was hoping to enroll, and Walters was coming to the end of her course. They met again in 1978 when they both appeared in the same revue In at the Death at The Bush Theatre in London. Wood had been initially spotted by Granada's head of drama, Peter Eckersley, performing in her self-written play Talent at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre, who asked her to recreate it for television (his widow is actress Anne Reid, who would appear as Jean in Wood's 1998 sitcom dinnerladies). The TV version of Talent and its sequel Nearly A Happy Ending, would also co-star Walters. Pilot ‚Äì Wood and Walters: Two Creatures Great and Small * Broadcast 1 January 1981 After she had turned down the female role in the satirical sketch show Not The Nine O'Clock News in 1979, Eckersley offered Wood a sketch show of her own in 1980. However, Wood agreed only on the understanding that Walters received equal billing, not feeling confident enough as yet to go it alone. Wood had in fact only ever written one sketch three years earlier before being given her own show. She fell back on songs, which she felt was her strength, the pilot contained four in 30 minutes. The sketches concerned themselves with Marriage Guidance Council, keep fit classes, DIY and gossip. Wood hated the finished result, so was very surprised that the show was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Programme alongside The Two Ronnies, The Kenny Everett Video Show and The Stanley Baxter Series (which won). A third Wood play with Walters was made between the pilot and series for Granada. Like Wood and Walters, Happy Since I Met You also contained an appearance from another long term Wood collaborator Duncan Preston.  Series  * Broadcast 1 January 1982 ‚Äì 21 February 1982 For the series a year later, the 'Two Creatures Great and Small' adjunct had been dropped, as critics commenting on Wood's weight had been beginning to get to her (though she did also say later she was delighted that she was once described as \\"dominating the stage like a witty tank\\"). The show was not a happy experience as, in the intervening time since the pilot, the show's producer (and Wood's mentor) Peter Eckersley had died of cancer. It was a terrible blow to Wood who said \\"he had lots of ideas for the series‚Ä¶but he never told me what they were. His value to me was inestimable. He had a marvellous eye for what was unnecessary and great attention to detail. He had liked the first material for the series but never saw any of the other stuff.\\" Wood was not impressed by his replacement for the series, Brian Armstrong, and was of the opinion that he had hired several unsuitable actors. The studio audience was generally filled with pensioners who often had difficulty understanding Wood's refined humour. Before one sketch, the warm up man had to explain to them what a boutique was. Wood said she heard one disgusted audience member say to her friend: \\"You realise we‚Äôre missing Brideshead for this\\". Sketches for Wood and Walters included * The Woman With 740 Children, in which Wood played a woman who overdosed on a fertility drug. Much to her surprise, Granada hired 70 babies to appear in the sketch. * ‚ÄòGirl Talking‚Äô was an expert parody of social realist documentaries, and * ‚ÄòNortherners‚Äô was a song parodying stereotypes of the North of England. A regular character on the show was Dotty. The items entitled \\"Dotty's Slot\\" featured Walters as Dotty, who performed a witty monologue by a middle-class housewife discussing all matters national and trivial, such as in the sketch ‚ÄòDotty on Women‚Äôs Lib‚Äô. As a character, she shares many similarities with a later Wood creation 'Kitty' (as played by Patricia Routledge). Rik Mayall also appeared in a one- off monologue as a chauvinistic feminist called Mitch, filling a similar guest slot as he had with Kevin Turvey in the sketch show A Kick Up the Eighties. Another alternative comedy innovator to appear on the show was John Dowie, who had already toured with Wood in 1978. Wood's view of the series was \\"Some bits of it were good, some deadly\\". Around this time, Wood made a weekly musical appearance in the BBC Radio 2 show The Little and Large Party, narrated an Arts Council film on the pantomime dame, and was profiled in the schools programme Scene. Walters would also appear with Michael Angelis in 1982 as his wife in Alan Bleasdale's Boys from the Blackstuff. Wood and Walters place in British comedy history can be seen as that of a dry run for the more popular and acclaimed Victoria Wood As Seen on TV which aired on BBC television between 1985 and 1987, which shared some of the same elements such as pseudo- documentaries, songs, sketches, as well as co-starring Walters and Preston. Although consisting of seven episodes, the seventh in the series was a compilation of sketches and songs pulled from the earlier six parts and the pilot. DVD release The series was scheduled for release by Network on numerous occasions from 2006 onwards, only to be cancelled each time. The DVD was eventually released by Network on 18 October 2010. The release included all seven episodes and the original \\"Two Creatures Great and Small\\" pilot episode on a single disc.Wood & Walters ‚Äì Network DVD release  Notes  External links  * BBC Comedy Guide to Wood And Walters * Screenonline on Wood And Walters * *  References  * [1] () * [2] () * [3] () * [4] () * [5] (). * [6] () Category:1981 British television series debuts Category:1982 British television series endings Category:ITV sketch shows Category:ITV comedy Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows produced by Granada Television Category:1980s British television sketch shows ","title":"Wood and Walters"},{"id":"10157404","text":"Galaxi (also Galaxy) is the common name of a series of mass-produced roller coasters manufactured primarily by Italian company S.D.C, which went bankrupt in 1993.

The episode was written by Henry Alonso Myers and directed by Victor Nelli, Jr. Plot Betty and Hilda struggle with a dilemma; Ignacio needs to return to Mexico and apply for his visa so he can re-enter the country legally, and apply for citizenship. However, the cheapest fare they can find is $1200. Betty is also juggling with the task of planning MODE's big assistants week, \\"Administrative Professionals' Day\\", as she prefers to call it, since \\"Secretaries' Day\\" hasn't been used since 1998. Betty has planned the party at a medieval-themed restaurant, aptly called The Middle Ages. While at the cosmetology school, Hilda is having problems with the teacher, who tells Hilda to lose the engagement ring and cut her long nails, since it's an impediment to doing the job. She tells Hilda that she needs to show her commitment to beauty. Later, at MODE, Betty receives a small \\"World's Best Secretary\\" trophy with the word 'secretary' taped over the actual 'notary' word on the trophy. Betty also talks to Daniel about his problems with his sexual addiction and tries to recommend ways for him to seek help. Betty brings in Tyler, a writer for Psychology Now (on the 14th floor), to help him, but Daniel will have none of it, saying that he is not a sex addict. Tyler tries to convince Daniel to go on a sexless date with a model he's seeing that night, after Daniel admits he doesn't remember her last name. After failing with a sexless date, Daniel turns to Tyler afterwards, who admits he was also a sex addict, and passes him some pills to take every time he is tempted to have sex. Everyone is looking forward going to The Middle Ages so they can \\"make fun of the common people\\" as Betty explained to Hilda. Amanda, however, is not interested in going to the event and shows her displeasure by walking around the 28th floor eating other peoples' food and harassing the MODE staff because she isn't a personal assistant. When Marc asked why she wasn't going, Amanda told him how she used to be an actress before she came to work at MODE. After making him promise to never tell anyone, she shows him her acting reel, consisting of a soap opera cameo, a phone chat line commercial, and finally, as a featured performer in the commercial for The Middle Ages (where she was performing as the \\"Serving Wench\\"). Amanda says she can't go there because they play the commercial on a loop near the entrance, and she's afraid the other assistants will make fun of her. But when they arrive, Amanda sees that she's been replaced in the video by a new Serving Wench, who is a younger actress. This upsets Amanda, who goes on an eating binge to take out her anger. Later on in the evening, the young actress sees Amanda, then comes up to her to say her performance is a homage to Amanda's. Meanwhile, Betty tells Christina that she has to get the money for Ignacio's ticket after she gets a call from Hilda, who says Ignacio is flipping out and Betty needs to come home. Betty is going to sign up to ride the mechanical \\"steed\\", but Henry decides he wants to do it for Betty. He is distracted by a phone call from Charlie, whom Henry had been arguing with during the day. As Henry's name is called, he can't hear it, so Betty takes his place and gets on the steed, but as she rides it, and is near to winning the money, Nick, who was upset over Betty taking his yogurt at work earlier in the day, throws an object at her and she is knocked out. When Henry comes to her rescue, he sees Nick laughing and he challenges him to a jousting. Unfortunately, Nick wins and Betty comes to Henry's rescue. Right before Henry passes out he looks at Betty and says \\"I love you.\\" Betty slaps Henry to wake him up, asking him what he said. Charlie shows up and sees Betty comforting Henry. Upset over this, Charlie tells Betty that there's a reason fairy tales don't have two princesses. She is Henry's girlfriend, tells Betty to back off, and takes Henry home. Christina tries to console Betty, who is certain she heard Henry say he loved her, but Betty wonders how he can say that and then choose to leave with Charlie. Christina tells him that he's probably just being honorable and staying with her since she flew 3000 miles to be with him. Betty is upset because she feels like it was so nice to have someone come to her rescue for a change. Christina tells her that she can take care of herself. Nick is bragging to his friends and yells \\"Secretaries' Daaaaaay!\\" Betty responds by sternly correcting him that it is \\"Administrative Professionals Day\\", to which he responds and asks her where her \\"dorko in shining armor\\" is. As he turns around to joke with his friends, Betty takes one of the jousting stalves and whacks Nick hard upside the head, saying \\"I can defend myself!\\" The following day at work Betty gets a lot of respect from everyone at work after putting Nick in his place. The same night of the party, Alexis ponders about whether she should start taking up Rodrigo's offer, as she starts falling hard for him. Seeking advice, she visits Claire at the correctional institution, where she gives her daughter her blessing to follow the man she loves. When Alexis asks Claire about a bruise on her face, Claire says that she got it from \\"Yoga\\", though she doesn't tell Alexis that Yoga is the name of one of the inmates. Later on that evening as Alexis visits Rodrigo, she accidentally picks up his phone and overhears him talking to Bradford about their deal. After Rodrigo returns, she tells him she heard him on the phone with her father. He claims Bradford and he were just talking business, but she tells him she knows Bradford paid Rodrigo to seduce her and get her out of the country. Rodrigo tries to stop her from leaving, but she twists his arm behind his back and tells him that although she may be a woman now, she still knows how to hit like a man. As the door to Rodrigo's hotel room shuts, she collapses, sobbing, on the floor. The next day, Alexis makes a phone call to ask about a problem she needs \\"eliminated\\", as she tears up a picture of Alex and Bradford. Meanwhile, Hilda prepares for her final exam to determine her future at cosmetology school as her teacher criticizes her techniques, which prompts her to quit. But thanks to advice from Justin and Ignacio, she returns to school, faces her teacher for her exam...and she passes! Finally, Wilhelmina prepares for her future plans to take over MODE and Meade Publications, so she also visits Claire at the prison, until Claire threatens her as she now knows about Wilhelmina sleeping with Bradford by looking at her well-done feet. Later in the evening Wilhelmina takes advantage of Claire's threats. To do this, she calls Marc to come to the Meade Building. In the stairwells of the Meade Building, Wilhelmina asks Marc to punch her until she gets bruises so Bradford can divorce Claire and thinking that she's a terrible person. At first, Marc isn't sure about this, until Wilhelmina gets frustrated. Marc still not sure, till Wilhelmina admitted that she is the one who cuts his vacation time, denying him raises for 2 years and finally hacking into his computer and cancelling his subscription to DudeCruse.com!. Marc was angered and punch Wilhemina...very hard. They catsratch each other, which ended when Marc punches Wilhelmina, causing her tumbling down the stairs. The next day, she told what happened to Bradford, with the story that Claire had hire 3 thugs to beat her up. Bradford decided to divorce Clare! At last! The day after the party, Daniel surprises Betty with first class tickets to Mexico for her whole family, saying he was a thoughtless boss. Betty tries to give the tickets back, but Daniel refuses, saying she's always there for other people, and wants to be there for Betty now. Betty is overcome with emotion and thanks Daniel with a hug. After Betty tells the family the good news, a model arrives, and smiles at Daniel, who takes a pill, as it appears that he may have moved on to a new addiction. Production This is the second episode in which stuntperson Anna Mercedes Morris would appear as a stunt double for America Ferrera's character in the scene when Betty was riding the mechanical bull. In addition, viewers hear Henry's last name, Grubstick, for the first time. Also, Lorraine Toussaint starts her recurring role as Amelia \\"Yoga\\" Bluman in this episode. The episode also offered another showcase for actress Becki Newton who was interviewed in TV Guide the week this episode aired.From TV Guide (April 30, 2007) Another clarification would be her character's last name. Originally thought to have been 'Tanner', Amanda's last name is revealed to be 'Tanen', as shown on the computer screen during her acting reel that she shows Marc. In addition, The Middle Ages restaurant commercial is also a reference to Newton appearing in an Olive Garden commercial, which she did before joining \\"Ugly Betty.\\" The Middle Ages is also a spoof of the Medieval Times chain. Reception In a review from Entertainment Weekly, Tanner Stransky wrote \\"Week after week, Ugly Betty continues to top itself. I mean, you gotta love an episode that features an Administrative Professionals Day party at a medieval-themed restaurant in Times Square (complete with a robotic horse); footage of Mandypants (a.k.a. Amanda) as a phone-sex operator, a bar wench, and a slutty nurse; and Claire Meade dishing with her transsexual daughter about the hotness of Brazilian men. It's like the guts of three Lifetime movies smashed together. But witty! And pretty! And addictive!\\" The Recapist also echoed the same sentiments in their review.From The Recapist (May 4, 2007) Ratings The episode was watched by 10.7 million viewers in the United States, an increase from the previous episode.From The Futon Critic (May 4, 2007) ReferencesAlso starring *Judith Light (Claire Meade) *Christopher Gorham (Henry Grubstick) *Jayma Mays (Charlie) *Max Greenfield (Nick Pepper) Guest stars *Cristian de la Fuente (Rodrigo) *Maria Costa (Valerie) *David Noro√±a (Tyler Blake) *Rachel Roberts (Marla) *Shayna Rose (Replacement Serving Wench) *Jonathan Slavin (Squire Josh Weinstock) *Lorraine Toussaint (Yoga) *Joe Duer (Dr. Lorenzo) Category:Ugly Betty (season 1) episodes Category:2007 American television episodes ","title":"Secretaries' Day (Ugly Betty)"},{"id":"10157459","text":"Do Hoang Diem (ƒê·ªó Ho√†ng ƒêi·ªÅm, also known as Diem Do) is the current chairman of pro-democracy Vi·ªát T√¢n.

Background In late 1987, there was a resurgence of interest in Springfield's career, which was a direct result of her work with Pet Shop Boys on the duet \\"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\\", released in November of the same year. The single reached #2 in the US Billboard Hot 100 and #2 in the UK Singles Chart, Springfield's highest simultaneous charting single ever. Springfield then worked with Pet Shop Boys on two further solo singles \\"Nothing Has Been Proved\\", originally from the film Scandal, and \\"In Private\\", both UK Top 20 hits for Springfield in 1989. The culmination of Springfield's new success was the album Reputation, released in 1990. The original album was released only in the UK and reached #18 in the UK Albums Chart, Springfield's first hit album in her native country in over twenty years. 1997 release In 1997, the album was re-released (this time in America as well) as Reputation and Rarities, and included the entire Reputation album, along with two tracks recorded for the album, but never used or released until then, the ballads \\"Any Other Fool\\", written by Diane Warren and Robbie Buchanan, and \\"When Love Turns to Blue\\", a collaboration with British pop duo Climie Fisher. Also included was \\"Getting It Right\\", written and produced by Steve Tyrell in early 1989 for the British movie of the same name, first released as one of the B-sides to the single \\"Reputation\\", and the original 12\\" mix of the biggest hit from the album, \\"In Private\\". Reputation and Rarities was subsequently given a second re-release by EMI's European mid-price label Disky Communications, then repackaged with a third set of cover art. This release, with original 1997 cover art, is the only form of Reputation album available in digital distribution and streaming from Warner Music Group, current holder of album's copyrights.

Built and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, it is used for flood control, recreation, and water supply. El Dorado State Park is located on its shore. History The Flood Control Act of 1965 authorized construction of El Dorado Lake. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers held groundbreaking ceremonies in September 1973, and construction began the following month. The reservoir became fully operational for flood control June 29, 1981. Construction of El Dorado Lake incorporated two pre- existing smaller reservoirs: Bluestem Lake and the original El Dorado Lake. The original El Dorado Lake was built on Satchel Creek in 1927 as a water supply for the community of El Dorado. Bluestem Lake was built on Bemis Creek in the 1950s. The dams of both reservoirs were breached during the building of the larger El Dorado Lake and their waters subsequently inundated. The remnants of Bluestem Lake's dam are still visible in the Shady Creek arm of the present-day reservoir. Geography El Dorado Lake is located at (37.8472402, -96.8230838) at an elevation of . It lies in the Flint Hills in south-central Kansas. The entirety of the reservoir lies within Butler County. The reservoir is impounded at its southwestern end by El Dorado Lake Dam. The Walnut River is both the reservoir's primary inflow from the north and outflow to the southwest. Smaller tributaries include: Gilmore Branch and Cole Creek from the north, Durechen Creek from the northeast, and Satchel Creek, Bemis Creek, and Shady Creek from the east. The Kansas Turnpike (Interstate 35) runs northeast-southwest across the northern end of the lake and then parallel to its northwestern shore. U.S. Route 77 runs north-south west of the reservoir, and U.S. Route 54 runs east-west south of the reservoir. Kansas Highway 177 runs north-south across the lake's eastern arms. Boulder Bluff Road, a paved county road, runs around the dam to the south, connecting with Shady Creek Access Road, another paved county road, which runs east-west immediately south of the reservoir. The reservoir's namesake, the city of El Dorado, is located just southwest of the dam. Hydrography The surface area, surface elevation, and water volume of the reservoir fluctuate based on inflow and local climatic conditions. In terms of capacity, the Corps of Engineers vertically divides the reservoir into a set of pools based on volume and water level, and the reservoir is considered full when filled to the capacity of its conservation pool. When full, El Dorado Lake has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . When filled to maximum capacity, it has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . The streambed underlying the reservoir has an elevation of . Infrastructure El Dorado Lake Dam is a rolled earth-fill embankment dam that stands above the streambed and long. At its crest, the dam has an elevation of . An uncontrolled, spillway is located near the northwest end of the dam. Additional outlet works include an by oval conduit. The estimated peak discharge capacity is . Management The Tulsa District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the dam and reservoir. The Corps has licensed the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism (KDWP) to develop and manage approximately of land around the reservoir as El Dorado State Park and another of land as the El Dorado Wildlife Area. The KDWP also manages boating on the reservoir surface and local fisheries. Parks and recreation El Dorado State Park is divided into four areas spread around the shore of the southern portion of the reservoir: the Bluestem Point Area is located between the reservoir's two eastern arms; the Boulder Bluff Area lies along the western shore; the Shady Creek Area is located on the south shore of the reservoir's southeastern arm; the Walnut River Area lies immediately southwest of the dam. All four areas include boat ramps, camping facilities, and hiking trails. In addition, the Bluestem Point Area hosts a bait shop and a swimming beach, a marina operates in the Shady Creek Area, and the Walnut River Area includes an amphitheater and swimming pond. El Dorado Lake is open for sport fishing. Hunting is permitted in the El Dorado Wildlife Area as well as on of land in El Dorado State Park. Wildlife Fish species resident in El Dorado Lake include blue and channel catfish, rainbow trout, walleye, white bass, white crappie, and wiper. Two invasive species, the white perch and the zebra mussel, live in the lake as well. Game animals living on land around the reservoir include beavers, bobcats, coyotes, deer, doves, pheasants, prairie chickens, quail, rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, and turkeys.

It starts off at Aberdeen Avenue as a two-way street going through the Locke Street shopping district up to Main Street where it then becomes a one-way street until it crosses King Street and becomes two-way again going north past Victoria Park and ends just past Barton Street West on Tecumseh Street, a road that winds West and leads to the back-end of Dundurn Park. History thumb Canadian Pacific Railway, view from overpass bridge, Locke Street South Locke Street South, walking tour Locke Street South, walking tour Locke Street South, walking tour Locke Street South, walking tour Locke Street South, walking tour St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church Melrose United Church The origins of Locke Street's name can be traced back as early as 1840, when it was spelled \\"Lock\\"; by 1870 the spelling was standardized to \\"Locke.\\" North of King Street West was known as Railway Street because it ran to the Great Western Railway yards. Locke Street North is mostly residential and in the 1800s most of the homes there belonged to the railway workers and their families. Locke Street is a \\"street of churches\\" and a \\"hub for antique shops.\\" The early churches were founded as follows: * 1886: Locke Street Presbyterian Church * 1891: Saint John the Evangelist Anglican Church * 1893: Saint Joseph's Roman Catholic Church * 1897: Immanuel Congregational Church * 1897: Herkimer Street Baptist Church Prior to 1853, just south of Herkimer Street on Locke was the site of the Beasley Racetrack. The racetrack was named after its owner and operator Richard Beasley (1761‚Äì1842), who was a soldier, political figure, farmer and businessman. It was a popular spot featuring both trotting and steeplechase racing. Just off Locke near Charlton, the Hamilton Amateur Athletic Association Grounds is a park that was home to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats from 1872‚Äì1949. Today it is also the site of the Hamilton Tennis Club. Before it was used for football, the park was the site of a cricket club, and in 1860 a racquet club was established near the present site of the Hamilton Tennis Club. In 1870, Locke South was described as a \\"sparsely populated mud track.\\" Despite rapid expansion of the city, Locke Street South was still an isolated area. On the other hand, Locke Street North continued with its residential growth and the development of Victoria Park and the opening of the Crystal Palace. The Crystal Palace opened up at Victoria Park on 20 September 1860 by Edward, Prince of Wales (who later became King Edward VII). It was home to the area's largest fall fair (agriculture exhibition) for many years. The Hamilton Herald reported on 22 September 1890 that \\"The Carnival of Venice, The Paris Exposition or the World's Fair in Chicago will be nowhere tomorrow when the great Central Fair is opened at the Crystal Palace Grounds in this city.\\" The structure was demolished in 1891. By 1885, Locke Street South began to grow, after a brick sewer was constructed and gas lines were laid. In 1889, Wesley Vollick, a cabinet maker, built a small brick cottage that in 1924 became the Locke Street Library. In 1890, The Hamilton Street Railway (HSR) built its western terminus on the northeast corner of Locke & Herkimer Streets. A two-storey tram building and horse barn which could accommodate up to 42 horses and 12 tram cars. As well, the Hamilton- Dundas Electric Railway line, nicknamed the \\"Dundas Dummy\\", travelled along Aberdeen Avenue and crossed over Locke Street South. In 2000, Locke Street South celebrated its 150th anniversary. In March 2018 a small group of people vandalized businesses on Locke Street in response to gentrification in Hamilton. Festivals Locke Street has festivals held throughout the year. One is called Spring Blooms on Locke, an annual festival that marks the end of winter and is also a fundraiser for sick children. The Locke Street Festival where each September the street is closed off for a day with live entertainment, street vendors, and food. The Christmas Open House celebrates the holidays with businesses open late, food, drink, and carollers each November.

He was convicted of four counts of rape in 2010 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He escaped in March 2013, and remained at large for several months, until he was killed by villagers on 29 August 2013. Early life Tari was born on Manus Island in 1971. He studied to become a Lutheran minister at Amron Bible College in Madang, but left the school prematurely after rejecting the teachings of the Bible, leaving behind both his clothing and his belongings. He retreated into the mountain village of Gal, where he formed a personality cult around himself as the Messiah, adopting the moniker \\"Black Jesus\\". Cult leader Tari's cult, which is estimated to have numbered as many as 6,000, became notorious for its alleged use of \\"flower girls\\" who served as concubines for Tari. The girls dress in scant clothing. The Lutheran Church, very prominent in Papua New Guinea, declared Tari an \\"enemy of the church\\". Tari was pursued by Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary police in 2005 as a result of his teachings. The first rape/murder accusation against Tari involves the fate of Rita Herman, who joined the cult at age 13 as a personal \\"flower girl\\" of the self-styled messiah. According to accusations, in October 2006, Tari and a select circle of his ex-Lutheran aides, along with Barmarhal Herman, the girl's mother and reported \\"queen\\" of the flower girls, took 14-year-old Rita into a private tent where she was raped by Tari. Barmarhal instructed her daughter to submit, as she and her family would be blessed by Tari and would receive great gifts of material goods and wealth as reward for the ritual. After the rape, Tari killed the girl with multiple knife stabs. Barmarhal's other daughter had been previously jailed for being one of Tari's flower girls. Barmarhal has denied being present at the event. Tari was initially captured in 2005, but escaped prior to his trial with the help of a Lutheran pastor, Logan Sapus, who had been assigned to counsel him but became converted to Tari's cult instead. Back in the jungle, Tari cultivated an honour guard and recruited a new crop of flower girls from the remote villages, promising them blessings of wealth in exchange. Tari enlisted only virgins, reportedly some as young as 8 years old. About 50 of Tari's followers, including about 30 flower girls, were rounded up in an operation in June 2006. Those followers publicly renounced Tari and reconciled with their churches. Capture, escape and death In 2007, Tari was captured after rival villagers traveled into his mountain stronghold at Matepi village, in the Transgogol area of Madang Province, and attacked and captured him. One of the villagers climbed into a tree to obtain a cellphone signal and called the authorities. Tari's appearance in court was delayed due to the injuries he suffered in that assault. He appeared in court in October 2007 charged with sexual offences. The claims of murder were never tested in court. He argued in his defence that \\"Those women were flower-girls and this was the work of the minister and permitted by the religion. And I don‚Äôt know if the charges laid against me are wrong or right.\\" Because he had no legal representation the trial was adjourned until December. He was held in Madang's Beon Prison. In April 2010 it was reported that Tari again attempted escape from custody but was caught quickly afterwards. In October 2010 he was found guilty of four counts of rape, and sentenced to twenty years in prison.Ilya Gridneff, Papua New Guinea Correspondent, \\"PNG's Black Jesus guilty of rape\\", The Sunday Morning Herald, 8 October 2010. On 21 March 2013, Tari escaped with 40 other prisoners in a mass breakout from Beon Prison Camp. On 31 August, police reported that Tari had been killed by the villagers in Gal, a small Madang village, two days earlier, allegedly after murdering a local woman.\\"Angry PNG villagers kill 'Black Jesus' cult leader\\", Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 30 August 2013 An investigation is pending, although national newspapers have reported that Tari was \\"chopped to death\\" by the angry villagers.

Design and development Its design was derived from the Aeronca C-2. Introduced in 1931, it featured room for a passenger seated next to the pilot. Powered by a new Aeronca E-113 engine, the seating configuration made flight training much easier and many Aeronca owners often took to the skies with only five hours of instruction‚Äîlargely because of the C-3's predictable flying characteristics. Both the C-2 and C-3 are often described as ‚Äúpowered gliders‚Äù because of their gliding ability and gentle landing speeds. Aeronca C-3 at the Museu Asas de Um Sonho 1931 Aeronca C-3 taken at Airventure 2013, Oshkosh, WI The C-3's distinctive razorback design was drastically altered in 1935 with the appearance of the ‚Äúroundback‚Äù C-3 Master. Retaining the tubular fuselage frame construction, the C-3 Master featured a smaller vertical stabilizer and rudder with a ‚Äúfilled out‚Äù fuselage shape that created the new ‚Äúroundback‚Äù appearance and improved the airflow over the tail. With an enclosed cabin (brakes and wing light still cost extra), the 1935 C-3 Master was priced at only $1,895Payne, Stephen, ed. Canadian Wings (Douglas & McIntyre, Ltd., 2006), p.163.‚Äîjust a few hundred dollars more than the primitive C-2 of 1930.Payne, p.163. The low price generated significant sales; 128 C-3 Masters were built in 1935 alone (of 430 C-3s built in all),Of those, only 20 were exported to Canada. Payne, p.163. and the 500th Aeronca aircraft also rolled off the assembly line that same year. A version of the C-3 with fabric-covered ailerons (instead of metal), designated the Aeronca 100, was built in England under license by Light Aircraft Ltd. (operating as Aeronautical Corporation of Great Britain Ltd.) but the expected sales never materialized‚Äîonly 24 British- built aircraft were manufactured before production was halted. Production of the C-3 was halted in 1937 when the aircraft no longer met new U.S. government standards for airworthiness. Many of the C-3's peculiarities‚Äîa strictly external wire-braced wing with no wing struts directly connecting the wing panels with the fuselage, extensive fabric construction, single-ignition engine, and lack of an airspeed indicator‚Äîwere no longer permitted. Fortunately for the legion of Aeronca owners, a ‚Äúgrandfather‚Äù clause in the federal regulations allowed their airplanes to continue flying, although they could no longer be manufactured.

It differed significantly from other Aeronca planes by the use of radial engines, streamlining, and a cantilever low wing.Harris, Richard, \\"Aeronca: Birth of the Personal Plane,\\" AAHS Journal, Summer 2007, vol.52, #2, American Aviation Historical Society Harris, Richard, \\"Aeronca/Champion History: Beyond the Bathtub -- Chiefs, Champs & Citabrias,\\" from articles first appearing in In Flight USA, 2003-2004, condensed on author's website, retrieved Jan. 31, 2016. Design and construction Quite unlike other Aeronca designs, the Model L was a \\"cantilever\\" (no external struts for bracing) low-wing monoplane, that featured side-by-side seating in a completely enclosed cabin. The design reflected the greater attention being paid to aerodynamics in the period, including large wheel spats for the fixed undercarriage and a Townend ring for the engine. The aircraft was of mixed-construction with a welded steel fuselage and wings with spruce spars and ribs, all covered with fabric. Initial attempts to use Aeronca's own engines proved inadequate, and the company turned to small radial engines from other suppliers‚Äîparticularly neighboring Cincinnati engine manufacturer LeBlond. Operational history The Model L was mainly flown by private pilot owners. The plane was not a big seller. Difficulty with engine sources, and a destructive flood, in 1937, at Aeronca's factory at Cincinnati's Lunken Airport, took the energy out of the program, and Aeronca went back to high-wing light aircraft. (With the end of sales to Aeronca, LeBlond sold their engine-manufacturing operation to an Aeronca-rival planemaker, Kansas City-based Rearwin Aircraft, who resumed production of the engines under the brand name \\"Ken-Royce,\\" largely for use in Rearwin planes).

Consumed with fury and wrath at his failure to procure a permanent apprentice, he electrocutes the bodies of the two failed apprentices with Force Lightning. A comparison of the storyboards, raw footage, and final frames Production Macomber and Thomas originally produced Duel as an acting/choreography demo for an actor, but felt they could make a better film with CG stages, as opposed to the location work on the original. The cast consists of three actors, two of whom are the creators. The script was first written by Thomas, with Macomber devising the fight. After about 14 months of pre-planning, filming took place at Alamo Studios in Santa Barbara, California, in September 2000. Post-production was split between Thomas and Macomber. Thomas primarily handled the digital backgrounds and 3D animation, while Macomber handled compositing and the lightsaber effects. The final version took four months of post-production, using off-the-shelf software from Electric Image, Adobe, and Apple, and about in out-of-pocket costs. Soundtrack The first cut of the film featured music and sound effects taken from Star Wars films, but a later release had all-new music by Alan Derian. Reception Reaction to Duality was mostly positive, generating over a half million downloads in its first year of release. Entertainment Weekly said its effects \\"have the impressive digital sheen of Episode I\\", while IFILM programming director said the film \\"absolutely blew me away, and a lot of people out there are saying this is the best they've ever come across.\\" The film showed that film-level special effects could be produced by the common fan. Macomber and Thomas said they had \\"taken a few calls\\" from Hollywood effects houses after the film premiered. Not every reaction was positive though. Various members of the Star Wars fan films community felt that it was short on story and featured dated special effects when compared to other fan films, and that the trollish behavior of Mark Thomas leading up to its release forever tainted the product. In August 2010, Time magazine's online visitors listed it at no. 7 on their list of the top 10 Star Wars fan films.

His style is similar to that of American artists Haring, Basquiat, Scharf and incorporates influences from graffiti and comic books. Di Rosa is a key figure in the \\"Figuration Libre\\" movement of French painters.

In August 2006 he had a show of his work at the Bass Museum in Miami. He shows regularly with the Gallery Haim-Chanin in New York and Louis Carre et Cie. in Paris.  Controversy  In April 2019, controversy arose over a 1991 Di Rosa mural at the French Parliament which features two stereotypical blackface figures. The mural, meant to commemorate the 1794 abolition of slavery in France, was characterized as humiliating and dehumanizing by Mame-Fatou Niang of Carnegie Mellon and the French author Julien Suaudeau who launched a petition calling for the mural's removal. The mural had come to Niang‚Äôs attention when it was tweeted to her by a French schoolgirl. Di Rosa responded to the criticism saying ‚ÄúThese two people allow themselves to accuse me of racism [and] have the nerve to act as spokespeople for the millions of victims [of slavery] and want to censor the work,‚Äù and accepted no responsibility for any offense caused by the work nor acknowledged that it could even be honestly perceived as racist.

Design and development The Aeronca 7 Champion line‚Äîdeveloped in the mid-1940s as a post-World War II response to the popular Piper J-3 Cub‚Äîuses similar design features (already featured in Aeronca's wartime designs, the Aeronca Model T, Aeronca Defender, and Aeronca L-3), but also incorporates aspects of traditional Aeronca designs, including the internal main trusswork of the fuselage frame. Like its predecessors and initial rivals, the high-wing, two-seat plane has tandem seating, conventional landing gear (tailwheel-equipped), and a small piston engine.Sargent, Sparky Barnes, \\"A Honey of a Champion! The Baker family's award-winning Aeronca,\\" Vintage Airplane, Dec., 2007, vol.35, #12, Experimental Aircraft Association As with many light aircraft of the time, the Champ's fuselage and tail surfaces are constructed of welded metal tubing. The outer shape of the fuselage is created by a combination of wooden formers and longerons, covered with fabric. The cross-section of the metal fuselage truss is triangular, a design feature which can be traced all the way back to the earliest Aeronca C-2 design of the late 1920s. The strut-braced wings of the Champ are, like the fuselage and tail surfaces, fabric-covered, and use aluminum ribs. Most Champs were built with wooden spars. American Champion has been using aluminum spars in the aircraft it has produced, and has also made the aluminum-spar wings available for retrofit installation on older aircraft. Like the Piper Cub with which it competed, the Champ features tandem seating. However, while the J-3 model of the Cub is flown solo from the rear seat, the Champ can be soloed from the front, giving improved forward visibility, particularly on the ground and during takeoffs, landings, and climbs. The Champ offers far better visibility than the Cub, allowing 300 degrees of visibility to a front-seated pilot, and has a wider cabin than the Cub.Karant, Max, \\"Flying Check Pilot: The Aeronca Chief ,\\" Flying Magazine, Dec., 1946. Additionally, an uncommon Champ variant‚Äîthe 7HC‚Äîwas produced with an enlarged rear seat allowing 2 passengers to be carried. The landing gear of most Champs is in a conventional arrangement, though two variants with tricycle gear were produced, and a model with reversed tricycle gear was tried. Conventional-gear Champs feature a steerable tailwheel and most have steel tube main gear which use an oleo strut for shock absorption. One variant utilized sprung-steel main gear, and American Champion uses aluminum gear legs in its production model of the Champ. Tricycle-gear Champs use the steel tube and oleo strut main gear, mating these with an oleo strut nose gear. Models 7AC, 7CCM, 7DC, and 7EC were approved as floatplanes, with the addition of floats and vertical stabilizer fins; the floatplane versions were designated the S7AC, S7CCM, S7DC, and S7EC, respectively. The 7GC and 7HC may also be operated with floats but are not given a special designation in this configuration. All floatplane versions have increased gross weights over the corresponding landplanes.Aircraft Specification A-759 2011, pp. 3‚Äì7. Operational history Built by Aeronca Aircraft Corporation, the Champ first flew in 1944, and entered production in 1945. As an economical postwar rival to the Piper Cub (which it largely improved upon), the Champ was popular with training schools who were training veterans returning from World War II, by the thousands, with government funding through the G.I. Bill.Smith, Frank Kingston, \\"The Turbulent Decade,\\" (history of U.S. aviation from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s), Flying Magazine 50th Anniversary Edition, September 1977, pp.200‚Äì208; as photocopied at Google Books, retrieved Feb. 2016. The original model 7AC Champion initially sold by the thousands, peaking in 1946, as Aeronca developed the highest-volume production line in general aviation. Between 1946 and 1947, Aeronca was producing an average 30 light aircraft per day (peaking at 50 per day at one point). But 1946 was a momentary explosion in lightplane production, industry-wide. The postwar boom-and-bust of the late 1940s and early 1950s brought an abrupt end to the massive sales, and‚Äîlike the rest of the U.S. lightplane industry‚ÄîAeronca production dropped to a small fraction of 1946‚Äì1947 sales. Engine upgrades in 1947, 1948 and 1949 resulted in the Models 7BCM, 7DC and the electric-system-equipped 7EC, all distinguished from the 7AC by a larger vertical tail than predecessors, to compensate for the greater torque and p-factor of the larger engines. Some of these Champ variants were acquired by the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) and its successor, the U.S. Air Force (USAF), particularly for use by the U.S. Army Ground Forces and the National Guard, as replacements for the Piper L-4 variant of the Piper Cub, used as an observation and liaison aircraft. The Aeronca Champ military variants were labeled L-16, L-16A and L-16B.Air Training Department, The Artillery School, U.S. Army, \\"The New Grasshopper‚ÄîL-16,\\" (semi-official U.S. Army tutorial written to guide pilots transitioning from the Piper L-4 to the Aeronca L-16) The Field Artillery Journal, Nov‚ÄìDec 1947, United States Army, By the time production ended in 1951, the company had sold more than 8,000 Champions, mostly 7AC Champs (approx. 7,200). Aeronca ceased all production of light aircraft in 1951, and the Champ design was sold in 1954 to Champion Aircraft, who continued production of some of the more advanced variants of the Champ, from the 1950s into the early 1960s‚Äîgradually modifying them into the aerobatic Champion Citabria. Champion Aircraft was acquired in 1970 by Bellanca Aircraft which continued production of their Champ-derived Citabria and Decathlon designs. In 1971, Bellanca introduced the 7ACA version of the Champ as a more basic complement to their other designs, as the least expensive, and lowest-performance, commercially produced light plane on the market at the time.,\\"1971 Aircraft Directory,\\" Flying Annual & Pilots' Guide, 1971 ed., special section [Ziff-Davis], NY Only a handful of 7ACA's were built between 1971 and 1972. Bellanca ceased all production in the early 1980s. Jabiru powered prototype American Champion Aircraft Corporation acquired the Champ and related designs in 1989. In 2001, they were rumored to be considering a reintroduction of the Champ design as a 7EC powered by a Jabiru Aircraft engine. While a test version was flown, this combination was not put into production. With the creation of the light-sport aircraft (LSA) category of aircraft in the United States by the FAA, American Champion in late 2007 began producing a revised version of the 7EC powered by the Continental O-200-A. The new production aircraft are type certified, but also qualify to be flown by sport pilots in the United States. Although the fuselage and cowling contours are similar to the original-production models, the new aircraft used the windows, interior, door, and windscreen of the modern Citabria. Fuel capacity was reduced to to conserve weight; despite this measure and various others, such as the use of aluminum landing gear legs and bare birch floorboards rather than carpet, the aircraft's payload is inadequate to carry two adults and full fuel simultaneously. The manufacturer was considering various further weight-reduction measures including the use of the lightened Continental O-200D engine previously offered in the Cessna 162 Skycatcher. However, the revived 7EC was dropped from production by mid 2019. Standard-production 7AC, 7BCM (L-16A), 7CCM (L-16B), 7DC, and 7ACA models qualify as U.S. Light Sport Aircraft. Only those specific original-production 7EC airplanes certificated at a gross weight qualify for the LSA category; a standard original-production 7EC is certificated at a gross weight of and does not qualify. Variants Various versions of the Champ have been tested and produced since 1944, including military, aerobatic, cropduster, tricycle-gear and (as the 402 Lancer) a twin-engined variant. The derivative Citabria designs ‚Äî models 7ECA, 7GCAA, 7GCBC, and 7KCAB ‚Äî are discussed in a separate article, as is the twin-engined 402 Lancer. Floatplane variants are designated by an \\"S\\" prefix and are discussed together with the standard respective land variant. 7AC Champion Aeronca 7AC Champion Introduced in 1945, the 7AC Champion (\\"Champ\\") was the first (and, by far, the most popular) version of the design.

A supplemental type certificate allows the installation of a Lycoming O-235.Aircraft Specification A-759 2011, p. 1 and p. 23. The Champ featured a conventional landing gear configuration, with shock absorption in the main gear provided by oleo struts. The aircraft had no electrical system. It is distinguishable from nearly all other variants by the absence of a dorsal fin at the leading edge of the vertical tail (most later models had the enlarged tail). Approximately 7,200 were built between 1945 and 1948‚Äîfar outnumbering all other subsequent variants combined, and far outnumbering most rival designs of the period. Some were acquired by the U.S. military and designated L-16‚Äînot to be confused with the L-16A and L-16B derived from later Champ variants.

The last Champ produced at Aeronca was a 7EC, and when Champion reintroduced the Champ in 1955, it was with their version of the 7EC, very little changed from Aeronca's. An enhanced version called the Champion DeLuxe Traveler offered a metal propeller with spinner, wheel pants, a steerable tailwheel, and navigation lights. 773 7EC aircraft were produced during the original production run. In late 2007, American Champion introduced a revised version of the 7EC, featuring the Continental O-200-A engine of .Aircraft Specification A-759 2011, p. 37. Differing in a number of ways from earlier 7ECs, this new version in particular replaced the wood-spar wings of the earlier versions with a metal-spar wing and used aluminum gear legs. To fit within the Light Sport requirements, the maximum weight was reduced to 1,320 pounds (599 kilograms). The aircraft was discontinued by mid 2019. 7FC Tri-Traveler Champion 7FC Tri-Traveller In 1957, Champion brought out the 7FC, which is similar to the 7EC but with tricycle landing gear instead of conventional (tailwheel) gear, oleo struts on all 3 wheels, and extra frame bracing for the nosewheel. Factory standard equipment was comparable to the 7EC DeLuxe Traveler. The 7FC is slower and heavier than an equivalent 7EC, with a standard useful load of , compared with for the 7EC; both use the Continental C90-12F engine.

Full-back Although playing with a suspect knee for his last few seasons at Richmond, Swift always gave his best; and, considering his knee problems, he had a surprising turn of speed. He ended his career at full-back, having played as a half-forward flanker and ruck-rover for his last few seasons, and only moving to full-back in the last half of his last season, in place of the injured Mick Erwin. Jack Dyer had suggested the move, on the basis of his own experience with a similar sort of knee injury, Dyer argued that, of all the positions on the field, full-back was the best for Swift, because he would have almost all of his play in front of him, and almost all of his running would be straight ahead, with a minimum of turns and sideways movement. In his first full match in 1967 at full-back, in round 16 (16 August 1967), against Hawthorn, at Glenferrie Oval, despite fears that he was too short to play against Hawthorn's champion full- forward, Peter Hudson, who was 3¬Ω inches taller,Carter, R., \\"Fred Swift gets full-back job in Richmond Side\\", The Age, (Friday, 11 August 1967), p.22. Swift held Hudson to three goals, and Richmond won the match, thrashing Hawthorn 23.30 (168) to 7.12 (54). 1967 VFL Grand Final In his final game, the 1967 Grand Final against Geelong,Along with Kevin Bartlett, and John Northey, Swift had played in every one of the twenty matches that the Richmond senior team played in the 1967 season. he not only captained his team to a premiership, but he was one of the best on the ground, somewhat nullifying the impact of the temperamental Geelong hairdresser and champion full-forward, Doug Wade, who was nearly five inches (11 cm) taller and more than two stone heavier (14 kg), and was widely expected to out-class Swift.Beames, P., \\"Wade's Big Chance\\", The Age, (Saturday, 23 September 1963), p.20. Wade, the season's top goal-kicker, who had scored 79 goals during the home-and-away section of the season (including 6 goals against Swift, and Richmond, in round 18), and 8 and 5 goals in the semi-final and preliminary finals against Collingwood and Carlton respectively, was clearly outplayed in the Grand Final, and was held to just 4 goals by Swift. Although Geelong was the first to score, Richmond was a goal in front by quarter time: 4.3 (27) to 3.3 (21). By half time, Richmond had increased its lead to 16 points: 9.10 (64) to 7.6 (48). Geelong fought back during the third quarter and, at one stage, led by 14 points; however, Richmond counter-attacked and the scores were level. And, then, two rushed behinds right at the end of the quarter, saw Richmond two points ahead at three-quarter time: 12.15 (87) to 13.7 (85). In one of the most exciting last quarters ever, Richmond was in front, then scores were level, then Geelong was in front, then scores were level, then Richmond was in front, then scores were level; and then it was time on. Richmond's John Ronaldson kicked a goal (his third for the match) to put Richmond six points ahead, and then a goal from Kevin Bartlett, backing out of the pack, increased Richmond's lead to twelve points. Geelong then ferociously surged back into the game when \\"Polly\\" Farmer (playing his last game for Geelong) handpassed the ball to Wayne Closter, who kicked the ball goal-wards towards Wade (Geelong's no.10) somewhere between centre-half forward and full-forward. An almost exhausted Swift (Richmond's no.15; and, as always, with the 5 askew), with great anticipation, leapt high in front of Wade and palmed the ball away to his right from in front of the pack. He raced back towards the goal square, just in time to intercept a kick from Colin Eales and, to add insult to injury, ran across the face of goal, bounced the ball, with Wade in hot pursuit, and calmly passed the ball to John Perry. Both Tony Polinelli and Bill Ryan kicked poorly, each scoring a behind, placing Geelong ten points behind; and then, with plenty of time for Geelong to get another goal, and breaking out of a pack, Goggin punt-kicked what seemed certain to be a goal (which would have reduced the lead to a dangerous four points). The tenacious Swift ‚Äì already greatly tired from having to captain his team, counteract the stronger, heavier, and taller Wade, and kick the ball back into play after the eight behinds that Geelong had scored up to that moment in the last quarter), single-mindedly concentrating on his task, took one of the finest marks of his career at the Punt Road end of the M.C.G. With the strong September afternoon sun shining directly into his eyes, without any opposition (with the goal umpire crouching in a perfect position to determine its legality), he first caught the ball perhaps ten feet above the ground (3m), right on the goal line, to turn Geelong away, and retain Richmond's lead of ten points. He played on, and his clearing drop-kick almost hit the centre. Moments later, Polinelli surged up the ground kicked Geelong's ninth behind for the quarter; and, as Polinelli's kick went through, the siren sounded, with Richmond finally winning by nine points 16.18 (114) to 15.15 (105). Retirement from Richmond Immediately after the Grand Final, he announced his retirement.Beames, P., \\"Fred Swift bows out with a flag\\", The Age, (Monday, 25 September 1967), p.32. In the following week, Swift was made the Lord Mayor of Richmond City for the day; and a photograph appeared in the Melbourne press, entitled \\"The day Richmond belonged to him\\", with Swift, in full mayoral regalia, looking down over the City of Richmond from the roof of the Richmond Town Hall.A copy of the press photograph, most likely taken from the Melbourne Herald, appears at Richmond did all it could to induce Swift's to stay in the following week, but he was adamant that he would not change his mind, and they parted on friendly terms.Carter, R., \\"Swift Determined\\", The Age, (Wednesday, 27 September 1967), p.22. It is also significant to note that, although Swift tasted success as the captain of a premiership team, coached by Tom Hafey (who had played beside Swift in the Richmond first eighteen in the 1957 and 1958 seasons), in his last season with Richmond, he had also experienced Richmond being far from successful for most of his career; and, when examined year by year, Swift's career of 146 senior games clearly shows the extent to which he (and Richmond) had experienced hard times: 1958 season, he played 16 senior games (Richmond was 10th, out of 12 teams, at the end of the home-and-away season); 1959, 7 games (11th); 1960, 18 games (last); 1961, 15 games (10th) (in round 16, Swift played in the centre of a Richmond team that was beaten by St Kilda 12.19 (91) to 0.8 (8),Balfe, N., \\"One-Horse Race at St KiIda\\", The Age, (Monday, 14 August 1961), p.20. the first time that a senior VFL team had failed to score a goal since round 11, 1921); 1962, 18 games (8th); 1963, 12 games (10th); 1964, 18 games (9th); 1965, 17 games (5th); 1966, 5 games (5th); 1967, 18 games (first), plus the second semi-final and the Grand-Final (premiers). Coaching career In his own time with Sandhurst, he had been coached by former Hawthorn rover, by then playing as a ruckman, Kevin Curran, and by former North Melbourne wingman, Leo Francis. At Richmond he had been coached by Alan McDonald, Des Rowe, Len Smith, Jack Titus, and Tom Hafey. In 1968, Swift was appointed captain-coach of the Corowa Football Club. Under Swift's guidance the team, which had taken the wooden spoon in 1967, went on to win the premiership in 1968 from fourth position.‚Äô68 Spiders to mark triumph, The Border Mail, (1 July 2008).

After football After his time with the Kennington/Strathdale Football Club he moved back to the Bendigo area and took up farming. Murder Swift was murdered on Thursday, 28 April 1983, when two robbers, Robert William Larson (born 13 March 1965) of Ophir Street, Bendigo, and Malcolm David Lee, of Violet Street, Bendigo, armed with a sawn-off .22 calibre rifle and disguised with balaclavas, invaded his farm (located at Lockwood, 10 km southwest of Bendigo) around mid-day whilst he was absent from home. They had chosen to rob Swift's property in order to supplement their unemployment benefits.News in Brief: The State, The Age, (13 December 1983), p.2. According to the account of Tom Hafey, a former Richmond team-mate, a former Richmond coach, and a long-time friend of Swift, \\"The kids [who killed him] knew the layout of the house. Fred used to take them fishing\\".Masters, R., \\"The Peter Pan of Australian Rules takes a dip in Rugby League waters\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, (29 May 1990), p.46. They tied up his wife (Anita Charlotte Swift) and son (Paul Andrew Swift) and began ransacking the house. Swift arrived home soon after Larson and Lee's invasion; he got out of his car, went into the house to investigate, confronted the two, and was shot in the heart and in the thigh. He died almost immediately from his wounds. His body was not moved until nearly 6 pm that afternoon. His murderers escaped in Swift's car. Larson was identified by Paul Swift (who had first met Larson two years earlier); and, despite Larson's disguise, Paul was able to identify him by his voice, his eyes, his build, and his clothing. Paul also identified Larson as the one who had been armed with the sawn-off .22 calibre rifle. The police immediately set up road blocks, and began to search the surrounding area. Soon Swift's car was found abandoned in bushland several kilometres from the scene of the murder. The police arrested both of his murderers late that afternoon.Supreme Court of Victoria, 1984 VR.Thwaites, T. & Carman, G., \\"VFL great Fred Swift shot dead\\", The Age, (Friday, 29 April 1983), p.1. Jack Dyer's eulogy on World of Sport At the time of Swift's death, the entire football community was deeply shocked. On the morning of the following Sunday (1 May 1983), Ron Casey, host of the television programme World of Sport, without any prior warning, unexpectedly asked one of the show's stars, the sports journalist, Richmond legend, former Richmond coach, and Richmond selector Jack Dyer, who had been responsible for suggesting Swift's move to full-back in 1967 in place of Mick Erwin, to deliver what amounted to a eulogy. Dyer refused outright, and a very fierce argument broke out between Casey and Dyer; with Casey's will, as host of the programme, prevailing. Many of the viewers, already deeply upset at the murder of such a brave, honest, courageous, and well-loved man apparently killed in defence of his family, were further affected by the mournful manner in which Dyer, who deeply respected and admired Swift, spoke. It was only later revealed that the reason for Dyer's initial refusal to speak on air, and his actual refusal to look into the camera whilst speaking ‚Äì having been forced against his will, by Casey, to deliver the eulogy ‚Äì was solely due to his having left his false teeth at home (a fact that he refused to reveal to Casey or anyone else at the time), and had nothing to do with any reluctance to acknowledge his own personal sense of great loss at Swift's murder.Palmer, S., \\"A Legend Written in Blood\\", Sunday Herald Sun, (24 August 2003), p.60: Jack Dyer's obituary, written by Scott Palmer. Murder trial On Monday, 2 May 1983, both Larson and Lee were charged with Swift's murder. They were also charged with the unlawful imprisonment of Anita Charlotte Swift and Paul Andrew Swift, and having committed a robbery while armed with a rifle.Murder Charges, The Age Tuesday, 3 May 1983, p.3, col.B. Prior to the trial, the unlawful imprisonment charges were dropped, and both men were charged with murder and both were charged with armed robbery. According to the trial transcript (VR 559, p. 564) a clinical psychologist, Bernard Healey, had comprehensively tested Larson in May 1983 and found \\"that Larson [had] an I.Q. of 80, which [placed] him at the lowest end of the dull range of intelligence and at about 9 per centum amongst people of his age\\". In November 1983, a jury found Larson guilty of murder and armed robbery, and found Lee guilty of manslaughter and armed robbery; they were sentenced, by Mr. Justice Hampel, to life imprisonment and seven years' gaol respectively on Monday, 12 December 1983.The Age, \\"Robbery death frightening: judge\\", 13 December 1983, p.12 Four and a half years later, on 30 March 1988, Larson escaped from custody at the Melbourne City Watch-house in company with Paul Alexander Anderson (who had been imprisoned for car theft and other convictions). They were both recaptured in Adelaide, charged with firearms offences, and extradited back to Victoria.Jail Escapers Extradited, The Sydney Morning Herald, (8 April 1988), p.8.

In Brief: Escapers in custody, The Age, (Friday, 8 April 1988), p.3. Later, in 1992, Larson was again incarcerated for armed robbery, and was convicted twice in the first part of 2003, for separate assaults on police. In November 2003, Larson (who was now living in Preston) appeared in court, facing 13 charges rising from an entirely unprovoked knife attack on three unarmed cleaners at Southbank at 2:00 am on 29 September 2003.Lapthorne, K., \\"No bail for stab accused\\", Herald Sun, (7 November 2003), p.29. Remembered The grace, strength, and safety of his marking, especially at full-back, has seldom been matched;Tiger Defender Marks, The Age, (Friday, 26 April 1963),p.20. and the consistent beauty, length, and accuracy of his drop kicking was wonderful to behold. He was a tough, tenacious, and fearless footballer, able to play through injury and, on at least one occasion, played with a broken bone in his arm (Hogan, 1996, p. 224). Although predominantly a right foot kick, he could kick well with either foot.Full forward Fred Swift has a left foot shot for goal during Richmond's main practice match yesterday, The Age, (Monday, 18 April 1966), p.26 He is vividly remembered for his happy, smiling face, his rolling gait, and his gentle friendliness to all and sundry. At Richmond he was a greatly respected and very popular clubman, who was \\"always available to help the recruits with some friendly advice and took a keen interest in the development of the younger players ensuring that they fitted in well\\" (Hogan, 1996, p. 224).A similar view was expressed by Kevin Sheedy whose first year at Richmond, interrupted by his own knee injury in Round 8 (Sheedy only played six senior games in that season), was Swift's last season: \\"Fred was one of those old-fashioned players at Richmond who had been through the hard times and kept an eye on younger teammates\\" (Prior, 1995, p.345). A grandstand at the home ground of the Corowa Football Club was named The Fred Swift Stand in his honour. In 1986, he was posthumously inducted into the Bendigo Football League's Hall of Fame. The \\"Fred Swift Medal\\" is awarded in his honour each season to the player who finishes fourth in Richmond's best and fairest count.

Farbrace, nicknamed \\"Farbie\\", was a wicket-keeper and right-handed batsman who represented Kent County Cricket Club and Middlesex County Cricket Club, playing in 40 first-class cricket matches and 28 List A cricket matches. He enjoyed considerable success as head coach of the Sri Lankan Cricket Team, winning the ICC World Twenty20 2014 and Asia Cup 2014. Playing career Farbrace played for Kent between 1987 and 1989 and for Middlesex from 1990 to 1995. His peak season in county cricket was 1991, when he played 20 first- class matches, made 54 dismissals, but he only averaged 14.81 with the bat. With an overall career batting average of 18.23 he only made another four appearances in first-class cricket, all of which were matches against universities, rather than County Championship matches. He was replaced as wicket-keeper by longstanding Middlesex player Keith Brown, who had played as a specialist batsman while Farbrace was in the side. Coaching career=Early career Farbrace's early forays into a coaching career saw him spend two years coaching U15 football at Hampton School. Despite some mediocre results, Hampton's style of football was widely admired throughout the London Schools football scene. Following Hampton, he led England's Under 19 side, and the national women's team in 2000. Following a spell running the Kent Academy, he was appointed as the assistant coach to Trevor Bayliss for Sri Lanka in July 2007. He sustained a minor injury when the Sri Lankan team was attacked by terrorists in Lahore in March 2009. Kent He was named first-team coach of Kent for the 2010 season on 31 July 2009. Kent finished the season second bottom of the County Championship and were relegated to the second tier after earning promotion the previous season. Kent won three of their sixteen matches and finished with 151 points. In the Clydesdale Bank 40, Kent finished runners up in their group to Warwickshire, narrowly missing out on reaching the Quarter finals. Kent failed to progress beyond the group stage of the domestic T20 competition, finishing seventh in their group. Kent endured a difficult second season under Farbrace. In the first season back in Division two, they could only manage five wins, finishing the competition second bottom. They finished fourth in the Group stage in the Clydesdale Bank 40 competition. In the Twenty20 competition they qualified from the group, finishing third and earning a place in the Quarter finals. However, they lost the quarter final against Leicestershire in a high scoring game. At the end of the season Farbrace left his role and was replaced by Jimmy Adams. Upon leaving Canterbury, Farbrace was appointed to the role of Second XI Coach for Yorkshire County Cricket Club, prior to the start of the 2012 domestic cricket season. Sri Lanka2013/14 Pakistan= On 20 December 2013, he was named as the coach of Sri Lanka national cricket team. Sri Lanka won Farbrace's first game in charge in an ODI against Pakistan. However, they lost the next game by 113 runs. They lost the next game of the series but went on to win the last by two. Sri Lanka lost the series 3‚Äì2, although Farbrace was not in charge for Sri Lanka's first defeat. The first Test between the two sides was a high scoring match which ended in a draw. Sri Lanka won the second match of the series comprehensively, securing a 9 wicket victory. However, they lost the final match of the series by five wickets meaning that the three match series in the UAE ended 1‚Äì1. =2014 Bangladesh= Sri Lanka secured a comprehensive victory over Bangladesh in the first Test between the two sides, winning by an innings and 248 runs. The second Test between the two sides ended in a draw, meaning Sri Lanka won the series 1‚Äì0, their first series victory under Farbrace. Sri Lanka won the two match T20 series 2‚Äì0 and then went on to win the three match ODI series 3‚Äì0. This meant that in the seven matches played between the two teams, Sri Lanka won six, continuing Farbrace's impressive start to the job. =2014 Asia Cup= In the first match of the 2014 Asia Cup, Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 12 runs. They narrowly won their next match against India by two wickets. After beating Afghanistan by 129 runs, Sri Lanka continued their winning run by beating Bangladesh by three wickets. After winning all their games, Sri Lanka met Pakistan in the tournament final, where they won by five wickets to secure their fifth Asia Cup title overall and their first since 2008. =2014 Twenty20 World Cup= Sri Lanka won their first match of the campaign, beating South Africa by five runs. They continued their good start to the competition after comprehensively beating the Netherlands. They suffered their first defeat of the competition after losing to England, but bounced back to beat New Zealand by 59 runs to qualify for the qualify for the semi finals. They played West Indies for a place in the final, and they won the game by 27 runs to set up a final against India. Sri Lanka won the match by six wickets to win the tournament for the first time in their history. He resigned in April 2014 to become the assistant coach of England. EnglandAssistant Coach under Moores2014 Sri Lanka Working under Peter Moores, Farbrace's first opposition as England Assistant was against his old team, Sri Lanka. England narrowly lost the opening T20 match between the two sides in a high scoring match. England got off to a good start in the ODI series, winning a rain affected match after bowling out Sri Lanka for just 144. The next match saw England suffer a heavy defeat after they were bowled out for just 99. However, in the next game England bounced back, bowling Sri Lanka out for just 67 and winning the match by 10 wickets. They narrowly lost the fourth ODI by 7 runs, despite a quick fire century from Jos Buttler. England lost the final game of the series by six wickets to lose the series 3‚Äì2. However, England's performances had been well received and most pundits agreed that an improvement had been made following the disastrous tour of Australia. Moores' first test in charge ended in a draw, although England fell just one wicket short of winning the game. Stuart Broad took what he thought was the winning wicket with the penultimate ball of the match, only for the decision to be referred and overturned. The final match of the series was again a close affair, although this time it was Sri Lanka pressing for the win. Despite a century from Moeen Ali, England were bowled out in their second innings with the penultimate ball of the series, giving a Sri Lanka a 1‚Äì0 series win. 2014 India Following the defeat to Sri Lanka, pressure was put on England to make changes ahead of the series with India. However, no changes were made and England secured a draw in the first Test. However, they lost the second Test and pressure was put on captain Alastair Cook and Moores and Farbrace. Both men stayed on, and England turned the series around. Moores handed wicketkeeper Jos Buttler a Test debut, and the team went on to win the third Test to level the series at 1‚Äì1. England then secured a comfortable victory in the fourth Test to go 2‚Äì1 up, with Ian Bell and Alastair Cook returning to form. In the final match of the Test series, England again won to win the series 3‚Äì1 and hand Moores and Farbrace their first series win since returning to England. The ODI series was less successful. Moored handed a debut to Alex Hales, although England went on to lose the first three matches of the series. Moores again stood by captain Alistair Cook, and England went on to win the final match of the series. They also won the only T20 match between the two sides to end the series on a high. 2014/15 Build up to World Cup England travelled to Sri Lanka for a seven match ODI series. They lost the first two matches to go 2‚Äì0 down in the series, but won the third match. After losing the next match, England again won to keep the series alive at 3‚Äì2. However, they were comprehensively beaten in the final two matches of the series which led to questions being asked again of Alistair Cook. Throughout the tour Moores had remained loyal to Cook, but after the final game he hinted that there may be changes. Cook was later removed as ODI captain, with Eoin Morgan taking over. The tri-series against India and Australia marked Morgan's first series as skipper. Morgan hit a century in the opening match, although England were beaten by Australia. England improved in the following match against India, securing a comfortable win. However, they again suffered defeat to Australia meaning that they had to beat India in the final game to qualify for the final. They did so, but again suffered defeat to Australia when they met in the final. Despite finishing as runners up, the consensus was that England had improved and were now in a stronger position ahead of the World Cup. 2015 World Cup England's World Cup campaign got off to a poor start as they suffered a 111 runs defeat at the hands of Australia. They suffered another humiliating defeat in their next match as lost to New Zealand by eight wickets. England relieved the pressure on them by securing a comfortable win against Scotland, but another heavy defeat, this time nine wickets against Sri Lanka, meant that England had to win their final two games to qualify. Defeat against Bangladesh ended any hopes of qualification, which led to suggestions that the current England coaching team could be replaced. However, Moores and Farbrace were backed by Paul Downton to rebuild the side, with Moores himself saying he was committed to the job. England won their final match against Afghanistan by nine wickets. 2015 West Indies Moores remained in charge of England for their tour of West Indies despite the resignation of the man who appointed him, Paul Downton. In the first match of the series, England got off to a good start, posting 399 in the first innings and then bowling the West Indies out for 295. However, they were unable to force a result and the match ended in a draw, with the West Indies saving the match. England won the second match of the series following a good batting display in the first innings. They bowled the West Indies out for 307 in the second innings, and then won the game by nine wickets thanks to contributions from Alistair Cook and Gary Ballance. Despite this, England lost the final match of the series after setting the West Indies a small target to chase in their second innings after an England batting collapse. The West Indies won the match by five wickets to draw the series 1‚Äì1. After the series Moores played down talk for the need of an enquiry, but rumours persisted that Moores' job was in danger. Moores remained in charge for the ODI match against Ireland, which was abandoned due to rain. After Andrew Strauss was appointed Director of Cricket, Moores was sacked as England coach and replaced by his assistant, Paul Farbrace. =Interim Coach= Following the appointment of Andrew Strauss as Director of Cricket, Peter Moores was sacked as coach. However, Farbrace stayed on, acting as Interim head coach for the series against New Zealand. The first squad selected under his stewardship was similar to Moores' final squad, with Adam Lyth being confirmed as the man to replace the retiring Jonathan Trott. England won their first Test under Farbrace in a thrilling game against New Zealand. However, they went on to lose the second Test and the two match series ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. England had several new players in the squad for the ODI series, but the team soon clicked and put in an impressive performance in the first game, with England scoring 408. New Zealand won the next two games in the series to lead 2‚Äì1. However, England won the fourth game in convincing fashion to set up a decider in the final match of the series. England went on to win it by three wickets to win the series 3‚Äì2. England also won the only T20 match between the two sides, achieving victory by a margin of 56 runs. =Assistant Coach under Bayliss= When new coach Trevor Bayliss was appointed, it was announced that Farbrace would work under him as assistant coach as he had done previously with Sri Lanka. 2015 Australia Farbrace worked under Bayliss for England for the first time in the 2015 Ashes series. Going into the series, England were underdogs. Ahead of the first Test, there were no changes to the England squad and the same team was selected that played in the New Zealand Test series, which Farbrace had been in charge of. England won the first Test by 169 runs, with Joe Root in particular impressing. In the second Test England suffered a heavy defeat by 405 runs after a batting collapse in the second innings. England made two changes for the third Test, with Jonny Bairstow replacing the out of form Gary Ballance and Steven Finn replacing the injured Mark Wood. England went on to win the game by eight wickets after dismissing Australia for 136 in their first innings. James Anderson took 6‚Äì47 in the Australian first innings, while Steven Finn took 6‚Äì79 in their second innings. Ahead of the fourth Test James Anderson was ruled out through injury and replaced by Mark Wood. England bowled Australia out for just 60 in their first innings, with Stuart Broad taking 8‚Äì15. After Joe Root scored a century in England's reply, Ben Stokes took six Australian second innings wickets as England won by an innings and 78 runs. With the Ashes already won, England named an unchanged team, with Anderson still injured. Australia made a big total in their first innings, and England were dismissed cheaply in theirs. Although England batted better when following in, Australia won the game by an innings and 48 runs. Despite this, England won the Ashes 3‚Äì2 and regained the urn. In the limited overs series, England won the first T20 match between the sides. Joe Root was rested for the ODI series and James Taylor replaced him at three. The ODI series got off to a bad start for England, with them losing the first two games. However, they won the third match by 93 runs and won the fourth by three wickets. England lost the final match of the series to lose it 3‚Äì2. Pakistan 2015 Adam Lyth was replaced as opener for the series against Pakistan, with Moeen Ali being moved up the order to replace him. England drew the first game with debutant Adil Rashid helping to almost force a result for England. England lost the next two games of the series, by 178 runs and 127 runs. The decision to move Moeen Ali up the order did not work out, and England's spinners didn't offer a genuine threat throughout the series. Despite the setback, England continued their progression which started under Farbrace in limited overs cricket. Despite losing the opening match of the ODI series, they recovered to win it 3‚Äì1, winning the last three games by a margin of 95 runs, 6 wickets and 84 runs respectively. While England had modified their approach on the sub continent, they still played an aggressive brand of cricket, scoring 355 in the final game of the series. With the T20 World Cup approaching, England experimented in their selections for the three T20 internationals. Sam Billings and James Vince both came into the side and impressed, with Vince being named man of the series, while Chris Jordan returned to the side and demonstrated his credentials as a death bowler, bowling the Super Over in the final game of the series to help England win it 3‚Äì0, and make it six victories on the bounce. South Africa 2015/16 England again changed opener for their series against South Africa, with Alex Hales opening and Moeen Ali moving back down the order. Nick Compton also returned to the side. England won the first game by 241 runs, after passing 300 in both innings, before a fit again Steven Finn helped bowl South Africa out for 174 in their second innings. After a high scoring second match, in which Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow both hit centuries, England won the third game of the series thanks to a superb bowling display from Stuart Broad. The victory gave England an unassailable 2‚Äì0 series lead with one game left to play. England lost the final game of the series after a batting collapse in the second innings. Despite winning the first two ODIs in convincing fashion, England lost the final three games of the series to lose the ODI series 3‚Äì2. However, Alex Hales' form with the bat was a major positive for England as was the emergence of Reece Topley in the bowling unit. England lost both of the T20 games they played to mean they ended the tour with five straight defeats. They were thrashed by nine wickets in the final game of the series, and their last game before the T20 World Cup, with England's seam bowlers being unable to cope with AB de Villiers, Quintin de Kock or Hashim Amla. 2016 T20 World Cup Farbrace had previously won the World T20 with Sri Lanka, while Trevor Bayliss and Otis Gibson had also previously won the tournament as coaches. England lost the first game against the West Indies, and looked to be heading for defeat against South Africa, but Jason Roy and Joe Root ensured they chased down 230 for victory. It looked like a collapse would be on the cards against Afghanistan, but Moeen Ali and David Willey lead the recovery to help England to a 15 run victory. After beating Sri Lanka, England qualified for the semi-finals against New Zealand. Good death bowling from David Willey and Chris Jordan saw England restrict their opponents to 153‚Äì8, and they went on to win the match by seven wickets. England lost the final after Ben Stokes was hit for four consecutive sixes, although it was still a big improvement from England and their exciting brand of cricket was generally praised. 2016 Sri Lanka Following their win over South Africa, England went into the series against Sri Lanka on a high. The only change to the Test side was enforced, with James Vince replacing James Taylor, who had retired due to health reasons. England won the first Test by an innings and 88 runs, with James Anderson taking ten wickets in the match. England followed this up with another convincing victory, this time winning by 9 wickets after a Moeen Ali century and further impressive bowling performances from James Anderson and Stuart Broad. The final game was rain affected an ended in a draw, with England winning the series 2‚Äì0. England continued their attacking brand of cricket in the ODI series, with the first game of the series ending in a tie after both sides scored 286 from their 50 overs. England won the next match by 10 wickets after a record breaking opening stand from Alex Hales and Jason Roy, before the third game finished in a draw due to rain. England won the fourth game by six wickets, with Jason Roy scoring yet another century, before England won the final game of the series after a strong bowling performance, which included four wickets for David Willey, meaning they won the series 3‚Äì0. The only T20I between the two sides saw England debuts handed to Liam Dawson and Tymal Mills. Dawson was particularly impressive, tasking figures of 3‚Äì27, before an unbeaten 73 from Jos Buttler saw England record an eight wicket victory. 2016 Pakistan Going into the Test series against Pakistan, England made no major changes to their Test side, although Jake Ball was given a debut to replace the injured James Anderson, while Gary Ballance was bought back into the side. England lost the first game of the series by 75 runs. However, they performed much better in the next game and secured a convincing 330 run win over the tourists after strong performances from Joe Root and Alastair Cook. A good comeback saw England win the third Test despite being over 100 runs behind after the first innings. England led 2‚Äì1 going into the final Test. However, they lost the final game of the series after Pakistan scored 542 and then dismissed England for 253 in the second innings, and went on to secure a 10 wicket victory to level the series at 2‚Äì2. In the ODI series England again kept a similar squad, and secured comfortable victories over Pakistan in the first two matches. In the third match, England set a world record score of 444/3 thanks to a record high score from Alex Hales and strong contributions from Eoin Morgan, Joe Root and Jos Buttler. England won the fourth ODI but lost the final match of the series, meaning they won the series 4‚Äì1. England lost the only T20I between the sides by nine wickets after struggling with both bat and ball. 2016 Bangladesh Several new players were called up to the side for the tour of Bangladesh. Ben Duckett and Haseeb Hameed both received their first call-ups, with Zafar Ansari, Gareth Batty and Adil Rashid also included. Eoin Morgan and Alex Hales both pulled out of the tour due to safety concerns. England started off the tour well, beating Bangladesh by 21 runs in the first ODI, with Jake Ball taking five wickets on his ODI debut. However, they lost the next game by 34 runs. In the final match of the series, England won by four wickets to seal a 2‚Äì1 series win. England won the first Test between the sides by 22 runs, with Ben Stokes impressing for England. In the second match, England built a lead in the first innings, but a collapse saw tem lose the match by 108 runs and the series finished 1‚Äì1. 2016‚Äì17 India England kept the same squad that faced Bangladesh ahead of the Test series against India. England performed well in the first Test, almost the game having played well with the bat. Four players, Alistair Cook, Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali scored centuries for England in the match. However, they were beaten soundly by 246 in the second game, despite James Anderson and Stuart Broad chipping in with wickets. Jos Buttler returned to the Test side for the third Test, but England again struggled, having been dismissed for 283 in the first innings before India scored 417. Haseeb Hameed batted well for England in their second innings, although India chased down their small target to win by eight wickets. Following the game, Hameed was ruled out for the rest of the series through injury along with Zafar Ansari, resulting in Keaton Jennings and Liam Dawson being called up to the squad. Jennings scored a century on his debut in the next Test, but England's bowlers again struggled, with India scoring 631 to win the match by an innings and 36 runs. In the final Test, England posted 477 in their first innings, but India again dominated with the bat, scoring 759/7. England collapsed on the final day, and India won by an innings and 75 runs to win the series 4‚Äì0. England kept a similar squad to the one that was selected for Bangladesh for the ODI series against India. They lost the first match by 3 wickets despite scoring 350/7, and then lost the second game by 15 runs after India scored 381/6. They won the final match of the series, their first on tour as they secured a five run victory after scoring 321/8, to put an end to six consecutive defeats, although they lost the series 2‚Äì1. England altered their bowling line up for the T20I series, bringing in Chris Jordan and Tymal Mills. They won the first match by seven wickets. However, they lost the second match narrowly by five runs. In the final match of the series England collapsed and were bowled out for 127 as India won by 75 to win the series 2‚Äì1, meaning England suffered defeat in all three series between the sides. 2017 West Indies England toured the West Indies for a three match ODI series. England kept the same that had been used against India. They won the first game by 45 runs after making 296‚Äì6 before bowling out the West Indies for 251. The second game was tighter, but an impressive partnership between Joe Root and Chris Woakes saw England chase down their target of 226 to win by four wickets. The final game of the series was more convincing for England, with them making a score of 328 following centuries from Joe Root and Alex Hales, before bowling the West Indies out for 142, winning game by 186 runs and the series 3‚Äì0. In February 2019 it was announced that Farbrace would be leaving his England post to join Warwickshire as their Sporting Director.

Usually, it is widely understood to be an area between Kensington Avenue to the east and Broad Street to the west, and between Hunting Park Avenue to the north and York Street to the south, mostly coinciding with the neighborhoods of Fairhill, Glenwood, Hunting Park, Harrowgate, Stanton, North Central, West Kensington, Hartranft, and Kensington. The term \\"The Badlands\\" was popularized in part by the novel Third and Indiana by then Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Steve Lopez. The neighborhood also was featured in several episodes of ABC's Nightline. The intersection of 3rd Street and Indiana Avenue was listed number two in a 2007 list of the city's top ten drug corners according to an article by Philadelphia Weekly reporter Steve Volk.Volk, Steve. \\"Top 10 Drug Corners \\". Philadelphia Weekly. May 2, 2007. Retrieved on January 20, 2009. The term Badlands was first used by Lt. John Gallo, who headed the East Division Narcotics Task Force. Its use spread, with many people attempting to take credit for the moniker. It was Gallo's work along with ASAC Billy Retton that worked about a dozen long-term investigations in the 25th and 26th Police Districts that preceded \\"Operation Sunrise\\". Ted Koppel, Geraldo Rivera, 20/20 and 48 Hours all rode with Gallo at one time or another, and it was during this time that Gallo was able to make the name stick. At one time a center of heavy industry, much of the Badlands' urban landscape is now characterized by vacant warehouses and tightly-packed strips of brick row houses constructed for the working class of the neighborhood. Like most industrial cities in the eastern United States, Philadelphia suffered economic decline following the movement of industry to either the suburbs or developing countries and has suffered as a result. The Philadelphia Badlands contain a diverse mix of ethnicities. Puerto Ricans are the largest group, but the area also contains large populations of Black Americans, Irish Americans, and Dominican Americans. The area encompasses El Centro de Oro, the heart of Philadelphia's Puerto Rican community. Although much of the area's crime stems from local neighborhood-based street gangs and the drug trade, larger, more organized gangs also operate in the area, including the Black Mafia, Latin Kings, and various motorcycle gangs. Aside from less-organized gang activity, the Badlands is also known as the founding location and current turf of the Irish-American organized crime group known as the K&A; Gang (also known as the Northeast Philly Irish Mob). Circa 2012, Irish Americans constitute more than 12% of the population of the Badlands. The area's reputation has been countered by community activists and nonprofit organizations such as Centro Nueva Creaci√≥n, which in 2010 conducted a summer children's program, \\"The Goodlands Photographers\\", aimed at helping young people photograph and display positive images of their neighborhood.

His appearances for Hampshire continued to be sporadic throughout 1922, though he continued with first-class cricket for other sides, again playing for the Army, the MCC and the Combined Services, also playing for the Free Foresters and another Gentlemen v Players match. He played many more times for Hampshire in 1923, playing seven County Championship matches, also playing for them against Oxford University and Cambridge University. He again played matches for the MCC and the Army this year, including a match for the MCC against the West Indies.

He played ten first-class matches on the tour, including three against the South African national side. His performance on this tour seemed to secure him a more regular place in the Hampshire side in 1925, playing thirteen County Championship matches that year, also playing another Gentlemen v Players match. He was again selected for a touring side that winter, this time for the MCC side touring the West Indies. He played eleven first-class matches on the tour, including three against the West Indies side.

Pre-production of the Chiang Kai-shek rifle started in 1935 (year 24 of the Republican calendar, hence the Type 24). It was designated the Type 79 by the Chinese Communists. The rifle was in full-scale production as early as late 1935. However, the full standardization for the production of the Type Zhongzheng rifle only started during the Second Sino-Japanese war and the Hanyang 88 rifle was produced in greater numbers. History The Chinese Chiang Kai-shek rifle A National Revolutionary Army soldier armed with a Type 24 rifle guarding P-40 fighter planes The weapon served as one of the main battle rifles for the Chinese National Revolutionary Army (NRA, or Nationalists). Like the Karabiner 98k, it was a shortened and lightened version of the Gewehr 98, specifically, a copy of the Oberndorf Export Mauser named Standard Modell. 10,000 had been bought by China in 1934 and the Germans provided the tooling to produce the Type 24. The 1934 materials proved to be incorrect and new tools were sent in early 1935. Although it entered production at the Gongxian Arsenal in July 1935, China's limited industrial capacity meant that the rifle was built in relatively low numbers. Initial CKS rifles were made. The name of the rifle was changed from Type 24 to Type Chiang Kai-Shek after a visit of the Generalissimo to the factory. As the war progressed, however, China's industry in western cities like Chongqing and Kunming allowed more and more of these rifles to be produced, although quality controls persisted due to the need to move machinery in order to avoid being captured or destroyed by Japanese troops. Together with the Mauser C96 handgun and the M35 Helmet, these weapons have become recognizable features of the Generalissimo's National Revolutionary Army during China's turbulent early 20th century.https://www.warhistoryonline.com/guest-bloggers/unexpected- partnership-nazi-germany-republic-china.html In an ironic twist, the rifle, although named after Chiang Kai-shek, was also heavily used by the Communists that he fought against during the Chinese Civil War.http://www.chinesefirearms.com/110108/articles/modelcks.htm Chinese Sergeant Tung Chih Yeh claimed to have shot and killed over 100 Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) soldiers using a Chiang Kai-shek rifle with and without a scope in the Yangtze area.Bolt Action: Empires in Flames: The Pacific and the Far East by Andy Chambers, page 39. About 600,000 were produced between 1935 and 1949, of which ~400,000 had been produced during the war. By the end of the 1940s, the Type Chiang Kai-shek rifle was phased out from frontline service in favor of superior American aid equipment, such as the semiautomatic M1 Garand, M1 carbine, and Thompson submachine gun for the Nationalists. Despite being replaced by more modern infantry weapons, the Type Zhongzheng still served the ROC armed forces well into the 1970s as a rifle for reserve forces. The Type Zhongzheng Rifle (along with the American M1 Garand) is still used by the ROC Army as a ceremonial/parade rifle to this very day. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army used the Type Zhongzheng rifle during the Korean War alongside other small arms that were provided as military aid to the PRC by the Soviet Union. Among the weapons provided to Chinese Communist forces in Korea by the Soviet Union included Soviet capture Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles. The Type Zhongzheng rifle was also seen in the hands of the Viet Minh during the First Indochina WarNotes on the Viet Minh Army, The War Office, June 1956, p.25 and of the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. The Chinese People's Militia and smaller local paramilitaries were using Chiang Kai-shek rifles (as well as Arisakas and Mosin‚ÄìNagants) up until 1980 before it was replaced with more modern small arms (e.g. the Chinese Type 56 assault rifle and the Chinese Type 56 carbine) and became a supplemental ceremonial weapon (the main ceremonial rifle is the SKS) for the People's Liberation Army to the present day. Many of these rifles (along with other PLA and People's Militia small arms) were used by various Red Guard factions during the Cultural Revolution in the mid- to late 1960s. Design The major advantage of the Type Chiang Kai-shek over the Arisaka was that it had better stopping power with the use of 7.92x57 cartridge. (.323 inch bullet diameter) ; the rifle also had a better rate of fire and a greater range than the Arisaka. The weapon was shorter, (similar in length to the Karabiner 98k) when compared with the Gewehr 98 and the Arisaka Type 38 but firing produced more blast and recoil. The rifle can have a HY1935 bayonet attached with the same Mauser bayonet lug,http://surplused.com/rifle-chinese-zhong-zheng-shi-mauser-rifle- chiang-kai-shek/ replacing the dadao (Â§ßÂàÄ or literally \\"Big Blade\\", a Chinese single-edged curved sword).

Although Nee and Lee recognized that there were recoveries before the time of the Reformation, their opinion was that the Lord's recovery began with Martin Luther in the Reformation because it was from then that significant recoveries were made. Nee, Watchman. ‚Äò‚ÄôWhat Are We?‚Äô‚Äô Anaheim: Living Stream Ministry, 1991: 5. Print. The Principle of Recovery Witness Lee taught that God was always moving to first establish something, and when it was damaged by Satan, God would move a second time to recover what was lost. This happened first in creation. According to Lee the record of God creating the universe is in Genesis 1:1, ‚ÄúIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.‚Äù The next verse continues with, ‚ÄúAnd the earth became waste and empty,‚Äù indicating something was lost in the original creation. Then the heavens and the earth were ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù in six days beginning with ‚ÄúGod moved upon the face of the waters.‚Äù Similarly the Jewish temple was built by Solomon and then destroyed and subsequently recovered when the Jewish remnant returned from Babylon to Jerusalem as recorded in Ezra and Nehemiah. Witness Lee wrote that \\"the goal of the Lord's recovery is to recover the reality, life, livingness, strength, power, and impact of the matters revealed in the Scriptures.\\"Life-Study of Exodus [c.109, s.3] Brief History Although recoveries occurred before the Reformation, Nee taught that God's greatest recoveries occurred from the sixteenth century onwards, beginning with justification by faith through Martin Luther. The recovery then went on with the Anabaptists who baptized those justified by faith. The following individuals are considered to have contributed to the recovery as well: John Calvin who established the Scottish Presbyterian Church; Philipp Jakob Spener who led his followers into the practice of 1 Corinthians 14; Christian David, Count Zinzendorf. and the Moravian Brethren who were among the first to evangelize worldwide; Miguel de Molinos who wrote ‚Äò‚ÄôSpiritual Guide‚Äô‚Äô; Madame Guyon who contributed to the matters of the union with God‚Äôs will and the denial of the self; Father Fran√ßois F√©nelon worked with Madame Guyon to release many spiritual messages; the church in ‚ÄúPhiladelphia;‚Äù Gottfried Arnold taught on outward practices of the meeting of the church; John Wesley, Charles Wesley, and George Whitefield recovered the matters of salvation, eradication of sin, sanctification, and open-air preaching; Bible expositors among the Brethren such as John Nelson Darby, Edward Cronin and Anthony Norris Groves, William Kelly, Charles Henry Mackintosh, Benjamin Wills Newton, and John Gifford Bellett; Charles Stanley; George Cutting who wrote ‚Äò‚ÄôSafety, Certainty, and Enjoyment;‚Äô‚Äô Robert Govett who taught on the matter of Christian reward; Bibles expositors such as George Hawkins Pember, David Morrieson Panton, Hudson Taylor; George M√ºller who taught on prayer and faith in God‚Äôs word; some among the Christian and Missionary Alliance such as Albert Benjamin Simpson and A. J Gordon who taught practiced living by faith and divine healing; Robert Pearsall Smith who taught that sanctification came through consecration and faith; Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith who wrote ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Christian‚Äôs Secret of a Happy Life‚Äô‚Äô; others such as Stocknell, Evan Hopkins, and Andrew Murray, who wrote ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Spirit of Christ,‚Äô‚Äô continued what Guyon‚Äôs denial of the self and began conferences that led to the Keswick Convention; H.

Recruited from Richmond's country zone in Mildura, Lee played a couple of games in 1977 but took off the following year as the team's regular ruckman, allowing David Cloke to become a centre-half-forward and solving a problem the team had had since the loss of Michael Green and Brian Roberts a few years beforehand. He remained static in 1979, but the following year Lee moved into the elite of Australian Rules as his ability as a knock ruckman combined with the running power of fellow Mildura recruit Dale Weightman, Robert Wiley, Geoff Raines and Bryan Wood to give one of the most potent forward lines in Australian Rules history an abundance of ball. The Tigers won eleven successive matches early in the 1980 VFL season and, after a slump as injuries took toll late on the home-and-away rounds, returned to their most devastating form in the finals. They easily beat in the Qualifying Final, withstood a powerful defence in the Second Semi, and set a record winning margin against a jaded side in the Grand Final. Although Kevin Bartlett unanimously won the Norm Smith Medal, Lee's form in annihilating reigning Brownlow Medallist Peter Moore in the ruck was widely praised and Lee was seen as a \\"superstar\\" for the 1980s. However, as it turned out Lee never lived up to what was expected of him during the 1980s.Main, Jim and Holmesby, Russell (editors); The Encyclopedia of League Footballers (1st edition); p. 248. 1981 was a mediocre season, and 1982 began with Lee hit by a succession of injuries. He broke his wrist in a practice match and did not play until the eighth round,\\"Richmond Picks Brewer\\", in The Age, 14 May 1982, p. 28 then hamstring trouble kept him idle after one match until the thirteenth round.\\"Top Blues Hurt\\"; in The Age, 21 May 1982, p. 26 When Lee did return for good, Michael Roach had been so successful in the ruck that Lee was used initially at full forward; but though he kicked nine goals against in Round 17 that experiment did not last. In the 1982 VFL Grand Final against Carlton Lee's nullification by Warren \\"Wow\\" Jones was a decisive factor in Richmond's loss. 1983 and 1984 saw Lee back to his 1980 form as unchallenged Number One ruckman for the Tigers, in spite of the club declining to near the bottom of the ladder with only seven wins in 1983 and ten in 1984. Lee was regarded as a leading candidate for the Brownlow in both seasons and in 1984 won his club's best-and-fairest by a record margin, in the process being listed as one the VFL \\"Players of the Year\\". However, 1985 saw a succession of major injuries begin to decimate the remainder of Mark Lee's career: he missed the second half of 1985 with medial ligament damage to his left knee and from 1986 to 1991 played just eighty-seven senior games. After two games in 1991, Lee was dropped to the reserves and he retired officially mid-season.\\"The 'General' Retreats\\" in McDonald, John; Football Year 91; pp. 130‚Äì130. Lee then switched to Burnie Tigers in Tasmania as captain-coach for two seasons in 1992 and 1993VFL/AFL Players and continued as non-playing coach for one more year after merging with Burnie Hawks.

In 2013 FremantleMedia will become the main international distributor for Vuguru, distributing its products outside of the US and Canada. Multi-platform content Early Vuguru multi-platform series included SamHas7Friends (which Vuguru acquired in 2007) and Foreign Body, a prequel to the novel by Robin Cook, shot primarily on location in New Delhi, India. In 2010 Vuguru targeted the production of ten to fifteen new series for Internet distribution. In 2011 Vuguru partnered with comic book guru Stan Lee's company POW! Entertainment to produce additional content. New Vuguru web series have included Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Little Women Big Cars, The Millionaire Tour, Nuclear Family, Off Season, Fetching, Crawlspace, and Pretty Tough. Prom Queen Prom Queen Season One logo The studio's first project, Prom Queen, consisted of 90-second shorts in 80 episodes and was distributed online, beginning in April 2007. The cost of each 90-second episode was approximately $3000. The project was well reviewed online and attracted over twenty millions viewers. The second season was entitled Prom Queen: Summer Heat, and the third season Prom Queen: Homecoming was released on the CW network platforms. The All-for- Nots The Vuguru web series The All-for-Nots was distributed online by HDNet. The show has been described as modern version of The Monkees or Spinal Tap, as it features a made-for-the-web indie band with the same name as the title of the show. The web series follows the All-for-Nots, a band originating in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on a fictional national tour across the US. It was released in 24 seven-minute episodes, in addition to 30 shorter web clips that provide background on the band and its members. The show was nominated for three Streamy Awards in 2009, including Best Cinematography in a Web Series, Best Original Music in a Web Series, and Best Ad Integration in a Web Series, which it lost to fellow Vuguru web series Back on Topps. Back on Topps Back on Topps Season One logo Vuguru produced two seasons of the sports comedy web series Back on Topps. The show was nominated for a Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding New Approaches in Sports Programming: Short Format in 2009. That year the show also won a 2009 Streamy Award for Best Ad Integration in a Web Series. In 2010 it was the winner of the Streamy Award for Best Branded Entertainment Web Series and nominee for the 2010 Streamy Awards for Best Writing for a Comedy Web Series, Best Ensemble Cast in a Web Series, and Best Guest Star in a Web Series. Eisner's investment company is the owner of the Topps merchandise company, from which the series gets its name. The comedy was played on FoxSports.com, and was described in its first season as a seventeen episode mockumentary. The Booth at the End The Booth at the End, a psychological thriller in 23-minute installments, made its debut in 2010 in Canada on the website of CityTV. The content is also available in 62 separate two-minute online episodes, and on FX. The Guardian said of the quality of the series that, \\"There is more talent and effort poured into one 120-second nugget, demanding a corresponding surge in effort and engagement from the viewer, than there is in almost any hour of TV elsewhere that you care to name.\\" The show centers around individuals who encounter a man named Xander Berkeley. Berkeley sits in a diner booth silently looking out the window, waiting for a stranger to approach him with friendly banter. When they do, their journey begins. Tasks have included the robbing of a bank for exactly $101,043 in exchange for beauty or setting off a bomb in a cafe in order for a woman's husband to be cured of Alzheimer's. Executives The Chairman and founder of Vuguru is Michael Eisner. In 2009 Vuguru hired Larry Tanz as the company's first President, after having previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer of LivePlanet.

There is no mention of the name of its author and its history remains unclear. However, it is held as a work of both literary and religious value.  History  Prince Ta·πÉro·πá postulated that the KƒÅbymahƒÅjƒÅ≈ßi was likely composed during the reign of King Dro·πádharm at a joint convention of philosophers and royal academicians between the years 1602 and 1627.  Content, language, style  The content of the KƒÅbymahƒÅjƒÅ≈ßi is a rhymed narrative composition retelling the story of MahƒÅjƒÅ≈ßi or Vessantara Jataka (‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏™‡∏™‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏î‡∏£‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏Å; Maha Wetsandon Chadok) in a style known as yok gathƒÅ (‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏Ñ‡∏≤‡∏ñ‡∏≤; yok katha), which is the incantation a sentence or phrase in PƒÅ·∏∑i and then retelling it in Thai. The entire tale being told from start to finish by alternating between the two languages.

Aside from being simply prosework composed to give sermons on the MahƒÅjƒÅ≈ßi itself, each chapter (known as a parb (‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏£‡∏û; bap) when referring to the MahƒÅjƒÅ≈ßi) is in fact quite concise so that it could be directed at an audience of average layfolk.

Distribution and habitat The black rough-winged swallow breeds in open wooded habitats, and has a preference for wetter areas, although some races occur in mountain grassland habitat. It breeds across Africa from eastern Nigeria and Ethiopia south to Angola, northern Zimbabwe and northern Mozambique. The subspecies P. p. holomelaena breeds down south-eastern Africa from southern Mozambique to the Cape in South Africa. This species is mainly resident, apart from seasonal local or altitudinal movements, but P. p. holomelaena is migratory, spending the southern winter north of the breeding range. The nominate race P. p. pristoptera of the mountains of northern Ethiopia moves south after breeding. Description The black rough-winged swallow is a small swallow at 13‚Äì15 cm length with a forked tail. Its plumage is blue-glossed black. Sexes are similar, but the female has shorter outer tail feathers, and less obvious wing serrations. Juveniles are brown with little gloss, and have short tails. There are many subspecies of this swallow, which some authorities may split into different species. In particular, four northeastern races, including nominate P. p. pristoptera, have conspicuous white underwing coverts (all other subspecies are green-glossed and have completely dark underwings), and may be split as the eastern rough-winged swallow or eastern saw-wing (swallow), P. orientalis. This leaves P. p. holomelaena as the black rough-winged swallow, P. holomelaena. Other subspecies are also sometimes elevated to species status, but Turner and Rose take the view that all the races of the black rough-winged swallow are, at best, incipient species.

Their flight is weak and fluttering. It is a quiet species, but it gives a soft ' alarm call. There is also a contact call described for as ' for P. p. holomelaena and ' for orientalis. Breeding The nest is constructed from grass, moss or similar materials, and built in a 30‚Äì60 cm long burrow in a vertical sand or clay bank. This is usually an old burrow of another species like a kingfisher, but may be excavated by the breeding pair. The clutch is two, sometimes three, white eggs. Only one parent, probably the female, incubates for 14‚Äì19 days to hatching, with a further 24‚Äì27 days until the young fledge.

Its canonical jurisdiction is the territory of the Republic of Moldova, and over the Moldovan and Romanian Orthodox diaspora from the former USSR.Mitropolia Ortodoxa Romana a Basarabiei at crestinortodox.ro The Metropolis of Bessarabia was created in 1918, as the Archbishopric of Chi»ôinƒÉu, and organized as a Metropolis, in 1927. Inactive during the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia (1940-1941) and the Soviet rule in Moldova (1944-1991), the Metropolis of Bessarabia was re-activated on 14 September 1992, and raised to the rank of exarchate, in 1995. The current Metropolitan of Bessarabia is Petru (PƒÉduraru).Administrative Organisation of the Romanian Orthodox Church at patriarhia.ro History In 1812, after the annexation of Bessarabia by the Russian Empire, the Orthodox churches were re-organized as the Eparchy of Chi≈üinƒÉu and Hotin, from the churches and monasteries of the Metropolis of Moldavia on that territory that no longer belonged to the Principality of Moldavia, by Gavril BƒÉnulescu-Bodoni, a popular promoter of Moldavian/Romanian language and culture, who also served as its first Archbishop. After 1821, the Russian state and church started an extended policy of Russification. In 1858, after southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia, which soon united with Wallachia to form Romania, the Orthodox churches in Cahul, Bolgrad, and Ismail re-entered under the Romanian Church jurisdiction of the Metropolis of Moldavia, which established the Diocese of the Lower Danube, in 1864.The Lower Danube Archidiocese history In 1878, after Russia re-annexed southern Bessarabia, the Russian Church jurisdiction was reinstated. In 1918, after the Union of Bessarabia with Romania, the archbishop Anastasius Gribanovsky of the Eparchy of Chi≈üinƒÉu was ousted after he refused to accede to Romania's demand to secede from the Russian Orthodox Church and integrate the eparchy in the Romanian one. With the advent of Greater Romania in 1918, there were three church bodies: the autocephalous Romanian Orthodox Church (on the territory of Smaller Romania--prior to 1918--formed in 1872 from the union of the Metropolis of Ungrovlahia with Metropolis of Moldavia), and the non- autocephalous Metropolis of Bessarabia and Metropolis of Transylvania. Therefore, in 1925, the rank of the Romanian Orthodox Church was raised to that of a Patriarchate, with the Metropolis of Bessarabia as one of its five sees. Gurie Grosu was the first Metropolitan of Bessarabia, and Efrem EnƒÉchescu the second. After the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia in 1940, the church, which then was a non-autonomous Metropolis, was banned, and its property has either changed uses, or was transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church, which established the Bishopric in Chi≈üinƒÉu and Moldova. In 1980s, two more bishoprics were added, and the See raised to the status of the Archdiocese, in 1990, and as the Metropolis of Chi»ôinƒÉu and All Moldova, in 1992. After Moldova's independence in 1991, part of the clergy followed Petru PƒÉduraru, the Bishop of BƒÉl≈£i, and re-established the Metropolis of Bessarabia. The Romanian Orthodox Church considered that, during the time, the Russian Orthodox Church jurisdiction on the former territory of Bessarabia was an unfair and abusive act in terms of historical reality and canon law, and as long as it remains under the Russian Orthodox Church, the jurisdiction right of the Metropolis of Chi»ôinƒÉu and All Moldova can be exercised only to the Russian ethnics of Moldova.19 mai 1993 - Scrisoarea Prea Fericitului Patriarh Teoctist cƒÉtre Sanctitatea Sa Alexei II (1993) The Russian Orthodox Church also refused to recognize the authority of the Bessarabian church, and the two metropolia started an uneasy co-existence. During the 1990s, the one subordinated to the Russian Orthodox Church gained the protection of the country's authorities and established itself as the official church, while the Orthodox Church of Bessarabia was refused registration according to the country's new law of religions. In 2004, after years of legal hurdles and a final decision by the European Court of Human Rights, the Orthodox Church of Bessarabia received official registration, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Republic of Moldova recognizing it as \\"the spiritual, canonical, historical successor of the Metropolitan See of Bessarabia which functioned till 1944, including\\".Press release: A legitimate act for defending the Romanian identity - Explanations concerning the juridical recognition of the Metropolitan See of Bessarabia and of the suffragan eparchies , Romanian Patriarchy, 21 February 2008. ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî About 20% of country's Orthodox churches were or changed to be under its jurisdictions; a strong desire to similar moves has been expressed in many other parishes. This decision continues to be a major area of tension with the Russian Orthodox Church. The position of the Romanian Orthodox Church in the dispute with the Russian Orthodox Church over the territorial jurisdiction is, according to a press release, that the two Metropolitan Sees should \\"peacefully co-exist and brotherly cooperate (‚Ä¶) harmonising, with wisdom and realism, the territorial principle with the ethnic principle, as agreed in the pastoral service of the Orthodox in Diaspora.\\" Structure and organization The church is currently recognized only by some other Orthodox Churches, since the Patriarchate of Moscow opposes its recognition by all of them.Lucia Turcescu, Lavinia Stan, Church‚Äìstate conflict in Moldova: the Bessarabian Metropolitanate (abstract) The current Metropolitan of Bessarabia is Petru PƒÉduraru (born 24 October 1946 in ≈¢iganca, elected as metropolitan in 1992), and it has about one third of the orthodox community in Moldova. \\"√énalt Prea Sfin≈£itul Vladimir vorbe≈üte despre unirea Mitropoliei Moldovei cu cea a Basarabiei\\" (\\"Metropolitan Vladimir about the union of the two Metropolitans in Moldova\\"), publika.md, 30 August 2013 The Metropolis of Bessarabia consists of four eparchies: *Archdiocese of Chi»ôinƒÉu *Diocese of BƒÉl»õi *Diocese of Southern Bessarabia *Diocese of DubƒÉsari and Transnistria See also *History of the Orthodox Church in Moldova *Religion in Moldova *List of members of the Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church *Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina *St. Teodora de la Sihla Church *LuminƒÉtorul *Misionarul Gallery File:Stamp of Moldova 128.gifGurie Grosu ReferencesExternal links *Official website *Website *Libert√© de la M√©tropolie de la B√©ssarabie *Freedom of the Metropolis of Bessarabia *DECLARATION ECRITE N¬∞ 265 concernant l'arr√™t de la Cour d'Appel de la R√©publique de Moldova relatif √† la l√©gitimit√© et √† la libert√© de la M√©tropolie de Bessarabie *WRITTEN DECLARATION No. 265 on the decision of the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Moldova on the legitimacy and freedom of the Metropolis of Bessarabia *Droit de l'Eglise m√©tropolitaine de Bessarabie √† sa propre succession juridique *Right of the Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia to its own succession in title *Complicit√© de la Patriarchie de Moscou et de toute la Russie avec le r√©gime ill√©gale et s√©cessioniste install√© √† l'Est de la R√©publique de Moldova *Complicity of the Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia with the illegal and secessionist regime installed in the east of the Moldovan Republic *Statement concerning the arguments of the representatives of the Romanian Orthodox Church justifying the decision to establish dioceses of the Metropolia of Bessarabia *Territorial Jurisdiction According to Orthodox Canon Law.

From 1989 to 2014 he was director on antisemitism, hate studies and extremism for the American Jewish Committee. In 2000, Stern was a special advisor to the defense in the David Irving v. Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt trial. His latest book, The Conflict Over the Conflict: The Israel/Palestine Campus Debate, examines attempts of partisans of each side to censor the other, and the resulting damage to the academy. Education Stern earned his A.B. at Bard College, and his J.D. from Willamette University College of Law. Career Stern has testified before US Congress; in 1997 he served as an invited presenter at the White House Conference on Hate Crimes.Rose Feinberg Memorial Lecture. Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism With Kenneth Stern He analyzed the militia movement, bigotry on campus, hate on talk radio and the Internet. He is a frequent guest on national television and talk radio shows, including Face the Nation, Crossfire, Nightline, Dateline, Good Morning America, CBS Evening News, and National Public Radio. His report Militias: A Growing Danger, issued two weeks before the Oklahoma City bombing, predicted such attacks on the US government. And his book about the militias, A Force Upon the Plain: The American Militia Movement and the Politics of Hate (1996) was nominated for the National Book Award. In 2001 he was an official member of the United States delegation to the Stockholm International Forum on Combating Intolerance. Stern was also a key drafter of a Working Definition of Antisemitism, which has been adopted, starting in January 2005, by various international bodies tasked with monitoring antisemitism.Kenneth S. Stern: Proposal For A Redefinition Of Antisemitism in Defining antisemitism by Dina Porat Before coming to AJC in 1989, Stern was managing partner of the Oregon law firm Rose and Stern. Stern was trial and appellate counsel for American Indian Movement co-founder Dennis Banks, and argued on his behalf before the United States Supreme Court in U.S. v. Loud Hawk et al. Among his other notable cases was his representation of Portland's homeless community in a federal lawsuit against an anti-camping ordinance, and as co-counsel in a defamation suit against Patricia Hearst, representing Jack and Micki Scott. His book about the Dennis Banks case, Loud Hawk: The United States vs. the American Indian Movement (1994), won the Gustave Myers Center Award as outstanding book on human rights. Stern's other books are Holocaust Denial (1993) and Antisemitism Today (2006). Stern is also active in the effort to establish an interdisciplinary academic field of Hate Studies. He previously served on the editorial board of the Journal of Hate Studies,\\" and is a longtime member of the director's advisory board for the Gonzaga University Institute for Hate Studies. Views In his article Holocaust education alone won't stop hate, Stern proposes ways to combat persisting hatred of Jews: In an open letter, coauthored with Cary Nelson, president of the American Association of University Professors, Stern wrote that some of the complaints about anti-Semitism on campus under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \\"simply seek to silence anti-Israel discourse and speakers. This approach is not only unwarranted under Title VI, it is dangerous.\\"Anti-Semitism on Campus By Cary Nelson, AAUP President, and Kenneth Stern, American Jewish Committee Stern's letter was disavowed by AJC executive director David Harris, who called the letter \\"ill-advised.\\"Line Between Anti- Israel and Anti-Semitic Protests Splits AJC; Group's Top Ranks Divided Over How To Respond to Campus Demonstrations, by Rex Weiner, Jewish Daily Forward, August 16, 2011 In 2017 Stern testified before the House Judiciary Committee against legislation that would have used a definition of antisemitism, of which he was the lead drafter, as a de facto hate speech code on campus. In his 2006 book \\"Antisemitism Today\\" Stern wrote: \\"Today‚Äôs main practitioners of race-based antisemitism in the U.S. are neo-Nazis, skinheads, Christian Identity adherents (who believe that people of color are subhuman and that Jews are the offspring of Satan), and various other white supremacists and white nationalists.6 While there are important ideological and theological differences among these groups, they all hate nonwhites. They also see Jews as responsible for opening the door to equal rights and opportunity for nonwhites, as part of a nefarious plot to destroy ‚Äúwhite America‚Äù through immigration, affirmative action, control of the media, and other alleged schemes. While we think of white supremacists as essentially anti-people-of- color with some antisemitism thrown in, antisemitism is actually the ideological (as opposed to emotional) anchor for their movement. If blacks and other minorities are, in their view, unquestionably inferior, how could the superior whites be ‚Äúlosing‚Äù the battle? The white supremacists believe it is because of the secret, cabalistic hand of the Jew, pulling the strings behind the scenes. It is because of ZOG (the Zionist Occupied Government). While race-based antisemitism is at a low point, and has been for many decades, there are reasons to be concerned about its possible growth in the decades to come, particularly because demographic projections indicate that the United States will be a majority nonwhite country by the middle of this century. The race-based antisemitism which is at the core of white supremacy may prove an ideological magnet for people who fear this change.\\" In his book A Force upon the Plain: The American Militia Movement and the Politics of Hate, Stern links Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh with the Militia movement. In a review in 'Reason, Dave Kopel concludes that he \\"does not come remotely close to showing that militia members encouraged McVeigh to do anything illegal\\", but uses circumstantial evidence, guilt by association and undocumented quotes that turn out to be false. Not only militias, but all critics of big government are excoriated in the book. After the 1994 elections, Stern found that \\"the vitriolic antifederal sentiments of some of these newly elected officials\\" differed \\"in detail but not in flavor\\" from the ideas of racist gangs. Kopel considers his use of charges of anti-Semitism and racism as a way of vilifying opponents and delegitimizing political stands he does not like.David B. Kopel: The Militias Are Coming Reason, August/September 1996. But Patsy Sims, writing in the New York Times, noted: \\"The underlying ideology that links the individual groups, Mr. Stern says, is a shared conviction that the United States is being taken over by outside forces with the help of Government insiders. In this scenario, militia members see gun control as the first step in an elaborate plot to take away their weapons, then their rights and finally their freedom.\\" See also *Hate studies *Universities and antisemitism NotesPublications ;Books * Holocaust Denial (New York: American Jewish Committee, 1993) * Loud Hawk: The United States Versus the American Indian Movement (1994) University of Oklahoma Press, 2002: * The Force Upon the Plain: The American Militia Movement and the Politics of Hate (Simon & Schuster, 1996) (University of Oklahoma Press, 1997: ) * Antisemitism Today: How It Is the Same, How It Is Different and How to Fight It (American Jewish Committee, 2006): ;Articles and other publication * Skinheads: Who They Are and What to Do When They Come to Town (The American Jewish Committee, 1990) * Anti-Zionism, the Sophisticated Anti-Semitism (AJC, 1990). * on Campus: A Planned Response, 1990 * Dr. Jeffries and the anti-Semitic branch of the Afrocentrism movement, 1991 * David Duke: A Nazi in politics, 1991 * Hate on talk radio, 1991 * Politics and bigotry, 1992 * Farrakhan and Jews in the 1990s (AJC, 1992, 1994). * Crown Heights: A case study in anti-Semitism and community relations, 1992 * Demjanjuk: An analysis of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Demjanjuk v.

Founded in 1995 by Bill Bell and Jonquil Bevan. Bell, who was Director for almost two decades, was succeeded by Tom Mole. The CHB now serves a community over 30 members of staff across several university departments and is today an internationally recognised centre dedicated to the promotion of Bibliography and Book History. As well as hosting international conferences and seminars, it provides a focus for a number of research projects, and facilitates postgraduate study in the field of the History of the Book.  Research  The Centre has been involved in a number of research projects. These include the Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, a four-volume publication whose aim is to investigate the history of the production, circulation, and reception of Scottish texts from earliest times to the present. The Centre‚Äôs director, Tom Mole, has edited The Broadview Book History Reader with Michelle Levy of Simon Fraser University. The reader reprints 33 key essays in the field, grouped conceptually and provided with headnotes, explanatory footnotes, an introduction, a chronology, and a glossary of terms.  Fellows  The CHB regularly hosts visiting fellows from other universities. Past fellows have included Richard Sher, Alexander Dick and others.  Events = Public Lectures  The CHB hosts an annual public lecture, which at different times has been sponsored by James Thin Booksellers and Blackwell UK. Past lecturers have included Asa Briggs, Lisa Jardine, Bamber Gascoigne, John Thompson, and Alberto Manguel.  Seminar Series  The CHB hosts a seminar series, which runs bi-weekly during the University of Edinburgh term.  Conferences  The CHB has organised a number of conferences, including the ‚ÄòMaterial Cultures‚Äô conferences in 2000, 2005 and 2010, where keynote speakers included Robert Darnton, Stephen Greenblatt and Roger Chartier. More recently, it has hosted some smaller conferences, including Creativity and Commerce in the Age of Print in 2014. In 2015, it hosted a pair of symposia in collaboration with Harvard University, called Books and/as New Media.  Teaching  The Centre provides training in Book History methods and approaches at all levels from undergraduate to postdoctoral.  Summer School  The Centre runs a Summer School course called ‚ÄòBook History for Beginners‚Äô through the University of Edinburgh‚Äôs summer school programme. This course, taught in four modules on ‚Äòprint culture‚Äô, ‚Äòmaterial texts‚Äô, ‚Äòpublishing history‚Äô and ‚Äòthe future of the book‚Äô, introduces students to the major debates in book history.  Master's Degree  The Centre runs an MSc in Book History and Material Culture. The programme comprises two core courses \\"Cultures of the Book\\" and \\"Working with Collections\\", plus an option course in each semester and the Research Methods course. The dissertation is researched and written over the summer. Students also have the option of undertaking work placements as part of the degree.  Doctoral Training  The Centre received a grant in 2015 from the Scottish Graduate School for the Arts and Humanities to provide training workshops for doctoral students researching topics in the field of book history. These workshops are run in collaboration with Stirling University and the University of Dundee.  Books and/as New Media  In 2014, The Centre for the History of the Book won a grant from the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities at the University of Edinburgh to foster new thinking about the history and future of the book.

It claims to be the continuation of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, the ruling party in 1926‚Äì1940. The party was re-established when Lithuania declared independence in 1990 and performed increasingly poorly in the elections. In 2008, it merged with the Homeland Union, but demerged in 2011. In 2017, it merged with the Republican Party. The party promotes traditional family values, advocates for Lithuania's independence from the European Union, opposes immigration.  History  The party was re-established in March 1989 and officially registered in February 1990. It played a diminishing role in Lithuanian politics. In the 1992 Seimas elections, the Lithuanian National Union won 4 seats; in 1996 ‚Äì 3 seats, and since 2000 it has no representatives. The number of representatives in the regional municipalities has also diminished: the party won 49 mandates in 1995, 23 in 1997, 13 in 2000, 14 in 2002, and 3 in 2007. In 1997, the National Democratic Party of Lithuania under the leadership of Rimantas Smetona separated from the Nationalist Union and registered as a new political party in 1999. On 11 March 2008, the Lithuanian Nationalist Union merged into the Homeland Union which formed the coalition government after the 2008 elections. Two members of the party, Kazimieras Uoka and Gintaras Songaila, were elected to Seimas of 2008‚Äì2012 as the members of the Homeland Union. Due to disagreements, the Homeland Union suspended Uoka's and Songaila's membership leading to the demerger. The party declared its political resurrection in a General Assembly on 17 December 2011. On 23 August 2013, the Nationalist Union signed the Declaration of Bauska together with Conservative People's Party of Estonia and All for Latvia!. The declaration calls for a new national awakening of the Baltic states and warns about threats posed by Cultural Marxism, international globalism, multiculturalism and Russian imperial ambitions.NacionƒÅlƒÅ apvienƒ´ba: Baltijas nacionƒÅlisti paraksta sadarbƒ´bas lƒ´gumu, vƒìr≈°oties pret globƒÅlajiem apdraudƒìjumiemBaltimaade konservatiivid: aeg on k√ºps uueks rahvuslikuks √§rkamiseks In November 2013, the Seimas amended the law on political parties requiring a minimum of 2,000 members (up from 1,000) with a grace period of two years to increase the membership. The Nationalist Union grew its membership from 1,649 in 2014 to 2,025 in 2015. In June 2017, the Nationalist Union merged with the Republican Party and was renamed to the Lithuanian Nationalist and Republican Union.

It was described by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, and named on the mistaken assumption it came from New Caledonia. At 37 cm (14.5 in) long it is the largest species of the rosella genus, Platycercus. Two subspecies are recognised. The green rosella's underparts, neck and head are yellow, with a red band above the beak and violet-blue cheeks. The back is mostly black and green, and its long tail blue and green. The sexes have similar plumage, except the female has duller yellow plumage and more prominent red markings, as well as a smaller beak. Juvenile and immature birds have predominantly green plumage. Found in a wide range of habitats with some form of tree cover, the green rosella is predominantly herbivorous, consuming seeds, berries, nuts and fruit, as well as flowers, but may also eat insect larvae and insects such as psyllids. Nesting takes place in tree hollows. Common and widespread across Tasmania, the green rosella is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species. The King Island subspecies has been classed as vulnerable as its population has declined after much of its habitat on King Island was cleared. Taxonomy Male in Tasmania A green rosella specimen was collected in Adventure Bay, Tasmania, by ships' surgeon William Anderson on the third voyage of James Cook between 26 and 30 January 1777. Cook wrote of seeing \\"yellowish paroquets\\" in the woods there. Anderson collected many bird specimens while tasked as the expedition's naturalist, although he died of tuberculosis in 1778 before the return home. Many collection localities were incorrect, and notes were lost or pieced together many years later. The specimen, along with many others, ended up in the collection of British naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. English naturalist John Latham saw it there and wrote about the green rosella in his 1780s work A General Synopsis of Birds. He called it the Caledonian parrot as he assumed (incorrectly) it came from New Caledonia. He even suspected it might be the female of the horned parakeet, which he also saw in Banks' collection. Latham did not give them binomial names, however. It was left to German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin to describe the species, which he did as Psittacus caledonicus in the 13th edition of Systema Naturae in 1788. In 1820, German naturalist Heinrich Kuhl described a specimen that Robert Brown had collected from northwestern King Island on 23 April 1802 during Matthew Flinders' circumnavigation of Australia, naming it Psittacus Brownii in honour of its collector. He based it on the description of la Perruche √† large queue, \\"the long-tailed parrot\\" by French naturalist Fran√ßois Levaillant in his 1805 work Histoire Naturelle des Perroquets. Kuhl's name also took priority over Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck's published name of Psittacus flavigaster, which was published in 1822. Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors established the genus Platycercus in 1825, based on the distinctive architecture of the feathers in the tail and wing, including P. flavigaster and P. brownii within it. English naturalist James Francis Stephens named it Platycercus xanthogaster in 1826, though there was no need for a new binomial name. Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews noted that the name Platycercus flaviventris was commonly used in the 19th century, but highlighted the priority of both P. brownii and P. caledonicus over this, positing the last as the most senior name. He believed the specimens used for P. brownii had come from Derwent in Tasmania. Mathews did feel the King Island form was distinctive, being larger and having more red in the plumage than Tasmanian populations and so described it as P. c. henriettae in 1915. This has since been reclassified as a synonym of P. c. brownii as its status has been recognized as distinct from the Tasmanian mainland taxon‚Äînow known as P. c. caledonicus. Mathews also described P. c. flindersi from Flinders Island in 1917, on the basis of darker plumage. It is now considered as not distinct from the Tasmanian mainland subspecies. \\"Green rosella\\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). Alternative common names include Tasmanian rosella, yellow- breasted parakeet and mountain parrot. English zoologist John Gould called it the yellow-bellied parakeet, and early Tasmanian settlers knew it as the hill parrot. One of six species of rosella in the genus Platycercus, the green rosella and related crimson rosella make up a \\"blue-cheeked\\" lineage. A 1987 genetic study on mitochondrial DNA found that the green rosella was basal to the other blue-cheeked forms, with the north Queensland population of the crimson rosella (P. elegans nigrescens) divergent from other subspecies of crimson rosella. In 2015, Ashlee Shipham and colleagues published a molecular study based on nuclear DNA finding that the North Queensland crimson rosella diverged earlier than the green rosella. They also estimated that the green rosella had diverged from the main crimson rosella lineage around 0.5 million years ago. Description Adult preening, showing dark feather bases The green rosella is the largest member of the rosella genus. Measuring from in length, an adult has long narrow wings with a wingspan of , and a long tail with twelve feathers, the central two of which are wider. The adult male is heavier, averaging around to the female's , and has a larger bill. The adult green rosella has a yellow head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the forehead and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear of the head and neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow of the back of the head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent. Young birds leaving the nest have juvenile plumage in their first year of life. Juveniles have a dark green head and neck, upperparts and underparts. The feathers all have dark brown bases. The wings are predominantly dark brown and black with a blue sheen. The wings and tail are shorter than those of adult birds. The bill may have a buff sheen. They have an under-wing stripe, which is not present in the adults. Moulting generally takes place between January and April for birds of all ages. Juvenile birds then adopt immature plumage, which is similar but with patches of yellow feathers on the underparts of adult plumage as well as some adult-coloured wing feathers. Some green juvenile feathers remain until the bird is in its second year of age, though are very worn by this time. Distribution and habitat Found across Tasmania and Bass Strait islands, the green rosella is one of the commonest birds encountered. It also occurs on offshore islands such as Maria, Bruny, De Witt and Maatsuyker Islands. Its movements have not been much studied. Although possibly locally nomadic in places, the green rosella is sedentary; even birds at higher altitudes do not migrate. It has become rare on King Island, due to land clearing and possibly competition with the introduced common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) for nesting sites. During breeding season there it is restricted to the Pegarah forest, though may venture elsewhere at other times. It lives in most habitats with some form of tree cover up to 1500 m (5000 ft) above sea level. These include temperate beech rainforest (where it generally keeps to the canopy), wet and dry sclerophyll forest, woodland, Melaleuca shrubland, coastal heath, dwarf alpine conifer forest, sedgeland, buttongrass moors, tussock grassland, as well as fields, orchards and urban parks and gardens. Behaviour Green rosellas are generally encountered in pairs or small groups, though young birds may gather in groups of 20 or more outside the breeding season. They sometimes share the company of eastern rosellas. They fly in a straight line, making rapid shallow wingbeats and gliding briefly in between. The green rosella has a repeated two-syllable contact call, which has been written as kussik kussik or cossack cossack and is heard in flight. When perched, it utters a rising kwik-kweek kwik-kweek contact call. Birds also make a chattering call during courtship. They can screech shrilly when alarmed. Breeding The green rosella generally breeds at two years of age, though younger birds may pair up and look for nests. The breeding season is September to January, with one brood. The nesting site is usually a hollow over 1 m (3 ft) deep in a tree trunk anywhere up to 30 m (100 ft) above the ground. The tree chosen is generally a eucalypt such as Tasmanian bluegum, manna gum or mountain ash (E. regnans), or myrtle beech. Chimneys, holes in walls and even the vertical pipes of tennis court fences have been used. Green rosellas nested in a wall cavity at Port Arthur convict prison site in 1958 and 2009. Laying takes place in September and October. A clutch of four or five white and slightly shiny eggs, measuring 30 x 24 mm, is laid. The incubation period has been recorded as anywhere from 19 to 23 days, with the female performing this duty alone. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white down, and are largely helpless (nidicolous). They leave the nest four to five weeks after hatching and join up with other young birds in flocks, though rely on their parents for food for another fortnight after fledging. Feeding Juvenile in Tasmania. It is greener than an adult. The green rosella is predominantly herbivorous, with the seeds of grasses and trees‚Äîespecially eucalypts‚Äîforming the bulk of its diet; other items eaten include the seed of the soft tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica), cranberry heath (Astroloma humifusum), myrtle beech (Lophozonia cunninghamii), Australian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) and buttercups (Ranunculus), berries, nuts and fruit, as well as flowers and new buds of southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), mƒÅnuka (Leptospermum scoparium), shining tea-tree (Leptospermum nitidum), swamp honey-myrtle (Melaleuca squamea), Tasmanian bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus), Smithton peppermint (Eucalyptus nitida), messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua), snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora), manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), small-fruit hakea (Hakea microcarpa) and native plum (Cenarrhenes nitida). The green rosella has at times partaken of the berries of the common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), as well as Coprosma and Cyathodes, and even leaf buds of the common osier (Salix viminalis). It may eat insect larvae and insects such as psyllids of the genus Schedotrioza, which they extract from leaf galls on the black peppermint (Eucalyptus amygdalina). Green rosellas generally forage in the canopy or understory of forested areas, or in hedges, shrubs and trees in more open areas. They come to the ground to eat fallen fruit or spilt grain in orchards or farmland. They keep quiet while on the ground, and are quite noisy when in trees. Green rosellas forage in pairs or small groups of under 20 individuals, though larger groups of 50 to 70 have been observed at stands of blackberries or thistles in fields. When feeding, they generally hold food items in their left feet and extract edible parts or break and discard nut shells with their beaks. Status and conservation Gould noted that early Tasmanian settlers regarded the abundant green rosella highly as food; he agreed that it was very tasty after trying it himself. Many farmers saw the species as a pest of orchards, and green rosellas were shot. In 2016, the green rosella was rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered species. This was on the basis of its large range‚Äîgreater than 20,000 km2 (7700 mi2)‚Äîand small rate of decline in population. The King Island subspecies is listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as vulnerable, and its population thought to number fewer than 500 birds. Around 70% of King Island's native vegetation has been cleared, and the remainder is highly fragmented and at risk of too-frequent bushfires. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. Aviculture Green rosellas were regularly captured and kept as pets until the early 20th century. The species is reported to be hardier and easier to keep in captivity than other rosellas. However, it is not a popular bird in the aviary trade, possibly on account of its subdued colours. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. The species has a reputation for being apathetic and vulnerable to weight gain in captivity; hence it is recommended to be kept in a large aviary of at least 5 m (15 ft) long to keep it active, and to be fed little or no sunflower seeds. As it breeds late in the season, chicks are often small in the heat of summer and can suffer as a result.

The cornets are used only to regulate the motions of the colors; the trumpets serve when the soldiers are ordered out to any work without the colors; but in time of action, the trumpets and cornets sound together. The classicum, which is a particular sound of the buccina or horn, is appropriated to the commander-in- chief and is used in the presence of the general, or at the execution of a soldier, as a mark of its being done by his authority. The ordinary guards and outposts are always mounted and relieved by the sound of trumpet, which also directs the motions of the soldiers on working parties and on field days. The cornets sound whenever the colors are to be struck or planted. These rules must be punctually observed in all exercises and reviews so that the soldiers may be ready to obey them in action without hesitation according to the general's orders either to charge or halt, to pursue the enemy or to retire. For reason will convince us that what is necessary to be performed in the heat of action should constantly be practiced in the leisure of peace. Cornicen on Trajan's column.

The house, constructed of magnesian limestone ashlar with stone slate roofs in a classical style, is built to a linear plan with a main range linked by colonnades to flanking pavilions. The main block is of three storeys with a raised forecourt. The house is surrounded by a 200 ha (500 acre) landscaped park ornamented by a series of follies and avenues laid out in the 18th- century landscape tradition, surrounded by 500 ha (1235 acres) of arable farmland. Bramham park is used annually for the Leeds Festival. History Bramham Park from Jones's Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen (1829). A carriage ramp on the entrance facade conveys visitors to the principal entrance on the piano nobile. The Baroque mansion was built in 1698 for Robert Benson, 1st Baron Bingley. It has remained in the ownership of Benson's descendants since its completion in 1710.Campbell He died with no male heirs and the barony was extinguished. The estate passed into the hands of his son- in-Law George Fox-Lane (c.1697‚Äì1773), who was given the re-created title of Baron Bingley in 1763. His son and heir, the Honourable Robert Fox-Lane, Member of Parliament for York, predeceased him in 1768 and the barony consequently became extinct a second time on his death in 1773. The estate was inherited for life by his illegitimate daughter Mary, who had married Sir John Goodricke of Ribston Hall and died in 1792. It then passed to the first Baron's nephew, James Fox-Lane, who considerably improved the estate. From him the estate went to his son George Lane-Fox, known as \\"The Gambler\\", who was the MP for Beverley. Following a serious fire in 1828 he was obliged to move to nearby Bowcliffe Hall. The Bramham Park house was then left empty and derelict for 80 years until restored for his grandson George Lane-Fox under the supervision of the architect Detmar Blow in about 1908. George became 1st Baron Bingley of the third creation when the title was recreated in 1933,The Peerrage, entry for Lord Bingley but had four daughters and no sons meaning that the barony was extinguished for the third time upon his death. The house was inherited by his eldest daughter Marcia, whose husband Joe Ward-Jackson adopted the Lane-Fox surname. Their son George Lane Fox (1931‚Äì2012), after 20 years in the Household Cavalry, moved into the Hall and put the estate on an up-to-date financial footing, founding the annual Bramham Horse Trials in 1974. Today it remains a private residence in the hands of George's son, Nick, while the park is the setting for the Horse Trials and the Leeds Festival, which moved to Bramham in 2003. A restricted area of the grounds is kept as gardens and run as a tourist attraction ‚Äî visitors can also tour the house but only in pre-arranged parties. It was used as the setting for the BBC's 3rd series of The Syndicate.  Architecture  The Stables Chatsworth House, England's first truly Baroque house, was built between 1687 and 1707, almost exactly contemporary with Bramham. It was designed by William Talman. Colen Campbell's drawings of Bramham of 1717 show a remarkable similarity of style between the corps de logis of Bramham and Chatsworth. Bramham Park, drawn by Colen Campbell in 1717. The statuary decorating the roofscape was never executed. The carriage ramp is an unusual feature, leading to the piano nobile. Bramham is a product of a grand tour; its creator Robert Benson, later Lord Bingley, completed his formal education with a grand tour in 1697, and whilst in Italy he began to envisage his new mansion in the Palladian manner complemented in a landscaped park, in the fashion made popular by Le N√¥tre in France in the late 17th century. The architect of Bramham is unknown, although it is speculated that Giacomo Leoni was involved Bramham Park (Leoni was responsible for the rebuilding of Lyme Park in an Italianate style in the neighbouring county of Cheshire some years later). However, Leoni did not arrive in England until several years after the completion of Bramham. Other names suggested include those of James Gibbs, Thomas Archer and James Paine. It is known that Paine designed the stables which flank the corps de logis, but the other contenders were too young. The only chronological possibility is Thomas Archer (1668‚Äì1743).The possible architects are suggested in \\"Tour of the House\\" published by Bramham Estate; the reasons why they are discounted here are widely known and based on accepted factual information from numerous sources. The most likely scenario is that Bramham is the work of Robert Benson himself,This theory is the one preferred in Bramham Park. probably working with a local draughtsman. While it is also quite possible that Benson was inspired by drawings taken from Palladio's books, the design of the house suggests that Benson was more inspired by the restrained Baroque style then popular in France, the style in which Mansart's Versailles was constructed between 1678 and 1684. Indeed, it has been speculated that Versaille's landscape architect Andr√© le N√¥tre had a hand in the design of Bramham's landscaped park. The architect William Talman has also been suggested as a possible architect, and he was indeed working on Chatsworth House some sixty miles away from Bramham at this time. However, unlike Chatsworth (which is far larger), Bramham is given flanking wings more in the Palladian style, linked to the house by short colonnades. The flanking wings contained the kitchen in the south wing, and the chapel in the north, thus ‚Äì as at the Baroque Blenheim Palace ‚Äì balancing both spiritual and bodily needs equally. However, while Campbell's drawing of Bramham show the never-executed statuary on the roof and near-perfect proportions, the reality of the executed design suggests a less professional hand than Talman's. Two low projecting wings from the corps de logis complicate the design, while the two colonnades are not quite long enough to give the flanking wings the independence from the main house to allow their design to be fully appreciated.  Interior  The interior of Bramham Park was completely restored in the early part of the 20th century, having mostly been abandoned after the fire of 1828. The central Great Hall, double storey in height and severe in its Baroque design, still bears the smoke staining on its stone walls.  Grounds  The parkland surrounding the house contains a number of grade I listed ornamental structures, including: The Chapel * The Chapel Situated at the rear of the house, the chapel, was built around 1760 by James Paine for George Fox Lane in the local Magnesian limestone ashlar. It was constructed in the classical style as a single unit of 2 storeys and 3 bays and with a porch and four Ionic columns across the full width of ground floor. Originally built as a Palladian Temple it was later used as an Orangery, a summerhouse and then consecrated as a chapel around 1906. The Gothic Temple * The Gothic temple South of the house stands the Gothic Temple, also constructed of Magnesian limestone ashlar in the 18th century. Built in a Gothic style in two storeys it is octagonal in plan with buttresses at each corners. In 1907 it was converted into a water tower to supply spring water to the house and was used as such until after the World War II. The Open Temple * The Open Temple The Open Temple was probably constructed in the early 18th century in Magnesian limestone ashlar and was built in a classical style as a single cell with a pedimented 3-bay facade. The temple was also known as the Lead Lads Temple from the lead statues which once stood on the pediment. They were stolen by vandals. The Obelisk * The Ionic Temple or Rotunda Standing in the Black Fen pleasure ground, the Ionic Temple was probably built in the mid 18th century by James Paine for George Lane Fox. It is constructed of sandstone ashlar in the form of a circular Ionic temple on a 3-step podium with a colonnade of 16 unfluted Ionic columns supporting an entablature. The Rotunda The Black Fen lies a mile from the house. From the Rotunda six straight paths lead to other features of the estate. Legacy Bramham Island on the north side of Queen Charlotte Strait in the Central Coast region of British Columbia, Canada, was named after Bramham Park. Named in association with it were Slingsby Channel, on its north side, and the Fox Islands, which lie in the entrance to that channel at its opening into Queen Charlotte Strait. It became the filming location of the third series of The Syndicate in 2014; the manor was used as the fictional Hazelwood manor.

It was discovered during the Palomar‚ÄìLeiden Trojan survey on 26 March 1971, by Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, and Tom Gehrels at Palomar Observatory in California, United States. The likely elongated S-type asteroid has a brightness variation of 0.56 magnitude. It was named after Heidi Graf, a former Head of the ESTEC Communications Office.  Orbit and classification  Heidigraf is a core member of the Koronis family (), a very large outer asteroid family of six thousand known members with nearly co-planar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.7‚Äì3.1 AU once every 4 years and 10 months (1,760 days; semi-major axis of 2.85 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Palomar on 24 March 1971, two nights prior to its official discovery observation.  Palomar‚ÄìLeiden Trojan survey  The survey designation \\"T-1\\" stands for the first Palomar‚ÄìLeiden Trojan survey, named after the fruitful collaboration of the Palomar and Leiden Observatory in the 1960s and 1970s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand asteroid discoveries.  Physical characteristics  Heidigraf is an assumed stony S-type asteroid, which is the overall spectral type of the Koronis family.  Rotation period  In January 2014, astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory observed Heidigraf photometrically in the R-band during which it showed a brightness amplitude of 0.56 magnitude, indicative for a non-spheroidal shape. However no rotational lightcurve could be constructed an its rotation period remains unknown.  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Heidigraf measures 5.782 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.331 and 0.4007, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 and calculates a diameter of 5.15 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 13.61.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Heidi Graf (born 1941), former Head of the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) Communications Office from 1977 to 2006 at the European Space Agency, ESA. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 9 November 2006 ().

It was created primarily due to the efforts of David Lubin. In 1930, the IIA published the first world agricultural census. After World War II, both its assets and mandate were handed over to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. History In 1904 the idea of such an institute came to David Lubin of Sacramento, California, and his project found favor with the king of Italy. The latter gave a building in Rome and an annual income of $60,000. The king called the first congress in 1906, and delegates attended from 40 countries. At the congress, a treaty was formed making the institute a permanent organization and defining its scope and activities. This work in turn cites Senate Document No. 196, 63d Congress, First Session (Washington 1913). Government The government of the IIA was vested in the general assembly of delegates from affiliated countries, meeting every two years, and in a permanent executive committee, on which there was one representative from each country. This permanent committee had direct charge of the IIA. The general officers were the president (also chairman of the permanent committee), the vice president and the secretary general. The work of the institute was divided among four bureaus: #Bureau of the secretary general had charge of the personnel, financial and other routine business, the building and its equipment, the printing and distribution of publications, the library and general bibliographical work, and, as a more recent service, the preparation and publication of an annual compilation of agricultural legislation in the different countries of the world. #Bureau of general statistics collected, collated and published statistics of production and commerce in agricultural products, both animal and vegetable, throughout the world. #Bureau of agricultural intelligence and plant diseases collected and published information regarding the progress of scientific and experimental investigations and practical experience in agriculture throughout the world and, as a branch of this work, gives special attention to the diseases of plants and to entomology. #Bureau of economic and social institutions collected and published statistics and general information regarding agricultural co-operation, insurance and credit, together with other matters relating to the economic and social organization of rural communities. The annual budget of the institute was $250,000 (c. 1915), contributed by the adhering governments on the basis of a number of units assigned to each country. Publications Those publications of the IIA which had a bearing on the formation of the price of the staples (such as crop reports and data on exports, imports and stocks) were based exclusively on official information, supplied direct to the institute by the adhering governments. Other publications were produced from (a) information officially communicated by the governments, (b) original articles contributed by eminent authorities designated by the adhering governments, (c) excerpts and abstracts of articles translated from the 2,225 official and unofficial periodical publications of the world received by the IIA. The IIA printed and published two annuals and three monthly and one weekly bulletins, together with a considerable number of monographs on special subjects. The annuals dealt with agricultural statistics and legislation, respectively. The monthly bulletins were on (a) agricultural statistics (b) agricultural intelligence and diseases of plants, and (c) economic and social institutions, and the weekly bulletin is bibliographical. The monthly bulletins were published in French, German, English, Spanish, Italian and Hungarian. French being the official language of the IIA, the editions in that language were paid for from the funds of the Institute. Provision for the edition in the other languages was made by the countries interested. The congress of the United States made an annual appropriation of $5,000 (c. 1915) for translating and printing the English edition, the rest of the expense being borne by Great Britain and her colonies. Library The IIA collected a great library of agricultural literature. As the IIA became more firmly established and its value as an international clearing house on economic information was more generally recognized, it was met with a constantly increasing demand for the extension of its service along many lines. After the IIA ceased operations in 1945, its library collection was transferred to David Lubin Memorial Library (DLML) of the FAO. The DLML is open to external visitors.

Aaron Tippin signs with Rust Records Country Standard Time, June 20, 2006 and Shane Owens. Origins Ken Cooper started Rust Records as a way to promote his band rock band Vertigogo. Upon the band's major label signing to Atlantic Records and change of the band's name to Sinomatic due to infringement upon a recording group from France, Rust Records again went onto the back burner. Shortly after the release of Sinomatic's debut album however, the band fell apart in early 2002 and was subsequently dropped by their label. Ken Cooper returned to his roots, once again thinking about his recording company in early 2003. The first release on the label was a rock band called Dear Violet, once again with Ken Cooper as the frontman. In 2004 Cooper retired from performing, began to focus on the label full-time. VP of Operations Keith Simmerer was brought on board, and proved to be the only other person to stay with the company over the course of its run. Starting with the alternative rock group Cherry Monroe, Rust became a Universal Imprint and was among the first labels to sign a deal with the then new Fontana Distribution company. They then released records by other local artists Between Home and Serenity, Blush, View From Everest, Southcott, and Lareau before venturing into country music with artist Shane Owens. Present day In 2005, Rust Records made the move from Cleveland, OH, to Nashville, TN, where the company made a major change: it switched genres from rock & roll to country. In 2005, the band signed emerging artists The Povertyneck Hillbillies and Shane Owens. In 2006, Rust signed a partnership agreement with Aaron Tippin to release his work in partnership with his startup label Nippit Records and trio BlackHawk, who came over after being dropped from Columbia Records. In January 2007, Rust Records closed its doors due to issues with its financial partners. All artists were released from their recording obligations at that time.

The post was created by the Marian reforms. Its holder stood just below the legatus legionis, the legion's commander, and above the other five tribuni angusticlavii (and later the praefectus castrorum). The position was the first step of the traditional cursus honorum, the sequence of public offices held by Roman nobles of the senatorial class (conversely, the tribuni angusticlavii were knights). The tribunus laticlavius would usually be a young man who might belong to one of the richest families in Rome or be a close friend to the legionary commander. After two or three years in the army he would go back to Rome and run for a political office, usually a quaestorship. By the middle of 250s AD, at the earliest, the post of the tribunus laticlavius had disappeared from the Roman army, following the general trend of removal of the senatorial class from military commands. The Tribunus Laticlavius has a chance of being a future senator, and commander of an entire legion.http://www.vimeo.com/31781946  References  Category:Military ranks of ancient Rome ","title":"Tribunus laticlavius"},{"id":"10158330","text":"Friends & Relatives is a compilation album released by Eagle Records in 1999.

After serving in different locations in India, he took part as chief engineer in the First Anglo-Afghan War. Here he was ordered to destroy the great bazaar of Kabul as a retribution for the murder of a British officer, an action he later regretted. In 1841, Abbott was appointed superintending engineer of the north-western provinces of Bengal. He fought in the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846, and took part in the Battle of Sobraon, for which he was awarded a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He retired one year later and took over as lieutenant-governor of Addiscombe Seminary in 1851. Abbott became a knight bachelor in 1854 and was promoted to Major-General in 1858.

A temple has been constructed at west end of the town in order to create a place for worshipping for the locals. Sunday is the only weekday on which the temple remains open. People from far away places visit the goddess. Maa Pendrani of Umerkote is born out of a legend. A small village Pendra (Pendrahandi) near Umerkote worship a pure soul Pendrani, a married girl who was a victim of secret jealousy of her own brothers. As the story goes, her husband was overtly pampered by her parents who made him stay in their household with no work to bother about. The four brothers out of sheer jealousy conspired and succeeded in killing her innocent husband (Pendara) and buried him in their field. Sensing a foul play, Pendrani could unfold the heinous crime and apparently jumped into her husband‚Äôs funeral pyre and perished in its flames. Days later her spirit was believed to roam about the villages helping those who trusted her supernatural transformation. People adore her sacrifice and worship in a temple erected at Umerkote. That the local degree College is named after her is a tribute to the saga of supreme sacrifice. Her holy grace attracts many people from surrounding locations. During the time of Ratha Yatra at Umerkote, people celebrate the annual fair near the temple. People from nearby villages come and visit the celebration which includes bazaars and mandi and exchange of cultural factors among tribal and urban people. The Goddess had been worshipped on an open citadel which gradually has been made with a normal wooden chamber. With the help of locals a newly built temple has been dedicated for worshipping the goddess with a grand inaugural celebration from 20 to 30 June 2010. Another legend related to the origin of Maa Pendrani is as follows: Goddess Pendragarhien, also known as Pendrani is worshipped by the tribal people of Western Odisha and the bordering districts of Chhattisgarh. It has a history of last 400 years. A myth of origin of Goddess Pendrani; followed by a complex ritual, is found in these areas. The focal theme of the myth was about a Gond bride Pendrani; whose husband (bride service) was killed by her seven brothers in order to get good harvest by offering human sacrifice to Earth Mother Goddess. Pendrani, searched for her husband and finally found that her own brothers had sacrificed her bride service- husband. While wondering in the forest a tiger ate her and after that her spirit became a Goddess. Over a period of last 400 years she has transformed from a revengeful goddess into a blissful goddess. She is now worshipped as the Goddess of wealth in Western Odisha and eastern Chhattisgarh. The purpose of the article is to explain how an ordinary woman became a Goddess and contested against the male predominance. Her creation myth became so popular that she became a popular Goddess and thus a new cult emerged as Pendrani Goddess cult. Though originated as a tribal Goddess she became the Goddess of both tribal and non tribal communities in the socio historical process of the region. The cult represented with the religious faith and belief explores that now Pendrani is one of the most popular and prestigious Goddess. A huge temple is constructed in Umerkote town, in addition to installation of her cult in thousands of villages in tribal areas. An attempt has been made in this paper to examine the socio‚Äìhistorical processes of the indigenous communities and the dynamics of transformation of a woman to goddess in the collective memory of the communities. The ritual performance of the celebration and adoption of the Goddess in a house or in a village is a complex ritual process that captures the socio‚Äìpsychological phenomena. Male shamans use to play the role of the Goddess and the divinization of Pendrani Goddess is established. The inference of the Pendrani cult is a contestation of male predominance over the women and the whole ritual system adopted in the cult, celebrated by the males playing the role of female goddess signifies the males subjugation to the woman Goddess, thereby compensating the injustice inflicted on Goddess Pendrani when she was an ordinary woman; before her deification.

It was described by Heinrich Kuhl in 1820, and two subspecies are recognised. The species is unusually coloured for a rosella, with a dark head and neck with pale cheeks‚Äîpredominantly white in the nominate subspecies from the Northern Territory and blue in the Western Australian subspecies hillii. The northern rosella's mantle and scapulars are black with fine yellow scallops, while its back, rump and underparts are pale yellow with fine black scallops. The long tail is blue-green and the wings are black and blue-violet. The sexes have similar plumage, while females and younger birds are generally duller with occasional spots of red. Found in woodland and open savannah country, the northern rosella is predominantly herbivorous, consuming seeds, particularly of grasses and eucalypts, as well as flowers and berries, but it may also eat insects. Nesting takes place in tree hollows. Although uncommon, the northern rosella is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.  Taxonomy and naming  The northern rosella was first described as Psittacus venustus by German naturalist Heinrich Kuhl in 1820. The description was based on an illustration by Ferdinand Bauer from a specimen collected by Robert Brown in February 1803, during Matthew Flinders' voyage around the Australian coastline. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin venustus \\"charming, lovely or graceful\\". Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck published the name Psittacus brownii in honour of Brown in 1821, and Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors transferred it (as P. brownii) to the genus Platycercus in 1827, describing it as the \\"most beautiful of the family\\". But John Gould wrote in his 1865 work Handbook to the Birds of Australia, \\"Hitherto this bird has been known to ornithologists as Platycercus brownii, a specific appellation in honour of the celebrated botanist; but which, I regret to say, must give place to the prior one of venustus.\\" Painting by Ferdinand Bauer c. 1811‚Äì1813 Gregory Mathews described the subspecies P. venustus hillii in 1910, collected by G.F. Hill from Napier Broome Bay in Western Australia. He noted that its cheeks had more blue and less white than the nominate subspecies. The Victoria River marks the border between this and the nominate subspecies. Animal taxonomist Arthur Cain treated the subspecies as synonymous to the nominate as the only difference he knew of was the colour of the cheeks, but conceded further evidence could prove them distinct. As well as the differences in cheek plumage, the two differ in that subspecies hillii has brighter yellow feathers on the breast and belly with thinner black edges, and a consistently longer and wider bill. A subspecies, P. venustus melvillensis from Melville Island, was described by Mathews in 1912, noting it to have blacker plumage on its back. It is now thought to be indistinguishable from the nominate subspecies. \\"Northern rosella\\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). Early names used include Brown's rosella, parrot or parakeet for its collector, with Brown's parakeet remaining a name used in aviculture in Europe and the United Kingdom, and smutty rosella, parrot or parakeet, from its dark plumage. Gould reported in 1848 that the latter was the local name used, and it was the most common name at the end of the 19th century. It was changed‚Äîpossibly through bowdlerisation‚Äîto sooty parrot by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) in 1913. Bulawirdwird and Djaddokorddokord are two names from the Kunwinjku language of the western Arnhem Land. One of six species of rosella in the genus Platycercus, the northern rosella and related eastern (P. eximius) and pale-headed rosella (P. adscitus) make up a \\"white-cheeked\\" lineage. A 1987 genetic study on mitochondrial DNA by Ovenden and colleagues found that the northern rosella was the earliest offshoot (basal) of a lineage that gave rise to the other white-cheeked forms. But a study with nuclear DNA by Ashlee Shipham and colleagues published in 2017 found that the eastern rosella was basal to the lineage that split into the pale-headed and northern rosellas, and hence, that non-sister taxa were able to hybridise among the rosellas.  Description  subspecies hillii, Western Australia Smaller than all rosella species except the western rosella, the adult northern rosella weighs and is long. It has broad wings with a wingspan of around , and a long tail with twelve feathers. The sexes are almost indistinguishable, though some adult females have duller plumage and are more likely to have some red feathers on the head and breast. The adult bird has a black forehead, crown, lores, ear coverts, upper neck and nape, a whitish throat and large cheek-patches, which are mainly white with violet lower borders in the nominate subspecies, and more blue with a narrow white upper segment in subspecies hillii. The feathers of the lower neck, mantle and scapulars are black narrowly fringed with yellow, giving a scalloped appearance, while the feathers of the back, rump, upper tail coverts and underparts are pale yellow with black borders and concealed grey bases. Those of the breast have very dark grey bases, occasionally tinged with red. The undertail covert feathers are red with black fringes. The feathers on the upper leg are pale yellow tinged with blue. The central rectrices of the long tail are dark green changing to dark blue at the tips, while the other feathers are dark blue with two bands of pale blue and white tips. The undertail is pale blue with a white tip. The wings have a wide purplish blue shoulder patch at rest, with the secondary feathers edged darker blue and the primaries black edged with blue. The beak is off-white with a grey cere, the legs and feet are grey, and the iris is dark brown. Immature birds resemble adults but are duller overall, with less-well defined cheek patches. The black plumage in particular is more greyish and there are more likely to be scattered red feathers on the head, neck and underparts. Distribution and habitat The northern rosella is found across northern Australia. In Western Australia, it is found across the Kimberley south to the 18th parallel, around Derby, Windjana Gorge National Park, the northern Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges, Springvale Station and Warmun, with vagrants reported at Halls Creek and Fitzroy Crossing. In the Northern Territory it is found from Victoria River north to the Tiwi Islands and east into western Arnhem Land, and across northern Arnhem Land through Milingimbi Island and the Wessel Islands to the Gove Peninsula. It is absent from central Arnhem Land, but is found further east around the western and southern coastline of the Gulf of Carpentaria, south to Borroloola and across the border into western Queensland as far as the Nicholson River. The northern rosella lives in grassy open forests and woodlands, including deciduous eucalypt savannah woodlands. Typical trees include species of Eucalyptus, such as Darwin stringybark (Eucalyptus tetrodonta), Melaleuca, Callitris and Acacia. More specific habitats include vegetation along small creeks and gorges, sandstone outcrops and escarpments, as well as some forested offshore islands. The northern rosella is occasionally found in mangroves or public green spaces in suburban Darwin. It avoids dense forest. Behaviour Not a gregarious bird, the northern rosella is generally found alone or in pairs, although several birds perch together in the same tree. Sometimes they are encountered in larger troops‚Äîusually 6 to 8 birds but rarely up to 15 individuals. It is shyer than other rosellas, and flees to the upper tree canopy if disturbed. It is a quieter and less vocal species than other rosellas, and its call repertoire has been little studied. It exhibits a sharp and short chit-chut chit-chut contact call in flight; while perched it makes a three-note whistle on ascending scale or metallic piping sounds. Soft chattering can be heard while feeding, and sometimes when squabbling at the beginning of breeding season. Breeding Nesting occurs in tree hollows in the Southern Hemisphere winter, often in eucalypts located near water. The clutch is anywhere from two to five white matte or slightly glossy eggs, measuring roughly 26 x 21 mm (1 x 0.8 in). The female incubates the eggs alone, over a period of 19 or 20 days. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white down and are largely helpless (nidicolous). They may remain in the nest for seven weeks after hatching and are fed by both parents. Fledglings remain with their parents for a year or more, often feeding together in small family groups. Feeding The northern rosella feeds on the ground in grassy glades in woodlands, on roadsides, riverbanks, as well as in the canopy of trees. It eats seeds, particularly those of eucalypts, wattles, cypress (Callitris intratropica) and grasses. It eats both the seeds and nectar of white gum (Eucalyptus alba), Darwin stringybark, long-fruited bloodwood (Corymbia polycarpa), fibrebark (Melaleuca nervosa) and fern-leaved grevillea (Grevillea pteridifolia). It also eats flowers, such as those of Darwin woollybutt (Eucalyptus miniata), and fruit. It also eats larval and adult insects. Predation and parasites The northern rosella is a prey item of the rufous owl (Ninox rufa). The bird louse Forficuloecus wilsoni has been recovered from the northern rosella. Conservation status A pair in captivity with prominent blue cheeks The northern rosella is listed as being a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), on account of its large range and stable population, with no evidence of any significant decline. Despite this, the northern rosella is an uncommon bird. Grazing by livestock and frequent burning of grassy woodland may have a negative impact on northern rosella numbers. Like most species of parrots, the northern rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. Aviculture Most northern rosellas in captivity in Australia are the nominate subspecies, but there are blue-cheeked specimens that are either subspecies hillii or intermediate. Its attractive colours make it a desirable species to keep. In captivity in the Northern Hemisphere, the northern rosella has been reported to breed in the same calendar months as it does in its Southern Hemisphere native range. As it breeds early in the season, clutches laid in cooler months of cooler Australian states may fail. Breeders have attempted to use sprinklers in enclosures to induce pairs to breed at other times.

She developed a passion for music since she was a teenager, her favorite singers being, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Joni Mitchell, Michelle Shocked, Tom Waits, Lucio Battisti, and The Beatles . She studied at Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milan, where, during a student protest in 1990, she met Manuel Agnelli, leader of the Italian indie rock band Afterhours. Later she started her own singing career opening Afterhours‚Äô concerts in their During Christine's Sleep tour. Besides live performances in clubs in Milano and surroundings, Don√†, encouraged by Manuel Agnelli, began working on her own songs, and released her first album, Tregua, in 1997. The album was an immediate success. Robert Wyatt included it among his favorites of the year in Mojo . The music critic Charlie Gillett broadcast some songs on BBC radio. In the meanwhile Don√† performed live on an Italian tour, and opened concerts for Ben Harper and David Byrne. In 1999 she duetted with the songwriter Eric Wood in his album Illustrated night, and started working on the second album, Nido. Robert Wyatt contributed to this album with the arrangements in the song Goccia and with the participation in a videoclip, shot on the East Coast of England, and released on the Goccia EP. In 2001 Don√† was invited (the first and only Italian artist then) to the Meltdown Festival, where she performed the same night as Anja Garbarek and Mark Eitzel. Davey Ray Moor, attending the concert that night, was very much impressed by Don√†‚Äôs performance, and this was the starting point of a long-lasting collaboration between the two artists. While working with him on the third album, in January 2002 Don√† was invited to participate in the Eurosonic Festival in Groningen (The Netherlands). The third album, Dove sei tu, was released in 2003, and Davey Ray Moor performed as a special guest in some concerts during the promotional tour. Don√† recorded a cover of Kate Bush‚Äôs Wuthering Heights, which was included in the single Invisibile. She also worked, together with Davey Ray Moor, on the translation of the lyrics of Dove sei tu. The self-titled album was released in 2004 and distributed in 33 countries by Rykodisc International. The English press welcomed the album with very good reviews. Mojo gives it four stars, Down Beat compared Don√† to artists such as Marianne Faithfull and Ute Lemper, Sunday Times included a song in the monthly CD attached to the magazine. At the end of 2004 she started an extensive tour of Europe, performing in Germany, France, UK, Belgium, The Netherlands, Sweden, and with a special performance at the Polar Spectacle Festival in Norway. The American musician Ken Stringfellow played with her in most of the European concerts. In 2005 she played in Italy with Annie Whitehead‚Äôs Soupsongs, and was in the UK for an acoustic tour, during which she was invited to Robert Elms‚Äô BBC London Live. In 2006 she signed to the major label EMI that is re-distributing all her catalogue. In 2014 she came back from her last album Torno A Casa A Piedi (2011) with a new work called Cos√¨ Vicini.

It was originally broadcast on BBC Two in 1995. In the series, Curtis examines the different ways that history and memory (both national and individual) have been used and manipulated by politicians and others. Summary of episodes=Part 1. 'On the Desperate Edge of Now' This episode, broadcast on 30 May 1995, examines how the various national ideals and memories of the Second World War were effectively buried, rewritten and manipulated in the Cold War era, only to violently resurface later with events such as the protests of 1968, the emergence of the Red Army Faction, and the turmoil of the Yugoslav Wars. For Germany, this process began at the Nuremberg Trials, where the use of the film The Nazi Plan was intended to reveal the criminality of the Nazi state, and attempts were made to prevent defendants‚Äîprincipally Hermann G√∂ring‚Äîfrom providing any rational or contextualized argument for their actions during the war. Subsequently, however, bringing lower-ranking Nazis to justice was all but forgotten in the interests of maintaining West Germany as an important new ally in the Cold War. For the Allies, faced with a new enemy in the Soviet Union, there was a need to portray World War II as a crusade of pure good against pure evil, even if this meant creating a mismatch by denying the memories of the individual soldiers who had actually done the fighting and knew it to have been far more ambiguous. The title of this episode comes from a veteran's description of the uncertainty of survival in combat. A number of American veterans related how, years later, they found themselves plagued with previously-suppressed memories of the brutal things they had seen and done. = Contributors = * Louis Simpson, Private in US Airborne Division 1943‚Äì45 * Paul Fussell, infantryman in US Army 1944‚Äì45 * Frau Witta and Frau Torman, housekeepers at Carinhall * Utz Ulrich, Curator, Nuremberg museum * Carlo Jahn, Gatekeeper of Congress Hall, Nuremberg * Herr Fruehwirt, member of the Hitler Youth 1933‚Äì41 * Peter Uiberall, Goering's interpreter at Nuremberg trials * Burton C.

'You Have Used Me as a Fish Long Enough' In this episode, broadcast on 6 June 1995, the early history of the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) use of brainwashing and mind control is examined. Its thesis is that a search for control over the past, via medical intervention, had to be abandoned, and that in modern times, control over the past is more effectively exercised by the manipulation of history. It concludes that despite successful attempts to remove memories of the past, doing so often left an emotional void that was hard to refill. The angle pursued by Curtis is the way in which psychiatry historically pursued tabula rasa theories of the mind, initially to set people free from traumatic memories and then later as a potential instrument of societal control. The work of Ewen Cameron is surveyed, with particular reference to the early medical use of electroconvulsive therapy, Cold War theories of communist brainwashing, and the search for hypnoprogammed sleeper agents and assassins. After the intelligence agency failures over the Kennedy assassination and the failed assassination attempts against Fidel Castro, this work was later abandoned in favour of computerised memory and intelligence research, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), created in 1958. The title of this episode comes from a paranoid schizophrenic seen in archive film in the programme, who believed that her neighbours were using her as a source of amusement by denying her any privacy‚Äîlike a goldfish in a bowl. Some footage from this episode, an interview with one of Cameron's victims, was later reused by Curtis in The Century of the Self. = Contributors = * Joy Shannon, Administrator, Montreal Neurological Institute * Dr Herb Jasper, assistant to Wilder Penfield * Dr Heinz Lehmann, psychiatrist and colleague of Dr Cameron * Dr Peter Roper, psychiatrist at Allan Memorial Institute * Thomas Polgar, CIA Assistant Chief of Station in Berlin 1949‚Äì55 * Dr John Gittinger, CIA Chief Psychologist 1950‚Äì74 * Milton Kline, psychologist and adviser to CIA * Laughlin Taylor, assistant to Dr Cameron 1958‚Äì60 * Linda MacDonald, former patient of Dr Cameron * Jerome Bruner, cognitive psychologist, 1950s * John Marks, former assistant to CIA Director of Intelligence and Research * Victor Marchetti, CIA officer 1955‚Äì69 * Gray Lynch, CIA officer, 1960s * William Alexander, Assistant District Attorney, Dallas 1963 * Yuri Nosenko, KGB defector * Colonel Yuri Modin, KGB officer 1947‚Äì80 * Ulric Neisser, cognitive psychologist, 1960s * Robert Cooper, Director of ARPA 1981‚Äì85 * Marvin Minsky, artificial intelligence scientist, MIT * Gary Chapman, historian of artificial intelligence * Robert Simpson, Projects Officer at ARPA 1985‚Äì90 * Marco Lloyd, platoon commander in the Gulf War Part 3. 'The Attic' In this episode, broadcast on 13 June 1995, the national aspirations of Margaret Thatcher are examined, particularly the way in which she used public sentiment in an attempt to capture the national spirit embodied in the famous speeches and writings of the wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill. Curtis argues that by harking back, or summoning the spirit of Britain's \\"glorious past\\", to fulfil short-term political or national ends, the process backfired in the long-run, trapping the invoker in the societal maladies of the present day. The example provided is the wartime levels of patriotism invoked in the Falklands War crisis, in which Thatcher's rugged determination matched national sentiment, only to dissipate a few years later with events such as the poll tax riots, which contributed to her resignation. The title is a reference to the attic flat at the top of 10 Downing Street created during Thatcher's refurbishment of the house which did away with the prime minister's old living quarters on the lower floors, replacing them with 18th-century boardrooms. Scenes from Thatcher's premiership are intercut with scenes from the psychological horror film The Innocents (1961), a film adaptation of Henry James's novella The Turn of the Screw. = Contributors = * Colonel Peter Storey-Pugh, prisoner in Colditz 1940‚Äì45 * Sir Stephen Hastings M.C., Conservative MP 1960‚Äì63 * Sir Carol Mather M.C., Conservative MP 1970‚Äì87 * Colonel Robert Butler * Airey Neave MP (speaking in 1978) * Sir Ronald Millar, speech-writer for Mrs Thatcher 1975‚Äì90 * Patrick Cosgrave, adviser to Mrs Thatcher 1975‚Äì79 * Sir Tim Bell, M.D. Saatchi & Saatchi 1970-85 * Rt Hon.

The group consisting of Ben-J (from Les Neg'Marrons), Lino and Calbo (from the group √Ñrsenik), Doc and G Kill (from 2Bal), Mystik and the only female M'Passi was put together by French rapper Passi. The group created an album called Racines which means 'Roots' in French. The album contained a fusion of hip hop with African rhythms and sounds like rumba, zouk and soukous giving it a unique and distinctive flavour. The album also featured collaborations with prominent African musicians of the time like Koffi Olomide, Papa Wemba, Ismael Lo, Kassav and Monique Seka.MCM Article (French) Many French rappers such as those that comprise the group Bisso Na Bisso, describe their desire to both foster solidarity among Blacks and demonstrate their pride in Africa, while simultaneously acknowledging their roots in an Urban French context. This identity struggle represented in French rap music is further complicated by the fact that black rappers in France struggle to create a presence in the film industry and on television where French Blacks receive little exposure and being white opens doors to many more opportunities. Rappers report their feelings of disconnect from both their homelands and from their present homes where they are unable to adequately use the media to portray the inequality in French society.Helenon, Veronique. ‚ÄúAfrica on Their Mind: Rap, Blackness, and Citizenship in France.‚Äù In The Vinyl Ain‚Äôt Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J.

It is known for the Bagh Caves, which are late 4th- to 6th-century Buddhist rock-cut chambers with murals. The name of the town stems from the caves - according to local legend there were living tigers (bagh in several languages of India) in these abandoned Buddhist caves. The town is also known for a type of block prints on fabric, known as Bagh prints.  History  In 1982, a hoard of 27 inscriptions issued by the Maharajas of Valkha was discovered at Risawala near Bagh. The inscriptions were issued from a place known as Valkha, which has led to suggestions that the name \\"Bagh\\" is derived from \\"Valkha\\". The inscriptions are dated to the years 38-134 of an unspecified calendar era. Historians D. C. Sircar and R. C. Majumdar theorized that the Maharajas of Valkha were subordinates to the Guptas, and the calendar era used in their inscription is the Gupta era starting from 319 CE. Thus, the Maharajas of Valkha can be dated to 4th and 5th centuries CE. The next known ruler of the region is Maharaja Subandhu of Mahishmati. His Bagh Caves inscription is dated 167 (486 CE, assuming Gupta era). Art historian Walter M. Spink has identified Subandhu as the prince Vishruta mentioned in Dashakumaracharita. According to his theory, Subandhu or Vishruta was a Gupta prince, who established the dynasty that later came to be known as Kalachuri.

Conceptually similar to a railroad switch in function, a kicker magnet must switch on very rapidly, then maintain a stable magnetic field for some minimum time. Switch-off time is also important, but less critical. An injection kicker magnet merges two beams incoming from different directions. Most commonly, there is a beam circulating in a synchrotron, in the form of a particle train which only partially fills the arc. As soon as the circulating particle train has passed the kicker, it is switched on so that an additional batch of particles may be appended to the train. The magnet must then be switched off in time to not affect the head of the train when it next rounds the synchrotron. An ejection kicker magnet does the opposite, diverting a circulating beam so it leaves the synchrotron. Almost always, an ejection kicker is used to eject the entire particle train, emptying the synchrotron. This means that it has the entire tail-to-head gap in the synchrotron to function, and the switch-off time is essentially irrelevant. However, it must hold a stable field for longer (one full rotation of the synchrotron), and must generate a stronger magnetic field, as it is used to eject a higher energy beam that has been accelerated in the synchrotron. The magnets are powered by a high voltage (usually in the range of tens of thousands of volts) source called a power modulator which uses a pulse forming network to produce a short pulse of current (usually in the range of a few nanoseconds to a microsecond and thousands of amperes in amplitude). The current produces a magnetic field in the magnet, which in turn imparts a Lorentz force on the particles as they traverse the magnet's length, causing the beam to deflect into the proper trajectory. Because a kicker magnet applies a particular lateral impulse to the beam, to achieve a fixed deflection angle the strength of the kick must be accurately matched to the momentum of the particles. This is part of the power modulator's job.

It was, until 1998, part of Kent and is still ceremonially associated via the Lieutenancies Act. The A228 goes through the village. Origins Chattenden means 'Forest Settlement' from the elements ceto and ham dun. It is recorded in 1100 as Chetindunam, and Chatindone in 1281.The Place Names Of Kent, Judith Glover, 1976, Batsford. Geography and ecology Turning left on the A228 on the brow of Four Elms Hill, leads onto Kitchener Road, that eventually leads itself to Chattenden Woods and Lodge Hill, designated as an SSSI, due to the diversity of insects, birds, plants and trees found there. To the south of Chattenden is Towerhill Wood, also known as Coxham Wood, with has Public Footpaths that lead into Lower Upnor, where the Arethusa Venture Centre and the Medway Yacht Club (MYC) are located. Along the A228, (which becomes the Ratcliffe Highway in Chattenden), was once a pub known as 'The Old George'. Military history In 1875, the War Office built five magazines on a hillside at Chattenden. This facility expanded and a nearby site at Lodge Hill was established in 1899. These sites, which became known as Chattenden and Lodge Hill Military Camps, were put up for sale in 2016.

Like other buttonquails, it is unrelated to the true quails. The black-breasted buttonquail is a plump quail-shaped bird of predominantly marbled black, rufous and pale brown, marked prominently with white spots and stripes, and white eyes. Like other buttonquails, the female is larger and more distinctively coloured than the male. Measuring up to 20 cm (8 in), it has a black face and chin, sprinkled with fine white markings. The smaller male measures up to 18 cm (7.5 in) and lacks the black markings. The black-breasted buttonquail is rated as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species. Taxonomy The black-breasted buttonquail was originally described by ornithologist John Gould in 1837 as Hemipodius melanogaster, from specimens collected around Moreton Bay in Queensland. Its specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek terms melas \\"black\\", and gaster \\"belly\\". In 1840, English zoologist George Robert Gray established that the genus name Turnix, coined in 1790 by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre, had priority over Hemipodius, which had been published in 1815 by Coenraad Jacob Temminck. In his 1865 Handbook to the Birds of Australia, Gould used its current name Turnix melanogaster. Along with other buttonquails, the black-breasted buttonquail was traditionally placed in the order Gruiformes, but more recent molecular analysis shows it belongs to an ancient lineage of shorebirds (Charadriiformes). \\"Black-breasted buttonquail\\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). \\"Black-fronted buttonquail\\" is an alternative vernacular name. Gould called it \\"black- breasted hemipode\\" initially, and then \\"black-breasted turnix\\", corresponding with its scientific name. The buttonquail species were generally known as \\"quail\\" (hence \\"black-breasted quail\\" or \\"black-fronted quail\\") until the RAOU promoted the current usage of \\"buttonquail\\" in 1978, which was then universally adopted. Description The black-breasted buttonquail is a plump quail-shaped bird of predominantly marbled black, rufous and pale brown, marked prominently with white spots and stripes, and white eyes. Like other buttonquails, the female is larger and more distinctively coloured than the male. Measuring up to 20 cm (8 in), it has a black face and chin, sprinkled with fine white markings. The smaller male measures up to 19 cm (7.5 in) and lacks the black markings. The black markings and large size of the female and the dark markings and whitish face of the male distinguish the species from the painted buttonquail (Turnix varius). The female makes a low-pitched oom call. The male utters an ak ak call when separated from others in its covey. The globular pellets of the black-breasted buttonquail have a distinctive hook at the end, in contrast to those of the co-occurring painted buttonquail, which are more cylindrical and gently curved. Distribution and habitat The black-breasted buttonquail is found from Hervey Bay in central Queensland south to the northeastern corner of New South Wales, generally in areas receiving 770‚Äì1200 mm (30‚Äì48 in) rainfall annually. It is rare and its habitat is fragmented. It is found in dry rainforest and nearby areas, as well as bottle tree (Brachychiton rupestris) scrub, lantana thickets. and mature hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) plantations with a closed canopy and developed undergrowth. It is found in Palmgrove National Park, which has consequently been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area for the species. The black-breasted buttonquail was once populous on Inskip Point near Fraser Island, with the area a destination for birdwatchers wanting to see this species. However, there were fears that they had suffered predation. Mike West, former president of Birds Queensland, blamed dingoes and wild dogs for wiping out the population. However, as of early 2014, Queensland Parks and Wildlife staff believe that at least two pairs are still present at Inskip Point. Breeding The breeding habits of the species are not well known as both the birds and their nests are difficult to find and monitor. The usual sex roles are reversed in the buttonquail genus (Turnix), as the larger and more brightly-coloured female mates with multiple male partners and leaves them to incubate the eggs. For most of the year, the female black-breasted buttonquail forms a covey with one to three males. During breeding season, the female establishes a territory and utters drumming calls as courtship. The males often form small territories within the female's. The nest is a shallow depression measuring 10 cm by 6 cm scraped out of the leaf litter and ground, lined with leaves, moss and dried vegetation. It is often sited between the buttress roots of a plant, or in a crevice or sheltered by a tree root, and within or near undergrowth vegetation such as lantana (Lantana camara), bracken (Pteridium esculentum) or prickly rasp fern (Doodia aspera). It is not known which sex builds the nest. Three or four shiny grey-white or buff eggs splotched with dark brown-black and lavender are laid measuring 28 mm x 23 mm. Incubation lasts 18 to 21 days. Feeding The black-breasted buttonquail forages on the ground in large areas of thick leaf litter in vine forest, and thickets of vines or lantana. Leaves fall on these areas year-round. A covey of birds scrapes out up to 100 plate-shaped shallow feeding sites, though between 10 and 40 is more usual. The buttonquail makes these by scratching at the ground with alternate legs in a circular pattern moving either clockwise or anticlockwise, creating the 20 cm depression and pecking for invertebrates in the exposed ground. Remains of prey recovered from pellets include the exoskeletons of ants, beetles (including weevils), spiders such as jumping spiders and the brown trapdoor spider (Euoplos variabilis), centipedes, millipedes, and snails such as Nitor pudibunda. The remains of soft-bodied invertebrates are not discernible in pellets. Conservation status The species was classified as vulnerable until 2012 when it relisted as near threatened; most of the black-breasted buttonquail's original habitat has been cleared and the remaining populations are fragmented. The population has been estimated at as little as 2500 breeding birds and declining, with no single population containing more than 250 individuals. The dry rainforest it lives in, although often adjacent to wet rainforest, is often located outside of national parks and protected areas and is thus at risk from further clearance for agriculture or development. Since European settlement, 90% of its habitat has been lost and much of what is left is fragmented. Furthermore, fieldwork in southeast Queensland showed that it did not forage in remnants under 7 hectares in area. It is listed as vulnerable in Queensland and listed as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.IUCN Redlist, n.d.

Functional quality reproductions even when produced in series may be priced in the USD/EUR 1,000 to 2,000 range or above, while cheap factory produced swords may range around USD/EUR 50 to 200. The purpose of the replica may be either exhibition (educational museum replicas, or simply decorative \\"wallhangers\\"), or practical use (historical fencing, combat reenactment, kenjutsu/batt≈çjutsu or test cutting). In the case of decorative replicas, the product need not be able to withstand the physical stress of actual use, resulting in lower cost. Such decorative look-alikes are also pejoratively referred to as \\"sword-like objects\\" (or SLOs) in jargon, especially when falsely advertised. Swords intended for historical fencing on the other hand should ideally come as closely as possible to historical weapons (but remain unsharpened to avoid injury). Swords used for test cutting are sharpened, and are often heavier than their historical counterparts, since added weight improves their cutting effect at the expense of agility (cf. the historical executioner's swords). Swords used for combat reenactment often have rounded points to reduce the risk of injury, and are also often much heavier than their historical counterparts. Anatomy of a sword replica Many cheap modern sword replicas are built for decorative purposes. These are either too brittle or too fragile for any practical use. Materials Historical sword blades are always made of carbon steel alloys, but many replicas are not. Often the choice of blade material has more to do with ease of manufacture or marketing than sword performance. Decorative swords often have low quality stainless steel blades. This is because stainless steel will not rust when on display and lower grades are cheap. A stainless steel blade made of cheaper materiel with a small flaw or a poor heat treatment can be brittle and shatter on impact with a target, potentially resulting in injury to the attacker as well as the target. Some replica swords are nickel or chrome plated to prevent corrosion. This plating is often far shinier than even highly polished carbon steel blades making the swords poor reproductions. The plating itself isn't very durable and can chip or flake if the swords are actually used for anything other than display. Weight and balance Replica swords are generally consumer display items. Blades are often stamped or cut from steel blanks so that they don't taper properly. Shortcuts are often taken with the blade tang and hilt fittings so they rarely counterbalance the blade properly. This often makes for a sword that is both heavier than its historical counterpart and much more blade heavy in terms of balance. Many sword replicas touted as \\"battle ready\\" are also overbuilt making them unhistorically robust and heavy. They will not break even under stress that would destroy a historical sword, but they also lack the proper weight and balance of a historical sword. This makes them unwieldy and unsuited for many types of swordplay. Hilt construction The weakest point of most sword replicas is the hilt or handle. The part of the blade which protrudes into the handle and attaches the two together is called the blade tang. The blade tang transfers impact from the blade to the wielders hands. Many manufactures of replicas use inferior types of tangs, which is one of the most common causes of various forms of breakage or product failure. Historical swords have a tang that was forged as part of the blade, which is hammered through the hilt, or peened; the sword-maker then files the protrusion. Threaded tangs are tangs that, despite having been forged as part of the sword, are inferior since they are screwed into the hilt rather than properly peened. Tab tangs are much shorter than full tangs and often fix the blade to the hilt with friction, glue, or single pin. Rat tail tangs are thin tangs welded to the blade. Partial tangs have a thick blade tang which transitions to a rat tail at some point within the hilt. These less durable tang designs are liable to break or bend when struck against anything. Worse still, the blade can come loose from the handle when the sword is swung and potentially injure someone. The proper tang has to be designed and heat treated to prevent breaking, bending, or conducting hand numbing vibration from impacts to the user. Use Sword replicas are widely distributed and sold around the world, even in countries that try to restrict weapons. As such, even low-end ornamental swords can be used as weapons in assaults and robberies.

Winstedt, was an English Orientalist and colonial administrator with expertise in British Malaya. Winstedt was born in Oxford and educated at Magdalen College School and New College, Oxford, from which he received an MA. His brother was Eric Otto Winstedt, a Latinist and gypsiologist. In 1902 he became a cadet in the Federated Malay States Civil Service, and was posted to Perak where he studied Malay language and culture. In 1913 he was appointed District Officer in Kuala Pilah, and in 1916 appointed to the Education Department. In 1920 he received his DLitt degree from Oxford. He married Sarah Winstedt, a physician and surgeon with the Colonial Medical Service whom he had met in Kuala Pilah, in 1921. He served as the first President of Raffles College, Singapore, 1928‚Äì1931. During his presidency, he also served as acting Secretary to the High Commissioner, 1923, Director of Education for Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States (FMS), as a member of Legislative Council, Straits Settlements, 1924‚Äì1931 and as a member of the FMS Federal Council, 1927‚Äì1931. He was president of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1927, 1929 and 1931. After a term as General Adviser to Johore, 1931‚Äì1935, Winstedt retired from the Malayan Civil Service. He returned to England and was appointed Lecturer, then Reader, and ultimately Honorary Fellow, in Malay at the School of Oriental Studies in London, where he also served as a member of the Governing Body, 1939‚Äì1959. During World War II, he broadcast in Malay to Japanese-occupied Malaya. He retired from active teaching in 1946. Winstedt served on numerous boards and advisory groups, most notably at the Royal Asiatic Society in London, of which he was repeatedly the president and a Gold Medallist in 1947. Other organisations included the Association of British Malaya, of which he was president in 1938, the Colonial Office Advisory Committee on Education, 1936‚Äì1939, and the Royal India Society. He was a Fellow of the British Academy, an Honorary Member of the Southeast Asia Institute, the Royal Batavian Society, and the Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde. Accomplishments He was instrumental in preserving several works of Malay literature including The Malay Annals as well as producing important works regarding the Malays and their language such as A History of Malaya and A Dictionary of Malay Language. According to Australian Journal of Politics and History, \\"Winstedt was the first British scholar to make a systematic survey of Malay material for historical purposes, and laid the true foundation of a scientific approach to the writing of Malayan history.\\" He also played an important role in the Malayan and Singaporean education system. Specifically, he was interested in educating the Malays. Upon his suggestion, Sultan Idris Training College was established in 1922 with the purpose of producing Malay teachers. In 1997, the Malaysian government upgraded the institution into a university. In the 1926 Birthday Honours list, Winstedt was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George by the British sovereign to honour his contributions. He was made Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1935, and received an Honorary LLD (Malaya) in 1951. Winstedt's papers are archived at the School of Oriental and African Studies.

He was most recently the assistant manager of Aberdeen until leaving the club in March 2013. Knox worked with Alex Ferguson as an assistant manager at Aberdeen and Manchester United, and with Walter Smith at Rangers and Everton. Playing career As a player, Knox played in his native Scotland, featuring for Forfar Athletic (twice), St Mirren, Dundee United and a short spell with Montrose. During his time with Dundee United, Knox was a runner-up in the 1974 Scottish Cup final, his only honour as a player. Managerial career Knox's first managerial role came in a player-manager capacity when he returned to first club Forfar in 1976, spending four years in the dual role. In 1980, Knox became assistant to Alex Ferguson at Aberdeen, helping the team to two Scottish Cups, the European Cup Winners' Cup and subsequent European Super Cup in his three years with the Dons. In 1983, Knox returned to management with Dundee, where he would spend two-and-a-half years, with a best finish of sixth place in 1984‚Äì85 and 1985‚Äì86, narrowly missing out on UEFA Cup qualification. A short spell back at Aberdeen followed, before following Ferguson to Manchester United in 1986, where he stayed until April 1991. At this point, Knox came back to Scotland, becoming assistant to Walter Smith at Rangers, where the pair would enjoy six titles over the next seven years together. In July 1998, both men moved south to Everton, although their time was ended by March 2002. It was at this point that Knox's association with the national team began, with a three-year spell assisting then-manager Craig Brown. Short spells followed at Millwall and Coventry City (as assistant to Mark McGhee and Eric Black respectively) before returning to Scotland as Richard Gough's assistant at Livingston in November 2004. Knox again assisted the national team as a coach, helping at the Kirin Cup in May 2006. Knox was appointed Scotland under-21 manager in July 2006 following Rainer Bonhof's departure. In August 2007 he was appointed as Bolton's Assistant Manager by Wanderers manager Sammy Lee. When Lee left Knox was made caretaker manager for two games (against Arsenal and in the UEFA Cup against S.C. Braga) before Gary Megson took over. Knox remained at the club under Megson. Two days after Bolton Wanderers secured their premiership status he was axed by Megson with six other members of the coaching staff at the club. The club denied it was due to cost-cutting measures and stated it was due to Megson wanting to bring in his own staff. On 4 July 2008 Knox was appointed as the first-team coach of Blackburn Rovers by Paul Ince. They had previously worked together at Manchester United. He became the second member of the backroom staff to be appointed by Ince; his appointment followed that of Ray Mathias as assistant manager. On 18 December 2008, Knox was relieved of his duties along with Ray Mathias following the sacking of Paul Ince and the subsequent arrival of Sam Allardyce as the new Rovers manager. On 29 December 2009, he was appointed as the assistant manager to Craig Brown at Motherwell. On 10 December 2010, after Brown moved to Aberdeen, Knox followed him back to his former club. After three years with Brown, it announced that he and Brown would leave the club at the end of the season. Though leaving the club, Knox reversed his decision to retire, insisting he \\"not retiring now. I still feel young and I've plenty to offer.\\" In October 2013, Knox returned to Scottish Championship side Dundee as a playing scout role. Knox will be reunited with manager John Brown, whom he signed whilst manager at Dundee. In November 2017, he was one of four inductees into the Aberdeen Hall of Fame.

The Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina (), which was active between March 1996 and 31 December 2003, was a judicial body established in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the Annex 6 to the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Dayton Peace Agreement). Structure The Chamber had the mandate to consider alleged or apparent violations of human rights as provided in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Protocols thereto, and alleged or apparent discrimination arising in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms provided for in the Convention and 15 other international agreements listed in the Appendix to Annex 6 of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Particular priority was given to allegations of especially severe or systematic violations, as well as those founded on alleged discrimination on prohibited grounds. The applicants The Chamber was receiving applications concerning such human rights violations directly from any Party to Annex 6 of the Dayton Peace Agreement or from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation by any Party or acting on behalf of alleged victims who are deceased or missing. Jurisdiction of the Chamber The Chamber was only receiving applications concerning matters which are within the responsibility of one of the Parties to Annex 6 (the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Republika Srpska), and which occurred or continued after entry into force of the Dayton Peace Agreement on 14 December 1995. The judges of the Chamber The Chamber was composed of 14 judges. Four members were appointed by the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and two by the Republika Srpska. The remaining eight members were internationals appointed by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. The President of the Chamber, Ms. Mich√®le Picard, a French national, was designated by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe from among the international members. The members appointed are all distinguished lawyers and bring to the Chamber a wide variety of experience in different backgrounds including the judiciary, the academic sphere, private legal practice, administration and politics, and international, criminal and human rights law. The composition of the Human Rights Chamber was:HRC Web Site. #Prof. Dr. Rona Aybay (Turkish) #Dr. Hasan Baliƒá (Bosnian) #Mr. Mehmed Dekoviƒá (Bosnian) #Prof. Dr. Giovanni Grasso (Italian) #Mr. Andrew William Grotrian (British) #Mr. ≈Ωelimir Juka (Bosnian) #Prof.Dr. Viktor Masenko-Mavi (Hungarian) #Mr. Jakob M√∂ller (Icelandic) #Prof. Dr. Manfred Nowak (Austrian) #Mr. Miodrag Pajiƒá (Bosnian) #Ms. Mich√®le Picard (French) #Prof. Dr. Vitomir Popoviƒá (Bosnian) #Prof. Dr. Dietrich Rauschning (German) #Mr. Mato Tadiƒá (Bosnian) The admissibility criterion Under the terms of Annex 6 of the Dayton Peace Agreement, when the Chamber receives an application it must decide whether to accept or reject it, taking into account a number of criteria listed in Article VIII. These criteria include: (a) whether effective remedies exist, and the applicant has demonstrated that they have been exhausted and that the application has been filed with the Chamber within six months from such date on which the final decision was taken; (b) whether the application is substantially the same as a matter that the Chamber has already examined; (c) whether the application is incompatible with the Human Rights Agreement, manifestly ill-founded, or an abuse of the right of petition; and (d) whether the application concerns a matter currently pending before another international human rights body or another Commission established by the Dayton Peace Agreement. The procedure of the Chamber The Chamber‚Äôs procedures was modeled on those of the European Court of Human Rights. Unless the Chamber decides at the outset that an application is inadmissible or should be struck out, written observations are requested from the applicant and respondent Party, after which the Chamber deliberates and decides on a case. In addition to the written procedure, the Chamber may decide to schedule a public hearing for oral argument by the parties and submission of evidence by witnesses and experts. The Chamber may also invite written or oral amicus curiae submissions. If the Chamber finds a violation, it may, in its written decision on the merits, issue an order indicating the steps that the respondent Party must take to remedy the breach, including orders to cease and desist or grant monetary relief. At any stage of the proceedings, it may also order provisional measures or attempt to facilitate an amicable resolution based on respect for human rights. The implementation of the decisions The decisions of the Chamber were final and binding and the respondent Parties are obligated to implement them fully. Chamber decisions on the merits are forwarded to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Office of the High Representative (OHR) for monitoring of compliance. The expiration of the mandate of the Chamber According to the Agreement Pursuant to Article XIV of Annex 6 to the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina entered into by the Parties on 22 and 25 September 2003, the Human Rights Chamber's mandate expired on 31 December 2003. This Agreement established the Human Rights Commission to operate between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 within the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Human Rights Commission has jurisdiction to consider pending cases received by the Human Rights Chamber on or before 31 December 2003; after 1 January 2004, new cases alleging human rights violations are to be decided by the Constitutional Court.

An executioner's sword is a sword designed specifically for decapitation of condemned criminals (as opposed to combat). These swords were intended for two-handed use, but were lacking a point, so that their overall blade length was typically that of a single- handed sword (ca. ). The quillons were quite short, and mainly straight, and the pommel was often pear-shaped or faceted. In the Middle Ages, decapitations were executed with regular swords, and the earliest known specifically designed executioner's sword dates to ca. 1540. They were in wide use in 17th- century Europe, but fell out of use quite suddenly in the early 18th century. The last executions by sword in Europe were carried out in Switzerland in 1867 and 1868, when Niklaus Emmenegger in Lucerne and H√©li Freymond in Moudon were beheaded for murder. A swords known as a sulthan are used to carry out executions in Saudi Arabia (see Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia). The blades of executioner's swords were often decorated with symbolic designs.

Biography Born at Ufa, he graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of St Petersburg in 1907 and then briefly studied at Heidelberg University before taking up archaeology back at St Petersburg, graduating in 1910. He headed the archives of Institute of Archaeology until 1923 focussing on cataloguing the Elamite antiquities there. Between 1925 and 1933 he led a number or archaeological expeditions to the Northern Pontic region and Transcaucasia. He became a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as a historian, in 1932 and was director of the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography from 1934 to 1937. Institute of Language and Thought Meshchaninov was a follower of Nikolay Yakovlevich Marr and succeeded him as head of the Soviet Institute of Language and Thought from 1935 to 1950. He advocated that material culture goes through developmental stages and that migratory changes were secondary in this process. He published A New Theory in Languages, a guide to Marrism, and later Verb and Parts of Speech and Phrase Elements. As a linguist, however, Meshchaninov did not adhere straightforwardly to the radical Marrism, but rather tended to reconcile its ideas with a more objective historical linguistics and typology. He advocated the idea of notional categories that is also found in Otto Jespersen's works, studied polysynthetic languages and syntax. Then in 1948 a move against the Anti-Marrists was initiated, in which however it was not Meschaninov himself who played a major role, but rather younger Marrists as Fedot Filin, depicting such people as Viktor Vinogradov and Aleksandr Reformatskii as \\"bourgeois idealists\\". While the last Marrist campaign was successful in Leningrad, he met resistance amongst linguists in Moscow, and also from the Caucausian linguists. Among linguists who resisted Marrism were Boris Serebrennikov, Arnold Chikobava, Rachia Acharyan, and Grikor Kapantsyan. In 1950 he was denounced by Joseph Stalin: \\"The Arakcheyev regime was set up by the 'disciples' of N. Y. Marr.\\" This term, derived from the tsarist military officer Aleksey Arakcheyev (1768‚Äì1834), means a regime having \\"... a policy of extreme reaction, police despotism and crude militarism\\".Great Soviet Encyclopaedia, Volume 2; 1973; p. 229. However Stalin stated that he \\"did not question the honesty of Comrade Meschaninov and others\\", which resulted in that Meschaninov lost his position at the Institute of Language and Thought but continued carrying out research and held all his titles, medals and honours. Following Stalin's death he became active in linguistics again and re-edited his major works. He died in Leningrad in 1967.

The Rural Enterprise Community Grant was awarded by the USDA to communities throughout the United States that had high rates of poverty and whose residents put together comprehensive strategic plans for job creation and community improvement. As of January 2008 the Molokai Enterprise Community had received slightly more than $25 million. Structure Ke Aupuni Lokahi had a small administrative staff and an 11-member Board of Directors which voted on both current and new project and initiative changes. According to USDA EZ/EC guidelines, no less than 55% of Enterprise Community Boards could be composed of members elected by each communities' residents, while the other 45% were appointed by other board members. Each board member served two year terms before having to be re- elected by the community, or re-appointed by the rest of the board. Projects The Molokai Community started out with a total of 40 projects for Ke Aupuni Lokahi to work on and to provide funding to. There had been some undeniable successes realized by the Enterprise Community Grant on Molokai, including the outfitting of 300 applicants' homes with solar energy systems, to offset the extraordinarily high residential energy costs faced by Molokai's homeowners. Ke Aupuni Lokahi had also been instrumental in purchasing farm machinery for Molokai's Hoolehua Homestead Association to cut down on the costs faced by Molokai's taro farmers, many of whom are engaged in subsistence farming practices. In its 2008 Annual Report Executive Summary the Molokai Enterprise Community noted that it moved forward with 25 projects outlined over its 10-year history and highlighted five projects: Molokai Community Health Center (MCHC), the incorporation of the Molokai Affordable Homes & Community Development Corporation (MAHCDC), the implementation of the Hawaii Tourism Authority for services related to the enhancement to the Ala Pala‚Äôu trails project, the Molokai Land Trust to support conservation and open space preservation, and the 90% restoration efforts of the historic Kalanianaole Hall. Master Land-Use Plan Ke Aupuni Lokahi's most controversial project was its support of the Community-Based Master Land Use Plan, which was created in conjunction with Molokai's largest landowner Molokai Properties Limited (known as Molokai Ranch to locals). Molokai Ranch would donate of land back to the Molokai community in the form of a land trust. In exchange, Laau Point, a remote area of southwestern Molokai, would be re-zoned for residential land use, from its current designation as agricultural land, so that Molokai Ranch could construct 200 luxury homes in the area. The support given by the Ke Aupuni Lokahi board divided the Molokai community, and there were several protests held at board meetings, at Laau Point, and at the Office of Hawaiian Affairs headquarters in Honolulu. Among the communities concerns were what will happen to the small island's social demographics if Molokai becomes a haven for the wealthy, and whether the island had enough potable water in its various wells to transport the needed amounts from the wetter east end to the more arid west. Community members successfully opposed Molokai Ranch's attempt to expand through the \\"Save La'au Point\\" movement and as a result, on March 24, 2008 what was then the island's largest employer decided to shut down all operations including hotels, a movie theater, restaurants, and a golf course and dismissed 120 workers.

The film premiered during the Directors' Fortnight at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. The drama film stars Thai actress Lalita Panyopas in a story of a middle-aged married couple who question their relationship after seven years. Ananda Everingham is featured in a supporting role as a bartender. The film contained sex scenes that were shown at Cannes, but due to censorship concerns had to be re-edited by the director so the film could be shown in cinemas in Thailand when it opened there on June 7, 2007. (Bangkok Post articles are archived after seven days for subscribers only) The uncensored version of the film was shown in Thailand at the 2007 Bangkok International Film Festival. Plot The death of a relative brings a Thai-American couple, Wit and Dang, back to Bangkok for the first time in many years. Arriving at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport at around 5 a.m., they check into a hotel in the city. Suffering from jet lag, Dang wants to sleep, but her husband Wit is restless and heads down to the hotel bar to buy some cigarettes. While unpacking their luggage, Dang finds a small paper with a phone number of a woman named Noy, and she is immediately suspicious. In the hotel bar, Wit meets Ploy, a young woman who says she is waiting for her mother to arrive from Stockholm. The two bond over coffee and cigarettes, and Wit then invites Ploy to come up to the hotel room, where she can take a shower and rest while she awaits her mother. Up at the room, Dang opens the door and sees Ploy. To the girl, Dang is pleasant and friendly, but to her husband, she is seething with anger and jealousy. She has bouts of suspicion, followed by hallucinations / nightmares. Fitfully, the three people try to sleep. Dang and Wit discuss their seven-year marriage, and wonder why the love has gone out of it. Meanwhile, a hotel maid, Tum, has stolen a guest's suit from the hotel's dry cleaners. She takes it up to room 609 and hangs it in the closet. Nut, the silent, weary bartender, enters the room and puts on the suit. He then finds Tum hiding in the shower, and proceeds to kiss her and caress her, and the couple starts having a sexual relationship. Back in Wit and Dang's room, Dang becomes more upset, and decides to leave. Wit wakes up to find Dang gone, and then he and Ploy sit and smoke cigarettes and talk about love and relationships. They discuss how married life begins to lose its sheen eventually and think of options to keep the flame lit. At one point, Ploy mentions that she had a dream about the entire episode of the hotel maid and the bartender, which makes the viewer realize it was only a dream. Ploy eventually leaves the hotel room, when Wit falls asleep. Out of curiosity, she examines the room in which she drempt that the maid and the bartender had sex. Dang finds a coffee shop, where she takes a seat with a cup of coffee and pours some vodka in it from a small bottle she took from her hotel room's mini-bar. She is noticed by Moo, who is using his laptop computer. He recognizes Dang from her days as a famous television soap opera actress and invites her back to his home for some more drinks. Dang, who has already had quite a bit to drink, eventually throws up. Moo, spikes her last drink and tries to get closer to her. When Dang turns down his advances, he attacks and rapes her, although she puts up a fight. When Dang's life is in danger, they end up playing a game of hide and seek that would end with one of them dead. Given the previous storyline that turned out to be a dream, the viewer is left with uncertainty about what is a dream, and what is reality. The movie shifts to a scene with Wit and Dang at the funeral, and viewers are left to adjust their view as they surmise that Wit had only dreamed this hostile plot line. The film ends with Wit and Dang leaving Thailand, as Dang says nothing about her ugly encounter with the rapist, Moo; when Wit sees her back at the hotel, he is happy to have Dang back with him. He places his hand over Dang's in the taxi, and sincerely tells her he loves her, which she had earlier expressed longing to hear. Dang smiles, and rests her head on Wit's shoulder lovingly as they exit Thailand to return to their home in the United States.

Production=Origins Director Pen-Ek Ratanaruang at the press preview of Ploy in June 2007 in Bangkok Director Pen-Ek Ratanaruang said he was inspired to write the screenplay after talking with a relative who had returned to Bangkok after some years in the United States. \\"My cousin had a restaurant in the U.S. and one day she came back to Thailand for a funeral,\\" Pen-Ek said. \\"But she didn't have a home here, so she had to stay in a hotel. I met her at the funeral and it struck me as rather odd that this Thai person had to stay in a hotel room when she came to Thailand. It inspired me to start writing a script about a Thai couple in a hotel room.\\" The film's proposal was submitted in 2006 to the Pusan Promotion Plan at the Pusan International Film Festival. Budgeted at around US$2 million, principal photography began in February 2007 in Bangkok. The locations included hotels and restaurants along Sukhumvit Road, as well as Suvarnabhumi Airport, making Ploy the first Thai feature film to feature Bangkok's new international airport. \\"Most of the action takes place in a hotel room. So we built our own room on the rooftop of a hotel, and it looks exactly like a real hotel room,\\" Pen-Ek said in the film's production notes. In March 2007, the Hong Kong/Amsterdam-based film financing and distribution company, Fortissimo Films, announced it would be executive producer of the film along with Thailand's Five Star Production. Fortissimo takes care of international sales for the film, while Five Star handles distribution in Thailand. From the start, producers sought to make Ploy a smaller-scale film than Pen-Ek's previous two films, Last Life in the Universe and Invisible Waves, which \\"were high-budget productions with international collaboration,\\" said executive producer Chareon Iamphungporn. The previous two films had also been scripted or co-scripted by Thai writer Prabda Yoon. Chareon said he wanted Pen-Ek to return to his screenwriter-director roots and \\"come up with a project that had the personal warmth of his early films like 6ixtynin9 and Monrak Transistor.\\" The film reunited Pen-Ek with Thai cinematographer Chankit Chamnivikaipong, who had photographed his first three films, Fun Bar Karaoke, 6ixtynin9 and Monrak Transistor, before Pen-Ek collaborated with Christopher Doyle on Last Life in the Universe and Invisible Waves. Casting From left, Lalita Panyopas, Apinya Sakuljaroensuk and Pornwut Sarasin talk to the press at the Thai press preview in June 2007 in Bangkok. The supporting cast, starting second from left, Thaksakorn Pradabpongsa, Ananda Everingham, Apinya Sakuljaroensuk and Porntip Papanai, at a photo session during the press preview of Ploy in June 2007 in Bangkok Ploy was a reunion for Pen-Ek and actress Lalita Panyopas, who is well known in Thailand for her roles in soap operas and a string of films in the 1980s. She starred in Pen-Ek's 1999 crime comedy-drama 6ixtynin9. Pornwut Sarasin, who portrays the husband Wit, was a first-time actor. Forty-eight years old at the time of shooting, he is a vice president for Thai Namthip, the distributor of Coca-Cola in Thailand, and is well known in Thai high-society circles. Ananda Everingham, who plays Nut the bartender, had worked with Pen-ek on a short film Twelve Twenty, commissioned for the 2006 Jeonju International Film Festival. He shares erotic scenes with model-actress Porntip Papanai, who plays the maid, Tum. She had a major role in Pen-ek's 2001 musical-comedy, Monrak Transistor, portraying the singer, Dao. For the title character, Ploy, Pen-Ek chose Apinya Sakulcharoensuk, who was 16 years old at the time of shooting. \\"She's a godsend,\\" the director said of the actress. \\"It's as if I could sense that the Ploy character is out there somewhere in the real world, and then she materializes in the form of this girl. Apinya was born to be Ploy.\\" Apinya had her hair styled into an Afro, a decision made by costume designer Visa Khongka, to make the character of Ploy look older and unique. Reception The film premiered on May 21, 2007 during the Directors' Fortnight at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. (Bangkok Post articles are archived after seven days for subscribers only) Critical reaction was mixed. Russell Edwards, writing for the film industry trade publication Variety, was negative, criticizing the film for its \\"glacial pace\\" and saying it was \\"too flimsy and false to truly engage.\\" Lee Marshall, writing for another trade journal, Screen Daily, was positive, mentioning The Seven Year Itch and calling Ploy \\"a tasty slice of cinema, by turns oneiric, erotic, funny and emotionally perceptive.\\" \\"Ploy imposes its own unhurried rhythm but then rewards its viewers for their indulgence, and within the arthouse niche that it will inevitably inhabit this could turn out to be a strong seller,\\" Marshall wrote. In an interview at Cannes, Pen-Ek reacted to the Variety and Screen Daily reviews, saying, \\"One is so bad and one is so good. They're equally not true.\\" Todd Brown, writing from Cannes for the website Twitchfilm.net, said Ploy is a logical step in the director's evolution, continuing on themes that were explored in Last Life in the Universe and Invisible Waves. \\"Ploy is essentially a lucid dream, a film that takes place in that odd in-between state when you cannot be sure whether you are sleeping or awake and there are seemingly sure pointers that would have you believe both. It is a film about people dislocated and relationships formed while others are breaking down badly,\\" Brown wrote. \\"Ploy is a beautiful, thoughtful, meditative film, one that requires more effort from its audience than does Last Life in the Universe but one that the patient will find no less rewarding.\\" Kong Rithdee, critic for the Bangkok Post, said \\"Ploy is a finely tuned, mature piece of filmmaking that discusses adult themes with honesty and amused attention to the tiny details that define the shifting phases of a marriage. Ploy takes us closer to the characters than the director did in his last two outings ... and despite its dreamy episodes of hot-breath lovemaking, the movie is anchored in the sense of social realities more than his non-fans might care to observe.\\" Censorship issues The version of Ploy that was shown at Cannes featured some extended scenes of nudity and sex between the bartender (Ananda Everingham) and the maid (Porntip Papanai). This is uncommon for Thai films because the industry is subjected to a censorship code that prohibits such depictions. Pen-Ek said he didn't like directing the sex scenes. \\"It's not fun at all. I don't know how to direct two people making love! And it's not a good experience when they had to do it over and over again for 12 hours.\\" In describing the scenes in his review, Russell Edwards of Variety called them \\"compellingly erotic\\", but sarcastically added that the scenes \\"indicate that cinema's gain has truly been pornography's loss.\\" Todd Brown of Twitchfilm.net said the sex scenes might harm the film's chances in Thailand, saying \\"Thailand is notorious for the uneven application of its censorship laws but graphic nudity is pretty much always frowned upon.\\" Ahead of the film's opening in Thailand, the country's Board of Censorship ordered eight cuts for scenes it deemed obscene and inappropriate, mostly the lovemaking scenes. The director re-edited the film, cutting some scenes and adding others not included in the Cannes version, so the length is unchanged. The version shown in Cannes is unlikely to be seen in Thailand. \\"Once again a good movie has been butchered by the powers-that-be, who believe their judgment is superior to ours,\\" Bangkok Post film critic Kong Rithdee said in his review, referring to another film that had run afoul of Thai censors earlier in the year, Syndromes and a Century, by Apichatpong Weerasethakul. That film was pulled from release by the director, who refused to make the cuts ordered. For Ploy, the cuts have little effect on the film as whole, Rithdee said, though the contrast is less stark between the bartender's and maid's steamy sex scenes and the chilly arguments of the married couple. The uncensored version of the film was screened in the main competition at the 2007 Bangkok International Film Festival. Box office Ploy was released in Thailand cinemas on June 7, 2007, but proved to be no match for the Thai comedy film, Nhong Teng kon maha hia, which was released the previous weekend and even topped a Hollywood release, Ocean's Thirteen. In its opening weekend, Ploy earned six million baht (about US$171,000) in Bangkok cinemas, compared to the $2.28 million after two weeks of earnings by Nhong Teng kon maha hia. Five Star Production had hoped the film would do better, based on the popularity of leading actress Lalita Panyopas, positive reviews from Cannes and word-of-mouth buzz. \\"We expected a little more with Ploy,\\" Co-producer Aphiradee Iamphungphorn was quoted as saying by Variety. \\"It is difficult to predict the market these days. Some people may have second thoughts whether they should see the film with the name Pen-Ek Ratanaruang as a director. Many still have this image that he only makes difficult movies.\\" Festivals and awards International film festival of kerala - world cinema section *2007 Cannes Film Festival, Directors' Fortnight, world premiere *2007 Bangkok International Film Festival, Golden Kinneree nominee for best international film *2007 Osian's Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema, FIPRESCI award winner *2007 Toronto International Film Festival *2007 San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival * 2008 Deauville Asian Film Festival * 2008 Silk Screen Asian American Film Festival ReferencesExternal links Synopsis at Fortissimo Films *Ploy trailer download at Five Star Production *Ploy music video download at Five Star Production Category:2007 films Category:Five Star Production films Category:Thai films Category:Thai-language films Category:2007 romantic drama films Category:Films directed by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang Category:2007 drama films Category:Thai romantic drama films ","title":"Ploy"},{"id":"10158742","text":"Screenshot of TV3 Latvia in 2009 TV3 Latvia is a television channel targeted at a Latvian language audience owned by All Media Baltics, a company owned by investment firm Providence Equity Partners.

The film is notable for some rarely seen aerial photography of combat aircraft active with the IAF in the 1980s. The central character of Angad is a MiG-21 pilot and is shown flying the aircraft in the ground attack role in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Much of the movie, including the climax involving a MiG-21bis, was shot at Pune. The IAF No.4 Squadron (the 'Oorials') provided the pilots and planes for the film's aerial sequences. The movie included good color footage of the Oorials aircraft in flight and in operation.

The society was founded in 1778 by naturalist Jacob Cornelis Matthieu Radermacher as the Bataviaasch Genootschap der Kunsten en Wetenschappen (Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences), and assumed its current name in 1910. After Indonesian independence in 1949, it was renamed the Lembaga Kebudajaan Indonesia in 1950, and in 1962 ceased operation. Its collection is now in the Museum Nasional. History In early 18th century, an intellectual movement popularly known as the Age of Enlightenment swept across Europe. This movement lean towards scientific approach in quests for knowledge and answers of natural phenomena. In the Netherlands, this group of ideology had encouraged the establishment of an association called Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen (HMW) in Haarlem in 1752. This association apparently brought a new way of thinking to the officials of Dutch colonies. By that time, parts of the Indonesian archipelago was held under the Dutch East India Company (VOC), which obviously mainly interested on the economic pursuit. However, there was a young figure among VOC official ‚Äî J.C.M Radermacher ‚Äî who was interested in arts and sciences endeavour in the Indies. Radermacher suggested the establishment of an association in Batavia similar to those in Haarlem. Initially this suggestion was not received well, until 1777 when during the commemoration of 25 years of HMW there was an intention to open the branch in the colony. Radermacher's wish was realized, and the association was not only as a branch, but as an independent scientific association established in Batavia. On 24 April 1778, an association was established in Batavia named Bataviaasch Genootschap der Kunsten en Wetenschappen (Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences), often abbreviated as BG. Governor General and high official of VOC were designated as members of board of directors and society key figures were to become members of the association. The motto of Bataviaasch Genootschap (BG) was Ten Nutte van Het Gemeen (For Public's Best Interest). The main objective of BG is to analyze the cultural and scientific aspects of the East Indies, including its society and natural environment, through facilitating research conducted by experts. Subjects At first, the scope of activity of BG was quite general; among others were natural science, ethnography, history, manuscript and literature, agriculture and medication. The role of the institution as colonial government's consultant has grew more prominent; especially in the field of archaeology and the preservation of ancient sites in Java ‚Äî prior to the establishment of Archaeological service in 1913. Since mid-19th century however, the scope was narrowed down to exclude natural science subjects that was took over by a more specific Physics Association. BG would concentrate only in the subjects of language and literature, archaeology and history, as well as ethnography and anthropology. Journals and publications The association was quite productive, published scientific articles and journals; Verhandelingen van het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen (VBG, published in 1779 to 1950) and Tijdschrift voor Indische taal-land en volkenkunde (TBG, published in 1853 to 1952). The association administrative reports is published in Notulen van Bataviaasch Genootschap (NBG). Museum collections The Hindu-Buddhist statue collection of Batavian Society, circa 1896. Since its establishment, the Batavian Society had started gathering the collection acquired from the contributions of its members. The initial collection was much owed to its founder, J.C.M. Radermacher that contributed his house at De Groote Rivier street along with his collection of books, manuscripts, musical instruments, currency, flora samples of dried plants, etc. At that time, collecting and donating curious rare and unique objects is regarded as a commendable endeavour, intellectually fashionable and prestigious activity among the social elites in Batavia. Therefore, the society's collection increased significantly. Since 1779, the society decided to exhibit its collection for public, although restricted only in Wednesday from 8 to 10 o'clock. This was the seed of the museum activity. The member of BG were allowed to borrow the SBG's book collection with time limit up to 3 weeks. During the British rule, Stamford Raffles donated an additional building located behind the Societeit de Harmonie hall to store the large sum of collections that insufficiently stored in De Groote Rivier building. Meanwhile, the collection grow significantly greater due to the addition of zoology collection in the form of preserved mammals, birds, seashells, etc. In 1822, Governor General G.A. Baron van der Capellen issued a decree to form a commission to search for important objects in Java and sent them to the Batavian Society. The policy to increase the museum collection was pushed further by the Governor General J.C. Baud's (1833-1836) decree that instructed the government officials throughout Dutch East Indies to assist in searching for important objects for Batavian Society museum collection. The surge of collection was not always beneficial to the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, since it meant an increase in maintenance cost and storage space. To reduce its collections, therefore, in 1843 part of the zoology collection was sent out to the Ethnology Museum in Leiden, while the rest was auctioned. In 1850, the geological and mineralogy collection was sent to the newly established Physics Association. In 1855, a law regarding Treasure Discovery was enacted; stipulating that all archaeological findings in the Indies had to be reported to the government, and the Batavian Society museum might buy it in the price according to the an appropriate appraisal. By mid-19th century, the Batavian Society museum building in Harmoni was also considered insufficient to store and exhibit the growing collection. Although the plan to build a new museum has been conceived since 1836, it was not until 1862 the new museum finally came into reality. With the patronage of King Willem III, the colonial government built a new building on the present location of National Museum at Jalan Merdeka Barat 12. The original building was built in Greek Neoclassical architecture, and originally it has no second floor. The museum acquired its collection through many ways, among others were through scientific expeditions, archaeological sites, acquisition of private collections, gifts from distinguished patrons, objects donated by religious missions; such as ethnological artifacts acquired by Christian Zending and Catholic Missions, and also treasures acquired ‚Äî or looted to be exact ‚Äî from a number of military expeditions led by Dutch East Indies military throughout the archipelago against indigenous kingdoms and polities. Treasures, among others from Aceh, Lombok and Bali acquired through the military expeditions led by the Dutch colonial government, also made it to the collection of Batavian Society and Leiden Museum. Other institutions established by the society The Zoological Museum of Bogor, established in 1894 by the Batavia of Art and Science. The society made the plans for the Hortus Botanicus Bogoriense in Bogor in 1817. The Zoological Museum of Bogor (Museum Zoologicum Bogorinse) was established by the Batavia Society of Art and Science in Bogor, Indonesia in 1894. The Bibliotheca Bogoriense (Bogor Library) made Bogor into an important center of biological science.Cultural Policy in Indonesia (PDF). Paris: UNESCO. 1973. pp. 29‚Äì33.

It examines the experiences of some Mormon missionaries who questioned their religious beliefs after serving their missions. It premiered in December 2003 and was 60 minutes long. Some Mormon missionaries, including those serving missions in a foreign culture, may begin to question their religious upbringing and belief system. Get the Fire follows three LDS missionaries during their two-year missions in Germany. The documentary opens with the three future missionaries at their respective homes prior to knowing where they will serve. Surrounded by their family, each boy opens a mission call informing them they will serve in the Munich, Germany mission. The documentary follows them along the full two years of their mission from the Missionary Training Center until they leave the mission and return home. The film shows missionaries proselyting in public squares, knocking door to door, struggling with a foreign language, congregating in zone and district meetings, and meeting with the mission president. Topics covered include missionary slang, leaving a girlfriend at home, missionary morale, and relationships with family at home. The three missionaries appear to remain dedicated and faithful to their mission in the film. The documentary juxtaposes the sanguine views of the missionaries in Germany with interviews of former missionaries who have left the church. These interviews present a look at the experience of both young American and foreign-born Mormon missionaries and explore issues they have with the church. As these changed Mormon missionaries struggle to reconcile their intense, religious experience with a new outlook on life, they realize their perceptions about black and white, dogmatic thinking have changed.

Early life Boddy was born into an ecclesiastical family: his father was a vicar, and his mother was a descendant of Mary Vazeille, who had been married to John Wesley. Although he trained to be a solicitor, a religious experience at the Keswick Convention convinced him he should become ordained into the Church of England. Following several appointments, the Bishop of Durham, J. B. Lightfoot, placed him in All Saints Church in Monkwearmouth, Sunderland in 1884. In 1891 he married Mary Pollock. Boddy was inspired by the Holiness Movement, and he had an intense religious experience in 1892. In 1899 his wife Mary experienced a healing from asthma and they both believed that she had a gift for healing through the laying-on of hands. In 1904 he visited Wales during the Welsh Revival and met Evan Roberts, and in 1907 he travelled to Oslo, where T. B. Barratt was leading a religious revival modelled on the events of the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles. Barratt was invited to Boddy's church, and subsequently Boddy and his wife began to experience glossolalia. Boddy in Pentecostal history All Saints in Monkwearmouth became a centre for British Pentecostalism, and on Tuesday 28 October 1907, Mary Boddy laid hands on the evangelist Smith Wigglesworth. From 1908 to 1914 Boddy hosted a series of Sunderland Whitsuntide Conventions, which gained national press attention. Boddy also helped to found the Pentecostal Missionary Union, with Cecil Polhill, and he was a member of the Pentecostal International Advisory Council (IAC). As a Church of England minister, he tried to discourage the creation of separate denominations. Teachings Boddy taught that the purpose of the Holy Spirit was to emphasise Christ, and that divine love was more important than speaking in tongues. He continued to have a high view of the sacraments, and defended the practice of infant baptism. He warned against exaggeration as regards healing testimonies. He also believed that the Second Coming of Christ was imminent, and he suggested that certain events during World War I were portents of Biblical prophecy. After visiting the USA, he was disturbed by an emphasis among Pentecostal churches there on money. Unlike some other Pentecostals, he supported the British war effort. Publications Prior to his Pentecostal experience Boddy composed a number of Roker Tracts on Holiness subjects. He also wrote several travel books on Russia, Canada, Palestine, and Egypt. From 1908-1926 he was the editor of and chief contributor to Confidence magazine.

The second definition differs from the first in that it requires all minimal elements to have the same rank; for posets with a least element, however, the two requirements are equivalent.

History Engineering is the profession aimed at modifying the natural environment, through the design, manufacture and maintenance of artifacts and technological systems. It might then be contrasted with science, the aim of which is to understand nature. Engineering at its core is about causing change, and therefore management of change is central to engineering practice. The philosophy of engineering is then the consideration of philosophical issues as they apply to engineering. Such issues might include the objectivity of experiments, the ethics of engineering activity in the workplace and in society, the aesthetics of engineered artifacts, etc. While engineering seems historically to have meant devising, the distinction between art, craft and technology isn't clearcut. The Latin root ars, the Germanic root kraft and the Greek root techne all originally meant the skill or ability to produce something, as opposed to, say, athletic ability. The something might be tangible, like a sculpture or a building, or less tangible, like a work of literature. Nowadays, art is commonly applied to the visual, performing or literary fields, especially the so-called fine arts ('the art of writing'), craft usually applies to the manual skill involved in the manufacture of an object, whether embroidery or aircraft ('the craft of typesetting') and technology tends to mean the products and processes currently used in an industry ('the technology of printing'). In contrast, engineering is the activity of effecting change through the design and manufacture of artifacts ('the engineering of print technology'). Ethics What distinguishes engineering design from artistic design is the requirement for the engineer to make quantitative predictions of the behavior and effect of the artifact prior to its manufacture. Such predictions may be more or less accurate but usually includes the effects on individuals and/or society. In this sense, engineering can be considered a social as well a technological discipline and judged not just by whether its artifacts work, in a narrow sense, but also by how they influence and serve social values. What engineers do is subject to moral evaluation.2nd Philosophy of Engineering Seminar Information Modeling Socio-technical systems, such as transport, utilities and their related infrastructures comprise human elements as well as artifacts. Traditional mathematical and physical modeling techniques may not take adequate account of the effects of engineering on people, and culture.Engineering Models Retrieved May 2018 The Civil Engineering discipline makes elaborate attempts to ensure that a structure meets its specifications and other requirements prior to its actual construction. The methods employed are well known as Analysis and Design. Systems Modelling and Description makes an effort to extract the generic unstated principles behind the engineering approach. Product life cycle The traditional engineering disciplines seem discrete but the engineering of artifacts has implications that extend beyond such disciplines into areas that might include psychology, finance and sociology. The design of any artifact will then take account of the conditions under which it will be manufactured, the conditions under which it will be used, and the conditions under which it will be disposed. Engineers can consider such \\"life cycle\\" issues without losing the precision and rigor necessary to design functional systems.

He played in MLB for the Colorado Rockies, Boston Red Sox, Kansas City Royals, and Toronto Blue Jays. Professional career=Colorado Rockies A power-throwing left-hander, Morales made his Major League debut on August 18, 2007, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He pitched 5 innings, gave up one run, but got a no-decision. In 2007, Morales was selected to the All-Star Futures Game at AT&T; Park in San Francisco. Morales made 8 starts in 2007 going 3-2 with a 3.43 ERA. He was also part of the Rockies' 25-man active roster for the postseason where the team went to the World Series for the first time ever but lost to the Red Sox in a 4-game sweep. On April 29, 2008, Morales was optioned to the Colorado Rockies Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox in response to a sub-par performance during the early 2008 Major League season. During the 2008 season, he made 5 starts going 1-2 with a 6.39 ERA in the Majors. In spring training in 2009, Morales led all pitchers in pickoffs, with 5, in 28 innings.. He began the regular season in the starting rotation, but after struggling early he was optioned to the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox. He was called back up and has been pitching from the bullpen since July 7. In 2009, Morales made 40 appearances (2 starts) going 3-2 with a 4.50 ERA. In 2010, Morales made 35 relief appearances going 0-4 with a 6.28 ERA. Morales started the 2011 season with 14 relief appearances going 0-1 with a 3.86 ERA. Boston Red Sox Boston Red Sox in 2011 On May 19, 2011, Morales was acquired by the Boston Red Sox for a player to be named later or cash considerations. On May 22, he made his debut appearance for the Red Sox in a game against the Chicago Cubs. Morales finished the 2011 season with Boston making 36 relief appearances going 1-1 with a 3.62 ERA. Overall in 2011 combined with two teams, Morales made a total of 50 appearances going 1-2 with a 3.69 ERA. Near the end of the 2012 season, Morales was injured. He was diagnosed with a shoulder injury. He had a starting job before September and stuck with it until his injury. On January 16, 2012, Morales signed a one-year deal worth $850K with the Red Sox, avoiding arbitration. During the 2012 season, Morales made 37 appearances (9 starts) going 3-4 with a 3.77 ERA. In the off-season he trained to be a starter for 2013. In 2013, Morales made 20 appearances (1 start) going 2-2 with a 4.62 ERA. Morales made 3 appearances in the postseason. In his final appearance in a Red Sox uniform, he relieved Clay Buchholz in Game 6 of the ALCS. With the Red Sox ahead 1-0 in the 6th inning and two inherited runners on base, Morales walked Prince Fielder on 4 pitches, then fell behind Victor Martinez before yielding a 2-run Wall Ball single. Morales was replaced by Brandon Workman who ended the inning without further damage. The Sox won the game when Shane Victorino hit a 7th inning grand slam. Morales did not pitch in the World Series as the Red Sox won the championship over the St. Louis Cardinals. He was traded by the Red Sox before the end of the year. Second stint with Rockies On December 18, 2013, Morales was traded back to the Colorado Rockies along with minor league pitcher Chris Martin for utility man Jonathan Herrera. After being primarily a relief pitcher for the Red Sox in his previous three years, Morales found his way back into a starting role to begin the 2014 season with the Rockies; he made his season debut on April 3 as the team's fourth starter, giving up 3 earned runs and 8 hits in innings in a no decision against the Miami Marlins. Kansas City Royals Morales signed a minor league deal with the Kansas City Royals on February 19, 2015 and made the team out of spring training. He got his first win with the team on April 19, throwing the final two pitches of an at bat to Brett Lawrie after Kelvin Herrera was ejected for throwing at Lawrie. Morales finished the 2015 season with a 3.18 ERA and a 4-2 record in 67 relief appearances. With the Royals finishing the season 95-67, the team clinched the AL Central and eventually won the 2015 World Series against the New York Mets, their first championship in 30 years. It was the second championship Morales won in his career. Milwaukee Brewers On March 4, 2016, Morales signed a minor league deal with the Milwaukee Brewers with an invitation to spring training. He was released on March 28. Toronto Blue Jays On April 2, 2016, Morales signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. After making two appearances for the Blue Jays, Morales was placed on the 15-day disabled list with shoulder fatigue. He was later transferred to the 60-day disabled list. Morales began a rehab assignment in June, and on July 22, was activated by the Blue Jays. On August 1, Morales was designated for assignment. He was released by the Blue Jays on August 9. Acereros de Monclova On June 22, 2017, Morales signed with the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican Baseball League. He became a free agent after the 2017 season.

It was settled by German colonists in 1852. Puerto Octay was an important port with regular traffic to Puerto Varas before the coming of railway in 1912. History Its origin dates back to the German colonization in 1852 driven by Bernhard Philippi. Years later it became one of the major ports on Lake Llanquihue. On 22 December 1891 the municipality was established, under the Presidency of the Republic Jorge Montt. Puerto Octay, Un Recodo Alem√°n German heritage history typical German architecture in Puerto Octay. Puerto Octay currently has a rich and varied architecture, mostly built of wood, which is the historical reflection of the colonization process, driven by the State of Chile in the mid-nineteenth century, with families coming from Germany. So constructions emerge as the House Niklitschek, Hotel Haase, Wulf House, current Colegio San Vicente de Paul and House Werner to name a few. What is extraordinary about this city is that despite the lapse of more than 100 years, it is still possible to assess this type of buildings. As a way to cherish and protect this architectural heritage, now taking place in Puerto Octay a process of declaration of Typical Zone, where they will identify a representative area of identity and history, which will be legally protected by the State of Chile.

Family Colvin was born into a military family, one of four children and the only daughter of the Boer War veteran Lt. Col. Forrester Farnell Colvin (CBE, OBE, MC, DL; died 16 February 1936) and Isabella Katherine McClintock-Bunbury (28 December 1874 ‚Äî 30 March 1963), who married on 26 July 1894. They lived at Morleys, Shermanbury Grange, Horsham, Sussex. She was a cousin of Michael Colvin, a Conservative M.P.Bunbury family genealogy site, turtlebunbury.com; accessed 1 April 2016. Career Colvin travelled widely as a young woman, to South Africa and India. She joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry in 1938, transferring to the Auxiliary Territorial Service when World War II commenced. She spent most of the war as a driver, then commanded a Central Ordnance Depot Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) Group at Weedon, Northamptonshire (1943‚Äì44). Immediately after the end of hostilities with Germany, she was posted to Hamburg to help oversee its transition to democracy and build up the local council and basic services such as housing. After two years of throwing herself into this work, she was awarded an OBE, but had to return to Britain to be nearer to her ailing and elderly relatives. She supervised the transition of the ATS into the Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC), including moving its officer training school to Hindhead and bringing the training closer to that of male recruits. Female recruitment was low by 1954, so she was appointed to reverse the trend; designing a popular uniform for officers was part of her strategy. After more postings to Scotland and Eastern Command, in 1957 she was appointed WRAC director, still not yet 50, and two years later was given DBE. In 1961 she went to Copenhagen as Britain's main delegate to the inaugural NATO meeting of the women's services; her international peers elected her their spokeswoman. That year she retired, after 23 years' service. She devoted much of the next 25 years to the British Horse Society, working her way up from dressage judge to president. She hunted with the Blackmore Vale and lent her indoor riding school to the Rutland club (which did not have its own premises).Rutland Riding Club history , rutlandridingclub.co.uk; accessed 1 April 2016.
