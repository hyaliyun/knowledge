Based on Lakshminath Bezbaroa's play about the 17th-century Ahom princess Soti Joymoti, the film was produced and directed by the noted Assamese poet, author, and film-maker Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, and starred Aideu Handique and acclaimed stage actor and playwright Phani Sarma. The film, shot between 1933 and 1935,Tamuli, Babul (2002) , The Assam Tribune. was released by Chitralekha Movietone in 1935 and marked the beginning of Assamese cinema. Joymoti was screened at the 50th International Conference of the Society For Cinema and Media Studies (SCMC) of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, United States in March 2011. Other screenings include: * India- Bangladesh Joint Celebration of 100 Years of Indian Cinema, Dhaka (2012) * UCLA's Centre for India and South Asia Studies, Los Angeles (April 2010) * Osian-Cinefan's 10th Film Festival of Asian and Arabic Cinema, New Delhi (2008) * Filmb√ºro Baden W√ºrttemberg's Internationales Indisches Filmfestival, Stuttgart (2006) * Asiaticafilmidale (Encounters with Asian Cinema), Rome (2006) * Munich Film Festival (2006). Although never a commercial success, Joymoti was noted for its political views and the use of a female protagonist, something almost unheard of in Indian cinema of the time. The film was the first Indian talkie to have used Dubbing and Re-recording Technology,Jyoti Prasad Agarwala and his films and the first to engage with \\"realism\\" and politics in Indian cinema.Mazid, Altaf (2006), \\"Joymoti : The first radical film of India\\" , Himal Magazine, March 2006. The original print containing entire length of the film was thought to be lost after India's division in 1947. However, in 1995, documentary film director Arnab Jan Deka managed to recover entire footage of the lost film at a Studio in Bombay in intact condition, and reported back the matter to Assam Government apart from writing about this recovery in Assamese daily Dainik Asam and English daily The Assam Express'. Meanwhile, some reels of another remaining print of the film maintained by Hridayananda Agarwala has been restored in part by Altaf Mazid.Interview with Altaf Mazid, \\"Restoring Joymoti\\" , Himal Magazine, March 2006. Plot summary Set in 17th-century Assam, the film recounts the sacrifice of Joymoti, an Ahom princess tortured and killed by the Ahom king Borphukan for refusing to betray her husband Gadapani by disclosing his whereabouts. The event is interpreted in contemporary patriotic terms, and calls for a greater harmony between the people of the hills and those of the plains. The hills are represented by the leader Dalimi, a Naga tribeswoman who shelters the fugitive Prince Gadapani. Background  200px On his way back from England, Jyoti Prasad Agarwala spent about six months at the UFA Studios in Berlin, learning film-making. Once back in Assam, he decided to make his first film. He established Chitraban Studios at the Bholaguri Tea Estate. Two camps were established: one near the Manager's Bungalow for the female artists, and the other near the tea factory for the male artists. Tea was manufactured by day, and by night actors performed at their rehearsals. Members of the cast were encouraged to keep up their physical exercises to stay fit. A special property room was constructed, in which Jyoti Prasad Agarwala collected traditional costumes, ornaments, props, hats, etc. This grew into a museum. Technicians were brought in from Lahore; ice, transported from Calcutta. The film was taken to Lahore for editing, at which stage Agarwala discovered there was no sound for one half of the film. Unable to marshal the actors once again from their native places due to various constraints, he hired a sound studio and dubbed the voices of all male and female characters. On a single day, he recorded six thousand feet of film. This unplanned accomplishment made Jyotiprasad Agarwala the first Indian filmmaker to have introduced Dubbing and Re-recording Technology in Talkies.Bora, Prafulla Prasad: \\"Film Making in Assam\\", The Brahmaputra Beckons, 1982. Plot background Joymoti was the wife of the Ahom prince Gadapani. During the Purge of the Princes from 1679 to 1681 under King Sulikphaa (Loraa Roja), instigated by Laluksola Borphukan, Gadapani took flight. Over the next few years, he sought shelter at Sattras (Vaishnav monasteries) and the adjoining hills outside the Ahom kingdom. Failing to trace Prince Gadapani, Sulikphaa's soldiers brought his wife Joymoti to Jerenga Pathar where, despite brutal and inhuman torture, the princess refused to reveal the whereabouts of her husband. After continuous physical torture over 14 days, Joymoti breathed her last on 13 Choit of 1601 Saka, or 27 March, AD 1680. Joymoti's self-sacrifice would bear fruit in time: Laluk was murdered in November 1680 by a disgruntled body of household retainers. The ministers, now roused to a sense of patriotism, sent out search parties for Gadapani who, gathering his strength, returned from his exile in the Garo Hills to oust Sulikphaa from the throne. Joymoti had known that her husband alone was capable of ending Sulikphaa-Laluk's reign of terror. For her love and her supreme sacrifice for husband and country, folk accounts refer to her as a Soti. Reception The film was released on 10 March 1935, at the Raonak Theatre, and was inaugurated by the Assamese writer Lakshminath Bezbarua. In Guwahati, it was screened at the Kumar Bhaskar Natya Mandir, the only cinema in Assam which then had sound. The film was not well received, consequently suffering a debilitating financial loss. It was able to collect only INR 24,000 from its screenings, less than half its budget of INR 50,000 (at the time), which today amounts to INR 75,00,000. Overview thumb Joymoti, a study of the culture and history of Assam, carried with it the bright possibility of a film tradition. The significant similarities with the Russian montage reflect an element of influence. The film is noted for its constantly changing angles, unique sets (built from scratch on a tea plantation, with local materials), and other stylistics tactics employed by the imaginative Jyoti Prasad in this his film debut. By then a published poet and writer, his lyricism is clearly evident in this pioneering film. Technical aspects The film was shot on a 4267.20 m-length film. Filming  Joymati during production For all indoor shooting, Jyoti Prasad set up a studio at Bholaguri Tea Estate, near Gohpur, which was owned by the Agarwala family. Named Chitraban, the studio was built using local materials such as wood, bamboo, and banana stumps. The set was artistically designed by Jyoti Prasad himself using bamboo mats, japis of different sizes, deer horns, buffalo horns, and NƒÅga spears. To furnish the royal court of the Ahoms, he used regal utensils such as maihang, hengdang, bhogjara, bata, sariya, and banbata. He imported a Faizi sound-recording system from Lahore, and the first camera into Assam from Mehta of Calcutta. The unit arrived at Bholaguri Tea Estate in December 1933 to commence filming, and camped in front of the garden factory. Jyoti Prasad arranged all accommodation arrangements personally, and set up a laboratory for developing film by the side of his ‚ÄòChitraban‚Äô studio. According to Natasurya Phani Sarma, who played a key role in the film, Chitraban was not merely a studio, but a film-training institute in itself. Apart from the acting, Jyoti Prasad also taught his actors certain film-making techniques-- such as developing, processing, printing, and editing--and shared with them his knowledge of various film shots like mixed shot, fade out, zoom, dissolve, back projection, and model shooting. The 17th-century costumes used in the film were designed by Jyoti Prasad, and the make-up was done by the actors themselves, assisted by Sonitkowar Gajen Borua. The first ever Assamese film studio at the Bholaguri Tea Estate Although shooting at the Chitraban Studio started in April 1933, it faced an initial delay as Jyoti Prasad was unable to find a suitable young woman to play \\"Joymoti\\", as well as actors for a few other roles. He floated newspaper advertisements for actors and actresses, mentioning brief outlines of the film and descriptions of the characters. His idea was to get ‚Äòtypes‚Äô for his characters, not seasoned actors, even offering remunerations for successful candidates. One of his preconditions was that potential actors needed to be from ‚Äòrespectable‚Äô families, as opposed to red- light areas, as had been the case during the 1930s in Calcutta. This was inspired by Jyoti Prasad's desire to liberate cinema from that \\"uncertain\\" reputation. After a prolonged search and detailed interviews, he discovered Aideu Handique in a remote village near Golaghat, for the role of Joymoti: she was to become the first actress of Assamese cinema. He then brought together the other chosen actors, of whom some had never seen a film, to acquaint them with his characters. He sought out a film-making trio, Bhupal Shankar Mehta and the Faizi Brothers from Lahore, as cameraman and sound-recordists. During filming, the rainy season was to prove a challenge to developments in the technical process, with Jyoti Prasad having to suspend shooting for several days at a time, due to insufficient light in the absence of outdoor electricity. Shooting was carried out under sunlight by using reflectors. When the rain stopped, the banana stumps used to build the splendid Ahom court dried out under the sunlight, yet filming continued - japis ingeniously fastened over the dry patches. Filming was eventually completed in August 1934, and Joymoti released in early 1935 after Jyoti Prasad had completed his own editing.

In the early 1970s, Jyoti Prasad‚Äôs youngest brother, Hridayananda Agarwala, found seven reels of the lone print of Joymoti while cleaning junk out of his garage. Jyoti Prasad‚Äôs venture, with its considerable losses, had cost the family plantation dearly, placing his family in acute difficulties. The condition of the reels, by the early 1970s, was abysmal, but his brother Hridayananda commissioned the well-known Assamese director Bhupen Hazarika to direct the long 1976 documentary Rupkonwar Jyotiprasad aru Joymoti, in which the reels were incorporated. The documentary thereby saved the reels, which have been copied and remastered since. Then, in 1995, popular Assamese story-writer, novelist, engineer, actor, screenwriter and documentary film director Arnab Jan Deka, recovered the original intact print of the film, containing the entire footage, at a Studio in Bombay. This original print of Joymoti was thought to be lost after India's division in 1947, as it was left behind in a studio in Lahore, now in Pakistan. Somehow the print, together with other films, travelled from Lahore and resurfaced in India's film capital. After making this great recovery, Arnab Jan Deka reported the matter to the Assam Government, and wrote about this recovery in the Assamese daily Dainik Asam and the English daily The Assam Express. Other leading English and Hindi newspapers, like The North East Times, The News Star, and Purvanchal Prahari, published extensive reports about Arnab Jan Deka's phenomenal discovery. This film's director Jyotiprasad Agarwala's younger brother, Hridayananda Agarwala, and the famous Assamese actor-playwright, Satya Prasad Barua, also confirmed and publicly acknowledged Arnab Jan Deka's great recovery through two separate articles in the Dainik Asam and the highly circulated English daily The Assam Tribune in 1996. This matter was also debated at Assam Legislative Assembly, and Secretary, Cultural Affairs Department of Assam Government, convened an official meet to discuss this matter together with other issues pertaining to development of Assamese films. In 2011 Arnab Jan Deka again wrote in detail about this entire episode in the prestigious Assamese literary journal Prantik. The fate of Chitraban Situated about 10 km west of Gohpur, Jyoti Prasad's temporary film studio ‚ÄòChitraban‚Äô, at Bholaguri Tea Estate, today stands deserted, a nostalgic nod to its glorious past. Once owned by Jyoti Prasad, the tea plantation passed on to the Assam Tea Corporation in 1978. The garden, where Jyoti Prasad single-handedly laid the foundation stone of Assamese cinema, now lies abandoned. The bungalow, where he composed the music for Joymoti on his organ, still stands - albeit in a dilapidated condition.

He became a Conservative Party Member of Parliament, during which he founded an alliance to protect the middle class. Family origin Price was the son of a builder's labourer and was born in London. He attended Hungerford Road School and Holloway County School but left at the age of 15 to join a paper manufacturer. Later, he set up his own business, Price, Topley and Company Ltd, who were paper merchants. Municipal life He became an active member of the Conservative Party and, in 1944, he was co-opted as a member of Lewisham Borough Council, elections having been suspended for the duration of the Second World War. He enjoyed municipal life and, in 1946, he was chosen as Conservative candidate for Lewisham West for the London County Council. He was elected by 578 votes.\\"The New L.C.C.\\", The Times, 9 March 1946. This gave Price a prominent role in London-wide Conservative politics. After boundary changes, Price was re-elected in 1949.Alan Willis and John Woollard, \\"Twentieth Century Local Election Results\\" vol. 1, Local Government Chronicle Elections Centre, 2000. Parliament At the 1950 general election, Price was chosen as Conservative candidate for Lewisham West. He gained the seat from Arthur Skeffington, who had held it as a Labour MP. His maiden speech on 22 May dwelt on the subject of high housing rents; he urged that the period for repayment of public works loans be lengthened from 60 to 80 years.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 23 May 1950. Fighting for re-election in 1951, Price reported that his audiences were \\"flabbergasted\\" to learn the high level of spending by the Labour government.\\"Mr. Morrison's 'Scrambler'\\", The Times, 17 October 1951. Advancement After his re-election, Price was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Geoffrey Lloyd.

European immigrant and European American culture From its start in the late 19th century, near North Omaha was the location of a mixed European immigrant community that also became a center for the African-American community. The Jewish community in the area was rich, with several synagogues the provided social and cultural activities. Similarly, Catholic parishes in the area welcomed Irish and German immigrants.Street of Dreams Nebraska Public Television Far North Omaha, near Florence, was home to an almost exclusively Scandinavian immigrant community. With a variety of churches and social clubs, this neighborhood was a cultural center for many of North Omaha's working class and middle class whites. Los of industrial jobs in the late 1950s and 1960s accelerated changes in the neighborhood. It became predominantly African American and many people have suffered from unemployment. African American culture North Omaha has long been the location of a thriving community of African Americans. Early arrivals came mostly after Reconstruction, but the greatest number of migrants came after 1910. Blacks have contributed extensively to the economic, political and moral compass of Omaha. While struggling with racial tension, many African Americans have become involved in the civil rights movement. Suburbanization In the late 19th century near North Omaha, closer to the downtown core, was home to many working class, middle class, and upper class WASP and Jewish families. Numerous churches, synagogues, social and civic clubs, and other cultural activities from that time continue to this day, despite the expansion of population gravitating to West Omaha in several waves of suburbanization. For instance, the City of Omaha noted in a landmark designation that Calvin Memorial Presbyterian Church, \\"... reflects the change of North Omaha from an affluent white suburb to a black inner city neighborhood and the manner in which many area churches were established, changed ownership and merged.\\"(n.d.) Calvin Memorial Presbyterian Church (originally North Presbyterian Church) City of Omaha's Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission. Some churches and residential areas demonstrated racial discrimination. A 1966 documentary examining efforts in Omaha to change segregation was A Time for Burning. North Omaha's working class, middle class, and upper class white history is evidenced in the architecture of many neighborhoods, several notable mansions, progressive apartment building designs, and other churches or former synagogues spread throughout the area. This is especially evident in the Kountze Place neighborhood, which is recognized as an area of historical importance for its architecture.

Noble (September 4, 1923 ‚Äì November 10, 2007) was an American survivor of the Soviet Gulag system, who wrote two books which described his experiences in it after he was permitted to leave the Soviet Union and return to the United States. Early life and education Noble was born in Detroit, Michigan. His father, who was born in Germany, came to the U.S. as a Seventh- day Adventist missionary in 1922. Finding contradictions in church teachings, he eventually left the church. His mother, a photographer, worked in a photo- finishing company in Detroit and his father became the owner of the company. The Nobles eventually built the company to become one of the top ten photo- finishing companies in the U.S. His father was an acquaintance of a German camera manufacturer who wanted to immigrate to the U.S. and offered to trade his camera factory in Dresden for the Nobles‚Äô company. The German company, which was already notable and would later create landmarks such as the Praktica, became a major international brand, employing 600 workers at the business‚Äô peak. The Nobles stayed in Nazi Germany during World War II and survived the Allies' firebombing of Dresden in February 1945. Imprisonment=Special Soviet Prison In late 1945, 22-year-old U.S.-born Noble was arrested together with his father by Soviet occupation forces in Dresden and incarcerated at the NKVD special camp Nr. 2 which was located on part of the former Buchenwald concentration camp site. The arrest came about after a newly appointed local Soviet commissar decided to appropriate the Noble family's Practica brand Kamera-Werkstaetten Guthe & Thorsch factory and its stocks of quality cameras. A trumped-up allegation of spying against the Soviets was levelled against the two male members of the family. However, the commissar did not provide a sufficient number of the cameras to his superiors, and as punishment, he was arrested and subsequently became a fellow prisoner. Unlike his father Charles A. Noble, who was released in 1952, John was sentenced to a further 15 years in 1950, and was transferred to the Soviet Gulag system when Special Prison Number 2 was closed in early 1950. Vorkuta During his transfer through the Soviet Union, he saw the English phrase \\"I am sick and don't expect to live through this - Major Roberts\\" scrawled on a cell wall. The inscription which was dated mid-August 1950 is believed to have been written by U.S. soldier Major Frank A. Roberts who is recorded as missing in action during World War II. Soon afterwards, Noble's journey continued and he was sent to the Vorkuta Gulag, at the northernmost Urals railhead in Siberia. Doing a variety of menial jobs during his imprisonment, the highest being a uniformed lavatory attendant for the staff, he took part in the Vorkuta uprising of July 1953 as a prominent leader. According to Noble the Vorkuta camp and many other camps which were located nearby had previously been taken over by the inmates, including 400 purged Soviet ex-World War II military men who desperately opted to march their way several hundred miles west to Finland. Apparently making it halfway en route, those inmates were intercepted and either killed in battle or executed immediately afterwards. All of the camps soon returned to state control. Noble eventually managed to smuggle out a postcard which was loosely glued to another prisoner's back. The message which was addressed to a relative in West Germany was passed to his family, who by then had returned to the United States. The postcard was passed to the U.S. Department of State which formally requested that the Soviet government release Noble. He was finally released in 1955, together with several U.S. military captives, thanks to the personal intervention of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\\"An American Survivor of the Post-war Gulag\\" Later life By the mid-1990s, Noble was again residing in Dresden, the city where he had been taken prisoner 50 years earlier. The factory building, but not its trademark \\"Praktica\\", which had been created independently, had been restored to his family's ownership. He died on November 10, 2007 after suffering a heart attack. Noble wrote the following three books about his ordeal: *I Found God in Soviet Russia, by John Noble and Glenn D Everett (1959, hardcover). *I Was a Slave in Russia, by John Noble (Broadview, Illinois: Cicero Bible Press, 1961). *Amerikanetz, by John Noble (Faith & Freedom Forum, 1986). *Verbannt und Verleugnet (Banished and Vanished), by John H.

She was a nun of the Dominican convent of St. Catherine of Siena located in Piazza San Marco, Florence, and was heavily influenced by the teachings of Savonarola and by the artwork of Fra Bartolomeo.  Life  Pulisena Margherita Nelli was born into a wealthy family in the San Felice area of Florence. Her father, Piero di Luca Nelli, was a successful fabric merchant and her ancestors originated from the Tuscan valley area of Mugello, as did the Medici dynasty. There is a modern- day street in Florence, Via del Canto de‚Äô Nelli, in the San Lorenzo district, named for her family, and the New Sacristy of the Church of San Lorenzo is the original site of her family homes. She became a nun at the age of fourteen, taking on the name Suor Plautilla, at the convent of Santa Caterina di Cafaggio; she would later be prioress on three occasions. The facility was managed by the Dominican friars of San Marco, led by Savonarola. About half of all educated girls in that era were placed into convents to avoid the cost of raising a dowry. Savonarola's preachings promoted devotional painting and drawing by religious women to avoid sloth, thus the convent became a center for nun-artists. Her sister, also a nun, Costanza, (Suor Petronilla) wrote a life of Savonarola. Nelli had the favor of many patrons (including women), executing large pieces and miniatures. Sixteenth-century art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote, \\"and in the houses of gentlemen throughout Florence, there are so many pictures, that it would be tedious to attempt to speak of them all.\\" Fra' Serafino Razzi, a sixteenth-century Dominican Friar, historian and Savonaroliano (disciple of Savonarola), named three nuns of Santa Caterina as disciples of Plautilla, Suor Prudenza Cambi, Suor Agata Trabalesi, Suor Maria Ruggieri, and three others as additional producers: Suor Veronica, Suor Dionisia Niccolini, and his sister Suor Maria Angelica Razzi.  Art and style  Though she was self-taught, she copied works of the mannerist painter Agnolo Bronzino and high Renaissance painter Andrea del Sarto. Her primary source of inspiration came from copying works of Fra Bartolomeo, which mirrored the classicism-style enforced by Savonarola's artistic theories. Fra Bartolomeo left his drawings to his pupil, Fra Paolino who, in turn left them in the possession of \\"a nun who paints\\" in the convent of Santa Caterina da Siena. Nelli signed her paintings as \\"Pray for the Paintress\\" after her name, confirming her role in spite of her gender.https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/19/renaissance-nun- regains-place-in-art-history-the-last-supper, Restored to glory: How a 16th- century nun regained her place in art history Confined to a monastery by her parents, Plautilla Nelli became one of the Renaissance‚Äôs few female artists. Her forgotten masterpiece, The Last Supper, has now been resurrected Her work is distinguished from that of her influencers by the heightened sentiment she added to each of her characters' expressions. Author Jane Fortune referred to her Lamentation with Saints and the \\"raw emotional grief surrounding Christ‚Äôs death as depicted through the red eyes and visible tears of its female figures\\" as a case in point. Nelli's Lamentation, which is now in the Museum of San Marco, Florence, has also spurred the writings of The Painter-Prioress of Renaissance Florence, written by Jonathan K. Nelson. Most of Nelli's works are large-scale, which was most uncommon for a woman to paint, in her era. She is one of the few female artists mentioned in Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects. Her work is characterized by religious themes, with vivid portrayals of emotion on her characters' faces. Nelli lacked any formal training and her male figures are said to have ‚Äúfeminine characteristics‚Äù, as her religious vocation prohibited study of the nude male.  Works created, rediscovered, and restored  Nelli produced mainly devotional pieces including large-scale paintings, wood lunettes, book illustrations, and drawings. Her paintings include Lamentation with Saints (in the large refectory, San Marco Museum, restored 2006), Saint Catherine Receives the Stigmata and Saint Dominic Receives the Rosary, in the Andrea del Sarto Last Supper Museum of San Salvi, both restored in 2008. Nelli's Grieving Madonna, also at San Salvi, is a copy of the same subject by Alessandro Allori. Her Crucifixion is exhibited in the Certosa di Galluzzo Monastery, near Florence. The Last Supper, in the refectory of Santa Maria Novella (not open to the public), is the only work Nelli signed. Her nine drawings in the Uffizi‚Äôs Department of Prints and Drawings were restored in 2007 and include several representations of the human figure such as Bust of a Young Woman, Head of a Youth, Kneeling Male Figure. The Pentecost, in Perugia‚Äôs Basilica of San Domenico, is another of her most significant works, as well as her Annunciation and St. Catherine of Siena both preserved at the Uffizi. The Last Supper, a 7x2-meter oil-on-canvas, preserved in the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella, is the only signed work by Plautilla Nelli known to survive. Painted in the 1560s, Nelli's Last Supper is a first rendered by a woman. Florence has the richest tradition of paintings with the theme of the Last Supper in the world. Her most significant work because of its size and subject, it is a seven-meter long oil on canvas. Last Supper was under restoration for four years. The work then went on exhibit in October 2019 at the Santa Maria Novella Museum in Florence, across from Alessandro Allori‚Äôs painting with the same theme, also painted in the sixteenth century. Nelli‚Äôs work represents a daring creative endeavor for a nun-artist of her period, as most were relegated to producing miniatures, textiles, or small sculptures in painted terra cotta or wood. By creating and signing this enormous fresco-like work depicting one of Florence‚Äôs most beloved spiritual subjects, Nelli successfully placed herself among the ranks of her male counterparts, such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Andrea del Sarto and Domenico Ghirlandaio, an accomplishment lost to history for many centuries. Due to the recent restoration of the Lamentation, there has been more investigation into Nelli‚Äôs life and art.  Documentary  The Restoration of Lamentation with Saints: Plautilla Nelli is a thirty-six-minute documentary on the life of Nelli and on the process of restoring of one of her most significant large-scale paintings. The documentary, produced in 2007 by Art Media Studio, Florence, was developed and funded by The Advancing Women Artists Foundation's founder Jane Fortune and The Florence Committee of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. The documentary explores the preparatory drawings beneath the painting's pictorial surface using the process of reflectography. It shows various steps of the restoration project safeguarding the painting against woodworms, found in the painting's wood panel and exterminated, and centuries of encrusted dust and dirt. The documentary's main protagonists include museum executives and art conservation experts such as the San Marco Museum director Dr. Magnolia Scudieri and Florentine restorer Rossella Lari. The restored painting was completed in October 2006, and unveiled at Florence's San Marco Museum where it is exhibited in the large refectory. In her closing comment, Scudieri states, \\"Not only can we more clearly see the painting's expressive intensity thanks to this restoration, we can also more fully understand the convent life of Plautilla Nelli and her time in Florence.  PBS television documentary  The Emmy-winning PBS television documentary (June, 2013) Invisible Women, Forgotten Artists of Florence, based on Dr. Jane Fortune‚Äôs book by the same title, features a segment on Suor Plautilla Nelli and the restoration of the Lamentation with Saints.

Humphrey developed the SWOT analysis technique while working for the Stanford Research Institute, now known as SRI International. SWOT is a strategic planning method used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses/Limitations, Opportunities, and Threats involved in a project or in a business venture. The origin of the term SWOT remains obscure.  Education  Albert Humphrey was educated at the University of Illinois, where he graduated with a B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering. After this he gained a master's degree in chemical engineering at M.I.T. and an MBA at Harvard University.  Career  His work at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) produced a team method for planning which created SOFT analysis and this was developed into SWOT analysis. One client was W.H. Smith (1970‚Äì1987), which aligned its annual budget to long-range planning. This programme was the first to use the concept of employee involvement in business planning and can be seen as sowing the seeds for the Investors in People scheme. While continuing work at Stanford, Humphrey was involved with the team that came up with the Stakeholder Concept, which has often been referenced by business leaders, economists and politicians. This programme became known as TAM (Team Action Management). During his working life Humphrey acted as consultant to over 100 companies globally.

Its northern boundary, partially bounded by the Ballyclough River, lies some three kilometres to the south of the Limerick City boundary at Southill. The Limerick to Fedamore road (R511) bounds the west side of Roxborough. Roxborough was historically part of the civil parish of Caheravally and the Barony of Clanwilliam and comprised 526 acres, two roods and five perches.General alphabetical index to townlands and towns, parishes and baronies of Ireland of 1851. Retrieved on 25 January 2014. Roxborough is in the Roman Catholic parish of Donoughmore and Knockea, which lies in the Diocese of Limerick. It is also part of the catchment area of South Liberties GAA Club. Roxborough is designated as a district electoral division and contains the following townlands: Ashfort, Ballyclough, Ballysheedy West, Bohereen, Cahervally, Derrybeg, Friarstown, Greenhills, Lemonfield, Lickadoon, Lissanalta, Oatlands, Parkroe, Raheen, Rathuard, Rootiagh, Routagh, Roxborough and Toberyquin. The Roxborough Electoral Division had a population of 1,601 at the Census of Ireland 2011, consisting of 810 males and 791 females and represented a 0.2% decline from the 2006 census.  History  Baile an R√≥stigh translates as \\"Roche's townland\\" and this name almost certainly derives from the Roche family who were associated with King James II. Dominic Roche was ennobled by the King and given large tracts of land in Cahervally, including what is now known as Roxborough. He took the title of Viscount Cahervalla.Joyce, G., 1995, Limerick City Street Names, Limerick Corporation, p. 126. During the Cromwellian Plantation, all of the Roche lands, including Roxborough, were confiscated and given to the Hollow Sword Blade Company, which, in spite of its name, was a bank. A Colonel Thomas Vereker of Cork purchased the land from the Hollow Sword Blade Company during the reign of Queen Anne and constructed Roxborough House. According to Spellissy, \\"he built his mansion in a park laid out with canals, terraces and hedges, in the stiff Dutch fashion.\\" His son, Charles Vereker, was created Viscount Gort in 1817. The property was extensively rebuilt by a Major Vereker in 1832 for approximately ¬£1200. It was placed on the market in June 1852 and again in June 1853, when it was possibly purchased by the McMurray family, who were certainly resident by 1862. In the 1870s, John Ripley McMurray, Sub Lieutenant in the 12th Dragoon Guards, of Roxborough House, Limerick and Patrickswell is recorded as owning 1,931 acres in county Limerick.Landed Estates Database, Moore Institute, National University of Ireland, Galway.Return of Owners' of Lands of One Acre and Upwards, 1876.

Shaw of The Shaw Bacon Company, Limerick.Spellissy, S, 1989, Limerick, The Rich Land, Spellissy & O'Brien, p.130. Due to the extensive civil unrest of the period following the Acts of Union in 1800 and the Napoleonic Wars, many police barracks were constructed in the region and one was built at Power's Cross in Roxborough in the 1830s.Ryan, T., 1996, The 1841 Census, The Old Limerick Journal, Winter Edition, pp. 25-26.  Education  According to the history of Roxborough National School, Alexander W. Shaw established a school at a dwelling house in 1889. He was in residence at Roxborough House at this time and this dwelling was in fact the Gate Lodge of that house. This school catered for 64 pupils, 40 girls and 24 boys, and a Ms Briget O'Brien was the first teacher appointed.History of Roxborough School. Retrieved 27 January 2014. Construction began on a new school in 1911 and this was opened on 6 May 1912. It is a standard school building type of the period with two classrooms divided by timber and glazed partition. Each room had its own fireplace and the building was fronted by an entrance porch allowing separate access to each room. This building is now on the Limerick County Council list of protected structures.Limerick County Council Record of Protected Structures. Retrieved on 27 January 2014. The school continued to grow and a number of prefabricated buildings were added to the site during the 1960s and 1970s. Extensive fund raising, led by the then Principal, Sean Marrinan, eventually led to a new school being constructed and opened in 1985\\\\. This school is located some 250m south of the 1911 school and is now one of the largest primary schools in Co Limerick.  Spelling and misuse  The spelling of Roxborough has sometimes been shortened to Roxboro, largely due to the modern spelling of the \\"Roxboro Road\\" in Limerick City (R511), which runs from the top of William Street all the way out to Roxborough. In more recent years, a number of businesses in the Rathbane and Galvone areas of Limerick City have erroneously begun to use \\"Roxboro\\" as their address in the belief that that part of the city was once part of the townland of Roxborough. This has been reinforced by the misuse of Roxborough on directional roadsigns on a section of the N18 from the Limerick Tunnel to the Junction 1 exit. It is clearly evidenced on the Ordnance Survey of Ireland's 6\\" maps (1829‚Äì41) that this is not the case.

Life James Tyrrell was born in London, the eldest son of Sir Timothy Tyrrell and Elizabeth Tyrrell (n√©e Ussher), the only daughter of Archbishop James Ussher. His younger sister Eleanor married the deist Charles Blount. He lived in Oakley, Buckinghamshire. He was married to Mary Hutchinson (1645-1687), daughter of Sir Michael Hutchinson of Fladbury, Worcestershire. They had at least three children, including James Tyrrell and Mary and another son. Educated at The Queens College, Oxford (MA, 1663), he became a barrister in 1666 and a justice of the peace in Buckinghamshire. He was deprived of this office by James II for failing to support the Declaration of Indulgence. At the time of the Peace of Rijswijk (1697), he was persuaded back into public service by Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke (Lord Pembroke) to become Commissioner of the Privy Seal. Tyrrell was a friend and supporter of John Locke, who stayed at Tyrrell's home during a period when he was apparently working on his Two Treatises on Government. Tyrrell's thinking appears to have been influential in the development of Locke's, and for a time his writings were more influential than Locke's in the emergence of Whig thinking and policies. He spent his later years in Shotover, near Oxford and began building Shotover Park there, where he died on 17 June 1718, though he is buried in the church in Oakley. According to a memorial to him, \\"He was a man of rare integrity, gravity, and wisdom: had never polished himself out of his sincerity: nor refined his behaviour to the prejudice of his virtue. He was a warm and zealous lover of his country, & of that system of religion and law which he well knew could only support it.\\" Works His Patriarcha non monarcha (1681) was a reply to Robert Filmer's Patriarcha; it also included references to Thomas Hobbes, and was also influenced by Samuel Pufendorf.The Cambridge History of Eighteenth- Century Political Thought, ed.

They interact with TGF-beta receptors. Many proteins have since been described as members of the TGF-Œ≤ family in a variety of species, including invertebrates as well as vertebrates and categorized into 23 distinct gene types that fall into four major subfamilies: * The TGF-Œ≤ subfamily * The bone morphogenetic proteins and the growth differentiation factors * The activin and inhibin subfamilies * The Left-right determination factors * A group encompassing various divergent members Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional peptide that controls proliferation, differentiation and other functions in many cell types. TGF-beta-1 is a peptide of 112 amino acid residues derived by proteolytic cleavage from the C-terminal of a precursor protein. These proteins interact with a conserved family of cell surface serine/threonine- specific protein kinase receptors, and generate intracellular signals using a conserved family of proteins called SMADs. They play fundamental roles in the regulation of basic biological processes such as growth, development, tissue homeostasis and regulation of the immune system. Structure Proteins from the TGF-beta family are only active as homo- or heterodimer; the two chains being linked by a single disulfide bond. From X-ray studies of TGF-beta-2, it is known that all the other cysteines are involved in intrachain disulfide bonds. As shown in the following schematic representation, there are four disulfide bonds in the TGF-beta's and in inhibin beta chains, while the other members of this family lack the first bond. interchain  +--+     +-+ +--+  +--+ where 'C' denotes a conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

She appeared in Wigstock and was featured in Jennie Livingston's 1990 documentary Paris Is Burning.  Early life and education  Corey was born in Buffalo, New York to Franklin Legg and Mary Fox Clark out of wedlock though they later married October 18, 1947. Raised on a farm in Buffalo, Dorian began performing in drag, and later transitioned into a woman when leaving the city. In the 1950s, she worked as a window dresser at Hengerer's, then moved to New York City to study art at Parsons.  Career  In the 1960s, Dorian toured as a snake dancer in the Pearl Box Revue, a cabaret drag act. She was one of four performers who appeared on the 1972 Pearl Box Revue LP Call Me MISSter. Corey was also the founder of the voguing House of Corey. She held over 50 grand prizes from the voguing balls. She was also \\"house mother\\" to Angie Xtravaganza, who later became a mother of her own house and was also in Paris Is Burning. Corey also ran and designed a clothing label called Corey Design. At one point, Corey's act involved her wearing a 30-by-40-foot feather cape. Once she shed her costume down to a sequined body stocking, two attendants raised the cape up on poles to produce a feathered tent that covered half the audience.  Death and legacy  On August 29, 1993, Corey died of AIDS-related complications at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan at the age of 56. After her death, the preserved body of Robert Worley (aka Robert Wells) was found in Corey's belongings with a gunshot wound to the head. Investigators determined the body had been dead for approximately 15 years. It's speculated that Worley was an abusive ex- lover of Corey, or that Corey may have murdered him in self-defense during a lovers' quarrel or during an attempted burglary, as such types of abuse were common among New York's trans community at the time. After death, her cremated remains were sent back to Buffalo, New York but were unclaimed and later disposed of. Nevertheless, an image of Corey is sometimes found in voguing events where her image and legacy are memorialized.  In fiction  In the third episode (\\"Butterfly/Cocoon\\") of Pose season two, transgender house mother Elektra, who secretly works as a dominatrix in a BDSM club, discovers one of her clients has died from an overdose in her private dungeon. She enlists the aid of other characters to transport, mummify, and hide the body in a trunk. Producer and director Janet Mock confirmed on Twitter that writer Our Lady J based the anthology melodrama on Corey.

Northampton School, Wed June 23, 2010, 7:30pm  New school building  The original high school building was replaced by a new building. The original building was demolished with the exception of the 1971 science wing, which at the time included the swimming pool, library spaces, science classrooms, and a large open classroom known as the business technology center. Construction began in 2011 and continued until April 2013. The renovated natatorium (swimming pool) and locker rooms opened in the fall of 2012, and the new school building which was constructed southeast of the original building opened on February 25, 2013, following the school's winter vacation. The new building consists of a new core section with the auditorium at its center and surrounded by a circular lobby. Around the lobby in this portion are the cafeteria, school office, library, computer lab, and special subject classrooms. The main two story academic wing housing most of the school's classrooms extends out to the west from the core lobby area. North of the core lobby is the new gymnasium and athletic and physical education spaces as well as the renovated 1971 wing which was completed during the summer of 2013. The reused wing was nearly completely gutted on the inside and received a completely new brick facade to match the new 2013 building with only the swimming pool and its locker rooms remaining laid out as they were originally built. The portion of the wing where the media center was now contains the fitness center, a new PE room containing a wooden dance floor, the health classroom, and a new business technology center. The northernmost part of the wing is separated from the school proper by security doors. It contains the offices of the school department and LCTV, the town's community access TV channel. A parking lot and drop-off now occupies the space where the former building stood. A new athletic field is located where the former student parking lot was located. A ceremony was held in September 2013 for the completion of the new high school building. The new school was built at an estimated cost of $78.4 million, and was partially funded by the Massachusetts School Building Authority. The town's portion was $44 million and included required matching funds for the MSBA's portion of the project as well as the full costs for the demolition and renovation parts of the project as they were outside the scope of the MSBA's approved program.  Original school building  The original school was constructed in 1954, with subsequent additions in 1958, 1963, 1971, 1999, and 2009. The renovations created courtyards surrounded by corridors. By the turn of the millennium, the high school supported a peak occupancy of approximately 3,000 students. Years of mistreatment had caused serious maintenance issues over the years. In 2009, the district appropriated money to refurbish the media center, which at the time was located in the 1971 wing. In 2010, demand for a new school grew until the town voted in favor of constructing a new state-of-the-art facility. District offices were demolished the same year to make way for the proposed academic wing. Faculty and staff moved into the new building in February 2013 and by April, the building was gone.

Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand's protagonist Ren√© characterizes the Romantic ennui that would become a benchmark of the Romantic esthetic in the first half of the century: > Ren√© is a young man who was suffering from the moral malady known as \\"le mal > du si√®cle\\". This was an \\"√©tat d'√¢me\\"State of the soul that was not uncommon > during the first half of the nineteenth century, and that was often copied > and idealized in literature. It was largely boredom. Other manifestations > were: melancholy of an aristocratic type, precocious apathy, discouragement > without cause, distaste for living. The will seemed paralyzed by the > contemplation of life's struggle. Faith and a sense of duty were alike > absent. Man was \\"poss√©d√©, tourment√© par le d√©mon de son c≈ìur.\\"Possessed, > tormented by the demon of his heart Morbid sadness was mistaken for the > suffering of a proud and superior mind. There was in it all a certain > \\"bonheur d'√™tre triste\\"Happiness at being sad which attracted. This > pessimistic state was analyzed in Ren√© with great subtlety and penetration. > The hero was made a most original and living type, a type that was repeated > in the Childe Harold and Manfred of Byron, and even, in some of its > manifestations, in the Hernani of Victor Hugo. In the opinion of > Chateaubriand, Ren√© was his masterpiece. Later judgments regarding it are > not unanimous, but many authoritative French critics see in it one of the > masterpieces of their literature.Chateaubriand, Fran√ßois-Ren√©. Atala and > Ren√©. Trans. Benjamin Lester Bowen. Scott, Foresman and Company, 1901. While Chateaubriand was the first to \\"diagnose\\" this \\"illness\\", it is Alfred de Musset who further popularized the notion of a \\"mal du si√®cle\\" in his La Confession d'un enfant du si√®cle (Confession of a Child of the Century).Hoog, Armand and Brombert, Beth. \\"Who Invented the Mal du Si√®cle?\\" Yale French Studies, No. 13, Romanticism Revisited (1954), pp. 42-51 Musset notably attributed the malady to the loss of Napoleon Bonaparte, the French nation's modern father figure: > Voil√† dans quel chaos il fallut choisir alors; voil√† ce qui se pr√©sentait √† > des enfants pleins de force et d'audace, fils de l'empire et petits-fils de > la r√©volution. [...] l'esprit du si√®cle, ange du cr√©puscule, qui n'est ni la > nuit, ni le jour.Musset, Alfred de. La Confession d'un enfant du si√®cle. > Paris: Garnier-Flammarion, 1993, p. 31 > Lo and behold in what chaos, then, one must choose; behold the choice that > is given to children full of strength and audacity, sons of the Empire and > grandsons of the Revolution.

History The OPR was established in 1975 by order of then Attorney General Edward Levi, following revelations of ethical abuse and serious misconduct by senior DOJ officials during the Watergate scandal. The order directed OPR to \\"receive and review any information concerning conduct by a Department employee that may be in violation of law, regulations or orders, or applicable standards of conduct.\\"https://www.justice.gov/opr/about- opr USDOJ: Office of Professional Responsibility: About OPR Since its inception in 1975, the OPR was headed by: * 1975 - 1997 Mike Shaheen * 1998 - 2009 H. Marshall Jarrett * 2009 - 2011 Mary Patrice Brown (acting head) * 2011 - 2018 Robin Ashton Since September 2018 the OPR is headed by Corey Amundson. Mission OPR‚Äôs primary mission is to ensure that DOJ attorneys perform their duties in accordance with professional standards. The OPR promulgates independent standards of ethical and criminal conduct for DOJ attorneys, while the DOJ's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has jurisdiction of non- attorney DOJ employees. The OPR receives reports of allegations of misconduct made against DOJ attorneys from many sources. Nearly half of all such allegations are reported to OPR by DOJ sources, such as the attorney involved.USDOJ: Office of Professional Responsibility: OPR Process The remaining complaints come from a variety of sources, including private attorneys, defendants and civil litigants, other federal agencies, state or local government officials, judicial and congressional referrals, and media reports. OPR gives expedited attention to judicial findings of misconduct. The OPR reviews each allegation and determines whether further investigation is warranted. The determination is a matter of investigative judgment that weighs many factors, including the nature of the allegation, its apparent credibility, its specificity, its susceptibility to verification, and the source of the allegation. A decision to open a matter does not give rise to a presumption of misconduct, nor shift the burden of proof to the accused person. The OPR's investigations involve a wide range of allegations, and the investigative methods used vary accordingly. In many cases, the OPR notifies the accused attorney and requests a written response. Sometimes, the OPR also makes on-site investigations. The OPR reports the results of the investigation to the component head concerned and to the Office of the Deputy Attorney General. The OPR also advises the complainant and the accused attorney of its conclusion.

At the latter she came in contact with director Ingmar Bergman who directed her on stage and later would cast her in strong parts in some of his most memorable films, including Wild Strawberries (1957), The Magician / The Face (1958), The Devil's Eye (1960), All These Women (1964) and Hour of the Wolf (1967). From 1956 to 1978, Gertrud Fridh was part of the ensemble at Sweden's national stage, the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. There she performed a number of celebrated parts, from Titania in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1956) to Phaedra in Euripides' Hippolytus (1965) and The Mummy in Strindberg's The Ghost Sonata (1973). One of her most praised parts was her Hedda Gabler, in the legendary 1964 Dramaten production of the Ibsen play, directed by Bergman. The successful production gave 89 performances, and she later guest performed in Helsinki, Berlin and London. Despite the fact that many Swedish actresses have taken on the role of Hedda Gabler over the years, in Sweden, Gertrud Fridh is still regarded as the definitive Hedda of all time.

He was able to secure major contributions, not only from Van, New Julfa, and Aleppo but also from places such as Urfa, and Bitlis, virtually encouraging their competition to erase the debt.

The reusable orbiter and its external expendable fuel tank would have been launched by an Antonov AN-225 airplane, developed by Antonov ASTC (Kyiv, Ukraine). Had it been built, the system would have weighed and been capable of carrying a payload.

He is buried in the Brussels Cemetery. Anspach was born in Brussels into a family of Calvinist Genevan origin. His father Fran√ßois (died 1858) served in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives. Jules Anspach studied law at the Free University of Brussels (now split into the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel) becoming a Doctor of Laws. As with many Liberals, Anspach was a Freemason. Anspach rose rapidly, replacing Fontainas as Burgomaster of Brussels in 1863, aged only 34, holding the office until his death. He effected massive changes to the urban landscape of Brussels, centred on his oeuvre, the covering of the Senne. His renovations in Brussels paralleled those by Baron Haussmann in Paris. The modern city remains largely Anspach's creation in its basic form. Boulevard Anspach, the main artery in downtown Brussels, bears his name. It was the central boulevard created by his massive renovations of the city, so it is particularly fitting it be named after him.

History In 1962, Omaha community leader Bertha CallowayBertha Calloway founded the Negro Historical Society. In 1976 she opened the Great Plains Black History Museum, in the Western Telephone Exchange Building. This had been a community center for recovery efforts after the disastrous 1913 tornado. From 1933 to 1952, it was used by the Urban League as a community center, featuring a variety of services, such as medical, a library and others. Calloway's goal over the next 25 years was to teach Nebraskans and other visitors about the contributions of African Americans in the Midwest. In a 1996 interview Calloway explained, \\"People must see black history in order for the images they have of black people to change. That‚Äôs what our museum is all about ... revealing a history that‚Äôs been withheld.\\"Biga, L.A.

Most African Americans arrived in the Midwest from the South during the first half of the 20th century, in two waves of the Great Migration. The museum chronicles their transformation to urban workers, the development of churches and other community institutions; and music, literature and other culture.

The building needs renovation and the museum may consider moving to another facility, or running exhibits for some time in other venues. It has arranged to have the Nebraska State Historical Society take temporary custodial care of the materials. Their staff has been cataloging documents and photographs housed at the NSHS in Lincoln. As of 2010, the museum reorganized with a new board of directors, and in the spring of 2011 started a series of community meetings to discuss its future, including the possibility of exhibiting materials before a museum building is available.

An Ottoman Marbled Faturan Prayer Bead History The creation of \\"Faturan\\" is thought to have originated by a chemist. He was melting down the filings left after carving beads from amber and mixed these remnants with other natural resins, such as mastika, frankincense, colophony, and turpentine, to mold individual beads from natural substances. Unfortunately, his original formula has long since been lost. \\"Bakelite\\" and \\"Parkesine\\" are both synthetic resins named after their inventors. And so \\"Faturan\\", named after its original inventor, became a brand of cast thermosetting phenol formaldehyde resin, similar to Bakelite and Catalin, manufactured by Traun & Son of Hamburg., developed in the early 20th century, and produced until the 1940s. In the bead trade A Carved Gold Dust Faturan Prayer Bead made from North African Tribal Beads In the bead trade, \\"Faturan\\" is thought to be a mixture of natural amber shavings with other materials, and is described as having been invented in the Middle East in the 18th or 19th century, however, there is some dispute over this within the trade. The Komboloi Museum, Nafplio, Greece insists that a Kuwaiti chemist called Arabic Esmaeel Almail Faturan first made beads from amber fillings mixed with other natural resins, rather than synthetic, long before the well known synthetic resins were mass-produced. The National Historical Museum, Athens, has on display komboloi made of Faturan dating to 1821. \\"Faturan\\" became the protected brand name of one particular German company who mass- produced synthetic resin in rod form for making beads. These beads are now rare, but rarer still are the handmade beads of Arava Faturan's time. The first Bakelite that arrived in Turkey and the Middle East in the early 1900s was mainly in the form of drawer and furniture knobs and handles. This coincided with when the first prayer bead strands made of Bakelite began to appear on the market. The bead carvers, mainly in Turkey, were swift to understand that Bakelite was a material that could be well carved, had a great appearance, and could replace amber. Each master also had his secret \\"recipe\\", even heating in various liquids and oils, and making it undergo various physical or chemical processes to obtain the most beautiful product. The original and genuine Faturan beads were mainly in shades of red or yellow. The last genuine Faturan beads were made in the 1940s, and production ended mainly due to the Second World War, when the supply of raw material became very scarce. The demand for genuine Faturan, often confused for amber, has always been great among prayer bead, tesbih and komboloi collectors. Genuine pre-war Faturan, with beads still intact, in complete strands, and made from one single type of material, are considered museum items and fetch extremely high prices by both institutional and individual auction bidders.  Faturan oxidization  A 1930s Faturan Shift Knob - Oxidization means this car gear stick knob appears to be a dark cherry color on the outside. Faturan, as a material, displays an extreme example of a characteristic common to most phenolics - surface oxidization. Most phenolic will, over time, oxidize to a darker form of its original color. However, Faturan has the unique characteristic of always oxidizing to a dark red, regardless of the original color. This red color caused the material to become known as ‚Äòcherry amber‚Äô in the Middle East. If the red surface oxidization is removed, the original color of the material is exposed underneath. Faturan Shift Knob cut into segments - Once cut into segments the true color of the material is revealed as green with a translucent yellow top. Faturan types The most widely known types of Faturan is called damar. The swirls show the combination of more than one type of Faturan being mixed and combined, for example, transparent mixed with a dark color. Most Ottoman Faturan prayer beads were made from Faturan rods that have a swirl effect. This is called \\"eye damar\\". Gold Faturan The properties found inside Faturan determine its desirability and value, the most valuable being gold, in the forms of gold leaf, dust or metal, added when molten. Gold Faturan was used for making jewelry beads, rings, and accessories. Tribal beads were used as dowry gifts and for making necklaces and other jewelry in North Africa and Asia. Golden Lava Flow Faturan One of the rarest and sought after Faturan types is called Golden Lava Flow Faturan. It is a very rare mixture that involves a complicated and costly method of preparing a combination of melted gold and infusing it with Faturan. As the gold is in a molten form when combined with Faturan, it gives the material an molten lava look. Notes An investigation into a mythical material (2015) Plastic Historical Society.

Founded in 1856, the city was abandoned, sacked, resettled and later grew to become a city with a 2010 Census population of 153,888 people. Prehistory and exploration A burial mound in upper Sherman Park The history of Sioux Falls revolves around the cascades of the Big Sioux River. The falls were created about 14,000 years ago when the last glacial ice sheet redirected the flow of the river into the large looping bends of its present course. Fueled by water from the melting ice, the river exposed the underlying Sioux quartzite bedrock, the hard pinkish stone of the falls. The quartzite itself is about a billion and a half years old. It began as sediments deposited on the bottom of an ancient, shallow sea. The lure of the falls has been a powerful influence. A prehistoric people who inhabited the region before 500 B.C. left numerous burial mounds on the high bluffs near the river. These people were followed by an agricultural society that built fortified villages on many of the same sites. Tribes of the Lakota and Dakota, widely ranging nomadic bison hunters, arrived sometime around the 18th century. Early maps indicate they used the falls as a place to rendezvous with French fur trappers, considered the first European visitors at the falls. Nineteenth century=Early visitors The falls also drew the attention of early explorers. An August 1804 journal entry of the Lewis and Clark expedition describes the falls of the \\"Soues River.\\" Famous pathfinder John C. Fremont and French scientist Joseph Nicollet explored the region in 1838 and also wrote a description of the falls. Both are considered second hand accounts rather than evidence of an actual visit. The first documented visit was by Philander Prescott, an explorer, trader, and trapper who camped overnight at the falls in December 1832. Captain James Allen led a military expedition out of Fort Des Moines in 1844. The early descriptions of the falls were published in The States and Territories of the Great West, an 1856 book by Jacob Ferris which inspired townsite developers to seek out the falls. Founding and resettlement The focus of intense land speculation activity in Minnesota and Iowa during the mid-1850s inevitably turned toward the Big Sioux River valley. Sioux Falls was founded by land speculators who hoped to build great wealth by claiming prime townsites before the arrival of railroads and settlers. Two separate groups, the Dakota Land Company of St. Paul and the Western Town Company of Dubuque, Iowa organized in 1856 to claim the land around the falls, considered a promising townsite for its beauty and water power. The Western Town Company arrived first, and was soon followed by the St. Paul-based company in 1857. Each laid out claims, but worked together for mutual protection. They built a temporary barricade of turf which they dubbed \\"Fort Sod,\\" in response to hostilities threatened by native tribes. Seventeen men then spent \\"the first winter\\" in Sioux Falls. The following year the population grew to near 40. Although conflicts in Minnehaha County between Native Americans and white settlers were few, the Dakota War of 1862 engulfed nearby southwestern Minnesota. The town was evacuated in August of that year when two local settlers were killed as a result of the conflict. The settlers and soldiers stationed here traveled to Yankton in late August 1862. The abandoned townsite was pillaged and burned. Fort Dakota, a military reservation established in present-day downtown, was established in May 1865. Many former settlers gradually returned and a new wave of settlers arrived in the following years. The population grew to 593 by 1873, and a building boom was underway in that year. Incorporation and early growth The Village of Sioux Falls, consisting of , was incorporated in 1876 by the 12th legislative assembly of the Dakota Territory, which convened in the territorial capital of Yankton. The village charter proved to be too restrictive, however, and Sioux Falls petitioned to become a city. The city charter was granted by the Dakota Territorial legislature on March 3, 1883. The arrival of the railroads ushered in the great Dakota Boom decade of the 1880s. The population of Sioux Falls mushroomed from 2,164 in 1880 to 10,167 at the close of the decade. The growth transformed the city. A severe plague of grasshoppers and a national depression halted the boom by the early 1890s. The city grew by only 89 people from 1890 to 1900. =Divorce capital of the nation= Beginning in the 1880s, a 90-day residency law and lax oversight on the part of local judges concerning sworn testimony caused word to spread across the United States that a legal divorce was easily obtained in Dakota Territory. As a result, both Sioux Falls and Fargo (in later North Dakota) became known as \\"divorce capitals\\". Thousands of people traveled to the towns seeking a divorce, with the resulting divorce rate in Minnehaha County during this period being nearly three times that of the national average. Although many local residents were unhappy with the notoriety, the surge of \\"tourists\\" necessitated the construction of a number of new hotels and restaurants, and the situation brought a level of attention uncommon for towns of a similar size. Divorce laws were tightened after statehood, and the phenomenon had ended by the early 1900s.Hasselstrom, Linda: Roadside History of South Dakota, page 49. Mountain Press Publishing Company, 1994 Twentieth century Map ofSioux Falls in 1920 With the opening of the John Morrell meat-packing plant in 1909, the establishment of an airbase and a military radio and communications training school in 1942, and the completion of the interstate highways in the early 1960s, Sioux Falls grew at a moderate but steady pace in the early and middle years of the 20th century. During this period, the city's economy was largely centered on the stockyards and the meat packing industry. Sioux Falls was home to one of the largest stockyards in the nation at the time, and the John Morrell plant was by far the largest employer in the city. Beginning in the late 20th century, Sioux Falls began growing at a considerably faster pace than during previous decades. The economy became more service-based, and word began to spread about the relatively low levels of unemployment and crime. Annexations of adjacent land in Minnehaha County became common. The first annexation of land south of 57th Street from Lincoln County was in 1969 for a municipal water tower. The next annexations from Lincoln County occurred in 1978 when a couple of new subdivisions were added. Several large shopping malls opened during the 1970s, and the retail and dining industry began to exert a growing influence on the city's economy. In 1981, Citibank transferred its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls to take advantage of recently relaxed state anti-usury laws. Several other financial companies also moved to Sioux Falls or expanded its existing business in the city, resulting in a large present-day banking and financial presence in the city.Hetland, Cara. Sioux Falls 25 years after Citibank's arrival. Minnesota Public Radio. 24 February 2006. (accessed 23 March 2007) A third factor contributing to recent growth is the expansion of the local healthcare industry. The two largest hospitals in the city, Sanford Health and Avera Health, are also the two largest present-day employers in the city.

He was the second son of Friedrich Wilhelm II, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg and Magdalene Sybille of Saxony, his second wife. Life The death of his older brother Christian (1663) made him the new heir of the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg. When his father died in 1669, Friedrich Wilhelm III succeeded him; but, because he was only twelve years old, his maternal uncles, Elector Johann Georg II of Saxony and Duke Maurice of Saxe-Zeitz, assumed the guardianship of the new duke and the regency of the duchy. Only three years later, the young duke died of smallpox shortly after returning from a trip to Dresden. His burial took place three months later, on 17 July 1672 at his father's tomb in the church of Schloss Altenburg. With his death, the branch of Saxe-Altenburg, founded in 1603, became extinct in the direct male line. Saxe-Altenburg was split between the branches of Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Weimar; but, on the basis of the will of the Duke Johann Philipp of Saxe-Altenburg (Friedrich Wilhelm III's uncle) the greater part of the duchy was retained by Saxe-Gotha, because they were the descendants of Elisabeth Sophie, the only daughter of Johann Philipp, who declared her the general heiress of the family in case of the extinction of the male line.

It was the brainchild of Italian DJ-composer-keyboardist- producer (of Kano fame), together with guitarist Luciano Ninzatti, keyboardist-programmer Matteo Bonsanto and sound engineer Massimo No√®. Their only hit single, \\"Disco Project\\", was a mashup of Pink Floyd's \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\\" and The Alan Parsons Project's \\"Mammagamma\\".  \\"Disco Project\\": the idea and the recording  The origins of \\"Disco Project\\" can be traced back to Pulga and Ninzatti's club nights as DJs. In early 1982, they realized that Pink Floyd's \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\\" and The Alan Parsons Project's equally popular \\"Mammagamma\\" were in the same tempo and, in some sections, in the same key. They proceeded to create a mix, opening with Parson's \\"Sirius\\" (another popular track from their 1982 album Eye in the Sky), then going straight into \\"Mammagamma\\" (avoiding Parsons' transition to his album's title track), over which an a cappella version of the children's choir from \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" was superimposed, with the octave bass and steady drums from \\"Mammagamma\\" running all the way through. With copyright issues preventing the two musicians from releasing the actual original tracks, they decided to play a mashup ex-novo with the aid of two top-notch session players, Ellade Bandini on drums and Pier Michelatti on bass.entry for \\"Disco Project\\" The vocals were performed by Italian-American vocalists Linda Wesley, Rossana Casale (still unknown as a solo artist at the time) and Naimy Hackett and multi-tracked at a slightly faster speed to simulate a schoolchildren's choir. The choir also followed the key shift in the music of \\"Mammagamma\\", which was not present in the original mix by Pulga and Ninzatti, and the full album version features another key shift toward the end, which was also not in the original mix and was arranged by Pulga especially for the (extended) album track. \\"Disco Project\\" was a major hit in Italy and Switzerland during the summer of 1982.http://hitparade.ch/song/Pink-Project/Disco-Project-881 Although Pink Project was meant to be a strictly anonymous act (no photos were featured on single or album releases, just futuristic-looking, vividly colored illustrations), similarly to Michael Cretu's 1990s project Enigma, the success of \\"Disco Project\\" forced the band to do a series of TV performances. The four musicians (Pulga, Ninzatti, Bandini and Michelatti) opted then for showing up dressed in black monk-like robes with black pointed hoods ‚Äì reprising the theme adopted for the cover artwork of Pink Project's original 12-inch single. The TV performances also featured a small group of school children, loosely modeled after the children featured in Alan Parker's 1982 film Pink Floyd ‚Äì The Wall, lip-synching the lyrics. A postal address for Pink Project, a P.O. box located in Hamburg, was occasionally superimposed on screen; this was also partly fake, as the box belonged to the German office of their label, Baby Records.\\"Disco Project\\" on YouTube ‚Äì a performance by the made-up band. Ninzatti's excellent rendition of David Gilmour's guitar solo, coupled with the band's mysterious look, contributed to propagate a short-lived rumour in the Italian press that Pink Project were actually original members of Pink Floyd and The Alan Parsons Project in disguise.  Subsequent career and demise  After \\"Disco Project\\", Pink Project released a handful of singles and two albums, mostly composed of more mashups, borrowing from Jean Michel Jarre, The Police, Falco, Vangelis and Deep Purple (among others). Two further singles, \\"B-Project\\"B-Project on Discogs (Michael Jackson's \\"Billie Jean\\" + The Greg Kihn Band's \\"Jeopardy\\") and \\"Hyper-Gamma-Oxyg√®ne\\" (combining The Alan Parsons Project's \\"Hyper-Gamma-Spaces\\" and Jarre's Oxyg√®ne Part IV), respectively taken from Pink Project's first and second albums DominoDomino on Discogs and Split,Split on Discogs were minor hits in 1983, like their follow- up (a combination of Space's \\"Magic Fly\\" and Romanelli's Connecting Flight entitled \\"Magic Flight\\"). Despite a substantial amount of radio play, the two albums failed to chart, and Pink Project eventually disbanded.

The publication's focus is to deliver in-depth technical expertise while observing high standards of editorial content. Radio magazine is targeted at radio broadcast engineers, technology managers and owners of radio stations, networks, and recording studios. It is owned by Future US. History BE Radio magazine, vol. 1, no. 1, published in January 1994 Radio magazine was first published in 1994 under the title BE Radio. It is, essentially, a spin-off of Broadcast Engineering magazine, which began publication in 1959. Prior to 1994, Broadcast Engineering (often known as \\"BE\\") covered radio, television, and cable broadcasting. In 1993, the editors of Broadcast Engineering, recognizing a growing divergence in the technical issues faced by radio and television broadcasting, chose to split the scope of the original magazine. This resulted in the creation of BE Radio, to cover only the radio broadcasting industry, and narrowed the scope of Broadcast Engineering to television and cable broadcasting only.Chriss Scherer, BE Radio/Radio magazine editor, 1997 to 2014. For the first year of publication, BE Radio was a supplement mailed with Broadcast Engineering to subscribers working at radio stations. In 1995, BE Radio was mailed as a stand-alone publication.Chriss Scherer, BE Radio/Radio magazine editor, 1997 to 2014. By 1997, the editorial oversight from Broadcast Engineering had ceased, and the tagline \\"From the editors of Broadcast Engineering\\" was no longer used. The two publications were completely stand-alone under one publisher.Chriss Scherer, BE Radio/Radio magazine editor, 1997 to 2014. In time, the common lineage of the two magazines was less important, and the connection was not understood by many readers. With that, the \\"BE\\" initialism ceased to have relevance for BE Radio, and in 2002 the decision was made to drop the initials from the title, leading to the title of Radio.Chriss Scherer, BE Radio/Radio magazine editor, 1997 to 2014. The March through August 2002 issues of Radio magazine have a small \\"BE\\" in the upper corner. This is because the postal permit was registered for BE Radio and not Radio, and the small addition to the cover satisfied postal regulations.Chriss Scherer, BE Radio/Radio magazine editor, 1997 to 2014. In February 2011, Radio was transferred from Penton Media to media and communications publisher NewBay Media, separating ownership of Radio from its sister publication Broadcast Engineering for the first time. Penton had decided to release all its entertainment technology titles.Chriss Scherer, BE Radio/Radio magazine editor, 1997 to 2014. Future acquired NewBay Media in 2018. The final issue of Radio magazine was published in December 2017.Chriss Scherer, BE Radio/Radio magazine editor, 1997 to 2014. Earlier use of the name Between November 1921 and February 1947 a Radio magazine was published on the west coast in either San Francisco or Los Angeles. Before 1921 it was known as Pacific Radio News and in 1947 it became Audio Engineering. The publication was highly regarded at the time, carrying articles from many of the top men in the craft. Pacific Radio Publishing also printed a series of yearly handbooks. Around 1959, William I. Orr became editor of the handbook and it achieved national distribution.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Handbooks/Radio- Handbook-15-1959.pdf ReferencesExternal links Category:Business magazines published in the United States Category:Broadcast engineering Category:Engineering magazines Category:Magazines established in 1994 Category:Professional and trade magazines Category:Radio organizations in the United States Category:Magazines published in Massachusetts ","title":"Radio (magazine)"},{"id":"10112876","text":"Meromelia is a birth defect characterized by the lacking of a part, but not all, of one or more limbs with the presence of a hand or foot.

George Eldon Ladd suggests that the Kingdom of God is \\"not only an eschatological gift belonging to the Age to Come; it is also a gift to be received in the old aeon.\\"George Eldon Ladd, A Theology of the New Testament (1993) , page 70. This approach was first developed by Geerhardus Vos, especially in his 1930 work, The Pauline Eschatology. Later, Oscar Cullmann sought to combine the \\"thorough- going eschatology\\" of Albert Schweitzer with the \\"realized eschatology\\" of C. H. Dodd.Ted M. Dorman, \\"The Future of Biblical Theology,\\" in Scott J. Hafemann (ed.), Biblical Theology: Retrospect and Prospect, p. 252. Cullmann suggested the analogy of D Day and V Day to illustrate the relationship between Jesus' death and resurrection on the one hand, and his Second Coming on the other.C. Marvin Pate, The End of the Age Has Come: The Theology of Paul, p. 33. Inaugurated eschatology was popularized by George Eldon Ladd, especially among American evangelicals. Stephen Um notes that as evangelicals \\"began to explore the meaning of inaugurated eschatology for evangelical theology, they were almost always either explicitly or implicitly in conversation with Ladd's work.\\"Stephen T. Um, The Kingdom of God, p. 32. D. A. Carson sees John 5:24 (\\"whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life\\", NIV) as giving the \\"strongest affirmation of inaugurated eschatology in the Fourth Gospel\\": it is not necessary for the believer to \\"wait until the last day to experience something of resurrection life.\\"D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Apollos, 1991), p. 256. Some view Inaugurated Eschatology as a Kingdom theology that goes against a literal reading of Kingdom passages in the New Testament. They point to passages such as Acts 1:6 where the Apostles are seen awaiting the restoration of the Kingdom to Israel immediately prior to the ascension of Jesus as demonstrating that the Kingdom has not been established in any way.

For the final few months of the series, only David Frost was hosting the show. In addition to Saturdays, there were also editions on Fridays and Sundays. The show saw the first appearances on television of John Bird, Eleanor Bron, Roy Hudd, and John Fortune. Michael Crawford also featured as 'Byron'. The format alternated satire with chat; the trio of hosts were joined by three guests including regulars Patrick Campbell, Gerald Kaufman and Harvey Orkin. Whereas TW3 had had a dark nightclub atmosphere, the new programme used predominantly white sets. The theme tune was sung by Lynda Baron. The programme lacked the impact of TW3 and lasted only one series before being replaced by the Robert Robinson-fronted BBC-3 (which aired once a week).

She is the author of the books In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power and The Support Economy: Why Corporations Are Failing Individuals and the Next Episode of Capitalism, co- authored with James Maxmin. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power, integrates her lifelong themes: the digital revolution, the evolution of capitalism, the historical emergence of psychological individuality, and the conditions for human development. Zuboff's work is the source of many original concepts including 'surveillance capitalism', 'instrumentarian power', 'the division of learning in society', 'economies of action', 'the means of behavior modification', 'information civilization', 'computer-mediated work', the 'automate/informate' dialectic, 'abstraction of work' and 'individualization of consumption'.  Education  Zuboff received her B.A. in philosophy from the University of Chicago, and her Ph.D. in social psychology from Harvard University.  Career  Zuboff joined the Harvard Business School in 1981 where she became the Charles Edward Wilson Professor of Business Administration and one of the first tenured women on the Harvard Business School faculty. In 2014 and 2015 she was a Faculty Associate at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at the Harvard Law School.  Surveillance capitalism  Zuboff's new work explores a novel market form and a specific logic of capitalist accumulation that she named \\"surveillance capitalism\\". She first presented her concept in a 2014 essay, \\"A Digital Declaration\\", published in German and English in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Her followup 2015 scholarly article in the Journal of Information Technology titled \\"Big Other: Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information Civilization\\" received the International Conference on Information Systems Scholars' 2016 Best Paper Award. Surveillance capitalism and its consequences for twenty-first century society are most fully theorized in her book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power. Zuboff's scholarship on surveillance capitalism as a \\"rogue mutation of capitalism\\" has become a primary framework for understanding big data and the larger field of commercial surveillance that she describes as a \\"surveillance-based economic order\\". She argues that neither privacy nor antitrust laws provide adequate protection from the unprecedented practices of surveillance capitalism. Zuboff describes surveillance capitalism as an economic and social logic. Her book originates the concept of 'instrumentarian power', in contrast to totalitarian power. Instrumentarian power is a consequence of surveillance capitalist operations that threaten individual autonomy and democracy. Many issues that plague contemporary society including the assault on privacy and the so-called 'privacy paradox', behavioral targeting, fake news, ubiquitous tracking, legislative and regulatory failure, algorithmic governance, social media addiction, abrogation of human rights, democratic destabilization, and more are reinterpreted and explained through the lens of surveillance capitalism's economic and social imperatives. Earlier work= In the Age of the Smart Machine  Zuboff's 1988 book, In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power, is a study of information technology in the workplace.Avgerou, Chrisanthi, Claudio Ciborra, and Frank Land. ‚ÄúIntroduction.‚Äù The Social Study of Information and Communication Technology: Innovation, Actors and Contexts.

The Social Study of Information and Communication Technology: Innovation, Actors and Contexts. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2004. Print. Major concepts introduced in this book relate to knowledge, authority, and power in the information workplace. These include the duality of information technology as an informating and an automating technology; the abstraction of work associated with information technology and its related intellectual skill demands; computer-mediated work; the \\"information panopticon\\"; information technology as a challenge to managerial authority and command/control; the social construction of technology; the shift from a division of labor to a division of learning; and the inherently collaborative patterns of information work, among others. The Support Economy The Support Economy: Why Corporations Are Failing Individuals and the Next Episode of Capitalism, co-authored with James Maxmin, was the product of multi-disciplinary research integrating history, sociology, management and economics. It argued that the new structure of demand associated with the 'individuation of consumption' had produced widespread institutional failures in every domain, including a growing divide between the individuals and the commercial organizations upon which they depend. Written before the introduction of the iPod or the widespread penetration of the Internet, Zuboff and Maxmin argued that wealth creation in an individualized society would require leveraging new digital capabilities to enable a 'distributed capitalism'. This entails a shift away from a primary focus on economies of scale, asset intensification, concentration, central control, and anonymous transactions in 'organization-space' towards support-oriented relationships in 'individual-space' with products and services configured and distributed to meet individualized wants and needs.  Other work =Odyssey In 1993, Zuboff founded the executive education program ‚ÄúOdyssey: School for the Second Half of Life‚Äù at the Harvard Business School. The program addressed the issues of transformation and career renewal at midlife. During twelve years of her teaching and leadership, Odyssey became known as the premier program of its kind in the world.  Non-academic work  In addition to her academic work, Zuboff brought her ideas to many commercial and public/private ventures through her public speaking as well as her direct involvement in key projects, particularly in social housing, health care, education, and elder care. She also became a business columnist, developing and disseminating new concepts from The Support Economy. From 2003 to 2005, Zuboff shared her ideas in her widely read monthly column ‚ÄúEvolving‚Äù, in the magazine Fast Company. From 2007 through 2009 she was a featured columnist for Business Week. From 2013 to 2016, Zuboff was a frequent contributor to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, where essays drawn from her emerging work on surveillance capitalism were published in German and English. In 2019 Zuboff further developed her critique of the social, political and economic impacts of digital technologies in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism. On 25 September 2020, Zuboff was named as one of the 25 members of the \\"Real Facebook Oversight Board\\", an independent monitoring group over Facebook.https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech- news/facebook-real-oversight-board-n1240958 Books *In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power (1988) *The Support Economy: Why Corporations Are Failing Individuals and the Next Episode of Capitalism (2002) *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power (Campus, 2018; PublicAffairs, 2019) References External links  * * Category:American sociologists Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Harvard University alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Living people Category:Internet theorists Category:1951 births ","title":"Shoshana Zuboff"},{"id":"10113018","text":"Robert M.

However, in 1958 he resigned his post as military attach√© to the United States to join the separatist Permesta movement where he encountered Kopassus as his opponent. His involvement in Permesta damaged his promising military career, but he remained popular and active in the armed forces community. Early life Kawilarang was born in Batavia (now known as Jakarta) on 23 February 1920.Simatupang (1972), p. 126. His father, Alexander Herman Hermanus Kawilarang, was a major in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL or Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger).Matanasi (2011), p. 46. His mother was Nelly Betsy Mogot.Ramadhan KH (1988), p. 13. Both parents were from the Minahasa region in North Sulawesi. Kawilarang enjoyed comprehensive European education-style that included attending the Dutch secondary school (HBS or Hogere burgerschool (nl)) in Bandung.Ramadhan KH (1988), p. 14. Around 1940, he attended the Dutch military academy or Koninklijke Militaire Academie that was moved to Bandung, because of the German occupation of the Netherlands. His classmates included A. H. Nasution and T. B. Simatupang.Anderson (1972), p. 234. After graduating from the academy, he was stationed in Magelang as platoon commander and assigned back to Bandung as an instructor.Ramadhan KH (1988), pp. 16, 17. During the Japanese occupation, Manadonese, Ambonese, and Indo people were often randomly arrested during raids due to their perceived closeness to the Dutch. Many were severely tortured by the Kempeitai. Kawilarang was tortured several times by the Japanese in 1943 and 1944. He survived, but suffered lifelong disability in his right arm and numerous scars.Ramadhan KH (1988), p. 25. Kawilarang recalls: \\"Someone in the warung [food stall] said: 'Japan will grant the Indonesian people its freedom.' I could not ascribe any sense at all to such small talk. Impossible! That was my opinion. But I remained silent. I didn't feel much for more torture ... A news paper wrote: 'Japan is an old friend.' Lies! I thought.Kawilarang (1994), p. 23. Kawilarang slowly developed an appreciation for the rhetoric of the charismatic Indonesian nationalist Sukarno and became strongly convinced that the time for an independent Indonesian state had arrived. In 1944, Kawilarang's father was presumed killed while he was a POW on the Japanese cargo ship Junyo Maru (see his father's Japanese detention card at the Dutch National Archives website). The ship was carrying 3,000 Menadonese, Ambonese, Indo-European, Dutch, British, Australian, American POW's, and over 3,500 Javanese Romusha when it was sunk by the British submarine HMS Tradewind. Kawilarang recalls being told about the tragedy: \\"I prayed in silence. I did not cry. The Japanese had given me enough practice in digesting pain and suffering in silence.\\"Kawilarang (1994), p. 28 For the remainder of the war, Kawilarang worked in several private capacities in Sumatra, the last of which was as chief of a rubber factory in Tanjung Karang (now Bandar Lampung) in South Sumatra.Simatupang (1972), p. 126.Anderson (1972), p. 425. Indonesian National Revolution Kawilarang (second from left) accepting transfer of sovereignty in Tapanuli After the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, Kawilarang returned to Jakarta and enlisted in the newly formed Indonesian army. In October 1945, he was assigned to the staff of the First Command of West Java or Komandemen I Jawa Barat in Purwakarta and given the rank of Major.Anwar (2004), p. 253. In January 1946, he became Chief of Staff of the Bogor Infantry Regiment of the Second Division.Ramadhan KH (1988), p. 61. In August 1946, he became the commander of the Second Brigade (\\"Surya Kencana\\") of the newly formed Siliwangi Division and was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.Ramadhan KH (1988), p. 93.Gayantari (2007), p. 30. He was in command of the brigade during Operation Product, which was the first Dutch military aggression against the Republic of Indonesia. He also commanded the First Brigade for a brief period when the brigade was transferred to Yogyakarta.Simatupang (1972), p. 126. In mid-1948, Kawilarang was included in a contingent of government and military officials to Bukittinggi in West Sumatra. The move was in anticipation of a second Dutch military aggression and to allow the formation of an Indonesian emergency government outside of Java. Kawilarang was assigned to lead the Seventh Sub-Territorial Command (or Komando Sub-Teritorial VII) for Tapanuli and the southern region of East Sumatra. One of his tasks was to stop the infighting between factions of the army in the area.Abin (2016), pp. 149, 150. When the Indonesian government-in- exile was enacted because of Operation Kraai (the second Dutch military aggression against Indonesia), Kawilarang was also appointed as Deputy Military Governor of the same region in Sumatra with Ferdinand Lumbantobing appointed as Military Governor.Simatupang (1972), p. 238.Suprayitno (2011), p. 96. In December 1949, Kawilarang was appointed as Territorial Commander of North Sumatra (or Komando Teritorium/Sumatra Utara, now Kodam I/Bukit Barisan) in anticipation of the Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty after the Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference.Ramadhan KH (1988), p. 176. During his career, Kawilarang was also territorial commander of two other important military districts: Military Territory VII / East Indonesia (or Tentara dan Teritorium (TT) VII/Indonesia Timur, now Kodam XIV/Hasanuddin) in April 1950 and Military Territory III / West Java (or Tentara dan Teritorium (TT) III/Jawa Barat, now Kodam III/Siliwangi) in November 1951.Indonesia (April 1983), pp. 114, 118 Expeditionary force to East Indonesia Kawilarang (middle) and Suharto (right) Kawilarang (left) and Slamet Rijadi discussing strategy in Ambon Having just turned 30 and already promoted to Colonel, Kawilarang was given command of the first post-independence expeditionary force in April 1950.Conboy (2003), p. 8. He was ordered to quell a revolt by a company of former KNIL that including Andi Aziz and Dutch army soldiers or Koninklijke Leger in Makassar, South Sulawesi. The expeditionary force consisted of several brigades, including those that were led by Suharto (the second president of Indonesia) and Joop Warouw.van Dijk (1981), p. 165. On 8 August 1950, fighting ceased after negotiations between Kawilarang and Dutch General Scheffelaar.Royal Institute of International Affairs (1950), p. 538. Regarding Kawilarang's relationship with Suharto during the expedition, Kawilarang is said to have struck Suharto due to a blunder by the troops commanded by Suharto. In at least one interview with Kawilarang, he denied striking Suharto, but did state that he had to admonish him.Jenkins (1984), p. 200. Around the same time of the military operation in Makassar, Kawilarang also organized forces against the separatist RMS movement in the Moluccas. The fighting was more ferocious, because the opposition were well-trained Mollucan former KNIL soldiers including the Green Caps.Conboy (2003), pp. 6, 9. Although better trained and renowned for their fighting skills, the resistance of the Mollucan soldiers was eventually put down in November 1950. Let. Col. Slamet Riyadi who was the commander of the government forces in the Maluku sector and an important participant during the offensive was killed on the final day of the campaign.Conboy (2003), p. 10. Kopassus The military engagements in Maluku prompted Kawilarang to establish what would later become Indonesia's special forces Kopassus.Conboy (2003), p. 16. Some acknowledge that the idea of a specialized commando unit was the brainchild of both Kawilarang and Riyadi.TEMPO (2002), p. 20.Sebastian (2006), p. 172. On 15 April 1952, Kawilarang founded the Third Territorial Army Commando Unit or Kesatuan Komando Tentara Territorium III (Kesko TT) when he was territorial commander of Military Territory III in Bandung.Kingsbury (2003), p. 94. He asked Moch. Idjon Djanbi, a former KNIL commando, to train the unit.Conboy (2003), p. 19. In 1999, a year before his death, Kawilarang became an honorary member of Kopassus and received a red beret during a ceremony commemorating the 47th anniversary of the establishment of Kopassus.Kompas (8 June 2000). Military attach√© to the US In August 1956, Maj. Gen. Nasution as Chief of Staff of the Army appointed Kawilarang to the post of Military Attach√© to the United States.Vey (April 1971), p. 161. It has been argued that the purpose of the appointment was to remove Kawilarang from the influential post of commander of Military Territory III / West Java and replace him with an officer who was less of a threat or even pro-Nasution.Vey (April 1971), p. 161.Kahin (1995), p. 51.Hill (2010), pp. 47, 49. A similar move by Nasution was to replace commander of the East Indonesia Military Territory from Joop Warouw to Ventje Sumual.Vey (April 1971), p. 160.Morrison (1999), p. 9. Just a day before the transfer ceremony, Kawilarang ordered the arrest of the Foreign Minister Ruslan Abdulgani due to his alleged corrupt activities.van der Kroef (April 1957), p. 49. This move was backed by Zulkifli Lubis, an opponent of Nasution.Hill (2010), p. 47. Nasution rescinded Kawilarang's order and Abdulgani was released.Vey (April 1971), p. 162. Regarding the appointment to Washington, Kawilarang himself stated that the position was offered by Nasution, because Kawilarang had wanted to obtain more military knowledge outside the country.Ramadhan KH (1988), p. 285. Permesta Because of continued grievances toward the central government in Java due to, among other things, the lack of regional autonomy, on 2 March 1957, Ventje Sumual declared the Universal Struggle Charter or Piagam Perjuangan Semesta (Permesta).Harvey (2009), p. 15. The movement's center was Manado and Minahasa in North Sulawesi where Kawilarang was from. The movement allied itself with a separate movement based in Sumatra called the \\"Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia\\" or Pemerintah Revolusioner Republik Indonesia (PRRI). Kawilarang had been monitoring the situation from Washington and had concluded that the central government in Java and its mismanagement was to blame for the regional crisis.Harvey (2009), p. 103 In March 1958, he informed the Indonesian ambassador to the US, Murkoto, that he would be leaving for North Sulawesi.Ramadhan KH (1988), p. 292. He left his post on 22 March 1958.van der Kroef (May 1958), p. 77. Kawilarang was the only army officer who was not immediately dishonorably discharged for their participation in Permesta and PRRI.Lev (1966), pp. 54-55. He had not fully accepted the PRRI side of the movement that he thought was aligned to religious extremists, and Jakarta had thus hoped that he would change his mind.Conboy (2003), pp. 50-51.Harvey (2009), p. 123 Although he declined the position of Commander-in-chief of all PRRI-Permesta forces, he remained with Permesta and became Commander of the Permesta armed forces.Asnan et al. (2006), p. 140.Johnson (2015), p. 206. The rebellion lasted until 1961 when government forces managed to gain an upper hand on the Permesta troops. The government forces were under the command of many officers whom Kawilarang had previously fought on the same side with.Conboy (2003), p. 51. The conflict was concluded peacefully through the efforts of F. J. Tumbelaka. Several ceremonies took place in April and May 1961 where the Indonesian government officially accepted back the Permesta troops. Kawilarang participated in the ceremony on 14 April that was attended by the deputy commander of the Indonesian army, Maj. Gen. Hidayat, and also Brig. Gen. Achmad Yani both of whom Kawilarang knew well.Palohoon (May 2017). Later in his life, he reflected on the virtues of comradery between men at arms and nobility among officers. During post war reunions with his former Dutch classmates at the Bandung school for officers he concludes: \\"Comradery is deeply rooted in their soul. I still wonder about the comradery between our own Indonesian cadets. In times of war combat is a duty. Comradery and humanity are a whole different chapter. I am convinced our state philosophy \\"Pancasila\\" breathes the same virtue.Kawilarang (1994), p. 70. Civilian life Permesta troops including Kawilarang were given amnesty by President Sukarno on 22 June 1961.Indonesian Ministry of Home Affairs (2011), p. 21. However, due to his role in Permesta, he never received military distinctions like his contemporaries except for becoming an honorary member of Kopassus in 1999.Jenkins (1984), p. 292. Kawilarang resigned from his military position, but remained influential in the retired military society called purnawirawan and the Veterans Association or Pepabri.Jenkins (1984), p. 120. Putting his fighting years behind him, he made amends with all his former opponents and even visited The Netherlands several times for reunions with KNIL pensioners before his death in 2000. Among the business activities that Kawilarang was involved in after returning to civilian life was as deputy manager of Jakarta Racing Management that maintained the racetrack at Pulo Mas in Jakarta and organized horse racing events.Ramadhan KH (1992), p. 254. The annual national equestrian and horse racing competition is called the AE Kawilarang Memorial Cup.Bramantoro (January 2017). Death On 6 June 2000, Kawilarang died at Cipto Mangunkusomo Hospital in Jakarta. He was laid in the Soedirman Room at the Siliwangi Military District Command Headquarters in Bandung that was followed by a full military ceremony led by Maj. Gen. Slamet Supriyadi, Siliwangi Military District Commander. Kawilarang was buried in the Cikutra Heroes Cemetery in Bandung.Jakarta Post (June 2000). Personal life Kawilarang was married twice. He married Petronella Isabella van Emden on 16 October 1952.Ramadhan KH (1988), p. 272. They divorced in 1958. The couple had two children, Aisabella Nelly Kawilarang and Alexander Edwin Kawilarang. Kawilarang's second wife was Henny Olga Pondaag. They had one child, Pearl Hazel Kawilarang.Gayantari (2007), p. 32. Kawilarang's son, Edwin, is head of the purnawirawan organization FKPPI and, as such, part of the so-called Keluarga Besar Purnawirawan (KBK), which translates to English as the 'Greater Family of Ex-military'. Under the New Order or Orde Baru, he also was an official at Bimantara, a company owned by Suharto's son Bambang Trihatmodjo.Kartasasmita (2013), p. 66. Edwin was a member of the People's Consultative Assembly from 1997 to 2004, the Regional Representative Council from 2004 to 2009, and the People's Representative Council from 2009 to 2014. In each position, he represented constituents from the province of North Sulawesi.Penerbit Buku Kompas (2010), p. 185. Kawilarang's cousin, Daan Mogot, died during an attempt to disarm a Japanese army depot in Lengkong in 1946.Ramadhan KH (1988), p. 65.

Steve Miller's Band The Ardells was a band started by Steve Miller in 1961 when he attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. In the fall of 1962, Steve lived in a rooming house at 515 North Henry St. in Madison and also pledged the Chi Psi fraternity on fraternity row near Langdon St. Steve taught another fellow student, Jos Davidson, to play rhythm guitar and then bass, and formed a campus band: Steve Miller and the Ardells. Steve was featured on guitar, vocals and harp, and played a version of Texas shuffle blues that hadn't been heard in the upper Midwest. Also featured in the band were a local 16-year-old high school piano player named Brian Friedman, and Ron Boyer a drummer who worked a day job as a manager in a local Kelly's Hamburger drive in. The band played mostly the University party circuit, plus a few gigs in Madison and local clubs and a couple of concerts and the Dane County Fairgrounds. Later, Davidson joined Corky Siegel and Jim Schwall and was the bassist for the Siegel-Schwall Band from 1964 to 1967. Later, at the end of the 62-63 school year, Steve left Madison and came down to Chicago. There, Steve (vocals, guitar, bass) was accompanied by Boz Scaggs (rhythm guitar, vocals), Micheal Krusing (lead guitar, bass), Denny Berg (vocals, guitar, bass), Ron Boyer (drums), Ben Sidran (keyboards). The group performed at local clubs in Chicago's Old Town and burgeoning blues scene through 1965 and covered a variety of song styles from the 1950s and 1960s, including Texas blues, rhythm & blues and solid rock 'n' roll. Three part vocal harmony by Miller, Scaggs and Berg was their trademark and made them one of the premier groups on campus. Steve Miller went on to form the Steve Miller Band, Boz Scaggs has an extremely distinguished vocal careerBoz Scaggs - Fade Into Light - Biography and Ben Sidran became a professor of music as well as a major force in the modern day history of jazz and rock & roll.Ben Sidran - Biography #1 Micheal Krusing settled down to have a family and Ron Boyer runs The Village Green bar and tavern in Middleton, WI along with his wife and children.. Florida Band The Ardells was a band from West Palm Beach, Florida that had been together since 1959: Bill Ande, Tom Condra, Vic Gray, and Dave Hieronymus. They were originally The R-Dells (aka Ardells). In 1964, their manager ‚ÄîBob Yorey‚Äî changed their name to The American Beetles as a joke, and they toured in South America, then changed names again to The Razor's Edge in 1966 and had a hit with \\"Let's Call It a Day Girl\\" on Pow!

The Court upheld a law that prevented the publicizing of election results from some ridings before the polls closed in others. The law was later repealed by a vote in parliament in October 2015, prior to the 2015 Canadian federal election, citing the increased use of social media. Background Section 329 of the Canada Elections Act outlawed publishing election results from other ridings in constituencies where polls were still open. However, in the federal election in 2000, one Paul Charles Bryan published results from Atlantic Canada on the Internet despite being told not to by the authorities. Bryan was charged before the Provincial Court of British Columbia, but fought the charges as unconstitutional under section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects freedom of expression and freedom of association. Bryan's victory before the British Columbia Supreme Court meant that voters in British Columbia legally learned of election results in other ridings during the federal election in 2004.CBC News, \\"Supreme Court upholds blackout on early election night results,\\" March 15, 2007, URL accessed 17 March 2007. However, Bryan lost his case before the British Columbia Court of Appeal. Stephen Harper, who later became prime minister, labelled Elections Canada \\"jackasses\\" and tried to raise money for Bryan. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation also supported Bryan, hoping to \\"make election night a bigger event it already is.\\" Decision The majority of the Court produced three opinions upholding the law, one by Justice Bastarache and one by Justice Fish, with the remaining three judges writing a brief opinion of agreement. Bastarache Justice Bastarache pointed to the Supreme Court case Harper v. Canada (Attorney General) (2004), which had also considered the Canada Elections Act. The Harper decision stated that the Court should be deferential to the government with respect to election legislation,Para. 9. and that the Court should consider the context of the law, citing Thomson Newspapers Co. v. Canada (Attorney General) (1998) to say that this involves considering why someone guarded by the law is at risk and why someone would perceive oneself to be at risk.Para. 10. In this case, Bastarache found the purpose of section 329 was to promote the idea of each voter in Canada knowing as much as each other, as it may be unfair if some voters already know election results in other ridings while earlier voters do not know of any outcomes. This idea of section 329 would also build public trust in elections.Para. 12. Bastarache felt that voters aware of some results may base their own choices on that knowledge,Para. 14. and Bastarache recognized without demand for much proof that it is a principle of democracy that a person cannot base their choice in voting on special knowledge.Para. 22. In this case, Bastarache did not really emphasize the idea that Canadian voters from Western Canada were at risk of being swayed by special knowledge, saying that Canadian voters should be trusted to have some \\"maturity and intelligence.\\"Para. 24. Instead, Bastarache said what was at stake was the view that Canadian elections are fair, and pointed to polls to reinforce this idea.Para. 25. On the topic of freedom of expression, Bastarache questioned the value of spreading election results, and said that there was no evidence this could outweigh the principles of democracy of section 329.Para. 27. On whether a violation of freedom of expression could be justified under section 1 of the Charter, Bastarache found that fairness in elections should be a sufficient objective of the law,Para. 35. as should building public trust in elections.Para. 37. Additionally, banning the publishing of election results was needed to achieve this objective, and Parliament considered this to be the best method.Para. 47. Fish Justice Fish states election results from other ridings should not be published in a riding before its polls close so voters can vote without knowing how other voters have voted.Para. 54-55. Fish says section 329 of the Canada Elections Act does violate section 2(b) of the Charter of Rights for a short while,Para. 57. but section 329 is constitutional because it \\"relates to a pressing and substantial concern in a free and democratic society\\",Para. 61. thus satisfying one part of section 1 of the Charter which can limit the rights of Canadians. Section 329 is also constitutional because according to Fish, the court is dealing with \\"an important element of Canada‚Äôs electoral system\\"Para. 63. so section 1 of the Charter of Rights can be invoked. Fish refers to both a Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing publicationPara. 70. and a 2005 joint Decima Research-Carleton University Poll;Para. 72. both state Canadians do not want to know election results before their polls close. Fish believes even if there is no harm in releasing results early, the information release would create a \\"perception\\" of unfairness, which in itself is a problem.Para. 78. Dissent Per McLachlin C.J. and Binnie, LeBel and Abella JJ: The s 329 publication ban is an excessive response to an insufficiently proven harm and a violation of s 2(b) of the Charter that cannot be justified under s 1. The government's s 1 justification falters fatally in its submission that the benefits of the limitation on the freedom of expression are proportional to its harmful effects. Here, when the harm at which the blackout period in s 329 is aimed is considered in the context of staggered hours, there is only speculative and unpersuasive evidence to support the government's claim that the information imbalance is of sufficient harm to voter behaviour or perceptions of electoral unfairness that it outweighs any damage done to a fundamental and constitutional protected right.

Broadly speaking, a quantum radar can be seen as a device working in the microwave range, which exploits quantum features, from the point of view of the radiation source and/or the output detection, and is able to outperform a classical counterpart. One approach is based on the use of input quantum correlations (in particular, quantum entanglement) combined with a suitable interferometric quantum detection at the receiver (strongly related to the protocol of quantum illumination). Paving the way for a technologically-viable prototype of a quantum radar involves the resolution of a number of experimental challenges as discussed in some review articles, the latter of which pointed out \\"inaccurate reporting\\" in the media. Current experimental designs seem to be limited to very short ranges, of the order of one meter, suggesting that potential applications might instead be for near-distance surveillance or biomedical scanning. Concept behind a microwave-range model A microwave-range model of a quantum radar was proposed in 2015 by an international team and is based on the protocol of Gaussian quantum illumination. The basic concept is to create a stream of entangled visible- frequency photons and split it in half. One half, the \\"signal beam\\", goes through a conversion to microwave frequencies in a way that preserves the original quantum state. The microwave signal is then sent and received as in a normal radar system. When the reflected signal is received it is converted back into visible photons and compared with the other half of the original entangled beam, the \\"idler beam\\". Although most of the original entanglement will be lost due to quantum decoherence as the microwaves travel to the target objects and back, enough quantum correlations will still remain between the reflected-signal and the idler beams. Using a suitable quantum detection scheme, the system can pick out just those photons that were originally sent by the radar, completely filtering out any other sources. If the system can be made to work in the field, it represents an enormous advance in detection capability. One way to defeat conventional radar systems is to broadcast signals on the same frequencies used by the radar, making it impossible for the receiver to distinguish between their own broadcasts and the spoofing signal (or \\"jamming\\"). However, such systems cannot know, even in theory, what the original quantum state of the radar's internal signal was. Lacking such information, their broadcasts will not match the original signal and will be filtered out in the correlator. Environmental sources, like ground clutter and aurora, will similarly be filtered out. History One of the first designs for a quantum radar was proposed by Edward H. Allen in 2005 when employed by defense contractor Lockheed Martin. The patent on this work was granted in 2013. The aim was to create a radar system providing a better resolution and higher detail than classical radar could provide.Marco Lanzagorta, Quantum Radar, Morgan & Claypool (2011). In 2015, another model was proposed by an international team of researchers, demonstrating a theoretical advantage over a classical setup. In this model of quantum radar, one considers the remote sensing of a low-reflectivity target that is embedded within a bright microwave background, with detection performance well beyond the capability of a classical microwave radar. By using a suitable wavelength \\"electro- optomechanical converter\\", this scheme generates excellent quantum entanglement between a microwave signal beam, sent to probe the target region, and an optical idler beam, retained for detection. The microwave return collected from the target region is subsequently converted into an optical beam and then measured jointly with the idler beam. Such a technique extends the powerful protocol of quantum illumination to its more natural spectral domain, namely microwave wavelengths. In 2019, a three-dimensional enhancement quantum radar protocol was proposed. It could be understood as a quantum metrology protocol for the localization of a non-cooperative point-like target in three-dimensional space. It employed quantum entanglement to achieve an uncertainty in localization that is quadratically smaller for each spatial direction than what could be achieved by using independent, unentangled photons. Review articles that delve more into the history and designs of quantum radar, in addition to the ones mentioned in the introduction above, are available on the arXiv. A quantum radar is challenging to be realized with current technology, even though a preliminary experimental prototype has been realized. Challenges and limitations There are a number of non-trivial challenges behind the experimental implementation of a truly-quantum radar prototype, even at short ranges. According to current quantum illumination designs, an important point is the management of the idler pulse that, ideally, should be jointly detected together with the signal pulse returning from the potential target. However, this would require the use of a quantum memory with a long coherence time, able to work at times comparable with the round-trip of the signal pulse. Other solutions may degrade too much the quantum correlations between signal and idler pulses to a point where the quantum advantage may disappear. This is a problem that also affects optical designs of quantum illumination. For instance, storing the idler pulse in a delay line by using a standard optical fiber would degrade the system and limit the maximum range of a quantum illumination radar to about 11 km. This value has to be interpreted as a theoretical limit of this design, not to be confused with an achievable range. Other limitations include the fact that current quantum designs only consider a single polarization, azimuth, elevation, range, Doppler bin at a time. Media speculation about applications There is media speculation that a quantum radar could operate at long ranges detecting stealth aircraft, filter out deliberate jamming attempts, and operate in areas of high background noise, e.g., due to ground clutter. Related to the above, there is considerable media speculation of the use of quantum radar as a potential anti-stealth technology. Stealth aircraft are designed to reflect signals away from the radar, typically by using rounded surfaces and avoiding anything that might form a partial corner reflector. This so reduces the amount of signal returned to the radar's receiver that the target is (ideally) lost in the thermal background noise. Although stealth technologies will still be just as effective at reflecting the original signal away from the receiver of a quantum radar, it is the system's ability to separate out the remaining tiny signal, even when swamped by other sources, that allows it to pick out the return even from highly stealthy designs. At the moment these long-range applications are speculative and not supported by experimental data. According to Chinese state media, the first quantum radar was developed and tested by China in real-world environment in August 2016. More recently, the generation of large numbers of entangled photons for radar detection has been studied by the University of Waterloo.

It was over three times as heavy (without pilot) as the Gossamer Penguin and had a shorter wingspan, but was proportionately more powerful, with electricity supplied by 16,128 solar cells powering two three-horsepower motors. The solar panels were directly affixed to the wing and large horizontal stabilizer, both of which had to be flat on top to accommodate them. The two motors, each 3 inches wide and 17 inches long and incorporating samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, operated in tandem on a common shaft to drive a single, controllable-pitch propeller.

Early life  Aitcheson's father, Joe Sr., who went by his middle name Leiter, also pitched for the Baltimore Orioles in the minor leagues and the Brooklyn Dodgers in the majors, helped his brother Whitney found the Iron Bridge Hounds, serving as its Master of Foxhounds for many years. Introduced to the saddle at age 3, Aitcheson later worked weekends at his uncle Whitney's riding stables, cleaning barns and guiding trail rides. After high school, he enrolled at the University of Maryland, lasting one semester. Aitcheson enlisted in the United States Navy, serving four years during the Korean War as a gunner‚Äôs mate on the aircraft carrier USS Oriskany. Upon his discharge, Aitcheson returned to Maryland and applied for his professional steeplechase jockey's license.  Racing career  Aitcheson retired as the winningest steeplechase jockey in history, posting 440 jump wins from 2,457 mounts over a career spanning more than two decades, exceeding the next highest career total by almost ten percent (42 more than Alfred P. \\"Paddy\\" Smithwick.) In addition, Aitcheson holds the single season jump wins record of 40. Aitcheson won eight Virginia Gold Cups, seven Carolina Cups, and six International Gold Cups, also clinching five Temple Gwathmeys, five Noel Laings, five Midsummers and five Manlys. The National Steeplechase Association has maintained, since 1956, a list of annual leading jockeys by races won. Aitcheson has won more titles than any other jockey, 7.

Doug Small and Tommy Walsh upended his reign in 1965 and 1966, respectively, but Aitcheson took four consecutive titles between 1967 through 1970. Aitcheson rode many of his era's national champions including Peal (1961), Amber Diver (1963), Bon Nouvel (1964, 1965, 1968), Tuscalee (1966), Top Bid (1970) and Soothsayer (1972). In 1976, he became the only professional jockey to receive the National Steeplechase Association's F. Ambrose Clark Award for lifetime service to the sport. Aitcheson was named the Maryland Horse Council's Horseman of the Year for 2006. He was inducted in the Hall of Fame in 1978.

Usually, flank speed is reserved for situations in which a ship finds itself in imminent danger, such as coming under attack by aircraft. Flank speed is very demanding of fuel and often unsustainable because of propulsion system limitations. The related term emergency may not be any faster than flank but it indicates that the ship should be brought up to maximum speed in the shortest possible time. Other speeds include one-third, two-thirds, standard and full. One-third and two- thirds are the respective fractions of standard speed. Full is greater than standard but not as great as flank. In surface ship nuclear marine propulsion, the difference between full speed and flank speed is of lesser significance, because vessels can be run at or very near their true maximum speed for a long time with little regard for fuel expended, an important consideration for oil fuelled ships. In US nuclear submarine propulsion, full speed is 50 percent reactor power. Flank speed is 100 percent power, although limits may be reached for the propulsion turbine first stage pressure or for reactor thermal power (in MW) (depending upon the specifics of the individual propulsion plant) before 100 percent reactor power is reached. For flank speed, the reactor's main coolant pumps must also be shifted into fast speed. \\"Flank speed\\" is exclusively an American phrase and as such is unknown in Commonwealth (\\"White Ensign\\") navies. The Commonwealth navies use the following telegraph commands: # Slow ahead/astern, the number of revolutions is standardized for the individual ship and is unstated # Half ahead/astern, accompanied by an order for a power setting (e.g., \\"half ahead both engines, revolutions 1,500\\") # Full speed ahead/astern. This is reserved for emergencies and as such the word \\"speed\\" is included to distinguish it from the other commands mentioned.

Levin and Xiao-Gang Wen. A particular string-net model may involve only closed loops; or networks of oriented, labeled strings obeying branching rules given by some gauge group; or still more general networks. Overview The string-net model is claimed to show the derivation of photons, electrons, and U(1) gauge charge, small (relative to the Planck mass) but nonzero masses, and suggestions that the leptons, quarks, and gluons can be modeled in the same way. In other words, string-net condensation provides a unified origin for photons and electrons (or gauge bosons and fermions). It can be viewed as an origin of light and electron (or gauge interactions and Fermi statistics). However, their model does not account for the chiral coupling between the fermions and the SU(2) gauge bosons in the standard model. For strings labeled by the positive integers, string-nets are the spin networks studied in loop quantum gravity. This has led to the proposal by Levin and Wen, and Smolin, Markopoulou and Konopka that loop quantum gravity's spin networks can give rise to the standard model of particle physics through this mechanism, along with fermi statistics and gauge interactions. To date, a rigorous derivation from LQG's spin networks to Levin and Wen's spin lattice has yet to be done, but the project to do so is called quantum graphity, and in a more recent paper, Tomasz Konopka, Fotini Markopoulou, Simone Severini argued that there are some similarities to spin networks (but not necessarily an exact equivalence) that gives rise to U(1) gauge charge and electrons in the string net mechanism. Herbertsmithite may be an example of string-net matter. Examples=Z2 spin liquid Z2 spin liquid obtained using slave- particle approach may be the first theoretical example of string-net liquid.Xiao-Gang Wen, Mean Field Theory of Spin Liquid States with Finite Energy Gaps and Topological Orders, Phys. Rev. B44, 2664 (1991). The toric code The toric code is a two dimensional spin lattice that acts as a quantum error-correcting code. It is defined on a two dimensional lattice with toric boundary conditions with a spin-1/2 on each link. It can be shown that the ground state of the standard toric code Hamiltonian is an equal weight superposition of closed string states. Such a ground state is an example of a string-net condensate which has the same topological order as the Z2 spin liquid above.

He was promoted Captain 20 August 1919 and retired on 5 October 1922.April 1921 Indian Army List From 1925 to 1944, he worked for the administrative service of the northern provinces of Nigeria. He researched the local languages, and assisted George Percival Bargery to compile the latter's monumental and authoritative Hausa- English Dictionary, published in 1934.George P. Bargery, A Hausa-English Dictionary and English-Hausa Vocabulary. London: Oxford University Press, 1934. 1226p. In his Principles of Hausa (1934), Abraham simplified Bargery's six-tone system to the correct three-tone system for Hausa. In this period, he also published The Grammar of Tiv (1933) and The Principles of Idoma (1935), the first detailed linguistic description of an eastern Kwa language. Abraham's grammars and dictionaries represented major descriptive and analytical contributions to the study of African languages. In 1941-2, he taught Hausa to soldiers in the Royal West African frontier force. Later in World War II, he served in Ethiopia, teaching Amharic and Somali; he was also based in Kenya, South Africa, France, and Italy, and with the British military mission in Moscow, being promoted to major. In 1945, Abraham was awarded a Leverhulme research fellowship to research the languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea (including Amharic and Ge'ez). In 1946 he failed to succeed Bargery as lecturer in Hausa at the School of Oriental and African Studies. However, in 1948 he was appointed to a new lectureship in Amharic; he also taught Tigrinya and began research into Berber, Oromo, and Somali. His Dictionary of Hausa was published in 1949 and The Principles of Somali in 1951. He retired in 1951. In 1952, Abraham embarked on a study of Yoruba. His Dictionary of Modern Yoruba appeared in 1958. A commemorative volume in honour of his outstanding contribution to the understanding of African languages was published in 1992.

X PRIZE  The Ansari X PRIZE was a space competition in which the X PRIZE Foundation offered a US$10,000,000 prize for the first non-government organization to launch a reusable human spacecraft into space twice within two weeks. It was modeled after early 20th-century aviation prizes, and aimed to spur development of low-cost spaceflight. The prize was won on October 4, 2004, the 47th anniversary of the Sputnik 1 launch, by the Tier One project designed by Burt Rutan and financed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, using the experimental spaceplane SpaceShipOne. $10 million was awarded to the winner, but more than $100 million was invested in new technologies in pursuit of the prize.  Google Lunar X Prize  Google Lunar X Prize calls for teams to compete in successfully launching, landing, and operating a rover on the lunar surface. The prize awards US$20 million to the first team to land a rover on the moon that successfully roves more than 500 meters and transmits back high definition images and video. There is a $5 million second prize, as well as $5 million in potential bonus prizes for extra features such as roving long distances (greater than 5,000 meters), capturing images of man made objects on the moon, detecting ice on one of the Moon's craters, or surviving a lunar night. The X Prize offers the first prize until December 31, 2012, thereafter it offers $15 million until December 31, 2014. America's Space Prize America's Space Prize is a US$50 million orbital spaceflight competition established and funded by hotel entrepreneur Robert Bigelow. The prize would have been awarded to the first US-based privately funded team to design and build a reusable manned capsule capable of flying 5 astronauts to a Bigelow Aerospace inflatable space module. The prize expired January 10, 2010. There must be two flights within 60 days. The teams must be based in the United States. Other, sub-million dollar prizes In addition, there are several minor space competitions, with prizes being less than one million dollars or its equivalent.  Centennial Challenges  Seeking to continue this incentive-based approach, in 2006 the X PRIZE Foundation organized the Wirefly X PRIZE Cup at Las Cruces International Airport in New Mexico. Cash awards were offered in three areas as part of the NASA Centennial Challenges Program: the Beam Power Challenge, the Tether Challenge, and the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge. Although no contestants fulfilled the criteria necessary to win any of the three challenges, the competition elicited promising technology developments and demonstrated their potential to the general public. Subsequent annual X PRIZE Cups are planned to encourage further innovation in the personal spaceflight industry, and are expected to feature cash prizes for vehicle developers who achieve milestones such as fastest launch turnaround time, maximum altitude, and fastest speed record. N-Prize The challenge posed by the N-Prize is to launch a satellite weighing between 9.99 and 19.99 grams into Earth orbit, and to track it for a minimum of nine orbits. Most importantly, though, the launch budget must be within ¬£999.99 (about $2000) - and must include all of the required non-reusable hardware and fuels.

Designed by architect Edward Elliot and constructed for the City of Halifax between 1887 and 1890, it is one of the oldest and largest public buildings in Nova Scotia. The property was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1997. Halifax City Hall was opened to Council and the public in 1890 replacing offices in the old court house on the Halifax waterfront. City Hall was chosen to become the seat of the newly created Halifax Regional Municipality in 1996 and is now home to Halifax Regional Council as well as various municipal offices. History Halifax City Hall seen from Barrington Street. The building fronts Duke Street and is located at the north end of Grand Parade, an historic military parade square dating from the founding of Halifax in 1749. Dalhousie University was situated on the present-day site of the building during the nineteenth century; for many years, the town and later city council argued for the public use of the site. A compromise was engineered by the premier, Sir William Young to facilitate a new use for the site. The provincial government provided funding for the university to relocate its facilities and the City of Halifax granted the university a parcel of land elsewhere in the city to permit the university to expand. The university building was demolished to make way for the new structure and timbers from the old academic building were reportedly incorporated into the municipal building. Design Designed by Edward Elliot and constructed for the City of Halifax between 1887 and 1890; it is one of the oldest and largest public buildings in Nova Scotia and is a designated National Historic Site of Canada. In 1981, it was also listed as a Municipally Registered Property under Nova Scotia's Heritage Property Act. Designed in an eclectic, monumental style, the building is of cream and red sandstone, laid in the freestone technique. It also features granite construction on the ground floor and in the tower. The seven-storey tower has clock faces on the north and south sides. The northern face (visible in the photograph above left), is fixed at four minutes past nine to commemorate the Halifax Explosion of 1917. The early years: 1890 to 1900 City Hall had five primary entrances in 1890. The grand entrance off of Grand Parade was the main public entrance and brought visitors onto the second floor. There were also entrances off of Argyle Street to the second floor, as well as three entrances to the first floor. One door allowed access to the building from the dry moat between the building and Grand Parade. Two doors facing Duke Street provided access to the police station that was located in the first floor until the late 1940s. Horsemen on the Grand Parade, 1887. The first floor originally contained the police court, policemen's rooms, office of Chief of Police, and jail cells. It was from these jail cells that Harry Houdini escaped in 1896, just six years after City Hall opened. The main or second floor contained the auditor's office, the Board of Works, the City Clerk, the office of the Mayor, the Collector, the City Engineer, and the Treasurer. The third floor was home to the Council Chamber and the Citizens Free Library, as well as the offices of the Inspector of Licenses, the Collector of Rents and Licenses, the Foreman of Streets, and the Foreman of Water Works. The fourth floor held a caretaker's apartment, and a space variously described as a ball room, a gallery, and a museum, though the space may simply not have been completed when the building was opened. 1900 to 1996 City Council and Department Heads, 1903. Composite photo by Notman Studio. In 1907 stables were constructed under the north-east corner of the Grand Parade, at Barrington Street next to the dry moat. This involved the installation of one regular size door and a larger door for horses and carts in the two northernmost granite arched bays, opening onto Barrington Street. After the Halifax Explosion, Deputy Mayor Colwell, five aldermen, and twelve citizens, including Lieutenant-Governor MacCallum Grant and Justice Harris, assembled in the City Collector's Office, which was the only room still serviceable after the explosion. An emergency joint meeting of the Members of the City Council present and Citizens in attendance was chaired by the Lieutenant-Governor, and would continue to meet there from December 1917 to late February 1918. On May 25, 1918 a riot broke out in downtown Halifax following the arrest of an unruly and drunken sailor. Besides a besieged City Hall, the damage included a couple of turned over cars, and a police wagon and police motorcycle being thrown in the harbour. The Citizens' Free Library was moved from place to place in the city for many years until 1890 when it was given a permanent home on the second floor of the then new City Hall. The Library closed in 1949 reopening as a part of the new Halifax Memorial Library on Spring Garden Road at Grafton Street in 1950, though the collection moved in 2014 to Halifax Central Library.The Halifax Literary Walking Tour, Stop No. 10: Citizens‚Äô Free Library, Halifax Public Libraries.

Accessed May 24, 2015 The police department remained on Brunswick Street until moving to their current location in the David R. McKinnon Building on Gottingen Street in the 1970s. A citizen committee was convened to lead a substantial renovation of the building in the 1980s. Halifax Hall, a large public meeting room, was created out of a number of offices in the east wing of the second floor. A damaging coating was applied to the sandstone in the 1990s.

During the late 1990s, Halifax Regional Council attempted to have the building renamed from Halifax City Hall to Halifax Regional Hall, to reflect the fact that Nova Scotia no longer has any \\"cities\\". This proposal was promptly rejected after a public outcry among heritage advocates. In 2011 a major multi-year restoration of the building began. The original cornerstone of the building and several other stone facade features were painstakingly restored, while up to 80% of the exterior stone was replaced with new sandstone. The roof was replaced, heating and cooling systems upgraded and the 110-year-old elevator shaft decommissioned and replaced with a new, full size elevator. Interior upgrades were undertaken to bring the public and office spaces up to modern standards while respecting and maintaining character defining heritage elements. Current use Council Chambers, Halifax City HallCouncil Chambers underwent a major upgrade in 2012. The renovation was driven in part to accommodate the newly downsized 16 member Regional Council, reduced from 23.

Plot introduction A group of authors and publishers hires Nero Wolfe to investigate a series of plagiarism claims. Wolfe, by his own admission, bungles the investigation so badly that three murders result. In Plot It Yourself, Stout draws on his lengthy experience with book publishers, with authors (via, for example, his presidency of the Authors Guild), and with the writing process itself. Apart from the series' continuing characters, all the players in the book are directly associated with the publishing industry. Stout adds as subtext his take on the peculiar relationship between book authors and book publishers ‚Äî part symbiosis, part animosity. Stout himself experienced at least one instance of contentious relations with his publishers.A Right to Die, Bantam Crimeline edition, back matter titled \\"The World of Rex Stout\\" Plot summary Someone has been getting away with a different spin on plagiarism. It's the old scam ‚Äì an unsuccessful author stealing ideas from an established source ‚Äì but it's being worked differently. Now, the plagiarists are claiming that the well-known authors are stealing from them (as Wolfe puts it, \\"plagiarism upside down.\\"Plot It Yourself, chapter 2). And they are making their claims stick: three successful claims in four years, one awaiting trial, and one that's just been made. These claims have damaged both the publishers and the authors. The Book Publishers of America (BPA) and the National Association of Authors and Dramatists (NAAD) form a joint committee to explore ways to stop the fraud, and the committee comes to Wolfe for help. The first four claims have shared certain characteristics: in the first, for example, the best selling author Ellen Sturdevant is accused by the virtually unknown Alice Porter of stealing a recent book's plot from a story that Porter sent her, asking her suggestions for improvement. Sturdevant ignores the accusation until Porter's manuscript is found in Sturdevant's house. The writing and publishing industry is convinced that the manuscript was planted, but the case was settled out of court. That scenario, with minor variations, is repeated four times, with other authors and by other plagiarists. The latest complaint has been made only recently, and the target of the complaint wonders when a manuscript will show up somewhere that it wasn't the day before. Wolfe's first step is to acquire and read the manuscripts that form the basis for the complaints. Wolfe's love of literature turns out to be useful in his investigation: from the internal evidence in the manuscripts, Wolfe concludes that they were all written by the same person. Aspects such as diction, punctuation and syntax ‚Äì and, most convincingly, paragraphing ‚Äì point Wolfe directly to the conclusion that one person wrote all the manuscripts. At first, this seems like progress, but then it becomes clear that it's the opposite. The task initially seemed to be to show that the first fraud inspired a sequence of copycats, and the universe of suspects was limited to the complainants. But now that Wolfe has determined that one person wrote all the fraudulent manuscripts, that one person could be anyone. Wolfe meets with the joint committee to discuss the situation. A committee member suggests that one of the plagiarists be offered money, along with a guarantee of immunity, to identify the manuscripts' actual author. The committee concurs, and asks Wolfe to arrange for the offer to be made to Simon Jacobs. The next day, Archie goes to make the offer to Jacobs, but finds Sergeant Purley Stebbins at the Jacobs apartment: Mr. Jacobs has been murdered, stabbed to death the night before. In short order, Archie discovers two more dead plagiarists. Wolfe blames himself for not taking steps to protect Jacobs and the others, who had been made targets by the plan to pay for information. The only one left is Alice Porter, who first worked the fraud successfully, and who is now repeating it with Amy Wynn and her publisher. Wolfe, concentrating on Porter, catches her in a contradiction that identifies the murderer for him.

I've spent the past four decades reading and re-reading Stout's novels for pleasure, and they have yet to lose their savor ... It is to revel in such writing that I return time and again to Stout's books, and in particular to The League of Frightened Men, Some Buried Caesar, The Silent Speaker, Too Many Women, Murder by the Book, Before Midnight, Plot It Yourself, Too Many Clients, The Doorbell Rang, and Death of a Doxy, which are for me the best of all the full-length Wolfe novels.

He was occupied in trade with East Germany before the German reunification. According to investigations by the German parliament, Schlaff was an unofficial employee of the Stasi. His Stasi codename was \\"Landgraf\\" and registration number \\"3886-86\\". His net worth is estimated over ‚Ç¨8 billion. Career with East Germany Schlaff was born in Vienna, Austria to Jewish refugees from World War II. He and his brother James took over the commercial firm Robert Placzek AG. The Stasi archives have files about him as early as 1982. Schlaff had several meetings with East German officials in 1982. Stasi documents describe how Senior Stasi officers were impressed with Schlaff's \\"extensive holdings, his various companies, and his access to the needed America technology\\". According to the German parliament's investigations, Schlaff supplied East Germany with goods that were embargoed by the West. Disappeared public funds after the Fall of the Berlin Wall When the parliament of Germany investigated public funds that disappeared after the Fall of the Berlin Wall, it found out that East Germany (GDR) had transferred large amounts of money to Schlaff through accounts in Vaduz, the capital of Liechtenstein, in return for goods \\"under Western embargo\\". Moreover, high-ranking Stasi officers continued their post-GDR careers in management positions in Schlaff's group of companies. For example, in 1990 Herbert Kohler, Stasi commander in Dresden, transferred 170 million marks to Schlaff for \\"harddisks\\" and months later went to work for him. The investigations concluded that \\"Schlaff's empire of companies played a crucial role\\" in the Stasi attempts to secure the financial future of Stasi agents and keep the intelligence network alive. The Stern magazine noted that KGB officer Vladimir Putin (now President of Russia) worked with his Stasi colleagues in Dresden simultaneously.

It is a member organisation of Common Cause (the alliance of republican movements in The Commonwealth) and the Alliance of European Republican Movements and is currently the only organisation solely campaigning for a republican constitution for Britain. Republic states that its mission is: \\"To achieve the abolition of the British monarchy in favour of a democratic republic\\". Robbie Parkin is the current Chair and Graham Smith is the current Chief Executive Officer of Republic. History Originally created by a small group of republicans in London in 1983, Republic was reinvented as a campaigning pressure group in 2006, when it became formally set up as a limited company (Republic Campaign Ltd) with a board of directors and Executive Office. During the period between the announcement of the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2010 and the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2012 the group's supporters increased from around 9,000 to around 30,000, with around 500 new members being gained at the time of the 2011 Royal Wedding. By 2015 the group had two full-time members of staff and an income of ¬£140,000. In 2016 it had over 5,000 paying members and about 35,000 online supporters. Campaigns and issues A 2016 Republic protest banner. In wishing her a happy 90th birthday, the group addresses Elizabeth II as an ordinary, equal citizen, \\"Mrs Windsor\\", and goes on to argue her long life does not justify being head of state for so long, and that the monarchy should be abolished. CEO Graham Smith criticised hereditary power as being \\"absurd\\" and monarchy as an outdated political institution that \\"abuses its position, abuses public money and which gives politicians too much power.\\" Republic has said that after the death of Queen Elizabeth II it intends to mount a campaign for a referendum on the future of the monarchy. The group plans to do this during the period between the Queen's funeral and the coronation of Prince Charles. Royal finances Republic asserts that there is a lack of transparency and accountability with respect to the funding of the monarchy. The group believes the royal finances should be independently audited by the National Audit Office, like all other central government departments, and that the monarchy's exemption from the Freedom of Information Act should be removed. Republic's response to the annual royal finance reports is reported in the media.Cost of Royal Family rises ¬£1.5m. BBC, dated 29 June 2009. In 2009, while Buckingham Palace claimed the total cost of the monarchy to be ¬£41.5m, Republic estimated the figure at ¬£334 million, once additional costs such as royal security had been taken into account.Head of State Expenditure, 29 June 2009. Retrieved 23 February 2010. Republic's calculations do not factor in the profits of the Crown Estate, which are transferred to the national coffers in return for the civil list (a payment superseded by the Sovereign Grant in 2012); they assert that the Crown Estate is the property of the monarch only in their capacity as Head of State, and therefore state property. Prince Charles and the Duchy of Cornwall In May 2007 Republic persuaded Brian Iddon MP to table an early day motion about the lack of transparency in the Duchy of Cornwall's accounts. Following a legal ruling in 2011 that the Duchy of Cornwall was separate from Prince Charles for the purposes of regulation, Republic asked HM Revenue and Customs to investigate if the Duchy should still be exempt from tax. The tax exemption is based on the assumption that the Duchy estate is inseparable from the tax exempt person of Prince Charles, which is now open to question. In 2013, lobbying by Republic resulted in William Nye, Prince Charles's private secretary, appearing before the Public Accounts Committee to explain the Duchy's tax arrangements. Republic regularly criticises Prince Charles for expressing forthright views and lobbying on political issues, which the group says is unconstitutional.Don't be a meddling monarch, Charles.

During 2015 Republic launched a campaign and petition Take Back the Duchy to abolish the Duchy of Cornwall and transfer its land and assets to the Crown Estate. In December 2015 a freedom of information request by Republic revealed that Prince Charles had routine access to confidential government papers. Oaths of allegiance In 2008 Republic launched a campaign to give republicans an alternative oath of allegiance. The campaign began with an Early Day Motion and was taken up by human rights lawyer Louise Christian.MPs' Queen oath faces legal fight. BBC, dated 15 August 2008.  Royal wedding in 2011 In advance of the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the tourist organisation VisitBritain said that the event would be good for tourism. In response Republic made a freedom of information request for VisitBritain documents which indicated that royal weddings had in the past had a negative effect on tourism. Republic held an alternative street party in London at the Royal Wedding, \\"celebrating democracy and people power rather than inherited privilege\\", along with other events across the UK's major cities. Republic's London event had initially been blocked by Camden Council.  BBC coverage of the monarchy  Republic has claimed that the BBC displays bias in relation to its reporting of royal matters. The documentary The Diamond Queen was criticised for this: in a letter to the chairman of the BBC Trust, Chris Patten, Graham Smith, the organisation's Chief Executive, argued that the programme breached BBC guidelines on impartiality. In his letter, Smith claimed the series was subject to \\"distortions, half-truths and fabrications\\".BBC royal series The Diamond Queen biased, Republic says, BBC NewsBBC's jubilee documentary 'one-sided', says republican pressure group, Ben Dowell, The Guardian, 24 February 2012 Legal context Advocacy of the replacement of the monarchy with a republic has been an imprisonable offence in law. The Treason Felony Act 1848 prohibits the advocacy of a republic in print. The penalty for such advocacy, even if the republic is to be set up by peaceful means, is lifetime imprisonment. This Act remains in force in the United Kingdom. However, under the Human Rights Act 1998, the Law Lords have held that although the Treason Felony Act remains on the statute books it must be interpreted so as to be compatible with the Human Rights Act, and therefore no longer prohibits peaceful republican activity.R.

Greenberg visited Jamaica from a young age, and was a friend of Bob Marley. Following Marley's death, Marley's family asked Greenberg to make a film about Marley. In 1981, Greenberg filmed Land of Look Behind (1982), a documentary film that includes footage of Marley's funeral as well as scenes filmed in Jamaica's remote Cockpit Country and the capital city of Kingston. The film ended up being more of a visionary portrait of the Jamaica of that period (focusing on the Rastafari movement and reggae culture) than a film primarily about Marley. The film has won considerable critical acclaim, as well as winning the Gold Hugo Award for Best Documentary in the Chicago International Film Festival, the U.S.'s largest film competition. Land of Look Behind has also been honored as the best American documentary film of its era, and the legendary filmmaker Werner Herzog says \\"'Land of Look Behind' has achieved things never seen before in cinema.\\" Greenberg worked closely with Werner Herzog on many projects. He served as a special unit photographer on the films Cape Fear by Martin Scorsese (1991), and 1900 by Bernardo Bertolucci (1976). He also wrote twenty screenplays and three books. His book Heart of Glass, about the making of the 1976 Werner Herzog masterwork of the same name, was called \\"The best book on the making of a film ever written\\" by Rolling Stone magazine. A new and entirely revised edition of the book, entitled, \\"EVERY NIGHT THE TREES DISAPPEAR: Werner Herzog and the Making of 'Heart of Glass'\\" was published in hard cover by the Chicago Review Press.

As an island archipelago New Zealand accumulated bird diversity and when Captain James Cook arrived in the 1770s he noted that the bird song was deafening. The mix includes species with unusual biology such as the kakapo which is the world's only flightless, nocturnal parrot which also exhibits competitive display breeding using leks. There are also many species that are similar to neighbouring land areas. A process of colonisation, speciation and extinction has been at play over many millions of years, including recent times. Some species have arrived in human recorded history while others arrived before but are little changed. History after human settlement Artist's rendition of a Haast's eagle attacking two moa When humans arrived in New Zealand about 700 years ago the environment changed quickly. Several species were hunted to extinction, most notably the moa (Dinornithidae) and Haast's eagle (Harpagornis moorei). The most damage was caused by habitat destruction and the other animals humans brought with them, particularly rats ‚Äì the Polynesian rat or kiore introduced by MƒÅori and the brown rat and black rat subsequently introduced by Europeans. Mice, dogs, cats, stoats, weasels, pigs, goats, deer, hedgehogs, and Australian possums also put pressure upon native bird species. The flightless birds were especially sensitive. Consequently, many bird species became extinct, and others remain critically endangered. Several species are now confined only to offshore islands, or to fenced \\"ecological islands\\" from which predators have been eliminated. New Zealand is today a world leader in the techniques required to bring severely endangered species back from the brink of extinction. Many bird species were introduced during the early years of European settlement to control insects as New Zealand birds species generally preferred a native bush habitat rather than the open fields that the settlers were creating. Other species were introduced for sport and European birds also provide a connection with the settler's homelands as some areas of New Zealand had a starkly different appearance to the countries the settlers came from. Comparison to global bird fauna Kea (Nestor notabilis) is the world's only alpine parrot and has high intelligence and inquisitiveness The terrestrial birds, wetland birds and seabirds in New Zealand each make up about a third of the total number of species. This is in sharp contrast to the composition of the global bird species where 90% are terrestrial. When humans first arrived in New Zealand, there were at least 131 species of land, freshwater and coastal birds, and another 65 species of seabirds (gulls, albatrosses, petrels and penguins), making at least 196 native species in total, according to a 1997 report (this count may have risen since as subspecies have been reclassified as species). Of the 131 species that lived on or near land, 93 (or 71%) were endemic, and of the 65 seabirds, 22 (or 34%) were endemic, making 115 (or 59%) endemic species in total. Conservation Adult takahƒì feeding a chick Due to habitat loss, their historical use as a food source by MƒÅori, and predation by introduced species, many birds have become extinct and numerous more are threatened with extinction. Huge conservation efforts are being made to save the takahƒì, kakapo, mohua, kokako, hihi and the kiwi. One well documented conservation success story, due in a large part to the efforts of Don Merton, is the saving of the black robin on the Chatham Islands. From the time of first human settlement until 1994, 43 (or 46%) of the 93 endemic land, freshwater and coastal bird species have become extinct, as have 4 of the 22 endemic seabird species (making 41% of all endemic species extinct), according to a 1997 report. Fifteen species extinctions have occurred since 1840 (this count will have risen to 16 when the North Island snipe was raised from subspecies to species level). According to the 2005 New Zealand Threat Classification System list, 153 species or subspecies were then threatened with extinction.

Northampton County Prison is a county-level prison located in Easton, Pennsylvania in the United States. The prison is situated adjacent to the Northampton County Courthouse and consists of four inter-connected buildings. It contains 15 separate housing units and a community corrections facility (work release) with a capacity of 913 inmates. History The newly formed Northampton County built its first jailhouse in 1753. The building was located in Easton's Centre Square. The building was constructed from massive stone walls and served two purposes, to detain prisoners and to act as a safe house in the event of an attack from nearby Native American tribes. In 1851 the jail was relocated to Sitgreaves Street. The new building contained 27 cells and was surrounded by high walls. In 1861 the Northampton County courthouse was built on its present site on Washington Street. The jail was too small at this time and offered an inconvenience in transporting prisoners to and from the courthouse. In 1868 work began on a new prison adjacent to the courthouse. The building was completed in 1871 at a cost of $200,000. The building has undergone major renovation due to overcrowding. In 1909 an addition was completed and soon after a wall was erected to contain an outside recreation area to comply with state law. In 1993 two direct supervision units were added soon followed by the free standing Community Corrections Facility. In 2004 Northampton County Council approved a 22.8 million dollar expansion. The new expansion was completed in 2006 and consisted of 2 towers with three podular/direct supervision units, a new intake unit and connected the buildings.

Sixel, short for \\"six pixels\\", is a bitmap graphics format supported by terminals and printers from DEC. It consists of a pattern six pixels high and one wide, resulting in 64 possible patterns. Each possible pattern is assigned an ASCII character, making the sixels easy to transmit on 7-bit serial links. Sixel was first introduced as a way of sending bitmap graphics to DEC dot matrix printers like the LA50. After being put into \\"sixel mode\\" the following data was interpreted to directly control six of the pins in the nine-pin print head. A string of sixel characters encodes a single 6-pixel high row of the image. The system was later re-used as a way to send bitmap data to the VT200 series and VT320 terminals when defining custom character sets. A series of sixels are used to transfer the bitmap for each character. This feature is known as soft character sets or dynamically redefinable character sets (DRCS). With the VT240, VT241, VT330, and VT340, the terminals could decode a complete sixel image to the screen, like those previously sent to printers. Description Sixel encodes images by breaking up the bitmap into a series of 6-pixel high horizontal strips. Each 1-pixel- wide vertical column in a particular strip forms a single sixel. Each sixel's pixels are read as binary and encoded into a single 6-bit number, with \\"on\\" pixels encoded as a 1. This number, from 0 to 63 decimal, is then converted into a single ASCII character, offset by 63 so that an all-black sixel, 0 decimal, is encoded as . This ensures that the sixels remain within the printable character range of the ASCII character set. Carriage return (CR) is represented by , and line feeds (LF) with a ; both had to be sent in turn to return the cursor to the start of the line, . Sixel also includes a rudimentary form of compression, using run-length encoding (RLE). This is accomplished with the character followed by a decimal number of the times to repeat, and then a single sixel character to be repeated. Since the and decimal digits cannot be valid sixel data, lying outside the encoded range, the encoding is easy to identify and expand back out in software. \\"Sixel mode\\" is entered by sending the sequence . The p1 through p3 were optional setup parameters, with p1 defining an aspect ratio (deprecated in favor of p3), p2 how to interpret the color of zeros, and p3 with simple grid size parameters. is the standard DEC \\"Device Control String\\", or DCS, which was used to turn on or off a number of special features in DEC's equipment. The \\"q\\" is the sixel identifier. Sixel data then followed the q. The \\"Stop Text\\" sequence returned the device back to normal character mode again. For printing, sixels are sent to the printer, decoded back into binary, and sent directly to six pins in the print head. The only complexity involved expanding the RLEs into the internal print buffer. Display on a terminal is somewhat more difficult. On terminals supporting graphics, the ReGIS graphics system was used to directly draw the sixel pattern into the screen's bitmap. This was done at high speed by storing the bitmap patterns as a glyph and then blitting them. When used for defining custom character sets the format was almost identical, although the escape codes changed. In terms of the data, the only major difference is the replacement of the separate CR/LF with a single \`/\`. In the VT300 series for instance, 80-column character glyphs were 15 pixels wide by 12 high, meaning that a character could be defined by sending a total of 30 sixels. Color is also supported using the character, followed by a number referring to one of a number of color registers, which varied from device to device. The colors in the registers are defined using either RGB or HLS values in a peculiar DEC format. To create a color image on a printer, a line of sixels is sent several times, each representing a single bitplane from the register-based colors on the terminals (normally 2 or 4 bits). Since the capabilities of the hardware vary widely, a color sixel drawing can only be output to targeted devices. Non-graphics terminals generally silently ignore sixel escape sequences. Sample The sample Sixel code that says \\"HI\\" displayed in a xterm with VT340 emulation.

The \`#0;2;0;0;0\` is interpreted as \\"set color register 0, use RGB mode (2), set R, G and B to 0\\". This sets color 0 to black, and the following commands set register 1 to yellow and 2 to green. The data lines following select a color, yellow for the first and third and green for the middle, then draw sixels. The last line shows the RLE in use. These sixels form the shape \\"HI\\".

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago White Sox. Personal life Danks graduated from Round Rock High School in Texas in 2003 and was named the co-central Texas player of the year that season.Davis, Danny. \\"Diamonds are for her brothers, but Danks also a gem\\" , Austin American-Statesman, October 30, 2007. During high school, he played for Andrew Prater's Austin Baseball Club (ABC) summer league team. \\"John Danks, who graduated in 2003, just finished his first complete season as a starting pitcher for the Chicago White Sox.\\" Danks was drafted in the first round, ninth overall in the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft by the Texas Rangers. His brother, Jordan Danks, was his teammate on the White Sox from 2012-2014. Danks proposed to girlfriend, country artist Ashley Monroe of the Pistol Annies, on September 14, 2012 after Monroe finished the Annies' first show of their headlining tour. They were married on October 24, 2013.http://tasteofcountry.com/ashley-monroe-married-john-danks/ Professional career=Minor Leagues Danks, along with pitchers Nick Masset and Jacob Rasner, was traded by the Rangers to the White Sox for pitcher Brandon McCarthy and outfielder David Paisano on December 23, . Chicago White Sox As a top prospect for the Chicago White Sox in , he was selected as the team's fifth starter in their rotation. The 72-90 White Sox provided Danks with little support in the first half of the season; he was 5-6 with an acceptable 4.62 ERA before the break. Down the stretch, Danks tired, and he was shut down for the year after a slow September start. Danks finished the second half 1-7 with a 7.11 ERA. For the season, he finished with a record of 6-13 with a dismal 5.50 ERA in 26 starts. The White Sox opted to use Danks in the starting rotation again in 2008 and he did not disappoint. The second-year lefty pitched masterfully, ranking among the league leaders in ERA all season and taking no-hit games beyond the fifth inning on several occasions. Danks set career bests in nearly every major statistical category, finishing with a 12-9 record, 3.32 ERA (fifth in the American League) and 1.23 WHIP in 33 starts. Danks finished just short of the benchmark 200 regular- season innings, hurling 195. Making his first career short-rest start in the one-game playoff for the American League Central Division title, Danks defeated the visiting Minnesota Twins 1-0 with eight dominant innings of two- hit ball. The victory propelled the White Sox into the postseason. Danks followed up his stellar 2008 season onto the 2009 season as he finished with a record of 13-11 with a 3.77 ERA in innings. He set career highs in the 2010 season in wins (15), innings (213) and strikeouts (162). The 2011 season saw Danks struggle through injury, as he made only 27 starts. He finished with a record of 8-12 in innings. On December 29, 2011, Danks agreed on a five-year, $65 million deal, which took him through his final arbitration eligible season and his first four free agency years. Danks made $8 million in 2012 and $14.25 million from 2013-2016. On May 25, 2012, Danks was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a left shoulder strain. That injury turned out to be season-ending, as he had surgery on August 6 on his left shoulder to \\"explore and correct issues\\" found there. He was hoping to come back in late September, but instead opted towards having the surgery so he could be ready for 2013 spring training. In 9 starts with Chicago, he went 3-4 with a 5.70 ERA with 30 strikeouts in 53.2 innings. Danks on the mound in Seattle in 2015 On August 25, 2013, Danks was the winning pitcher during a 5-2 victory over the Texas Rangers. During that game his brother, Jordan Danks, hit a go-ahead home run. According to Elias Sports Bureau, it was the first time since June 5, 1955, that a player homered in support of his brother pitching, when Kansas City catcher Billy Shantz homered in support of his brother Bobby Shantz. Overall, Danks struggled through injury once again as he finished with a 4-14 record in 22 starts. In 2014, Danks was healthy throughout the season for the first time since 2010. He finished with a record of 11-11 in 32 starts. In 2015, Danks pitched through the worst season of his career since his rookie season as he finished with a career worst 7-15 record in 30 starts. On May 3, 2016, Danks was designated for assignment after struggling early in the 2016 season with a 7.25 ERA after four starts. Atlanta Braves Danks signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves in December 2016. He was released on March 20, 2017. Scouting report Danks has a very live arm, and has a good four-seam fastball in the 90-92 mph range. His best strikeout pitch is a sharp cutter that comes in at 87-88 mph. Danks also has a very good straight change that he uses very effectively against righties at 82-84 mph. In addition, Danks has a big, slow curveball in the 76-77 mph range that he can throw early in the count to get strikes. He also fairly frequently throws a two-seam fastball. Danks throws with an over-the-top delivery.

They began as a home-recorded duo of Jonathan and his wife Hilary, sharing tapes through the cassette underground. In the 1990s the band evolved into a studio-recorded full lineup, which dissolved in 2000. In 2005, Jonathan and Hilary began home-recording again as \\"The Original Silly Pillows.\\" History In the early 1980s, Jonathan had been part of punk/psych/experimental group The Killer Asparagus (in the Boston area) and punk pop band The Degrads (in Rochester, NY, along with his brother Sam Elwitt). Jonathan started recording cassettes at home in 1984, and in 1986 he asked his wife Hilary Caws-Elwitt to join him on vocals, choosing the name The Silly Pillows for the project. The first Silly Pillows recordings were circulated on cassette through the growing network of home tapers, spurred by positive reviews in the magazines Option and Sound Choice (who said that \\"their whole catalog is essential listening\\").Jack Jordan, Sound Choice, Summer 1990, No. 15, p 85 In 1992, Hilary decided to stop singing, but by then their cassettes had attracted some attention in Europe. The tracks on the Silly Pillows' first vinyl release, \\"When She Gets Home,\\" were home-recorded. In 1993, Jonathan assembled a group of friends for the Silly Pillows' first studio recordings, which were released as the \\"Equilibrium\\" EP on Norway's Perfect Pop label. The first studio lineup was Jonathan, his co-worker Cheryl De Luke, Sam, and Christopher Earl of Squires of the Subterrain. Over the next few years, more studio recordings were released on vinyl and CD by Perfect Pop and a German label, Little Teddy, bringing the band notice such places as Chickfactor (\\"It just bubbles over with vintage ambience and playfulness.... and it's more than just slightly pretty\\"Chickfactor, Fall/Winter 1995, No. 5) and The Village Voice (making Elisabeth Vincentelli's \\"Pazz & Jop\\" top-10 list in 1996Music Supplement, Village Voice, February 20, 1996). In 1996, the possibility of a Japanese tour led Jonathan to assemble a lineup that could perform live: Jonathan (vocals), Sam (guitar), Michael E. Fiato (bass), Dave Joachim (drums; later a best-selling cookbook author), singer- songwriter/artist Linda Smith (vocals), and Charlie Zayleskie (keyboards). Although the tour never happened, the Silly Pillows performed in New York and a few other locations, opening for some well-known acts like The Magnetic Fields. Belinda Miller of the kids' radio show Greasy Kid Stuff later became the female co-vocalist; Time Out New York likened the Caws-Elwitt‚ÄìMiller stage presence to \\"Mexican jumping beans.\\"Time Out New York, February 12‚Äì19, 1998 In Japan, where a split single (with Citrus) on Rover Records had reached No. 3 on the domestic singles chart, enthusiasm was high enough that a subsidiary of major Japanese label Teichiku Records released a \\"best-of\\" compilation, Pillow Paw Prints, in 1997. New Affections, released in 1998, was the Pillows' last full-length label recording. In 2000, the band set up a temporary studio at the Caws-Elwitt home in Friendsville, Pennsylvania, to record a new project, but soon after the lineup dissolved. The five song EP that had been recorded was released online as Tomorrow Is Yesterday. After a hiatus, Jonathan began writing and recording at home again. Eventually Hilary decided to try singing again, and as \\"The Original Silly Pillows,\\" they have recorded a few new tracks since 2005. In 2007, Jonathan, Charlie, and Hilary made two pop- festival appearances as \\"Silly Piano Pillows.\\" In 2010, an instrumental rendition of a 1990 Silly Pillows track was released by Nada Surf as part of their covers album If I Had a Hi-Fi. Style Stylistically, the band's music has been described as \\"gems replete with incisive hooks, mindblowing harmonies and solos, and varied multilayered instrumentation with creative stylistic unpredictability and arresting rhythms.\\"Jack Jordan, Option, Sept./Oct. 1989, No. 28, p 142 Jonathan has stated that his goal is to achieve \\"exuberance, sincerity, and beauty without sadness.\\" Side projects *Jonathan and Hilary have collaborated with home-tapers Dan Fioretti, who now identifies as female and is known as Dreamgirl Stephanie Ashlyn, and Ken Clinger. *Hilary's brother, Matthew Caws, is now the singer/guitarist in Nada Surf.

The castle was the family seat of the O'Sullivan M√≥r family from the late 16th century. History The four-storey tower house was built in the 13th century on a limestone outcrop as a Norman (Carew) stronghold. Several later structures of the castle, including an enclosed court, date to the late 16th century, when Owen O'Sullivan became 'Chief of the Name' and acceded to the title of 'O'Sullivan M√≥r'. An inscribed plaque, dated 1596, recorded the castle's association with the O'Sullivan M√≥r and MacCarthy Reagh dynasties. The castle was the family seat of the O'Sullivan M√≥r for some time. The main O'Sullivan M√≥r familial seat moved to nearby Cappanacush Castle during the 17th century, and antiquary Samuel Lewis noted that both castles were \\"traditionally said to have been defended\\" by their O'Sullivan M√≥r owners during the mid-17th century Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. The O'Sullivan castles and lands at Dunkerron and Cappanacush were confiscated following this conflict under the Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652, and assigned to Cromwellian supporter William Petty. Later O'Sullivan attempts to have the lands returned were not successful. By the 19th century, maps record the castle and court as being \\"in ruins\\", and a Victorian manor house, Dunkerron House, was built on the estate around that time. Text from an inscribed stone which is dated 1596, and attributes certain works at the castle to Owen O'Sullivan M√≥r and his wife Sily N√≠ Donogh MacCarthy Reagh.Friar O'Sullivan's JCHAS article of 1896 places this plaque over the fireplace. A later errata note to the JCHAS article places the plaque over a well in the demesne. Title One of the last members of a branch of the O'Sullivans was Donal O'Sullivan, who died on 16 April 1754, without issue or heirs. The title he bore, the \\"Prince of Dunkerron\\", became extinct on his death. The British monarchy did issue a peerage title of Baron Dunkeron to John Petty. (John Petty was Sheriff of Kerry from 1732, and a descendant of the William Petty to whom the lands had been given following the Cromwellian confiscations). The title assigned to Petty was not however related to the original title of the native Irish nobility.

The company, whose library is owned and distributed by the Phoenix Learning Group, Inc., covered a wide range of subjects in zoology, science, geography, history and math, but is mostly remembered today for its post-World War II social guidance films featuring topics such as dating, family life, courtesy, and citizenship. Overview David A. Smart established the company with his brothers Alfred and John in 1934,Alexander, Geoff. Academic Films for the Classroom: A History . 2010. McFarland & Company, p. 29-31 but the first titles registered for copyright date from 1941 (beginning with Aptitudes and Occupations). Over time, a studio was set up in Glenview, Illinois. Smart was the publisher of Esquire and Coronet magazines, and the film company was named for the latter. The film company outlived the magazine; it ceased publication in 1976. In addition to military instructional films produced during the war, the company was successful in its early years with full color films spotlighting common birds like the ruby-throated hummingbird (a 1942 release), many of these filmed by Olin Sewall Pettingill Jr. and Dr. Arthur A. Allen. One hallmark was that many titles were shot in color Kodachrome a few years ahead of competing classroom film companies. Production costs were kept under control by making both color and black and white prints available and charging a much lower fee for the latter. However, many school educators economized so fewer color prints are viewable today. After David Smart‚Äôs death in 1952, his brother John, and Jack Abraham took over. Coronet‚Äôs output had surpassed in quantity that of the classroom film industry‚Äôs leader, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Films (initially ERPI Classroom Films), with an eleven-minute or longer film completed practically every week. While their biggest rival strove to be more ‚Äúcinematic‚Äù with very creative takes on science and geography subjects to make them as entertaining for students as possible, the 1950s and 1960s Coronet films often had a dry, lecture-like tone to their commentary. However, there were some well-made travelogues, boasting good cinematography, in addition to an annual quota of animal-interest topics. Starting in 1957, a \\"Special Productions\\" unit headed by Bob Kohl and Tom Riha added some more ambitious and prestigious independent productions to Coronet's more economically made \\"in-house\\" titles in its catalog. Coronet was still very active during the 1973-4 school year, when it placed over 60 titles for evaluation with Project METRO of the Capitol Region Education Council (CREC), in central Connecticut. Titles included A Is For Alphabet, Color, Color Everywhere, Dating Scene, and Understanding Shakespeare: His Stagecraft.METRO's \\"1974 MULTI-MEDIA EVALUATION REPORT\\" (privately printed and distributed to member school districts in central Connecticut)[need link] The 1970s were a creative period for the company, despite the fact that 16mm educational films were gradually replaced by video cassettes and computers as key audio-visual classroom tools a decade later. After Hal Kopel replaced Jack Abraham as general manager (around 1972), the look and style of the films received a much-needed \\"facelift\\" and film credits belatedly included directors and the creative personnel. (Most released previously listed only educational consultants.) This was in response to ongoing criticism that the Coronet films were too \\"stodgy and unimaginative\\".Alexander, Geoff. Academic Films for the Classroom: A History . p. 30 & 78 Many earlier titles were \\"revised\\" with better-produced and more- entertaining editions during this period. By the early 1980s, however, the company was becoming more of a distributor of other company films than a producer. Sheldon Sachs became vice president in 1979 and headed a \\"Perspective Films\\" division to increase Coronet's distribution of outside productions, making theatrical award winners like Sparky Greene's American Shoeshine available for classroom viewing. In 1981, Coronet also acquired Centron Corporation. Shortly after merging with MTI films in 1984 (with a new VP, Joel Marks), Coronet and its acquisitions were taken over by Gulf and Western Industries (but Coronet veteran Bob Kohl bought back Centron as a separate entity to run himself). Simon & Schuster, part of the conglomerate, moved the (reduced) filming facilities to New Jersey a decade later. In May 1997, Phoenix Learning Group took over the distribution rights to the Coronet catalog. Personal guidance films Beginning with Shy Guy (1947), featuring an early appearance of a 19-year-old Dick York of Bewitched fame, the company gained considerable renewed attention for a cluster of ‚Äúpersonal guidance‚Äù films aimed at instructing school students on how to make the best decisions. Typical titles include Are You Popular?, Everyday Courtesy and What To Do On A Date, along with a Korean War-period series Are You Ready For The Service? Ted Peshak was a key director, although screen credit were often reserved for psychology consultants only. Many were filmed in color, but usually exist today in black and white since educators generally economized with the cheaper format available. Most were made prior to David Smart‚Äôs passing in 1952, but a few more were added as late as the 1970s, such as Beginning Responsibility: A Lunchroom Goes Bananas. Since most were produced early in the post-war film boom; they were typical of the quality, production values, and content of media of the period and were subsequently often considered humorous in the context of the post mid-1960s sexual revolution. After the earliest films entered the public domain (a large percentage of the library is still privately owned), the films of Coronet were recognized by many as notable kitsch, especially after a few became shorts for Pee-wee's Playhouse & the cable TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) which mocked the films' production values and underlying messages. Shorts featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) include Are You Ready for Marriage? and What to Do on a Date. Many of Coronet's other films were later riffed by Rifftrax, a successor to MST3K, created by former MST3K cast member Michael J. Nelson. The company participated in a compilation spoof, titled The Great American Student (1978). Made by veteran director Mel Waskin and editor Bob Gronowski and lifting many key scenes from the older films that showcased words such as \\"swell\\", it was distributed like any other educational 16mm film of the period as a joke on unsuspecting libraries.

Born in St. Kitts in the Caribbean, Browne moved with her family to Canada in 1970. She spent her formative years in Regent Park, Canada's oldest and largest low-income community. It was in this Toronto community where the seeds of Browne's filmmaker career were planted. She participated and then led the Regent Park Video workshop project and contributed to the production of many documentary videos about the community. It was during this time Browne decided to go to film school. She attended the film program at Ryerson Polytechnic Institute. After leaving Ryerson, she worked for a small film company before starting her own production company, Syncopated Productions in 1990. Her first two films, Brothers in Music and No Choices (a segment of movie Five Feminist Minutes), debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival in 1991 and launched Browne's film career. From that time onward she has consistently produced heartfelt work that has tackled hard-hitting difficult topics such as poverty and abortion. She has worked independently and has also done projects with the National Film Board of Canada and the Canadian Broadcast Corporation, OMNI TV and many others. Her films have won numerous awards and have been screened and broadcast all over the world. In 1999 Browne completed her first dramatic feature, Another Planet, and became the first Black woman to direct and write a feature film in Canada. Most recently Browne completed Speaking in Tongues: The History of Language, an extensive documentary series that looks at the history of language from prehistoric time to the present day, for which she received the Women's International Film & Television Showcase (WIFTS) Foundation Best Documentary Award 2011.Women's International Film & Television Showcase. In addition to working as filmmaker Browne has also worked as curator and media arts instructor. Browne's first novel, Two Women, a cautionary tale about two women who share the same soul, was released in 2013.

It may present the time solely as sounds, such as a phone-based time service (see \\"Speaking clock\\") or a clock for the visually impaired, or may have a sound feature in addition to an analog or digital face.  History  Although they would not be considered to be speaking, clocks have incorporated noisemakers such as clangs, chimes, gongs, melodies, and the sounds of cuckoos or roosters from almost the beginning of the mechanical clock. Soon after Thomas Edison's invention of the phonograph, the earliest attempts to make a clock that incorporated a voice were made. Around 1878, Frank Lambert invented a machine that used a voice recorded on a lead cylinder to call out the hours. Lambert used lead in place of Edison's soft tinfoil. In 1992, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized this as the oldest known sound recording that was playableAaron Cramer with Allen Koenigsberg The World‚Äôs Oldest Recording: Frank Lambert's Amazing Time Machine ‚Äì Part 2 (Retrieved on February 2, 2007) (though that status now rests with a phonautogram of √âdouard-L√©on Scott de Martinville, recorded in 1857). It is on display at the National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, Pennsylvania. Although there have been rumors that other talking clocks may have been produced afterward, it is not until around 1910 that another talking clock was introduced, when Bernhard Hiller created a clock that used a belt with a recording on it to announce the time. However, these belts were often broken by the hand-tightening required, and all attempts to reproduce the celluloid ribbon have so far failed. In 1933, the first practical use of talking clocks was seen when Ernest Esclangon created a talking telephone time service in Paris, France. On its first day, February 14, 1933, more than 140,000 calls were received. London began a similar service three years later. This type of talking time service is still around, and more than a million calls per year are received for the NIST's Telephone Time-of-Day Service.National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Telephone Time-of-Day Service (Retrieved on February 2, 2007) The Mattell-a- Time Talking Clock In 1954, Ted Duncan, Inc., released the Hickory Dickory Clock, a crank toy intended for children. This clock used a record, needle, and tone arm to produce its sound. In 1968, the first truly portable talking clock, the Mattel-a-Time Talking Clock, was released. In 1979 Sharp released the world's first quartz-based talking clock, the Talking Time CT-660E (German version CT-660G). Its silver transistor-radio-like case contained complex LSI circuitry with 3 SMD ICs (likely clock CPU, speech CPU and sound IC), producing a Speak&Spell-like; synthetic voice. At the front rim was a small LCD. The alarm spoke the time and also had a melody \\"Boccherini's Minuet\\"; after 5 minutes the alarm repeated with the words \\"Please hurry!\\". It also had stopwatch and countdown timer modes. The tiny controls to turn off alarm or set functions are hard to reach under a small bottom lid.Tech Toy Playground - Sharp Talking Time Comparing English and German Sharp Talking Time In 1984, the Hattori Seiko Co. released their famous pyramid-shaped talking clock, the Pyramid Talk. As a futuristic design object even its LCD was hidden at the bottom, thus people were supposed to always push its top to hear it talk, which is not very practical. Current talking clocks often include many more features than just giving the time; in these, the ability to speak the time is part of a wide range of voice capabilities, such as reading the weather and other information to the user.  Uses and purposes = Teaching timetelling  After the telephone time service, the next practical application of the talking clock was in the teaching of timetelling to children. The first talking clock to be used for this purpose was the Mattel \\"Mattel-a-Time Talking Clock\\" of 1968. Several other clocks of this type followed, including one featuring Thomas the Tank Engine. One of the latest ones, the \\"Talking Clever Clock\\", includes a quiz button which asks questions such as \\"What time is it?\\", \\"What time will it be in an hour?\\", and \\"How much time has passed between 1:00 and 2:30?\\" Other educational talking clocks come in a kit designed to be assembled by children. Talking clocks can also be used with children whose learning disabilities may be partially offset by the reinforcement provided by hearing the time as well as seeing it.  Assisting the blind The Cube Clock, a talking clock designed specifically for blind and visually-impaired users. Talking clocks have found a natural home as an assistive technology for people who are blind or visually impaired. There are over 150 tabletop clocks and 50 types of watches that talk. Manufacturers of such clocks include Sharp, Panasonic, RadioShack, and Reizen. In addition, one manufacturer purportedly produced a clock that would announce the time upon detecting a user's whistling signal.  Branding/Advertising  Many companies have used talking clocks as a novelty item to promote their brand. In 1987, the H. J. Heinz Company released a clock with the figure of \\"Mr. Aristocrat\\", a tomato with a motif similar to Mr. Peanut. At alarm time, the clock said, \\"It's time to get up; get up right away! Wait any longer and it's 'ketchup' all day! Remember, Heinz is the thick rich one.\\" At roughly the same time, Pillsbury created a similar clock with the character of Little Sprout. In recent years, the Coca-Cola polar bear, the Red and Yellow M&M;'s characters, the Pillsbury Doughboy, a Campbell's Soup girl, and others have at one time appeared on a talking clock. One of the more interesting branded clocks was produced by Energizer and was a soft, battery-shaped clock whose alarm was turned off by punching it or throwing it against a hard surface.  Entertainment/conversation pieces  The Talking Jesus Clock. The inexpensiveness of modern speech technology has allowed manufacturers to include talking clock capabilities into a wide range of products. Many of these are intended as conversation pieces or speak merely for the entertainment of hearing sounds or words spoken by an inanimate object. Such timepieces include Darth Vader clocks, calculators with time features, and even a painting of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper that announces the time on the hour along with a quote from Jesus. Other themes of talking timepieces include fortune-telling, astrology, clocks with moving lips, animated creatures, sports and athletes, and movies, among others.  Technology  Most modern talking clocks are based on speech-synthesis integrated circuits that generate speech from sampled, stored data. The rapid technological progress of the 1980s enabled today's high-quality talking products. Early talking clocks employed chips that linked phonemes to generate speech. These products could generate unlimited speech, but it was of relatively poor quality that sounded robotic, at worst, unintelligible. Today's higher-quality speech is produced by sampled-data systems that take elements of an actual human voice. Modern voice synthesis technologies can produce synthesized vocabularies that retain the style of the speaker exactly and are not limited to just perfect English, but can be as varied as Scottish accents, Japanese, and even the voice of a young child. Such voices are all generated using tiny, inexpensive voice chips that are readily available. Almost all of the latest voice-chipped talking clocks incorporate the female human voice to announce the time. Dr. Mark McKinley, the president of the International Society of Talking Clock Collectors, proposes three possible explanations for this phenomenon. The female voice may be considered more soothing psychologically; it may be a relic of the female voice being historically associated with secretarial (Administrative Assistant) functions; or a feminine voice may possibly simply be softer in a less intrusive way.McKinley, Mark B. The Collected History and Significance of Talking Clocks NAWCC Bulletin June 2004;46:331-8 Many talking clocks include a light sensor or a setting that will automatically silence them between certain hours (usually between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.).  Ozen Box  Ozen box layout. Ozen box inside Superman talking clock. Many talking clocks of the 1970s utilized an Ozen box, which is a mechanism similar to a phonograph, in which a needle-like stylus tracks on a 2.25 inch platter similar to a vinyl phonograph record. The Janex Corporation produced most of the clocks which use this device, and they are highly prized among collectors.

Giles and Sophia B. Packard Sophia B. Packard (January 3, 1824 in New Salem, MassachusettsJune 21, 1891 in Washington, D.C.) was an American educator, cofounder in Atlanta, Georgia, of a school for African American women that would eventually become Spelman College. Packard attended local district school and from the age of 14 alternated periods of study with periods of teaching in rural schools. In 1850 she graduated from the Charlestown Female Seminary, and after teaching for several years she became preceptor and a teacher at the New Salem Academy in 1855. After a short-lived attempt to operate her own school in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, in partnership with her longtime companion, Harriet E. Giles, Packard taught at the Connecticut Literary Institution in Suffield (1859‚Äì64). From 1864 to 1867 she was co-principal of the Oread Collegiate Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts. She then moved to Boston, where she secured in 1870 the unusual position of pastor's assistant under the Reverend George C. Lorimer of the Shawmut Avenue Baptist Church and later of the Tremont Temple. In 1877 she presided over the organizing meeting of the Woman's American Baptist Home Mission Society, of which she was chosen treasurer that year and corresponding secretary the next. Harriet E. Giles In 1880 Packard toured the South and decided to open a school for African American women and girls in Georgia. With a gift of $100 from First Baptist Church of Medford, Massachusetts, and a promise of administrative and financial support from the Boston-based Woman's American Baptist Home Mission Society (WABHMS) that sent them, the two women opened a school in the basement of Friendship Baptist Church, an African- American church in southwest Atlanta. Lefever, Harry G, The Early Origins of Spelman College, The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, No. 47 (Spring, 2005), pp. 60-63 Harriet E. Giles and Sophia B. Packard Enrollment at the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary increased rapidly. In addition to teaching in the school, the two women also held prayer meetings, conducted Sunday schools, and taught sewing classes. The American Baptist Home Mission Society (parent of the women's society) made a down payment on a permanent site for the school in 1882, and early in 1883 the school moved to its new home. The balance due was paid in 1884 by John D. Rockefeller, who had been impressed by Packard's vision, and the school was named Spelman Seminary in honour of Rockefeller's wife and her parents. Rockefeller Hall, with offices, a chapel, and dormitory rooms, was built in 1886, and Packard Hall was erected in 1888. With the granting of a state charter in the latter year, Packard became treasurer of the board of trustees. She continued in that post and as president of the school until her death, at which time Spelman Seminary had 464 students and a faculty of 34. Spelman Seminary became Spelman College in 1924, and in 1929 it became affiliated, along with Morehouse College, with Atlanta University.

It is sponsored annually by the USA Dry Pea and Lentil Council, a non-profit organization founded in 1965 for the purpose of promoting and protecting those engaged in growing, processing, warehousing, and merchandising peas, lentils and chickpeas. History The original festival was organized in 1989. The objectives of the festival were to promote tourism to the Palouse Region and to promote the locally grown pulses, particularly lentils. At the time of the original festival, the lentil was selected because over 98% of the United States crop of lentils was then grown in the Palouse. The initial festival drew a crowd of approximately 4,000 people.Whitman County Gazette, Colfax, Washington, September 28, 1989 The only festival casualty was in 2020: the COVID-19 pandemic caused officials to scrap the festival & defer to 2021. Each year The National Lentil Festival is organized with the help of The Pullman Chamber of Commerce and a festival committee in addition to the many volunteers that help make the event run smoothly. The Palouse region grows 18% (2017) of all the lentils in the US, according to the festival's website.

A bullet-hole is visible in the lower right of the torso section (left to the viewer) The European buff coat (the term deriving from the ox or buffalo hide from which it was commonly made and its yellowish colour) was an item of leather clothing primarily worn by cavalry and officers during the 17th century, but also worn by a small number of infantry. It was often worn under armour. the buff coat was derived from the simple leather jerkins employed by huntsmen and soldiers during the Tudor period, these in turn deriving from the arming doublet worn under full plate armour.Tincey (1990), p. 15 Production, appearance and variation Buff coats were made in sleeveless and sleeved variants and were garments typically crafted from cowhide or buffalo hide. The very finest buff coats were made of the hide of the European elk.Brzezinski, p. 12 Buff leather was produced by a method of \\"oil tanning\\"; following treatment with lime the hide was scraped to remove the outer layer, which gave the finished product a matt surface. The hide then had cod oil worked into it in a process called \\"kicking\\" and was finally air-dried. The oiling and drying steps could be repeated. The finished leather attained its characteristic buff colour and was supple, durable and weather resistant.Tincey (2002), p. 59 Due to the thickness of the leather, the seams of these coats were all butt- jointed, with hidden or partially hidden stitches. Extant examples are lined, either with coarse linen or silk. Many high quality examples show apparent fastenings of gold or silver tape at the front, however, these were merely decorative, the real fastenings being hidden hooks and eyes attached to the inside of the join.Blackmore, pp. 19, 22 The extant collection of buff coats preserved at Littlecote House dating to 1649‚Äì1660, contains examples with leather varying from in thickness and entire coats weighing between .Tincey (2002), p. 60 All buff coats had deep skirts attached, which protected the upper legs of the wearer. Most surviving examples have sleeves, but a minority are sleeveless. Sleeves could be of a single thickness of leather from shoulder to wrist, or alternatively of a double thickness from the shoulder to the elbow, with a single thickness, to allow freedom of movement, to the wrist. Some of the highest quality buff coats, typically shown in portraits of officers, had multiple stripes of gold or silver lace running lengthwise down, or hooped around, the sleeves.Haythornthwaite, pp. 25, 37Blackmore, pp. 22‚Äì23 File:Coat MET C.I.50.98.3 F.jpgEnglish buff coat 1630‚Äì1640 showing false fastening of silver tape down the front.

The buff coat has sleeves decorated with bands of gold lace. Portrait of Richard Neville, by William Dobson, 17th century Use The coat provided some protection against cuts by swords and other edged weapons; however the buff coat was ineffective against the thrust; it was also ineffective as a protection from firearms, possibly excepting spent bullets. The buff coat was often worn under the plate armour cuirass, where it helped to cushion the wearer from chafing or bruising by the armour's edges. It was also worn on its own, as the buff coat was much more comfortable to wear for long periods of time than the cuirass. The finest quality buff coats were expensive, often much more so than the munition armour cuirasses typically issued to common soldiers, which may account for their widespread association with officers and other men of greater than average wealth.Blackmore, pp. 18‚Äì19Tincey (2002), p. 18 Together with the lobster-tailed pot helmet and cuirass it formed the basis of the equipment of the harquebusier, the typical type of cavalryman of the English Civil War and other European conflicts of the 17th century. Buff coats were issued to a minority of musketeers in the pike and shot formations to give them some protection during hand-to-hand combat. The buff coat was also worn by civilians requiring a protective and durable garment, such as huntsmen and men travelling on horseback.Haythornthwaite, pp. 25, 45 See also * Gambeson  Citations  Cited works  * Blackmore, D.

The word is now known overwhelmingly from the nursery rhyme \\"Little Miss Muffet\\" which was first printed in 1805. It was originally a variant of the word \\"tuft\\" (e.g. of leaves or flowers), a usage which dates back at least to the 16th century. In the context of the nursery rhyme, the word may refer to a grassy hillock, a small knoll or mound. Perhaps due to misunderstanding of the rhyme, the word has also come to mean a low seat. Uncertain meaning Since the rhyme provides little context, several writers have expressed confusion about its meaning. In 1902, Samuel M. Crothers remarked, \\"Perhaps some of you would like to know what a tuffet is. I have thought of that myself, and have taken the trouble to ask several learned persons. They assure me that the most complete and satisfactory definition is,‚Äîa tuffet is the kind of thing that Miss Muffet sat on.\\" As a grassy mound An Arthur Rackham illustration of 1913, showing a tuffet as a grassy mound According to the Oxford English Dictionary the word in the nursery rhyme may refer to \\"a grassy hillock, a small knoll or mound\\". Recorded examples of \\"tuffet\\" with the related meaning \\"tuft\\" (for example a cluster of short-stalked leaves or flowers growing from a common point) date back to 1553. Merriam-Webster suggests that the word derives from the Anglo-French , from \\"tufe\\", meaning \\"tuft\\". Many illustrators have shown Miss Muffet sitting on a mound or hillock, including John Everett Millais (1884) and Arthur Rackham (1913). As a low seat A Kate Greenaway illustration of 1900, showing a tuffet as a three-legged stool A Frederick Richardson illustration of 1915, showing a tuffet as a low seat A 1940 poster, showing a tuffet as a low seat The Oxford English Dictionary gives a secondary definition \\"hassock or footstool\\", but calls this \\"doubtful\\". It lists an example from 1895 in which the meaning is \\"a three-legged stool\\" and another from 1904 with the meaning \\"footstool\\". Some sources, including Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (1898) and Chambers 20th Century Dictionary (1983), failed to recognise this meaning at all, and listed only the grassy knoll definition. Nevertheless, there is a long tradition of illustrators showing some sort of low seat, including Kate Greenaway (1900) and Frederick Richardson (1915). An 1888 variant of the rhyme has \\"she sat on a buffet\\" which the scholars Iona and Peter Opie point out certainly refers to a stool. Many modern dictionaries including Collins, Merriam-Webster, Chambers 21st Century Dictionary and Oxford Dictionaries give both meanings.

Immediately after his appointment, Anbasa doubled taxes on Christians; however, it is thought that this increase did not affect most of the recently conquered estates and towns, subdued by treaty on very specific conditions (taxes, land ownership, etc.), but lands under direct Arab rule and new towns being conquered in Septimania.Collins, R. (1989) p. 81 Coincidentally, a dynastic struggle arose among Muslims in the Middle East. It was sparked by the death of Caliph Yazid II and the succession of his brother, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 724. On this account, Anbasa tried to please the demands imposed by the Caliph to further tax exaction on non-Muslims, with attempts being made to enforce it on non-Arab Muslims too; there was a popular rebellion in Egypt in 725 for increase in taxation. On the other hand, this more rigorous approach may have provided legal shelter and security to ownership in al-Andalus. These actions caused displeasure, scattered acts of disobedience, as well as some open revolts. During his tenure in office, Pelagius of Asturias, defied the Umayyad attempt to extract taxes in the mountains of Asturias, where he gathered a band of rebellious followers. An Umayyad patrol was sent to search for Pelagius and his men, and it was ambushed at the Battle of Covadonga at great loss of life according to heavily mythical Christian sources, a skirmish according to later Muslim chroniclers, who showed little concern for the episode; The Mozarabic Chronicle of 754, a Christian and only almost contemporary account of the major events taking place in Hispania doesn't mention it. In retrospect, these events are viewed by some as the beginning of the Reconquista, an effort by Christian kingdoms to wrest control of Hispania from the Muslims. Following the major Ummayyad defeat in Toulouse (721) resulting in Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani's death, Anbasa dispatched several military expeditions into Septimania, and managed to capture the Visigothic town of Carcassonne in 724 (or 725), as well as N√Æmes, the latter without resistance.Collins, R. (1989) p. 87 He went on to lead an expedition to the Kingdom of Burgundy, a Frankish territory, as far north as Autun. However, he died of natural causes in this campaign.Collins, R.

(1989) p. 213 He was succeeded as wali by Udrra ben Abd Allah al-Fihr√≠, who after a few months, was replaced by Yahya ibn Salama al- Kalbi. Yahya denounced the injustices of the policies of Anbasa, especially with respect to the collection of taxes and the confiscation of property.

Dusky flathead are a largely estuarine species and are found in estuaries, estuarine lakes and coastal bays on the east coast of Australia, from Cairns in Queensland to the Gippsland Lakes in Victoria. They occur over sand, mud, gravel and seagrass and can inhabit estuarine waters up to the tidal limit. Morphology Flathead are notable for their unusual body shape, upon which their hunting strategy is based. Flathead are dorsally compressed, meaning their body is wide but flattened and very low in height. Both eyes are on the top of the flattened head, giving excellent binocular vision in order to attack overhead prey. The effect is somewhat similar to flounder. In contrast to flounder however, flathead are much more elongated, the tail remains vertical, and the mouth is large, wide and symmetrical. Flathead use this body structure to hide in sand (their body colour changes to match their background), with only their eyes visible, and explode upwards and outwards to engulf small fish and prawns as they drift over the hidden flathead. The dusky flathead can be distinguished from other flathead by a row of fine brown spots on the pectoral fins. Ecology Dusky flathead, Platycephalus fuscus Dusky flathead are the largest of the many species of flathead found in Australia, and the most commonly caught. Dusky flathead have very rarely been caught at sizes up to 12‚Äì15 kg and lengths up to 1.3 metreshttps://www.daf.qld.gov.au/fish- identification-information/fish-species-guide/fish-species-id- info/profile?fish-id=dusky-flathead, but average size is 0.5‚Äì1.5 kg and 40‚Äì50 cm. Typically a fish of estuaries and estuarine lakes, dusky flathead are rarely found in other habitats. The diet of dusky flathead is typically composed of smaller fish and prawns. Dusky flathead are reported to be hermaphroditic, starting as males and changing to females at a relatively large size, but this has been disputed in more recent studies. Certainly only female fish attain the larger sizes. Breeding is reported to occur in mid to late summer around estuary mouths. A recent study (Pollock 2014) shows that the sex of dusky flathead is determined at the juvenile stage, and that there is no sex inversion from male to female. Fishing Dusky flathead are a popular species for commercial and recreational fishing in eastern Australia. They readily take baits and minnow lures, and on such lures are good fighters. Recently they have proven to be very vulnerable to fishing techniques using jigged soft plastic lures. In the face of heavy fishing pressure and more effective techniques, a largely catch and release approach from anglers is essential nowadays to conserve dusky flathead stocks. Many fishermen generally release dusky flatead over 70 cm, believing that they are important large breeding females. The hypothesis that dusky flathead over 70 cm are \\"important large breeding females\\" is questionable. A study by Pollock (2014) shows that the vast majority of eggs produced by the annual spawning aggregation come from the mid-size females (50 cm‚Äì60 cm), but more importantly the large females over 70 cm are often reproductively senescent‚Äîthat is they have degenerate ovaries in which the eggs are breaking down or have broken down, and are not shed. A study is currently underway in northern New South Wales which is finding at most of the large female flathead (>75 cm) also have degenerate ovaries during the early spawning period (Nov/Dec), whereas the mid-size females have healthy ovaries with developing yolky eggs.

The municipality is named after the Brazilian advocate, journalist and politician J√∫lio Prates de Castilhos. History According to historian Firmino Costa, the land was Indian and was part of the Spanish Empire until 1801, when it was annexed to Portugal. The first pioneers came from the states S√£o Paulo and Paran√°. In 1812 or 1813, Jo√£o Vieira de Alvarenga, about 24, with his wife, Maria Rosa de Morais, and his first son, Manoel, claimed lands between the pioneer cities with the title Sesmaria, which it received in 1826. In 1834, the municipality of Cruz Alta was founded and was separated from Rio Pardo. The municipality was created from the lands of the district of S√£o Martinho, in Cruz Alta. In 1876, with the emancipation of S√£o Martinho, the district of Povo Novo was created. On July 14, 1891,, the municipality of Vila Rica (the new name of Povo Novo) separated from S√£o Martinho. The first municipal elections were held in 1896, with Capit√£o Luiz Gonzaga de Azevedo as the winner and the first mayor. In 1905, the city was renamed to its current name, J√∫lio de Castilhos.

She is credited with initiating the Whitewater investigation against President Bill Clinton. Lewis is a native of Houston, Texas; her father was a major general in the U.S. Army. She has a degree in political science from Sam Houston State College. Lewis joined the Resolution Trust Corporation office in Kansas City, Missouri as a senior criminal investigator in 1991. Among other assignments she was investigating the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, a Little Rock savings and loan company owned by James McDougal, who had been the Clintons' partner in Whitewater, a failed land development project in the Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas. When the connection between the Clintons and McDougal became a news story, she refocused on the Madison Guaranty case. On September 2, 1992, just prior to the 1992 presidential election, she submitted a criminal referral to the FBI naming Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton as witnesses in the Madison Guaranty case. U.S. Attorney Charles A. Banks and the FBI determined that the referral lacked merit, but she continued to pursue it. Between 1992 and 1994 she issued several additional referrals against the Clintons and repeatedly called the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock and the Justice Department about the case. Lewis later appeared before the Senate Whitewater Committee. Before the hearings it was claimed that her testimony could prove to be \\"more troublesome for Bill Clinton than Paula Jones\\"; however, her testimony did not provide any sensational or new information, and she eventually fainted under cross examination and had to be helped from the hearing room. She was later suspected of illegally recording a conversation with a senior government attorney during the investigation. She was herself investigated for various wrongdoings, including misuse and mishandling of classified material, secretly recording conversations with her colleagues, and use of government equipment for personal gain.

The drum is used in many music genres of Haiti and has been influential in the rest of the Caribbean and Latin American world. Etymology Tanbou is derived from the French word tambour, which means drum. Origins The lineage of this Haitian drum is complex, originating in West African Vodun systems. A tanbou needs to be crafted properly in order to get the best sound. The drum is no longer used in Nigeria, but the banda rhythm that has been kept alive by Haitian drummers, such as Bonga (Gaston Jean-Baptiste). Sound A tanbou produces an organic, versatile sound that can be used for dance, professional recording, and supposedly healing and merry making. The drum has survived centuries and some of the oldest are from old temples in Haiti. The older the drum, the better the sound according to the drummers. Construction The tambou is made with a stick like a vessel; a hardwood - tronp√®t, bwachen, gomye-and covered with a piece of animal skin or a material capable of awe as the skins in a corner are made goat or cow. These drums can be used like regular congas. It is very difficult to get drums from Haiti into the United States because crafting them is equally challenging due to the finding the right wood and particularly the skins which must be procured under the exact conditions.

Its mission is to end hunger in its community. Founded in 1987, REFB is Sonoma County's largest hunger-relief organization, serving 133 charitable organizations, including emergency food pantries/closets, shelters and dining rooms, childcare centers/youth programs, group homes, and disaster relief agencies. Seniors, children, and working families come to food distributions seeking supplemental groceries. REFB acquires food and distributes it through a network of charitable agencies and its own food assistance programs and also provides food to Lake, Mendocino, Humboldt, and Del Norte Counties through smaller food banks. In addition, the REFB advocates for legislation to provide long-term solutions to hunger in its community.  Recipients  In 2018, The Redwood Empire Food Bank distributed the equivalent of 40 million meals, or 40,000 per day. Each year, the Redwood Empire Food Bank serves 82,000 people across five counties ‚Äî Sonoma County, Lake County, Mendocino County, Humboldt County, and Del Norte County. A January 2010 report estimated that REFB was providing emergency food for over 110,000 different people annually, and that in any given week about 26,000 different people were receiving emergency food assistance. In late 2010, REFB was serving 78,000 monthly meals, an increase of more than 11 percent over 2009. Operations= Food collection and distribution  The vast majority of Redwood Empire Food Bank's work is direct service. Approximately 70% of the food distributed through the food bank goes out through 300+ pop-up food distributions each month. The remaining food is distributed through the Agency Shopping Program, which provides food to 170+ member charities that serve people in need. The food bank's 2007 holiday food drive set a goal to collect of food and $160,000.  Education  The Redwood Empire Food Bank addresses the needs of low-income seniors living with diabetes through the Diabetes Wellness program. In 2012, REFB began implementing a three-year, $800,000 project, funded by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation, to address type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Wellness Project provides food and educational materials to individuals, and conducts screenings. Much of the project is being done in partnership with Sonoma County healthcare providers.  2013 expansion  In September 2011, Redwood Empire Food Bank purchased a 60,000-square-foot building near the Charles M. Schulz ‚Äì Sonoma County Airport for $5 million. It opened the building after investing $2.5 million in renovations and improvements, including a 5,000-square-foot freezer and cooler, warehouse racking, truck docks and offices. The new location also created a new \\"value marketplace\\" grocery store for low-income families, bringing dignity to the WIC and CalFresh shopping experience. The building groundbreaking celebration was in October 2012. The new building is three times the size of the building that REFB had occupied since 1998, and opened in early 2013. The building also replaced three building spaces that REFB was renting.

Tooth loss is normal for deciduous teeth (baby teeth), when they are replaced by a person's adult teeth. Otherwise, losing teeth is undesirable and is the result of injury or disease, such as dental avulsion, tooth decay, and gum disease. The condition of being toothless or missing one or more teeth is called edentulism.  Tooth exfoliation in children  A young boy after losing two baby teeth, exfoliated in response to the permanent teeth beneath, which will erupt through the gums to take their place. Normal loss of primary teeth typically begins around age six and continues until age twelve. The upper and lower central incisors are shed at age six to seven years. The upper and lower lateral incisors are shed at seven to eight years. The upper canines are shed at ten to twelve years. The lower canines are shed at nine to twelve years. The upper and lower first molars are shed at nine to eleven years. The upper and lower second molars are shed at ten to twelve years.  Pathological tooth loss =Causes and prevention As a person ages, their permanent teeth have been exposed to normal mechanical forces, such as chewing, and also more abnormal mechanical forces, such as bruxism (grinding) and traumatic injury. Permanent teeth may also be affected by oral disease. There are many ways in which a person may protect his or her permanent teeth from loss. The main method of preventing tooth loss is prevention of oral diseases. Tooth loss can be due to tooth decay and gum disease. Tooth decay is caused by increased plaque retention. Bacteria can then invade the plaque and cause dental caries (cavities). If cavities persist untreated for an extended period of time, tooth breakdown occurs. Plaque retention and bacterial presence also affect the gums and bone and their ability to hold the teeth in place. Disease of the gums, known as periodontitis, leads to detachment of the supporting structures from the teeth and their eventual loss. Tooth loss due to tooth decay and gum disease may be prevented by practicing good oral hygiene, and regular check-ups at a dentist's office. Good oral hygiene consists of brushing two times a day with a fluoridated toothpaste and flossing. Dental check-ups should occur every six months. Children or adults who are incapable of caring for their own teeth should be assisted with oral hygiene in order to prevent tooth loss. In contact sports, risk of mouth trauma and tooth injury is reduced by wearing mouthguards and helmets with a facemask (e.g., a football helmet, a goalie mask). Nightguards may also be implemented in the case of teeth grinding (bruxism) during sleep. These guards function in limiting the wear and force applied to the teeth. In turn, this minimizes the chance of loss. In countries such as the United States, Japan, Germany, and Italy, there is a strong relationship between cigarette smoking and tooth loss. Studies have shown that an increase in exposure to cigarette smoking can increase the risk of tooth loss. In addition, studies have also found that when people stop smoking, there is a decrease in tooth loss. Proper nutrition has been shown to prevent tooth loss by providing the nutrients necessary to maintain enamel strength. Tooth loss occurs more often in people from the lower end of the socioeconomic scale. =Secondary to disease= Tooth loss can occur secondary or concomitantly to many diseases. Diseases may cause periodontal disease or bone loss to prompt tooth loss. Consequently, periodontal disease may cause increased infection, which may predispose a person to other diseases. Diseases commonly related to tooth loss include, but are not limited to: cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus. Therefore, it is important to not only maintain good oral hygiene, but also overall good health. Missing tooth replacement Maximum preservation and protection of natural teeth is best for eating and chewing; however, there are three basic ways to replace a missing tooth or teeth, including a fixed dental bridge, dentures, and dental implants. Each alternative has its own benefits and drawbacks. It is important to consider a patient's medical, financial, and emotional situation. It is recommended that a patient experiencing tooth loss visits a dentist to discuss which replacement method is best suited for his or her situation. It has been shown that a non-removable replacement, such as a bridge or implant appears to provide patients with the best sense of security and well-being. =Research= Researchers in Japan have successfully regrown fully functional teeth in mice. Epithelial and mesenchymal cells were extracted from the mice, cultured to produce a tooth \\"germ\\", and the germ was then implanted into the bone at the space of a missing tooth. A tooth of the correct external and internal structure, hardness, strength, and sensitivity later erupted in the space, eventually meeting the opposing tooth in a manner similar to an original natural tooth. This technique may be a possible future treatment for replacement of missing teeth.

Description Sepiola atlantica has short fins which do not overlap the mantle margin either anteriorly or posteriorly. The four arms have two series of suckers close to the body and 4 to 8 rows of minute suckers toward their tips. The remaining arms have two rows of suckers. A hectocotylus is present, the left dorsal arm is modified, the near end has a fleshy pad which is formed from enlarged and fused sucker pedicels with the copulatory apparatus being a large swollen horn, which has secondary lobes at its base; the dorsal row of suckers which are placed tword the tip from the copulatory apparatus has 3 or 4 slightly enlarged suckers with swollen pedicels, 3 or 4 vestigial suckers, then 3 to 5 greatly enlarged suckers roughly halfway along arm. The hectocotylised arm is strongly bent towards its tip. The tentacular club has transverse rows of 8 suckers. There is a pair of kidney-shaped photophores within the mantle cavity, one on each side of the animal's ink sac. Both sexes of S. atlantica grow to around in mantle length. Distribution Sepiola atlantica has a latitudinal range from 65¬∫N to 35¬∫N, ranging from Iceland, the Faroe Islands and western Norway in the north south to the Moroccan coast. There is a single record of this species from the Mediterranean Sea, a mature male caught in the Tyrrhenian Sea at a depth of 90m.Reid, A. & P. Jereb 2005. Family Sepiolidae. In: P. Jereb & C.F.E.

The type specimen was collected in the Bay of Biscay and is deposited at the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris.Current Classification of Recent Cephalopoda Biology Sepiola atlantica is a small species which occurs in a variety of marine habitats extending from shallow water to the upper slope of the continental shelf. It is a benthic species but itt has been recorded from the water column during both day and night. Like many species in the family Sepiolidae, S. atlanticus possesses a light organ which may be used to countershade the animal. The mature males have a fleshy bulb and enlarged suckers on the distal end of the left first arm. In Firemore Bay, Loch Ewe, off the coast of Scotland spawning appears has been recorded as occurring throughput the year, peaking in April and again in July to August. Related species of bobtail squid are benthic animals that typically hide by burying themselves in soft substrates in daytime, and then at night they emerge to feed. The resident population of Firemore Bay has a variable age composition, further suggesting that this species has an extended reproductive season. At this site juveniles are recorded throughout the year, however recruitment of juveniles into the population shows peaks in April and July to August. During mating, the male typically approaches the female, grasping the ventral region of the female's mantle while using the dorsal arm to transfer the spermatophores to the female's mantle cavity. Mating typically lasts from 68 to 80 minutes. During this time, the female may change in color or pattern, while the male's coloration generally stays constant.

Personal life Aideu Handique was born on 1920 in Pani Dihingiya, Golaghat, Assam to Nilambar Handique and Malakhi Handique. She remained unmarried because she referred to the co-actor assuming the role of her character's husband as Bongohordeo (Assamese for husband) in the film. Unfortunately, the general public perceived Handique as having violated a cultural taboo and she was, consequently, shunned by neighbors and would sink into solitude and obscurity.  Recognition  She never acted after Joymoti again except for a minuscule role in the film Ganga Siloni and a guest appearance in a film made on her life. In 1985, when Assam celebrated the golden jubilee of the state's cinema, her role was acknowledged. The East Indian Motion Picture Association had gifted Aideu a wheelchair. The Assam Government, much later, gave her Rs.1,500 a month as pension. It also recommended her name for Padmashri, but was denied the award because she had done only one film.

It was released in 1965 on the Musicor Records label. Background New Country Hits features Jones's first studio recording of \\"Take Me\\", a song he co-wrote with Leon Payne and would record more famously with Tammy Wynette. The album also includes the hits \\"Love Bug\\" (inspired by Buck Owens and the Bakersfield sound) and the self-pitying \\"Things Have Gone To Pieces\\". Although he stuck to country music with a vengeance, Jones did his best to record a wide range of songs under the country umbrella, stating in the 1989 documentary Same Ole Me, \\"I've always tried to be versatile. I've always tried to do up-tempos and novelties and ballads.\\" The album is also noteworthy for its cover, which features the singer's backing band the Jones Boys. Like Buck Owens' Buckaroos and Merle Haggard's Strangers, Jones worked with many musicians who were great talents in their own right, including Johnny Paycheck, who played bass and sang harmony with Jones before going on to his own stardom in the 1970s. Paycheck is seated next to Jones on the cover of the album. Reception Upon release, New Country Hits rose to number 5 on the country music album chart.

The concept was first proposed by cognitive anthropologist Jean Lave and educational theorist Etienne Wenger in their 1991 book Situated Learning . Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book Communities of Practice . A CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally . CoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunch room at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \\"virtual community of practice\\" (VCoP) when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance . A \\"mobile community of practice\\" (MCoP) is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go. Communities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in American pragmatism, especially C. S. Peirce's concept of the \\"community of inquiry\\" , but also John Dewey's principle of learning through occupation .  Overview  For Etienne Wenger, learning is central to human identity. A primary focus of Wenger's more recent work is on learning as social participation ‚Äì the individual as an active participant in the practices of social communities, and in the construction of his/her identity through these communities . In this context, a community of practice is a group of individuals participating in communal activity, and experiencing/continuously creating their shared identity through engaging in and contributing to the practices of their communities. The structural characteristics of a community of practice are again redefined to a domain of knowledge, a notion of community and a practice: * Domain: A domain of knowledge creates common ground, inspires members to participate, guides their learning and gives meaning to their actions. * Community:The notion of a community creates the social fabric for that learning. A strong community fosters interactions and encourages a willingness to share ideas. * Practice: While the domain provides the general area of interest for the community, the practice is the specific focus around which the community develops, shares and maintains its core of knowledge. In many organizations, communities of practice have become an integral part of the organization structure . These communities take on knowledge stewarding tasks that were formerly covered by more formal organizational structures. In some organizations there are both formal and informal communities of practice. There is a great deal of interest within organizations to encourage, support, and sponsor communities of practice in order to benefit from shared knowledge that may lead to higher productivity . Communities of practice are now viewed by many in the business setting as a means to capturing the tacit knowledge, or the know-how that is not so easily articulated. An important aspect and function of communities of practice is increasing organization performance. identify four areas of organizational performance that can be affected by communities of practice: * Decreasing the learning curve of new employees * Responding more rapidly to customer needs and inquiries * Reducing rework and preventing \\"reinvention of the wheel\\" * Spawning new ideas for products and services  Types =Compared to functional or project teams Collaboration constellations differ in various ways. Some are under organizational control (e.g., teams, see below) others, like CoPs, are self-organized or under the control of individuals. For examples of how these and other collaboration types vary in terms of their temporal or boundary focus and the basis of their members' relationships, see . A project team differs from a community of practice in several significant ways . * A project team is driven by deliverables with shared goals, milestones and results. * A project team meets to share and exchange information and experiences just as the community of practice does, but team membership is defined by task. * A project team typically has designated members who remain consistent in their roles during the project. * A project team is dissolved once its mission is accomplished. By contrast, * A community of practice is often organically created, with as many objectives as members of that community. * Community membership is defined by the knowledge of the members. CoP membership changes and members may take on new roles within the community as interests and needs arise. * A community of practice can exist as long as the members believe they have something to contribute to it, or gain from it. Versus communities of interest In addition to the distinction between CoP and other types of organizational groupings found in the workplace, in some cases it is useful to differentiate CoP from community of interest (CoI). Community of interest * A group of people interested in sharing information and discussing a particular topic that interests them. * Members are not necessarily experts or practitioners of the topic around which the CoI has formed. * The purpose of the CoI is to provide a place where people who share a common interest can go and exchange information, ask questions, and express their opinions about the topic. * Membership in a CoI is not dependent upon expertise ‚Äì one only needs to be interested in the subject. Community of practice * A CoP, in contrast, is a group of people who are active practitioners. * CoP participation is not appropriate for non- practitioners. * The purpose of a CoP, as discussed above, is to provide a way for practitioners to share tips and best practices, ask questions of their colleagues, and provide support for each other. * Membership is dependent on expertise ‚Äì one should have at least some recent experience performing in the role or subject area of the CoP.  Benefits =Social capital Social capital is said to be a multi-dimensional concept, with both public and private facets (Bourdieu 1991).Bourdieu, P. (1991). Language and symbolic power. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press That is, social capital may provide value to both the individual and the group as a whole. Through informal connections that participants build in their community of practice, and in the process of sharing their expertise, learning from others, and participating in the group, members are said to be acquiring social capital ‚Äì especially those members who demonstrate expertise and experience.  Knowledge management  describe three kinds of knowledge: \\"knowledge as object\\", \\"knowledge embedded within individuals\\", and \\"knowledge embedded in a community\\".Wasko, M.; Faraj, S. (2000). \\"\\"It is what one does\\": why people participate and help others in electronic communities of practice\\". Journal of Strategic Information Systems. 9 (2-3): 155‚Äì173. doi:10.1016/S0963-8687(00)00045-7 Communities of Practice have become associated with finding, sharing, transferring, and archiving knowledge, as well as making explicit \\"expertise\\", or tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is considered to be those valuable context-based experiences that cannot easily be captured, codified and stored , also . Because knowledge management is seen \\"primarily as a problem of capturing, organizing, and retrieving information, evoking notions of databases, documents, query languages, and data mining\\" , the community of practice, collectively and individually, is considered a rich potential source of helpful information in the form of actual experiences; in other words, best practices. Thus, for knowledge management, a community of practice is one source of content and context that if codified, documented and archived can be accessed for later use.  Factors =Individuals Members of communities of practice are thought to be more efficient and effective conduits of information and experiences. While organizations tend to provide manuals to meet the training needs of their employees, CoPs help foster the process of storytelling among colleagues which, in turn, helps them strengthen their skills on the job . Studies have shown that workers spend a third of their time looking for information and are five times more likely to turn to a co-worker rather than an explicit source of information (book, manual, or database) . Time is saved by conferring with members of a CoP. Members of the community have tacit knowledge, which can be difficult to store and retrieve outside. For example, one person can share the best way to handle a situation based on his experiences, which may enable the other person to avoid mistakes and shorten the learning curve. In a CoP, members can openly discuss and brainstorm about a project, which can lead to new capabilities. The type of information that is shared and learned in a CoP is boundless . clarifies the difference between tacit knowledge, or knowing how, and explicit knowledge, or knowing what. Performing optimally in a job requires being able to convert theory into practice. Communities of practice help the individual bridge the gap between knowing what and knowing how . As members of communities of practice, individuals report increased communication with people (professionals, interested parties, hobbyists), less dependence on geographic proximity, and the generation of new knowledge . =Social presence= Communicating with others in a community of practice involves creating social presence. defines social presence as \\"the degree of salience of another person in an interaction and the consequent salience of an interpersonal relationship\\" (p. 38). It is believed that social presence affects how likely an individual is of participating in a CoP (especially in online environments) . Management of a community of practice often faces many barriers that inhibit individuals from engaging in knowledge exchange. Some of the reasons for these barriers are egos and personal attacks, large overwhelming CoPs, and time constraints . =Motivation= Motivation to share knowledge is critical to success in communities of practice. Studies show that members are motivated to become active participants in a CoP when they view knowledge as meant for the public good, a moral obligation and/or as a community interest . Members of a community of practice can also be motivated to participate by using methods such as tangible returns (promotion, raises or bonuses), intangible returns (reputation, self-esteem) and community interest (exchange of practice related knowledge, interaction). =Collaboration= Collaboration is essential to ensuring that communities of practice thrive. Research has found that certain factors can indicate a higher level of collaboration in knowledge exchange in a business network . Sveiby and Simons found that more seasoned colleagues tend to foster a more collaborative culture. Additionally they noted that a higher educational level also predicts a tendency to favor collaboration.  Cultivating successful CoPs  What makes a community of practice succeed depends on the purpose and objective of the community as well as the interests and resources of the members of that community. Wenger identified seven actions that could be taken in order to cultivate communities of practice: # Design the community to evolve naturally ‚Äì Because the nature of a community of practice is dynamic, in that the interests, goals, and members are subject to change, CoP forums should be designed to support shifts in focus. # Create opportunities for open dialog within and with outside perspectives ‚Äì While the members and their knowledge are the CoP's most valuable resource, it is also beneficial to look outside of the CoP to understand the different possibilities for achieving their learning goals. # Welcome and allow different levels of participation ‚Äì Wenger identifies 3 main levels of participation. 1) The core group who participate intensely in the community through discussions and projects. This group typically takes on leadership roles in guiding the group 2) The active group who attend and participate regularly, but not to the level of the leaders. 3) The peripheral group who, while they are passive participants in the community, still learn from their level of involvement. Wenger notes the third group typically represents the majority of the community. # Develop both public and private community spaces ‚Äì While CoPs typically operate in public spaces where all members share, discuss and explore ideas, they should also offer private exchanges. Different members of the CoP could coordinate relationships among members and resources in an individualized approach based on specific needs. # Focus on the value of the community ‚Äì CoPs should create opportunities for participants to explicitly discuss the value and productivity of their participation in the group. # Combine familiarity and excitement ‚Äì CoPs should offer the expected learning opportunities as part of their structure, and opportunities for members to shape their learning experience together by brainstorming and examining the conventional and radical wisdom related to their topic. # Find and nurture a regular rhythm for the community ‚Äì CoPs should coordinate a thriving cycle of activities and events that allow for the members to regularly meet, reflect, and evolve. The rhythm, or pace, should maintain an anticipated level of engagement to sustain the vibrancy of the community, yet not be so fast-paced that it becomes unwieldy and overwhelming in its intensity .  History  Since the publication of \\"Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation\\" , communities of practice have been the focus of attention, first as a theory of learning and later as part of the field of knowledge management. See for a review of how the concept has changed over the years. offers a more critical view of the different ways in which the term communities of practice can be interpreted.  Early years  To understand how learning occurs outside the classroom while at the Institute for Research on Learning, Lave and Wenger studied how newcomers or novices to informal groups become established members of those groups . Lave and Wenger first used the term communities of practice to describe learning through practice and participation, which they named situated learning. The structure of the community was created over time through a process of legitimate peripheral participation. Legitimation and participation together define the characteristic ways of belonging to a community whereas peripherality and participation are concerned with location and identity in the social world . Lave and Wenger's research looked at how apprenticeships help people learn. They found that when newcomers join an established group or community, they spend some time initially observing and perhaps performing simple tasks in basic roles as they learn how the group works and how they can participate (an apprentice electrician, for example would watch and learn before actually doing any electrical work; initially taking on small simple jobs and eventually more complicated ones). Lave and Wenger described this socialization process as legitimate peripheral participation. The term \\"community of practice\\" is that group that Lave and Wenger referred to, who share a common interest and a desire to learn from and contribute to the community with their variety of experiences .  Later years  In his later work, abandoned the concept of legitimate peripheral participation and used the idea of an inherent tension in a duality instead. He identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice, participation-reification, designed-emergent, identification-negotiability and local-global, although the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest because of its links to knowledge management. He describes the structure of a CoP as consisting of three interrelated terms: 'mutual engagement', 'joint enterprise' and 'shared repertoire' . * Mutual Engagement: Firstly, through participation in the community, members establish norms and build collaborative relationships; this is termed mutual engagement. These relationships are the ties that bind the members of the community together as a social entity. * Joint Enterprise: Secondly, through their interactions, they create a shared understanding of what binds them together; this is termed the joint enterprise. The joint enterprise is (re)negotiated by its members and is sometimes referred to as the 'domain' of the community. * Shared Repertoire: Finally, as part of its practice, the community produces a set of communal resources, which is termed their shared repertoire; this is used in the pursuit of their joint enterprise and can include both literal and symbolic meanings.  Society and culture = Examples  The communities Lave and Wenger studied were naturally forming as practitioners of craft and skill-based activities met to share experiences and insights . Lave and Wenger observed situated learning within a community of practice among Yucat√°n midwives, Liberian tailors, navy quartermasters and meat cutters as well as insurance claims processors. . Other fields have made use of the concept of CoPs. Examples include education , sociolinguistics, material anthropology, medical education, second language acquisition , Parliamentary Budget Offices , health care and business sectors, and child mental health practice (AMBIT). A famous example of a community of practice within an organization is that which developed around the Xerox customer service representatives who repaired the machines in the field . These Xerox reps began exchanging repair tips and tricks in informal meetings over breakfast or lunch. Eventually, Xerox saw the value of these interactions and created the Eureka project to allow these interactions to be shared across the global network of representatives. The Eureka database has been estimated to have saved the corporation $100 million. Examples of large virtual CoPs include: * Wikipedia * HIFA - Healthcare Information for All * SuSanA - Sustainable Sanitation Alliance  See also  * Adaptive management * Discourse community * Distributed leadership * Duality (CoPs) * Guild * Knowledge transfer * Knowledge tagging * Learning community * Learning organization * Network of practice * Organizational learning * Personal network * Professional learning community * Social environment * Situated cognition * Situated learning * Value network * Value network analysis * Virtual community of practice  References    * * ; first published in 1990 as Institute for Research on Learning report 90-0013    Further reading  * * Bourdieu, P.

Founded in 1747, it is the oldest community library still occupying its original building in the United States. The original building was designed by Peter Harrison and completed in 1750, and is a National Historic Landmark. History 18th Century The original section of the building was constructed built between 1748 and 1750 by architect Peter Harrison. Only the Library Company of Philadelphia is older, founded in 1731 by Benjamin Franklin. The Redwood Library and Athenaeum predates the Charleston Library Society (founded in 1748), New York Society Library (founded in 1754), and the Boston Athenaeum (founded in 1807). It was the first classical public building built in America, designed in the manner of Italian Renaissance Architect Andrea Palladio, in the Georgian-Palladian style. The main facade facing Bellevue avenue is based upon a plate in Edward Hoppus' Andrea Palladio's Architecture published in 1735.The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., \\"Building America.\\" The oldest section, today called the Harrison Room, still houses the majority of the original books that were purchased as a collection in London. Occupying British troops allegedly looted numerous books (many of which were later returned) prior to the Battle of Rhode Island during the American Revolution. Ezra Stiles was one of the most prominent librarians at the Library, the influential founder of Brown University and later president of Yale University. 19th Century In 1833 the Library furthered its abilities as an institution, and re established itself as The Company of the Redwood Library and Athenaeum. By 1858, membership and collection had grown so much as that an expansion was needed. This expansion, which became known as the Roderick Terry Reading Room was produced by George Snell of Boston. Within 10 years of the Reading Room being completed, architect Richard Morris Hunt was contacted to furnish another expansion for the library. His plans ultimately called for \\"an entirely new and enlarged structure of stone and marble shall (that) take the place of the existing wooden erections.\\" Ultimately, Hunt's plans were rejected, although it is unclear whether that was due to monetary restriction on the part of the Redwood Library, or their disapproval of what could be construed as Hunt's irreverence for Peter Harrison's architecture. In 1875, plans did go forward to develop another expansion to the Library. The Rovensky Delivery Room was designed by famed architect George Champlin Mason. At the time, the collections were in closed stacks, and when a book was requested, the librarian would retrieve it and bring it to the member in the delivery room. 20th Century In 1915, historian and architect Norman Isham restored the eighteenth century Harrison room to what he concluded was its original appearance. The Library's modern collection now includes more than 200,000 volumes as well as a museum collection of art and artifacts. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.NHL listing summary, accessed June 20, 2008 Gallery Image:Ezra Stiles.jpgEarly Redwood librarian, co- founder of Brown University and President of Yale University, The Rev.

Plot introduction A man who identifies himself as Thomas Yeager, head of Continental Plastics, asks Archie to ascertain whether he is being followed when he visits a certain address in one of New York's worst neighborhoods. When the real Yeager's body is found at an excavation site in the vicinity of that address, Archie crosses the threshold and finds a fantastically appointed love nest where Yeager secretly entertained many women. The case becomes more complicated when the daughter of the building superintendent is later killed; her novice attempts at blackmail provide Wolfe with critical evidence needed to solve both murders and earn a large fee, shoring up his low bank account balance. In short order, Wolfe and Archie find themselves beset by prospective clients: * the Yeager imposter, who allows himself to briefly be thought of as a client and who sparks Archie's interest * the building superintendent and his wife, who want Archie to keep the police from harassing them (and, later, to catch their daughter's killer) * an actress, who offers to pay Archie to get her cigarette case out of the love nest * the directors of Continental Plastics, who want to keep the existence of that room from becoming public knowledge and causing a scandal * Yeager's widow, who expects Wolfe to solve her husband's murder even if it embarrasses the company Archy and Mehitabel In the novel, Archie jokes that he‚Äôs going to send out Christmas cards signed ‚ÄúArchie and Mehitabel,‚Äù implying that his wife‚Äôs name is Mehitabel. He isn‚Äôt married, and he‚Äôs making a reference to Archy and Mehitabel, a series of satiric essays and poems written by Don Marquis and originally published in the 1910s and ‚Äò20s. Archy, the supposed writer of the pieces, is a cockroach, and his best friend is Mehitabel, a cat. Reviews and commentary * Anthony Boucher, The New York Times Book Review (November 20, 1960) ‚Äî Wolfe happens to possess a fragment of inside information on the murder of unusually whole-hearted satyr. Problem: how to parlay this fragment into a sizable fee from a client? Wolfe finally accepts a unique commission to produce the murderer without ever revealing to the police the exact scene of the crime. All markedly ingenious and satisfactory. *Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime ‚Äî Good treatment of the love-nest theme, integral as well as central, which implies good characterization. Several new touches prevent the reader from taking Wolfe as a clich√©. The sole reservation to be made is that the villain is not well enough concealed, perhaps because he is so well cast.Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig. A Catalogue of Crime. New York: Harper & Row. 1971, revised and enlarged edition 1989. * Sergeant Cuff, Saturday Review of Literature (November 26, 1960) ‚Äî Archie Goodwin stirs stumps when body of plastics tycoon turns up in Manhattan excavation; mean Inspector Cramer rides herd on Nero Wolfe, but big fellow gets the answer. Easily among his best. *James Sandoe, New York Herald Tribune (November 13, 1960) ‚Äî One of Mr. Stout's brighter books, brisk, light, incisive going. Mr. Stout rarely plays \\"fair\\" and here gives Nero a lot more information than we have (by keeping it away from Archie) so that it can be concluded with a sharp surprise. Excellent diversion. *Terry Teachout, About Last Night, \\"Forty years with Nero Wolfe\\" (January 12, 2009) ‚Äî Rex Stout's witty, fast-moving prose hasn't dated a day, while Wolfe himself is one of the enduringly great eccentrics of popular fiction.

Ommegang of Antwerp The Ommegang in Antwerp originated in the 14th century and is held on 15 August. There were two Ommegang processions held in Antwerp each year: The Ommegang in Antwerp by Alexander van Bredael * the \\"Sinksenommegang\\": held on Pentecost Sunday * the \\"Onze Lieve Vrouwommegang\\": the first Sunday after the Assumption of Mary (15 August). In the 15th, 16th and 17th century the Ommegang of Antwerp was the most important in Flanders.Peter van Aelst, The Ommegang on the Meir in Antwerp, at Jean Moust The \\"Onze Lieve Vrouwommegang\\" consisted originally of two events: the first celebrated the religious feast of the Assumption of Mary. The second was a large, opulent secular participation of the guilds, crafts and chambers of rhetoric, each of which contributed a float to a procession through the streets of Antwerp.Circle of Erasmus de Bie I (Antwerp 1629-1675), The Ommegang in Antwerp at Christie's website Some floats contained references to events of the preceding year. There was considerable rivalry between the guilds in their efforts to provide the most splendid display. In the 17th century the Ommegang of Antwerp comprised these elements in the following order: * the 27 Trades of Antwerp; * \\"de Zottekens\\", comprising the mentally ill from the madhouse of Saint Rochus. Their participation was intended to promote their acceptance in society and to encourage the spectators to pray for their own mental health; * four trumpets and a drum; * the ship, originally made by the Guild of the skippers for the Joyous Entry of Charles V in 1549, symbolised the wealth of Antwerp; * three small foreign ships and seamen carrying goods of these nations; * the whale, in memory of a whale that swam up the Scheldt river and was killed by Antwerp citizens who extracted the whale oil from it. On the whale‚Äôs back sat a Cupid with a water spout, who sprinkled water on the crowd. In 1649 and 1662 Cupid was replaced by Orpheus, as can be seen in our painting; in 1685 and in 1698 by Neptune and in 1609 by Arion. The whale referred of course to the dangers at sea; * two dolphins with two naked children sitting on top of them, referring to the dolphins habit of playing with children. Sabbe mentions that the bases of the whale and of the dolphins were decorated with paintings of fish (as can indeed be seen in our painting); * the float of Neptune and Amphitrite; The Omegang on the Meir in Antwerp in 1885 by Alexander Casteels the Younger * a sculpted elephant (remembering the first one that had arrived in Antwerp in 1563) with a sculpture of Fortuna on a globe, holding a veil. Just like the wind blowing the veil luck may change at any moment; * the giant Druon Antigoon. the giant who according to Antwerp legend had his hand cut off by Antwerp's mythical hero Brabo; * an entourage of childlike jumping male and female giants of foreign countries; * Brabo and a group of young cavaliers; * groups representing events that had occurred in the preceding year; * a combination of Mount Parnassus with Apollo and of Mount Helicon with the Nine Muses and Pegasus; * the float of the Virgins, originally representing Antwerp and the 17 Provinces of the Low Countries, later the beautiful young women of the town; * a jumping, dancing blackamoor, holding a sword, leading a camel with a (Persian) prince; * the important religious part of the procession with several floats; * finally the clergy and the Guilds of the Fencers (in 1662 with Saint Michael holding the devil by a leach), of the Arquebusiers (with Saint Christopher carrying the infant Jesus), of the old and the young bow (with Saint Sebastian), of the old and the new crossbow (with Saint George and the dragon). The Ommegang in Antwerp has been depicted in several paintings by Antwerp artists such as Erasmus de Bie, Alexander van Bredael, Alexander Casteels the Younger and Pieter van Aelst. Ommegang of Brussels The Ommegang in Brussels on 31 May 1615, by Denis van Alsloot The Ommegang of Brussels is celebrated every July in Brussels. According to legend, the origin of the Ommegang of Brussels goes back to a local devout woman named Beatrijs Soetkens. She had a vision in which the Virgin Mary instructed her to steal the miraculous statue of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw op ‚Äòt Stocxken (\\"Our Lady on the little stick\\") in Antwerp, bring it to Brussels, and place it in the chapel of the Crossbowmen's Guild in the Sablon/Zavel district. The woman stole the statue, and through a series of miraculous events, was able to transport it to Brussels by boat in 1348. It was then solemnly placed in the chapel and venerated as the patron of the Guild. The Guild also promised to hold an annual procession, called an Ommegang, in which the statue was carried through Brussels. Through the following decades, what was originally a religious procession took on gradually a more worldly outlook. The Ommegang of 1549 corresponds to a golden age of the procession. From the mid-16th century, the Ommegang not only celebrated the miraculous legend, but became intertwined with the Joyous Entry of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. The Ommegang thus developed into an important religious and civil event in Brussels' annual calendar.Rudi Schrever, Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-ter-Zavelkerk in Brussel'' Other examples of Ommegang Another famous Ommegang in Belgium is the Ros Beiaard Ommegang in Dendermonde. In this ommegang, which is held every ten years, a giant wooden horse is displayed in the town centre. Four boys from the same family of Dendermonde have the honour to 'ride' the horse while it is on display. The Infanta Isabella shooting the Grand Serment bird with a crossbow at the Sablon during the Ommegang in Brussels of 31 May 1615, by Antoon Sallaert The most infrequent Ommegang, only held once every 25 years, is part of the Cavalcade of Hanswijck in Mechelen. The Ommegang element evolved from the annual procession around the city walls held since 1330 as a token of gratitude to Mechelen's patron Saint Rumbold who 'miraculously' ended a siege. A Ros Beiaard which is smaller but older than the one in Dendermonde is mounted in the same manner and the 'family' of six city giants stands out. As in other cities, the commemoration became located largely within its centre. The annual Ducasse at Ath has one of the largest of city giants: Gouyasse (Goliath). Many of these traditions in Belgium and (with only two exceptions, formerly Flemish northern) France are protected as an oral and immaterial cultural legacy by UNESCO, with reference to physical artefacts such as Giants and Dragons (the latter referring to any kind of mythical animals) carried by humans.

Background Although Mr. Country and Western Music includes many of the heartache and drinking songs that Jones had become famous for, this collection of new recordings sees the singer moving towards the more refined Nashville Sound that had been spearheaded by Chet Atkins, Owen Bradley, and a handful of other producers who saw the potential of sweetening the backing tracks with strings and female singers as a way to compete with the ever-increasing popularity of rock and roll. As Bob Allen observes in his book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, \\"These men figured - correctly, as it turned out - that they could make those dollar signs even bigger if they could produce country records that captured the imagination of the much larger, urban- dwelling, pop music-orientated record buying public.\\" In addition to this change in Jones's music, his singing voice had matured and grown noticeably deep since his earliest recordings. Adds Allen: \\"He was now in his mid- thirties, and fewer and fewer of his performances in the studio were charged with the youthful, high-whining honky-tonk fervor and raw rockabilly fire that had echoed so clearly through his early hits. He had come to be more comfortable with the lower and mid-range registers of his voice. Ever so gradually, he was becoming less ill at ease with the mellower \\"uptown\\"-style songs that Pappy (Daily, Jones's producer) was starting to bring around for him to record.\\" By this point, Jones' singing style had evolved from the full- throated, high lonesome sound of Hank Williams and Roy Acuff on his early Starday records to the more refined, subtle style of Lefty Frizzell. In a 2006 interview with Billboard, Jones acknowledged the fellow Texan's influence on his idiosyncratic phrasing: \\"I got that from Lefty. He always made five syllables out of one word.\\" Jones would re-record \\"Don't You Ever Get Tired (Of Hurting Me) in his 1989 album One Woman Man.

Savaging is a term used in the study of ethology that refers to aggressive behaviour displayed by the mother towards the offspring. Aggressive behaviour includes being rough with, injuring, biting, attacking, crushing and killing (maternal infanticide) of the offspring. While savaging behaviour has been seen in multiple species, it is predominantly demonstrated in domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus). As the definition of savaging is so broad, research on the prevalence of savaging behaviour varies with reports of little savaging of offspring to savaging of offspring up to the 20th percentile. Prevalence of aggressive, non-fatal savaging is greater in gilts as piglet-focused aggression is more frequent in young animals than sows. Occurrence of savaging demonstrated by sows is greater if the sow has previously savaged her offspring either as a gilt or sow. Savaging behaviour usually occurs during the first two days after parturition. Prevalence of savaging is similar among first and second farrowing cycles. Savaging behaviour has a significant impact on both agricultural economy and animal welfare which is why it is currently a subject of interest in the pig industry. Environmental factors There exist multiple environmental factors that increase the rate of savaging demonstrated by pigs. It has been shown that human attitudes and behaviour can affect the behaviour of domestic pigs. For example, annoyance and transmission of emotions can occur in gilts and sows when a new worker enters the farrowing rooms and makes excessive noise, does not feed the animals in a timely manner and/or is frustrated/annoyed. Research suggests that maternal behaviour may improve when workers and pigs are familiar with their environment and on a set schedule. Another environmental factor that has been examined is the amount of time spent by humans in the farrowing room. Decreased disturbance of the sows by human intrusions during farrowing has indicated a decrease in savaging behavior. A study by Gonyou and Harris found that increasing light exposure in the farrowing rooms to 16‚Äì24 hours per day decreased piglet deaths due to savaging. A further environmental cause of savaging may be the shock mothers feel upon the arrival of the piglets. Piglet arrival can cause fear and alarm in gilts and sows as a new and unfamiliar stimulus has been presented. Some studies have found evidence of increased savaging rates in larger litter sizes as well. Genetic contribution It has been proposed that the degree of aggressive behaviour displayed prior to farrowing cycles by sows and gilts predicts whether the offspring will be savaged and to what extent. Evidence has also been found that savaging sows may be genetically less likely to crush piglets, which lends to the existing research supporting that savaging sows can be competent mothers. High levels of estradiol at postpartum and high levels of pre-farrowing estradiol to progesterone ratios in gilts show more savaging behaviour to piglets. Additionally, low plasma oxytocin during the immediate postpartum period shows an increase in savaging behaviour. Heritability estimates of 0.11 and 0.25 from half-sib analyses have demonstrated that selection against sow savaging of pigs is possible; however, it may be slow to show effectiveness. Preventive measures The pig industry is investing in research regarding savaging behaviours in hopes to diminish the losses they face when gilts and sows commit infanticide. Sedation techniques following birth have prevented savaging; however, in many cases, the onset of aggression is merely delayed. The industry has also attempted to avoid savaging behavior by limiting reproduction in gilts and sows that have previously savaged their offspring. Efforts to eliminate the behavior include additional care and attention to the mother pig during her farrowing cycles. Savaging in other species Savaging of offspring by the biological mother has been reported in multiple species including farmed silver foxes, farmed wild boar and domestic breeds of farmed pigs. Though aggressive savaging behaviour is demonstrated by other species, it is most commonly used to describe pig aggression. Research has shown that primiparous silver foxes demonstrate savaging shortly after birth with a 37% chance of killing the offspring through bite wounds. Silver foxes have been shown to engage in savaging behaviour followed by infanticide and cannibalism of the offspring. Savaging in wild boars has been found to have genetic significance as different genetic lines have produced varying degrees of savaging. Wild boars have shown aggression after parturition towards their offspring; however, they have lower infanticide rates than other species.

In 1966, the union bought the Piney Point site. The program grew to include other offerings, such as a reading skills program, a high-school equivalency program, an adult basic skills program, and English as a Second Language program. In 1978, SIU entered into an arrangement with Charles County Community College of Maryland which allows participants to earn an Associates of Arts degree. In 1993, the Maryland Higher Education Commission authorized the college program to change its degree award to an Associate of Applied Science degree and to a certificate program in Maritime Technology.

He tallied an 11‚Äì4 record and a 3.51 ERA while striking out 79 opponents and walking 63. King was back with the Tigers in 1987 and he pitched in a career‚Äìhigh 55 games, making only four starts. He saved nine games and finished a total of 26. King's win‚Äìloss record was 6‚Äì9 and his ERA jumped by a whole run to 4.89. His strikeout total climbed slightly to 89 and he walked 60 in 116 innings. In 1988, King appeared in only 23 games for Detroit. He won four times and suffered one loss. King threw 68‚Öî innings, the lowest for any season during his MLB career. His ERA improved to 3.41 and with the lower number of innings pitched, his walk and strikeout totals were almost cut in half, as King fanned 45 batters and walked 34. He started five games and saved three. Prior to the 1989 season, King was acquired by the Chicago White Sox, who sent Kenny Williams to Detroit in exchange. Chicago used King solely as a starter and in 25 starts, King posted a 9‚Äì10 record and a 3.39 ERA. He hurled 159‚Öì innings, striking out 72, but walking 64. King also threw a complete game shutout against the Seattle Mariners on April 22, winning 1‚Äì0. King's second and final season with the White Sox was 1990. He had a 12‚Äì4 win-loss record and posted a career‚Äìlow ERA of 3.28, as he made 25 starts for the second consecutive year. In 151 innings, King's walk total dropped to 40 and he struck 70 opponents. He also hurled a pair of shutouts; against the Kansas City Royals on May 5 and against the Oakland Athletics on June 22. On December 4, 1990, Chicago sent King along with Shawn Hillegas to the Cleveland Indians. The White Sox received Cory Snyder and Lindsay Foster (who never made it to the MLB) in the deal. In 1991, King played for his third major league team, as he appeared in 25 games for Cleveland, all but one as a starter. His 6‚Äì11 record left him with the lowest winning percentage (.353) of his MLB career. King's ERA, which had not been over 3.41 since his second season, jumped all the way to 4.60. Despite this, he threw two complete games and one shutout. King struck out 59 and walked 44 in 150‚Öî innings. King returned to the Tigers for what would prove to be his final major league season in 1992. In 17 games (14 starts), he was 4‚Äì6 with 45 strikeouts, 28 walks, one save and a career- worst 5.22 ERA over 79‚Öì innings.

The European beech used to be fairly common in the western Sistema Central, evidenced by local flora that is characteristic of beech forests.

History and Name Casas de Monle√≥n was founded several hundred years ago (c. 1200) when settlers from the north of Spain repopulated the central ranges after the Reconquista expelled the Moors. The population has waxed and waned and it may not have been inhabited continuously since that time. At some point, Casas de Monle√≥n (literally: houses of Monle√≥n) is said to have been the residence of many of the servants who worked in the adjacent, more upscale town of Monle√≥n, which boasts an enclosing wall and a tower and may have been the seat of local governance for some time. A short walk from the village are some Celtic ruins, mainly tombs hewn out of flat rocks, which folk culture often identifies as ancestral wine presses. On the highest side of the village there is an old Roman Catholic church building that has fallen into ruins. Government Casas de Monle√≥n was formerly incorporated; however, as a result of the sharp decline in the population in the latter twentieth century due to the Spanish miracle which drew many rural people to the cities, it has been annexed to the nearby town of Endrinal de la Sierra. Consequently, it has no mayor, but rather a councilor that serves with two additional councilors of Endrinal and the mayor of Endrinal. Local Culture A village-sized left The majority of the population is composed of farmers. Locals tend their livestock and gardens, some produce of which they sell out of town, and frequently travel for other necessities and socialization. Much of the economy is supported by agricultural subsidies. The village celebrates its patron saint in August. The extended family of residents usually comes from the cities and enjoys the concerts and dancing in the plaza at night; the children have organized games; and everyone meets together for lunch on Sunday to eat paella, also in the main plaza. Castilian Spanish is spoken, with various local colloquialisms influenced by Portuguese, such as inserting the definite article before a possessive pronoun (e.g. la mi casa, instead of only mi casa). Geography Casas de Monle√≥n is in the Tagus watershed with the Santa Mar√≠a stream passing nearby and flowing into the Alag√≥n River, a major tributary of the Tagus. It is near the base of the Sierra de las Quilamas, a ridge between the Sierra de B√©jar and the Sierra de Francia mountain ranges, themselves being ranges in the Sistema Central. It is situated 48 km (30 mi) south of Salamanca proper and 80 km (50 mi) east of Ciudad Rodrigo. Nearby municipalities include Endrinal, Monle√≥n, Los Santos, Linares de Riofr√≠o, and the major meat- processing center for jam√≥n ib√©rico, Guijuelo. Climate and Ecology Casas de Monle√≥n has warm, balmy summers with little rain, foggy and rainy winters, and fickle springs and autumns. Annual precipitation is about 750 mm (30 in.), typical of its mountainous continental Mediterranean climate. The vegetation in the area consists of a mix of Atlantic and Mediterranean continental species including such trees as holm oak, pyrenean oak, chestnut, black poplar, ash, and pines and shrubbery such as brooms and lavender. The fauna comprises various species of snakes, lizards, perching birds, small mammals, and an occasional wild boar.

The district proposed a deficit reduction plan which proposed privatizing transportation and custodial services and laying off 300 district employees, including teachers. In 2017, the school board voted to close the Community Education Center due to increased costs and decreased funding from the state. The district at the time was also completing the Safety, Security and Technology Bond, that was approved by voters in 2014. When it became time to renovate the Community Education Center, it was determined that due to the age and functions of the building, it would not be fiscally-responsible to complete the projects for that building. As of the beginning of the 2017‚Äì2018 school year, the district moved all of the Community Education Center offices to the Educational Services Center. The City of Walled Lake filed lawsuit against the school district to prevent it from being demolished, which the district had gone out to bid for. City officials cited that the building is a landmark in the city, being built in the early 1920s, and many residents were concerned about the new use on that property if sold to a private developer. In spite of this, demolition of the Community Education Center was completed in late 2018. The area in the heart of Walled Lake is currently still empty as of August 2019.

When current passes through the tongue a unique and distinct metallic taste is perceived. Electrogustometry has been in existence since the 1950s. However, not much research has been done in this field. Equipment TR Bull developed an electrogustometer, but it lacked precision and was not widely accepted. In the 1990s the Rion (TR-06) was developed. This was precise and is widely used in the market. The TR-06 is probably the only electrogustometer used now for research and diagnosis. This is manual and needs a trained doctor or nurse to use it. It needs to be manually calculated to arrive at the taste threshold and carry out the false positive tests. Small, light and portable, this hand-held, battery-powered device can be easily placed in any environment. It has an inbuilt false positive detect test. This is developed to cater for the psychophysical analysis of the subject. Influencing factors Electrogustometric taste threshold depends on pulse duration pulse and area of contact of electrode and tongue. Detailed experiments will be performed to prove and discuss their influence on taste threshold with the automatic electrogustometer. Experiments have been performed with the manual TR-06 on to study the effects of these control factors. Philosophy The measure of the minimum amount of current required to excite the sensation of this taste is called the 'taste threshold'. This project involves the design and fabrication of an automatic instrument to measure this taste threshold.

In order to help people outside of the resort town Townsend later gave the formula to Dr. George Bunting, a graduate of Washington College in Maryland, who for many years denied the transaction. In about 1917 Bunting introduced \\"Dr. Bunting's Sunburn Remedy\\" as an alternative to the greasy, tallow-based medicating creams available during the period. For the first three years, Bunting and Elizabeth Buck did all the mixing, heating, and pouring of the product themselves. The product was soon renamed Noxzema and promoted as a skin cream with a variety of uses. In 1920 the Noxzema Chemical Company factory was opened in a house in Baltimore. The Noxzema product was promoted through radio and print advertising, and continued to achieve increasing sales throughout the United States during the 1940s. During the 1950s, the company diversified into other personal care products, including shaving cream, cold cream, suntan lotion and suntan oil. In the late 1950s it originated the CoverGirl line of cosmetics, notable for using Noxzema's medicated ingredients. The company diversified again when it bought the Lestoil heavy-duty multipurpose cleanser product in 1960. The company changed its name to Noxell Corporation in 1966. Noxell continued to be owned during this time by the Bunting family; Bunting's son, G. Lloyd Bunting, Sr., assumed the management of the company, followed during 1973 by George L. Bunting, Jr., Dr. Bunting's grandson. In 1989 the Procter & Gamble purchased the Noxell Company in 1989, as part of a $1.4 billion merger; the company continued to operate as a subsidiary. In 1996, the company sold off the Lestoil brand to The Clorox Company, citing the need to focus on cosmetics and fragrances. Its television commercials for Noxzema Shave Cream by the William Esty Advertising Agency caused a sensation when model Gunilla Knutson asked men to \\"take it off, take it all off\\" (referring to facial hair). P & G sold the Noxzema brand to Alberto-Culver in October 2008. Alberto-Culver was subsequently bought by the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever on September 27, 2010 for $US3.7 billion.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-27/unilever-agrees-to- buy-chicago-based-alberto-culver-for-3-7-billion-cash.html In 2016 the Noxell Company headquarters are located in a plant in the Baltimore suburb of Hunt Valley, Maryland; the facility also houses the cosmetics division of Procter & Gamble. This plant produces products for the CoverGirl, Max Factor and Olay brands, but Noxzema branded products are no longer produced there.

He was born in South Korea and has been living in America since the mid-1970s. Il Lee is best known for his ballpoint pen artwork; large-scale abstract imagery on paper and canvas. He also creates artwork in a similar vein utilizing acrylic and oil paint on canvas. Exhibitions of Il Lee's artwork have been held in Seoul, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Paris, New Delhi, Mexico City, and numerous cities across the United States. The New York Times has described Lee's ballpoint artwork as \\"deceptively casual; sweeping, rhythmical abstractions in blue.\\" Early life Il Lee was born in Seoul, South Korea, in 1952. His family originates from the mountains of North Korea, who made their way to South Korea in the years prior to the Korean war. His father studied architecture and engineering, but was unable to pursue it due to the outbreak of war. Lee has five siblings, and describes his family as \\"big\\" for his generation. Lee received his B.F.A. (painting) in 1976 from Hongik University, a Korean school said to be \\"Western oriented.\\" His paintings during the late-1970s were oil on canvas, presented as \\"geometric abstraction.\\" The artist himself later described some of those works as \\"labor-intensive.\\" Lee then moved to America; first to Los Angeles, then to New York, where he earned his M.F.A. from the Pratt Institute in 1982. His artwork went through natural changes upon arriving in New York ‚Äî \\"because I was in New York,\\" as he has reflected ‚Äî adding he may have \\"wanted to wash away the processes of the past.\\" Lee remained in New York. Artwork Lee began working with ballpoint pens during his time at Pratt in the early 1980s. He studied etching as his minor at Pratt, and the sharp needles became a preferred tool. The sharpness of its line interested him enough to continue pursuing it through other avenues. Lee participated in the group exhibition \\"Korean Drawing\\" at the Brooklyn Museum in 1981, introducing his ballpoint drawings. Those earlier works were all drawn on paper, but Lee soon began to work on large, primed canvases. The artist spends weeks, sometimes months, applying layer upon layer of ink to each artwork. Linework is built-up through a \\"scribbling\\" technique reliant upon the \\"speed, spin, and angle\\" of his pen in repetitive motions, sometimes becoming so dense that the line-work becomes a flat field of ink. The thicker layers can appear coagulated on the surface of the paper or canvas, with the dried ballpoint ink giving off a shiny purplish-blue hue. When working with paint on canvas Lee utilizes empty pen casings and other tools such as bamboo sticks, scribbling in the same gestural manner onto a wet surface layer to reveal colors underneath ‚Äî an inversion of his ballpoint method. Content & Interpretation Il Lee's artwork is categorized by some as minimalist in content, but has also been described as ‚Äúdeceptively casual,‚Äù with more work going into each piece than immediately apparent. The repetitive quality of Lee's swirly strokes has been likened to effects associated with the common spirograph. Comparisons to geographic features are also common, setting Lee's abstractions apart from \\"merely decorative\\" counterparts. Reviewers point out hints of mountain ranges evoking panoramic landscapes and rocks emerging from an imagined mist. Undefined forms appearing in works such as MMC-081 have also been interpreted as organic overgrowth or vines. Il Lee attaches no descriptive titles to his artwork. Instead, the artist uses his own system of letters and numbers to catalogue his work. Successive numberings such as SBK-089, SBK-0810, and SBK-0811 infer a sequence of related output. A pair of modestly-sized works on canvas from 2012 hint at a method to Lee's system of titles; paint combinations of white-over-red and white-over-blue are titled WR-1201 and WB-1201, respectively. Dimensions of Lee's works on paper range from conventionally-sized up to impressively proportioned; some occupying a full wall. Lee uses the largest paper available; rolls with a 60-inch width allow him to create lengthy artwork. One of Il Lee's most \\"ambitious\\" ballpoint artworks measures 50-feet wide, and reportedly required over 400 pens during nearly three months of the artist's attention. His paintings on canvas reach similar scale. Lee has stated that producing small works can sometimes be \\"limiting,\\" adding that producing larger works provides certain satisfaction. Il Lee describes his creative process as \\"intuitive,\\" a term he came to identify with during his time at Pratt. He prefers approaching his work with an empty mind and minimal forethought. While drawing, he directs his focus to the surface before him, allowing his gestures freedom while maintaining control. Reception Art critic Edward Leffingwell writes in Art in America of Il Lee's 2006 solo exhibition at Art Projects International, > \\"There is an almost palpable liquidity in the dense, indigo heart of Il > Lee‚Äôs recent production. Using common ballpoint pens, he locates a point or > describes an arc or line on his paper or canvas support. The ink becomes > increasingly fluid with the heat of his hand as he works, and an > increasingly solid form ventures its incessant spread, as though the artist > were determined to obliterate the ground entirely. At the edges, the sweep > of line slows and reclaims its identity as a distinct part among the skeins > of marks. Yet the work has come as close to painting as drawing can.\\" Reviewing Il Lee's 2007 mid-career retrospective at the San Jose Museum of Art, Kenneth Baker of the San Francisco Chronicle writes, \\"We might read in Lee‚Äôs piece an echo of the ancient divisions of reality into heaven and earth, or light and darkness. But the seemingly automatic action of his hand, tempered by the hard boundary above and the thinning of marks below, asserts itself everywhere as something that outraces any intellectual agenda. A broad program seems to have guided the making of this piece, and most of the others on view. Consciousness of the working surface‚Äîhow to divide it, how to apportion the weight of marking‚Äîappears uppermost. He leaves us to decide whether the apparent effects of light, mood and atmosphere arise more from his process or from our desire to see meaning in it.\\" Benjamin Gennocchio reviewed Il Lee's 2007 solo exhibition at the Queens Museum for The New York Times, noting the \\"unexpected suggestiveness\\" of Lee's artwork and describing the \\"simple, minimal forms\\" as \\"instinctively seductive.\\" While The New Yorker states that Il Lee has \\"mastered his medium.\\" Explaining that, \\"He knows how the ink will warm to produce a free-flowing line; he‚Äôs learned how to build up shadow and leave room for light. His works, which integrate Sol LeWitt-style minimalism and sumukhwai, an Asian ink-painting tradition, range from small studies to a new, fifty-foot-long work on paper that looks like an abstract meditation on a mountain range. Lee‚Äôs bent toward geometric abstraction and his slow accumulation of marks and lines suggest a freehand version of Spirograph suffused with Zen-like grace.\\" In a review of Il Lee's 2010 solo exhibition at the Crow Collection in Dallas, Texas, D magazine's Lucia Simek reported that \\"calm and frenzy lay down together\\" in Lee's artwork, which \\"harness so much power, through such effort, so quietly.\\" In The New York Times 2013 review of Extreme Drawing at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Martha Schwendener writes, \\"'Ballpoint Pen Drawing Since 1950,' features work by nearly a dozen artists created with the humble ballpoint pen‚Ä¶ Here you have ballpoint masters like Il Lee, whose abstract 'BL-120' (2011) uses the pen‚Äôs minute hatching capabilities, as well as the shininess of its ink, to full effect‚Ä¶\\" Notable Exhibitions * 2017 Solo exhibition, Suddenly a Knife: New Paintings by Il Lee, Art Projects International, New York * 2016 Solo exhibition, Il Lee: New Paintings / 40 Years in New York, Art Projects International, New York * 2016 Group exhibition, First Hand: Architects, Artists, and Designers from the L.

The track has two breaths in quick succession at the start of the song, intended to create a tone of fear and loathing. It is known among other AC/DC songs for its slow blues rhythm, ominous lyrics, as well as its controversy stemming from its association with the Richard Ramirez serial killings in 1985. At the end of the song, lead singer Bon Scott mutters, \\"Shazbot! Nanu nanu!\\", two phrases used by Robin Williams in his character of Mork on the popular sitcom Mork and Mindyhttps://www.songfacts.com/facts/ac-dc/night-prowler. \\"Night Stalker\\" controversy In June 1985, a highly publicized murder case began revolving around Richard Ram√≠rez, who was responsible for more than 15 brutal murders as well as rapes and attempted murders in Los Angeles. Nicknamed the \\"Night Stalker\\", Ram√≠rez was a fan of AC/DC, particularly the song \\"Night Prowler\\". Police also claimed that Ram√≠rez was wearing an AC/DC shirt and left an AC/DC hat at one of his crime scenes. During the trial, Ram√≠rez shouted \\"Hail Satan!\\" and showed off the pentagram carved into his palm. The incident brought extremely bad publicity to the band, whose concerts and albums were suddenly campaigned against by parents in Los Angeles County. On VH1's Behind the Music on AC/DC, the band claimed that while the song had taken on a murderous connotation by Ram√≠rez, it is actually about a boy sneaking into his girlfriend's bedroom at night.

He has done more than fifty ballet productions. Eifman was born in Siberia, where his engineer father had been assigned to work in a tank factory. In 1953, the family moved to Kishinev, Moldavia. Eifman graduated from the Kishinev Ballet School in 1964. He performed as a dancer with the Kishinev Opera and Ballet Theatre; and went on to study choreography at the Leningrad Conservatory, where his teacher was choreographer Georgi Aleksidze. Eifman graduated from the Leningrad Conservatory in 1972. He then became a ballet master at the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet, from 1972-1977. In 1977, he received permission to found his own company, originally known as Leningrad Theatre of Contemporary Ballet. The troupe was known by various names, but today its official title is St. Petersburg State Ballet Theatre of Boris Eifman, or simply Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg when on tour. In addition to choreographing for his own company, Eifman has created ballets for the Maly Theatre of Opera and Ballet, the Kirov Ballet, the Bolshoi Ballet, Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, and New York City Ballet, among others. He has also made dances for film and television. Eifman's family was required to move from Kharkov to Siberia during World War II. Though conditions in Siberia were hard, the move saved their lives. The Eifmans are Jewish; and the Nazis killed his father's family in Kharkov and Kiev. In Siberia, they lived in a \\"pit\\" with six rooms that housed six-ten families. \\"If the Government did not build real housing it was not because of money, but because people were not treated like people, but like cattle,\\" Eifman says. After the family moved to Moldavia, Eifman began studying ballet and folk dance, from the age of seven, with the Young Pioneers. His parents initially opposed his desire for a dance career, but he began to experiment with choreography as a teenager. Eifman's interest in dramatic subjects for his choreography places his work in a long- standing Russian tradition. This tradition dates back to the 18th century, and the foundation of the Russian school of ballet by disciples of Jean-Georges Noverre. Eifman has said, \\"the type of philosophical theater that I am working to create was not born in the Soviet Union...That's an idea that belongs to Noverre.\\" The choreographer has stated that his work for his own company can be divided into three periods: \\"the Soviet period, the perestroika era, and the last 10 years.\\" During the first period, he worked mostly without government subsidy and was subject to strict censorship. In spite of these restrictions, however, he won a popular following by choreographing to rock 'n roll music (Pink Floyd) and dared to address controversial themes. The authorities suggested that he emigrate, but he did not wish to leave St. Petersburg. During the second period, which began with his 1987 ballet The Master and Margarita and overlapped with perestroika, Eifman enjoyed more artistic freedom. His company made its first international tour, to Paris, in 1989. The third period began in 1996, when impresario Sergei Danilian approached him leading to the Eifman Ballet's US debut in 1998.

She is the fifth ship to carry that name, and the 46th destroyer of a planned 75-ship class. Bainbridge is named in honor of Commodore William Bainbridge, who as commander of the frigate distinguished himself in the War of 1812 when he and his crew captured , a 38-gun fifth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy. Since her commissioning in 2005, Bainbridge has been active in the Mediterranean Sea, but most of the attention she has garnered has been as a result of the failed hijacking attempt of the U.S.-flagged freighter by Somali pirates in April, 2009, which ended with the release of the vessel's master, Captain Richard Phillips, on 12 April 2009. After crewmen of the captured cargo vessel managed to retake the ship, the pirates retreated, taking the ship's master hostage in a lifeboat. Bainbridge, , and shadowed the pirates, and with FBI assistance attempted negotiations for the safe return of the captive captain until U.S. Navy SEAL snipers resolved the situation with deadly force. The story of this incident was turned into the 2013 motion picture titled Captain Phillips, starring Tom Hanks. Bainbridge was portrayed by sister ship .  Construction  Bainbridge is one of 75 authorized Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers, and is classified as a member of the Flight IIA‚Äìclass variation that incorporate the 5\\"/62 caliber gun mount, an improvement over the previous /54 caliber gun mounts on the earlier Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. In addition to her guns, Bainbridge carries over 100 missiles of various types aboard two separate Mk 41 VLS magazines. Her superstructure features the AN/SPY-1 radar indicative of the Aegis combat system, which allows the destroyer to track over 100 targets simultaneously. (Owing to the presence of the Aegis system, Bainbridge and her sisters are sometimes incorrectly referred to as Aegis-class ships.) She is also equipped with the Remote Mine-hunting System (RMS),AN/WLD-1 ‚Äì Remote Minehunting System.

Bainbridge was floated from drydock and christened on 13 November 2004 at Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, sponsored by Susan Bainbridge Hay, Commodore William Bainbridge's great-great-great- granddaughter. She was commissioned on 12 November 2005, with Commander John M. Dorey commanding in Port Everglades, Florida.  History  ScanEagle UAV, Bainbridge and the Maersk Alabama lifeboat, 9 April 2009.

While on deployment under SNMG-1, they visited various ports across the Mediterranean such as Valletta, Malta; A Coru√±a, Spain; Istanbul, Turkey; Crete, Athens, Greece; as well as Port-Louis, Mauritius; Port Victoria, Seychelles in the Indian Ocean. On 8 April 2009, Bainbridge was dispatched in response to a hostage situation in which Somali pirates had seized control of an American-flagged cargo vessel, . The crew of Maersk Alabama were able to get to safety, after their captain had been taken hostage by the pirates. He was taken to and held on a lifeboat, and refused release in an unsuccessful attempt to exchange him for a pirate the ship's crew had captured. The destroyer shadowed and later encircled the Somali pirates during the standoff, at which time the pirates and Bainbridge began negotiating for the safe release of the captive captain. On 12 April 2009 Captain Phillips was freed‚Äîreportedly in good condition‚Äîduring a US Navy SEAL team assault. Three of the Somali pirates were killed by US Navy SEAL sharpshooters aboard Bainbridge, and one was captured. In January 2014, Bainbridge completed a six-month deployment to Sixth Fleet and returned to her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia. Upon returning to Norfolk, Virginia, in December 2015 following another deployment with the United States 6th Fleet, an investigation was conducted that resulted in the three senior commanders being removed from duty. In a press release, a spokesperson says the Navy investigated Commander Sean Rongers for allegedly allowing gambling and storing fireworks on the ship, and for \\"poor program management and a poor command climate.\\" The Navy also fired the ship's former Executive Officer, Commander Brandon Murray, and Command Master Chief Richard Holmes. Commander Martin \\"Marty\\" Robertson assumed command on 8 April 2016. In the 13 June 2019 Gulf of Oman incident, Bainbridge responded to a distress signal from , a Japanese oil tanker which caught fire after an apparent explosion while transiting the Gulf of Oman. According to US Defense officials, Bainbridge picked up all 21 crew members who had been rescued by a tugboat.

Anecdota graeca (1814) Another work of Phrynichus, not mentioned by Photius, but perhaps identical with the Atticist mentioned by Suidas, the Selection () of Attic Words and Phrases, is extant. It is dedicated to Cornelianus, a man of literary tastes, and one of the imperial secretaries, who had invited the author to undertake the work; it is a collection of current words and forms which deviated from the Old Attic standard, the true Attic equivalents being given side by side. The work is thus a prescriptive and reforming lexicon antibarbarum, and is interesting as illustrating the changes through which the Greek language had passed between the 4th century B.C. and the 2nd century A.D. Editions of the Eklog√™, with valuable notes, have been published by C. A. Lobeck (1820) and W. G.

(\\"Hydrogen bonds\\" in the top image are exaggerated by artifacts of the imaging technique.) NC-AFM imaging of the molecular self-assembly process of 2-aminoterephthalic acid molecules on calcite(104). Molecular self-assembly is the process by which molecules adopt a defined arrangement without guidance or management from an outside source. There are two types of self-assembly. These are intramolecular self- assembly and intermolecular self-assembly. Commonly, the term molecular self- assembly refers to intermolecular self-assembly, while the intramolecular analog is more commonly called folding. Supramolecular systems Molecular self-assembly is a key concept in supramolecular chemistry. This is because assembly of molecules in such systems is directed through non-covalent interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, hydrophobic forces, van der Waals forces, pi-stacking interactions, and/or electrostatic) as well as electromagnetic interactions. Common examples include the formation of colloids, biomolecular condensates, micelles, vesicles, liquid crystal phases, and Langmuir monolayers by surfactant molecules. Further examples of supramolecular assemblies demonstrate that a variety of different shapes and sizes can be obtained using molecular self-assembly. Molecular self-assembly allows the construction of challenging molecular topologies. One example is Borromean rings, interlocking rings wherein removal of one ring unlocks each of the other rings. DNA has been used to prepare a molecular analog of Borromean rings. More recently, a similar structure has been prepared using non-biological building blocks. Biological systems Molecular self-assembly underlies the construction of biologic macromolecular assemblies and biomolecular condensates in living organisms, and so is crucial to the function of cells. It is exhibited in the self-assembly of lipids to form the membrane, the formation of double helical DNA through hydrogen bonding of the individual strands, and the assembly of proteins to form quaternary structures. Molecular self-assembly of incorrectly folded proteins into insoluble amyloid fibers is responsible for infectious prion-related neurodegenerative diseases. Molecular self-assembly of nanoscale structures plays a role in the growth of the remarkable Œ≤-keratin lamellae/setae/spatulae structures used to give geckos the ability to climb walls and adhere to ceilings and rock overhangs. Protein multimers When multiple copies of a polypeptide encoded by a gene self-assemble to form a complex, this protein structure is referred to as a multimer.Crick FH, Orgel LE. The theory of inter-allelic complementation. J Mol Biol. 1964 Jan;8:161-5. doi: 10.1016/s0022-2836(64)80156-x. PMID: 14149958 Genes that encode multimer- forming polypeptides appear to be common. When a multimer is formed from polypeptides produced by two different mutant alleles of a particular gene, the mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity than the unmixed multimers formed by each of the mutants alone. In such a case, the phenomenon is referred to as intragenic complementation.Bernstein H, Edgar RS, Denhardt GH. Intragenic complementation among temperature sensitive mutants of bacteriophage T4D. Genetics. 1965;51(6):987-1002. JehleJehle H. Intermolecular forces and biological specificity. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1963;50(3):516-524. doi:10.1073/pnas.50.3.516 pointed out that, when immersed in a liquid and intermingled with other molecules, charge fluctuation forces favor the association of identical molecules as nearest neighbors. Nanotechnology Molecular self-assembly is an important aspect of bottom-up approaches to nanotechnology. Using molecular self-assembly the final (desired) structure is programmed in the shape and functional groups of the molecules. Self-assembly is referred to as a 'bottom-up' manufacturing technique in contrast to a 'top-down' technique such as lithography where the desired final structure is carved from a larger block of matter. In the speculative vision of molecular nanotechnology, microchips of the future might be made by molecular self-assembly. An advantage to constructing nanostructure using molecular self-assembly for biological materials is that they will degrade back into individual molecules that can be broken down by the body. DNA nanotechnology DNA nanotechnology is an area of current research that uses the bottom-up, self-assembly approach for nanotechnological goals. DNA nanotechnology uses the unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information, to make structures such as complex 2D and 3D lattices (both tile-based as well as using the \\"DNA origami\\" method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. These DNA structures have also been used as templates in the assembly of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins. Two-dimensional monolayers The spontaneous assembly of a single layer of molecules at interfaces is usually referred to as two-dimensional self-assembly. One of the common examples of such assemblies are Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers and multilayers of surfactants. Non-surface active molecules can assemble into ordered structures as well. Early direct proofs showing that non-surface active molecules can assemble into higher-order architectures at solid interfaces came with the development of scanning tunneling microscopy and shortly thereafter. Eventually two strategies became popular for the self-assembly of 2D architectures, namely self-assembly following ultra-high-vacuum deposition and annealing and self-assembly at the solid-liquid interface. The design of molecules and conditions leading to the formation of highly-crystalline architectures is considered today a form of 2D crystal engineering at the nanoscopic scale.

Family background  His parents had arrived in Fiji as indentured labourers abroad the S.S. Ganges on 21 February 1913 and were sent to work for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR) estate at Rakui in Navua on the eastern side of the island of Viti Levu. After five years, his parents became \\"free\\" and moved to a village outside Navua and continued working for the CSR but under better conditions. They were also able to grow their own cash crops and sell to the indentured labourers.  Early life  Narain was the second child, born during the second year of his parents' life as free labourers in Fiji. His father later found work as a construction worker in Suva, where Narain was also introduced to the tools of the construction trade. After the birth of his third child, Narain's father developed a passion for gambling. He lost all his savings and also owed a great deal of money to others. To get away from his creditors, he decided to return to India, intending to find work there, save enough money and return. After the departure of his father, his mother gave birth to her fourth child and struggled to look after her children. While on a visit to the Levuka, on the island of Ovalau, she met and married Latchman Naidu and moved to Koro island. Naidu had set up a small business in Koro, buying and selling tobacco and trading in other small goods. Relations between Narain and his stepfather were not always good, so when he was sent to hospital in Levuka for a knee ailment, he stayed on at his recently married sister's place. Narain was ten years old then and started attending the local mission school. Through the wife of the local dentist who had connections with the school, Narain was able to get employment in the surgery. When the dentist moved to Suva, Narain went with them and for two years worked full-time at their home as houseboy and at the surgery. After two years in Suva his stepfather took him back to Koro, and he was put to work on a European's estate. When the owner was taken ill, Sathi was given charge of the estate. His mother died during the same year aged only 36.  Return to Suva  The recurring knee problem gave Narain the chance to return to Suva for treatment. He found employment as carpenter in the Colonial Government. When his younger brother also came to Suva for medical treatment, the two moved into a house in Toorak, where Narain started building small artifacts for his neighbours. Soon, word of his carpentry skills spread and he was kept busy making household furniture. In no time at all he was carrying out extensions to houses and even building new houses. He married 14-year-old Rukhmani, while in Toorak.  As a businessman  After five years, working for the Government, he decided to set up his own business. He rented a building in Toorak and started building residential buildings and shops. As his business expanded, he moved to a new premises in Walu Bay. His big break came when he won the tender to build the Fiji Museum in 1953. Soon afterwards, he won other major contracts. By this time he had expanded so much that he was able to register his company as a limited liability company in December 1953.  Savusavu  He saw the opportunity and bought a copra plantation in Savusavu from William Edmund Willoughby-Tottenham, despite opposition from other European planters. As Savusavu expanded, he saw the need for and established a school, named Khemendra Bharatya School, after his son. He also donated land for a park, known as Narain Park.  Union Club  In 1946, Narain joined the Union Club, the only multi-racial club of its type in Suva. There he met some of the then and future leaders of Fiji, including Ratu Sukuna, Ratu Mara and Ratu Edward Cakobau. His fluency in the Fijian language and these initial contacts introduced him to other Fijian leaders such as Ratu Penaia Ganilau and Ratu George Cakobau. At the Union Club he was given the title of Tui Koro (Chief of Koro). In 1955, it came as no surprise when Narain Construction was awarded the contract to build the Native Land Trust Board building in Suva.  Political involvement  In 1956, Narain stood for the Suva City Council elections and won. In 1959 he accepted the nomination as an Indian nominated member to the Legislative Council. In his maiden speech he spoke about ways of assisting low wage earners, by giving them income tax deductions for medical expenses. When the Nausori Sugar Mill closed in 1959, he asked for assistance to be given in the form of income tax deductions for capital expenditure by farmers to change from sugar to other types of cultivation. He proposed assistance to coconut farmers by asking for tax not to be levied on the planting of coconuts but on the proceeds from the sale of copra.  Expanding business  From 1960 onwards the Narain Construction business expanded greatly and spread to all parts of Fiji. He acquired the established engineering firm of Bish Limited in 1960, a branch was opened in Lautoka and he was the first to build town houses in Suva. He won other major contracts: 480 housing units for the Housing Authority, a new hospital in Suva, Travelodge Hotel in Savusavu and the Narain Towers, a fifteen-storey, 72-unit complex in Suva. He even went into the shipping business but was not successful in it.  Later life  His wife had been institutionalised for a long time, and in 1969 Narain remarried. In 1970 on Fiji's independence, he was awarded the title of the Member of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), for which he travelled to London to receive the award from the Queen. In 1980 he received his knighthood and was Knighted by Princess Anne during the Tenth Independence Anniversary celebrations. In 1986, he had moved to Brisbane for rest and to be closer to his children but the coup in Fiji in 1987, made this move permanent. A few years later he was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the lever and died in Brisbane on 19 October 1989.

Its performers are part of a group of wandering entertainers and peddlers who pass through villages during the course of a year and offer to sing ballads, tell fortunes, sell amulets, perform acrobatics, charm snakes, weave fishnets, tattoo local people and mend pots. This ancient custom, which for centuries before radio, movies, and television provided knowledge of Hindu epics and local folk tales, not to mention news, spread to the most remote corners of the subcontinent. Tholu bommalata literally means \\"the dance of leather puppets\\" (tholu ‚Äì \\"leather\\" and bommalata ‚Äì \\"puppet dance\\"). The puppeteers comprise some of the various entertainers who perform all night and usually reenact various stories from Hindu epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata.  Performance details  The performance begins with a series of sung invocations and a line of ornate, strikingly stylized puppets pinned in overlapping fashion onto the sides of the screen. The puppets are mounted in the middle on a palm stem, extended to form a handle used to move the body of the puppet. Their articulated arms are moved with detachable sticks that have a small piece of string with a peg at the end, which slip into holes on the hands. Generally, one puppeteer manipulates all three sticks of a single puppet, holding the central handle stick in one hand and two arm-control sticks in the other. Often two to three puppeteers operate puppets on the screen at the same time, each one delivering the lines for his or her own puppet. As the players manipulate the puppets, placing them on the screen and then moving them away, they create the illusion of the figures suddenly materializing and then fading out. They also cause the figures to walk, sway, hop, and fly through the air. They can swivel a dancer's detachable head and manipulate her hands while keeping her hips swaying to create a remarkable illusion of twirling. The puppeteers accompany all the character's speeches with animated movement of the arms and hands, which they can flip over to create a three-dimensional effect. The swaying of freely dangling legs also adds to the feeling of animation. When several puppets are stationary on the screen at the same time, they can be pinned to the screen with date palm thorns. A puppet can be rapidly pinned with one or two of the long, thin thorns passed through perforations in a headdress or shoulder ornaments. Such puppets are still able to engage in animated conversation by means of the sticks moving their hands. Characters that engage in rough fighting, such as the monkey king Hanuman or the jesters, are often held from the hip, enabling them to be moved with greater control than by the central stick alone. Every few minutes throughout the performance, the action will be broken by the episodes of broad comic relief from the jesters speaking in a slangy, quirky style and engaging in slapstick antics. Some of these depend on a strong dose of scatological humor, puns or risqu√© allusions. Except for certain commonly used expletives, their language is not obscene, though sequences may be bawdy to a degree not observed in other popular forms of entertainment. Interspersed with spoken dialogue, verse passages in literary Telugu and even Sanskrit are sung with instrumental accompaniment. These occur especially in contexts of heightened emotion or important events, rather like the arias in European operas. The players serve as their own musicians and all members of the troupe know the music that accompanies the various passages.  Musical instruments  The musical instruments consist of a harmonium, a portable keyboard organ that sometimes serves only as a drone; a long, two-headed South Indian drum with tapering ends (mrudangam); strings of bells worn on the ankles and wrists; and pairs of finger cymbals. A wooden shoe with stilts is used to keep its wearer above the mud during the rainy season, and can be struck against schoolchildren's seating planks to create dramatic clacking and banging sound effects for fight scenes. The singing style and the conventions of vocal delivery that accompany tholu bommalata closely resemble the form of singing from an old-fashioned drama genre known as Satyabhamakalapam. Accompanied only by the drum and finger cymbals, the player sings raising his hand up to one ear, as if to listen to what he is singing. Puppets and cinema Comparisons of shadow plays to movies can be informative. The shadow play was an ingenious technology of animating pictures, developed centuries before the advent of the motion picture industry. Here was a method of enabling four or five people to bring a hundred or more colorful mythological characters to life in the most remote village, all accompanied by virtuoso singing, contagious rhythms, and dramatic sound effects. The characters' costumes were elaborate, with swirling sashes and ornate necklaces and garlands, all cut to let points of light glisten in intricate patterns. Puppet making Three types of skins have been used to manufacture puppets: antelope, spotted deer and goat. Antelope skins are reserved for making a limited number of auspicious characters, such as the gods and epic heroes. Deer skin, noted for its strength and resistance to rough handling, is employed in the figures of the warrior Bhima and the ten- headed demon king Ravana. All other puppets are typically made from goat skin, readily available locally. Most puppets are made from a single skin, though some require more. At least four skins are necessary for Ravana ‚Äì one for his body, one for his legs, and one to make each set of five arms. Current state of affairs The shadow play has been only one set of techniques for dramatizing the vastly rich Hindu epics. It has now been superseded by motion pictures and television, which have reinvigorated the epics for the electronic age. But the shadow play was a brilliant innovation, one whose visual artifacts hold clues to the history of South Asian art and drama and deserve to be preserved for the delight of generations to come.

This disorder is more prevalent during REM sleep, however some studies have documented catathrenia during NREM sleep. The term catathrenia originates from the Greek kata (below) and threnia (to lament) and describes a rare condition which occurs during sleep being characterized by monotonous irregular groans also known as nocturnal groaning. Multiple studies have described nocturnal vocalisation among animals and have also reported some cases in humans, especially in patients with Parkinson's disease. The nocturnal vocalisation can be groaning, moaning, or different sounds produced while asleep, the most encountered being catathrenia and sleep talking (somniloquy). The duration of the groaning sound varies from two to 49 s and it is known to appear more often during expiration REM sleep than in NREM sleep. Catathrenia is distinct from both somniloquy and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The sound is produced during exhalation as opposed to snoring, which occurs during inhalation. It is usually not noticed by the person producing the sound but can be extremely disturbing to sleep partners. Bed partners generally report hearing the person take a deep breath, hold it, then slowly exhale; often with a high-pitched squeak or groaning sound. Catathrenia typically, sometimes even exclusively, occurs during REM sleep, although it may also occur to a lesser degree during NREM sleep. Catathrenia begins with a deep inspiration. The person with catathrenia holds her or his breath against a closed glottis, similar to the Valsalva maneuver. Expiration can be slow and accompanied by sound caused by vibration of the vocal cords or a simple rapid exhalation with no sound . Despite a slower breathing rate, no oxygen desaturation usually occurs. Certain side effects include sore throat, fatigue, and dizziness. There is debate about whether the cause is physical or neurological, a question that requires further study. While some speculate about a direct correlation to high anxiety and stress or the concept that catathrenia is purely psychological, there is only anecdotal evidence of either proposed cause.  Classification  Catathrenia has been defined as a parasomnia in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders Diagnostic and Coding Manual (ICSD-2), but there is debate about its classification. Importantly, in the latest version of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3), catathrenia has been included in the category of respiratory disorders, and thus it has been removed from the parasomnia category, as it was in the second version of the manual; nevertheless, a debate about the nature and classification of the disorder, still exist.Iriarte, J., Campo, A., Alegre, M., Fern√°ndez, S., & Urrestarazu, E. (2015). Catathrenia: respiratory disorder or parasomnia?. Sleep medicine, 16(7), 827-830.  Signs and symptoms  Because catathrenia itself is not considered life-threatening, there has been very little research done in the medical community, and many experts assume that the way to treat catathrenia is to treat the underlying sleep apnea, though there is no conclusive evidence published that catathrenia results from sleep apnea, and sleep studies show that not all people with catathrenia have been diagnosed with sleep apnea. While doctors tend to dismiss it as an inconvenience, people with catathrenia routinely describe the condition's highly negative effects on their daily lives including tiredness, low energy, dizziness and vertigo, work problems, relationship and social issues, and other physical and mental problems that could be associated with low sleep quality.  Common characteristics in reported cases  There are reported characteristics that are shared among patients with catathrenia. The main characteristics are: * Vocal sound: Sounds are usually a short or long vocalisation of the same letter (mainly an [a], [e], [o] sound or something in between). Contrary to snoring which has only formants, catathrenia has also harmonics and show more regular and similar patterns between nights. *Onset of groanings: Groanings tend to begin in childhood, adolescence or early adulthood. The ICSD-2 established the age of onset ranging from 5 to 36 years. *Consistency from night to night. *Appearing during expiration: The sounds show up exclusively on expiration American Academy of Sleep Medicine. International classification of sleep disorders. 3rd ed. Darien, IL: American Academy of Sleep Medicine; 2014. and are interrupted during inspiration. *Unawareness of the problem: Patients usually sleep normally despite the sounds and the effort to breath. However, bed partners and entourage are on one hand disturbed by the emitted noises during their sleep and on the other hand concerned about the pathological meaning of the disease. The latter highlights the importance of reassuring entourage about the benignity of the disease. *No predisposing factors: No clear predisposing factors or aetiology have been demonstrated. There are a few other similaritiesamongst people with catathrenia that have not yet been studied properly: * Many people with catathrenia mention that they also have some form of stress or anxiety in their lives. * People with catathrenia themselves do not feel like they are experiencing a sleep apnea; the breath-holding appears to be controlled through the unconscious. Oxygen desaturation during a catathrenia episode is usually negligible. * Many took part in sports activities during teens and twenties some which required breath-holding which included many types of sports such as swimming and even weight lifting. They find a certain level of comfort in breath-holding, and often do it while awake. * Observations have been made of instances of breath holding during daily activities that require concentration. * Some people with catathrenia recalled having lucid or stress dreams during their catathrenia episodes during their sleep. * Some people with catathrenia complain of having a painful chest upon waking from sleep.  Discrepancies among reported cases  * Sound duration: The duration of the sound varies among patients. While the ISCD-2 established limits between 2 and 49 s, authors have described other ranges including short duration as of 0.5 s. Review of reported cases indicates two types of patients whose produced sound can either be short lasting (0.5 to 1.5 s) or longer lasting (2 to 20 s). Nonetheless, it is not clear if the sounds are in fact single long noises fragmented by brief expirations. * Sound intensity: Patients show a large variability in sound intensity ranging from 40 dB to 120 dB. In addition, sounds can also be long and soft as well as short and loud. *Onset time of the noise during the night: The ISCD-2 established latency of noises after falling asleep ranging from 2 to 6 h. However, in some published cases the onset time of the noises is reported as being shorter (3 min ). *Association with respiratory disorders. *Response to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment: The response to CPAP treatment partly depends on respiratory disorders. Patients with respiratory dysrhythmia may show poor to no improvements. CPAP in combination with drugs may also obtain unsatisfactory results. For other patients there is an excellent response to CPAP treatment (e.g., for young women patients with catathrenia over a 5-year period, patient with OSA and pulmonary hypertension, and others ). *Predominance of REM or NREM: The predominance of REM or NREM sleep during which noises occurs varies from patient to patient. For some cases, a REM predominance has been reported whereas it is the opposite for others. Other reports indicated that sounds may occur at any time during sleep.  Epidemiology  It was in 1983 when the first case of catathrenia was described. The disorder is especially rare and many sleep specialists and otolaryngologists are still unfamiliar with this atypical sleep pattern. Catathrenia must be distinguished from moaning during epileptic seizures, central sleep apnea, sleep-related laryngospasm, snoring, and stridor. Since polysomnography alone is insufficient to correctly distinguish catathrenia from central sleep apnea, a video-polysomnography with audio recording is necessary to diagnose catathrenia and avoid mistakes. Despite the fact that the incidence of catathrenia might be underestimated due to misdiagnoses, an institution in Norway has found an incidence of 4 out of 1,004 (0.4%) among patients with sleep and/or wake problems over a 1-year period. A previous study in Japan found an incidence of 25 out of 15,052 (0.17%) among patients with sleep and/or wake problems over a 10-year period.Jaar O, Pilon M, Montplaisir J, Zadra A. What is nocturnal groaning (catathrenia)? - analysis of PSG data. Sleep. 2009;32(Abstract Suppl):A290‚ÄìA291. Management  Sleeping in a more upright position seems to lessen catathrenia (as well as sleep apnea). Performing regular aerobic exercise, where steady breathing is necessary (running, cycling etc.) may lessen catathrenia. Strength exercise, on the other hand, may worsen catathrenia because of the tendency to hold one's breath while exercising. Yoga and/or meditation focused on steady and regular breathing may lessen catathrenia. Some evidence indicate that continuous positive airway pressure can be an effective treatment for catathrenia:Iriarte, J., Alegre, M., Urrestarazu, E., Viteri, C., Arcocha, J., & Artieda, J. (2006). Continuous positive airway pressure as treatment for catathrenia (nocturnal groaning). Neurology, 66(4), 609-610.Ortega-Albas, J. J., Diaz, J. R., Serrano, A. L., & de Entrambasaguas, M. (2006). Continuous positive airway pressure as treatment for catathrenia (nocturnal groaning). Neurology, 67(6), 1103-1103. in a study, the subject using CPAP significantly decreased the sounds typically produced because of the disorder, which almost disappeared.

Location Matanzas is located in the north west of Cardenal Caro Province, O'Higgins Region, and forms part of the commune of Navidad, Chile. Is located 160 kilometres south of Santiago and 58 kilometres north of Pichilemu. History Matanzas was a famous harbour during the time of the colonization of Chile, and was the place where part of the Spanish army responsible for the occupation of Chile‚Äôs Zona Central disembarked. The place was also frequented by pirates. The name \\"Matanzas\\" (Spanish for ‚Äúslaughter‚Äù or ‚Äúkilling‚Äù) comes from the sea lion hunting and processing industry, which were used to provide oil and other goods. A local story tells of a visit from Sir Francis Drake, who disembarked and was well received in Matanzas. Another tells of a sunken Spanish galleon out off the coast.

Sometimes, as a result of immune system response to protect the retina, cells converge in the macular area as the vitreous ages and pulls away in posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). PVD can create minor damage to the retina, stimulating exudate, inflammation, and leucocyte response. These cells can form a transparent layer gradually and, like all scar tissue, tighten to create tension on the retina which may bulge and pucker, or even cause swelling or macular edema. Often this results in distortions of vision that are clearly visible as bowing and blurring when looking at lines on chart paper (or an Amsler grid) within the macular area, or central 1.0 degree of visual arc. Usually it occurs in one eye first, and may cause binocular diplopia or double vision if the image from one eye is too different from the image of the other eye. The distortions can make objects look different in size (usually larger = macropsia), especially in the central portion of the visual field, creating a localized or field dependent aniseikonia that cannot be fully corrected optically with glasses. Partial correction often improves the binocular vision considerably though. In the young (under 50 years of age), these cells occasionally pull free and disintegrate on their own; but in the majority of sufferers (over 60 years of age) the condition is permanent. The underlying photoreceptor cells, rod cells and cone cells, are usually not damaged unless the membrane becomes quite thick and hard; so usually there is no macular degeneration. Cause An Amsler grid, as it might be viewed by a person with very severe macular pucker. Most cases of Epiretinal membrane are milder and show much smoother curved lines. The source of the cells in epiretinal membranes (ERM) has been found to comprise glial cells, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, macrophages, fibrocytes, and collagen cells. These cells are found in varying proportions. Those from retinal breaks, previous retinal detachments, or cryopexy are composed mainly of dispersed RPE cells, while cells of glial origin predominate in idiopathic pathology. Laminocytes are the fundamental cell type in idiopathic ERMs. These cells are frequently found in small and dispersed numbers in eyes containing a PVD. The presence of retinal pigment cells invariably indicates proliferative retinopathy and is only seen in association with a retinal detachment or tear. The incidence of associated PVD range from 75-93%, and PVD is present in virtually all eyes with retinal breaks or retinal detachments and subsequent ERM formation. PVD can lead to retinal breaks that may liberate RPE cells that initiate membrane formation. Small breaks in the internal limiting membrane (ILM) after PVD also may provide retinal astrocytes access to the vitreous cavity, where they may subsequently proliferate. Many ERM also have ILM fragments that may be peeled separately. Finally, vitreous hemorrhage, inflammation, or both associated with a PVD also may stimulate ERM formation. Both sexes appear to be affected equally frequently. Diagnosis Epiretinal membrane is typically diagnosed by appearance with optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula. Features include a thickening of the nerve fiber layer, a serrated appearance to the surface of the retina just beneath a thickened layer of glial tissue at the retinal-vitreous interface. Prevention There is no good evidence for any preventive actions, since it appears this is a natural response to aging changes in the vitreous. Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) has been estimated to occur in over 75 per cent of the population over age 65, that PVD is essentially a harmless condition (although with some disturbing symptoms), and that it does not normally threaten sight. However, since epiretinal membrane appears to be a protective response to PVD, where inflammation, exudative fluid, and scar tissue is formed, it is possible that NSAIDs may reduce the inflammation response. Usually there are flashing light experiences and the emergence of floaters in the eye that herald changes in the vitreous before the epiretinal membrane forms. Treatment Surgeons can remove or peel the membrane through the sclera and improve vision by 2 or more Snellen lines. Usually the vitreous is replaced at the same time with clear (BSS) fluid, in a vitrectomy. Surgery is not usually recommended unless the distortions are severe enough to interfere with daily living, since there are the usual hazards of surgery, infections, and a possibility of retinal detachment. More common complications are high intraocular pressure, bleeding in the eye, and cataracts, which are the most frequent complication of vitrectomy surgery. Many patients will develop a cataract within the first few years after surgery. In fact, the visual distortions and diplopia created by cataracts may sometimes be confused with epiretinal membrane. Epidemiology This ocular pathology was first described by Iwanoff in 1865, and it has been shown to occur in about 7% of the population. It can occur more frequently in the older population with postmortem studies showing it in 2% of those aged 50 years and 20% in those aged 75 years. Culture In 1996, Spalding Gray (June 5, 1941 - ca. January 10, 2004), an American actor, screenwriter and playwright, released Gray's Anatomy, a film monologue describing his experiences dealing with a macular pucker and his decision to undergo surgery. In the 2011 film Paul, Ruth had Epiretinal membrane complicated by macular edema in her left vitreous cavity.

Gleichen's comital title, shared by his sisters, derived from his mother, who had received it from Ernst II, Duke of Saxe- Coburg and Gotha, shortly before her morganatic marriage to his father. Gleichen had been an hereditary estate of the Princes of Hohenlohe in Germany since 1631, and their father voluntarily used it as a comital title to place himself on the same social footing as his wife. But Edward was not entitled to any land or revenues derived from this dynastic property. On 15 December 1885, the Court Circular announced Queen Victoria's permission for Edward's mother to share his father's rank at the Court of St James's, and henceforth they were known as HSH Prince and Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. But the Queen did not extend that privilege to their children, although she confirmed use of their German style as count and countesses. On 12 June 1913 Edward was granted precedence before marquesses in the peerage of England (whilst his sisters were granted precedence before the daughters of dukes in the English peerage). Career Gleichen served as a Page of Honour to the Queen from 1874 to 1879. He joined the Grenadier Guards in 1881 and gradually rose through the ranks over the years, eventually becoming a Major General. He served in the short-lived Guards Camel Corps in the Sudan campaign in 1884‚Äì85 and with the Egyptian army in the Dongala campaign in 1896. In 1899‚Äì1900 he served in the Second Boer War in South Africa, and was mentioned in despatches for his actions during the Battle of Modder River 28 November 1899. In January 1900 he was appointed Deputy Assistant-Adjutant-General to the forces in South Africa. He was Sudan agent in Cairo from 1901 to 1903 with the local rank of Lieutenant-colonel, then Military Attach√© to Berlin from 1903 to 1906. He and Kaiser Wilhelm II fell out, and Gleichen was sent to be Military Attach√© in Washington D.C. from 1906 to 1907. He met the Wright brothers while in Washington and wrote a report on their aircraft, but also failed to form a relationship with U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt. He was Assistant Director of Military Operations from 1907 to 1911. He served in the First World War, commanding the 15th Brigade from 1911 to 1915, and then the 37th Division from 1915 to 1916. He was an Intelligence Bureau director at the Department of Information from 1917 to 1918. He served as Chairman of the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names from 1919. At court, the Count was appointed an Extra Equerry to King Edward VII in July 1901. He wrote a number of books, including: *With the Camel Corps up the Nile (1888) *With the mission to Menelik (1898) *The doings of the Fifteenth Infantry Brigade, August 1914 to March 1915 (1917) *London's open air statuary (1928) *A Guardsman's Memories (1932). He was the editor of: *Anglo-Egyptian Sudan: a compendium prepared by officers of the Sudan Government - Vol. I: Geographical, descriptive and historical. - 1905. Vol.II: Routes.- 1905. Suppl.: 1906 Change of title When King George V commanded his German relatives domiciled in Britain to Anglicize their names and titles in 1917, the Gleichens' 1913 precedence was reduced several grades to that of younger son/daughters of a marquess in the peerage of the United Kingdom. This was because only marquisal rank was conferred upon the King's nearer, heretofore princely relatives, the Tecks and Battenbergs. Although inexplicably allowed to retain their German surname, the Gleichens relinquished use of the comital title and on 12 September 1917 acquired the prefix of Lord or Lady, although this was not made hereditary for Edward's descendants as his countship had been. On 2 July 1910, Gleichen married Hon. Sylvia Gay Edwardes (a niece of the 4th Baron Kensington), who was a Maid of Honour to Queens Victoria and Alexandra. They had no children.

Traders from nearby places used to come to Vaipur market to sell and buy their wares. Vaipur chanda (market) used to function on Mondays and Thursdays every week. Vaipur was part of Alappuzha (Alleppey) district until the creation of Pathanamthitta District and Mallappally Taluk.  Religious Centres = Temples Vaipur is famous for the seven temples: Vaipur Mahadeva Temple, Kulangarakkavu Sree Bhuvaneswari Temple, Kottangal Sree Devi Temple,Kulathoor Major Devi Temple,Thricherpuram Sree Shankara Narayana Swami Temple, Sasthamkavu Ayyappa Temple, Keethrikka Sree Krishna Swami Temple.nearest temple 'anikkattilammakshethram' The four well-known Nair families are Kaimodathu, Mangalathu Tharavadu, Alancherril and Kolathu. The kaimodathu tharavadu members were the powerful kshatriya nair \\"Kaimal\\". All over in Kerala the Kaimal family members are less. The main branches of Kaimodathu tharavadu are Edavassary, Kulathunkal and Thumpooru. The Alancherril Nairs(the main branches are Edoor Pillais and [KARUMALIL]) migrated from Madapally near Changanacherry and their family deity is in Cheruvally Temple. The Kolathu Nairs migrated from the ancient Kolathu Nadu(Malabar). Vaipur is famous for the Temple Festivals: Vaipur Mahadeva Temple Utsavam (the most famous is the 5th Festival that is celebrated on the 5th day of the festival by \\"chettimukku\\"), Kulangarakkavu Kumbha Pooram, Kottangal Padayani, Kulathur Meena Pooram, Thricherpurathu Karkidaka Vavu Pooja, and the Mandala Poojas during the Sabarimala season. The Vaipur road has been declared as Sabarimala patha.  Masjids & Muslims  Vaipur has two famous Masjids: Vaipur Pazhayapallim Jama-Ath (Estd: 1185AD) and Puthanpally Jama-Ath (Estd: AD 1895). Vaipur Muslim Pazhayapalli was the first Masjid for 18 places (Kara) includes Erumely, Kanjirappally and Vaipur etc. Muslims in Vaipur are either Rawthers or Labbas (Rawthers and Labbas are following the Hanafi school of fiqh). The word Rawther is said to have come from the word Mauther, which means people in charge of elephants' and horses' divisions of the king's army. The myth says that, Rawthers originally belonged to Pandya Desam near Madurai in Tamil Nadu (currently Chennai). Few of the Rawther families are then migrated to different places of Kerala; including Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Kollam and Eduki districts and Malabar. Labba families (Amir Khadi's family, Vavar family) at Vaipur claimed to be the 14th or 15th line of descendants of Vavarswami, friend of Sabarimala Ayyappan. The descendants of Vavar Swamy are believed to be Vaidyas practicing the Unani (Greek) system of medicine. [Abdul Rasheed Musliar] from vaipur is holding the main priest position in Sabarimala Vavaru Temple; he is having about 40 years of parikarmi (additional priest) experience in Sabarimala vavar temple. \\"Vaipur Chandanakkudam\\" is a local festival celebrating on every Makaram 15th of Malayalam Calendar, this festival as part of the Perumpara UROOS and it is continuing for maintaining Hindu Muslim brotherhood.  Churches & Christian settlements  Vaipur had Christian/Nazrani settlements dating back to the 13th century. St. Mary's Church, Vaipur was established in AD 1212, according to the records of Changanacherry Archdiocese. The only Syrian Catholic churches that were contemporaneous with Vaipur St.Mary's Church, were Champakulam (Kalloorkad) St.Mary's (Estd:427 AD), Athirampuzha, St.Mary's (Estd AD 835),Changanaseri St. Mary's (Estd AD 1017), Kudamaloor St. Mary's (Estd: AD 1125). The Nazranis of Vaipur belonged to Niranam Church (which according to tradition was one of the 7 churches established by St Thomas in the first century AD). The Nazranis of Manimala, Vaipur and Kallooppara, had to travel to Niranam using the waterways of River Manimala. Later, the Kallooppara Church was established and Vaipur Christians used to be members of that Church until Vaipur pazhaya palli was established. Vaipur (Pazhaya Palli) is listed (along with Niranam, Kalloopara, Changanassery and Kanjirappally in the nearby places) among the 180 parishes that had representatives at the Synod of Diamper (Udayamperoor) in 1599, that was held by the Portuguese Archbishop Menezes of Goa to unite the Indian Syrian Christians/ Nazranis/ Saint Thomas Christians to the Latin Catholic Church of Rome and its practices. This later led to division of the Indian Christian church into mainly the Jacobite Orthodox Church and the Syrian Catholic Churches after the Koonan Kurisu Sathyam (Coonan Cross Oath) of 1653. After this period of dissension and division within the Christian community, the Christian communities of various denominations, appear to have migrated from Vaipur, to other places. The Catholics mostly migrated to Nedumkunnam and nearby places. Christians from Vaipur area settled to different locations of Malabar area. In the meantime more parishes were settled to nearby places namely Kulathur, Chunkappara etc. The Edoor Tharakans belonging to the Syrian Christian/Nazrani Community, were powerful traders and landowners in the area. They are reported to have originated from Kalikavu Illam, whose members migrated to Vaipur from either Kuravilangad or Nilackal. The Edoor tharavad, had 10 branches: 1) Edoor (Vaipur), 2) Karuthaparackal (Vaipur), 3) Kallooprayat (South Anicad), 4) Mecherimannil (Vaipur), 5) Cheranackal (Kottangal), 6) Edoor Marungottil (Vakathanam), 7) Plakizh (Eraviperoor) 8) Kozhimannil (Morani South Anicad), 9) Puthuparampil Peedika (Vaipur), 10)Kulathunkal (Anicad). Other major sub branches of these divisions are Kuppumadathil (Manimala), Akkattu(Manimala), Edoor Karuthaparackal family migrated to Nedumkunnam and formed the Thathakatt and Nechikatt families in Nedumkunnam. The Karathaparackal Nechikatt family history, records the family roots 250 years back to Thathakatt-Nechikatt families, settled in Nedumkunnam. Nedumkunnam temple and church had connections to the Vaipur Christian and Hindu communities.

Proponents claim that their hypothesis is scientific, that it challenges the dominant scientific model of evolution. This has been dismissed by scientific opposition as pseudoscience,National Academy of Sciences, 1999 Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, Second Edition and in the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District federal court case, United States District Judge John E. Jones III ruled that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature.Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, Case No. 04cv2688. December 20, 2005 Scholar Noah J. Efron wrote in 2014: Jewish organizations  A number of Jewish organizations have fought against the inclusion of intelligent design in the public school curriculum, generally on the basis that to teach intelligent design in public schools would be a violation of the separation of church and state. In 2005, Jeffrey Sinensky, general counsel for the American Jewish Committee, praised the court ruling in Kitzmiller v. Dover School District. Sinensky stated: \\"Intelligent design is not a scientifically accepted theory, but a religious theory similar to creationism, which has no place in the science classroom of a public school. Any discussion of creationism or intelligent design would be more appropriate in a history or comparative religion class, as opposed to a science curriculum.\\" According to the Anti-Defamation League, \\"The U.S. Constitution guarantees the rights of Americans to believe the religious theories of creation (as well as other theories) but it does not permit religious theories to be taught in public school science classes. This distinction makes sense, and is ultimately good for religion, because it leaves religious instruction to properly trained clergy and to parents (where religious education properly belongs), it keeps government out of religious controversies, and it ensures that public school classrooms remain hospitable to an ethnically diverse, religiously pluralistic country.\\" In a survey of doctors conducted under the auspices of the Jewish Theological Seminary, 83 percent of Jewish doctors agreed with the statement that intelligent design is \\"a religiously inspired pseudo-science\\" rather than a \\"legitimate scientific speculation\\" To Rabbi Brad Hirschfield, vice president the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership (CLAL), an interdenominational Jewish organization, the intelligent design theorists themselves have unscientific goals. \\"Excluding those Darwinians who understand their position to be a proof against the existence of a creator -- itself a kind of fundamentalist position -- the primary interest of evolutionary biology is the deepening of our understanding of life, regardless of the theological implications. The premise of intelligent design theory is that it can provide evidence that confirms the existence of a specific kind of creator. If it failed to do so, then not only would the theory be wrong, but the proponents of it would see themselves as having failed in their pursuit of knowledge and in their attempt to confirm what they already believe.\\" Reform Judaism In 2005, the 68th General Assembly of the Union for Reform Judaism passed a resolution, The Politicization of Science in the United States, in which it opposed the teaching of intelligent design in the schools: \\"Intelligent design proponents are increasingly, and with success, seeking to use public schools to advance this concept, suggesting that 'intelligent design' holds scientific merit equal to the theory of evolution. The overwhelming majority of the scientific community, which supports theories that are testable by experiment or observation, oppose treating intelligent design, which is neither, as scientific theory.\\" Conservative Judaism According to Jeffrey H. Tigay, writing in Conservative Judaism (the official publication of the Conservative movement), \\"a literal reading of the Bible, on which \\"creation science\\" implicitly insists, misses the point of the Bible itself, which seems uninterested in literal interpretation. Like poetry and certain kinds of prose, which sometimes speak in metaphors and symbols, the Bible as a whole does not intend these stories to be taken literally.\\" Rabbis have often expressed this opinion even while distinguishing their own theistic views of life from those of Darwinism. For example, to Rabbi Michael Schwab, a pulpit rabbi in the Conservative movement, \\"What Darwin sees as random, we see as the miraculous and natural unfolding of God‚Äôs subtle and beautiful plan.\\" However, Schwab disagrees with the intelligent design movement's claim, that the existence of God can be proven as \\"a practical scientific theory that has equal evidence in science as evolution.\\" Schwab writes, \\"We cannot prove God‚Äôs existence through science any more than we can prove that there is an afterlife in that manner. God's existence is not subject to empirical data, there is no experiment to be done in this matter of which the results can be replicated in the future.\\" Rabbi Steven Morgen, the rabbi of congregation Beth Yeshurun, a Conservative synagogue in Houston, Texas, asked his congregation, \\"So why do I, as a Rabbi, object to having our schools teach ‚Äúintelligent design‚Äù as part of the science curriculum when they teach the theory of evolution? Because it is not science. The scientific method of discovering \\"truth\\" involves developing an assumption (or hypothesis), and then attempting to prove or disprove that assumption by experiment and/or observation. There is no experiment we can create that will prove or disprove that an Intelligent Designer interfered in the natural progression of life on earth to create different organs or species of animals.\\" Morgan goes on to explain his own beliefs. \\"Can I describe how God was involved in this process? No. Can I prove that God was involved in this process? No. As I said, our beliefs are not science. They are not provable. But I believe that God was involved because even if we can explain scientifically how all this might have happened through the evolutionary process, it is still a miraculous world to me, and so I believe that whatever we discover scientifically to be \\"the way it happened\\" is how God made it happen. I believe that God not only created the Universe in this way, but that God continues to exist in our lives whenever we recognize God‚Äôs presence. God cares deeply about us and is there for us when we call upon our Creator.\\" Orthodox Judaism=Modern Orthodox Many leaders of Modern Orthodox Judaism expressed similar views about intelligent design. For example, Rabbi Dr. Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, the executive Vice President of the Orthodox Union told the daily Haaretz, \\"Intelligent Design calls to our attention the amazing complexity of the universe. That is descriptive science and should be part of all courses in biology and chemistry. However, the conclusion that such complexity is proof positive of a Creator, as Judaism or other religions understand such a creator, is faith, not science, and as such has no place in the curricula of the public schools in the United States, where separation of Church from State is a fundamental national premise.\\" Weinreb continued, \\"In a religious school, particularly in a Jewish school, I would advocate that evolution as understood by the scientific establishment be taught in courses of science, and that Intelligent Design be taught in courses of Jewish thought.\\" But there was some dissent at the Sixth Miami International Conference on Torah and Science, held in Miami, Florida, in December 2005. Moshe Tendler, an influential Orthodox rabbi and a professor of biology at Yeshiva University, urged his Orthodox scientific colleagues to examine the theory of intelligent design. Tendler attacked the idea that complex life could flow from \\"random evolution.\\" The following morning, an intelligent design proponent, William Dembski (a Professor of Philosophy at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and an evangelical Christian), sought to present evidence of design in nature. These addresses prompted a storm of protest from scientists at the conference, who besieged Dembski with so many questions that the next speaker on the agenda was unable to follow him. Journalist Mariah Blake reported that scientists who attended the conference, most of them observant Orthodox Jews, were generally critical of intelligent design. Nathan Aviezar, who teaches physics at Bar Ilan University in Israel commented, \\"The whole enterprise of science is to explain life without invoking supernatural explanations. Intelligent design is not science, it's religion, and it shouldn't be taught in science class.\\" However, local Orthodox Jewish high school students, bussed in to observe the conference, were more receptive. Nathan Katz, one of the conference organizers, commented that the enthusiasm some Orthodox Jews express for intelligent design reflects a growing alliance between traditional Jews and evangelical Christians. The two groups have found themselves on the same side of many culture war battles, and evangelicals have offered significant financial support for Israel. Katz explained, this has made Orthodox Jews \\"willing to listen to evangelicals on other issues.\\" = The anthropic principle = Nathan Aviezar, an Orthodox Jewish scientist, has promoted an alternative perspective within Orthodox Jewry on how God is involved in creation, the anthropic principle. \\"Unlike intelligent design, the anthropic principle operates within the framework of science. In other words, the anthropic principle does not claim that science is insufficient to explain the physical universe.\\" =The theological problems of intelligent design= Natan Slifkin, in his work The Challenge of Creation, condemns the intelligent design community as presenting a theologically problematic perspective of God, and which, is thus, surreptitiously very dangerous to religion.Slifkin, Natan, The Challenge of Creation, (New York: Yashar Books, 2006) page 288. Those who promote it as parallel to religion, he asserts, do not truly understand it. Slifkin criticizes intelligent design's advocacy of teaching their perspective in biology classes, wondering why no one claims that God's hand should be taught in other secular classes, such as history, physics or geology. He asserts that the intelligent design movement is inordinately concerned with portraying God as \\"in control\\" when it comes to things that cannot be easily explained by science, such as the bacterial flagellum and the blood-clotting system, but that he is not in control in respect to things which can be explained by scientific theory, such as planetary motion and the formation of the world. Slifkin challenges Johnson's statement that \\"God will have to retreat out of the cosmos,\\" because he asserts that a \\"complete explanation of the celestial bodies by astronomy, or an explanation of the formation of the mountains by geology, or of rain via meteorology, does not paint God out of the picture, but instead means that He works through science,\\" something that Johnson denies.Slifkin, Challenge, page 289 Slifkin concluded by emphasizing that intelligent design is no friend of religion, in that it \\"denies the role of God in 99% of the universe...and implies that He was only able to engineer processes that would accomplish 99% of His objectives. Postulating the intelligent design of organisms means postulating the unintelligent design of natural law.\\" This point is built on comments made by Kenneth Miller in his work, The Flagellum Unspun: Miller, Kenneth, \\"The Flagellum Unspun,\\" in Debating Design, (Dembski, William and Ruse, Michael, eds.)

Professional career=The draft and the minor leagues Standing at 5'11\\" tall and weighing 190 pounds, Walbeck was taken by the Cubs 192nd overall (eighth round) by the Cubs in the 1987 draft. Although his professional career-started off very well-he hit .314 in 51 games in 1987-he would eventually level out and become an average hitter. He was not much of a power hitter, nor did he consistently hit for a high average. His best minor league season was perhaps 1992, when he hit .301 with seven home runs and 42 RBI. He did try stealing bases seven times that year, but was caught every single time. The Major Leagues Walbeck made his Major League debut on April 7, 1993 at the age of 23 against the Atlanta Braves. His rookie season would not be very successful; he hit only .200 in 30 at-bats that season. Walbeck hit the first home run of his career that season, off Jos√© DeLe√≥n on April 18. To the Twins On November 24, 1993, the Cubs traded Walbeck (with Dave Stevens) to the Twins for pitcher Willie Banks. Although his 1993 stats were fairly unimpressive, Walbeck was the Twins' primary catcher in and . In 338 at-bats with the Twins in 1994, he hit .204. On April 27 of that year, he caught Scott Erickson's no-hitter. His batting average was better in 1995; he hit .257 in 393 at-bats. He began the season as the team's starter in , but hit only .223 in 65 games and was replaced by Greg Myers as the starter. Onto the Tigers, Part 1 On December 11, 1996, the Twins traded Walbeck to the Tigers for minor leaguer Brent Stentz. Although Raul Casanova was the everyday starter, Walbeck did see a fair amount of playing time in . In 47 games, he hit .277 with three home runs. He also spent 17 games in the minors, where he hit .305 in 59 at-bats. Off to the Angels On November 20, 1997, the Tigers traded Walbeck with Phil Nevin to the Angels for minor leaguer Nick Skuse. Mostly used as the team's starter in , Walbeck hit .257 with a career high six home runs (a total that would be matched in ).

Back to the minors Walbeck-who was signed by the Cincinnati Reds and then purchased by the Phillies in June 2001, playing a total of 107 games in the minors that season. He appeared in only one game for the Phillies in 2001, as a pinch hitter for pitcher Vicente Padilla. After 2001, he was again granted free agency and signed by the San Diego Padres. Before he could appear in a single regular season game with the Padres, though, he was traded back to the Tigers, on March 22, 2002.

Overall, he hit .233 with 28 home runs and 208 RBI in his 11-year career. He stole 13 bases and was caught 12 times. In 2109 at-bats (682 games), he walked 133 times and struck out 343 times. Of all catchers with at least 2000 plate appearances from 1990 to 2009, he had the worst career OPS (on-base plus slugging percentage). Managerial career After his retirement in 2003, the Detroit Tigers offered him the manager position of their low Class A affiliate, the West Michigan Whitecaps. In his first year, he guided the Whitecaps to the 2004 Midwest League title. The Whitecaps would again win the Midwest League championship in 2006. After the 2006 season, Walbeck left West Michigan to fill the vacant manager position with the Tigers' Class AA affiliate, the Erie SeaWolves, where he was named EL Manager of the Year. Baseball America named Walbeck the 2007 Minor League Manager of the Year, spanning all minor league levels. Additional accolades include 2006 Midwest League Manager of the Year, and Baseball America \\"Best Tools\\" Manager in 2005 and 2006. On November 7, 2007, Walbeck was hired by the Texas Rangers to be their third base coach . In addition to those duties, Walbeck also handled the catchers and coordinated spring training activities. Walbeck was fired at the end of the 2008 season. On December 19, 2008, Walbeck landed back in the minors, managing the Eastern League Altoona Curve. In 2010, Walbeck's Curve won the EL championship, and he was again named EL Manager of the Year, but the Pirates fired him after the playoffs. Walbeck was hired to manage the Rome Braves, the class-A affiliate of the Atlanta Braves for the 2011 season, but was fired on July 7, 2011 after compiling one of the worst records in the minor leagues.

The club is notable as one of the Founding Clubs of the DFB (Deutscher Fu√üball Bund or German Football Association) in Leipzig in 1900.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag __TOC__ History Germania was established 26 August 1894 as the first football club in the city and early on (1904) also formed an ice hockey department. In October 1897 the club helped found the Verbandes S√ºddeutscher Fu√üballvereine (Federation of South German Football Teams) and board member Fritz Seidenfaden served a term as head of the organization. Germania was also part of a local city circuit known as the Frankfurter Association Bund which existed at about the same time and included four other sides: Frankfurter Kicker and Viktoria 1899 ‚Äì who would later go on to form Eintracht Frankfurt ‚Äì Bockenheimer FC Germania 1899, and FC Nordend. They captured that league's first championship and enjoyed other successes including the 1904 Main Gau championship and a second-place finish in an international tournament staged at the World's Fair at Li√®ge, Belgium the following year. Germania established its own ground in 1906 where they played until the site was developed for housing. From 1910 to 1913, the club played in the Nordkreis-Liga (I), with limited success. In 1913 they joined gymnastics club Frankfurter Turnverein 1860 as that association's football department in an arrangement that helped the footballers develop and maintain a new home ground where the nation final would be contested in 1920 between 1. FC N√ºrnberg and Spvgg F√ºrth before 30,000 spectators. In the early 1920s, the club played in the Kreisliga Nordmain, winning the title there in 1921‚Äì22. A group of local clubs including 1.FC Sachsenhausen 03, Hellas 07, and Amicitia 1911 merged in 1922 to become VfL Sachsenhausen 03 which would in turn become part of Germania in 1933. In the period following World War I the team was very active in international friendlies playing notable sides such as perennial Hungarian title holders MTK Budapest, Switzerland's BSC Young Boys, Wiener AC out of Vienna, Austria, and Turkish champions Galatasaray. They also hosted important German clubs such as VfB Leipzig and made a visit to Sweden where they played the national side. The club became independent of Frankfurter TV in 1923, but stayed on friendly terms with them, continuing to make use of TV's ground. After the rise to power of the Third Reich, Germania, like most other organizations in the country, was subjected to manipulation as the Nazis worked to spread their ideas. In 1933 the club was forced into a union with VfL Sachsenhausen 03 to become VfL Germania 1894 and then put in place a right-thinking chairman. Through this period the play of the footballers improved and they moved up through the various levels of local competition until eventually making an appearance in the Gauliga S√ºdwest (Staffel Mainhessen), one of a number of top flight divisions established in a re-organization of German football under the Reich in 1933. Their turn in first division play was short-lived, however, and they quickly backslid after a poor showing. Following World War II occupying Allied authorities dissolved all organizations in the country, including sports and football associations, but allowed their re-establishment beginning in mid-1945: 1. FC Germania 1894 Frankfurt was the first club to re-gain its license within the American occupation zone in September that year. The club spent the 1946‚Äì47 season in the second-division Landesliga Hessen before returning to more local competition. The association re-assumed the name VfL Germania 1894 in 1947 as they went about the business of re-establishing the various sports departments that made up the club. The footballers spent the next decades playing on the local circuit until winning their way to the Landesliga Hessen-S√ºd (IV) in 1993 where they played as a lower table side until being relegated in 1997. Today the team plays in the Kreisliga-A Frankfurt (IX). The sports club also has a bowling department.

The cantonment was established in 1842 by the British colonial rulers as a hill station. Located 77 km from Shimla, 65 km from Chandigarh and 50 km from Panchkula, it still retains an old world charm. History The Kasauli distillery and brewery were set up in the late 1820s at Kasauli (before the town was established nearby) by Edward Abraham Dyer, father of Colonel Reginald Edward Harry Dyer of Jallianwala Bagh massacre. He brought with him, brewing and distilling equipment from England and Scotland. This equipment came by sailing ship as far up the Ganges river as possible, before being loaded onto ox drawn carts and taken up to the Himalayas via the route to Shimla. Some of the original equipment including the copper pot stills are still in use today. This is prepared from tap water Edward Dyer selected the location of his brewery/distillery due to the fine springwater available there and because the climate at this altitude was similar to the climate of Scotland. His stated ambition was \\"to produce a malt whisky as fine as Scotch whisky,\\" albeit from much higher highlands. Another reason for this location was that there was a ready market of British troops and civilians in Shimla and elsewhere in Punjab for his products. He started by making India Pale Ale and malt whisky from the Kasauli brewery and distillery. Later on, after the town of Kasauli was established and began using much of the springwater, the brewery was dismantled and moved to nearby Solan where it still operates today. However, the distillery remains at Kasauli and is the oldest operating distillery in Asia and one of the oldest whisky making distilleries in continuous operation anywhere in the world. Edward Dyer incorporated his company in 1855, following the full establishment of British East India Company rule over the Punjab with the annexation of Punjab in 1849. This brought the area under British law which included the incorporation of companies. The company was incorporated as Dyer Breweries Limited and it later merged with Meakin Breweries Limited to become Dyer Meakin Breweries Ltd. The company still exists today under the name Mohan Meakin Limited. Products Historically, the main whisky brand made by the Kasauli distillery was a well regarded single malt named \\"Solan No. 1\\" named after the nearby town of Solan. Solan No. 1 was the best selling Indian whisky for over a century until the 1980s. In recent years, it has seen a decline in its fortunes. Today it is struggling against many much bigger rivals, which are largely flavoured rums (distilled from sugar cane juice). It remains the only malt whisky made in the Himalayas. Today, Mohan Meakin's principal liquor brand is Old Monk rum, whiskies include Diplomat Deluxe, Colonel's Special, Black Knight, Summer Hall and Solan No. 1. The company also produces London Dry and Big Ben gins, and Kaplanski vodka.

A morbidly obese henchman hailing from Scotland, Fat Bastard serves Dr. Evil in his quest to destroy Austin Powers. The character is portrayed by Mike Myers. His extreme size and weight (1 metric tonne, according to Dr. Evil) endows Fat Bastard with massive strength. He exhibited this prowess in the sumo ring in the third movie. Fat Bastard is noted for his foul temper, his emotional monologues that culminate in flatulence, his vulgar, crude manners, and his unusual diet. These go as far as to include a cannibalistic taste for human infants and midgets, whom he gluttonously calls, \\"The other, other white meat\\". In Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, he boasts that he once ate a baby, and tries to refuse Dr. Evil's money for his services in exchange for getting to eat Mini-Me. He also has the same Scottish accent as Shrek (also voiced by Myers), whose movie was released in 2001, two years after The Spy Who Shagged Me (and a year before Goldmember in 2002). Appearances=Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me Fat Bastard had stolen Austin's mojo in 1969, as he is a guard in the facility, and has knocked out the other guards using bagpipes that spray gas, leaving Austin impotent in 1999. After seducing and sleeping with Fat Bastard, secret agent‚Äîand Austin's ally‚ÄîFelicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) places a homing device in his rectum. During this time with Felicity, Fat Bastard is also eating a whole chicken while in bed with her. However, the device is ineffective, lost and left in a toilet before he returns to Dr. Evil's island. However, traces of rare vegetables are found in a stool sample, enabling the island to be tracked down. Fat Bastard often declares himself \\"dead sexy\\", but he is really hiding his true feelings of rejection from society. During an assassination attempt against Austin and Felicity in 1999, Fat Bastard dresses as a package delivery man and literally breaks in through the front door. When Felicity asks if he is happy, Fat Bastard has an emotional breakdown, tearfully confessing \\"I eat because I'm unhappy, and I'm unhappy because I eat. It's a vicious cycle. Now if you'll excuse me, there's someone I need to get in touch with and forgive. Myself.\\" He then farts, which makes Austin and Felicity disgusted. Fat Bastard is slightly embarrassed and says \\"Sorry, I farted. It‚Äôs a long road ahead\\". He then changes his mind and decides to kill them both anyway. Before he can, Felicity incapacitates him by kicking Fat Bastard in the groin. He falls to the floor, shaking the whole room in the process. Austin Powers in Goldmember In the next film, Fat Bastard retires from being a henchman and relocates to Japan. There, he becomes a sumo wrestler and, despite trying to go straight, he still carries out the odd job for Dr. Evil. During his bathroom time, Foxxy Cleopatra and Austin sneak in using a disguise and catch him. Austin starts shouting to him \\"You really are a Fat Bastard\\"; \\"You know that hurts my feelings; I've tried going on a diet, you know\\", he replies. Fat Bastard then says he did the Zone diet, stating that \\"carbs are the enemy,\\" though the Zone Diet promotes equal amounts of carbs and protein and Fat Bastard probably meant the Atkins diet, which emphasizes low carbs. After tearfully telling Austin and Foxxy that he's happy as a sumo wrestler, he farts. Austin asks him if he soiled himself. Fat bastard replies \\"maybe\\" and laughs. He then jokes about how it sounded wet and tries to smell it. he is disgusted by how it smells, stating it smells like Carrots and throw up. By the end of Austin Powers in Goldmember, he has lost his excessive weight, crediting it to the Subway diet, even citing Jared Fogle as a hero. However, he points out that he still has a lot of excess skin, further noting the resemblance of his neck to a vagina. On the film audio commentary, Mike Myers says that Fat Bastard probably will not stay thin (as \\"Thin Bastard\\", as he called him) and would most likely return to his overweight state. Popular culture and DirecTV commercial * Beginning in June 2006, this character was in a DirecTV commercial with Mini-Me. The plot was that he was talking about how Mini-Me was looking good to eat, like in the movies (see above). Mini-Me thinks that he is crazy. He also uses two of his lines from the movie. His famous line in this commercial is \\"Come on, get in my belly!\\" * On an episode of Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue titled \\"In the Freeze Zone\\", the monster Freezard references Fat Bastard by saying \\"Get in my Belly!\\". One of the show's stars, Michael Chaturantabut, would make a cameo appearance in Austin Powers in Goldmember, as a gunman at the pool area. * On an episode of WWF SmackDown!

The mass retail action figures sold of the character had the name \\"Fat Man\\" on the box, even though the patch on his blazer clearly displayed \\"FB\\".

In 2020 it relocated to Chantilly, Virginia. It competes in the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference and has a high-profile athletic rivalry with Bishop O'Connell High School in Arlington. Paul VI opened for the 1983‚Äì84 school year, accepting freshmen and sophomore students only. The next year (1984‚Äì85), the school was open to freshmen through juniors, and 1985‚Äì86 saw the first senior class. The Diocese of Arlington purchased the school building, which was in a dilapidated condition, from George Mason University, which had owned it for about a decade. The structure had originally been Fairfax High School, which opened in 1936 and relocated to a new facility in January 1972. One wing of the building housed Alzheimer patients until the school's third year. During its first years, the school was ministered by five Oblates of St. Francis de Sales, who also taught classes and one of whom (Don Heet) served as the principal. The remainder of the faculty were lay teachers. The other ordained faculty were Father Robert Mulligan, O.S.F.S and Father John Lyle, O.S.F.S. In 2000, the school selected its first principal who was not from the De Sales order. Philip Robey was selected for this position, and stepped down seven years later. He was replaced by Virginia Colwell, a former English teacher at Paul VI. In 2020 the high school relocated to South Riding in Loudoun County, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The move had been planned prior to the pandemic. The team name \\"Panthers\\" was voted by student body during the school's first year. The original school colors were brown and gold until the 1999‚Äì2000 school year. The school moved away from brown in favor of black, which was considered more stylish by the student body. After the canonization of Pope St. Paul VI in October 2018, the school was renamed St. Paul VI Catholic High School to further honor its patron and namesake. 2001‚Äì2003 expansion On May 9, 2001, Bishop Paul S. Loverde of the Arlington Diocese led a group of civic and school officials at the groundbreaking for a new $6.5 million student activity center. It included a gathering space for the entire student body, three classrooms, gymnasium, locker rooms, weight room, movable stage used for athletic and stage equipment, offices, laundry facilities and concession stand. The expansion was the result of five years of planning and fundraising by the school to refurbish its grounds. After a generous grant from the Diocese of Arlington, school officials were able to make some needed repairs to the old building. Before actual construction began on the activity center in winter 2001, air conditioning was installed in the current building and the original locker rooms were torn down. The two-story addition was completed for the 2003‚Äì04 school year. This included the new gymnasium, locker rooms, computer lab, coaches' offices and a wrestling room.

Appointed exarch for the newly created Melkite diocese in the United States, Bishop Najmy served for two years before his death at age 70.  Biography  Justin Abraham Najmy was born on April 23, 1898. He joined the Basilian Aleppian Order, studied at the seminary at Deir- ech-Chir and at the Propaganda Fidei, and was ordained a priest in Rome on December 25, 1926. Moving to the United States, he served as pastor of St. Basil the Great Church in Central Falls, Rhode Island before his appointment as apostolic exarch by Pope Paul VI on January 27, 1966. The appointment of Najmy as exarch at first drew protest from the Melkite patriarch Maximos IV, because he and the Synod of the Melkite Church had chosen a different candidate, and the appointment, decided by the Sacred Congregation for the Eastern Churches, made the new Exarch subject to the Holy See, and only responsible to the Patriarch and the Synod in liturgical matters. On May 29, 1966, in a ceremony at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston, Najmy was consecrated a bishop by Athanasios Toutoungi, archbishop of Aleppo, his former seminary colleague, and received the title of titular bishop of Augustopolis- in-Phrygia. The following month he was formally enthroned as exarch. He established his episcopal see at the Church of the Annunciation in suburban Boston, which became the cathedral for the newly created Apostolic Exarchate of United States of America, Faithful of the Oriental Rite (Melkite). In the wake of the Six-Day War in June 1967, Najmy welcomed the bishops of Middle Eastern churches in the United States for a meeting in Boston.

Anton Vladimirovich Antonov-Ovseyenko (; 23 February 1920, Moscow, RSFSR ‚Äì 9 July 2013, Moscow, Russia) was a Russian historian and writer. (Antonov-Ovseyenko‚Äôs biography on the website of the Sakharov Center) Born on 23 February 1920, he was the son of a Bolshevik military leader Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko. In 1935, he joined the historical faculty of the Moscow State Pedagogical Institute. In 1938, he was expelled from Komsomol and the institute wherein, however, he was reinstated in the same year. He was arrested in 1940 and spent 13 years in labor camps. Antonov-Ovseyenko is best known for his biography of Lavrentiy Beria and he also wrote several books. Antonov-Ovseyenko operated a state museum on the Gulag, for which the Moscow administration provided a building in August 2001. When he died in 2013, he was still working two full days a week to continue documenting what he called \\"the evils of the Soviet era\\" and to help with plans for a new, larger space.

In his 40 seasons at Duke, Harris has broadcast 456 consecutive Duke football games (2015) and 1,358 Duke basketball games (2016). His 1,980 game career includes 41 ACC men's basketball tournament games, 126 NCAA men's basketball tournament games in 35 trips, 13 Final Four appearances, 11 national championship games and 5 NCAA Champion titles. Harris was inducted into the Stanly County Sports Hall of Fame in 1993. He was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2006. Harris was named the 2011 North Carolina Sportscaster of the Year by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association, winning for the third time, following wins in 1988 and 1991. Harris has said, \\"I'm a fan. A fan with a microphone.\\" On June 25, 2016, Harris received the prestigious \\"Order of the Long Leaf Pine\\" award from NC Governor Pat McCrory for 40 years of service to the state. Born in 1942,Harris grew up in Albemarle, North Carolina. Beginning in 1960, Harris attended North Carolina State University for two years before leaving college to work for Goodyear. He later returned to his hometown for a job selling insurance, where he began working part-time for WZKY, in 1967. Harris volunteered to provide coverage of local football for the station, which led to him being hired as a full-time sports announcer, as well as sports director for eight years. In 1975, Harris and his family relocated to Durham where Harris had been offered a sales job on WDNC. A week later, he was hosting a sports talk show. Eventually, he served as color commentator to then-Duke sportcaster, Add Penfield, broadcasting Duke football and basketball games. When Penfield experienced health problems, Harris filled in. Penfield retired in the spring of 1976, opening the door for Harris to become the \\"Voice of the Blue Devils\\" beginning with the 1976 football season. Nationally, Harris is best known for his play-by-play of Christian Laettner's buzzer beater in Duke's victory over the University of Kentucky in the 1992 East Regional of the NCAA Basketball Tournament. ESPN considers the 1992 East Regional Final in Philadelphia the \\"greatest college basketball game ever\\" played. Harris' description of \\"The Shot\\" from the radio broadcast is most often featured with the archival video footage, replacing that of the original television commentators: In December, 2010, Harris published his autobiography,\\"How Sweet It Is!: From the Cotton Mill to the Crows' Nest\\", recounting his storied career as the \\"Voice of the Blue Devils\\". He has been courtside to witness all five of Duke's National Championship wins. Included with the book is an 80-minute CD that features some of Harris‚Äô interviews, including Muhammad Ali and Red Skelton, along with famous radio calls like ‚ÄúThe Shot.‚Äù . The book, which Harris spent five years writing, was scheduled for a March 2010 release, but delayed until December. \\"It was all set to be released, but then Duke won another national championship.\\" Harris said, \\"So I had to add another chapter for obvious reasons.\\" Harris is active in book signings, often for the benefit of charities. He participated in a \\"red carpet book signing event\\" for Pantry, Inc. as part of their \\"Battle for Bean Street\\" competition, with the prize being a $20,000 corporate donation to the Duke Cancer Institute. Recently, Harris partnered with Kangeroo Express to host \\"Salute Our Troops\\", a fundraiser that raised $2.5 million in support of military service men and women. Reflecting on the retirement of a fellow broadcaster, Harris had this to say: \\"As long as my health is good and as long as my passion is still there for the games, the broadcasts and the kids, and as long as I'm still doing the job that Duke needs and wants me to do, I really don't want to retire anytime soon because I have fun doing it\\". Says, Harris, \\"I don't want to rust away. I want to wear out.‚Äù On Oct. 15, 2011 Harris celebrated his 400th consecutive Duke Football radio broadcast. ‚ÄúIt just means that the good Lord has given me good health for 36 plus years and enabled me to be there,‚Äù says Harris. ‚ÄúIt was not something that I had as a goal. I‚Äôm so happy that I‚Äôve got a job like mine and I get to do something that I love.‚Äù During his football career, Harris has worked with nine coaches, has called plays for All-Americas and future NFL players. After 456 games, Harris maintains there is still an element of excitement to this work. ‚ÄúA Saturday afternoon in Wallace Wade Stadium in late October is just as exciting to me as a Wednesday night in February in Cameron Indoor Stadium,‚Äù says Harris. On Feb. 9, 2012, Harris' call of a game between the University of North Carolina Tarheels and the Duke Blue Devils was said to rival his call of Laettner's \\"shot\\": Harris called his 1,200th Duke Men's Basketball game on February 16, 2012, an exciting game with the team overcoming a twenty-point deficit to defeat Harris' alma mater, North Carolina State, 78-73. Harris has advised young broadcasters: \\"Don‚Äôt try to be the next somebody. Be the best ‚Äúyour name‚Äù that you can be. Listen to all these other broadcasters, listen to the veterans to see how they do things, what they say, how they describe things...I think sometimes the younger people get a little bit antsy. They wanna have it happen now, and it‚Äôs not going to. You‚Äôve got to pay your dues.\\" Lewis Bowling, author and teacher at N.C. Central University and Duke University, declares that Harris is \\"a favorite among fans, and Duke athletes through the years have looked to this affable man as a father figure and friend. With Bob Harris' voice in Duke fans' ears, many of us can say to him, \\"How sweet it is!\\".

Novoye Pokoleniye has attributed the popularity of Hizb-ut-Tahrir to the social and economic conditions of the populace.

The Kazakh government denied the allegation, but said the defendants had at one point lived in the Shymkent Oblast, which they reached by illegally crossing the border. On 5 February 2005 police in Kentai, Kazakhstan found Hizb-ut-Tahrir books and leaflets in the attic of a resident's home. The books were written in Uzbek, Russian, and Kazakh. Police charged the resident with distributing extremist literature and encouraging religious strife. According to Marat Yermukanov of Eurasia Daily Monitor, \\"reports say\\" the resident \\"bought these publications at the market... to distribute the teachings of Hizb-ut-Tahrir\\" in Kentai.

Three days later, on 8 February, Almaty police shut down an HuT printing facility, taking 12,400 leaflets and 53 booklets from an apartment building. Hibratulla Doskaliyev, head of the South Kazakhstan Region interior department, criticized the government's handling of Hizb ut-Tahrir's growing popularity in August 2006.

In December 2005 the KNB extradited Rustam Chagilov, a suspected terrorist, to Russia. KNB officials detained an ethnic Uzbek and alleged member of HuT in Taraz, South Kazakhstan in April 2006. The KNB accused him of organizing an HuT cell Qoqon, Uzbekistan and extradited him to Uzbekistan. Kenzhenbulat Beknazarov, spokesman for the KNB announced on 22 December 2006 in Astana that an HuT cell-network active in multiple towns had been shut down. Beknazarov said, \\"Computers, more than 25,000 pamphlets, some 70 copies of religious extremist books and advanced printing equipment were confiscated during our searches.\\" Routes used to smuggle in extremist literature and foreign funding were also shut down.Hizb ut-Tahrir network dismantled in Kazakhstan Interfax-Religion Jamaat of Central Asian Mujahedins In 2004 National Security Committee (KNB) officials claimed they had shut down the Jamaat of Central Asian Mujahedins. However, in 2006, they again claimed to have foiled a terrorist plot orchestrated by JCAM members.Terror network claims unsettle Kazakh activists ISN Security Watch =2004= Vladimir Bozhko, first deputy chairman of Kazakhstan's National Security Committee (KNB), announced in a press conference on 11 November 2004 that the KNB had dismantled the Jamaat of Central Asian Mujahedins, arresting nine citizens of Kazakhstan and four of Uzbekistan. Police confiscated weapons, forged documents, a videotape of a speech given by Osama Bin Laden, and what Radio Free Europe called \\"extremist propaganda.\\" Four women, trained as suicide bombers, were detained. The government discovered that JCAM recruited 50 citizens of Uzbekistan and 20 of Kazakhstan since mid-2002. JCAM is, like the IMU, affiliated with Al Qaeda. Zhakshybek Biimurzaev, headed JCAM's operations in Kazakhstan while Ahmad Bekmirzaev, headed operations in Uzbekistan. Both served in the IMU. Biimurzaev has been arrested by Uzbek police and the National Security Service of Kyrgyzstan. Uzbek police killed Bekmirzaev in a shoot-out near Tashkent on 30 March. Biimurzaev is reported as having said, \\"This year there were three terror attacks in Tashkent in July. I organized them on the instruction of my amir Usman. Three Kazakh citizens took part in them. I was opposed to this, but the amir ordered it.\\" Usman later ordered Biimurzaev to assassinate what Radio Free Europe referred to as a \\"high-ranking Uzbek official.\\" Uzbek officials said Avaz Shoyusupov, a Kazakh citizen, is one of the suicide bombers who died in the 30 July attacks. Bekmirzaev's wife, Makhira Ibragimova, and Isa Eruov, Kazakh citizens, killed themselves in suicide bombing attacks in Uzbekistan in spring 2004. Police caught Aidos Usmonov, an Uzbek citizen and an aide of Biimurzaev, in Pavlodar, Kazakhstan. Usmonov had recently returned from Russia, where he allegedly recruited for JCAM. The Kazakh government extradited Uzbek terrorist suspects arrested in Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan. Deutsche Welle and the Uzbek government reported that 15 suspects charged in relation to the Tashkent bombings were trained in terrorist camps in South Waziristan, Pakistan and in \\"private apartments\\" in Shymkent, and other cities, in Kazakhstan. Deputy Chairman Bozhko disagreed, saying \\"there were no camps and bases for training terrorists on the territory of our country.\\" =2006= President Nazarbayev on 18 April 2006 said the KNB needed to do more to protect the nation's security. Sergei Minenkov, National Security Committee member in charge of counter-terrorism, announced the day after that a KNB-Interior Ministry operation had prevented a major terrorist attack with assistance from the security services of an unnamed foreign nation and again shut down JCAM, calling it a \\"criminal gang set up for terrorist activities.\\" Some interpreted Minenkov's statements as a response to Nazarbayev's criticism. Minenkov said the plot involved bombing the offices of security officials, government buildings, and public safety facilities. The ten suspects, who allegedly acted on instructions from a foreign nation, were charged with 'instigating religious strife' and illegal possession of firearms. When the operation took place, JCAM members were, according to ISN Security Watch, \\"monitoring Kyrgyz political activities.\\" 10 JCAM members in Almaty were arrested and police confiscated weapons and extremist books and tapes. The suspects were recruiting Kazakh citizens and establishing terror bases when they were arrested. Minenkov said, \\"Foreign ideologists of terrorism recommended attacking public places and strategically important infrastructure facilities\\" in letters found by police. Seized documents included instructions on explosive construction and maps of targets. Serikbai Alibayev of For a Just Kazakhstan opposition coalition said, \\"The National Security Committee's accusation against the opposition‚Äîthat it could have joined the terrorist group‚Äîis nothing less than blame based on nothing. According to our laws and the constitution, law-enforcement agencies immediately should open a case against the National Security Committee and start an investigation. They should be brought to court for saying that‚Äîthey are violating our constitution.\\" Zauresh Battalova, also of For a Just Kazakhstan, said, \\"The National Security Committee is a tool in the hands of the authorities. Today, the National Security Committee is following the authorities' order to discredit those who really care about people in order to stop them.

The drill is the first time China and Kazakhstan have held anti-terrorism maneuvers. The Collective Security Treaty Organization held exercises in the Caspian sea simultaneously. The simulation lasted for three days and involved Kazakh forces from border patrol, the Interior Ministry, and the Emergency Situations Ministry, and Chinese law enforcement forces and security services. 700 police officials used armed helicopters and anti-riot vehicles to force the 'enemy' into a narrow valley along the border of Kazakhstan and Xinjiang, China after rescuing 'hostages'.

Criticism Nezavisimaya Gazeta interviewed Vyacheslav Kasymov, director of the executive committee of the Regional Anti- terrorist Center of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and published the interview on 7 February. In the interview Kasymov accused the Kazakh government of giving refuge to terrorist organizations, specifically Saudi Binladin Group, which operated in Astana. In November 2004 the Supreme Court ruled against the company's claim to 7 square kilometres of land in Astana. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry issued a statement two days later, on 9 February, calling Kasymov's statements \\"absolutely incompatible with the status of a head of the structure of a large international organization and casts a shadow of doubt on the reputation and position of the SCO in the contemporary world.\\" The statement said the Kazakh government has signed 12 UN anti-terrorist conventions. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry has since characterized Kasymov's comments as \\"inappropriate\\" and \\"totally deprived of the spirit of the basic documents of [the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]\\" because \\"There weren't and there are not any terrorists' bases or camps on the soil of Kazakhstan.\\"The Ministry of foreign affairs of Kazakhstan considers the statements of the director of the Antiterroristic structure to the Shanghai Organization of Cooperation as \\"inappropriate\\" Permanent Mission of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the United Nations The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and Human Rights Watch have criticized the Nazarbayev administration's policy of transferring terrorist suspects to neighboring countries, specifically Uzbekistan, where HRW says suspects face torture.Kazakhstan: Do Not Deport Uzbek Human Rights Advocate Human Rights WatchUN concerned at disappearance in Kazakhstan Scoop Independent News The strongest criticism of the Nazarbayev administration's counter-terrorism operations comes from Harout Semerdjian of the University of California, Los Angeles.

It was released for the Neo Geo arcade system in July 1991 and later on Neo Geo console in October of the same year. Its gameplay was similar to SNK's earlier 1990 first-person shooter and beat 'em up game, The Super Spy, but with role-playing game elements and hack & slash combat instead of shooting and fist-fighting. The game allowed cooperative gameplay with up to two players on the same screen. As only the player characters' silhouettes are visible on screen as wire-frame models, much like Punch-Out!!, the game's perspective may be considered either first-person or third-person. The game was later cited as an inspiration for the 2010 first-person fighting game Rage of the Gladiator. A sequel of the game entitled Crossed Swords II was released in Japan on May 2, 1995 for the Neo-Geo CD, and was one of the few games designed specifically for the Neo-Geo CD, rather than being an arcade port. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot. Crossed Swords requires correct timing and movement to progress. The basic rule for the game is to defend first before striking. The player wields both a weapon and shield and can strafe, as well as guard the upper or middle part of the body. Two different weapon strikes are available, a regular attack and a thrusting attack. Weapon-based magic can also be used. Multiple paths through the game are available and the player has an option to skip the first and second chapters freely.Crossed Swords user's manual (Neo Geo AES, US) Plot In the enchanted land of Belkana all was well until plagues of creatures started rampaging through. But it didn't stop there, from deep within the mountains of Graisia, the Demon Warlord Nausizz arose and led the attacks wiping out settlement after settlement. However a brave warrior called \\"The Knight of the Journey\\" came a long way on a quest to stop these monstrosities. After aiding the Poor Village of Dio from the Caterdragon, the knight heads to the Castle Pulista, but as he is briefed by the king of the problems they face, an elite dark knight appears and kidnaps the princess. The knight fights his way through the enemy lands in the Matius Tower, the Gauda Fortress, the Land Battleship and finally passes the Entrance to the Devil World. Along his way, he is helped by loyalties of the kingdom. The knight battles through the Castle Graisia and comes face to face with Nausizz. As a demon with honour, Nausizz is so impressed with the knight's progress, that he has sent the princess back to Pulista. As the knight defeats Nausizz, he transforms into a fiendish demon dragon. The knight slays him and escapes the collapsing castle. Back in Castle Pulista the knight is offered to come and live with the king. Peace can proceed once more in Belkana.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Crossed Swords on their September 1, 1991 issue as being the tenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Wonder Three. On release, Famicom Ts≈´shin scored the Neo Geo version of the game a 24 out of 40.

History Caffrey was born in the shipbuilding town of Wallsend, Northumberland. His father had worked at Swan Hunter's Shipyards and both of his grandfathers were miners. Joe's grandfather, Ned Murray, was an active Trade Unionist and Labour politician as well as a District Councilor. His mother, Lynne, is a Councillor in Gateshead. Caffrey chose to become an actor and was trained for three years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. In 1984-85 he was also a member of the a cappella band, The Workey Tickets, who did several fund raising gigs, including a gig at the Albert Hall in London, for the striking miners and their families. Caffrey first began performing theatre in London. He achieved West End stardom in Lee Hall's farce Cooking with Elvis. He had also several TV appearances in ITV and BBC productions and appeared in the Bridget Jones film, The Edge of Reason (2004). He played Billy's older brother Tony in the original London cast of Billy Elliot the Musical and then returned to the show in December 2008, this time in the role of Jackie Elliot, Billy's father. According to his own words, Caffrey is a huge fan of playwright Alan Plater. He says: \\"When you get a writer of Alan's calibre saying 'I'm going to write you a part in this' you think 'Christ almighty, most actors would bite your hand off for that kind of chance.'\\" Caffrey is associated with Live Theatre which is a small theatre on Newcastle's Quayside, which has nurtured actors that now perform in The Pitmen Painters who have progressed to London's West End and Broadway.

The black-throated bushtit (Aegithalos concinnus), also known as the black-throated tit, is a very small passerine bird in the family Aegithalidae. Taxonomy The species has six currently recognised subspecies, and several others have been suggested. Genetic studies have suggested that these subspecies may represent separate species, but further research is needed. Description The black-throated bushtit is a small passerine, around 10.5 cm long and weighing 4-9 g. There is considerable racial variation in the plumage, but all subspecies have a medium length tail (as opposed to the long tail of the related long-tailed tit), a black throat and a black 'bandit mask' around the eye. The nominate race has a chestnut cap, breast band and flanks and dark grey back, wings and tail, and a white belly. The other subspecies have generally the same pattern (minus the chest band) but with grey caps or all grey bellies and flanks. Both sexes are alike. Distribution and habitat It ranges from the foothills of the Himalayas, stretching across northern India through north-eastern Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, northern Myanmar, Vietnam, and Taiwan. Disjunct populations also occur in southern Vietnam, the island of Hainan and further north in China up to the Yellow River.MacKinnon, John; Phillipps, Karen; He, Fen-qi (2000). A Field Guide to the Birds of China. Oxford University Press. . It lives in open broadleaf forest as well as pine forest, generally occurring in middle altitudes. Behaviour The black-throated bushtit is highly social and will travel in large flocks of up to 40 birds. Breeding The nest is constructed out of moss and lichen and hangs from the branches of trees. Feeding The species feeds on small insects and spiders, as well as small seeds, fruits and berries (particularly raspberries). Group numbers swell during the non-breeding season, but smaller groups exist year round. These groups will often join mixed-species feeding flocks.

It is known Miyamoto Musashi helped in building the castle as he was invited by Ogasawara Tadanao to be a \\"Construction Supervisor\\". The castle only took one year to complete, which was relatively fast for the time period. This was done so quickly as a result of a 1615 law mandating one castle per clan, so many castles were dismantled and parts of some were used to construct Akashi Castle. The castle was built in Akashi, which was an important strategic point between Osaka and western Japan, where many major tozama daimy≈ç had their feudal estates.

A household name in the 1920s and 1930s, Cook was one of America's most popular entertainers, and he headlined at New York's famed Palace Theatre. After appearing on Broadway he broke into radio. Early life Born Joseph Lopez in Evansville, Indiana, in 1890, he and his elder brother Leo were orphaned and adopted by a distant relative, Mrs. Anna Cook, at the age of three and six, respectively. He lived in the back of the grocery store of his adoptive parents at the corner of Fourth and Oak in Evansville.\\"Neighbor Joe Cook One of Merriest of Comedians,\\" Poughkeepsie Journal, p. 10, Sunday, February 5, 1950 Career Cook joined a circus in 1906, which propelled him to vaudeville, Broadway, and Hollywood. His brother Leo and he were billed as \\"Joe Cook and Brother\\" were they were in vaudeville together, from about 1909 to 1916. Joe Cook's physical talents were remarkable. He was an incredible juggler, could walk a tightrope, ride a unicycle, mime, and perform many other circus skills with ease. With this he combined an uncanny ability to tell nonsensical stories that made audiences roar with laughter. Added to this was his penchant for creating ridiculously complex inventions to perform absurdly simple or totally useless tasks. Mix in a little piano, violin, and ukulele playing and you had quite a show. The broad variety of Cook's act led to his nickname ‚Äì \\"One Man Vaudeville\\". New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson once wrote, \\"Next to Leonardo da Vinci, Joe Cook is the most versatile man known to recorded times.\\" In 1930, noted columnist Walter Winchell wrote that \\"Joe Cook is certainly one of the musical theatre's three geniuses. I can't at the moment think of the other two.\\" Following a very successful fifteen years in vaudeville - three of them in blackface, Cook - most often teamed with stooge/future restaurateur Dave Chasen - became a late 1920s/early 1930s Broadway musical comedy star. He appeared, most memorably, in such shows as Rain or Shine, Fine and Dandy - the first hit completely scored by a woman (Kay Swift),Ohl, p. 82. and Hold Your Horses. Corey Ford, the co-author of the last-named musical, wrote of Cook's Broadway debut: \\"When I first saw Joe Cook in 1923, he was co-starring in Earl Carroll's Vanities with Peggy Hopkins Joyce, whom he used to refer to as 'that somewhat different virgin'. I sat in the balcony and marveled at the bland deadpan expression, the slightly curled mouth, the easy flow of nonsense patter as he walked a tightrope or juggled Indian clubs while explaining to the audience why he would not imitate four Hawaiians.\\"Ford, p. 134. Cook's \\"Four Hawaiians\\" routine was his most famous;Cook, pp. 1‚Äì64. Joe would explain that he was actually imitating only two Hawaiians. He \\"could imitate four Hawaiians but did not wish to do so because that would put all the performers who could only imitate two Hawaiians out of work\\". Cook would appear on stage with a ukulele in hand and begin: \\"I will give an imitation of four Hawaiians. This is one [whistles]; this is another [plays ukulele]; and this is the third [marks time with his foot]. I could imitate four Hawaiians just as easily, but I will tell you the reason why I don't do it. You see, I bought a horse for $50 and it turned out to be a running horse. I was offered $15,000 for him, and I took it. I built a house for the $15,000, and when it was finished, a neighbor offered me $100,000 for it. He said my house stood right where he wanted to dig a well. So I took the $100,000 to accommodate him. I invested the $100,000 on peanuts, and that year, there was a peanut famine, so I sold the peanuts for $350,000. Now why should a man with $350,000 bother to imitate four Hawaiians?\\" Never a fan of Hollywood, Cook made only two full-length movies, which is a major reason he is not widely remembered today. In 1930, he starred in the film version of Rain or Shine, which was directed by a young Frank Capra, and is still shown occasionally on television. It has recently been completely restored and will be permanently preserved by Sony Pictures, the successor of Columbia Pictures. Cook's only other feature movie, Arizona Mahoney, was filmed in 1936 and included a young Larry \\"Buster\\" Crabbe. The 1930s also saw Cook's successful transition into the new medium of radio, as the host of two variety series and a frequent guest on many others. Cook, from 1924-1941, made his residence at Lake Hopatcong, in Hopatcong, New Jersey, which was then a popular resort. His house was appropriately named \\"Sleepless Hollow\\" for the many parties he gave and celebrities he entertained.History , Borough of Hopatcong. Accessed February 1, 2011. \\"The center for much of this activity was Joe Cook's Sleepless Hollow in Hopatcong's Davis Cove. Cook was a popular Vaudevillian, comedian, and musical theater star who lived at the Lake from 1924 to 1941.\\" One visitor, his librettist Donald Ogden Stewart, later recalled that \\"Joe lived on a mad gag-infested estate in New Jersey which bewilderingly expressed his genius. On his three-hole golf course one drove off confidently into what looked like a fairway only to have one's ball rebound sharply over one's head from a huge rock which had been cunningly camouflaged. The last green was a golfer's paradise in that no matter where the ball landed it rolled obediently into the hole. Conditions inside the house were similarly deranged. The \\"butler\\" was one of the contortionists, acrobats, midgets or other show-business people whom Joe had picked up his years in Vaudeville. Poor Mrs. Cook lived bravely in this cuckooland and struggled apologetically to bring some degree of common sense into the madhouse.\\"Stewart, p. 183. The Cook house still survives at Lake Hopatcong but is not open to the public. Later life and death Cook was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1941. This forced his retirement from show business. He sold the lake house the same year and moved to a more modest residence in New York State, where he resided until his death in 1959. Had Cook stayed healthy until the advent of television, his playful and physical style of comedy might well have made him one of the new medium's biggest stars, as was the case with his contemporary, Milton Berle.

Hendrix, first published in 2004. Plot introduction The backdrop for this story is an informational arms races between a future United States of America and China. Both countries are attempting to build a quantum computer, which they believe will be the ultimate information weapon, creating and breaking encryption schemes. One of the American investigators, Dr. Jaron L. Kwok, is mysteriously killed while in Hong Kong, and his mathematical understudy Ben Cho is ordered to pick up Kwok's investigation in an attempt to find out why and how he died. Running parallel to this storyline are the lives of Don Markham (known as Don Strum in Cybernesia) and Lu Mei-lin (also known as Marilyn Lu). Don is a computer programmer whose work specializes in the virtual reality world Cybernesia. Lu is a forensic detective who works in Hong Kong. After Kwok's death she is the leading detective on the case, called to Sha Tin by the Guoanbo, China's version of the CIA and its leader in the race for the quantum computer. At the time of Kwok's death a holocaust is disseminated throughout the world, showing the circumstances of the virtual reality world that he had died in. However, his death prompts not only the US and China, but multiple other organizations (from terrorists to secret societies) to go to any lengths for the chance to get binotech, the newest technology that reduplicates itself and stores a huge amount of information in tiny quantities. Reception Regina Schroeder in his review for Booklist said that \\"Layers of secret ruling societies, interconnections between historical cryptography and the work of the tale‚Äôs own cutting-edge scientists (including everything from Matteo Ricci‚Äôs memory palaces to the Cabala), and an unexpected danger to reality combine with political scheming in this tight thriller with a clever historical basis.\\" Publishers Weekly in their review said \\"the book features abstruse speculation on memory and forgetting, on the making and breaking of secrets and the mind's ability to manipulate the quantum nature of reality. Unfortunately, the earnestness of conspiracy theory punctures the dizzying metaphysical bubbles Hendrix blows, leaving the story a bit flat. And in an infinitude of infinite universes, where everything occurs, tragedy loses its significance and sting.\\" Release details *2004, United States of America, Random House Inc. , Pub date March 2004, Paperback *2006, United States of America, Random House Inc. , Pub date January 2006, Paperback *2006, United States of America, Random House Inc. , Pub date January 2006, Electronic Notes Category:2004 novels Category:2004 science fiction novels ","title":"The Labyrinth Key"},{"id":"10117063","text":"Sedlec may refer to the following locations in the Czech Republic: * Sedlec (Plze≈à-North District), village in Plze≈à-North District * Sedlec (ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice District), village in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice District * Sedlec (Litomƒõ≈ôice District), village in Litomƒõ≈ôice District * Sedlec (B≈ôeclav District), village in B≈ôeclav District * Sedlec (Prague-East District), village in Prague-East District * Sedlec (T≈ôeb√≠ƒç District), village in T≈ôeb√≠ƒç District * Sedlec (Mlad√° Boleslav District), village in Mlad√° Boleslav District * Sedlec (Prague), district of the capital city of Prague * Sedlec (Kutn√° Hora), district of the town of Kutn√° Hora ** Sedlec Ossuary * Sedlec- Prƒçice, town in P≈ô√≠bram District ","title":"Sedlec"},{"id":"10117075","text":"Studio Alex was a Japanese video game development firm.

Acid-base extraction is routinely performed during the work-up after chemical syntheses and for the isolation of compounds and natural products like alkaloids from crude extracts. The product is largely free of neutral and acidic or basic impurities. It is not possible to separate chemically similar acids or bases using this simple method.  Theory  Overview of an acid-base extraction The fundamental theory behind this technique is that salts, which are ionic, tend to be water-soluble while neutral molecules tend not to be. The addition of an acid to a mixture of an organic base and acid will result in the acid remaining uncharged, while the base will be protonated to form a salt. If the organic acid, such as a carboxylic acid, is sufficiently weak, its self-ionization can be suppressed by the added acid. Conversely, the addition of a base to a mixture of an organic acid and base will result in the base remaining uncharged, while the acid is deprotonated to give the corresponding salt. Once again, the self-ionization of a strong base is suppressed by the added base. The acid-base extraction procedure can also be used to separate very weak acids from stronger acids and very weak bases from stronger bases, as long as the difference of their pKa (or pKb) constants is large enough. For example: * Very weak acids with phenolic OH groups like phenol, 2-naphthol, or 4-hydroxyindole (pKa around 10) from stronger acids like benzoic acid or sorbic acid (pKa around 4‚Äì5) * Very weak bases like caffeine or 4-nitroaniline (pKb around 13‚Äì14) from stronger bases like mescaline or dimethyltryptamine (pKb around 3‚Äì4) Usually the pH is adjusted to a value roughly between the pKa (or pKb) constants of the compounds to be separated. Weak acids like citric acid, phosphoric acid, or diluted sulfuric acid are used for moderately acidic pH values, and hydrochloric acid or more concentrated sulfuric acid is used for strongly acidic pH values. Similarly, weak bases like ammonia or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) are used for moderately basic pH values while stronger bases like potassium carbonate (K2CO3) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) are used for strongly alkaline conditions.  Technique  Usually, the mixture is dissolved in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or diethyl ether (ether), and poured into a separating funnel. An aqueous solution of the acid or base is added, and the pH of the aqueous phase is adjusted to bring the compound of interest into its required form. After shaking and allowing for phase separation, the phase containing the compound of interest is collected. The procedure is then repeated with this phase at the opposite pH range. The order of the step is not important and the process can be repeated to increase the separation. However, it is often convenient to have the compound dissolved in the organic phase after the last step, so that the evaporation of the solvent yields the product.  Limitations  The procedure works only for acids and bases with a large difference in solubility between their charged and their uncharged form. The procedure does not work for: * Zwitterions with acidic and basic functional groups in the same molecule, e.g. glycine which tend to be water-soluble at most pH. * Very lipophilic amines that do not easily dissolve in the aqueous phase in their charged form, e.g. triphenylamine and trihexylamine. * Very lipophilic acids that do not easily dissolve in the aqueous phase in their charged form, e.g. fatty acids. * Lower amines like ammonia, methylamine, or triethanolamine which are miscible or significantly soluble in water at most pH. * Hydrophilic acids like acetic acid, citric acid, and most inorganic acids like sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid.  Alternatives  Alternatives to acid-base extraction including: * filtering the mixture through a plug of silica gel or alumina ‚Äî charged salts tend to remain strongly adsorbed to the silica gel or alumina * ion exchange chromatography can separate acids, bases, or mixtures of strong and weak acids and bases by their varying affinities to the column medium at different pH.

The game was described by the development team as a . The story follows the protagonist Ikumi Amasawa, a teenage girl who joins a mysterious organization called Fargo in the hopes of discovering why and how her mother died, who was a member of the same group. The gameplay in Moon follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the three female main characters. The game ranked twice in the national top 50 for best-selling PC games sold in Japan. Much of the staff that created the game later became the founding members of the visual novel brand Key. Moon was the starting point for Key's origins, and was the first time the principal Key team was formed. A novel based on the game written by Midori Tateyama was released in July 1998 by Movic. The game's original soundtrack was released bundled with D≈çsei's soundtrack in August 2000 at Comiket 58; D≈çsei was Tactics' first game. Moon has been referenced in other media not directly related to the game, such as in Tactics' third game One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e, and in the second anime adaptation of Key's first game Kanon. Gameplay Average dialogue and narrative in Moon depicting the main character Ikumi talking to Haruka. Moon is a drama and horror visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Ikumi Amasawa. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Moon follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are three main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. The player has to manually navigate through the corridors of Fargo to explore the surroundings. The game is split into 20 sub-parts each given a title in English written mostly in white where a portion of the title is displayed in red, and each covers a single day. There are seven endings to the game: a single true end, two normal ends, and four bad ends. In the original game, a bonus role-playing game became available on the title screen after the game was completed at least once. This was later removed from the full-voice DVD edition of the game. There are scenes in Moon with sexual CGs depicting a given heroine having sex. Plot and characters Moon story revolves around a mysterious organization known as Fargo. The protagonist of the story is a young high school girl named who discovers that Fargo was involved with the death of her mother six years before the story begins. Miyoko, who would often make special cream stew for her daughter, was a member of Fargo. Following this revelation, Ikumi joins Fargo to discover how and why her mother died while also slowly uncovering the group's disturbing nature of harnessing psychic abilities through torture. Ikumi ultimately wants to take out her revenge against Fargo for killing her mother. Ikumi had been one of a large group of young girls her age that gathered at a seminar for people of all ages, both male and female, who wanted to join Fargo for different reasons. Ikumi had been ordered to get on a truck which would take the group to Fargo, and on the ride, Ikumi meets two other girls with similar goals in mind as her. One of the girls is named who joined Fargo in order to save her older brother. She starts to work with Ikumi for the sake of their mutual goals. The second girl is named who is searching for her older sister who joined Fargo in order to obtain the 'invisible power', a kind of extrasensory perception. Yui has an optimistic personality that hides a gloomy past of which she has no memory. Each of the girls have a strong will to complete their respective purposes, and they help each other along the way. At Fargo, Ikumi meets others who are affiliated with the group. One such person is , a modest believer in Fargo's cause; something happened in her past related to her mother. At Fargo, Ikumi begins living with a teenage boy known as . He helps Ikumi in her search for the answers regarding her mother; it is never revealed what his true name is. Others include , a young man in Fargo with an arrogant attitude, and , the symbol of Fargo and the mastermind behind the entire operation; he is the main antagonist. Development and release Moon production was headed by YET11, the pseudonym of Tsutomu Yoshizawa. Planning for Moon was headed by Jun Maeda, who also worked on the game's scenario with fellow writer Naoki Hisaya. Art direction and character design was provided by Itaru Hinoue, while the computer graphics in the game was supplemented by Miracle Mikipon and Shinory. The game's soundtrack was primarily composed by Shinji Orito, with two tracks composed by YET11, and one track each composed by Maeda and Ishisan. Excluding YET11 and Ishisan, the staff that created the game later became the founding members of the visual novel brand Key. Moon was first released on November 21, 1997 playable on a Windows PC as a CD-ROM. Nexton released Moon Renewal on August 21, 1998 with an improved game engine. AI System published the game under the title Moon Memorial Selection on September 14, 2000 for a cheaper price. Nexton released Moon DVD LimitedEdition on July 12, 2002 with added support for Windows 98/Me/2000/XP as a DVD-ROM; this release was also called Moon DVD Final Version by Nexton. The DVD edition, and subsequent releases, also included full voice acting, two animated sequences at the beginning of the game, and improved graphics. A CD-ROM version of the DVD edition titled Moon CD LimitedEdition was released on three CDs on September 20, 2002. Nexton released Moon DVDPG Edition was released in Japan on January 30, 2003 playable as a DVD game. Nexton later re-released the DVD edition with updated support for Windows XP/Vista/7 on April 2, 2010.

Biography A singer, songwriter and guitarist from the age of 13, Mike Hurst was encouraged by rock singer Eddie Cochran after auditioning for Jack Good's television show Oh Boy! but in 1960, after failing to secure a recording contract, Hurst moved away from music and began to work in insurance. Later, though, after his mother answered an advertisement in The Stage, on his behalf, for a singer for a pop/folk group, Hurst won an audition. He joined Dusty and Tom Springfield in The Springfields in February 1962. After entering the UK Singles Chart with \\"Breakaway\\", they scored a hit single in the US with \\"Silver Threads and Golden Needles\\", becoming the first UK vocal group to make the US Top 20. UK chart success continued in 1963 with \\"Island of Dreams\\" and \\"Say I Won't Be There\\". They were voted the top British group by readers of the NME in 1962. The Springfields' final performance was in Sunday Night at the London Palladium, the biggest television programme of the day, where they were presented with a trophy by compere Bruce Forsyth. The group disbanded in October 1963. In 1964, Hurst formed a band called the Methods, featuring Jimmy Page and then Albert Lee on guitar as well as Tony Ashton on keyboards. After leaving the band Hurst began producing for Andrew Oldham (Tony Rivers and the Castaways) and Mickie Most. In September 1965, he oversaw Marc Bolan's first recording session, at Decca when he recorded \\"The Wizard\\". In 1965, after a brief collaboration with Bolan, he discovered singer-songwriter Cat Stevens, and signed him to the new Deram record label (an imprint of Decca) and produced his first five hit singles including \\"Matthew and Son\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Get Me a Gun\\". During this time he also produced recordings and hits for P. P. Arnold (\\"The First Cut Is the Deepest\\"), The Move (\\"Curly\\"), Manfred Mann (\\"Mighty Quinn\\"), Spencer Davis Group (\\"Time Seller\\"), Neil MacArthur (a pseudonym for Colin Blunstone), Warm Sounds, Ayshea and Alan Bown. In 1969 Hurst formed an orchestra and recorded covers of popular songs and themes of the day. In 1970 and 1971, he produced for Australian band New World, and recorded two albums for Capitol Records, using sidesmen such as Tony Ashton, B. J. Cole, Clem Cattini, Ian Paice, Jon Lord, Rod Argent and Nicky Hopkins. In 1973, he formed his own production company, Solid Gold, and wrote and produced for the band Fancy, achieving US chart success with the singles \\"Touch Me\\" and a cover of The Troggs \\"Wild Thing\\". The same year he signed Showaddywaddy to Bell Records and produced a string of UK hit singles for them. These included \\"Under the Moon of Love\\", \\"Three Steps to Heaven\\" and \\"When\\". Following his success with Showaddywaddy, he produced Modern Priscilla, a 1978 disco album for Cilla Black, and early recordings by Bruce Woolley and the Camera Club. In 1978, he started managing Shakin' Stevens, and produced his first hit \\"Hot Dog\\" the same year. In 1981, he formed a vocal group with Mary Hopkin and Mike de Albuquerque called Sundance and toured with Dr Hook appearing on the Parkinson and Russell Harty TV shows. In 1984, he became head of Lamborghini Records, famous for discovering Samantha Fox. 21st century work includes production for Belle & Sebastian (2002), and his son's band, Jonas and Plunkett (2007). He also runs rock schools for youngsters through his Rockmaster company, and is a foremost lecturer on the history of English speaking popular music from the Middle Ages to the present day, appearing at schools, U3A groups etc. throughout the country. Hurst also appears with his new Springfields, including Andy Marlow and Alice Pitt-Carter. Hurst and wife Marjorie have seven children between them - Tim, Alexis, Caroline, Muffin, Bryony, Jonas and Adam - and 17 grandchildren.

Early life His father was Harvey Sullivan, a U.S. District Marshal who had followed the Chilkoot Trail in 1898 to join the Klondike Gold Rush. Sullivan was born in Portland, Oregon, as it was a common practice in the settler communities of Alaska in the first half of the 20th century for expectant mothers to leave Alaska to have their babies in not such a primitive environment. Sullivan grew up in Valdez, then the location of the federal court for the Third Judicial District of the Territory of Alaska. His mother was elected mayor in 1934. During the summer of 1937, he lied about his age in order to obtain a job at the Kennecott Mines; he was only 15, and the minimum age was 16. After graduating from Valdez High School, Sullivan went on to join the Army during World War II and served in the Aleutian Islands. After the war, he lived in Nenana and worked as a Deputy Marshall. He married Margaret Eagan Sullivan (died 2007), the youngest daughter of Daniel and Isabelle Eagan of Fairbanks. Together, they had nine children, including Anchorage Mayor Dan Sullivan. Political career In 1952, the family moved to Fairbanks, where Sullivan was employed as the manager of a freight company. He was elected to the city council and became active in the Republican Party. In 1959, the family moved to Anchorage, having been transferred there by the freight company. Sullivan would continue to play a role in the Fairbanks community for years to come. He is listed as one of the original incorporators of Mt. McKinley Bank, founded in 1965. In 1964, Sullivan was appointed to the Alaska House of Representatives to fill a vacancy created by the appointment of Representative William H. Sanders to the Superior Court. In 1965 he was elected to the Anchorage City Council, and in 1967, he was elected Mayor of Anchorage. In 1975, the Greater Anchorage Area Borough unified with the City of Anchorage and several smaller cities to become the Municipality of Anchorage. Sullivan, the city mayor, defeated Jack Roderick, the borough mayor to become mayor of the new city government. Sullivan fulfilled the maximum two terms mandated by the municipal charter, handing over the reins to Tony Knowles on January 1, 1982. In 1976, he vetoed an anti-discrimination bill extending protection to sexual orientation. This became a campaign issue in the 1978 mayoral race, where he successfully defended his seat against challenger Dave Rose. In 1979, he invited Pope John Paul II to visit Anchorage. On February 26, 1981, the pope visited the city. Toward the end of the 1970s, he proposed what he called \\"Project 80s\\", a campaign of beautification and preservation of historic sites. After his lengthy tenure as mayor, Sullivan served as the senior vice president of Western Airlines. Legacy The Sullivan Arena in Anchorage, constructed in 1983 as a part of Project 80s, was named in his honor. Margaret Eagan Sullivan Park, located at the northern end of Spenard Road where it crosses Chester Creek, was named for Sullivan's wife. Marc Marlow, an Anchorage electrical contractor turned real estate developer, began an ambitious urban renewal project in the northeastern corner of downtown Anchorage. The centerpiece of the project was the rebuilding of the McKinley Tower, constructed in the early 1950s and abandoned in 1984. Adjacent to that building, Marlow constructed an assisted living facility and named it the George M. Sullivan House. Death George M. Sullivan died from complications from lung cancer on September 23, 2009. He was preceded in death by his wife, Margaret, and their son, Harvey.

Samuel Lucas, a Wesleyan minister, and his wife Elizabeth, n√©e Broadhead. His father had a passion for geology and botany, and Arthur developed an interest in natural science. Lucas' early childhood was spent in Cornwall, and when he was around nine years of age a move was made to Stow on the Wold in Gloucestershire. Here Lucas went to his first private school, but soon afterwards was sent to Kingswood School in Bath, where he was given a solid education in Classics, Modern Languages, and Mathematics. Lucas went to Balliol College, Oxford in 1870, with an exhibition, and associated with many people became the most distinguished of their time. He graduated with a fourth class honours degree in 1874, following pneumonia before his final examination, but he later won the Burdett-Coutts geological scholarship in 1876. Lucas then went to London to commence a medical course, and won the entrance science scholarship to the London Hospital in Whitechapel. When Lucas was halfway through his course his widower elder brother, Thomas Pennington Lucas, was ordered to leave England due to contracting tuberculosis and went to Australia. School Master Arthur Lucas abandoned his course, although was nevertheless awarded B. Sc. by University of London in 1879. He became a master at The Leys School, Cambridge in order to provide for his brother's three young children who remained in the UK. Lucas had previously won the gold medal at an examination for botany held by the Apothecaries Society, open to all medical students of the London schools. Lucas enjoyed his five years at The Leys school. He found the boys frank and high-spirited, fond of games and yet able to do good work in the class-rooms. Lucas played in the football team, until he broke his collar-bone, and founded a natural history society of which the whole school became members. A museum was established to which Lucas gave his father's fine collection of fossils, and also the family collection of plants, which contained 1200 out of the 1400 described species of British flowering plants and ferns. The museum grew in after years, and gained a reputation at Cambridge when one of the boys made interesting finds in the pleistocene beds of the Cam valley. The results of work done by Lucas on the Isle of Wight were published in the Geological Magazine, leading to Lucas being elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of London. Wesley College Lucas applied in 1882 for the headmastership of Wesley College, Melbourne, but the appointment was given to Arthur Way. Later on he was appointed mathematical and science master at the same school, arrived in Melbourne at the end of January 1883, and immediately began his work. Newington College At the end of 1892 Lucas was appointed headmaster of Newington College, Sydney. During his six years at Newington the number of pupils increased by 50 per cent and the school had much academic success. Lucas was the president of the Old Newingtonians' Union in 1897. Sydney Grammar School In 1899 Lucas became senior mathematical and science master at the Sydney Grammar school, was acting headmaster for part of the war years, and finally headmaster from 1920 to 1923. He was an admirable teacher, beloved by many generations of schoolboys, and exercising a great moral influence on them. University and science career Lucas did not confine his life to school work, and while at Wesley College also lectured on natural science to the colleges at the University of Melbourne, and in later years lectured on physiography at the University of Sydney. He also took much interest in the various learned societies, and during his early days at Melbourne was president of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria (which was founded by his brother) and edited the Victorian Naturalist for some years. Lucas was a member of the council of the Royal Society of Victoria, and subsequently of the Linnean Society of New South Wales, of which he also became president (1907‚Äì1909). Lucas contributed many papers to their proceedings; a list of more than 60 will be found in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales, vol. LXII, pp. 250‚Äì2. He described several new species of Australian reptiles (1894‚Äì1903) with Charles Frost.The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.com. He wrote with Arthur Dendy An Introduction to the Study of Botany which was published in 1892 (3rd ed. 1915), with W. H. D. Le Souef, The Animals of Australia (1909), and The Birds of Australia (1911). After retiring from school teaching at 70 years of age, Lucas became acting-professor of mathematics at the university of Tasmania for over two years. He afterwards continued his scientific studies, giving particular attention to the algae on which he was the Australian authority. His handbook, Part 1 of The Seaweeds of South Australia was issued just after his death. His large collection of algal specimens was bequeathed to the Commonwealth of Australia. It was initially stored at the CSIRO offices in Canberra and then moved for easier access by researchers to the National Herbarium of New South Wales. This move, and curation of the collection, was overseen by Valerie May. Family life He married Charlotte Christmas on 29 July 1882 in St Cuthbert, Bedfordshire. She died in 1919. They had four daughters (one of whom died when young) Mesdames Ida Cortis-Jones and J. J. O'Keefe, Miss C. Lucas, and one son. He lived with his daughter Cortis- Jones following his widowerhood. He developed pneumonia after collecting seaweed from rockpools at Warrnambool, Victoria in May 1936, and during the journey to his home collapsed on the train at Albury, New South Wales. He was taken to a private hospital and died on 10 June 1936. His portrait by H. A. Hanke (1935) hangs in the Assembly Hall of the Sydney Grammar School. His autobiography, A. H. S. Lucas, scientist, His Own Story, was published in 1937.

The play is a noteworthy satire on the emerging ethos of Capitalism as reflected in real estate and urban development in the early modern city. The precise dates of authorship and first performance of the play are not known with certainty; but it must have originated c. 1632, when the development of Covent Garden was a public controversy. The play may have been staged by the King's Men.Corns, p. 200. The Weeding of Covent Garden was first published in the 1659 octavo volume Five New Plays, a collection of Brome's dramas issued by the booksellers Andrew Crooke and Henry Brome. Covent Garden Even in the first half of the 17th century, major urban developments were subjects of intense dispute. In both the Elizabethan and the Jacobean eras, regulations had been promulgated to control the urban sprawl that was then uniting London with nearby Westminster. The last open spaces between the two were under pressure in the early 17th century: the area of Lincoln's Inn Fields was partially developed, leaving Covent Garden ‚Äì the former \\"convent garden\\" attached to Westminster Abbey ‚Äî as the next obvious target for exploitation. In January 1631, the land's owner, Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford, obtained from King Charles I the waiver of the legal restrictions on new building that he needed for a large building project centred on a Continental-style piazza. (The waiver cost Bedford ¬£2000; Charles had dismissed Parliament and begun his eleven-year period of personal rule, and needed the money.) Inigo Jones While Isaac de Caux was the architect for the row houses on the north and east sides of the square, Inigo Jones designed St. Paul's Church on the square's west side. Moreover, Jones was then the King's Surveyor General, and must perforce have been involved in the overall design of the project.Leapman, pp. 279‚Äì85. For this reason, Brome chose to concentrate on Jones when crafting his satire on the greed of real-estate development and speculation. Brome, a longtime follower of Ben Jonson,Brome makes his allegiance and his debt to Jonson clear in Covent Garden Weeded: Cockbrain cites Adam Overdo from Bartholomew Fair as his \\"reverend ancestor.\\" must also have been influenced by the fact that Jonson's long-running battle of egos with Jones, in their unhappy partnership as masque makers for the Stuart Court, had come to a head in 1631 with Jones's victory and Jonson's defeat.Jones continued to design masques for the Court through the remainder of Charles's reign, but Jonson never wrote another for royalty. See: Chloridia. Brome focuses his satire on two figures, Rookbill the architect and Cockbrain the justice of the peace; both represent Inigo Jones, who at the time also served as a justice of the peace for Westminster and Middlesex.Leapman, pp. 221, 288‚Äì9. Place realism Brome was not the only playwright of his day to be attracted to this subject; Thomas Nabbes wrote his own Covent Garden, which was acted in 1633 and printed in 1638. Plays exploiting \\"place realism,\\" connections with real London landmarks and institutions, were common in the early 1630s, with Shackerley Marmion's Holland's Leaguer (1631), James Shirley's Hyde Park (1632), and Nabbes's Tottenham Court (1634) being good examples. Other of Brome's plays also participate in this theatrical fashion. The play The play is much more than a simple satire on a contemporary subject; its cast includes \\"a Puritan named Gabriel, a scarlet woman supposedly from Venice, various irate fathers and disguised lovers, and a group of hooligans known as 'The Brothers of the Blade,' whose expulsion gives the play its title.\\"Steggle, p. 46. In shaping this confection, Brome presents a closely observed slice of contemporaneous London life in a realistic setting.Steggle, pp. 47‚Äì50. The play has attracted critical comment for directing its satire both at fashionable society and at Puritans, and for the unusual scene of two prostitutes fighting each other with swords (Act IV, scene i). Some critics have complained of the play's \\"looseness of structure,\\" even asserting that it \\"has no main plot.\\"Schelling, Vol. 2, p. 272. NotesSources * Corns, Thomas N.

Vallery's facades, today of brick with stone quoins and details, were originally covered with red and black marble. Works at Vallery were interrupted by the king's death (1559), followed by that of the Mar√©chal (1562). Two years later his widow passed Vallery to Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Cond√©, who decorated the ceilings of the south wing: Francesco Primaticcio provided some of the internal decoration in the manner of his School of Fontainebleau.

Court would convene once per month, with judges and patrons travelling long distances to conduct business. Travelers needed an inn to provide meeting space, food, drink, and overnight stay as well as stables and food for the teams, horses, and mules. The Hanover County Courthouse is an operating courthouse, the third oldest still in use in the United States. Located along what is now historic U.S. Route 301, its site was adjacent to the original Shelton Tavern. Hanover County's greatest native son, Patrick Henry, married Sarah Shelton, the daughter of John & Eleanor Parks Shelton, the owners of the Tavern from 1750‚Äì1764. Henry assisted his father-in-law by greeting and serving guests, tending bar, and entertaining with his fiddle playing and warm personality. Working at the tavern exposed Henry to the legal world and in April 1760 at the age of 24, he obtained a license to practice law. Patrick Henry's great oratory skills and patriotic fervor were first recognized on December 1, 1763, when he delivered an impassioned speech during the damages phase of the Parson's Cause case. Across the street at Hanover Courthouse, he was the first to publicly challenge the authority of the King and question the true motives of the clergy representing the Church of England. This was one of the first signs of the revolutionary spirit growing in America. During the Revolutionary War, French officers Marquis de Lafayette, Marquis de Chastellux, and Rochambeau all enjoyed the hospitality of Tavern owner Paul Thilman. Chastellux referred to the tavern as a \\"Tolerable handsome inn, with a large salon and covered portico\\". In his diary, General George Washington twice refers to dining and lodging at Hanover Courthouse. The Civil War turned the Tavern into a home for refugees, fleeing the Union Army. Two such boarders were Margaret Wight and her husband John. While living at the Tavern, Margaret kept a diary, reporting on such things as news of the war, worries about her children, occurrences at the Tavern, and the price of food and clothing. In the opening paragraph of the diary, Margaret refers to the war as \\"this most unhappy contest, which is now at its height, between the two sections of our once happy country\\".Shirley A. Haas & Dale Paige Talley, eds. A Refugee at Hanover Tavern: The Civil War Diary of Margaret Wight. Charleston: The History Press, 2013. In 1800, seven slaves from Hanover Tavern took part in the planning of a failed slave insurrection known as Gabriel's Rebellion. Over the years, celebrated guests such as Chief Justice John Marshall, Edgar Allan Poe, P. T. Barnum, Charles Dickens, Union General Fitz John Porter, and Confederate generals J.E.B. Stuart and Wade Hampton visited this roadside fixture on the corridor between Richmond and Fredericksburg. The present tavern building, restored by the Hanover Tavern Foundation, dates from 1791 with early 19th century and late 20th century additions and is listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places. The original 1733 tavern building, having fallen into disrepair, was torn down after the construction of the 1822 section. By 1953, the tavern building was well-worn and possibly on its last legs. A group of young actors from New York bought the building and 3.5 acres with the intention of starting a dinner theater. They repaired the building to operate as their home and business, actually beginning the preservation of the old structure. The tavern was adapted as the first dinner theatre in America; Barksdale Theatre. It was the first performing arts organization in Virginia to seat integrated audiences. Barksdale Theatre merged with Theatre IV in 2012 to become Virginia Repertory Theatre.Prestidge, Holly: Richmond Times Dispatch May 20, 2012; Barksdale, Theatre IV merging Retrieved 2012-05-27Cushing, Nathan: RVA News May 20, 2012; Barksdale and Theatre IV join to create Virginia Repertory Theatre Retrieved 2012-05-27 Virginia Repertory Theatre still performs regularly at the Tavern, with dining options provided by the Hanover Tavern Restaurant & Pub, open for lunch and dinner Tuesday through Sunday. In 1990, the non-profit Hanover Tavern Foundation boughthttp://hanovertavern.org/foundation/foundation-history the Tavern and 3.5 acres from the Barksdale Theatre owners and began to raise the needed money to stabilize and restore the aging building. The Foundation's goal was to restore, preserve and utilize the Tavern as an historical, educational, community and cultural resource center for the general public. The Foundation raised over $5 million, stabilizing and restoring the historic building, added a wing for restrooms, a restaurant quality kitchen, new mechanical systems, and refurbished the theater. After successful fundraising campaigns and completion of the restoration, the building reopened to the public in 2005. The Tavern has been a vibrant center of community life at Hanover Courthouse for almost three hundred years. It remains a community centerpiece through the Foundation's continuing efforts to preserve the building and share its past history. Today, this cultural site offers student field trips, educational history programs, historical exhibits, heritage musical events, lecture series, and family-oriented special events like Hanover AutumnFest & 5K as well as a full-service restaurant and pub, meeting, wedding, party, and events space, and Virginia Repertory Theatre performances in a modern 150-seat theater.

It is the third instalment in the \\"Orked\\" trilogy.

It went on to have a final gross of almost RM2 million. Plot The story takes place in Sekinchan, Sabak Bernam in 1993, revolving around the first love of a 10-year-old Orked when a 12-year- old boy, Mukhsin, comes with his older brother and aunt to spend the school holidays in her village. Around this relatively simple plotline of a blossoming young romance between the film's two young protagonists, are interweaved scenes of Malaysian village life and the dynamics of different types of families. Most of the family scenes revolve around Orked, her parents Mak Inom and Pak Atan, and the family's close maid Kak Yam who is almost like a family member. The other families which are given attention in the movie are Mukhsin's family (with his elder brother who has lost his way in life and is trying desperately to find their mother who abandoned them at a young age, and their Aunty who is trying to take care of the two boys as though they were her own), and Orked's neighbours (with the young daughter and pregnant mother who are critical of the western ways of Orked's family, while they themselves are hurt by the father who wants to abandon them to take on a second wife).

It employs the first-person perspectives of several protagonists, Union and Confederate, to give a moment- by-moment depiction of the battle. Plot Summary and Characters Because the novel is divided into chapters, each closely concerned with one of the characters, a summary of the story serves as a character analysis as well. Chapter One takes place the day before the battle; it is narrated by Lieutenant Palmer Metcalfe, a cocky, 19 year old, aristocrat from New Orleans and a staff officer under Confederate commander Albert Sidney Johnston. He watches as the Confederate army marches through the Tennessee countryside in preparation for a surprise attack upon the Union troops at Pittsburg Landing. His self-satisfaction is evident as he remembers the complicated attack plan he helped draft, and as he thinks back on the struggles Johnston went through in bringing his army together for this decisive blow. The Confederate troops are inexperienced and noisy, and some of Johnston's generals believe the element of surprise has been lost. Johnston, however, insists on fighting whatever the conditions. Chapter Two is the story of Captain Walter Fountain, an Ohio regimental adjutant in the Union Army encamped at Pittsburg Landing. He is the Officer of the Day and whiles away the Tennessee night by writing a letter to his wife, Martha. Through his thoughts, the reader learns about the Union army's slow but steady advance through Tennessee under the resolute leadership of Ulysses Grant. Fountain is homesick but confident that the war will be over soon. He interacts with the regimental mascot, a dog named Bango. As he commits his feelings and hopes to paper, he begins to notice that the birds and other woodland creatures have become noisier and more agitated. Suddenly hundreds of Confederate soldiers burst out of the forest, charging headlong upon Fountain and the other unsuspecting union troops. The chapter ends abruptly, and the reader assumes that Fountain is killed in the initial assault. Chapter Three comes from the perspective of Private Luther Dade, a humble rifleman from Mississippi. He is frightened but determined to do his duty as his regiment prepares to join the battle. When the fight does come, Dade is disturbed when he realizes that the mangled corpses of old friends mean no more to him than those of strangers; the new horrors of the day are too much for him to process. He does well in combat but sustains a minor arm wound and is sent to a triage area to wait for a doctor. Hours pass, no doctor shows up, and Dade's arm begins to show signs of infection. He stumbles toward the sound of firing in search of medical attention and soon finds himself in a clearing near Shiloh Church. Others are there; Johnston's staff, gathered around their wounded and dying commander. Dade is transfixed by the drama of the scene, even as he begins to pass out from his wound. Chapter Four is narrated by Private Otto Flickner, a Minnesota artilleryman. It is the first night of the battle, and Flickner is cowering at the riverbank with hundreds of other deserters. He rationalizes his actions by claiming, \\"I'm not scared, I'm just what they call demoralized.\\" His search for justification leads him to remember the days events: the shattering surprise attack, one failed attempt after another to stand and fight, the endless concussions of oncoming enemy shells, and finally his running away because \\"so much is enough but a little bit more is too much.\\" He and the other deserters are jeered at and called cowards by some reinforcements that pass by; their words force Flickner to realize that a coward is exactly what he has been. Without any real conscious effort, he finds himself leaving the riverbank and wandering through the woods looking for his unit. Almost miraculously, he comes upon them getting ready for one last stand. His sergeant, who witnessed his desertion, greets him as if nothing had happened and directs him back to his old gun. Chapter Five concerns Sergeant Jefferson Polly, a Texas cavalryman serving under Nathan Bedford Forrest. A former seminary student and soldier of fortune, Polly joined the army by reasoning, \\"I wasn't any better at being a bad man than I was a good one.\\" His mature and cynical perspective tells him that the Confederate army, even though successful on the first day, is fighting a poorly planned and badly coordinated battle. That night, Forrest leads Polly and his squad on a reconnaissance mission to Pittsburg Landing. While there, they see thousands of Union reinforcements disembarking from steamboats; more men in themselves than are left in the whole Confederate army. Forrest and Polly try to alert the high command to the new danger, but fail in the face of confusion and red tape. With the next sunrise, Polly resigns himself to a day of defeat beside his beloved commander. Chapter Six focuses on an Indiana squad from the command of General Lew Wallace. The reader hears from all the twelve members in turn as they tell of their efforts to reach the battlefield, the wrong turn that delayed them for a day, and the scorn that was poured on them by other troops for their tardiness. When the battle's second day dawns, the Hoosiers and the rest of Wallace's division are at the forefront of the resurgent Federal assault. At the end of the fight, two of the Hoosiers are dead; the survivors wonder if they have any right to ask why they lived and the others did not. Chapter Seven returns to Lieutenant Metcalfe as he stumbles down the road to Corinth, just after the defeat of the Confederate army. He remembers the dramatic death of General Johnston: how events spun out of control in its aftermath, how the disorganized and leaderless Confederate army fell victim to a surprise Federal attack the next day, how Johnston's old-fashioned chivalry had been no match for the reality they had encountered. In the confusion of the retreat he falls in with Forrest and Polly and participates in their valiant rearguard action at Fallen Timbers. Metcalfe decides to join Forrest's unit as an enlisted man; he now believes that any hope the Confederacy has lies with men like Forrest rather than men like Johnston. The novel ends with Metcalfe tending to a delirious amputee in a wagon; the reader knows him to be Luther Dade. Style and Substance The book owes much to William Faulkner in the slow, elegant cadence of its storytelling. Its narrative also resembles Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage; a similarity reinforced by the fact that Foote wrote an introduction to an edition of Crane's work some forty years later. The story illustrates two of Foote's most strongly held convictions: that Nathan Bedford Forrest was the greatest combat commander in the American Civil War, and that Confederate society held the seeds of its own doom.

Xenakis used it on his subsequent piece Myc√®nes Alpha (1978) and two other works. It has also been used by composers such as Julio Estrada, (Eua¬¥on (1980)), Jean-Claude Risset (on Saxatile (1992)), Fran√ßois-Bernard M√¢che (Hyp√©rion (1981), Nocturne (1981), Tithon (1989), Moires (1994), Canop√©e (2003)), Takehito Shimazu (Illusions in Desolate Fields (1994)), G√©rard Pape (Le Fleuve du D√©sir III (1994)), and Curtis Roads (Purity (1994) and Sonal Atoms (1998)).

Its functionality is similar to that of the later Fairlight CMI, in that the user draws waveforms and volume envelopes on the tablet, which are rendered by the computer. Once the waveforms have been stored, the user can compose with them by drawing \\"compositions\\" on the tablet, with the X-axis representing time, and the Y-axis representing pitch. The compositions can be stretched in duration from a few seconds to an hour. They can also be transposed, reversed, inverted, and subject to a number of algorithmic transformations. The system allows for real time performance by moving the stylus across the tablet. The UPIC system has subsequently been expanded to allow for digitally sampled waveforms as source material, rather than purely synthesised tones. In 2005, Mode Records of New York released a 2-CD compilation of works composed with the UPIC at CCMIX, entitled Xenakis, UPIC, Continuum,\\"Xenakis, UPIC, Continuum\\", ModeRecords.com.

There were a couple of attempts to reproduce the UPIC system using commodity hardware, for instance Iannix, HighC, UPISketch. IanniX, which has been sponsored by the French Ministry of Culture, is a graphical open-source sequencer which syncs via Open Sound Control events and curves to a real-time environment (like Pure Data, SuperCollider, Csound, MaxMSP and openFrameworks among others). For its part, HighC is currently used as a pedagogical tool in classes ranging from early teens to Master classes in composition, while some contemporary composers, such as George Hatzimichelakis have made it part of their toolset. Another pedagogical tool, UPISketch, was inspired by the UPIC. The first version, released in 2018, runs on OSX and iOS. It was made possible thanks to a partnership between the Centre Iannis Xenakis and the European University of Cyprus, with funding from the Interfaces Project.

On formal occasions, adult male citizens could wear a woolen toga, draped over their tunic, and married citizen women wore a woolen mantle, known as a palla, over a stola, a simple, long-sleeved, voluminous garment that hung to midstep. Clothing, footwear and accoutrements identified gender, status, rank and social class. This was especially apparent in the distinctive, privileged official dress of magistrates, priesthoods and the military. The toga was considered Rome's \\"national costume\\" but for day-to-day activities, most Romans preferred more casual, practical and comfortable clothing; the tunic, in various forms, was the basic garment for all classes, both sexes and most occupations. It was usually made of linen, and was augmented as necessary with underwear, or with various kinds of cold-or-wet weather wear, such as knee-breeches for men, and cloaks, coats and hats. In colder parts of the empire, full length trousers were worn. Most urban Romans wore shoes, slippers, boots or sandals of various types; in the countryside, some wore clogs. Most clothing was simple in structure and basic form, and its production required minimal cutting and tailoring, but all was produced by hand and every process required skill, knowledge and time. Spinning and weaving were thought virtuous, frugal occupations for Roman women of all classes. Wealthy matrons, including Augustus' wife Livia, might show their traditionalist values by producing home-spun clothing, but most men and women who could afford it bought their clothing from specialist artisans. Relative to the overall basic cost of living, even simple clothing was expensive, and was recycled many times down the social scale. Rome's governing elite produced laws designed to limit public displays of personal wealth and luxury. None were particularly successful, as the same wealthy elite had an appetite for luxurious and fashionable clothing. Exotic fabrics were available, at a price; silk damasks, translucent gauzes, cloth of gold, and intricate embroideries; and vivid, expensive dyes such as saffron yellow or Tyrian purple. Not all dyes were costly, however, and most Romans wore colourful clothing. Clean, bright clothing was a mark of respectability and status among all social classes. The fastenings and brooches used to secure garments such as cloaks provided further opportunities for personal embellishment and display. Tunics and undergarments 4th-century mosaic from Villa del Casale, Sicily, showing \\"bikini girls\\" in an athletic contest The basic garment for both genders and all classes was the tunica (tunic). In its simplest form, the tunic was a single rectangle of woven fabric, originally woolen, but from the mid-republic onward, increasingly made from linen. It was sewn into a sleeveless tubular shape and pinned around the shoulders like a Greek chiton, to form openings for the neck and arms. In some examples from the eastern part of the empire, neck openings were formed in the weaving. Sleeves could be added. Most working men wore knee-length, short-sleeved tunics, secured at the waist with a belt. Some traditionalists considered long sleeved tunics appropriate only for women, very long tunics on men as a sign of effeminacy, and short or unbelted tunics as marks of servility; nevertheless, very long- sleeved, loosely belted tunics were also fashionably unconventional and were adopted by some Roman men; for example, by Julius Caesar. Women's tunics were usually ankle or foot-length, long-sleeved, and could be worn loosely or belted.Heskel, J., p. 134 in Sebesta For comfort and protection from cold, both sexes could wear a soft under-tunic or vest (subucula) beneath a coarser over-tunic; in winter, the Emperor Augustus, whose physique and constitution were never particularly robust, wore up to four tunics, over a vest.Suetonius, Augustus, 82 Although essentially simple in basic design, tunics could also be luxurious in their fabric, colours and detailing.Sebesta, J. L., pp. 71‚Äì72 in Sebesta Loincloths, known as subligacula or subligaria could be worn under a tunic. They could also be worn on their own, particularly by slaves who engaged in hot, sweaty or dirty work. Women wore both loincloth and strophium (a breast cloth) under their tunics; and some wore tailored underwear for work or leisure.Goldman, N., pp. 223 and 233 in Sebesta A 4th-century AD Sicillian mosaic shows several \\"bikini girls\\" performing athletic feats; in 1953 a Roman leather bikini bottom was excavated from a well in London.

Blackwell Publishing. The statue features an inscription in the Etruscan alphabet Silenus holding a lyre (left); demi-god Pan and a nymph sitting on a rock, nursing a goat (centre); woman with coat (right); fresco from the Villa of the Mysteries, Pompeii, Italy, c. 50 BC Roman society was graded into several citizen and non-citizen classes and ranks, ruled by a powerful minority of wealthy, landowning citizen-aristocrats. Even the lowest grade of citizenship carried certain privileges denied to non-citizens, such as the right to vote for representation in government. In tradition and law, an individual's place in the citizen-hierarchy ‚Äì or outside it ‚Äì should be immediately evident in their clothing. The seating arrangements at theatres and games enforced this idealised social order, with varying degrees of success. In literature and poetry, Romans were the gens togata (\\"togate race\\"), descended from a tough, virile, intrinsically noble peasantry of hard-working, toga-wearing men and women. The toga's origins are uncertain; it may have begun as a simple, practical work-garment and blanket for peasants and herdsmen. It eventually became formal wear for male citizens; at much the same time, respectable female citizens adopted the stola. The morals, wealth and reputation of citizens were subject to official scrutiny. Male citizens who failed to meet a minimum standard could be demoted in rank, and denied the right to wear a toga; by the same token, female citizens could be denied the stola. Respectable citizens of either sex might thus be distinguished from freedmen, foreigners, slaves and infamous persons.Edmondson, J. C., p. 25 in Edmondson Toga The toga virilis (\\"toga of manhood\\") was a semi-elliptical, white woolen cloth some 6 feet in width and 12 feet in length, draped across the shoulders and around the body. It was usually worn over a plain white linen tunic. A commoner's toga virilis was a natural off-white; the senatorial version was more voluminous, and brighter. The toga praetexta of curule magistrates and some priesthoods added a wide purple edging, and was worn over a tunic with two vertical purple stripes. It could also be worn by noble and freeborn boys and girls, and represented their protection under civil and divine law. Equites wore the trabea (a shorter, \\"equestrian\\" form of white toga or a purple-red wrap, or both) over a white tunic with two narrow vertical purple-red stripes. The toga pulla, used for mourning, was made of dark wool. The rare, prestigious toga picta and tunica palmata were purple, embroidered with gold. They were originally awarded to Roman generals for the day of their triumph, but became official dress for emperors and Imperial consuls. From at least the late Republic onward, the upper classes favoured ever longer and larger togas, increasingly unsuited to manual work or physically active leisure. Togas were expensive, heavy, hot and sweaty, hard to keep clean, costly to launder and challenging to wear correctly. They were best suited to stately processions, oratory, sitting in the theatre or circus, and self-display among peers and inferiors while \\"ostentatiously doing nothing\\" at salutationes.Braund, Susanna, and Osgood, Josiah, eds. (2012) A Companion to Persius and Juvenal, Wiley-Blackwell, p. 79. These early morning, formal \\"greeting sessions\\" were an essential part of Roman life, in which clients visited their patrons, competing for favours or investment in business ventures. A client who dressed well and correctly ‚Äì in his toga, if a citizen ‚Äì showed respect for himself and his patron, and might stand out among the crowd. A canny patron might equip his entire family, his friends, freedmen, even his slaves, with elegant, costly and impractical clothing, implying his entire extended family's condition as one of \\"honorific leisure\\" (otium), buoyed by limitless wealth.Braund, Susanna, and Osgood, Josiah eds. (2012) A Companion to Persius and Juvenal, Wiley-Blackwell. p. 65. The vast majority of citizens had to work for a living, and avoided wearing the toga whenever possible.Vout, pp. 205‚Äì208cf. the description of Roman clothing, including the toga, as \\"simple and elegant, practical and comfortable\\" by Goldman, B., p. 217 in Sebesta Several emperors tried to compel its use as the public dress of true Romanitas but none were particularly successful.Edmondson, J. C., p. 96 in Edmondson The aristocracy clung to it as a mark of their prestige, but eventually abandoned it for the more comfortable and practical pallium. Stola and palla Roman marble torso from the 1st century AD, showing a woman's clothing Besides tunics, married citizen women wore a simple garment known as a stola (pl. stolae) which was associated with traditional Roman female virtues, especially modesty.Harlow, M.E. ‚ÄòDressing to please themselves: clothing choices for Roman Women‚Äô in Harlow, M.E. (ed.) Dress and identity (University of Birmingham IAA Interdisciplinary Series: Studies in Archaeology, History, Literature and Art 2), 2012, Archaeopress, pp. 39 In the early Roman Republic, the stola was reserved for patrician women. Shortly before the Second Punic War, the right to wear it was extended to plebeian matrons, and to freedwomen who had acquired the status of matron through marriage to a citizen. Stolae typically comprised two rectangular segments of cloth joined at the side by fibulae and buttons in a manner allowing the garment to be draped in elegant but concealing folds.Sebesta, J. L., pp. 48‚Äì50 in Sebesta Over the stola, citizen-women often wore the palla, a sort of rectangular shawl up to 11 feet long, and five wide. It could be worn as a coat, or draped over the left shoulder, under the right arm, and then over the left arm. Outdoors and in public, a chaste matron's hair was bound up in woolen bands (fillets, or vitae) in a high-piled style known as tutulus. Her face was concealed from the public, male gaze with a veil; her palla could also serve as a hooded cloak.Roman Clothing, Part II. Vroma.org. Retrieved on 2012-07-25.Goldman, N., p. 228 in Sebesta Two ancient literary sources mention use of a coloured strip or edging (a limbus) on a woman's \\"mantle\\", or on the hem of their tunic; probably a mark of their high status, and presumably purple.Sebesta, J. L., pp. 67, 245 in Sebesta: citing Nonius M 541, Servius, In Aeneadem, 2.616, 4.137 Outside the confines of their homes, matrons were expected to wear veils; a matron who appeared without a veil was held to have repudiated her marriage.Sebesta, J. L., p. 49 in Sebesta High-caste women convicted of adultery, and high-class female prostitutes (meretrices), were not only forbidden public use of the stola, but might have been expected to wear a toga muliebris (a \\"woman's toga\\") as a sign of their infamy.Edwards, Catharine (1997) \\"Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome\\", pp. 81‚Äì82 in Roman Sexualities. Princeton University Press. Vout, pp. 205‚Äì208, 215, citing Servius, In Aenidem, 1.281 and Nonius, 14.867L for the former wearing of togas by women other than prostitutes and adulteresses. Some modern scholars doubt the \\"togate adulteress\\" as more than literary and social invective: cf Dixon, J., in Harlow, M., and Nosch, M-L., (Editors) Greek and Roman Textiles and Dress: An Interdisciplinary Anthology, Oxbow Books, 2014, pp. 298‚Äì304. Some, on similar grounds, doubt both the \\"togate adulteress\\" and the \\"togate meretrix\\": see Knapp, Robert, Invisible Romans, Profile Books, 2013, pp. 256 ‚Äì 257, citing Horace, Satires 1.2.63, 82., and Sulpicia (in Tibullus, Elegies, 3.16.3 ‚Äì 4) Freedmen, freedwomen and slaves For citizens, salutationes meant wearing the toga appropriate to their rank.Vout, p. 216 For freedmen, it meant whatever dress disclosed their status and wealth; a man should be what he seemed, and low rank was no bar to making money. Freedmen were forbidden to wear any kind of toga. Elite invective mocked the aspirations of wealthy, upwardly mobile freedmen who boldly flouted this prohibition, donned a toga, or even the trabea of an equites, and inserted themselves as equals among their social superiors at the games and theatres. If detected, they were evicted from their seats.Edmondson, J., pp. 31‚Äì34 in Edmondson Notwithstanding the commonplace snobbery and mockery of their social superiors, some freedmen and freedwomen were highly cultured, and most would have had useful personal and business connections through their former master. Those with an aptitude for business could amass a fortune; and many did. They could function as patrons in their own right, fund public and private projects, own grand town-houses, and \\"dress to impress\\".Clarke, John R. (1992) The Houses of Roman Italy, 100 BC-AD 250. Ritual, Space and Decoration. University Presses of California, Columbia and Princeton. p. 4. For more general discussion see Wilson, A., and Flohr, M. eds. (2016) Urban Craftsmen and Traders in the Roman World. Oxford University Press. pp. 101‚Äì110. There was no standard costume for slaves; they might dress well, badly, or barely at all, depending on circumstance and the will of their owner. Urban slaves in prosperous households might wear some form of livery; cultured slaves who served as household tutors might be indistinguishable from well-off freedmen. Slaves serving out in the mines might wear nothing. For Appian, a slave dressed as well as his master signalled the end of a stable, well-ordered society. According to Seneca, tutor to Nero, a proposal that all slaves be made to wear a particular type of clothing was abandoned, for fear that the slaves should realise both their own overwhelming numbers, and the vulnerability of their masters. Advice to farm- owners by Cato the Elder and Columella on the regular supply of adequate clothing to farm-slaves was probably intended to mollify their otherwise harsh conditions, and maintain their obedience.Appian Civil Wars, 2.120; Seneca, On Mercy, 1. 24. 1Bradley, Keith R. (1987) Slaves and Masters in the Roman Empire: A Study in Social Control. Oxford University Press. pp. 21‚Äì23. Children and adolescents Roman infants were usually swaddled. Apart from those few, typically formal garments reserved for adults, most children wore a scaled-down version of what their parents wore. Girls often wore a long tunic that reached the foot or instep, belted at the waist and very simply decorated, most often white. Outdoors, they might wear another tunic over it. Boys' tunics were shorter. Boys and girls wore amulets to protect them from immoral or baleful influences such as the evil eye and sexual predation. For boys, the amulet was a bulla, worn around the neck; the equivalent for girls was a crescent-shaped lunula. The toga praetexta, which was thought to offer similar apotropaic protection, was formal wear for freeborn boys until puberty, when they gave their toga praetexta and childhood bulla into the care of their family lares and put on the adult male's toga virilis. According to some Roman literary sources, freeborn girls might also wear ‚Äì or at least, had the right to wear ‚Äì a toga praetexta until marriage, when they offered their childhood toys, and perhaps their maidenly praetexta to Fortuna Virginalis; others claim a gift made to the family Lares, or to Venus, as part of their passage to adulthood. In traditionalist families, unmarried girls might be expected to wear their hair demurely bound in a fillet.Hersch, Karen K. (2010) The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity. Cambridge University Press. pp. 66‚Äì67. Sebesta, J. L., p. 47 in Sebesta Notwithstanding such attempts to protect the maidenly virtue of Roman girls, there is little anecdotal or artistic evidence of their use or effective imposition. Some unmarried daughters of respectable families seem to have enjoyed going out and about in flashy clothing, jewellery, perfume and make-up;Olson, Kelly (2008) Dress and the Roman Woman: Self-Presentation and Society. Routledge. pp. 16‚Äì20. and some parents, anxious to find the best and wealthiest possible match for their daughters, seem to have encouraged it.Olson, Kelly, pp. 143‚Äì149 in Edmondson Footwear Romans used a wide variety of practical and decorative footwear, all of it flat soled (without heels). Outdoor shoes were often hobnailed for grip and durability. The most common types of footwear were a one-piece shoe (carbatina), sometimes with semi-openwork uppers; a usually thin-soled sandal (solea), secured with thongs; a laced, soft half- shoe (soccus); a usually hobnailed, thick-soled walking shoe (calcea); and a heavy-duty, hobnailed standard-issue military marching boot (caliga). Thick- soled wooden clogs, with leather uppers, were available for use in wet weather, and by rustics and field-slavesGoldman, N., pp. 105‚Äì113 in Sebesta Shoemakers employed sophisticated strapwork and delicate cutting to create intricate decorative patterns. Indoors, most reasonably well-off Romans of both sexes wore slippers or light shoes of felt or leather. Brides on their wedding-day may have worn distinctively orange-coloured light soft shoes or slippers (lutei socci).Stone, S., in Edmondson, J. C., p. 27 in Edmondson; see also Colours and dyes in this article. Public protocol required red ankle boots for senators, and shoes with crescent-shaped buckles for equites, though some wore Greek-style sandals to \\"go with the crowd\\".Shumba, L., in Edmondson, J. C., and Keith, A., (Editors), Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture, University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 191Edmonson, J. C., pp. 45‚Äì47 and note 75 in Edmondson Costly footwear was a mark of wealth or status, but being completely unshod need not be a mark of poverty. Cato the younger showed his impeccable Republican morality by going publicly barefoot; many images of the Roman gods, and later, statues of the semi-divine Augustus, were unshod.Stone, S., p. 16 in SebestaStout, A. M., p. 93 in Sebesta: the gods needed no footwear, having \\"no need to touch the ground\\" Fashions in footwear reflected changes in social conditions. For example, during the unstable middle Imperial era, the military was overtly favoured as the true basis for power; at around this time, a so-called \\"Gallic sandal\\" ‚Äì up to 4 inches broad at the toe ‚Äì developed as outdoor wear for men and boys, reminiscent of the military boot. Meanwhile, outdoor footwear for women, young girls and children remained elegantly pointed at the toe. Military costume Levy of the army during the taking of the Roman census, detail from the marble-sculpted Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus, 122‚Äì115 BC, showing two Polybian-era soldiers (pedites) wearing chain mail and wielding a gladius and scutum, opposite an aristocratic cavalryman (eques) Mars from the Forum of Nerva, wearing a plumed Corinthian helmet and muscle cuirass, 2nd century AD For the most part, common soldiers seem to have dressed in belted, knee-length tunics for work or leisure. In the northern provinces, the traditionally short sleeved tunic might be replaced by a warmer, long-sleeved version. Soldiers on active duty wore short trousers under a military kilt, sometimes with a leather jerkin or felt padding to cushion their armour, and a triangular scarf tucked in at the neck. For added protection from wind and weather, they could wear the sagum, a heavy-duty cloak also worn by civilians. According to Roman tradition, soldiers had once worn togas to war, hitching them up with what was known as a \\"Gabine cinch\\"; but by the mid-Republican era, this was only used for sacrificial rites and a formal declaration of war.Stone, S., p. 13 in Sebesta Thereafter, citizen- soldiers wore togas only for formal occasions. Cicero's \\"sagum-wearing\\" soldiers versus \\"toga-wearing\\" civilians are rhetorical and literary trope, referring to a wished-for transition from military might to peaceful, civil authority.Phang, pp. 82‚Äì83Duggan, John, Making a New Man: Ciceronian Self- Fashioning in the Rhetorical Works, Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 61‚Äì65, citing Cicero's Ad Pisonem (Against Piso). When on duty in the city, the Praetorian guard concealed their weapons beneath their white \\"civilian\\" togas.Phang, pp. 77‚Äì78 The sagum distinguished common soldiers from the highest ranking commanders, who wore a larger, purple-red cloak, the paludamentum.Sebesta, pp. 133, 191 The colour of the ranker's sagum is uncertain.Its modern recreation as an intense red, or indeed any shade of red, is based on slender, unreliable literary evidence; see Phang, pp. 82‚Äì83 Roman military clothing was probably less uniform and more adaptive to local conditions and supplies than is suggested by its idealised depictions in contemporary literature, statuary and monuments.The columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius represent such idealised forms of military clothing and armour. Nevertheless, Rome's levies abroad were supposed to represent Rome in her purest form; provincials were supposed to adopt Roman ways, not vice versa. Even when foreign garments ‚Äì such as trousers ‚Äì proved more practical than standard issue, soldiers and commanders who used them were viewed with disdain and alarm by their more conservative compatriots, for undermining Rome's military virtus by \\"going native\\".Phang, pp. 94‚Äì95Erdkamp, pp. 237, 541 In Mediterranean climates, soldiers typically wore hobnailed \\"open boots\\" (caligae). In colder and wetter climates, an enclosing \\"shoeboot\\" was preferred.Goldman, N., pp. 122, 125 in Sebesta Some of the Vindolanda tablets mention the despatch of clothing ‚Äì including cloaks, socks, and warm underwear ‚Äì by families to their relatives, serving at Brittania's northern frontier.Bowman, Alan K (1994) Life and Letters on the Roman Frontier, British Museum Press. pp. 45‚Äì46, 71‚Äì72. During the early and middle Republican era, conscripted soldiers and their officers were expected to provide or pay for all their personal equipment. From the late republic onwards, they were salaried professionals, and bought their own clothing from legionary stores, quartermasters or civilian contractors. Military needs were prioritised. Clothing was expensive to start with, and the military demand was high; this inevitably pushed up prices, and a common soldier's clothing expenses could be more than a third of his annual pay. In the rampant inflation of the later Imperial era, as currency and salaries were devalued, deductions from military salaries for clothing and other staples were replaced by payments in kind, leaving common soldiers cash-poor, but adequately clothed.Erdkamp, pp. 81, 83, 310‚Äì312 Religious offices and ceremonies Most priesthoods were reserved to high status, male Roman citizens, usually magistrates or ex-magistrates. Most traditional religious rites required that the priest wore a toga praetexta, in a manner described as capite velato (head covered [by a fold of the toga]) when performing augury, reciting prayers or supervising at sacrifices.Palmer, Robert (1996) \\"The Deconstruction of Mommsen on Festus 462/464, or the Hazards of Interpretation\\", p. 83 in Imperium sine fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic. Franz Steiner. Where a rite prescribed the free use of both arms, the priest could employ the cinctus Gabinus (\\"Gabine cinch\\") to tie back the toga's inconvenient folds.Scheid, John (2003) An Introduction to Roman Religion. Indiana University Press, p. 80. Virgo Vestalis Maxima (Senior Vestal) The Vestal Virgins tended Rome's sacred fire, in Vesta's temple, and prepared essential sacrificial materials employed by different cults of the Roman state. They were highly respected, and possessed unique rights and privileges; their persons were sacred and inviolate. Their presence was required at various religious and civil rites and ceremonies. Their costume was predominantly white, woolen, and had elements in common with high- status Roman bridal dress. They wore a white, priestly infula, a white suffibulum (veil) and a white palla, with red ribbons to symbolise their devotion to Vesta's sacred fire, and white ribbons as a mark of their purity.Wildfang, R. L. (2006) Rome's Vestal Virgins: A Study of Rome's Vestal Priestesses in the Late Republic and Early Empire, Routledge, p. 54. Musei Capitolini The Flamen priesthood was dedicated to various deities of the Roman state. They wore a close-fitting, rounded cap (Apex) topped with a spike of olive-wood; and the laena, a long, semi-circular \\"flame-coloured\\" cloak fastened at the shoulder with a brooch or fibula. Their senior was the Flamen dialis, who was the high priest of Jupiter and was married to the Flamenica dialis. He was not allowed to divorce, leave the city, ride a horse, touch iron, or see a corpse. The laena was thought to predate the toga.Goldman, N., pp. 229‚Äì230 in Sebesta The twelve Salii (\\"leaping priests\\" of Mars) were young patrician men, who processed through the city in a form of war-dance during the festival of Mars, singing the Carmen Saliare. They too wore the apex, but otherwise dressed as archaic warriors, in embroidered tunics and breastplates. Each carried a sword, wore a short, red military cloak (paludamentum) and ritually struck a bronze shield, whose ancient original was said to have fallen from heaven.Smith, William; Wayte, William and Marindin, G. E. (1890). A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities. Albemarle Street, London. John Murray. Rome recruited many non-native deities, cults and priesthoods as protectors and allies of the state. Aesculapius, Apollo, Ceres and Proserpina were worshiped using the so-called \\"Greek rite\\", which employed Greek priestly dress, or a Romanised version of it. The priest presided in Greek fashion, with his head bare or wreathed.Robert Schilling, \\"Roman Sacrifice\\", Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 78. In 204 BC, the Galli priesthood were brought to Rome from Phrygia, to serve the \\"Trojan\\" Mother Goddess Cybele and her consort Attis on behalf of the Roman state. They were legally protected but flamboyantly \\"un-Roman\\". They were eunuchs, and told fortunes for money; their public rites were wild, frenzied and bloody, and their priestly garb was \\"womanly\\". They wore long, flowing robes of yellow silk, extravagant jewellery, perfume and make-up, and turbans or exotic versions of the \\"phrygian\\" hat over long, bleached hair.Beard, Mary (1994) \\"The Roman and the Foreign: The Cult of the \\"Great Mother\\" in Imperial Rome\\", pp. 164‚Äì190 in Thomas, N., and Humphrey, C., (eds) Shamanism, History and the State, Anne Arbor, The University of Michigan Press.

Roman clothing of Late Antiquity (after 284 AD) Roman fashions underwent very gradual change from the late Republic to the end of the Western empire, 600 years later.Rodgers, p. 490 In part, this reflects the expansion of Rome's empire, and the adoption of provincial fashions perceived as attractively exotic, or simply more practical than traditional forms of dress. Changes in fashion also reflect the increasing dominance of a military elite within government, and a corresponding reduction in the value and status of traditional civil offices and ranks. In the later empire after Diocletian's reforms, clothing worn by soldiers and non-military government bureaucrats became highly decorated, with woven or embellished strips, clavi, and circular roundels, orbiculi, added to tunics and cloaks. These decorative elements usually comprised geometrical patterns and stylised plant motifs, but could include human or animal figures.Sumner, Graham (2003). Roman Military clothing (2) AD 200 to 400. Osprey Publishing. pp. 7‚Äì9. . The use of silk also increased steadily and most courtiers in late antiquity wore elaborate silk robes. Heavy military-style belts were worn by bureaucrats as well as soldiers, revealing the general militarization of late Roman government. Trousers ‚Äî considered barbarous garments worn by Germans and Persians ‚Äî achieved only limited popularity in the latter days of the empire, and were regarded by conservatives as a sign of cultural decay.Rodgers, p. 491 The toga, traditionally seen as the sign of true Romanitas, had never been popular or practical. Most likely, its official replacement in the East by the more comfortable pallium and paenula simply acknowledged its disuse.Vout, pp. 212‚Äì213 In early medieval Europe, kings and aristocrats dressed like the late Roman generals they sought to emulate, not like the older toga-clad senatorial tradition.Wickham, Chris. The Inheritance of Rome, Penguin Books, 2009, p. 106 Fabrics An elaborately-designed golden fibula (brooch) with the Latin inscription \\"VTERE FELIX\\" (\\"use [this] with luck\\"), late 3rd century AD, from the Osztropataka Vandal burial site Animal fibresWool= Wool was the most commonly used fibre in Roman clothing. The sheep of Tarentum were renowned for the quality of their wool, although the Romans never ceased trying to optimise the quality of wool through cross-breeding. Miletus in Asia Minor and the province of Gallia Belgica were also renowned for the quality of their wool exports, the latter producing a heavy, rough wool suitable for winter. For most garments, white wool was preferred; it could then be further bleached, or dyed. Naturally dark wool was used for the toga pulla and work garments subjected to dirt and stains.Sebesta, J. L., p. 66 in Sebesta In the provinces, private landowners and the State held large tracts of grazing land, where large numbers of sheep were raised and sheared. Their wool was processed and woven in dedicated manufactories. Britannia was noted for its woolen products, which included a kind of duffel coat (the Birrus Brittanicus), fine carpets, and felt linings for army helmets. =Silk= A maenad wearing a silk gown, a Roman fresco from the Casa del Naviglio in Pompeii, 1st century AD Silk from China was imported in significant quantities as early as the 3rd century BC. It was bought in its raw state by Roman traders at the Phoenician ports of Tyre and Beirut, then woven and dyed. As Roman weaving techniques developed, silk yarn was used to make geometrically or freely figured damask, tabbies and tapestry. Some of these silk fabrics were extremely fine ‚Äì around 50 threads or more per centimeter. Production of such highly decorative, costly fabrics seems to have been a speciality of weavers in the eastern Roman provinces, where the earliest Roman horizontal looms were developed. Various sumptuary laws and price controls were passed to limit the purchase and use of silk. In the early Empire the Senate passed legislation forbidding the wearing of silk by men because it was viewed as effeminateWhitfield, Susan (1999) Life Along the Silk Road, Berkeley University of California Press. p. 21. . but there was also a connotation of immorality or immodesty attached to women who wore the material, as illustrated by Seneca the Elder: \\"I can see clothes of silk, if materials that do not hide the body, nor even one's decency, can be called clothes... Wretched flocks of maids labour so that the adulteress may be visible through her thin dress, so that her husband has no more acquaintance than any outsider or foreigner with his wife's body.\\" (Declamations Vol. 1) The Emperor Aurelian is said to have forbidden his wife to buy a mantle of Tyrian purple silk. The Historia Augusta claims that the emperor Elagabalus was the first Roman to wear garments of pure silk (holoserica) as opposed to the usual silk/cotton blends (subserica); this is presented as further evidence of his notorious decadence. Moral dimensions aside, Roman importation and expenditure on silk represented a significant, inflationary drain on Rome's gold and silver coinage, to the benefit of foreign traders and loss to the empire. Diocletian's Edict on Maximum Prices of 301 AD set the price of one kilo of raw silk at 4,000 gold coins. Wild silk, cocoons collected from the wild after the insect had eaten its way out, was also known;Pliny Nat.His XI, 75‚Äì77 being of shorter, smaller lengths, its fibres had to be spun into somewhat thicker yarn than the cultivated variety. A rare luxury cloth with a beautiful golden sheen, known as sea silk, was made from the long silky filaments or byssus produced by Pinna nobilis, a large Mediterranean clam.\\"The project Sea-silk ‚Äì Rediscovering an Ancient Textile Material.\\" Archaeological Textiles Newsletter, Number 35, Autumn 2002, p. 10. Plant fibresLinen= Pliny the Elder describes the production of linen from flax and hemp. After harvesting, the plant stems were retted to loosen the outer layers and internal fibres, stripped, pounded and then smoothed. Following this, the materials were woven. Flax, like wool, came in various speciality grades and qualities. In Pliny's opinion, the whitest (and best) was imported from Spanish Saetabis; at double the price, the strongest and most long-lasting was from Retovium. The whitest and softest was produced in Latium, Falerii and Paelignium. Natural linen was a \\"greyish brown\\" that faded to off-white through repeated laundering and exposure to sunlight. It did not readily absorb the dyes in use at the time, and was generally bleached, or used in its raw, undyed state.Sebesta, J. L., pp. 66, 72 in Sebesta =Other plant fibres= Cotton from India was imported through the same Eastern Mediterranean ports that supplied Roman traders with silk and spices. Raw cotton was sometimes used for padding. Once its seeds were removed, cotton could be spun, then woven into a soft, lightweight fabric appropriate for summer use; cotton was more comfortable than wool, less costly than silk, and unlike linen, it could be brightly dyed; for this reason, cotton and linen were sometimes interwoven to produce vividly coloured, soft but tough fabric.Sebesta, J. L., pp. 68‚Äì72 in Sebesta High quality fabrics were also woven from nettle stems; poppy-stem fibre was sometimes interwoven with flax, to produce a glossy smooth, lightweight and luxuriant fabric. Preparation of such stem fibres involved similar techniques to those used for linen.Stone, S., p. 39, and note 9 in Sebesta, citing Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 8.74.195 Manufacture Ready-made clothing was available for all classes, at a price; the cost of a new cloak for an ordinary commoner might represent three fifths of their annual subsistence expenses. Clothing was recycled down the social scale, until it fell to rags; even these were useful, and (\\"patch- workers\\") made a living by sewing clothing and other items from recycled fabric patches.Vout, pp. 211, 212. Owners of slave-run farms and sheep-flocks were advised that whenever the opportunity arose, female slaves should be fully occupied in the production of homespun woolen cloth; this would likely be good enough for clothing the better class of slave or supervisor.The notoriously parsimonious Cato the Elder, in his De Agri Cultura, 57, advises that slaves on farming estates be given a cloak and tunic every two years. Columella gives similar advice, adding that while homespun would likely be \\"too good\\" for the lowest class of rustic slave, it would not be good enough for their masters; but cf Augustus' pride in his homespun clothes. Sebesta, J. L., p. 70 in Sebesta, citing Columella, 12, praef. 9‚Äì10, 12.3.6 Self- sufficiency in clothing paid off. The carding, combing, spinning and weaving of wool were part of daily housekeeping for most women. Those of middling or low income could supplement their personal or family income by spinning and selling yarn, or by weaving fabric for sale. In traditionalist, wealthy households, the family's wool-baskets, spindles and looms were positioned in the semi-public reception area (atrium), where the mater familias and her familia could thus demonstrate their industry and frugality; a largely symbolic and moral activity for those of their class, rather than practical necessity.In reality, she was the female equivalent of the romanticised citizen-farmer: Flower, pp. 153, 195‚Äì197 Augustus was particularly proud that his wife and daughter had set the best possible example to other Roman women by spinning and weaving his clothing.Flower, pp. 153‚Äì154, citing Suetonius, Life of Augustus, 73 High-caste brides were expected to make their own wedding garments, using a traditional vertical loom.Sebesta, J. L., pp. 55‚Äì61 in Sebesta Most fabric and clothing was produced by professionals whose trades, standards and specialities were protected by guilds; these in turn were recognised and regulated by local authorities. Pieces were woven as closely as possible to their intended final shape, with minimal waste, cutting and sewing thereafter. Once a woven piece of fabric was removed from the loom, its loose end-threads were tied off, and left as a decorative fringe, hemmed, or used to add differently coloured \\"Etruscan style\\" borders, as in the purple-red border of the toga praetexta, and the vertical coloured stripe of some tunics;Goldman, B., p. 221 in Sebesta a technique known as \\"tablet weaving\\".Meyers, G. E. (2016) p. 331 in Bell, S., and Carpino, A. A. (eds) A Companion to the Etruscans. Blackwell Publishing. Weaving on an upright, hand-powered loom was a slow process. The earliest evidence for the transition from vertical to more efficient horizontal, foot-powered looms comes from Egypt, around 298 AD. Even then, the lack of mechanical aids in spinning made yarn production a major bottleneck in the manufacture of cloth. Colours and dyes From Rome's earliest days, a wide variety of colours and coloured fabrics would have been available; in Roman tradition, the first association of professional dyers dated back to the days of King Numa. Roman dyers would certainly have had access to the same locally produced, usually plant-based dyes as their neighbours on the Italian peninsula, producing various shades of red, yellow, blue, green, and brown; blacks could be achieved using iron salts and oak gall. Other dyes, or dyed cloths, could have been obtained by trade, or through experimentation. For the very few who could afford it, cloth-of- gold (lam√©) was almost certainly available, possibly as early as the 7th century BC.Sebesta, J. L., pp. 62‚Äì68 in Sebesta Throughout the Regal, Republican and Imperial eras, the fastest, most expensive and sought-after dye was imported Tyrian purple, obtained from the murex. Its hues varied according to processing, the most desirable being a dark \\"dried-blood\\" red.Bradley, Mark (2011) Colour and Meaning in Ancient Rome. Cambridge University Press. pp. 189, 194‚Äì195. Purple had long-standing associations with regality, and with the divine. It was thought to sanctify and protect those who wore it, and was officially reserved for the border of the toga praetexta, and for the solid purple toga picta. Edicts against its wider, more casual use were not particularly successful; it was also used by wealthy women and, somewhat more disreputably, by some men.Edmonson, J. C., pp. 28‚Äì30 and note 75 in EdmondsonKeith, A., in Edmonson, J. C., and Keith, A., (Editors), Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture, University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 200 Verres is reported as wearing a purple pallium at all-night parties, not long before his trial, disgrace and exile for corruption. For those who could not afford genuine Tyrian purple, counterfeits were available.Sebesta, J., L., pp. 54‚Äì56 in Sebesta The expansion of trade networks during the early Imperial era brought the dark blue of Indian indigo to Rome; though desirable and costly in itself, it also served as a base for fake Tyrian purple.Sebesta, J. L., pp. 68‚Äì69 in Sebesta, citing Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 33.163, 35.43, 35.46, 37.84, and Vitruvius, On architecture, 7.9.8, 7.14; as indigo was imported as \\"bricks\\" of dye-powder, Vitruvius believed it a mineral. For red hues, madder was one of the cheapest dyes available. Saffron yellow was much admired, but costly. It was a deep, bright and fiery yellow-orange, and was associated with purity and constancy. It was used for the flammeum (meaning \\"flame-coloured\\"), a veil used by Roman brides and the Flamenica Dialis, who was virgin at marriage and forbidden to divorce.La Follette, L., pp. 54‚Äì56 in Sebesta Specific colours were associated with chariot-racing teams and their supporters. The oldest of these were the Reds and the Whites. During the later Imperial era, the Blues and Greens dominated chariot-racing and, up to a point, civil and political life in Rome and Constantinople. Although the teams and their supporters had official recognition, their rivalry sometimes spilled into civil violence and riot, both within and beyond the circus venue.Sebesta, J. L., pp. 70‚Äì71 in Sebesta Leather and hide The Romans had two methods of converting animal skins to leather: tanning produced a soft, supple brown leather; tawing in alum and salt produced a soft, pale leather that readily absorbed dyes. Both these processes produced a strong, unpleasant odour, so tanners‚Äô and tawers‚Äô shops were usually placed well away from urban centres. Unprocessed animal hides were supplied directly to tanners by butchers, as a byproduct of meat production; some was turned to rawhide, which made a durable shoe-sole. Landowners and livestock ranchers, many of whom were of the elite class, drew a proportion of profits at each step of the process that turned their animals into leather or hide and distributed it through empire-wide trade networks. The Roman military consumed large quantities of leather; for jerkins, belts, boots, saddles, harness and strap-work, but mostly for military tents.Goldman, N., pp. 104‚Äì106 in SebestaErdkamp, pp. 316, 327 Laundering and fulling fuller's shop (fullonica) at Pompeii The almost universal habit of public bathing ensured that most Romans kept their bodies clean, reducing the need for frequent washing of garments and bedsheets. Nevertheless, dirt, spillage and staining were constant hazards, and most Romans lived in apartment blocks that lacked facilities for washing clothes on any but the smallest scale. Professional laundries (fullonicae, singular fullonica) were highly malodorous but essential and commonplace features of every city and town. Small fulling enterprises could be found at local market- places; others operated on an industrial scale, and would have required a considerable investment of money and manpower, especially slaves.Flohr, pp. 31‚Äì34, 68‚Äì72 Basic laundering and fulling techniques were simple, and labour- intensive. Garments were placed in large tubs containing aged urine, then well trodden by bare-footed workers. They were well-rinsed, manually or mechanically wrung, and spread over wicker frames to dry. Whites could be further brightened by bleaching with sulphur fumes. Some colours could be restored to brightness by \\"polishing\\" or \\"refinishing\\" with Cimolian earth. Others were less colour-fast, and would have required separate laundering. In the best-equipped establishments, garments were further smoothed under pressure, using screw-presses.Flohr, pp. 57‚Äì65, 144‚Äì148 Laundering and fulling were punishingly harsh to fabrics, but purity and cleanliness of clothing was in itself a mark of status. The high-quality woolen togas of the senatorial class were intensively laundered to an exceptional, snowy white, using the best and most expensive ingredients. Lower ranking citizens used togas of duller wool, more cheaply laundered; for reasons that remain unclear, the clothing of different status groups might have been laundered separately.Flower, pp. 168‚Äì169 Front of house, fullonicae were run by enterprising citizens of lower social class, or by freedmen and freedwomen; behind the scenes, their enterprise might be supported discreetly by a rich or elite patron, in return for a share of the profits. The Roman elite seem to have despised the fulling and laundering professions as ignoble; though perhaps no more than they despised all manual trades. The fullers themselves evidently thought theirs a respectable and highly profitable profession, worth celebration and illustration in murals and memorials.Flohr, pp. 2, 31‚Äì34 Pompeian mural paintings of launderers and fullers at work show garments in a rainbow variety of colours, but not white; fullers seem to have been particularly valued for their ability to launder dyed garments without loss of colour, sheen or \\"brightness\\", rather than merely whitening, or bleaching.Flohr, p. 61 New cloth and clothing may also have been laundered; the process would have partially felted and strengthened woolen fabrics.Flohr, pp. 31‚Äì34 See also *Clothing in the ancient world *Biblical clothing *Byzantine dress *Clothing in ancient Greece *Ancient Roman military clothing *Roman jewelry ReferencesCited sources  * Category:History of clothing ","title":"Clothing in ancient Rome"},{"id":"10117786","text":"is a Japanese light novel series by Katsumi Nishino, with illustrations by Koin. The first novel was released by Media Factory on October 31, 2005 under its MF Bunko J imprint, and it published 15 volumes until December 24, 2010. A manga adaptation illustrated by Rin Yamaki was serialized in Media Factory's seinen manga magazine Monthly Comic Alive between the August 2006 and August 2010 issues. A drama CD was produced by Media Factory and released on March 28, 2007. A twelve-episode anime adaptation produced by Xebec aired in Japan between April and June 2008 on AT-X, and has been licensed by Media Blasters for release in North America. A two-part OVA sequel aired on AT-X in October 2009. A visual novel named Kanokon Esuii developed by 5pb. was released for the PlayStation 2 on July 31, 2008. Plot Kanokon's story revolves around Kouta Oyamada, an extremely innocent young first-year high school student who moves from the country to the city and thus transfers to Kunp≈ç High School. On his first day at his new school, he meets a beautiful second-year female student named Chizuru Minamoto. Chizuru asks him to meet her alone in the music room. When he arrives, she tells him that she is in love with him and accidentally reveals to him that she is in fact a fox spirit. Chizuru constantly and openly flirts with Kouta, even in front of others, embarrassing him greatly. Soon after the story begins, a wolf spirit named Nozomu Ezomori transfers into Kouta's school and class. From day one, she is all over Kouta, serving to embarrass him more and causing Chizuru to become annoyed at her new competition for Kouta's affection. Characters=Main characters ; : :Kouta is the protagonist of the story. He used to live with his grandfather before moving from the country to the city for his first year of high school, and on his first day of school discovers that Chizuru Minamoto a second-year girl is actually a kitsune. To complicate matters, she falls in love with and vigorously pursues him committing \\"disgraceful acts\\" with him in public. Because of this, Kouta has had the nickname placed upon him by other students in the school. He is initially reluctant to engage in the \\"intimate\\" acts Chizuru desires, but does so later on in the series citing her inspiration. Kouta's true bond with Chizuru is shown when they fuse into a powerful being that gives Kouta black fox ears with tails. According to Chizuru's brother Tayura, this possession can only happen if a human and a y≈çkai share a deep emotional bond with each other. ; : :Chizuru is second-year female student at Kouta's school. On the outside she appears to be a well endowed teenage girl, but she is in fact a powerful kitsune. When she changes form, her black hair turns blonde, and she gains fox ears and a tail. While it is implied by her brother Tayura that she is 400 years old, it is later revealed that her age may be in the thousands. She has no recollection of her past from before she met her foster mother Tamamo, but over time remembers some things she had forgotten about herself. From the start of the series she has fallen in love with Kouta, and is constantly hanging around him. She very much wants to enter into a \\"relationship of sin\\" with him and is very forthright in her almost constant sexual suggestions and actions. ; : :Nozomu is a first-year female transfer student at Kouta's school. She has short light ash blonde hair and is in fact a 200-year-old wolf spirit who lives by herself in an expensive but empty penthouse apartment, where she always sleeps naked on the floor. She has an older brother named Saku who took her in, but after Saku attacks Kouta she decides to go against her brother by following her own path. Despite her seemingly detached and emotionless manner, she falls in love with Kouta at first sight and is thus Chizuru's rival for Kouta's affections. She frequently insults Chizuru by calling her a \\"Horny Beast\\", saying that Chizuru \\"smells obscene\\" or that her breasts are flabby. Supporting characters ; : :Tayura is Chizuru's younger brother and Kouta's classmate. Like his sister, he is also a fox spirit but was adopted into her family. He frequently teases Chizuru about her age which results in her getting visibly annoyed. Initially Tayura was jealous of the relationship between his sister and Kouta prompting Chizuru to say that he is suffering from a sister complex. He ends up falling in love with Akane but whenever he tries to get closer to her, he is given the cold shoulder. He has stated that he is okay with her coldness, and the two gradually warm up. ; : :Akane is the bespectacled class representative of Kouta's class. Due to her position as class representative she has a high sense of regulations, and therefore disagrees with how ardently Chizuru pursues Kouta while at school. She is on good terms with Kouta, and worries about his relationship with Chizuru citing her as a bad example. ; and : :Ren and Ai are twin sisters who are first-year students at Kouta's school. The girls are nearly identical except for their slightly different hair styles. They are spirit hunters who live at a poor temple and are frequently seen doing things that homeless people would do; they make stew out of trash and roadside weeds or eat discarded bread crusts. They use chains when attacking and are also seen in the anime ineffectively using explosives. ; : :Omi is a second year student at Kouta's school who is in fact a sickle weasel with the power to control the wind. Omi was once the bitter enemy of the Minamoto siblings. He hates the friendship between Kouta and his friends and does not speak much. In the anime, he hurts Kouta, who took a blow meant for Chizuru. Since he is not permitted to harm humans, this act has serious consequences for him. He likes Mio. ; : :Mio is a second year student with a shy nature who hangs around with Omi. Due to her short stature, she is often mistaken for a grade school student and has even received multiple confessions from grade school students. She is in fact a half frog spirit and can heal quickly. While she did not have a name originally, Omi named her from a combination of his own given name and his home town's name. She likes Omi but becomes incredibly embarrassed when anyone refers to her relationship with him. ; : :Ryusei is a third-year student who has a distinct cross-wound over his left eye and was the leader of the school delinquents before Omi took over. He is a bear spirit. In the fourth volume, he graduates from high school, but soon changes his name to and restarts high school as a first-year student. ; : :Yuuki's is best friends with Kiriko, and the two are classmates of Kouta whom she refers to as the \\"Letch King\\". Unlike her friend she is shown to have a more wild side. She is also friends with Akane whom she teases for having a dirty mind. Yuuki is on the student body often reflecting their stance on things. ; : :Kiriko is best friends with Yuuki whom she refers to as \\"Yooks\\". Kiriko comes from a well off family, and has expensive gadgets which she uses a lot. She dislikes Kouta for being too perverted, and thinks all men in general are \\"beasts\\". Kiriko gets top marks in school even though she does not study. Kudzu Leaf ; : :Iku is a social studies teacher and is Kouta's homeroom teacher. She is possessed by a powerful y≈çkai named who is head of the Sahara family, and leader of Kudzu Leaf. Okata is in charge of the school Kouta attends, and oversees the spirits at school. Okata's powers in both the manga and anime adaptations is shown to be the manipulation of sand. She is shown to be able to conceal people by using it as well as the ability to set up magical barriers. In the anime adaptation, it is shown that she can also put the students to sleep in the school when dangerous situations come along. The true form Okata who possesses Iku is that of an old woman who has survived for thousands of years. ; : :Minori is the main antagonist of the story and refers to herself as Kouta's younger sister. Her servant is a y≈çkai named . As her name indicated, she is a nue, but also has a pair of raven wings for flight. ; : :Saku is Nozomu's older brother. Like his sister, he is a wolf spirit. He usually drives a motorcycle around town and he is in love with Chizuru. ; : :Takao is the gym teacher at Kouta's school who has a scary face. Like Iku, he too oversees the spirits at school. He is very wise and gets along with Yukihana. Y≈çkai and gods ; : :Tamamo is Tamamo-no-Mae, a powerful nine- tailed fox spirit and Chizuru's mother, though they are not blood related. She is the manager of which is a hot spring hotel deep in the snowy mountains. When business is slow, she manages a beachside restaurant named Tama no Ya (Tama's shop). Yukihana helps her run the hotel, and the shop. She gets along well with Kouta, though she sometimes meddles in his relationship with Chizuru. She fell in love with Yasunari Abe, the hero from the children's book \\"The Legend of the Nine-tailed Fox\\". Rather than killing her as the story implies, he takes her for his bride. As such, she encourages Kouta's relationship with her daughter even though he is a human. She also knows about Yamata no Orochi, the dragon that was sleeping inside of Chizuru. ; / : :Yukihana is a yuki-onna and a ninja who works under Tamamo at the Tama no Yu hot springs resort, and at her beachside restaurant Tama no Ya. She later becomes a teacher for the handicapped at Kouta's school. While working as a teacher, she goes by the alias Hanadai Yukino. If anyone calls her using the name Yukihana, she says that she is not that person. She can manipulate snow and wind to create blizzards. The name Yukihana means \\"snowflake\\", Yuki being the Japanese word for snow. ; :In the manga series, Yamata is the eight headed dragon which is sealed inside of Chizuru as she is the reincarnation of Kushinadahime. She acknowledges to Kouta that she had forgotten this part about herself knowing that she was not an average fox y≈çkai. Tamamo is able to temporary seal the dragons until Chizuru masters their power which she able to do with Kouta's help. ; :Kai is the son of the sea god Toyotama-hiko. He is trying to find a sea god school that a traveler told him about, and he wants to attend it so that he can win his father's love and respect. Kai also rescued a white Hare of Inaba named Shizuka, ever since then she has been devoted to him. ; :Kodama is a small forest spirit that lives in an old tree by the old school building. The old school is built next to the current school Kouta attends so as a result she gets visited by other Y≈çkai. Kodama is always willing to give advice, and has the ability to tell fortunes. She also has the ability to possess others. Media=Light novels Kanokon began as a series of light novels written by Katsumi Nishino and illustrated by Koin. The series started under the title when the first novel was submitted to Media Factory's annual literary contest MF Bunko J Light Novel Rookie of the Year Award held in 2005. The novel placed as a \\"good piece of work\\" with two other titles, which was more or less third place. The first novel was published on October 25, 2005, and the fifteenth volume was published on December 24, 2010 under Media Factory's MF Bunko J label. The series is currently on an indefinite hiatus, with no word from the authors as to when the series will be resumed. The novels were licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment when they debuted their light novel imprint, but has since been dissolved. Manga A manga adaptation was serialized in Media Factory's seinen manga magazine Monthly Comic Alive between the August 2006 and August 2010 issues. The manga takes its story from the light novels that preceded it, and is illustrated by Rin Yamaki. Nine tank≈çbon volumes were released in Japan between January 31, 2007 and August 23, 2010. The manga is licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment, who will release the series in four omnibus volumes. Anime A twelve-episode anime adaptation produced by Xebec aired in Japan between April 5 and June 21, 2008 on AT-X. Six DVD volumes were released by Media Factory between June 25 and November 21, 2008, There are also six specials spread out over three DVDs. A box set was later released on January 22, 2010.

The characters have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime and manga. Kouta's character was criticized by THEM anime reviews for the artwork in the anime adaptation. His facial appearance was described as being featureless, and unlike the manga too young looking. Theron Martin from Anime News Network said that Kouta's youthful appearance in the anime makes Chizuru's advances appear like borderline shotacon. Chizuru's character was ranked #10 in a list of top 10 sexiest female anime/manga characters for her affection towards Kouta in public. Like Kouta however, her appearance was criticized by THEM Anime reviews for lacking facial features in the anime adaptation. Travis Bruno from Capsule Computers gave Chizuru's manga appearance a good review, saying that she is designed well with \\"clear cut differences\\" between her human and fox forms. Nozomu's appearance in the anime was mentioned in a review by Chris Beveridge from the Fandom Post. He stated that the addition of Nozomu without a doubt adds more competition to things, going on to say that unlike Chizuru Nozomu competes with Chizuru on more of a quiet side which adds to her appeal.

Use of pesticides has improved agricultural productivity, but there are also concerns about safety, health and the environment. Cornell Entomology & Ecology and Evolutionary Biology -- David Pimental This book is the result of research by leading scientists and policy experts into the non-technical and social issues of pesticides. In examining the social policies related to pesticides use, they consider the costs as well as the benefits. The book says that Intensive farming cannot completely do without synthetic chemicals, but that it is technologically possible to reduce the amount of pesticides used in the United States by 35-50 per cent without reducing crop yields. The researchers show that to regain public trust, those who regulate and use pesticides must examine fair ethical questions and take appropriate action to protect public welfare, health, and the environment. Anyone concerned with reducing our reliance on chemical pesticides and how human activities can remain both productive and environmentally sound will find this volume a stimulating contribution to a troubling debate.Foster, John and Mark Walton. \\"Book Review: The Pesticide Question\\", Australian Journal of Environmental Management, March 1995, pp. 55-56. The Pesticide Question builds on the 1962 best seller book Silent Spring by Rachel Carson. Carson did not reject the use of pesticides, but argued that their use was often indiscriminate and resulted in harm to people and the environment. She also highlighted the problem of pests becoming resistant to pesticides. Carson's work is referred to many times in The Pesticide Question, which critically explores many non-technical issues associated with pesticide use, mainly in the United States. The book has 40 contributors, mainly academics from a wide range of disciplines. The Pesticide Question is divided into five main parts: * social and environmental effects of pesticides; * methods and effects of reducing pesticide use; * government policy and pesticide use; * history, public attitudes, and ethics in regard to pesticide use; and * the benefits and risks of pesticides.

Music education is a field of study that focuses on the teaching and application of music in the classroom. As this addition to the curriculum progresses, the effects and implications to this course of study are being widely debated, especially the factors pertaining to. Researchers are able to follow its progression from its earliest known application within the field of academics.  History  The earliest systematic music education in the country was centered on the training of singers for Protestant church services, to lead the congregation in psalm- singing. In the 18th century, the first singing schools in the country were founded, and a number of legendary traveling singing masters traveled New England, teaching in barns, schoolhouses and other informal locations; these masters included Francis Hopkinson and William Billings. By the end of the century, more formal singing schools in cities like Savannah, Philadelphia and Boston became social singing societies. Public education in the United States first offered music as part of the curriculum in Boston in the 1830s, and it spread through the help of singing teacher Lowell Mason, after he successfully advocated it to the Boston School Committee in 1838. The committee ultimately decided to include music as a curricular subject because it was of a moral, physical, and intellectual nature. Music was considered moral because it played such a part in religion, as well as the fact that it had been documented to produce \\"happiness, contentment, cheerfulness, and tranquility.\\" It was of a physical nature because singing was exercise for the lungs. The committee justified music's intellectual nature by stating that it had been studied as a part of the quadrivium in the Middle Ages, and that it \\"contributes to memory, comparison, attention, and intellectual faculties.\\" Another advocate of music in public education was Swiss educational reformer Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. Pestalozzi believed that nature was the ultimate and original source of knowledge, therefore his educational theories placed a high value on sensory, kinesthetic, and active learning. He felt students should start with simple concepts in all subjects and move later to more complex ideas. Pestalozzi's method was one of the earliest methods that could be considered \\"student-centered learning\\" and his ideas of discipline and a student-teacher rapport based on love and trust were markedly different from the common practice of corporal punishment at the time. The first music educator to use Pestalozzian ideas in teaching music was Hans Negeli, a colleague of Pestalozzi in Switzerland. His Pestalozzian approach to music was brought to the United States, translated, and popularized by William Channing Woodbridge, Elam Ives, and Lowell Mason. This approach prized active and sensory learning, taught sounds before signs, separated music into melody, rhythm, and expression, and also moved from the simple to complex within the context of each element. Many of these ideas are found in later established music teaching methods, such as Orff-Schulwerk, Kod√°ly, and, Dalcroze- Eurthymics. Music education, primarily vocal, remained most common in women's schools, though many private academies also existed, offering boys and girls instruction in orchestral instruments like the violin, viola, cello and piano. In the mid-19th century, educator Luther Whiting Mason established music education in the schools of Cincinnati, and become a prominent author of textbooks. His National Music Course, first published in 1870, was a widely adopted standard part of many American curricula. Music education continued to expand across the country, and gained in respect as an essential part of educational development. There was a music section in the National Education Association by the 1890s.  The scientific method and how it affected music  After the Civil War, pragmatism and the scientific aspects of sequential skill building, accurate evaluations, examinations, systematic teaching methods, and scientific methods were popular in education. Music educators' responses showed that music could be studied scientifically through the use of different methodologies, systematic textbooks and graded music series, and instructional material for teachers. The scientific and more pragmatic goals of education in the nineteenth century had a profound effect on the development of music education in the schools.  Two methodologies: rote vs. note  Lowell Mason Luther Whiting Mason Two main methodologies used to teach music were the \\"rote\\" method and the \\"note\\" method. The rote method followed many Pestalozzian ideologies. Songs were taught first and musical ideas were presented later, one at time, carefully and systematically. Singing by rote was the basis for this methodology. Lowell Mason authored what is believed to be the first music series using the rote method. Lowell Mason's The Song Garden from 1864 set the stage for other rote methodologies of the late nineteenth century. Luther Whiting Mason was a prominent rote method name presented in the textbook. Luther Mason was employed in Cincinnati schools but later moved to Boston to be the \\"superintendent of music in the primary schools\\". Luther Mason wrote school textbooks using rote methodology. The National Music Course, published by Ginn in 1870, had seven books presented in a sequential approach of using rote songs to teach music reading. (p. 196) Luther Mason included very detailed lesson plans for the classroom teacher, since at the time music was taught by the classroom teacher but overseen by a music specialist. The series was designed for fifteen minutes of music instruction each day given by the classroom teacher and overseen by a music educator once per week. The book series was so popular Luther Mason was invited to apply his methods in Japan and Germany. The rote method was less favored than the \\"note\\" method later in the nineteenth century. However, the debate continues today. An example of the note method is Joseph Bird's 1861 Vocal Music Reader and Benjamin Jepson's three book series using \\"note\\" methodology. The Elementary Music Reader was published in 1871 by the Barnes Company, one year after Luther Mason's The National Music Course. Benjamin Jepson was a military man turned music teacher in New Haven after an injury in the war. His music textbooks had exercises and songs presented systematically for the goal of music reading and sight-singing. Jepson later published two revisions of his series under the names The Standard Music Reader in 1888, and in 1904 The New Standard Music Reader. Following in Jepson's footsteps of note methodology were Hosea Edson Holt and John Wheeler Tufts, who wrote The Normal Music Course published in 1883 (twelve years after Jepson's The Elementary Music Reader). Click here to read the Normal Music Course. This series had five books all geared toward sight-singing and reading music. A few other note methodology textbook were presented to show the seriousness of music reading as a scientific and pragmatic study. These other note methodology books included: The Graded School Singer by Blackman and Whittemore-1873, and the Cincinnati Schools' The Young Singer-1860, The Young Singer's Manual-1866, and the Cincinnati Music Reader-1893. The culmination of the scientific method and note methodology advances was presented in Thomas Tapper's and Frederick Ripley's The National Music Course published in 1895. The book focused on a no-nonsense systematic approach to music literacy to develop beauty in singing. It emphasized the systematic and pragmatic delivery of materials. Philip C. Hayden Music Education in the United States took a big turn with the creation of the Music Supervisors National Conference. The first meeting of the Music Supervisors Conference was held on April 10‚Äì12, 1907 in Keokuk, Iowa, at Westminster Presbyterian Church. A music educator by the name of Philip C. Hayden made the first meeting possible by sending invitations and announcing the meeting in the Music School Monthly of which Hayden was the founder and editor of the publication. The gathering was primarily meant for educators to come observe new teaching techniques in rhythm and observe Hayden's music students. During the three-day convention, music demonstrations took place provided by Hayden and his students. Informal discussions on current topics in music education would also take place during the convention. Future conventions and clinics would be based on this model. Throughout the convention, many educators discussed the importance of having a more permanent organization dedicated to music supervisors and teaching techniques. On the last day of the convention, a forum of sixty-nine music supervisors voted to have another convention and became charter members of an organization that would remain nameless. The Music Supervisors National Conference was officially established during the third meeting of the organization in Cincinnati in 1910 with the adoption of the constitution and bylaws. As the role of the music supervisor changed into more of an administrative position, the conference began to focus primarily on the teaching methods provided in the classroom. At the 1934 Chicago meeting, members decided to change the name to Music Educators National Conference. Since the inception of Music Supervisors National Conference, the organization has worked diligently in making sure that every student has access to music instruction in the public school system provided by a qualified music teacher. Vocal instruction dominated public schooling at all levels. Instrumental education was handled largely through private enterprise, until the early 20th century. Inspired by the band music of Frederick Innes, John Philip Sousa and others, many schools offered orchestral instrument bands. This accelerated following World War I, when many soldiers returned with knowledge and interest in the band music they learned as soldiers. The first formal school for music educators was founded in 1884, in Potsdam, New York, by Julia Ettie Crane, but Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio in the 1920s became the first school to offer a four-year degree in music education.  Concert and marching bands = All-female high school, military, and performance bands  Bands during the mid to late nineteenth century were an integral part of every community. These bands would march in parades, provide free concerts, supported soldiers, and played for those in hospitals. During the golden age of bands which occurred from 1865 to 1917, there were approximately over 10,000 brass bands in existence across the country. The band membership did consist of males, but past photographs indicate that there were also all women bands. The female bands continued their popularity into the twentieth century and influenced the evolution of the high school band from totally male to the integration of female into the programs. High schools often housed the standard male band, but also often included a female band. There were also female bands created to support industry. With the beginning of WW II female bands expanded into women's military bands. These bands were created to entertain female troops, sell war bonds, and perform at concerts, graduations, dances, parades, and hospitals (2008). The WAC (Woman's Army Corp) bands were used to entertain injured soldiers returning from the war. One Ohio music educator, Joan A. Lamb, provided great contributions to world of military bands. Lamb was a public music teacher until enrolling in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps later known as WAC. In her basic training, she was asked to become a candidate for officer, but she insisted she had joined to play in the WAC band. She was even sent to a psychiatrist because of her persistence in the effort to become a member of the band. Finally, she located the WAC band director, auditioned for him with her oboe, and was immediately reassigned to the band. Lamb held several music positions within the band which was a first for women. She graduated from Army Music School, directed the 400th WAC Band, started an African American WAC Band, and performed in the Armed Forces Radio Orchestra. After her service in the WACS, she returned to her life as a music teacher, educator, and administrator in Los Angeles public schools where she served for 30 years. African-American women also wanted to serve in the WAC Band. A 404 WAC Band was created. The WAC branch of the military was the only branch who allowed African American female bands. The Coast Guard also created their version of the female band. The SPAR Band played for the troops and performed many of the same activities as the WAC Band. After the war, the SPAR Band was disbanded and the Coast Guard again became all male. After the war, the female SPAR band members became teachers, performers, and parents. There were some female members of the WAC and SPAR military bands who used the G.I Bill to go to college while others continued performing professionally post war. During the war, women's swing bands also became popular replacing the male counterpart serving in the war effort. These swing bands were highly successful and were well received by the public longing for a diversion from the war effort. The Ingenues was an all-female jazz band popular in the late 1920s through the 1930s. This performing band would often appear in vaudeville and variety theaters. Anna Mae Winburn was an African American band leader of an all-female jazz band called the International Sweethearts of Rhythm. Frances Klein was another famous female instrumentalist of the 30s and 40s who played in Kermit Dart's All-Girl Band, under the direction of Irene Vermillion. The women military bands and postwar all-female bands opened the door to more female participation in instrumental music. Through the efforts of these frontier-like women, perspectives changed as to the female purpose and level of reliability. Suddenly, female bands were found to be as entertaining as male bands. Women found a place and purpose in the entertainment world. Women who were thought to only have the ability to be mothers were leaders in the music world. Women's equality began to emerge during this time in history and music was a primary avenue for the movement. These women of the past created an environment which the women of today now enjoy. This environment is one of fairness and the ability to seek success in all career areas. Women of today attend college and may become professionals in the work force. Women like Joan Lamb conquered what had in the past seemed like a forbidden world.  High school music programs during World War II  Students at Washington High School at class, training for specific contributions to the war effort, Los Angeles, CalifVictory Corps at Montgomery Blair HS  Collegiate band service organizations  The entrance of the United States into World War I (1917‚Äì1918) prompted the Wilson administration to promote a \\"patriotic mind-set.\\" Community singing of patriotic songs such as \\"America\\" and \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" were popular outlets for citizens as a way to promote \\"...strong community efforts of all kinds\\" and also assisted immigrants to learn English. In addition to community singing, concert bands and marching bands were also used to promote patriotism for \\"maintenance of civilian morale.\\" College and university marching bands were also culturally influential during and after World War I, especially in the Midwest of the United States. Following the war, members of these collegiate bands were looking for ways to \\"develop good will, fellowship and understanding...and recognize the value of dedicated leadership.\\" Two leading band service organizations were established to fit that calling, the Kappa Kappa Psi fraternity (ŒöŒöŒ®) and the Tau Beta Sigma sorority (Œ§ŒíŒ£). The University of Detroit Band at Dinan Field in the 1920s. Kappa Kappa Psi was the first of those organizations, established on November 27, 1919 at Oklahoma A & M College. The strong sense of patriotism during World War I was wearing off in the U.S., and the band members of the university wanted to continue to advocate band music. Ten collegiate band members were selected including the band leader William A. Scroggs by the director of the ensemble, Bohumil \\"Boh\\" Makovsky. The fraternity quickly became national with the addition of the University of Washington and Montana State College in 1920. Since 1919, Kappa Kappa Psi members have been advocating, supporting and serving over 200 higher education institutions with around 5,000 active members each year. Famous fraternal brothers include John Philip Sousa, Karl King, and William Revelli. There are currently five distinctive purposes for Kappa Kappa Psi today which include: (1) promoting the existence and welfare of secondary school bands and cultivate a respect for their endeavors, (2) honoring outstanding band members through fraternal membership, (3) stimulating campus leadership and respect through positive conduct, (4) fostering a positive bond among collegiate bands and a high level or performance achievement, and (5) providing a positive social experience to all involved in college bands or other musical organizations. Collegiate bands in the 1920s were the domain of young men. Women were rarely involved, if at all. However, as the progressive movement of the U.S. was developing, bands became less militaristic and were accepting more women in the 1930s. Even with the progressive movement, some higher education bands held out much longer as a men-only ensemble. Michigan State University did not admit women into the Spartan Marching Band until 1972. Tau Beta Sigma sorority was established on March 26, 1946, twenty seven years after Kappa Kappa Psi. The charter institution was Oklahoma State University, renamed from Oklahoma A & M, after the organization decided it would be easier to start in Oklahoma rather than Texas. A major circumstance for creating a band service organization for women was simply due to the fact that more women were now involved with university bands in the United States. Wava Banes along with some other women classmates at Texas Tech University approached their director, D. O. Wiley about forming a \\"group of bandswomen\\" in 1937. The local organization was formalized as Tau Beta Sigma and structured after the Kappa Kappa Psi fraternity. Tau Beta Sigma petitioned Kappa Kappa Psi to become a chapter under their national fraternity in 1943, however a complete constitution re-write and difficulties associated with the U.S. entrance in World War II led Kappa Kappa Psi to suggest that Tau Beta Sigma form their own organization just as they had done in 1919. Due to complications with Texas corporation laws of 1945, A. Frank Martin from Kappa Kappa Psi suggested using a similar women's group at Oklahoma State University (OSU) as the founding chapter for Tau Beta Sigma. One month after OSU's charter was granted, the women traveled back to Texas to install the founding women of Tau Beta Sigma. Kappa Kappa Psi was able to convene in 1947 and officially accepted Tau Beta Sigma as their sister sorority. Both organizations grew in the post-World War II era. Society was still evolving and changing and women's rights became front and center in 1972 with the passage of the Title IX law. This law \\"requires gender equity for boys and girls in every educational program that receives federal funding.\\" Since both groups were federally funded, women were allowed to join Kappa Kappa Psi and men were allowed to join Tau Beta Sigma. Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma are still active today and strive to promote the bands they are associated with as their founders did over a half century ago.  Modern secondary education  Music is generally optional in high school in the United States, and may or may not be required in middle or junior high school. Many music programs offer multiple opportunities for instrumentalists including concert bands, marching bands, jazz bands, and small ensembles. Other musical opportunities in most middle and high schools are choir and theater performance. Some high schools are starting to add music theory and conducting classes. These classes may be offered for dual credit in the future. Music education reform In 2015 a study was released from 2010 showing that according to the U.S. Department of Education, 40 percent of high schools don't require coursework in the arts for graduation.http://www.ed.gov/blog/2012/04/ed-releases-new-report-on-arts- education-in-u-s-public-schools/ More than 8,000 public schools in the US are currently without music programs as of 2010. Across the country, 1.3 million elementary school students don't have access to a music class.U.S. Department of Education Music as a core subject= History  According to the US Department of Education, the core academic subjects studied in schools are currently English, reading or language arts, mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics and government, economics, arts, history, and geography. In order to teach a core subject in the United States, one must be a Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT), meaning they must have a bachelor's degree from a four-year institution, be licensed in the state in which they wish to teach, and be fully competent in their subject area. However, individual competencies vary from state-to-state. Historically, music and fine arts had not been a part of core curriculum in schools in the United States, however, in July 2015, the United States Senate, passed a bipartisan revision naming music and art core subjects in curriculum under the Every Child Achieves Act. The core subjects that were added were \\"technology, engineering, computer science, music, and physical education.\\" This was an action against the No Child Left Behind Act, which many United States Education Advocates felt had narrowed down the subjects incorporated into the core curriculum. The No Child Left Behind Act was initially entitled the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, but then was later renamed No Child Left Behind in 2002. The National Association for Music Education, or NAfME, is an \\"organization of American music educators dedicated to advancing and preserving music education and as part of the core curriculum of schools in the United States.\\" The NAfME is an organization founded in 1907 of more than 60,000 people who advocate for the benefits of music and arts education for students at the local, state, and national levels. NAfME published a press release with the bipartisan senate revision and the impact they believe it will have on the United States Core Curriculum.  Implementation  Music is implemented as an academic subject in schools around the world, in places such as Greece, Germany, Slovenia, Spain,. India, and Africa. This is not a comprehensive, as music is considered a cultural necessity in many countries worldwide. Although the NAfME addresses the plan for implementation for music and arts as core subjects at the national level, the fulfillment of this revision of the Every Child Achieves Act varies from state to state. As of 2014, forty-one states currently have an arts education requirement at all levels, but only seventeen of these states have programs with deliberate assessment policies. Twenty-seven of the fifty United States consider the arts a core subject. Georgia and Arkansas have very specific outlines of music, while Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Michigan, and D.C. have no arts instruction requirements for any level of schooling. The National Coalition for Core Arts Standards (NCCAS), has a series of performance assessments entitled Model Cornerstone Assessments, or MCAs, which have been expended in high schools as a pilot program in recent months. In addition to this, NAfME also has nine National Music Education standards, which include: \\"singing, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music; performing on instruments, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music; improvising melodies, variations, and accompaniments; composing and arranging music within specified guidelines; reading and notating music; listening to, analyzing, and describing music; evaluating music and music performances; understanding relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts; and understanding music in relation to history and culture.\\"  Impacts on childhood development and academic success Many policymakers and initiators for music and the arts as a part of the core curriculum believe that students participating in music and arts programs which hold them to high standards will bring a creative outlook now seemingly required in the workforce. Since music has traditionally been viewed as a subject outside of academia, and music has been incorporated into schools as a secondary subject, or often as an elective, there is limited research on classroom benefits of music as a core subject. Many researchers have explored both the benefits to listening to music passively as well as pursuing music actively, as with learning an instrument. The benefits music in the classroom and its effects on brain development, academic performance, and practical life skills have been observed through research by Jenny Nam Yoon. She concluded that the two hemispheres of the brain are stimulated when music is played and how the corpus callosum, the bridge that connects the two hemispheres is larger in musician's brains. The effects of strictly listening to music have long been explored and has been given the name the \\"Mozart Effect\\", which is known to cause a \\"small increase in spatial-temporal reasoning\\". As seen with the Mozart Effect, listening to music has been proven to affect the brain and mood, as well as spatial temporal reasoning, but does not have any long-term benefits. A 1981 study at Mission Vejo High School proved that music students had a higher GPA than students who did not participate in music (3.59 vs. 2.91). There have been studies done verifying music as an enrichment activity that causes an increase in self-confidence, discipline, and social cohesion, as well as academic benefits. 7 Music most often effects the lower parts of the frontal lobe. Analyzing the interaction between music and the brain helps in understanding how and why music education affects students the way that it does. Music has the ability to engage the entire brain, which is unlike any other method of education. Scripp and Gilbert, who have analyzed these effects, also make note of the fact that musical training helps in the development of the brain physically and cognitively. It is also mentioned that the human brain is predisposed to musical development, meaning that music is rooted in our auditory, motor, and cognitive functions and plays a large role in the way we as individuals perceive the world around us. Scripp and Gilbert use evidence from ultrasound images of fetal tissue to draw the conclusion that there are \\"selective responses\\" to certain songs even before birth. Additionally, musical training seems to affect the brain just as exercise affects the body. For example, someone with musical training will have a more developed sense of auditory processing than someone who is not musically trained. Critiques Although the US Senate has endorsed music as a core subject, many, including Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander, argue music and the arts to be extra-curricular. Many also believe that among Federal budget cuts, music and the arts would be the first to go because they are not part of our foundation of core curriculum in America. The benefits of music as a core subject and its impact on the education system through the arithmetic, language, concentration, and other skills involved still have to be assessed before conclusions can be drawn about the concrete, measurable impacts music and the arts have on children in the United States public school system.  Views on funding music education  The funding of music education has been debated in the United States due to budget cuts to music programs and varying beliefs on learning priorities in public schools. Proponents of increasing federal funds for music education have argued that music provides children with cognitive and emotional benefits, such as improving spatial and temporal brain functions, which may help them succeed in other school subjects. Socially, advocates describe music as something that provokes peace, passion, and reduces stress, which they feel provides multiple benefits to students. Opponents of increasing federal funding believe that music is not important enough to warrant federal financial support, as they view it as a waste of tax dollars. Some assert that music programs distract students from gaining practical skills and takes money away from more useful areas, where funds could be more wisely spent. Others argue that the research showing cognitive or academic benefits stemming from music is unproven and needs to be further investigated before reaching a conclusion.  Modern elementary education  Elementary schools in the United States typically offer music classes several times a week, with classes ranging from thirty to forty-five minutes in length. Beginning in about fourth grade, performance opportunities are often provided in the form of choirs or orchestral (especially wind) bands. There are several developed teaching methods intended for use in elementary schools. The Kod√°ly Method was developed in Hungary by Zolt√°n Kod√°ly. The Orff- Schulwerk Method was developed by Carl Orff, the German composer who wrote Carmina Burana. The Dalcroze-Eurythmics Method was developed in Switzerland by Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, who was teaching at the Geneva Conservatory at the time. All three methods place an emphasis on activity and learning by doing. The Kod√°ly Method is known best for its use of solfege syllables and corresponding hand signals. The Orff-Schulwerk Method is most famous for its use of varying sizes of xylophones and glockenspiels, known as \\"Orff instruments.\\" The Dalcroze-Eurythmics Method's most visible characteristic is its use of movement to music, ideally live music. In a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Education, OECD, it is explained that the time students typically spend in school during primary and lower secondary levels is 7,751 hours‚Äîof which, the schools surveyed for the report spent 11 percent of the time on the arts in elementary schools, and only eight percent of the time on the arts in lower secondary schools. This report also explains that the arts classes combined receive almost the same amount of time as physical education classes do, which is between eight and nine percent for both levels of schooling. (\\"How\\") The United States Department of Education conducted a survey of 1,201 secondary schools during the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, Parsad explains. This survey reported that the majority of secondary teachers teaching the different arts classes were specialists in their field (Parsad). In a secondary investigation, the United States Department of Education concluded that 94 percent of elementary schools offered instruction in music, and 83 percent of schools offered instruction in the visual arts in elementary schools during the same time period. Drama and dance classes were offered to only three and four percent of the elementary schools involved in the study, but more than half of the schools incorporated dance into other subjects (Parsad). Art and music classes were offered to elementary students at least once per week, Parsad explains. The University of Connecticut implements various music programs that include general education as well as more focused studies.  Music Programs at the Collegiate Level  With the success of the implementation of music education across the United States, this method of teaching began to advance into the collegiate level. For example, the University of Connecticut offers intensive programs to prepare students for careers in the field of music. Other courses are also offered for students who are interested in obtaining a general education regarding music and its components yet not looking to pursue a career in music, as is implemented in many colleges and universities. At the University of Connecticut located in Storrs, Connecticut, the university offers a ‚ÄòPopular Music and Diversity in American Society‚Äô class which serves as an introductory course to \\"popular music and diversity in America\\". This particular course focuses on these objectives by observing the musical implications of genres such as jazz, blues, and hip-hop, and how it relates to racial and class issues. Another course entitled \\"Music Fundamentals and Ear Training\\" in which students are able to develop skills such as note reading, pitch symbols, rhythm, and other musical concepts. These courses, amongst many others, enable attendees of the university to gain a general music education. Ning Xu conducted a study amongst university students in which she tested for competency from multiple dimensions including \\"moral quality, humanistic quality, mental health, intelligence development and innovation ability\\". Her conclusion for this study supported the hypothesis that music education plays an important, positive role in regards to the competency of university students.  Introduction of technology  Girl listening to radio in late 1930s Throughout the history of music education, many music educators have adopted and implemented technology in the classroom. Alice Keith and D.C. Boyle were said to be the first music educators in the United States to use the radio for teaching music. Keith wrote Listening in on the Masters, which was a broadcast music appreciation course.Mark, Michael L., and Charles L. Gary. A History of American Music Education. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield Education, 2007. Print. Another advocate who promoted the use of technology was Marguerite V. Hood, who was born on March 14, 1903 in Drayton, North Dakota. Hood graduated high school early, at the age of sixteen. She then attended Jamestown College, in Jamestown, North Dakota where she graduated with degrees in romance languages and music, and minors in history and English.Marguerite V. Hood and Music Education Radio Broadcasts in Rural Montana, Cooper, Shelly. \\"Marguerite V. Hood and Music Education Radio Broadcasts in Rural Montana (1937‚Äì39).\\" Journal of Research in Music Education Vol. 53.No. 4 (2005): 295‚Äì307. JSTOR. Hood's professional career led her to Montana in 1923, where she pursued teaching, writing, and public speaking. In 1930, Hood became Montana's second state music supervisor. During Hood's teaching career, the radio was used as an educational tool. Montana received poor radio reception because of the mountain interference, so Hood created local radio station broadcasts. Hood began the music education radio broadcast project, Montana School of the Air, in 1937. These broadcasts aired weekly on four radio stations. Using the radio for educational broadcasts received positive reviews because it allowed students to be reached all over the United States during the unstable time of the Great Depression. Radios were cost effective and could reach isolated, rural schools. The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) played a major role in music education. NBC would broadcast musical examples for students enrolled in public school. Walter Damrosch directed the radio program, Music Appreciation Hour. In the course of this broadcast, teachers were able to obtain the musical selections in advance along with student notebooks and teacher instruction manuals. Two other popular music broadcast programs were Alice in Orchestralia and the Standard Symphony Hour. These broadcasts were an innovative teaching strategy which promoted and encouraged active listening and music appreciation. Prior to the radio, listening to music was limited to live performances and the skill of the teacher to play music, specifically on the piano.Weidenbach, Vanda. \\"Innovations in Music Education.\\" Primary Educator Vol. 3. No. 1 (1997). Professional Development Collection. Web. 15 Mar. 2011. The impact of the radio in the 1930s can similarly be compared to some of today's technology, such as iPods, compact discs, and computers. Technology has become much more widely available in the classroom since the 1930s. Today, children have access to many musical devices and options that were not available in the 1930s. In essence, technology has been used in music classrooms throughout the United States with the intent to improve the quality of music education for students.  Continued research and development  As the medium of music technology continues to thrive, researchers have found that new developments in Extended Reality (XR) technology (such as augmented and virtual reality) can have direct implications in translating movement into a recorded piece of music. Thomas Deacon, Nick Bryan-Kinns, Patrick G.T. Healey, and Mathieu Barthet of the Queen Mary University of London performed an observational study of collaborative spatial music composition uncovering the practical methods of two experienced music producers to coordinate their understanding of multi- modal and spatial representations of music as part of their workflow. Through their analysis, the team suggested that gesture is used to understand, communicate and form action through a process of shaping sounds in space. This metaphor highlights how aesthetic assessments are collaboratively produced and developed through coordinated spatial activity. The implications establish sensitivity to embodied action in the development of collaborative workspaces for creative, spatial-media production of music.

The Queensland State of Origin and Australian international representative , he played his club football in Brisbane with the Eastern Suburbs Tigers and in Sydney with the Eastern Suburbs Roosters. After playing, Lang became a first-grade coach in Brisbane with Easts, then in Sydney with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Penrith Panthers (with whom he won the 2003 NRL premiership) and South Sydney Rabbitohs. Lang also coached the Australian Super League test team in 1997. Lang's son, Martin Lang, also played for the Sharks, Panthers, Queensland and Australia, and uniquely played his entire first-grade career with his father as coach. Playing career Lang was a with Brisbane club, Easts Tigers from 1969 to 1979. He won three premierships with the club in 1972, 1977 and 1978. Also in 1972 Lang played for Brisbane in the last ever Bulimba Cup final against Toowoomba, winning 55-2. Lang was one of only two Queenslanders selected for the 1973 Australian Kangaroo tour to France. Lang also played a test in 1974 against Great Britain and again in 1980 against New Zealand. In 1975 he was a member of the victorious Australian team which won the Rugby League World Cup. In 1980, Lang accepted an offer from former Kangaroo teammate, Bob Fulton, to move to Sydney to play for Eastern Suburbs. Lang played on the losing side in the 1980 grand final against Canterbury-Bankstown. Although Lang played in nineteen state matches for Queensland, he also played for New South Wales in 1980. The inaugural year of State of Origin contests, only one match of three was played under a state of origin rules and, as a Sydney-based player, Lang was selected to play in the first match, playing a starring role in the win over Queensland. He then returned to Queensland for the third game of the series (and first ever match between the two states played under the origin selection rule), where Queensland defeated New South Wales 20-10\\\\. Coaching career After retiring as a player at the end of his successful 1980 season, Lang returned to Brisbane to coach Brisbane Easts Tigers from 1981-1984 and again from 1990-1993\\\\. He won premierships with the club in 1983 and 1991 and runners-up in 1992 and 1993. In 1994, Lang took over from Arthur Beetson as coach of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. As part of Super League, Lang took the Sharks to the 1997 Super League grand final against the Brisbane Broncos, losing 26-8\\\\. In the same year, Lang coached the Australian Super League team in five international matches against New Zealand (including a win in the inaugural ANZAC Test) and Great Britain. Although these matches are considered tests by the rest of the world's governing bodies, they are not given full test status by Australian Rugby League. Lang was awarded the Dally M Coach of the Year in 1995 and 1999. In 2000 Lang was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. Lang announced his intention to leave the Sharks at the end of the 2001 NRL season before it had even begun, in February, but it wasn't until late September that year that he signed with the Panthers on a three-year contract. Despite losing the first eight games of the 2002 NRL season, Lang was able to develop a side capable of contending for the finals. In his finest coaching achievement, Penrith defeated the Sydney Roosters in the 2003 NRL grand final by 18-6, thereby answering his detractors at Cronulla who argued that the Sharks could never win a premiership under Lang. The Panthers finished fourth after the 2004 NRL season and were eliminated by the Bulldogs one game short of the grand final. Penrith narrowly missed the finals in 2005. In February, 2006, Panther's CEO, Glenn Matthews, announced that Matthew Elliott would take over from Lang as coach of the Panthers at the end of the 2006 season. The Panthers subsequently missed the finals and finished in the tenth position. The South Sydney Rabbitohs, in May 2008, appointed Lang as their football consultant, overseeing the club's structure and providing advice to head coach, Jason Taylor. Following the sacking of Jason Taylor in September 2009, Lang was appointed as the head coach of South Sydney for the 2010 and 2011 seasons. He retired from coaching at the end of the 2011 NRL season.

It is located southeast of George Town, the capital city of the neighbouring state of Penang. As such, the town is also part of Greater Penang, Malaysia's second largest conurbation, with the town's logistical needs being served by Penang's well-developed transportation infrastructure. Bagan Serai is an important collecting and processing location for the paddy plantation of the Kerian scheme. Bagan Serai is also the name of the parliamentary constituency in which the town is located. The word ‚ÄúBagan‚Äù in Malay means a jetty or a place of landing for some business activities, and ‚ÄúSerai‚Äù means lemon grass, a herb often used in Malay food, which used to be mass-produced here. Through the hearsay from old generations, Bagan Serai used to be a very busy pier for trading activities, because of the rivers that flows through this small town straight to the sea, making it a strategic location for trading activities and suitable landing spot for goods. A slightly different version as to how Bagan Serai got its name can be found at the website \\"Glimpses\\".Glimpses - http://sjaznan.wordpress.com/> Demographics and economic activities Most of Malay residents here were migrated from Banjarmasin, Indonesia which in local dialects is called Banjar language. They have a distinct dialect with most of it non intelligible to native Malay language speakers. But as all Malaysians, they do speak standard Malay language. Shops are mostly owned by Chinese-Malaysian descendants. Significant amounts of Indian-Malaysians work as rubber tappers in rubber estates. Banjar-Malay-Malaysians and \\"Malay\\" descendants work in agricultural activity which in Bagan Serai predominantly is paddy fields and palm oil. Bagan Serai is one of 8 sub-districts of Kerian district which included Parit Buntar, Bagan Tiang, Tanjung Piandang, Kuala Kurau, Beriah, Bagan Serai, Gunong Semanggol and Selinsing. It is under the jurisdiction and administration of Majlis Daerah Kerian (Kerian District Committee). Transportation Public transport is managed by a private company called The Red Omnibus. The town has a main bus stand which located at the New Town of Bagan Serai and close to Main Market of Bagan Serai. The bus stand also provides taxi services. Bus to the center of town from peripheral areas runs daily every 30 minutes. Express buses goes from Bagan Serai to various towns and cities including Kuala Lumpur, Georgetown, Kulim, Alor Setar, and Ipoh. There is also a train station in the town. Prior to the Ipoh- Padang Besar Electrified Double Tracking Project, the Bagan Serai railway station was upgraded. Temperatures and climate Yearly, Bagan Serai has relatively colder climate than other parts of Malaysia due to its location near the Straits of Malacca and away from the equator. Taiping is located relatively near and southern to Bagan Serai, which is the wettest place (with frequent rains) in Malaysia. No specific temperature data and precipitation are aired daily in television for Bagan Serai. Thus, usually town people use Ipoh data for Bagan Serai. However, they are not usually true as they may be occasionally correlated with Georgetown, Penang data.

The relationship was aggravated by the Cold War, with Venezuela tending to side with the United States, while Cuba was a loyal ally of the Soviet Union. A destabilizing factor was the alleged Cuban support for the antigovernment guerrilla force that operates in remote rural areas. In 1999 the bilateral relation significantly improved during the Presidency of Hugo Ch√°vez. Ch√°vez formed a major alliance with Cuban president Fidel Castro and significant trade relationship with Cuba since his election in 1999. The warm relationship between the two countries continued to intensify. After decades of close ties in the Caribbean, several governments in the region started to distance from the United States. Hugo Ch√°vez described Castro as his mentor and called Cuba \\"a revolutionary democracy\\". The bilateral relation includes development aid, joint business ventures, large financial transactions, exchange of energy resources and information technology, and cooperation in the fields of intelligence service and military. A characteristic of Cuba-Venezuela ties is that both nations are exchanging assets among each other which are inexpensive for the sending country but of high significance for the receiving country. Early history Narciso Lopez, Venezuelan adventurer who fought for Cuban independence Venezuela and Cuba's ties go back to when Cuba was still under Spanish rule, when among the signers of the Act of Independence of Venezuela in 1811 was Francisco Javier Y√°nez native of Puerto Principe (actual Camag√ºey) . In the celebrated battle of Carabobo (1821) Jos√© Rafael de las Heras from Havana fought fiercly at side of the patriot army. Promoted to colonel by general Sim√≥n Bol√≠var himself, and before whom the Liberator would make the promise not to sheathe his sword until Cuba was free. In 1823 the \\"Conspiracy of Rayos y Soles de Bolivar\\" was led by the Venezuelan Carlos Aponte, who along with a group of Venezuelans and Cubans arrived in Cuba on an expedition that was discovered in Havana and executed its members by Spanish colonial forces. When the Spanish army withdrew in defeat to Cuba after the decisive Battle of Lake Maracaibo (1823), many Venezuelan royalists were exiliated as colonel Narciso Lopez, Marcos Maceo, who would be father of revolutionary Antonio Maceo, Calixto Garcia de Luna, who would be grandfather of Cuban Independence major general Calixto Garcia. They continued to serve the Spanish government in several military and administrative posts in Cuba and Spain. After turned against Spanish rule, they became a partisan of the independist faction in Cuba. In 1848, during an arrest of Cuban revolutionaries, L√≥pez fled to the United States where attempted to liberate the island and make an independent Cuba that would eventually join the United States as a slave state. The modern Flag of Cuba originates from his first expedition landed in C√°rdenas, was designed by Lopez, as well as a local Cuban named Miguel Teurbe Tolon. In 1851 Lopez and many Americans of the second failed expedition were executed in Castle Salvador de La Punta of Havana. During the Ten Years War (1868- 1878), from Venezuela came, among others, Jos√© Miguel Barreto P√©rez, Manuel Mar√≠a Garrido P√°ez, Cristobal Mendoza, Salom√© Hern√°ndez Hern√°ndez, Crist√≥bal Acosta, Jos√© Mar√≠a Aurrecoechea Irigoyen and Amadeo Manuit. They all fought for the Independence of Cuba in several battles standing out for their bravery. Salom√© Hern√°ndez died in Cuba because of illness, while Acosta, Aurrecoechea Irigoyen and Manuit, drowned the insular soil with their blood, helping to lay the foundations of the growing friendship and solidarity between Cuba and Venezuela. In Guaimaro, Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes, president of the Republic in Arms on April 12, 1869, designates the Venezuelan Crist√≥bal Mendoza, Minister encharged of Foreign Relations, a young man among the Camag√ºeyans was the first to take up arms. Son of Crist√≥bal Mendoza, first President of Venezuela and friend of Bolivar who in 1813, after the defeat of the First Republic wrote to him in the following words: \\"Come without delay: come. The country needs it. I will go ahead conquering and you will continue organizing me; Because you are the man of the organization, as I am of the conquest.\\" Crist√≥bal Mendoza reached the rank of colonel and died in front of the Spanish firing squad on December 30, 1870, two days after falling prisoner in Najasa, Camag√ºey. In 1871 the president Antonio Guzman Blanco, supported the so-called \\"Venezuelan Expedition of the Vanguard\\", which landed in the eastern department of Cuba on June 17 commanded by the Cuban Brigadier Rafael de Quesada. In this attempt to liberate Cuba were 200 men, mostly Venezuelans, with 600 weapons, ammunition and 40 mules. In Camag√ºey, they fought the successful combat of Sabanas del Ciego, in which the Spanish forces were very decimated. But it was not an obstacle that the Cuban patriot Jose Marti, implying in Venezuelan politics, was expelled by Guzman Blanco in 1881. Marti must hurriedly leave Caracas, where he planned to live his exile, without being able to say farewell to his friends and return to New York. Descendants of Bolivar and relatives of marechal Antonio Jose de Sucre, they fought in the War of the 95. 20th century In 1902 under president Cipriano Castro, Venezuela and Cuba established diplomatic relations not long after the latter became independent aftermath the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. By 1913, Cuba and Venezuela signed an extradition treaty.Bulletin of the Pan American Union, vol. XXXVI (1913), p. 760 During the years of the Fidel Castro guerilla which fight in the Sierra Maestra to overthrown the dictator Fulgencio Batista were many gestures and actions of Venezuelan solidarity with the 26th of July Movement. In fact, after the fall of dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez on January 23, 1958 a street campaign called \\"The March of Bolivar to the Sierra Maestra\\", $220,000 were collected, as well as a lot of arms and ammunition that were taken by Captain Hector Abdelnour Musa on board of a C-46 airplane, purchased for that purpose, which were delivered to Cuban guerilla. The weapons imported from United States, came from the arsenals of the Venezuelan Army. All this was managed by Ren√© Est√©vez with the knowledge and approval of then-President Wolfgang Larrazabal, supported by his brother Carlos and other officers like Hugo Trejo. In turn, Venezuelan broadcasters had the initiative to retransmit the war parts of the Radio Rebelde through Radio Rumbos and Radio Continent, which allowed to know the advances of the Castro guerillas and the setbacks of the dictator Batista. With the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, on January 1, 1959, a new period was opened in Havana-Caracas bilateral relations. On January 3, 1959, the Minister of State of Cuba requested from the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs the recognition of the new Cuban Government, which emerged after the fall of Batista. On January 5, 1959, the Venezuelan Government recognizes the newly established Cuban government in Havana. On January 23, 1959 Castro visited Venezuela. It was his first trip abroad after the triumphal entry in Havana on January 6, 1959. During five-day in Caracas Castro was celebrated as a continental hero by Venezuelan people. The trip had one main reason: to express appreciation to the Venezuelan people for their valuable moral and material contribution to the cause of Cuba Libre. Castro was honorated with a welcoming ceremony offered by the Congress, and also at the Venezuela Central University, the Municipal Council of Caracas and the multitudinary meeting in the Plaza El Silencio. At the Venezuela Central University, he met a great poet, the Chilean Pablo Neruda, who spoke in a massive act of students and read his Canto a Bolivar. Luis B√°ez summarized what Neruda said: \\"In this painful and victorious hour that the peoples of America live, my poem with changes of place, can be understood directed to Fidel Castro, because in the struggles for freedom the fate of a Man to give confidence to the spirit of greatness in the history of our peoples.\\". Castro also met with President-elect R√≥mulo Betancourt, unsuccessfully requesting a loan and a new deal for Venezuelan oil. 1960s‚Äì1999 R√≥mulo Betancourt's inaugural address in 1959 Relations rapidly deteriorated after president R√≥mulo Betancourt came to power in February, 1959 as Castro sought to bring Venezuela's oil wealth into his own revolution. In the 1960s, Castro supplied combat training and arms to Venezuelan guerillas. In November 1961, President Betancourt broke relations with Cuba following a policy, called the Betancourt Doctrine, of not having ties with governments that had come to power by non-electoral means.Ewell, Judith. Venezuela: A Century of Change, p.145. Stanford University Press (1984), In January 1962, Venezuela voted to expel Cuba from the Organization of American States (OAS) and in July 1964 successfully petitioned to have OAS sanctions imposed on Cuba after the discovery of arms cache on a Venezuelan beach the previous November, allegedly dropped by Cubans for use by the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci√≥n Nacional (FALN) guerrillas seeking to establish a Marxist government. Castro had inspired the guerrillas who threatened Betancourt's government and elections scheduled for 1963.Ewell, Judith. Venezuela and the United States: From Monroe's Hemisphere to Petroleum's Empire, p.216. University of Georgia Press (1996), In 1966, Arnaldo Ochoa with the Venezuelan guerrilla commander Luben Petkoff, took a boat from Cuba to the shores of Falc√≥n, Venezuela, on a secretive expedition. Along with 15 other Cuban troops was sent by Castro to strengthen guerrillas fighting alongside Venezuelan militant Douglas Bravo, they attempted to attack the government of Raul Leoni which ended in a major strategic loss and a large cost of human life. Only one year later, a dozen of Cuban and Venezuelan guerrillas trained by Cuba landed in May 1967 near the Machurucuto beaches and were intercepted by the Venezuelan Army.Weisburd, Arthur Mark. Use of Force: The Practice of States Since World War II, p.186. Penn State Press (1997), Soon after, the Venezuelan government held a press conference denouncing Cuban aggression against Venezuela and showing the two captured Cubans, Manuel Gil Castellanos and Pedro Cabrera Torres. Cuba was denounced by Venezuela to the OAS. Cuba did not recognize the action even when the investigation of the AK47s in possession of the guerrillas were identified as weapons sold by Czechoslovakia to Cuba. The Government of Venezuela broke all relations with Cuba after this incident and then take them back in 1974.TIME, 19 May 1967, Latin America: Castro's Targets Once Betancourt and his similarly-minded successor Ra√∫l Leoni left office, Venezuela increasingly identified with the Third World and guerrilla activity waned, with Castro renouncing his exportation of his revolution, allowing for a tentative rapprochement. Diplomatic relations were restored in 1974 by government of Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez, oil deliveries resumed, and Venezuela advocated Cuba's readmission to the OAS. Tensions occasionally resurfaced, especially over Venezuela's handling of those who attacked Cubana Flight 455 in 1977 and the Cubans who sought refuge in Venezuela's Havana embassy in 1980.Ewell 1996, p.216 In 1992, Castro initially denounced the 1992 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempts performed by Hugo Ch√°vez. However, after Ch√°vez was pardoned in 1994, Castro invited him to Havana seeking more international assistance following the collapse of the Soviet Union which damaged Cuba's economy. 1999‚Äìpresent=Ch√°vez and Castro USS Yorktown, a US Navy ship docked at Cura√ßao in the Netherlands Antilles, in 2002 British journalist and historian Richard Gott pointed that Hugo Ch√°vez and Fidel Castro share several similarities. Castro became a national hero in Cuba after his failed Moncada Barracks attacks on July 26, 1953, and Ch√°vez led the unsuccessful February 1992 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt. Castro spent several years in prison and then led a two-year-long guerrilla war before assuming power in 1959 and Ch√°vez also came to power after spending a period in prison and established his own political movement. In 1999, Ch√°vez visited Havana and stated at the University of Havana (UH), \\"Venezuela is traveling towards the same sea as the Cuban people, a sea of happiness and of real social justice and peace\\". He called Castro \\"brother\\" and said: Hugo Ch√°vez and Raul Castro in 2010 Following the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt, Ch√°vez grew closer to Cuba in order to gain their assistance so he could hold on to power. Ch√°vez could no longer trust his own personnel in his \\"situation room\\" and brought in the G2, Cuban intelligence. One Ch√°vez aide stated that \\"I saw their strategy: seal Ch√°vez off from public, manipulate him, nourish his insecurity, find evidence of assassination plots, of betrayals. Make him paranoid.\\" Venezuela would trade tens of thousands of barrels of oil for military personnel and intelligence from Cuba while Ch√°vez also received assistance with social programs in order to maintain voter loyalty. In 2005, Ch√°vez said that the cooperation between Cuba and Venezuela is an example of what socialism can and should do. While jointly appearing with Castro on a six-hour TV phone-in programme in August 2005, Ch√°vez said he did not see Cuba as a dictatorship; he said \\"It's a revolutionary democracy\\". Ch√°vez said the democracy promoted by George W. Bush is \\"a false democracy of the elite\\" and a \\"democracy of bombs\\". Ch√°vez regards Castro as his mentor. In May 2008, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicol√°s Maduro, leading a delegation in Cuba to attend the 12th meeting of the Cuba-Venezuela Political Consultation Body, met Vice President of Cuba Carlos Lage D√°vila at the Ministers' Council headquarters to discuss the situation in Latin America and other bilateral issues. At the opening of the meeting, Maduro said Cuban Revolution \\"showed us the path of the second, real political, economic, social and cultural independence 50 years ago\\". Describing the relations between the two countries, he said \\"our relation is a profound, longstanding, strategic fraternity by which we have become a single people, a single nation, as dreamed by the liberating fathers\\". Maduro held talks with Ra√∫l Castro also and discussed issues related to bilateral relations. Post-Ch√°vez relations Cuban President Miguel D√≠az-Canel at Maduro's second inauguration on 10 January 2019 Immediately after the death of Hugo Ch√°vez, Castro sought a new benefactor after Venezuela's economy was in ruin and the oil trade between the two countries were beginning to slow. With Cuba needing new support, relations between the United States and Cuba began to be reestablished in 2014 during United States‚ÄìCuban Thaw. In 2019, the opposition-majority National Assembly voted and approved to cut Venezuela's oil supply to Cuba, aiming to save at least US$2,585,000 daily, according to its President Juan Guaid√≥. Economic ties On December 14, 2004, Ch√°vez and Castro signed a joint declaration which said that neoliberalism acts as \\"a mechanism to increase dependence and foreign domination\\". The two leaders described the US-supported Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) as an \\"expression of a hunger to dominate the region\\" and said that the free trade area will result in increase in poverty and subordination in Latin America. According to the joint declaration, economic integration is necessary for the Latin American nations to earn a respected position in the world economy, but this integration will be based on mutual cooperation. On January 25, 2007, Ch√°vez and Cuba's Vice President Carlos Lage signed an agreement to develop a range of production projects which involved nickel, electricity and rice. This deal also included construction of an underwater fiber optics cable to bypass a US embargo which was aimed to be built within 2009. From 2008 to 2011, Hugo Ch√°vez's government in Venezuela gave Cuba $18 billion in loans, investments and grants. During the crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, trade between the two countries slowed. Venezuela's exports to Cuba dropped from $5.1 billion in 2014 to $1.6 billion in 2016, while Cuban exports to Venezuela declined from $2 billion to $642,000 in the same period. Merchandise trade with Venezuela fell to $2.2 billion in 2016, compared with $4.2 billion the year before and $7.3 billion in 2014, the Cuban National Statistics Office reported on its website. Oil In October 2000, Ch√°vez and Castro signed the Convenio Integral de Cooperaci√≥n under which Venezuela will send per day of oil to Cuba and will receive technical support in the fields of education, health care, sports, science and technology. In February 2005, Venezuela increased its discounted oil shipments to Cuba to per day which represents less than 3.5% of Venezuela's total oil production. But for Cuba, is of high value. Much of this oil obtained from Venezuela is subsidized. According to 2005 estimates, Venezuela is providing Cuba nearly to of oil free of cost, for a total \\"gift\\" of $6‚Äì8 billion until 2020. Cuba is reportedly re-exporting 40,000 to of oil because Cuba produces oil domestically and total oil consumption in Cuba is . In 2007, the two countries established a joint venture to revamp the Cienfuegos oil refinery in Cuba. Venezuela and Cuba were set to invest approximately $800m to $1bn in primary stage into the programme. According to this scheme, 51% share of the plant will be held by Cuba and 49% by Petr√≥leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), the Venezuelan state-owned petroleum company. In December 2007, Ch√°vez attended the Petrocaribe summit in Havana along with several prime ministers and presidents from around the Caribbean and Central America. In 2019, the opposition controlled National Assembly voted and approved to cut Venezuela's oil supply to Cuba, saving at least $2,585,000 daily, according to its Speaker Juan Guaid√≥. Health care In return for Venezuelan oil, Cuba is sending approximately 30,000 to 50,000 technical personnel to Venezuela, including physicians, sport coaches, teachers, and arts instructors who offer social services, often in poverty-stricken regions. Under the programme Convenio de Atenci√≥n a Pacientes implemented in 2000, Venezuela send patients and their relatives for medical treatment in Cuba where the Government of Venezuela pays the transportation costs, and Cuba bears all other expenses. In April 2005, the presidents Ch√°vez and Castro signed an agreement to increase the number of healthcare workers in Venezuela in exchange for oil shipments. As part of the agreement, Cuba would help Venezuela train 30,000 \\"comprehensive community doctors\\" to staff Venezuela's \\"Barrio Adentro\\" (Inside the Barrio) public health program which included establishment of 1,000 free medical centers and surgical treatment for approximately 100,000 Venezuelans in Cuba. With Cuban assistance, Barrio Adentro network has four stages, delivering free healthcare from 7,000 local community clinics up to hospital level. The program is measured to have administered over 500 million consultations and saved over 1.4 million lives since its founding. Meanwhile, the oil shipment to Cuba is increased to per day. In 2005 alone, 50,000 Venezuelans went to Cuba for free eye treatment. In conjunction with other government social programs, Barrio Adentro has been an important factor in the improvement of health indicators over the previous decade. This was highlighted in a study by the Council for Social and Economic Research which found that among other indicators, between 2003 ‚Äì 2006 alone infant mortality fell in Venezuela from 18.5 per 1000 births to 14.2 per 1000 births. Research The Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research and Cuban scientists collaborated in a research project for analyzing \\"stress\\" in rice production caused by drought or saline soils. Research findings on this were presented in the 4th International Encounter on Rice held in Havana in 2008. One of the several objectives of this joint scientific project is to understand the effectiveness of the hormones. Military ties Close ties with Cuba are helping Caracas in its goal to transform the military of Venezuela; these began in 2004. As part of an effort to remove US influence from the country, the Army of Venezuela is trying to replace NATO-compliant Belgian rifles with the AK-103. The Military of Cuba has over 40 years experience handling Soviet and Russian military equipment, and in training combatants in guerrilla warfare and in counterinsurgency operations. Views from abroad American journalist and political scientist Michael Radu in his book Dilemmas of Democracy & Dictatorship expressed negative view over this bilateral relations stating \\"most of Ch√°vez' policies are distinctly anti-democratic, often unconstitutional, and usually anti- American and pro-Castro\\". Another American, Frank Gaffney, founder of the Center for Security Policy organization, expressed similar negative view in the book War Footing where he writes, \\"Ch√°vez represents what Castro always wanted to be: the leader of a revolution that extends well beyond his own territory. Castro has helped Ch√°vez learn how to undermine and destabilize liberal democracies throughout the region by using Castro's own tested methods of political warfare. ... Castro has decades of experience; Ch√°vez has money and power. Theirs is a partnership with Ch√°vez in charge\\". The Federal government of the United States maintain the view that both Ch√°vez and Castro are trying to undermine democracy in the Caribbean and portrays Ch√°vez as a security threat. Critics say Ch√°vez is using petroleum sales under preferential terms to increase his political influence in the Caribbean. He has been criticized for making friendly relations with Cuba, which is a long- time opponent of the United States. In January 2005, the United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Cuba \\"outpost of tyranny\\" and Ch√°vez a \\"negative force\\" in Latin America. Ch√°vez was criticized by opponents on the basis that he was trying to establish a Cuban-style authoritarian government. But the United States' view on this issue has been criticized. Irum Abbasi, researcher of The Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad writes, \\"To the US, the real issue has never been human rights but the success of its client regimes in the region, which is substantiated by the fact that it tends to overlook those human rights abuses that are perpetrated by pro-US regimes\\". She stated that the United States has criticized Cuba and Venezuela for human rights abuses, but often tolerated and even supported regimes which violated human rights, but were anti-communist. Historian Jane Franklin in an article titled Who's Afraid Of Venezuela-Cuba Alliance? gave the example that in 1952 the United States supported a coup which installed Fulgencio Batista as dictator of Cuba and writes \\"U.S. overthrows of elected governments are nothing new, as demonstrated in Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, to name a few\\". Franklin pointed that Cuba is well developed in health care and was once the only nation in Latin America to offer universal free health care, and with the help of Cuba, Venezuela has been able to give free health care to many of its citizens; thus the both countries respect health care as a basic human right. Regarding Rice's remark, she stated that the Bush administration and the media have increased their attack against Ch√°vez and Castro. Richard Gott in his book Hugo Ch√°vez and the Bolivarian Revolution described the United States as \\"the chief imperial power in the region and the champion of the neo-liberal philosophy\\" and said that Ch√°vez and Castro have directed their rhetoric against this US policy. British-Pakistani historian, filmmaker and political campaigner Tariq Ali in a letter to The Guardian wrote, \\"The government of the US has no moral authority to elect itself as the judge over human rights in Cuba, where there has not been a single case of disappearance, torture or extra-judicial execution since 1959, and where despite the economic blockade, there are levels of health, education and culture that are internationally recognised\\". Abbasi noted that recent election results in several Latin American countries indicate a drift towards left-wing politics which she analyzes a result of public anger over neoliberalism.

He was the first person to have been awarded 10th degree red belt (j≈´dan) rank in Kodokan judo, although posthumously. He was also one of the Four Guardians of the Kodokan, and a pioneer of judo in the United States. Biography=Early years Yamashita was born in Kanazawa, then the capital of the powerful Kaga Domain. His father was of the samurai class.Tomita, Tsuneo (November 1962). \\"Histoire du Judo,\\" Revue Judo Kodokan, v. 12:5. As a boy, Yamashita trained in the traditional (kory≈´) Japanese martial arts schools of Y≈çshin-ry≈´ and Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ jujutsu.Sol, Kim. \\"Part 8: Kodokan Becomes an Organization.\\" bstkd.com In August 1884, he joined the Kodokan judo dojo of his childhood friend Kano Jigoro as its nineteenth member. He advanced to first degree black belt (shodan) rank in three months, fourth degree (yodan) ranking in two years, and sixth degree (rokudan) in fourteen years. He was prone to discuss the philosophy of judo with Kano, as Yamashita initially believed power should be applied before technique. He was a member of the Kodokan team that competed with Tokyo Metropolitan Police jujutsu teams during the mid-1880s,Abel, Laszlo (December 1984). \\"The Meiji Period Police Bujutsu Competitions: Judo versus Jujutsu,\\" JMAS Newsletter, v. 2:3, pp. 10‚Äì14.Muromoto, Wayne. \\"Judo's Decisive Battle: Great Tournament between Kodokan Judo's Four Heavenly Lords and the Jujutsu Masters.\\" Furyu, v. 3. and during the 1890s, his jobs included teaching judo at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy and Tokyo Imperial University (modern University of Tokyo). His role as a Kodokan competitor was specially notable in the Kodokan-Totsuka rivalry, in 1886. He fought and dominated famed jujutsuka Taro Terushima, although the match went to a draw when Terushima resorted to groundwork. He later rematched him, knocking him out with a hard ippon seoi nage. A notoriously violent man, Yamashita was known for his many street fights. In the most famous instance, he got involved in a brawl with no less than 17 laborers in Tokyo due to a dispute in a restaurant. Despite their vast numeric advantage, added to the fact that some of them wielded knives, Yamashita and a fellow judoka disposed of all the men, purposely breaking the arms of three of them in the process.Svinth, Joseph R. (October 2000) \\"Professor Yamashita Goes to Washington\\". Journal of Combative Sports. Shortly after, Yoshiaki would get into another quarrel with another cadre of laborers, this time him against 15 of them, but it ended up the same way: Yamashita maimed his attackers with chokes and throws, and even killed some of them by breaking their necks. He was arrested, but was easily acquitted after proving the uneven nature of the brawls. However, he was still suspended by the Kodokan for excessive use of violence. When confronted by Kano himself, Yamashita protested and went to the extent of challenging his master to a fight, but Kano convinced to stop his violent ways by making him realize that some day he might be harmed the same way he liked to harm people. Introducing judo to America President Theodore Roosevelt, 1904 In February 1902, Seattle-based railroad executive Samuel Hill decided that his 9-year-old son, James Nathan, should learn judo, which he had apparently seen or heard about while on a business trip to Japan. In Hill's words, the idea was for the boy to learn \\"the ideals of the Samurai class, for that class of men is a noble, high-minded class. They look beyond the modern commercial spirit.\\"Tuhy, John E. (1983) Sam Hill: The Prince of Castle Nowhere. Beaverton, Oregon: Timber Press. p. 71. . Hill spoke to a Japanese American business associate, Masajiro Furuya,Iwamoto, Gary (September 6, 2005), \\"Rise & Fall of an Empire\\", International Examiner. for advice. Furuya referred Hill to Kazuyoshi Shibata, who was a student at Yale University. Shibata told Hill about Yamashita, and on July 21, 1903, Hill wrote a letter to Yamashita, asking him to come to Seattle at Hill's expense.Letter from Sam Hill to Y. Yamashita dated July 21, 1903, in Maryhill Museum of Art collection.

A week later, on October 17, 1903, Yamashita and Kawaguchi gave a judo exhibition at a Seattle theater that Hill had rented for the evening. Attendance was by invitation only, and guests included Sam Hill's mother-in-law, Mary Hill (wife of railroader J.J. Hill), Senator Russell Alger, and assorted Sportswriters.Seattle Post-Intelligencer, October 25, 1903. Afterwards, Hill took the Yamashita party east to Washington, D.C., where Mrs. Hill and young James Nathan were then living. Meanwhile, the favorable publicity surrounding the event caused Japanese Americans living in Seattle to start their own judo club, known as the Seattle Dojo. Soon after arriving in the District of Columbia, Yamashita visited the Japanese Legation, and in March 1904, the Japanese naval attach√©, Commander Takeshita Isamu, took Yamashita to the White House to meet President Theodore Roosevelt.Roosevelt, Theodore (1919).

It was released on May 23, 1997 for Windows PCs, the same day as To Heart by Leaf. The gameplay in D≈çsei follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the sole female main character Manami Minase. The player assumes the role of protagonist Masaki Yamada who is living with Manami shortly after they have graduated from high school. Masaki earns money at a job, and when he returns home will have sex with Manami often; this process of work in the day, and sex at night repeats many times throughout gameplay. D≈çsei was re-released on September 14, 2000, with the title D≈çsei Memorial Selection. The game's original soundtrack was released bundled with Moon soundtrack in August 2000 at Comiket 58. Four of the staff that created the game‚ÄîItaru Hinoue, Shinji Orito, Miracle Mikipon, and Shinory‚Äîlater became four of the founding members of the visual novel brand Key. Gameplay and plot Average dialogue and narrative in D≈çsei depicting the main character Masaki talking to Manami. D≈çsei is a romance social simulation game in which the player assumes the role of Masaki Yamada. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. D≈çsei follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. The story begins on Sunday September 14, 1997 with two main characters shortly after graduating high school who are living together. They are, the protagonist and the heroine who he is living with; both characters' names can be altered to anything the player chooses. There are two parameters related to Masaki and Manami which change depending on decisions the player makes during gameplay. Masaki's parameters are physical and emotional strength, and Manami's parameters are degrees of affection and lewdness. How much money the protagonist has from his job is also a factor in the game; the player starts out with 100,000 yen. There are numerous scenes with sexual CGs depicting Masaki and Manami having sex. Typically, Masaki will come home from work and will have sex with Manami after a short conversation with her. This continuously repeats many times, causing much of the gameplay to occur during sex scenes. Depending on the choices, the protagonist may even become unfaithful to Manami which is when more sex scenes with five different women can be viewed. The player is occasionally given the opportunity to rest, but if Masaki rests too much then he will soon go bankrupt and the game will end. Development and release D≈çsei was Tactics's first game. Planning was headed by YET11, who also did programming, and Don, who wrote the scenario, though this person did not contribute in future Tactics titles. Art direction and character design was headed by Itaru Hinoue, and was the second time she had ever contributed in a visual novel. Hinoue also contributed with the computer graphics along with Miracle Mikipon, Shinory, and Su≈ç Akiyama, and Mikipon also worked on the game's animation sequences. The music in the game was mainly composed by Shinji Orito who had at the time moved to Tactics after working under Leaf for three games. Hinoue, Orito, Mikipon, and Shinory later became four of the founding members of the visual novel company Key founded in 1998. Three others‚ÄîMy≈´, Paste, and Ishisan‚Äîalso helped with the music, but between them only composed one third of the game's soundtrack. D≈çsei was first released in Japan on May 23, 1997 as a CD-ROM playable on a Windows 95 PC. The release date was coincidentally the same day Leaf released their visual novel To Heart. Nexton, the publishing company Tactics is under, re-released an updated version of D≈çsei compatible with Windows 95/98 on September 14, 2000 under the title D≈çsei Memorial Collection. Related media The game's soundtrack was released bundled with the soundtrack for Moon, the game Tactics made after D≈çsei, and was called D≈çsei and Moon Original Soundtracks. The album contains a single CD and was released on August 10, 2000 at Comiket 58 by Exobitant Records. The disc contains 31 tracks; the first 15 pertain to D≈çsei and the latter 16 are from Moon. A collection of trading cards featuring art from D≈çsei and Moon were also released.

He was the second son of Werner Graf von Alvensleben-Neugattersleben (1840-1929) and Anna von Veltheim (1853-1897). His younger brother Bodo Graf von Alvensleben-Neugattersleben was later to become the president of the German Gentlemen‚Äôs Club (Deutscher Herrenklub). He joined the army after studying law, became second lieutenant in Infantry Regiment No. 24 and attended the War Academy in 1904-1905\\\\. He then resigned from military service, fell out with his father who disinherited him, and travelled to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This is where his younger brother, Gustav Konstantin von Alvensleben, was already living, who had worked his way up from a simple workman to become a successful entrepreneur. In 1909 he married Alexandra Gr√§fin von Einsiedel (1888-1947). Three daughters, Alexandra, Armgard and Anna Caroline Harriet were born to this marriage, as well as a son named Werner. From this time on he worked as a businessman in export and financial transactions. In World War I von Alvensleben was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class, later he became an Orderly Officer in the Gallwitz army group, aide-de-camp to Eichhorn, the commander-in-chief of the Ukraine, and finally personal aide-de-camp of the Kaiser with Pavlo Skoropadskyi (1873-1945), supreme commander of Ukraine, in Kiev. In this capacity he championed independence for Ukraine. After the war, von Alvensleben became increasingly involved in politics alongside his professional activities. Although he had been a member of the German Conservative Party before the war, he did not join a political party afterwards, preferring to work in the background above all. Nor did he belong to the gentlemen‚Äôs club of which his younger brother Bodo was the president. In June 1930 the ‚ÄòDeutsche Bund zum Schutz der abendl√§ndischen Kultur‚Äô (German Federation to Protect Occidental Culture) was founded and he became its president. Its aim was to funnel all conservative energies into one comprehensive conservative party, planning to have a thorough reform of the ‚Äòestates‚Äô in the state and the economy. Politically he was a member of the inner circle surrounding the later German Reich defence minister and Reich Chancellor General Kurt von Schleicher, and also had close contact with the supreme army commander, Colonel General Kurt Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord. After Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, von Alvensleben belonged to the conservative opposition. He refused to swear the oath of allegiance to Hitler prescribed by law as he was a captain of the reservists. Prior to the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" (a/k/a R≈ëhm Putsch), a hunting companion of earlier times, Graf von Helldorft , a member of the SA and one of the organizers of the Putsch (who eventually turned against Hitler and was executed after the 20th of July) warned von Alvensleben to spend the coming weekend at his hunting lodge, as he then did, escaping certain assassination; it was thereupon that he was first condemned to death. He had been the go-between for Schleicher to Hitler and had made fun of Hitler for his ambition to be the new Napoleon. At Buchenwald he was tortured, especially for the following incident: A guard asked whether he, A., still placed people in classes. Whereupon Opa A. said, Yes he did. And that there were three classes. The first class consisted of people who had been in prison, the second of those who were in prison, and the third of those who were on their way to prison; and to the third class, my dear fellow, is the one to which you belong. Whereupon the beating commences and I suppose it‚Äôs worth being beaten for such a fine story. His grandson, Michael Roloff, who is supplying some of these details, saw him drive up at my mother's place outside Bremen two weeks after he had been liberated by the Americans, apparently jaunty, as though nothing had happened, in the company of the first engineer of the Graf Hindenburg Zeppelin that had crashed and burnt at Lakehurst in the late 30s, a man named Sauer who had a lot of scar tissue. However, von A. refused to take off his shirt in front of his wife, Alexandra von Einsiedel, or any of his three daughters. In connection with the so-called R√∂hm putsch and the murder of Schleicher on June 30, 1934, Hitler said in a speech to the Reichstag on July 13, 1934, ‚ÄòR√∂hm became connected with General von Schleicher through the mediation of a thoroughly corrupt swindler, a Mr. v A.‚Äô By this he meant Werner von Alvensleben who was sentenced to several months‚Äô imprisonment on June 30, 1934 but was not executed‚Äîas had actually been intended. When he was released he was ordered not to leave Neugattersleben unless he had permission from the Gestapo. Later on he had contact with Carl Friedrich Goerdeler and Ludwig August Theodor Beck via Hammerstein and was‚Äîas Rudolf Pechel writes in his book ‚ÄòDeutscher Widerstand‚Äô (German Resistance)‚Äîpartially privy to the coup plans at the end of 1941. He had already been arrested and charged again for different reasons before July 20, 1944. At the trial before the Volksgerichtshof on February 1, 1945 it was not possible to prove that he had known about the assassination plans, but he was sentenced to two years‚Äô imprisonment for defeatist statements made during a tea party in August 1943, whereby his age and failing health mitigated the punishment. In April 1945 he was freed from Magdeburg prison by American troops. As Neugattersleben had since become part of the Soviet occupied zone, he went to live with his daughter in Bremen-Vegesack where he died on June 30, 1947. Werner von Alvensleben had one son, also named Werner who was responsible for the attempted assassination of the Austrian Heimwehrfuehrer Dr. Richard Steidle in June 1933.

It is a common species, found in southern Africa, which has benefited from the increased nesting opportunities presented by the construction of bridges and dams. Description The white-throated swallow is 14‚Äì17 cm long. It has glossy dark blue upperparts and a bright chestnut crown. A dark blue-black breast band separates the white throat from the greyish white underparts and underwing coverts. The upper wings, underwing flight feathers and forked tail are blackish-blue, but the undertail has white patches near the feather tips. The white throat and blackish breast band are distinctions from similar Hirundo species. The outer feathers are slightly longer in the male than the female. Juveniles are duller than the adult, with shorter outer tail feathers and a browner crown. The call is a mix of warbles and twitters. Distribution and habitat The swallow breeds in southern Africa from Angola and Zambia southwards to the Cape in South Africa. It is mainly migratory, wintering in Angola, Zambia and southern Zaire. This is a bird of open country and grassland, with a preference for highlands and nearby water. It is often found around man-made structures. Behaviour=Feeding It feeds mainly on flying insects, which it pursues with a fast twisting flight like a barn swallow. Breeding The white-throated swallow builds a bowl-shaped mud nest with a soft lining of grass or hair. It is usually near or over water, and is built on a ledge under an overhang on a rock face or on a man-made structure such as a building, dam wall, culvert or bridge. Uninhabited buildings are preferred to houses. The nest may be reused for subsequent broods or in later years. The three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and blue blotches, and are incubated by the female alone for 15‚Äì16 days to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 20‚Äì21 days, but the young birds will return to the nest to roost for a few days after the first flight. The young can swim a short distance to safety if they fall from the nest.

McMillan was usually cast as gruff, hostile and unfriendly characters due to his rough image. However, he was sometimes cast in some lighter comic roles that highlighted his gentler side. Biography=Personal life McMillan was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Margaret and Harry McMillan, a truck driver.Kenneth McMillan Biography (1932-) He attended Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts. Prior to becoming an actor, McMillan was employed at Gimbels Department Store first as a salesman, then as a section manager, and then a floor superintendent managing three floors. At age 30, McMillan decided to pursue an acting career, and took acting lessons from Uta Hagen and Irene Dailey. He was married to Kathryn McDonald (20 June 1969 ‚Äì 8 January 1989) (his death) with whom he had one child, actress Alison McMillan. Career McMillan made his film debut at age 41 with a small role in Sidney Lumet's police drama Serpico. The actor played a borough commander in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, but often was cast as characters such as a cowardly small town sheriff in Tobe Hooper's 1979 TV mini-series Salem's Lot, a similar law enforcement officer in the 1987 Burt Reynolds film Malone, William Hurt's bitter paraplegic father in Eyewitness, a wily safe cracker in The Pope of Greenwich Village, and a racist fire chief in Ragtime who is memorably told off by the New York City police commissioner, James Cagney. In 1985, he played this city's newly appointed police commissioner in the short lived television crime drama Our Family Honor. Kenneth McMillan as Vladimir Harkonnen in Dune (1984) He portrayed the grotesquely obese and gleefully psychotic Baron Vladimir Harkonnen in Dune, the pathetic drunken pop of Aidan Quinn in Reckless and a sleazy high roller gambler in \\"The Ledge,\\" a segment of the horror anthology film Cat's Eye. Yet he did sometimes end up on the right side of the law, playing Robert Duvall's detective partner in True Confessions and a judge who must rule whether Richard Dreyfuss has the right to die in Whose Life Is It Anyway?. McMillan was also adept at comedy, giving performances as a baseball club manager in Blue Skies Again, Meg Ryan's corrupt security guard captain dad in Armed and Dangerous and a dotty senile veterinarian in Three Fugitives. McMillan had a recurring role as Valerie Harper's irate boss Jack Doyle on the TV sitcom Rhoda. Among the TV shows McMillan did guest spots on are Dark Shadows, Ryan's Hope, as a 53rd precinct lieutenant on Kojak, Starsky & Hutch, The Rockford Files, Moonlighting, Lou Grant, Magnum, P.I. and Murder, She Wrote. Outside of his film and TV credits, McMillan also frequently performed on stage at the New York Shakespeare Festival. He acted in the original Broadway productions of Streamers and American Buffalo. He won an Obie for his performance in the Off-Broadway play Weekends Like Other People. McMillan died of liver disease at age 56.

The fortress guarded the Plain of France, the historic invasion route from the north. Anne de Montmorency, a nobleman, senior minister and childhood companion of King Louis I.Le Guide du Patrimoine en France, pg. 333 inherited the fortress in 1515.

The chateau was in the form of a rectangle around a central courtyard, with square pavilions on the corners. It was composed of two three-story residential wings, connected by a one-story entrance wing. A wing of galleries connecting the two residential wings. Both of the residential wings had monumental stairways in their centers to provide access to the suites on the upper floors.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p.10-18 The Constable and his wife, Madeleine of Savoy, resided in the south wing, which contained their private chapel and apartments.

The building was frescoed and furnished during the 1550s, in the style of the School of Fontainebleau.

However, panels of grisaille stained glass in the gallery of the west wing are dated 1542 and 1544, and engravings of √âcouen were included in Jacques Androuet du Cerceau's Les Plus excellents bastiments de France, 1576. The Chateau remained in the Montmorency family until 1632, when it became the property of the Bourbon-Cond√© branch of the royal family. In 1787, shortly before the French Revolution. the original east entrance portal, topped by an equestrian statue of Montmorency, was demolished by the new owner, Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Cond√©. When he emigrated during the Revolution, the Ch√¢teau was confiscated by the French state. In 1806 Napoleon Bonaparte granted the chateau to the Legion d'Honneur and it became a school for the daughters of the chevaliers of the order until 1962.Visitors' Guide to the Museum of the Renaissance Eug√®ne de Beauharnais erected the Fontaine Hortense in the park. However, after the restoration of Louis XVIII of France the estate was returned to Louis Henri, Prince of Cond√©. He and his heir, Henri d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Aumale, made little use of it until 1850, when Louis Napol√©on Bonaparte decided to reestablish the school of the Legion d'Honneur there. In 1862, the ch√¢teau was declared a Monument historique. In 1969, Minister of Culture Andr√© Malraux proposed that the ch√¢teau become the home of the collection of Renaissance art of the Cluny Museum.

The new neoclassical entrance wing was completed in 1807 by the architect Marie-Joseph Peyre, whose best-known work was the Od√©on-Th√©√¢tre de l'Europe in Paris, co-designed with Charles De Wally.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p.10-13 The central courtyard received major additions during the reign of Henry II of France. These included two new peristyles on the interior of the north and south wings, by Jean Bullant, installed to rebalance the facades after the enlargement of the stairway to the royal apartment in the north wing. These new peristyles were early examples of French Renaissance architecture, influenced by the Italian work of Bramante, and decorated with classical orders of columns and niches for statuary. The entrance to the stairway to the King's apartments was originally flanked by two statues by Michelangelo, The Slaves, which were gifts to Montmorency from Henry II. The originals are now in the Louvre Museum. The entrance to the apartments of the King and Queen is decorated with the crescent emblem of Henry II and the rainbow emblem of Catherine de Medicis.Visitor's guide to the National Museum of the Renaissance, pg. 2 Bullant is also credited with designing the central peristyle on the exterior of the North Wing, which covers the loggias of the monumental stairway.

These decorations include painted fireplaces that date to the reign of Henri II, featuring Biblical or historic scenes surrounded by mythical characters and animals, and cascades of fruit and vegetables. Notable examples are the fireplace in the Hall of Arms, illustrating the story of Solomon and Sheba, and the chimney of the Salle des cuirs des H√©roes romaines, which illustrates the Tribute to Caesar. Other walls have frescoes of polychrome designs based on the Constable's coats of arms. These heraldic designs, in color, highlight the more sober grisaille patterns of the stained glass windows, which are also from the reign of Henri II.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p.14-15 Some of the state rooms have sections of their original tile floors, made of polychrome faience tiles by Mass√©ot Abaquesne. Some rooms, particularly the cabinet in the rooms of the King and the library, over the chapel, also have some of their original carved wood panelling, featuring the emblem of Montmorency intertwined with Moorish and arabesque designs.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p.14-15 The Constable's apartments and Chapel The chapel, on the ground floor of the south wing, was stripped of its furnishings during the French Revolution. The original stained glass windows and wood paneling are now in the Chateau of Chantilly. The chapel retains the ceiling of arched rib vaults decorated with the painted coats-of-arms of Montmorency and his wife, Madeleine of Savoy. The chapel features a very early copy of the Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci, painted in Milan between 1506 and 1509 by Marco d'Oggiono, a pupil of DaVinci. It hung in the chapel during the time of Montmorency.Visitor's Guide to the Mus√©e de la Renaissance, pg. 2 Ceiling chapel Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen n01.jpgCeiling of the Chapel, with the coats-of-arms of Montmorency and Madeleine of Savoy √âcouen (95), chapelle, rdc, chapelle 4.jpgChapel altarpiece of gilded carved wood and panel of painted enamel biblical scenes by L√©onard Limosin The Last Supper-copy-Marco-Oggiono-.jpgCopy of Last Supper made by Marco Oggiono, pupil of DaVinci (1506-1509).

The King's bedchamber still has some of the original painted monograms of Henry II, a crescent moon, on the ceiling. The painted fireplace in his bedchamber shows a biblical scene, beneath his coat of arms held by two cherubs. His bedchamber also has two tapestries from the series called David and Bathsheba. √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, √©tage, chambre du Roi, chemin√©e.jpgFireplace in the bedchamber of the King, with a Biblical scene and the coat of arms of Henry II of France Pavement tiles Masseot Abaquesne MNR SN.jpgPolychrome ceramic floor tiles by Mass√©ot Abaquesne in the royal apartments √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, √©tage, chambre du Roi, frise.jpgPainted frieze in the bedroom of the King √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, √©tage, grande salle du Roi 2.jpgFireplace in the Great Hall of the King Collections of the Museum of the Renaissance The museum collections have a history of their own, separate from the ch√¢teau. The first collections were originally acquired by the French state in 1843 from Alexandre Du Sommerard (1779-1842), Counselor and Master of the Cour-des Comptes, who assembled a very large collection of objects from Antiquity until the French Renaissance. After his death, these became the heart of the collection of the new Cluny Museum in Paris. Under the supervision of the museum's new curator, Edmond Du Sommerard, Alexandre's son, many other objects were donated or purchased, until the collection was much too large to display adequately.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p. 8-9 The Cluny Museum re-opened after the German occupation in World War II, and a long debate began on where to put the Renaissance Art. This was not settled until 1969, when the Culture Minister Andr√© Malraux proposed opening a new museum in the Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen. The chateau, which had been stripped of almost all art, was renovated by architects of the Monument historiques,Rebecca Rogers, Les demoiselles de la L√©gion d'honneur: Les maisons d'√©ducation de la L√©gion d'honneur au XIX si√®cle (Paris: Plon) 1992.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p. 8-9 The new collection was chosen from among the objects of the Cluny collection based on chronology and style. The Ecouen museum received Italian Renaissance works created after 1400 and other works after 1500. The new museum also received two important works from the Louvre Museum, The Last Supper by Marco d'Oggiono and the Retable of the Passion by Pierre Raymond. The first galleries of the new museum opened in October 1977. A number of rooms have been furnished with objects suitable for the use of different historical figures from the history of the ch√¢teau. A series of small, focussed exhibitions have been staged at √âcouen over the years since the museum opened completely in 1982.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p. 8-9 Stained glass Most of the original stained glass of the ch√¢teau was removed in the 18th and 19th centuries (some is now in the Ch√¢teau of Chantilly), but the museum displays some remarkable glass from other sites. Many of the windows feature emblems of the King or Constable or other personalities in colored glass, in the middle of windows which are largely clear or in muted colors. Other windows use a full range of rich colors. Among the notable works in the collection is a portrait of King Francis I of France in prayer, by Nicolas Beaurain, made in about 1551-1556. It was commissioned by Henry II of France in 1549 to decorate Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes for the ceremonies of the Order of Saint-Michel, an order he founded. Most of the stained glass windows in the chapel were destroyed during the French Revolution, but this portion survived. It is notable especially for fine detail and shading of the colors, especially in the figure and costume of the King. Another significant work in the collection is a stained-glass depiction of a scene from the life of Saint Paul, showing Saint Paul being chased from the Temple in Jerusalem. It is one of two scenes by Louis Pinaigrier and Nicolas Charnus (first third of the 17th century). It was formerly in Paris, in the Church of Saint-Paul, which was destroyed in 1797, not long after the French Revolution.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p. 65 Ecouen Mus√©e national de la Renaissance7198.JPGWindow with emblem of Montmorency in center Ecouen Mus√©e national de la Renaissance7175.JPGCoat of arms with angels, originally in the windows of the Saint-Chapelle chapel in Vincennes Ecouen Mus√©e national de la Renaissance7177.JPGPosthumous portrait of Francis I of France in prayer by Nicolas Beaurain (1551-1556) Stained glass-Saint-Paul-Ecouen.jpgArrest of Saint Paul in Jerusalem, by Louis Pinaigrier and Nicolas Charnus, (last third of 17th century) Tapestries The collection of tapestries includes ten tapestries from the series David and Bathsheba, made in Brussels in 1520-1525 after designs by Jan Van Roome. Together, they measure seventy-five meters in length. They depict the Biblical story, but the costumes and settings are of the 16th century, and the tapestries give a detailed view of court life at the time. The identity of the original patron is not known, but Henry VIII of England purchased them in 1528. Other notable tapestries include Fructus Belli (Fruits of War), from the workshop of Jehan Baudouin in Brussels, after a design by Giulio Romano. It was commissioned in 1544 by Ferrante Gonzaga, the Duke of Mantua and chief of the armies of the Emperor Charles V of Austria, and depicts soldiers being paid. It shows the growing influence of Italian art on Flemish tapestries. Italian tapestries are also represented, including \\"The life of a man\\" by Benedetto Squilli of Florence, after a painting by Jan Van der Straet. It was originally made for the Medici family for the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, as part of cycle conceived by Georgio Vasari.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p. 36 Bathsheba at the Fountain from David and Bathsheba MNRenaissance E.Cl.1614 n01.jpgBathsheba at the Fountain from the series David and Bathsheba (1520-1525) Fructus Belli MNR Ec.101a n02.jpgDetail of the Fructus Belli (Fruits of War) tapestry, in the Great Hall of the King (1544) √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, √©tage, chambre de Madeleine de Savoie 1.jpgScene from The Life of a Man, workshop of Benedetto Squilli, Florence (about 1564) Paintings The collection of paintings includes work by Toussaint Dubreuil (c. 1561‚Äî22 November 1602) a French Mannerist painter associated (from 1594) with the second School of Fontainebleau (together with the artists Martin Fr√©minet and Ambroise Dubois) and Italianism, a transitional art style. Many of Dubreuil's subjects include mythological scenes and scenes from works of fiction by such writers as the Italian Torquato Tasso, the ancient Greek novelist Heliodorus of Emesa and French poet Pierre de Ronsard. One of the most notable paintings is the Voyage of Ulysses by the Italian Guidoccio Cozzarelli of Sienna, from about 1480. Painted on a wood panel, it was originally attached to a large chest, and was intended to be placed in the bedroom of newlyweds, to remind the bride about the virtue of faithfulness. The painting, based on the Odyssey of Homer, depicts Ulysses' wife, Penelope, faithfully waiting for her husband's return from his twenty years of voyaging.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p. 28 Guidoccio Cozzarelli - le voyage d'Ulysse.jpgThe Voyage of Ulysses, by Guidoccio Cozzarelli (about 1480) 16th-century painters - August from an Book of Hours - WGA15913.jpg'August' - miniature from a Book of Hours (about 1520) La mont√©e du calvaire - dubreuil - ecouen.jpg'The Ascent of Calvary by Toussaint Dubreuil (end of 16th century) No√´l Bellemare et atelier - Le Calvaire avec Fran√ßois Poncher en pri√®re.jpgThe Crucifixion by No√´l Bellemare and workshop (about 1519-26). It depicts the Bishop of Paris, Fran√ßois Poncher, in prayer. Furniture and paneling The museum displays an important collection of carved wood furniture and panels, which illustrate the art of the French wood carving and decoration, as well as the influence of Italian artists working in France, particularly Rosso Fiorentino, responsible for much of the interior decoration of the Palace of Fontainebleau.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p. 18 The works in the collection show the transition of furniture from the medieval period to the Renaissance, through with the addition of an abundance of carved ornaments in classical forms, such as medallions, grotesques and architectural orders, making pieces of furniture such as chests, dressers, tables and chairs into works of sculpture. Engravings of Italian paintings and sculpture often served as models. The collection also includes numerous panels which were preserved from works that were dismantled. The collection presents especially works from the regions of Ile-de-France, Lorraine, Champagne and Burgundy, which were heavily forested and had the workshops of numerous skilled artisans making both religious and civil furniture.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p. 18 √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, √©tage, appt du conn√©table 8.jpgA dressoir from the Ch√¢teau of Joinville (1524), designed to hold formal table settings, with a combination of gothic and Renaissance ornament √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, rdc, chambre de Catherine de Medicis 6.jpgCarved chest in the bedroom of the Queen, with architectural decoration √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, √©tage, appt du conn√©table 2.jpgDressoir in the apartment of the Grand Constable Ecouen Mus√©e national de la Renaissance219.JPGCarved paneling √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, √©tage, appt du conn√©table 3.jpgCarved chair, apartment of the Grand Constable √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, rdc, cusines, 2e pi√®ce, cl√¥ture de ch≈ìur de Gaillon 2.jpgCarved screen from the choir of the chapel of the Ch√¢teau de Gaillon in Normandy Ceramics Detail of Ecouen floor by Mass√©ot Abaquesne The museum has a notable collection of 16th-century French ceramics, mostly designed as luxury dishware, in place of gold or silver. Ceramic tile was also used extensively on floors and walls of ch√¢teaux like √âcouen. At √âcouen, some of the original floors are still in place, including a section in the royal bed chamber and in the salon of the King. These pavements were commissioned from an artist of Rouen, Mass√©ot Abaquesne, in about 1549-1551.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), pp. 72-78 A section of ceramic floor from the Ch√¢teau of Polisy, dated 1545 and demolished after the Revolution, is on display. It was commissioned by the bishop of Auxerre, Fran√ßois de Dinteville, for one of his residences. The design was inspired by the Italian artist, Sebastiano Serlio, and is based on the coat of arms of the family, with illustrations of the family motto, \\"Fortune and Virtue\\". The collection also includes a number of works from the atelier of Bernard Palissy at the site of the Tuileries Palace in Paris. Palissy was famous for his long and unsuccessful effort to imitate Chinese porcelain. His primary success was his series of rustic plates, often depicting fish and sea life. √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, 2e √©tage, salle de c√©ramique fran√ßaise, carreaux de pavement du ch√¢teau 2.jpgSection of original pavement at √âcouen (1549-1551) Deluge masseot abaquesne faience ecouen.jpgFaience mural of Noah and the Deluge, by Masseot Abaquesne √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, 2e √©tage, salle de c√©ramique fran√ßaise, aigui√®re, atelier dit de Saint-Porchaire, avant 1558.jpgAn aigui√®re with a satyr handle as reptile spout, by the workshop of Saint- Porchaire (1545-1558) √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, 2e √©tage, salle de c√©ramique fran√ßaise, plat rustique, Bernard Palissy, vers 1565.jpgRustic plate by Bernard Palissy (about 1565) Enamels The craft of painted enamel is particularly well represented in the museum. The major center of this production was Limoges, where enamel had been produced since the 12th century. A new variation was introduced at the end of the 15th century, and it became particularly popular among royal and noble collectors. It involved copper plates, with a layer of flat enamel on one side and a polychrome painting made with layers of colored enamel on the other side. The most important artists in this style and period included L√©onard Limosin, whose family produced seven enamel painters. He created series of enamels for Francis I and Henry II. His work included portraits of mythological and religious figures, as well as portraits of the major figures of the Court. He also created the enamels of religious scenes on the altar table in the chapel.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), pp. 72-78 Another important French enamel painter from Limoges was Pierre Courteys, who made a series of portraits of mythological figures of unusually large size. The example of Mercury in the museum collection is signed and dated 1559. Its inspiration appears to be a similar series created for the Palace of Fontainebleau by Rosso Fiorentino. Another important artist with work in the collection is Suzanne de Court, also from a family of enamel painters in Limoges. She was one of the few women artists who were permitted by guild rules to sign their work with their full names.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), pp. 76-77 √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, 2e √©tage, salle Arts du feu, Psych√© et l'Amour √† table, √©mail sur cuivre, L√©onard Limosin, 1543.jpgPsyche and Amour at the table, Enamel by L√©onard Limosin (1543) Antoinette de Bourbon Limousin.jpgEnamel portrait of Antoinette de Bourbon, Duchess of Guise, by L√©onard Limosin. √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, √©tage, cabinet du Roi, √©maux de Pierre Courteys (1559), Mercurius.jpgPainted enamel plaque by Pierre Courteys (1559) √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, √©tage, cabinet du Roi, √©maux de Pierre Courteys (1559), Jupiter.jpgJupiter, by Pierre Courteys (1559) Jewelry, goldsmithing and silversmithing The museum displays works of some of the most celebrated goldsmiths and silversmiths of the Renaissance. One notable example is the statuette of Daphne by Wenzel Jamnitzer, a German craftsman from Nuremberg, goldsmith to the Holy Roman Emperors. It was made between 1569 and 1576. It portrays the Greek myth of Apollo and Daphne, from the Metamorphoses of Ovid, which was a popular subject in the Renaissance. The nymph Daphne is transformed into a laurel tree by her father, to protect her from the pursuing Apollo. The statuette is made of gilded silver, with branches made of red coral with touches of silver paint.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p. 18-23 √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, 2e √©tage, cabinet d'orf√®vrerie, nautile mont√© en coupe, argent dor√©, Allemagne, d√©but XVIIe s.jpgA nautilus figure mounted on a cup, made of gilded silver (Germany, beginning of 17th century) √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, 2e √©tage, cabinet d'orf√®vrerie, statuette de Daphn√©, Wenzel Jamnitzer, Nuremberg, vers 1570.jpgStatuette of Daphn√© by Wenzel Jamnitzer (1569-76).

These spurs, made in 1515-1525, were made in the first decade of his reign, and were displayed at his funeral in 1547. Another piece in the collection is a dosseret with a high collar, decorated with images of the Minevra and Mars, the deities of war. It was designed to protect the back of the neck, and could be worn either with a suit of armor or as a collar with formal court dress. The collection in the Hall of Arms includes a ceremonial rondache or buckler, a round ceremonial shield, of iron decorated with silver and gold, made in Italy for Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, showing the enemy soldiers he had conquered submitting to him.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p. 134 Spurs of Francois I Chateau d'Ecouen.jpgCeremonial spurs of Francis I of France (1515-1525) √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, rdc, salle des armes et armures 5.jpgArmored gloves Shield of Charles V 1555 NMR.jpgRondache or buckler of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, Italy, 1555 Backplate gorget MNRenaissance E.Cl.2751.jpgA dosseret or back plate for protecting the back of the neck, with figures of Mars and Minerva (end of 16th century) Scientific instruments, clocks and mechanical devices The museum houses one of the most important European collections of Renaissance scientific instruments, including examples of the astrolabe. clocks, globes, the solar cadran and automatons. One of the most famous items is the mechanical model ship, called the Nef of Charles V, made in about 1590 and attributed to Hans Schlottheim, which originally was in the cabinet of curiosities of the Elector of Saxe in Dresden. It contains a clock which activates seven different mechanisms, sounds the quarter hour, and sets the mechanical figures in motion: Tiny trumpeters and drummers play, the electors of the Holy Roman Empire promenade in a circle around the Emperor on his throne on the stern of the ship, and the tiny cannons fire. The display includes a video that shows all of mechanisms functioning.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p. 118 Other objects in the collection include an astrolabic clock attributed to Jean Naze, a clock maker from Lyon. It indicates the time, the course of the sun, the phases of the moon and the positions of the stars. Other objects include a cone-shaped cup that functions as a sundial and an enigmatic mechanical device with rows of small turning wheels, placed inside what appeared to be a book. It bears the emblems and symbols of Henry II of France, and is thought to have been an early coding device. It was made about 1547-1559.Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), p. 117 √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, 2e √©tage, biblioth√®que du conn√©table, sph√®re c√©leste, anonyme, 1502.jpgCelestial sphere showing constellations (1502) √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, rdc, salle n¬∞ 10, nef dite de Charles Quint 2.jpgMechanical model ship made for Charles V (about 1590) Rooms √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, √©tage, grande salle du Roi 1.jpgGrand hall of the King √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, √©tage, appt du conn√©table 9.jpgThe Appartement du conn√©table, Anne de Montmorency √âcouen (95), ch√¢teau, √©tage, chambre de Madeleine de Savoie 4.jpgRoom of Madeleine of Savoy, his wife NotesBibliography * Mus√©e National de la Renaissance, Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, Guide des collections, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (2017), (in French), * Le Guide du Patrimoine en France: Monuments Historiques, √âditions du Patrimoine, Centre des Monuments Nationaux, Paris (2002), (in French), External links * Official website of the Mus√©e national de la Renaissance * Ch√¢teau d'Ecouen, National Museum of the Renaissance - The official website of France (in English) * Ch√¢teau d‚Äô√âcouen * Ch√¢teau d‚Äô√âcouen and history, lot pictures, in french Ecouen, Chateau d' Category:Art museums and galleries in √éle-de-France Category:Museums in Val-d'Oise Category:Renaissance architecture in France Category:Houses completed in 1550 Category:Decorative arts museums in France Category:World War II museums in France Category:National museums of France Category:1550 establishments in France Category:R√©union des Mus√©es Nationaux ","title":"Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen"},{"id":"10119156","text":"William Henry Mathews (1919‚Äì2003) was a Canadian geologist, volcanologist, engineer, and professor. He is considered a pioneer in the study of subglacial eruptions and volcano-ice interactions in North America. Many of his publications continue to be regarded as classics in their field. Biography Bill Mathews was born in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1919. His mother and a brother died when he was two; his father, Vancouver pioneer Thomas Mathews, died when he was 13. Mathews attended King George Secondary School before entering the University of British Columbia in 1935, earning a Bachelor of Applied Science in geological engineering in 1940, followed by a Master of Applied Science with a major in petrology and a minor in physics in 1941. During college, he served as a student assistant for the Geological Survey of Canada from 1938 to 1941, and was also an instructor in the mountain infantry school of the Alpine Club of Canada, training personnel for the Canadian armed forces. After graduation, he worked as a mining engineer for the British Columbia Department of Mines from 1942 to 1946. He then moved to the University of California, Berkeley, completing his Ph.D. in June 1948 with a dissertation titled Geology of the Mount Garibaldi map-area, southwestern British Columbia. While at Berkeley he met and married his wife, Laura Lu Mathews, served on the Berkeley faculty as an assistant professor from 1948 to 1951, and then returned to Canada to accept an associate professorship in the Department of Geography and Geology at the University of British Columbia. He was promoted to full professor in 1959, served as department chairman from 1964 to 1971, and continued teaching until his retirement to professor emeritus status in 1984. Mathews received the Willet G. Miller Medal for \\"outstanding research in any branch of the earth sciences\\" from the Royal Society of Canada in 1989. After his retirement from teaching duties, he maintained an active research program and began writing a book on the geology of southern British Columbia, working part-time on the project until his death in 2003. The book was published posthumously in 2005 as Roadside Geology of Southern British Columbia. Scientific research Garibaldi Provincial Park was a major focus of Bill Mathews' scientific career. Garibaldi Lake (foreground), The Table (behind lake), and Mount Garibaldi (background) were each among the subjects of his numerous publications. Mathews scientific work embraced a broad spectrum of topics, including volcanoes, glaciers, regional geomorphology, landslides, hydrogeology, stratigraphy, coal geology, and mineral deposits. But his most influential work was in the fields of subglacial eruptions and volcano-ice interactions. He discovered several ideal field laboratories for this research in his home province of British Columbia, including the numerous volcanoes in Garibaldi Provincial Park just north of Vancouver and the remote Tuya Volcanic Field in far northern British Columbia. While still in graduate school at Berkeley in 1947, he published a paper, \\"Tuyas, Flat-Topped Volcanoes in Northern British Columbia\\", in which he coined the term \\"tuya\\" to refer to the distinctive, flat-topped, steep-sided volcanoes formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet. He took the name from Tuya Butte, a near-ideal specimen of the type, and this name has since become standard worldwide among volcanologists in referring to and writing about these volcanic formations. Late in his career, other scientists named a previously unnamed tuya in the Tuya Volcanic Field in honor of him as Mathews Tuya. Mathews published his first article, titled \\"Geology of the Garibaldi Lake area\\", in the Canadian Alpine Journal in 1938 when he was only 19 years old. He would go on to author more than 100 published scientific papers and reports over the next six decades. A large portion of this body of work is devoted to the numerous fascinating volcanic, glacial, and limnological features of Garibaldi Provincial Park, which he examines, analyzes, and interprets in meticulous detail and with far-reaching insight.

He is considered a pioneer of nakige visual novels, and has mainly contributed as a scenario writer, lyricist, and musical composer for the games the company produces. His style was originally inspired by James Herbert Brennan, and is influenced by Haruki Murakami's novel Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World. Maeda's birth name in kanji was written as , though there is no change in pronunciation. Originally from Mie, Japan, he graduated from Mie high school and later went on to graduate from Chukyo University with a major in psychology. Before forming Key, Maeda worked for the company Tactics where he had a hand in the creation of two games for that company, Moon and One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. After forming Key, Maeda has put much work into such titles as Kanon, Air, Clannad, Little Busters!, Angel Beats!, Charlotte, Summer Pockets, and The Day I Became a God. He is also the author of a manga series titled Hibiki's Magic. Early life Jun Maeda started writing at a young age; while attending elementary school, Maeda wrote his first amateur gamebook. Maeda was initially inspired by the Grailquest series of gamebooks by J.H. Brennan, especially the first two books in the series The Castle of Darkness and The Den of Dragons which he found to be especially interesting. Through junior-high school, Maeda worked on the school newspaper and even had some short stories published in the paper. Once attending Mie high school, he started to write lyrics and compose music. It was at this time that he became immersed in the fantasy genre of fiction. While attending Chukyo University, Maeda managed to get some short stories published in Kadokawa Shoten's seinen light novel magazine The Sneaker. Finally, when he was writing his graduation thesis, he started listening to techno music. Career While still attending university, Maeda sought to begin working as a musical composer for video games, and desired to work at big-name companies like Nihon Falcom Corporation, Namco, and Capcom, but he was unsuccessful. He eventually was able to be granted an interview with the video game developer TGL, but was unable to supply correct documentation, and did not get the job. As he was unable to get a job working with music, Maeda decided to change his occupational choice to that of a scenario writer for a video game company. At the time in the mid-1990s, scenario writers for consumer video games were inexperienced, so Maeda decided to shoot for adult games instead. During a period of one month, Maeda wrote a long three-hundred page erotic story intending to sell it to an adult game developer. He first tried with AliceSoft, makers of the popular Rance series, but finally ended up working for the company Scoop. At Scoop in 1997, he contributed as the main scenario writer for the company's first game, Chaos Queen Ry≈çko, however Maeda was not happy with the work environment and promptly filed his resignation with the company shortly after finishing his work on the scenario. Around this time, Jun Maeda was inspired by Hiroyuki Kanno's pioneering 1996 visual novel YU-NO: A Girl Who Chants Love at the Bound of this World. It demonstrated the storytelling potential of the visual novel medium, and influenced Maeda's later works. After leaving Scoop in 1997, Maeda went to work for the newly formed company Tactics under the publisher Nexton. There, he went to work on the scenario and musical composition of Tactics' second game Moon, followed by his work on the scenario for their third game One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e in 1998. After realizing the positive reception received for both titles, Maeda and much of the staff who made both Moon and One, including Itaru Hinoue, Shinji Orito, Naoki Hisaya, and OdiakeS, left Tactics to work under the video game publishing company VisualArt's where they formed the company Key. After forming Key, Maeda worked on the music and scenario for their first title Kanon released in 1999, which proved to be very popular in the adult game market in Japan. Beside Maeda, the majority of Kanon scenario was written by Naoki Hisaya, but he quit Key shortly after Kanon was produced. Following this, Maeda wrote most of the scenario for Key's next title Air, along with again working as the lyricist and one of the composers for the music featured in the game. After a period of four years in 2004, Key released their third and longest game Clannad where Maeda did a vast amount of the writing for the game; in all, Maeda put in around 75% of the work that went into the creation of Clannad. Also in 2004, Maeda began writing his first manga entitled Hibiki's Magic, which was first conceived as a short story he wrote as a student. In 2005, Maeda worked on the scenario and music for Key's fifth game Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life, followed by Key's sixth title Little Busters! released in July 2007 which he also worked on in regards to the scenario and music. Maeda was reported to say in the February 2007 issue of Comptiq that after the completion of Little Busters!, he would not be working on the scenario staff for Key any longer. However, in an interview in the December 2007 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, Maeda said that he would still be working on the music for Key's next game. In 2007, Maeda also composed the ending theme for the game Himawari no Chapel de Kimi to for the company Marron, and he was on the music staff for Ram's game 5 released in July 2008. Maeda worked in collaboration with Na-Ga and ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine to the anime series and mixed media project Angel Beats! as the planner and writer, as well as composing the anime's music. Maeda worked on Key's ninth game Rewrite with the composition of the game's music and as the quality checker. In 2015, Maeda designed and co-wrote the scenario for the Angel Beats! visual novel, as well as composing some of the game's music. Maeda once again collaborated with Na-Ga, Dengeki G's Magazine, P.A. Works, and Aniplex to produce his second anime series Charlotte in 2015, contributing as the planner, writer, and composing the anime's music. In 2016, Maeda revealed that he is suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy. To recover from this condition, he will need a heart transplant. Maeda is credited for the original concept and the composition of the music for Key's visual novel Summer Pockets. Maeda collaborated with Na-Ga, P.A. Works, and Aniplex for a third time to produce the anime series The Day I Became a God in 2020, contributing as the planner and writer. Writing themes As is prevalent in the scenarios Maeda has written for visual novels, there are recurring themes related to the concept of a family and the bonds that hold it together. Most prevalent are the maternal bonds felt between a mother and daughter relationship, as can be seen strongly in Kanon, Air, and Clannad. However, in one of his earliest works, Moon, there was a conflict between the female protagonist and her late mother. On the other hand, Maeda rarely includes detailed descriptions of a paternal relationship in his works, and only in Clannad did he explore such a relationship in any depth. Another recurring theme is that of magical realism, or adding fantastical elements into a story that would appear otherwise to be normal, such as with the concept of the illusionary world in Clannad, or the use of magic in Air and supernatural elements in Charlotte. Similarly, the concept of the switching between a real- life setting and the mystical Eternal World from One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e has been compared to Haruki Murakami's novel Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, which uses a similar dichotomy between reality and fantasy. After the production of Moon with its melancholic storylines, Maeda decided to shoot for what has later become known as a \\"crying game\\", starting with One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. A crying game in this sense is a type of bish≈çjo game which can make the player cry for the characters, and thus give a more profound impact on the players. When working on Kanon with a similar goal, Maeda worked in depressing elements to the two heroines' stories he wrote for: Makoto Sawatari, and Mai Kawasumi. Musical involvement Jun Maeda composes and writes lyrics for songs and background music featured in games he works on. At Tactics, he composed a single piece of music for Moon, but did not contribute to the music in One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. At Key, Maeda has worked on the music for all of Key's titles except for Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet and Rewrite Harvest festa!. He also composed and wrote the lyrics to the ending theme song for the Clannad anime series, and similarly for the opening theme song for the Clannad After Story anime series. Music that Maeda composes for Key titles is published on Key's record label Key Sounds Label. On the label, Maeda produced three singles and one album where he wrote and composed all the songs which include: \\"Natsukage / Nostalgia\\", \\"Birthday Song,Requiem\\", \\"Spica/Hanabi/Moon\\", and Love Song; the songs on the first three were sung by Lia and the fourth was sung by Riya. Maeda wrote and composed the two songs \\"Doll\\", performed separately by Lia and Aoi Tada, and \\"Human\\", performed by Lia; both versions of \\"Doll\\" were used as the main ending theme songs for the second season of the anime series Gunslinger Girl in 2008, while \\"Human\\" was used for the final episode. Maeda's first involvement as a main composer was with the 2008 visual novel 5 by Ram where he composed about twenty background music tracks. Maeda also wrote and composed the opening and ending themes used in 5. Maeda formed his own record label named Flaming June in 2011, and the first release on the label is the single \\"Killer Song\\" by Nagi Yanagi released in December 2011. Flaming June released an original concept album with Yanagi on April 25, 2012 titled Owari no Hoshi no Love Song. Maeda released the concept album Long Long Love Song featuring Anri Kumaki on July 26, 2017.

It was named after its inventor, Swiss engineer Jakob Buchli. The drive is a fully spring-loaded drive, in which each floating axle has an individual motor, that is placed in the spring mounted locomotive frame. The weight of the driving motors is completely disconnected from the driving wheels, which are exposed to movement of the rails. First used in electric locomotives from the 1920s, the Buchli drive made possible the construction of faster and more powerful locomotives that required larger and heavier traction motors. The system minimises the impact on rail tracks due to the reduction in the overall unsprung weight. Although the drive was very successful though the 1930s, it is little used in modern locomotives, having been replaced with smaller, simpler drives that exhibit less imbalance and allow higher speeds. Construction Buchli-Toggle-drive How Buchli drive works In a Buchli drive a driven gear wheel is securely fixed to the locomotive frame. Inside this gear wheel are two levers, coupled to gear segments that mesh with one another. The other end of the levers is coupled via universal joints to tension bars, which are then coupled via more universal joints to the driving rail wheel. Vertical movement of the driving wheel results in the gear segments moving due to the internal mechanism, and the driving wheel can move in a horizontal or vertical direction with respect to the gear wheel, while still transferring the momentum of the gear wheel. A disadvantage of the drive was the large number of moving parts, which demanded frequent lubrication and careful maintenance. As a result the Buchli drive system was mainly used on express train locomotives, as there were no other drive systems that gave the same performance at high speeds. However, at higher speeds the drive components became unbalanced, causing issues at speeds over 140 km per hour. Standard design The Buchli drive was exported to other rail companies as one sided separate traction motor drive, usually with an inside frame. The motor framework with the wheelset bearing is located between the wheel disks of the driving wheels. The gear wheel, which is housed in an auxiliary frame outside the driving wheels and is surrounded by a protective casing, is on one side of the driving wheels. Each gear wheel is driven by an individual traction motor, which is located above the gear wheel in the locomotive body. With this implementation, a strongly one-sided weight distribution occurs in the underframe through the remote gear wheels. In order to maintain stability of the locomotive on the longitudinal axis, heavy equipment inside the locomotive body must be arranged on the opposite side of the drive equipment. Locomotives with a Buchli drive also typically have an asymmetrical appearance: on one side, the bearings of the drive wheels are visible, on the other side, they are almost completely covered by the wheel cover box of the gear wheels. Other designs Two Ae 4/7 on a trial run in 2007. Note the difference in appearance; both sides can be seen In addition to the standard implementation, there were also the following variations: Outside frame The engine framework with the driving wheel housing is outside the wheel disks of the driving wheels. The driving wheel is enclosed by a quill camped in the locomotive cabinet, on which the gear wheel sits. Examples included the Pennsylvania Railroad O1b, and the Deutsche Reichsbahn ET11.01. Group drive The motor is arranged between the floating axles. A common pinion or a pinion on both motor end drives the gear wheels of the neighbouring axes. described this design, but vehicles implementing it are not known. Bilateral drive The driving wheel is coupled with two gear wheels, and the motor has a pinion on both sides. The taps in the wheel disk are warped about 90 degrees against each other so that the drive imbalance can be reduced. This version of the driver was used for greater driving power. However with this arrangement, there is the danger of mechanical stress in the drive components. Examples included the French express train locomotives: SNCF 2D2 5400, SNCF 2D2 5500, SNCF 2D2 9100. Two motors per axis Two driving motors work on one common gear wheel, which is interconnected with a driving wheel. Examples include the Pennsylvania Railroad O1b.

The left ideal has non-zero intersection with any non-zero left ideal of R. Analogously, and essential right ideal is exactly an essential submodule of the right R module RR. The usual notations for essential extensions include the following two expressions: :N\\\\subseteq_e M\\\\, , and N\\\\trianglelefteq M The dual notion of an essential submodule is that of superfluous submodule (or small submodule). A submodule N is superfluous if for any other submodule H, :N+H=M\\\\, implies that H=M\\\\,. The usual notations for superfluous submodules include: :N\\\\subseteq_s M\\\\, , and N\\\\ll M Properties Here are some of the elementary properties of essential extensions, given in the notation introduced above. Let M be a module, and K, N and H be submodules of M with K \\\\subseteq N *Clearly M is an essential submodule of M, and the zero submodule of a nonzero module is never essential. *K\\\\subseteq_e M if and only if K\\\\subseteq_e N and N\\\\subseteq_e M *K \\\\cap H \\\\subseteq_e M if and only if K\\\\subseteq_e M and H\\\\subseteq_e M Using Zorn's Lemma it is possible to prove another useful fact: For any submodule N of M, there exists a submodule C such that :N\\\\oplus C \\\\subseteq_e M. Furthermore, a module with no proper essential extension (that is, if the module is essential in another module, then it is equal to that module) is an injective module. It is then possible to prove that every module M has a maximal essential extension E(M), called the injective hull of M. The injective hull is necessarily an injective module, and is unique up to isomorphism. The injective hull is also minimal in the sense that any other injective module containing M contains a copy of E(M). Many properties dualize to superfluous submodules, but not everything. Again let M be a module, and K, N and H be submodules of M with K \\\\subseteq N. *The zero submodule is always superfluous, and a nonzero module M is never superfluous in itself. *N\\\\subseteq_s M if and only if K\\\\subseteq_s M and N/K \\\\subseteq_s M/K *K+H\\\\subseteq_s M if and only if K\\\\subseteq_s M and H\\\\subseteq_s M. Since every module can be mapped via a monomorphism whose image is essential in an injective module (its injective hull), one might ask if the dual statement is true, i.e. for every module M, is there a projective module P and an epimorphism from P onto M whose kernel is superfluous? (Such a P is called a projective cover). The answer is \\"No\\" in general, and the special class of rings whose right modules all have projective covers is the class of right perfect rings. One form of Nakayama's lemma is that J(R)M is a superfluous submodule of M when M is a finitely- generated module over R. Generalization This definition can be generalized to an arbitrary abelian category C. An essential extension is a monomorphism u : M ‚Üí E such that for every non-zero subobject s : N ‚Üí E, the fibre product N √óE M ‚â† 0.

Biblical accounts In the Chronicler's account, Shaphan is one of three leaders sent by King Josiah of Judah to repair the temple in Jerusalem, using the temple funds to commission the necessary work. When the chief Temple priest Hilkiah discovers an ancient Torah scroll, he gives it to the Shaphan, who in turn brings it to King Josiah. Josiah reads it aloud to a crowd in Jerusalem, resulting in a great religious revival. Many scholars believe this was either a copy of the Book of Deuteronomy or a text that became a part of Deuteronomy as we have it; as a result the event is known as the Deuteronomic reform. According to the Bible, Shaphan had sons named Ahikam,See and ElasahSee and Gemariah.See The latter appears not to be the same Gemariah named as a son of Hilkiah in .See for example Harrison, R.K. (1973), Jeremiah and Lamentations: An Introduction and Commentary Leicester: IVP (131) Assuming it is the same Shaphan, he also had a son named Jaazaniah, who is among the idol worshippers depicted in the vision of Ezekiel described in . Shaphan's grandson is Gedaliah, the short-lived governor of Judah appointed by Nebuchadnezzar after the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. Whether influenced by Shaphan's part in Josiah's reforms or not, both Ahikam and, later, Gedaliah appear to have played significant roles in protecting Jeremiah from persecution.See especially Jeremiah 26:24 and 39:14; and 43:6 Bullae of Shaphan During the excavations at the City of David headed by Israeli archeologist Yigal Shiloh, a number of bullae were discovered in stratum X, destroyed by the Babylonians in ca. 586 BCE. Bulla 2 reads: belonging to Gemaryahu ben Shaphan. Shiloh posited that the Gemaryahu of this bulla is to be identified with \\"Gemaryahu son of Shaphan the scribe\\" who is mentioned in a biblical text, a figure during the reign of Jehoiakim (r. 609-598 BCE).Jeremiah 36:10 et passim If this is the case, it could confirm Gemaryahu alongside Ahikam as a son of Shaphan. However, archaeologist Yair Shoham notes: \\"It should be borne in mind, however, that the names found on the bullae were popular in ancient times and it is equally possible that there is no connection between the names found on the bullae and the person mentioned in the Bible.\\"Yair Shoham, \\"Hebrew Bullae\\" in City of David Excavations: Final Report VI, Qedem 41 (Jerusalem: Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2000), 33 See also *List of artifacts significant to the Bible References Category:Hebrew Bible people ","title":"Shaphan"},{"id":"10119273","title":"Lowndes County School District (Mississippi)"},{"id":"10119274","text":"is a Japanese musical composer originally from Hy≈çgo, Japan working for the visual novel brand Key under VisualArt's. Before forming Key, Orito worked for another software company named Leaf where he contributed to four games. After leaving Leaf, Orito transferred to another company named Tactics where he had a hand in the creation of three games for that company: D≈çsei, Moon, and One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. After forming Key, Orito has put much work into such famous titles as Kanon, Air and Clannad. Orito has been influenced by the famous Japanese composers Joe Hisaishi and Yuzo Koshiro. Career After graduating from high school, Orito went to work at a bank, but due to a recession in the economy, the bank eventually fell to restructuring, and Orito quit soon after. Orito originally found new work at the video game developer TGL composing music, but was invited by a friend from high school named Naoya Shimokawa (now the president of Aquaplus) to come work for the video game developer Leaf, which Orito accepted. Starting in 1995, Orito composed music for three of Leaf's game: DR2 Night Janki, Filsnown: Hikari to Koku, and Shizuku (precursor of To Heart). While Leaf's next game Hatsune no Naisho!! was under production, Orito quit Leaf. Orito got a part-time job working for a post office while providing outsourced musical composition for the video game developer Tactics under Nexton for the game D≈çsei; afterwards, Orito was hired into Tactics where he helped compose music for two more games: Moon, and One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. In 1999, Orito and much of the staff who made both Moon and One, including Jun Maeda, Itaru Hinoue, Naoki Hisaya, and OdiakeS, left Tactics to work under the video game publishing company VisualArt's where they formed the company Key. At Key, Orito has composed music for all of Key's titles, though he only contributed to a single track on the original soundtrack for Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet. Music that Orito composes for Key titles is published on Key's record label Key Sounds Label. The first album on the label, Humanity..., was produced by Orito for his temporary band Work-S. Orito was also the director for the remix album OTSU Club Music Compilation Vol.1, also on Key Sounds Label, and is a member of OTSU, standing for the Organized Trance Sequential Unit. During his time at Key, Orito has provided outsourced musical composition for three games by three separate companies also under VisualArt's. The first was for the game Sense Off by Otherwise, followed by the game Shoya Kinj≈ç by Giant Panda, and finally the game Realize by Playm. In 2001, Orito composed the opening and ending themes for the anime series Please Teacher!. In 2006, Orito composed the song \\"Precious\\" on Mami Kawada's debut album Seed.

It has been included on many religious-themed audio compilations, and has been covered by many singers, including Johnny Cash, Jim Reeves, Bill and Gloria Gather, the Carter Family, and Aretha Franklin.  Biography of James Cleveland Moore, Sr.  James Cleveland Moore, Sr. was born in Draketown, Georgia on May 2, 1888. He was the son of Charles Robert and Mary Ellen Hesterley Moore.  Education  Moore had intended to become a Baptist preacher. He was educated at Draketown Baptist Institute, Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, and the University of Florida. He received musical training under Benjamin B. Beale and J. Henry Showalter.  Inspiration for the Song  At 26 years old, while a seminary student at Mercer, Moore visited his hometown church to preach, Draketown Baptist Church. His father, Charles Robert Moore, had led the singing for years. Hearing his father's voice failing him, Moore knew that he would not hear his father sing much longer due to his father's advanced age. After returning to school, Moore produced the hymn and dedicated his song as: \\"Dedicated to My Father and Mother.\\" The song was not published until around 1930.  Career  In Georgia, Moore served as a Missionary Baptist minister in Funstron, Alma, Moultree, Glenwood, Willacoochee, and Abbeville. He also served in Hawthorne, Florida. Moore was also a well-known as a singer, singing teacher, and songwriter. He served as president of the Georgia- Florida-Alabama Tri-State Singing Convention for two years and of the Southern Singers‚Äô Association of Georgia. Moore is credited with writing over 500 songs in his career.  Death  Moore died in Ashburn, Turner County, Georgia, on June 1, 1962. He was buried at Bethel Baptist Church in Turner County.

Despite being executed in 1979 by Islamic Revolutionaries, he is widely lauded as the \\"father of the Iranian Air Force\\" along with general Mohammad Khatami and general Amir Hossein Rabii , for modernizing the Air Force to become a potent and powerful force whose advanced equipment and training they acquired for Iran, such as the F-14 Tomcat, would save Iran's crucial infrastructure during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. He was the Leader of the Golden Crown, the first and national aerobatics display Iranian team. He is nicknamed the \\"blue eyed general of Iran\\". By many accounts, he is considered one of the best and most capable pilots of its time. Early life and education Jahanbani was born into a family with a long military history. His father, Amanullah Jahanbani, was a lieutenant general, who served in the Persian Cossack Brigade with Reza Shah Pahlavi. He was a Qajar prince, great grandson of Fath Ali Shah. Nader's mother, Helen Kasminsky, was from the Russian aristocracy in Petrograd. He had one sister, Mehremonir and two brothers, Parviz, who was an officer in the Imperial Iranian Marines, and Khosrow, who married Shahnaz Pahlavi. Nader Jahanbani had two children from two wives, a son, Anushiravan, from his first wife, Azar Etessam, and a daughter, Golnar, from his second wife, Farah Zangeneh. Both children live in the United States. Amanullah was imprisoned when Nader Jahanbani was 12, but after Reza Shah died, he was released and made a senator by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. By then, his father sent him to the Russian Air Force Academy, from which he graduated as a foreign cadet, and entered the IIAF in 1950 with the rank of first lieutenant. In 1951, Jahanbani was selected to be sent to F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base in Germany to attend the jet pilot training school to become a pilot for the first Iranian jet fighter aircraft, the F-84 Thunderjet, which was scheduled for delivery in 1955, along with 15 other pilots. Upon completion of the training, 10 pilots returned to Iran while Jahanbani, along with four others, continued their training to become instructors upon return to Iran. Career After completing the Jet Instructor pilot course and returning to Iran, Jahanbani formed Iran's first aerobatic team, called the Golden Crown (Taje Talaii) together with other officers, including Mohammad Amir Khatami and Amir Hossein Rabi'i. Jahanbani played a crucial role in the Iranian Air Force during the 1960s and 1970s by helping to create an effective air force. He served as the Deputy Commander of the Air Force. As such, he worked hard to inculcate world-class air to air combat skills among the Iranian fighter pilots. This work, led by Jahanbani, on improving the pilots' abilities, would prove crucial to the Iranian air force in the later Iran-Iraq war, when the IRIAF pilots clearly prevailed over their Iraqi counterparts. He was also general secretary of the National Sports Federation. Death When the Shah declared martial law in response to mounting protests in 1978, and put military officers in charge, Jahanbani was not one of the military commanders, since he had very little experience with internal security affairs. As a result, when the Shah fled, despite the urging of his family, his friends in the US Air Force, as well as the Shah himself and his daughter Shahnaz (who was his sister in-law), Jahanbani falsely thought that he was safe from possible purges and retaliation against the security officials who suppressed the protests, as well as his belief that Iran's powerful air force would be a testament of his loyalty to the country, not the Shah himself. Khomeini subsequently ordered the Revolutionary Guards to arrest Jahanbani, among others, at the Air Force headquarters at Doshan Tappeh. He was one of the first of the Shah's generals to be arrested, and was sent to a court run by the infamous Sadegh Khalkhali. He was charged and convicted with: > Association with the Shah's idolatrous regime; Corruption on earth; > Unspecified anti-revolutionary offense; War on God, God's Prophet, and the > deputy of the Twelfth Imam He was taken to Qasr Prison and in the early hours of 13 March 1979 he was shot in the courtyard of the prison. His last words were \\"long live Iran\\". Empress Farah Pahlavi wrote: > \\"A bit later, I managed to contact by phone a dear friend whose husband, Air > Force Lieutenant General Nader Jahanbani, had just been executed. Insulted > by one of the guardians of the revolution, he had the courage to slap him in > the face before dying.

Via the Ohio River, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of approximately on the unglaciated portion of the Allegheny Plateau. It flows into the Ohio River in downtown Wheeling, just downstream of Ohio's Wheeling Creek on the opposite bank. A variant name is Big Wheeling Creek. Geography Wheeling Creek is formed in northeastern Marshall County, West Virginia, by the confluence of streams known as the Enlow Fork and the Dunkard Fork: *Enlow Fork, also known historically as \\"Enslow Fork,\\" rises in Pennsylvania on the boundary of Greene and Washington Counties, and flows west-southwestwardly along that boundary into Marshall County. Enlow Fork defines the northern boundaries of Morris, Gray, and Richhill Townships in Greene County; and the southern boundaries of Morris, East Finley, and West Finley townships in Washington County. *Dunkard Fork, also known historically as \\"Crow Creek,\\" is formed in Pennsylvania by the confluence of the North Fork Dunkard Fork and the South Fork Dunkard Fork in Richhill Township in Greene County, and flows northwestwardly into Marshall County. Its north and south forks each flow northwestwardly into Richhill Township; the North Fork rises in Jackson Township and flows through Ryerson Station State Park, where it is dammed to form a lake; and the South Fork rises in Aleppo Township. From the confluence of the Dunkard and Enlow forks, Wheeling Creek flows northwestwardly into the city of Wheeling in Ohio County. In the Elm Grove neighborhood of Wheeling, it collects Little Wheeling Creek, which rises in Ohio County just west of the Pennsylvania state line and flows southwestwardly through the communities of Valley Grove and Triadelphia. In Triadelphia, Little Wheeling Creek collects Middle Wheeling Creek, which rises in West Finley Township in Greene County, Pennsylvania, and flows generally westwardly into southeastern Ohio County. The National Road (U.S. Route 40) parallels Little Wheeling Creek through eastern Ohio County, and follows Wheeling Creek for part of its route through the city of Wheeling; the creek is also paralleled for five miles (8 km) in Wheeling by a rail trail as part of the Wheeling Heritage Trail network. According to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, of the drained by Wheeling Creek in West Virginia, approximately 67% is forested; approximately 27% is used for agriculture; and approximately 5% is urban. Flow rate The United States Geological Survey operates a stream gauge on the creek in the Elm Grove neighborhood of Wheeling, downstream of the mouth of Little Wheeling Creek and 7.8 miles (12.6 km) upstream of the creek's mouth. Between 1941 and 2005, the annual mean flow of the creek at the gauge was 343 cubic feet per second (9.7 m¬≥/s). The creek's highest flow during the period was estimated at 22,300 ft¬≥/s (632 m¬≥/s) on September 17, 2004. The lowest recorded flow was 0.1 ft¬≥/s (0 m¬≥/s) on October 7, 1963, and on two days in September 1964. Fishing Wheeling Creek is a popular fishing destination to those close to it. There are many entry points located alongside the Wheeling Heritage Trail System. There are a variety of fish species including muskellunge, smallmouth bass, sunfish, hognose suckers, various species of catfish, and bluegill.

It is the center of the small Dhruma Governorate of Riyadh Province, and had a population of 10,267 people according to the 2004 census. It lies in the wide Al-Batin valley, which it shares with its larger twin, Muzahmiyya. History The town appears in the 7th century poetry of Jarir as \\"Qarma\\" or \\"Garma\\", and is also mentioned by the same name in Yaqut's encyclopedia. It is unknown, however, when exactly the name evolved into \\"Dhruma\\". The village was important in pre-20th century Nejd as a western gateway to the region of Wadi Hanifa, which includes Riyadh and Diriyah, and often bore the brunt of the military campaigns directed at the region. Its traditional rulers were distant cousins of the Al Saud family, and Dhruma joined the First Saudi State at the end of the 18th century. A large invasion of Saudi-ruled territory by the Yam tribe of Najran, some 1000 km to the south, was repelled by the people of Dhruma in 1775 after an intense battle fought in a nearby forest of palm trees. Later, the Egyptian-Ottoman forces of Ibrahim Pasha placed the town under siege on their way to the Saudi capital of Diriyah (see Saudi-Ottoman War). Dhruma offered remarkably stout resistance to the invading army, and even rejected Ibrahim's offer of a truce in exchange for allowing him to proceed to Diriyah. The town, however, surrendered in early 1818 and Ibrahim's retribution was especially harsh, allowing his troops to pillage the village with impunity. The town revived somewhat after those events, and was reported by Philby to have had a population of nearly 6,000 in 1917. Its fortunes have fallen dramatically in recent decades, however, because it was bypassed by the modern Riyadh-Mecca highway, and most of its original inhabitants have moved to neighboring Riyadh.
