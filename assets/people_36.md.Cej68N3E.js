She is a member of the New Democratic Party (NDP). In Brosseau's first election campaign, she gained national attention for her surprising rise from a \\"paper candidate\\" to a viable contestant; she also gained the nickname \\"Vegas Girl\\" for a mid- election vacation to Las Vegas. She won reelection in the 2015 federal election with a larger vote share despite her party falling from second to third place nationally. Her parliamentary roles included House Leader of the NDP, critic for Agriculture and Agri-Food and deputy NDP caucus chair. Early and personal life Brosseau was born in Ottawa, and lived in Hudson, Quebec, before her family moved to Kingston, Ontario. Brosseau's father, Marc, is a francophone, who is also fluent in English. Brosseau was educated in French both in Quebec and in Ontario. She attended St. Lawrence College in Kingston, but left prior to completing her diploma. Before her election to Parliament, Brosseau was an assistant manager for Oliver's Pub, a bar on the campus of Carleton University in Ottawa. She also worked as a bartender at Pier 21 on the Market near the Parliament and the University of Ottawa. She is also an animal welfare activist who has worked to find homes for stray animals and help injured animals recover. Brosseau is a single mother. She gave birth when she was 17 and finished high school partly through the use of correspondence courses. Her son does not have any contact with his biological father. As a young mother Brosseau cleaned hotel rooms and was fired after she tried to organize the employees. During her tenure as MP, Brosseau divided her time between her riding and Hull, Quebec, in the National Capital Region. By 2019, Brosseau was in a relationship with Nicolas Gauthier, a farmer in Yamachiche, Quebec. Before her defeat in the 2019 Canadian federal election, Brosseau stated that she planned to remain in the area regardless of the outcome of the election. Political career=2011 election Brosseau first ran for a seat to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2011 federal election, as the New Democratic Party candidate in the electoral district of Berthier‚ÄîMaskinong√© in central Quebec. She was the second nomination choice of the party as the original candidate, Julie Demers, chose to run in Bourassa. Brosseau was a paper candidate who had been selected by the party due to the lack of a viable local nominee. She agreed to run after being asked by politically active friends who frequented the bar she worked. The vegetarian Brosseau knew nothing about politics or the riding, with many pork and beef farmers, and a travel time of three-and-one-half hours away from her Ottawa home by car. She did not expect to win, did not campaign, and never went to the riding, which straddles Lanaudi√®re and Mauricie. During the election, Brosseau went on vacation to Las Vegas for her birthday. Her trip had been arranged prior to the election being called; by the time the writ was dropped, it was too late to reschedule or get a refund. The media mocked her as \\"Vegas girl\\", but NDP leader Jack Layton defended Brosseau's decision to vacation, pinning the blame on Stephen Harper not keeping his promise on fixed election dates. An op-ed in the National Post criticized Brosseau's inexperience, writing that she is \\"an extreme example of what happens when people sign up to run for a party with little or no expectation of actually winning\\". On election night, Brosseau defeated incumbent Bloc Qu√©b√©cois Member of Parliament Guy Andr√©, former provincial Liberal MNA Francine Gaudet and three other candidates, winning a plurality with 22,484 votes, representing just under 40% of all the votes cast. This represented a lead of 5,816 votes over Andr√©, who finished a distant second with only 29.4 percent of the vote. Her victory was part of a wave of NDP support in Quebec that increased its standing in the province from one seat to 59. Brosseau's proficiency in French was unclear; 98% of Berthier-Maskinong√©'s residents are francophone, and 77 percent of them do not speak English, while she was unable to conduct an interview in French when elected. At a press conference held the day after Brosseau's election, Thomas Mulcair, then the NDP co-deputy leader and Quebec lieutenant, addressed her language issues. While conceding that Brosseau's command of French was \\"not at a level we would expect for a riding like Berthier‚ÄîMaskinong√©\\", he personally promised to \\"help organize her office\\" and \\"give her all the help that's needed.\\" Two days after the election, allegations were made by both the defeated Liberal and Conservative candidates about irregularities on Brosseau's nomination papers, which the other parties had chosen not to vet because of low expectations of her winning. The local Liberal and Conservative associations called for a by-election, but Elections Canada found Brosseau's nomination papers to be in order and subsequently ruled that only a court can order new elections. Both parties subsequently declined to file a formal court challenge. In response to the allegations, the NDP released a statement, stating that \\"All signatures were collected legitimately, the documents were tabled with Elections Canada and they were approved by the Returning Officer.\\" 41st Parliament Immediately following her election, Brosseau began working with Kathleen Monk, the NDP's director of communication in 2011, to tackle some of the challenges she faced as a new MP. She avoided the media and met with mayors and local business owners in her riding to get a grasp of her new constituents. When discussing her political career, Monk said, \\"There were many people in the media and political backrooms who didn‚Äôt think or frankly want her to succeed.\\" When Brosseau officially opened her constituency office in Louiseville in July 2011 her French was described as \\"still hesitant\\". Le Nouvelliste described her as speaking \\"increasingly fluid French\\" in December. Brosseau stated that her constituency offices functioned \\"100% in French\\" and that she continued to take lessons three times a week. By April 2012 the Canadian Press stated that \\"original claims about her lack of proficiency in the language now appear exaggerated\\". It reported that the rumours about Brosseau's lack of proficiency in French benefited her, as many constituents believed that she was a monolingual anglophone when elected and were amazed by her apparently rapidly improving French. Brosseau said that she grew up speaking French as a child, and understood the language, but did not feel comfortable speaking it during the campaign because she had been out of practice. By 2015 Chatelaine described Brosseau as being fluently bilingual, and TVA Nouvelles said that she spoke \\"a French almost without accent\\". On April 19, 2012, Brosseau was named deputy agriculture critic in the NDP's shadow cabinet, and on April 3, 2014, she was elected as vice-chair of the NDP National Caucus. Brosseau earned praise from her caucus colleagues and national media, with Malcolm Allen remarking that \\"lots of MPs work hard, but she has a great work ethic\\". As a single mother, she often raised issues faced by those in a similar position during parliamentary debates. Chatelaine said in 2015 that, despite early criticism, \\"the 31-year-old has quietly evolved into an effective and highly regarded politician\\". In 2013, Brosseau became the NDP's lead on the student loan data breach, in part because she was personally impacted by the incident. Brosseau championed local causes important to her riding such as high repair costs to fix defective home foundations built with pyrrhotite mixed in with concrete, an issue that she brought up 70 times in the 41st Parliament. Although she never managed to get the Harper government to join the provincial government in providing compensation, she and fellow NDP MP Robert Aubin were credited with influencing Justin Trudeau's promise that a Liberal government would do so. 2015 election and 42nd Parliament In 2014, Brosseau announced that she would be a candidate in the 2015 federal election. Speaking with Mark Kennedy of the Ottawa Citizen, Brosseau spoke about the difficulties she faced during her first years as an MP, but noted, \\"It took a while to kind of get my feet planted, set up an office, learn what the job was. The negativity only encouraged me to work harder\\". While the NDP's Quebec caucus was reduced to 16 seats during the election, Brosseau was one of the few NDP MPs elected in 2011 who not only kept their seats, but also increased their vote share, winning re-election with 42% of the vote (almost 3% more than her first election) and almost 10,000 votes over her nearest opponent. The New York Times attributed Brosseau's reelection to her focus on the pyrrhotite issue. Brosseau was appointed the NDP critic for Agriculture and Agri-food in the 42nd Canadian Parliament. In May 2016, an incident in the House of Commons arose where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accidentally hit Brosseau in the chest. The controversial situation arose after Trudeau was attempting to lead Conservative Party Whip Gord Brown to his seat so a scheduled vote could take place. Leading up to the incident dubbed \\"Elbowgate\\", the Opposition parties had accused the government trying to ram Bill C-14 through the House and Senate, using various strategies like assigning a time limit to debate and giving enormous powers to ministers. Brosseau rose in the House on a point of personal privilege and placed a description of the incident into the Hansard by describing the incident on the record, and Trudeau apologized more than once, indicating his lack of intention to hurt anyone. The following day, Brosseau claimed she had become a target of personal attacks, saying that her office received a number of phone calls from members of the public, many of which suggested she was \\"crying wolf\\". Senior figures and colleagues from both the Liberal and Conservative parties subsequently came to her defence. It was referred to in the House of Commons as \\"the matter of the physical molestation of the Member from Berthier‚ÄîMaskinong√©\\". In January 2018, newly elected NDP leader Jagmeet Singh named her as the NDP House Leader. She was succeeded in March 2019 by Peter Julian, her predecessor in the prior year. 2019 election In the October 21, 2019 general election, the NDP lost all of their remaining seats in Quebec except the one held by party regional lieutenant Alexandre Boulerice. Brosseau was defeated by Bloc Qu√©b√©cois candidate Yves Perron who won 21,007 votes (37.4%) to her 19,500 (34.7%).

Though Wyoming beat BYU and San Jose State the next game without the players to go to they lost all four road games in November and went the next year, which prompted the school to reassign head coach Lloyd Eaton to assistant The incident also affected the University to successfully recruit African American players for several years, with the football team posting only one winning season during the 1970s. None of the players was able to transfer to another major college football program, which has been speculated in the media that it was because of the incident. Three of the players (John Griffin, Don Meadows and Ted Williams) came back to play for Eaton in the 1970 season. At least 3 other players (Tony McGee, Ron Hill and Jerry Berry ) transferred to predominantly African-American colleges.

Vaguely bell- shaped, its boundaries are marked by Bradhurst Road and E. Belvedere Avenue (north), Woodbourne Avenue (south), Lothian Road (west) and Northwood Drive (east). Public school transformations Chinquapin Middle School, located at 900 Woodbourne Avenue in Cameron Village, was formerly known as Woodbourne Junior High School. This school became the focus of controversy about prayer and Bible readings in public schools in 1960. Madalyn Murray O'Hair, whose son was attending Woodbourne Junior High School, filed a lawsuit against the city school system protesting compulsory Bible verse recitations and prayer in public schools. The Supreme Court ruled in her favor in the 1963 decision of Abington School District v. Schempp. The city closed Chinquapin as a middle school in 2010, replacing it with the Baltimore IT Academy Transformation School, a new program operating in the same building. In the new program, students in grades 6-12 study a career-oriented curriculum emphasizing math and information technology. Public transportation Route 36 (MTA Maryland) provides bus service along Maryland Route 542 (The Alameda), passing through the southeast corner of Cameron Village. Along the neighborhood's northern edge, Route 44 (MTA Maryland) has stops on E. Belvedere Avenue. The U.S. Census estimated that in 2009 about a third of the neighborhood's employed population relied on buses to get to work. Demographics The 2000 census reported 16.9 percent of Cameron Village families with income below the poverty line, compared with a citywide average of 22.9 percent. Median household income for 2009 was estimated at $39,805 for Cameron Village, somewhat better than the Baltimore median of $38,772.

Overview Quorum was part of the North Tyneside Enterprise Zone that ran from 1996 to 2006. The site was originally occupied by the US Corporation Viasystems who had a major semiconductor manufacturing plant on the site. When that plant closed, the site was bought by the current owners who redeveloped the site into a major Business Park. Funding for the development was raised by Tritax with construction undertaken by Grantside, both joint venture partners in the development company. Development Director Fergus Trim was recruited in 2008 to lead a major 450,000sqft phase of development and to head up the management and marketing of Quorum. In 2009 and 2010 Quorum made the headlines with a series of lettings including some notable job creating inward investments. Almost 250,000sqft of office space was let to six new companies including major occupiers such as Tesco Bank, Balfour Beatty and Convergys. British Engines relocated their central core services teams to the park in December 2013.

Volasertib is the second in a novel class of drugs called dihydropteridinone derivatives. Volasertib was awarded breakthrough drug status in September 2013 and orphan drug status for acute myeloid leukemia in April 2014. Mechanism of action Volasertib is a novel small-molecule targeted therapy that blocks cell division by competitively binding to the ATP-binding pocket of the PLK1 protein. PLK1 proteins are found in the nuclei of all dividing cells and control multiple stages of the cell cycle and cell division. The levels of the PLK1 protein are tightly controlled and are raised in normal cells that are dividing. Raised levels of the PLK1 protein are also found in many cancers including; breast, non-small cell lung, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, papillary thyroid, ovarian, head and neck and Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs Lymphoma. Raised levels of PLK1 increase the probability of improper segregation of chromosomes which is a critical stage in the development of many cancers. Raised levels of PLK1 have been associated with a poorer prognosis and overall survival in some cancers In addition to its role in cell division, there is evidence that PLK1 also interacts with components of other pathways involved in cancer development including the K-Ras oncogene and the retinoblastoma and p53 tumour suppressors These observations have led to PLK1 being recognised as an important target in the treatment of cancer. Volasertib can be taken either orally or via intravenous infusion, once circulating in the blood stream it is distributed throughout the body, crosses the cell membrane and enters the nucleus of cells where it binds to its target; PLK1. Volasertib inhibits PLK1 preventing its roles in the cell-cycle and cell division which leads to cell arrest and programmed cell death. Volasertib binds to and inhibits PLK1 at nanomolar doses however, it has also been shown to inhibit other PLK family members; PLK2 and PLK3 at higher; micromolar doses. The roles of PLK2 and PLK3 are less well understood; however they are known to be active during the cell cycle and cell division. Volasertib inhibits PLK1 in both cancer and normal cells; however it only causes irreversible inhibition and cell death in cancer cells, because inhibition of PLK1 in cancer cells arrests the cell cycle at a different point to normal, non-cancer cells. In cancer cells PLK1 inhibition results in G2/M cell cycle arrest followed by programmed cell death, however, in normal cells inhibition of PLK1 only causes temporary, reversible G1 and G2 arrest without programmed cell death. This specificity for cancer cells improves the efficacy of the drug and minimizes the drug related toxicity. Adverse effects One of the undesirable effects of small-molecule drugs is that they can lack specificity for their target; hence bind to similar targets in other unrelated proteins, which can result in undesirable drug-related side effects. However, pre-clinical studies have shown volasertib binds in a highly selective manner to the kinase domain of the PLK family, without binding to other proteins with a kinase domain. Clinical studies have shown that at the maximum tolerated dose, side effects of volasertib include; anaemia (22%), thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Common side effects as seen with other antimitotic agents such as vinca alkaloids and taxanes which include neuropathy, have not been observed with volasertib. Studies Preclinical studies on volasertib have demonstrated that it is highly effective at binding to and blocking PLK1 function and causing programmed cell death in colon and non-small cell lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Volasertib can also cause cell death in cancer cells that have are no longer sensitive to existing anti-mitotic drugs such as vinca alkaloids and taxanes. This suggests that volasertib may be effective when used as a second line treatment in patients who have developed resistance to vinca alkaloid and taxane chemotherapeutics. A first in man trial of volasertib in 65 patients with solid cancers reported that the drug is safe to administer to patients and is stable in the bloodstream. This study also reported favourable anti-cancer activity of the drug; three patients achieved a partial response, 48% of patients achieved stable disease and 6 patients achieved progression free survival of greater than 6 months. A further phase 1 trial of volasertib in combination with cytarabine in patients with relapsed / refractory acute myeloid leukemia reported that 5 of 28 patients underwent a complete response, 2 achieved a partial response and a further 6 patients no worsening of their disease. Clinical trials Volasertib is currently undergoing investigation in phase I and II trials and has yet to be licensed by the FDA. Volasertib may be effective in several malignancies evidenced by the fact that its target PLK1 is overexpressed in up to 80% of malignancies, where it has been associated with a poorer treatment outcome and reduced overall survival. Further phase 1 and 2 trials are active, investigating the effects of Volasertib both as a single agent and in combination with other agents in solid tumors and hematological malignancies including; ovarian cancer, urothelial cancer and acute myeloid leukaemia, lymphomas, myelodysplastic syndromes, and non-small call lung cancer. it is in one phase III trial (for AML in over 65s), due to complete in February 2017.

The episode was written by Leila Gerstein and directed by Andrew McCarthy. It originally aired on Monday, May 2, 2011 on the CW. Executive producer Joshua Safran was criticized for the depiction of perceived relationship abuse and domestic violence in a controversial scene of the episode and negative reactions towards the character of Chuck Bass. \\"The Princesses and the Frog\\" reveals Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) pursuing a fairytale romance with Louis Grimaldi (Hugo Becker) as she faces the challenge of winning the approval of Princess Sophie (Joanne Whalley) and possibly earns more than a royal approval, while Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) attempts to ruin Blair by airing out every scandal she can draw out. Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) slowly devolves into a downward spiral the longer he holds on the secret disappearance of Avery Thorpe. Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford) finds himself torn between his relationship with Raina Thorpe (Tika Sumpter) and his friendship with Chuck. Vanessa Abrams (Jessica Szohr) befriends Charlie Rhodes (Kaylee DeFer) for reasons that revolve around Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley). Plot Chuck (Ed Westwick) informing his P.I that he doesn't believe his father is responsible for the murder of Avery Thorpe - Raina's mother - and for him to drop the case. Serena, on the phone to Blair, finds that her attempt to break up Louis and Blair has only made them stronger thus far. She fakes being happy for them, and afterwards explains to Eric that she is trying to break them up because Blair crossed \\"sacred territory\\" when she kissed Dan. Eric tells her off, saying that acting like Blair is no way to go on. However, Serena still seems determined to break them up. Back in the apartment, Rufus announces that the meeting with the band went well, and he has invited them round for dinner. Eric mocks him on his 'street cred', so Rufus moves the dinner from the penthouse to his apartment back in Brooklyn. Blair arrives at Chuck's, where he tells her that he needs her now more than before, because the only thing that's been real in his life has been her. Blair tells him about Louis proposal, and that even though she wanted to be Chuck's for so long, she can't be anymore. Chuck gets violent, punching a glass wall which in turn cuts Blair's face. Blair flees, and a watching Nate realises the extent of Chuck's problem, and calls Raina to tell him he chooses her. At the same time, Raina is on the phone to Jack Bass, hoping to get his help with dealing with Chuck. Chuck is seen sitting alone, holding his engagement ring. Blair, still at odds with Serena, calls her mother, to tell her she's engaged. Production The Borgias actress Joanne Whalley had been cast in an episode of Gossip Girl following a Screen Actors Guild casting notice. Whalley was rumoured to play an adversarial role to Kelly Rutherford's Lily van der Woodsen but turned out to be that of Princess Sophie, Louis Grimaldi's mother. The party at the Mon√©gasque Embassy was filmed in the Ukrainian Institute of America on Fifth Avenue. Reception \\"The Princesses and the Frog\\" was watched by 1.27 million live viewers and achieved a 1.5 rating in The CW's target audience of Women 18-34 and received mixed to negative reviews. The episode received negative remarks following a controversial scene of Chuck Bass subjecting what many perceived to be domestic violence to Blair Waldorf. The Los Angeles Times' Judy Berman praised the direction of the episode, \\"\\"Gossip Girl\\" is finally fun to watch again. The writers pulled out all the stops this week: Glass shatters! Blood spills! Engagement rings gleam! Friends and near-strangers double-cross each other! A disastrously drunk Chuck Bass revives his catchphrase, \\"I'm Chuck Bass\\"! Even Nate earns his screen time.\\" Steve Marsi of TV Fanatic however, had mixed reviews regarding the episode, stating the overall narrative \\"felt sorely lacking.\\" and that the plot lines \\"became really twisted and confusing and the relationships too tangential.\\" Serena's actions throughout the episode were called out, followed by Chuck's slow downward spiral that culminated in forcing himself on Blair. Marsi continued his review on Chuck, stating that his behavior \\"leaves little room for redemption\\". The sudden absence of Dan and Blair's relationship was panned by Marsi, who disapproved of the lack of interaction between the two characters. New York Magazine hailed the return of Nate and Chuck's \\"bromance\\", praised the change of direction for the character of Charlie, and Blair dating prince but generally panned the episode for its shortcomings and the closing scene. Chris Rovar and Jessica Pressler hoped that the show \\"could make it up in the coming weeks.\\" Charlie Rhodes became the subject of praise with her successful integration into the Upper East side. Marsi praised her choosing to confront Vanessa alone, calling her \\"a natural\\" at schemes and that \\"even an outsider can thoroughly outshine an outcast.\\" TV Guide praised the ousting of Vanessa by Charlie, stating that \\"it didn't take her long to cross over to \\"the other side\\"\\". Serena van der Woodsen's actions throughout the episode received negative reviews. New York Magazine called out her character inconsistency and Serena's actions against Blair, \\"as much as this show has tried to teach us that nobody can be trusted and any friend will turn on another at the drop of the hat, we really don‚Äôt believe that Serena would go so far out of her way to ruin Blair‚Äôs chance to be a princess just because Blair once kissed Dan (whom Serena isn‚Äôt dating and is related to). It just doesn‚Äôt make sense.\\" Berman noticed her abrupt change in character, stating \\"It's a pretty evil, slightly out-of-character move, and S spends most of the episode looking conflicted over what she's done.\\"  Controversy  Following the 20th episode of Season 4, Safran spoke on behalf of the series regarding the scene in which Chuck became violent with Blair. In response to these comments, Carina MacKenzie of Zap2it stated, \\"We're left wondering if Safran missed the part where she went home bleeding because Chuck was using physical intimidation to release his own emotions.\\" PerezHilton.com also disagreed with the show's decision to rationalize Chuck's behavior as \\"passion\\". The site further stated, \\"Is this what the writers and crew want to showcase to their audience? That it's okay to treat the supposed love of your life like this because you're going through 'issues?' \\" While reviewing the episode, Tierney Bricker of Zap2it remarked that there were \\"really no excuses for Chuck Bass anymore.\\" MacKenzie concluded that Chuck's behavior throughout Season 4 fit the signs of an abusive relationship, citing examples from HelpGuide.org, a non-profit health resource. She noted Chuck's public humiliation of Blair, his attempt to pawn her during a business deal, and his use of physical intimidation. MacKenzie also called the show's explanation \\"disturbing, particularly given the young, female target demographic of Gossip Girl and The CW.\\" Berman later addressed Safran's description of the controversial scene. \\"Considering how terrified Blair looked at the end of their encounter, and how quickly she got out of there, the show is sending a mixed message at best.\\" She went on to state, \\"We have no right to expect Gossip Girl to be a paragon of morality, or even realism, but the idea that true love requires taking a shard of glass to the face is disturbing even in this alternate, soap-opera dimension.\\" References Category:Gossip Girl (season 4) episodes Category:2011 American television episodes ","title":"The Princesses and the Frog"},{"id":"31665900","text":"Nellu may refer to * Nellu (1974 film), a landmark Malayalam film starring Prem Nazir * Nellu (2010 film), a Tamil drama film ","title":"Nellu"},{"id":"31665917","text":"All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace is a BBC television documentary series by filmmaker Adam Curtis. In the series, Curtis argues that computers have failed to liberate humanity, and instead have \\"distorted and simplified our view of the world around us.\\" The title is taken from a 1967 poem of the same name by Richard Brautigan. The first episode was originally broadcast at 9 pm on 23 May 2011. Episodes=Part 1. 'Love and Power' In the first episode, Curtis traces the effects of Ayn Rand's ideas on American financial markets, particularly via the influence of Alan Greenspan, who was a member of a reading group called the Collective, which discussed her work and her philosophy of Objectivism. While Rand's novels were critically savaged, they inspired people working in the technology sector of Silicon Valley, leading to the emergence of the Californian Ideology, a techno-utopian belief that computer networks could measure, control and help to stabilise societies without hierarchical political control. Rand had an affair with Nathaniel Branden, another member of The Collective, with the approval of Brandan's wife, Barbara Branden. The affair would eventually end acrimoniously and the Collective disbanded. Rand's circle of friends contracted considerably, though Greenspan remained loyal to her. Alan Greenspan Greenspan entered government in the 1970s and became Chairman of the Federal Reserve. In 1992, he visited the newly-elected Bill Clinton and persuaded him to curtail U.S. government intervention in the economy, letting the markets manage themselves with the help of computer modelling to predict risks and hedge against them, a paradigm named \\"the New Economy\\". However, by 1996, production figures failed to increase, but profits were nevertheless rising. Greenspan worried that unsustainable speculative bubbles were forming, but after political attacks from all sides, Greenspan changed his reasoning and suggested that new efficiencies had emerged that his data wasn't measuring. In parallel with this, American investors began pouring large sums of money into economies in eastern Asia, though the Council of Economic Advisers, lead by Joseph Stiglitz, began warning that these economies were much more fragile than they seemed. However, these warnings did not reach the president, having been blocked by Robert Rubin, who feared damage to financial interests. The 1997 Asian financial crisis began as the property bubble in the Far East began to burst in, first in Thailand, then later in South Korea and Indonesia, causing large financial losses in those countries that greatly affected foreign investors. While Bill Clinton was preoccupied with the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Robert Rubin took control of foreign policy and forced loans onto the affected countries. However, after each country agreed to be bailed out by the IMF, foreign investors immediately withdrew their money, destroying their economies and leaving their taxpayers with enormous debts. Robert Rubin Alan Greenspan would rise to greater prominence after his handling of the economic effects of the September 11 attacks, later cutting interest rates in the wake of the Enron scandal in a bid to stimulate the economy. Unusually, this triggered a consumer boom without creating inflation, creating new certainty that the New Economy truly existed. However, in reality, to avoid a repeat of the earlier economic crises in East Asia, China's Politburo had decided to influence America's economy via similar techniques to those used by America on other Far Eastern countries. By keeping China's exchange rate artificially low, they sold cheap goods to America, using the proceeds to buy American bonds. The money flooding into America reduced the perception of risk in signing loans to lower income clients, permitting lending beyond the point that was actually sustainable. The high level of loan defaulting that followed led ultimately to the 2007-08 financial crisis, caused by the collapse of a housing bubble similar to that which Far Eastern countries had previously faced. In 1994, Carmen Hermosillo published a widely influential essay online, \\"Pandora's Vox: On Community in Cyberspace\\",\\"Introducing Humdog: Pandora's Vox Redux\\", Folksonomy.co. and it began to be argued that the use of computer networks had led not to a reduction in hierarchy, but actually a commodification of personality and a complex transfer of power and information to corporations. Curtis ends the piece by pointing out that not only has the idea of market stability failed to bear out in practice, but that the Californian Ideology has also been unable to bring about long-term stability. Curtis contends that the ideology had not freed its proponents from hierarchies, but has instead trapped them in a rigid system of control from which they are unable to escape. =Contributors= * Barbara Branden, member of Ayn Rand's circle, 1950s * John McCaskey, Digital Entrepreneur, Silicon Valley, 1990s * Kevin O'Connor, Internet Entrepreneur, Silicon Valley, 1990s * Loren Carpenter and Rachel Carpenter * Kevin Kelly, Wired Magazine * Stewart Brand, Global Business Network * Alvin Toffler, Digital Futurologist * Peter Schwartz, Global Business Network * Kenichi Ohmae, author, The End of the Nation State * Nathaniel Branden, Ayn Rand's lover * Joan Mitchell * Stephen Roach, Chief Economist, Morgan Stanley 1990s * Joseph Stiglitz, Head of the Council of Economic Advisers 1995‚Äì97 * Robert Rubin, US Secretary of the Treasury 1995‚Äì99 Part 2. 'The Use and Abuse of Vegetational Concepts' This episode investigates how ideas such as cybernetics and systems theory were applied to natural ecosystems, creating a mechanical view of the natural world, and how this relates to the false idea that there is a balance of nature. The idea of ecosystems was proposed in 1935 by Arthur Tansley, an English botanist, based on his belief that the whole of the natural world operated as a series of interconnected networks. Taken together with Jay Forrester's work in cybernetic systems, which posited that all networks are regulated by feedback loops, the belief emerged that the natural world is composed of self-regulating ecosystems that tends towards balance and equilibrium. Norbert Wiener laid out the position that humans, machines and ecology are simply nodes in a network in his book Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, and this book became the bible of cybernetics. Brothers Howard T. Odum and Eugene Odum, both ecologists, further developed these ideas; Howard collected data from ecological systems and built electronic networks to simulate them, and his brother Eugene then took these ideas and generalised them to the whole of ecology. The idea that the natural world tended towards balance became conventional wisdom among scientists. In the 1960s, Buckminster Fuller invented a radically new kind of structure, the geodesic dome, which emulated ecosystems in being made of highly connected, relatively weak parts, which built a stronger structure. It was applied to the radomes covering early warning systems in the Arctic. His other system-based ideas inspired the counterculture movement. Communes of people who saw themselves as nodes in a network, without hierarchy, and applied feedback to try to control and stabilise their societies, used his geodesic domes as habitats. Around this time, Stewart Brand filmed a demonstration of a networked computer system with a graphics display, mouse and keyboard that he believed would save the world by empowering people, in a similar way to the communes, to be free as individuals. In 1967, Richard Brautigan published the poetry work All Watched Over by machines of Loving Grace, which promoted the idea of a cybernetic ecological utopia consisting of a fusion of computers and organisms living in perfect harmony and stability. Jan Smuts By the 1970s, new challenges emerged that could not be solved by normal hierarchical systems, such as overpopulation, limited natural resources and pollution. Jay Forrester applied systems theory to the problem and drew a cybernetic system diagram for the world. This was turned into a computer model which predicted population collapse. This became the basis of the model that was used by the Club of Rome, and the findings from this were published in The Limits to Growth. Forrester then argued for zero growth in order to maintain a steady equilibrium within the capacity of the Earth. However, this was opposed by many people within the environmental movement, since the model did not allow for people to change their values to stabilise the world, and they argued that the model tried to maintain and enforce the current political hierarchy. Critics compared Forrester's ideas to a dispute between Arthur Tansley and Field Marshal Jan Smuts. Smuts had invented a philosophy called holism, where everyone had a 'rightful place', which was to be managed by the white race, which Tansley called an \\"abuse of vegetational concepts.\\" The 70s protestors claimed that the same conceptual abuse of the supposed natural order was occurring, that it was really being used for political control. The belief in the stability of natural systems began to break down when a study was made of the predator-prey relationship of wolves and elks. It was found that populations of predators and prey had varied wildly over centuries. Other studies then found huge variations, and a significant lack of homeostasis in natural systems. George Van Dyne then tried to build a computer model to try to simulate a complete ecosystem based on extensive real-world data, to show how the stability of natural systems actually worked. To his surprise, the computer model did not stabilise like the Odums' electrical model had. The reason for this lack of stabilisation was that he had used extensive data which more accurately reflected reality, whereas the Odums and other ecologists had \\"ruthlessly simplified nature.\\" The scientific idea had thus been shown to fail, but the popular idea remained in currency, and even grew as it apparently offered the possibility of a new egalitarian world order. In 2003, a wave of spontaneous revolutions swept through Asia and Europe. Coordinated only via the internet, nobody seemed to be in overall charge, and no overall aims except self-determination and freedom were apparent. This seemed to justify the beliefs of the computer utopians. However, the freedom from these revolutions lasted for only a short time, with most of the countries falling back into political corruption almost immediately. Curtis compares them with the hippy communes, all of which broke up within a few years, as aggressive members of the group began to bully the weaker ones, who were unable to band together in their own defence because formal power structures were prohibited by the commune's rules, and even intervention against bullying by benevolent individuals was discouraged. Curtis closes the episode by stating that it has become apparent that while the self-organising network is good at organising change, they fail to provide direction for determining what comes afterwards; networks leave people helpless in the face of those who already wield political power. =Contributors= * Peder Anker, historian of ecology * Jay Forrester, systems theorist * Fred Turner, historian of media and technology * Peter J.

'The Monkey in the Machine and the Machine in the Monkey' This episode looks into the selfish gene theory invented by William Hamilton, which holds that humans are machines controlled by genes. Curtis also covers the source of ethnic conflict that was created by Belgian colonialism's artificial creation of a racial divide and the ensuing slaughter that occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is a source of raw material for computers and cell phones. In the 1930s, Armand Denis made films that told the world about Africa. However, his documentary gave fanciful stories about Rwanda's Tutsis being a noble ruling elite originally from Egypt, whereas the Hutus were a peasant race. In reality, they were racially the same, but the Belgian rulers had ruthlessly exploited the myth to divide the Rwandan people. But when it came to independence, liberal Belgians felt guilty, and decided the Hutus should overthrow the Tutsi rule. This led to a bloodbath, as the Tutsis were then seen as aliens and were slaughtered. In 1960, Congo had become independent from Belgium, but governance promptly collapsed, and towns became battle grounds as soldiers fought for control of the mines. America and the Belgians organised a coup, and the elected leader, Patrice Lumumba, was kidnapped and executed, causing chaos. However, the Western mining operations were initially largely unaffected. Mobutu Sese Seko was installed as president, killed his opponents and stopped a liberal democracy from forming. Mobutu changed the Congo's name to Zaire, looting millions of dollars and letting mines and industries collapse. In Congo, with a civil war ongoing, Dian Fossey, who was researching gorillas, was captured. She escaped and created a new camp high up on a mountain in Rwanda, where she continued to study gorillas. She tried to completely protect the gorillas, which were very susceptible to human diseases and were hated because they terrorised the local people. Fossey sabotaged the local people's traps and tried to terrorise them by claiming to cast spells on them. Ultimately, Fossey's favourite gorilla, Digit, was killed by the vengeful locals. Curtis draws a parallel between Fossey and the colonialists who oppressed the Congolese, describing her as one of many westerners who brutalised and terrorised African peoples for their own high-minded ideals. John von Neumann in the 1940s Bill Hamilton was a solitary man who saw everything through the lens of Darwin's theory of evolution. He wanted to know why some ants and humans give up their life for others. In 1963, he realised that most of the behaviours of humans were due to genes, and he began looking at humans from the genes' point of view. From this perspective, humans were machines that were only important for carrying genes, and it made sense for a gene to sacrifice a human if it meant that another copy of the gene would survive. In 1967, American chemist George R. Price went to London after reading Hamilton's little-known papers and discovering that his equations for the behaviours of genes were equivalent to computers equations. He was able to show that these equations explained murder, warfare, suicide, goodness and spite, since these actions could help the genes. John von Neumann had invented self-reproducing machines, but Price was able to show that the self- reproducing machines were already in existence ‚Äî humans were such machines. These revelations had an enormous effect on Price. Previously a staunch rationalist, Price began to believe that these equations had been given to him by God, even though some argue that they are evidence against the existence of God. In 1973, after converting to extreme Christianity as a last chance to disprove the selfish gene theories' gloomy conclusions, Price decided to start helping poor and homeless people, giving away all his possessions in acts of random kindness. These efforts utterly failed, and he came to believe that he was being followed by the hound of heaven. He finally revealed, in his suicide note, that these acts of altruism brought more harm than good to the lives of homeless people. Richard Dawkins later took Hamilton and Price's equations and popularised them, explaining that humans are simply machines created by the selfish genes. Curtis likens this to \\"\\"reinventing the immortal soul,\\" but as computer code in the form of the genes. President Mobutu In 1994, the ruling Hutu government set out to eradicate the Tutsi minority. This was explained as incomprehensible ancient rivalry by the Western press. In reality it was due to the Belgian myth created during the colonial rule. Western agencies got involved, and the Tutsi fought back, creating chaos. Many flooded across the border into Zaire, and the Tutsi invaded the refugee camps to get revenge. Mobutu fell from power. Troops arrived from many countries, allegedly to help, but in reality to gain access to the country's natural resources, used to produce consumer goods for the West. Altogether, 4.5 million people were killed. By this point Hamilton was well-honoured. However, by now he supported eugenics and believed that the help provided to the ill and disabled by modern medicine was counter to the logic of genes. He heard a story that HIV had been created from an accident with a polio vaccine, which it was thought could have been contaminated with a chimp virus. This supported his idea that modern medicine could have negative consequences. Hamilton travelled to Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo while the Second Congo War was raging. He went there to collect Chimpanzee faeces to test his theory that HIV was due to a medical mistake. While there he caught malaria, for which he took aspirin, which lodged in his gut, causing a haemorrhage which killed him. His hypothesis about the creation of AIDS would ultimately be entirely debunked. Curtis ends the episode by saying that Hamilton's ideas that humans are computers controlled by the genes have become accepted wisdom. But he asks whether we have accepted a fatalistic philosophy that humans are helpless computers to explain and excuse the fact that, as in the Congo, we are effectively unable to improve and change the world. =Contributors= * Prof. Michael Ruse, friend of Bill Hamilton * Kathleen Price, George Price's daughter * Edward Teller (archive) * James Schwartz, George Price's biographer * Bill Hamilton (interviewed 1999) Interviews and reviews In May 2011, Adam Curtis was interviewed about the series by Katharine Viner in The Guardian, by the Register and by Little Atoms.

Background Similar to 1970 by election, as part of the People's Action Party continuous initiative to renew its ranks, the PAP had invited six instead of five veteran PAP Ministers and Members of Parliament (MPs) to resign. Also, with the demise of Anson's MP P. Govindaswamy, the 1979 by-election is regarded as the biggest-ever by-election in Singapore's history where there are seven seats namely Anson, Geylang West, Mountbatten, Nee Soon, Potong Pasir, Sembawang and Telok Blangah up for grabs. This by-election also sees the introduction of two prominent candidates: the first was Tony Tan Keng Yam, who would be assumed the role of the Cabinet Minister after the by- election victory in Sembawang, and later went on to become the 7th Deputy Prime Minister from 1995, and the 7th President of Singapore from 2011; the second was Chiam See Tong, who made his debut on Potong Pasir would later be elected for that area on his third attempt in the 1984 General elections with his second attempt made on the next year's general election. Since this is the biggest ever by election in Singapore's history, therefore key opposition stalwarts emerged to contest with the exception of Barisan Sosialis which was then criticised by United People's Front (Singapore) and left the only two constituencies out of seven, namely Nee Soon and Geylang West to be uncontested.

He grew up in Tennessee and attended the University of Kentucky, where he played basketball, track, golf, and football. After four years in the U.S. Army during World War II, Allen was drafted in 1947 by the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL). He instead went to play for the Cleveland Browns of the competing All- America Football Conference, who won the league championship that year. Allen played in Cleveland for one season, returning to the University of Kentucky in 1948 to serve as an assistant football coach under Bear Bryant. He stayed at Kentucky after Blanton Collier took over as head coach in 1954, working as the team's defensive coordinator. In 1962, Tom Landry hired him as a backfield coach on the NFL's Dallas Cowboys. He became the head of the Cowboys' research and development department in 1970 and was charged with scouting opponents. The Cowboys won Super Bowl VI in 1972. Allen remained with the team until retiring in 1983. He died of cancer in 1998 in a Dallas hospital. Early life and college Allen grew up in Morristown, Tennessee and was a star athlete at Morristown High School. He attended the University of Kentucky, where he played football, basketball, track and golf. He was on the varsity football team between 1939 and 1941, playing as a tailback under head coach A. D. Kirwan. The team finished with winning records in each of the seasons Allen played, but was not ranked in the AP Poll of the best college teams in the country. Allen was a triple threat man, handling passing, running and kicking duties for Kentucky. Allen was a member of a Kentucky golf team that lost only one match in 1940 and went undefeated in 1941 and 1942. He played varsity basketball between 1940 and 1942, earning a spot on the Southeastern Conference all-star team in his final year. Allen's college career was interrupted by service in the U.S. Army during World War II. He enlisted in 1942 and spent four years in the Army, rising to the rank of major. Allen returned to the University of Kentucky to finish his education and play a final year of football. A controversy developed, however, over his eligibility to play in 1946 because he had already played three varsity seasons before enlisting. Southeastern Conference commissioner Mike Conner ruled him ineligible in September, shortly after he had been certified to play based on a rule that gave four years of varsity eligibility to men who served in the war. Several days later, he was again ruled eligible by the conference's executive committee. Kentucky head coach Bear Bryant said he was \\"delighted\\" with the decision. After quarterbacking Kentucky to victories over the University of Mississippi and University of Cincinnati, the conference reversed its decision and declared him ineligible. He spent the rest of the year coaching backs under Bryant. Professional football career Allen was drafted by the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) in 1947 but instead joined the Cleveland Browns of the competing All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He competed to be a backup for starting quarterback Otto Graham in the team's T formation offense. Allen struggled to learn Cleveland's formations, which differed significantly from the single-wing formation his Kentucky teams used. Allen had four interceptions in limited playing time for Cleveland as the team finished the season with the 12‚Äì1‚Äì1 record and beat the New York Yankees in the championship game. Coaching career Allen returned to the University of Kentucky in 1948 and was named the football team's offensive coordinator under Bryant. Blanton Collier, who had been a backfield coach for the Browns, succeeded Bryant as Kentucky head coach in 1954. Collier kept Allen on his staff but switched him to defensive coordinator. Allen remained an avid golfer as he continued his coaching career, winning the Kentucky Amateur Golf Championship in 1955 and 1958. He came in second place in the tournament in 1956 and tied for first place in a tri-state championship. Allen left Kentucky in 1962 to become a backfield coach for the NFL's Dallas Cowboys under head coach Tom Landry. In 1970, he became a special assistant to Landry and headed the Cowboys' research and development department. In that role, he was responsible for scouting all of the Cowboys' opponents. The Cowboys won Super Bowl VI in 1972 while Allen was with the team. Allen suffered a heart attack before the 1973 season, but remained with the team until 1983. Death Allen died of cancer in 1988 at the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. \\"He was a tremendous coach, as well as a real bright type of guy who had a statistical mind,\\" Landry said after his death. \\"He could keep up with anything.\\" Landry also praised his sense of humor. Eugene Meeks, who played college football with Allen, said he was one of Kentucky's best-ever athletes and a dominant golf player during his time at the university.

It is located in Piazza Mercanti, former city centre in the Middle Ages. The construction of the palace began in 1562 on a design by architect Vincenzo Seregni. The palace replaced an older one (dating back to the 13th century), which was demolished. The overall style of the building and its decoration is Manneristic. A pre-existing tower by Napo Torriani was preserved and adapted to the new architecture as a bell tower; the bell, which was nicknamed \\"Zavataria\\" after Zavatario della Strada who donated it, rang to announce such events as public executions.Guida ai segreti e misteri di Milano (SugarCo 1977), p. 276 The bell was later replaced by a clock. The building originally served as the seat of the Collegio dei Nobili Dottori (\\"College of the Noble Doctors\\"), a school for aspiring politicians and lawyers. After the 18th century it was used for other functions, including as a stock exchange, as the seat of the telegraph company, as the seat of the Popolare di Milano bank, and finally as the seat of the Chamber of Commerce (from 1911). Today, the building is still the property of the Chamber of Commerce. The palace was severely damaged by the bombings of World War II but was thoroughly restored in the 1980s by Gianni Mezzanotte. During this restoration, the palace was enhanced with hi-tech equipment, such as modern communication lines and multimedia appliances, to create a prestigious multi-functional venue to accommodate events, conferences, and such. It was at this time that the new denomination of \\"Palazzo Affari\\" was adopted, although the Palace is still largely known by its former name.

Since the organizations' creation in 1971, the Spectrum Center's mission statement has been to \\"enrich the campus experience and develop students as individuals and as members of the LGBTQA community.\\" The organization achieves this through student-centered education, outreach, advocacy and support. History Initially, on March 17, 1970, following the creation of the Detroit Gay Liberation Movement a few weeks earlier, both students and members of the larger community came together to initiate the University of Michigan chapter of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF), seeking to battle stereotypes of gay people, fighting homophobic prejudice, and invalidating the mental illness model of homosexuality. After increased pressure from both the GLF and Michigan students, the University established a one-room office in September 1971, provided funding for 2 quarter-time positions to be filled by a lesbian and gay male and a small budget, to deal with gay and lesbian issues on campus. Jim Toy and Cindy Gair, a leader of the Radical Lesbians an offshoot of GLF, were hired to fill the available positions, titled Human Sexuality Advocates, at the University of Michigan's \\"Human Sexuality Office\\" (HSO). This achievement was monumental, in that it was officially the first staff office for queer students in an institution of higher learning in the United States. Following the establishment of the office, Jim and Cindy set up a system of peer-advisors to speak with the counseling office and aid in training them how to best counsel lesbian and gay individuals. By early 1973, the office had formed its first Speakers' Bureau, which consisted of gay and lesbian students and members from the community, and worked with other student groups, in order to educate students concerning gay and lesbian issues. By 1972, the office had made one class presentation; today the Spectrum Center provides eighty or more workshops to classes and seminars each year. In January 1977, the advocacy positions were upgraded to half-time positions and then again in 1987, when they received full-time appointments; both changes were primarily the result of advocacy for the office by students, staff, faculty, and religious leaders from the campus and Ann Arbor communities. During the 1980s, the University of Michigan administration finally agreed to allow identity terms in the office name and the Office of Human Sexuality became the University of Michigan \\"Lesbian & Gay Male Programs Office\\". In addition, the 1980s brought about increased outreach and services to bisexual people and people of color in support of their concerns. In 1994, the University administration reduced the two positions to one position, with positions for support staff being added over the years. During this time, Jim Toy stepped down and Ronnie Sanlo was hired as Interim Director. Within a month, Ronnie conducted a CAS assessment for the office. As a vision for the office was being developed, the office added bisexuality to the title to acknowledge inclusion of more sexual minorities at the University, thus becoming the \\"Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual Programs Office\\". In 1995, the office began to learn more about transgender issues and began to include these issues in office education programs. In addition, the office expanded the speakers bureau to include allies, founded Lavender Graduation, and expanded the title of the office to include transgender individuals, becoming the \\"UM Office of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Affairs\\". In 1997, the central goals for the office were to increase transgender inclusion and education concerning transgender issues, increase education on campus in general, making the education coordinator position a full-time job and increased inclusion for students of color. During that period of time Frederic MacDonald-Dennis held the Interim Director position and continued the development and expansion of various programs.40th Anniversary Logo (2011) Thanks to MacDonald's work, the University created a gender-identity working group that focused on gaps in services for transgender individuals, made recommendations for inclusion, and began to examine the current climate on campus for TBLG people. In addition, Transforum was established by students as a group for alumni, students, & faculty of the University of Michigan that provides discussion, support, and resources and is committed to advancing the equal rights, health care access, and safety of transgender people. During this time, there was an increase in the number of participants, speaking engagements and training in the speakers bureau, as well as the development of Color Splash, an event for LGBT people of color and a Coming Out Group. In 2005, the office developed the Ally Training Program, which educates people how to be better allies to the LGBT community. In the fall of that year, Jackie Simpson took over as office Director and began the process to change the office's name to a more inclusive name: the \\"Spectrum Center\\". In 2011, the Spectrum Center celebrated this important milestone in its history. In February, the University of Michigan hosted the annual MBLGTACC conference- the largest queer college conference in the country. And in November, the Spectrum Center hosted an \\"alumni weekend\\", in which past and present students and friends of the Spectrum Center gathered together to celebrate the past and plan for the future. In recent years, the office has collaborated with University Housing to help them develop a gender- neutral housing policy. In addition, the office is supporting efforts by students for increased inclusion of gender-identity and an amendment to include \\"gender identity\\" and \\"gender expression\\" in the University bylaws. The office continues to focus on concerns for civil rights, addressing concerns and the inclusion of students on campus and looks forward to continued progress and transformation of the office towards the betterment of the LGBT student's college and life experience. Programs=Education & Training In March 2005, the University of Michigan joined more than 140 other colleges and universities by implementing an Ally Training Program through the Spectrum Center. Ally Program participants attend a one-day, six- hour training designed to strengthen their ability to serve as allies to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students, staff, and faculty at the University of Michigan. Spectrum also has a Speakers Bureau program where speakers share their experiences and growth, thereby promoting knowledge, compassion, and understanding about LGBTQ identities, issues and concerns. Support Spectrum Center runs two coming out programs: GPS, and closed coming out groups. The GPS Program provides students with Guidance to helpful information and resources, Perspective of a fellow student who has experience with coming out, and Support for coming out. Coming out groups are closed and confidential ten-week discussion and support groups which help participants explore a variety of coming-out issues. Spectrum also offers three support groups relating to gender identity: Partners of transfolk, Gender Explorers, and Mgender. Outreach Spectrum Center holds many events throughout the year to celebrate and recognize National Coming Out Day, Transgender Day of Remembrance, Celebrate Bisexuality Day, and Pride week. Spectrum also organizes an annual \\"Lavender Graduation\\" which recognizes queer and allied graduates of the University of Michigan.

As a member of the Conservative Party, he represented the riding of Brampton‚ÄîSpringdale in Ontario in the House of Commons of Canada from 2011 to 2015, holding roles as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs and the Minister of International Trade from 2013 until his defeat in the 2015 federal election. He was elected to the provincial legislature, representing Milton for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, in the 2018 provincial election. Early life Gill was born on May 17, 1974, in Moga, Punjab in India. He moved to Canada at a young age. Before politics, he was an entrepreneur and business executive. He worked on his family's businesses, which include a furniture manufacturing factory and some restaurants that he ran with his older brother. Political career According to Gill, he had become involved in federal politics because the thought of Canada legalizing same-sex marriage \\"pushed him over the edge.\\" In the 2006 federal election, Gill ran in York West, and lost to Liberal MP Judy Sgro by over 15000 votes. In the 2008 federal election, Gill ran in Brampton‚ÄîSpringdale against incumbent Ruby Dhalla, but was narrowly defeated by 773 votes. The election campaign between the two were heated, and during an all-candidates' debate, Dhalla brought up how Gill's brother had been charged with vandalizing her campaign signs in 2006, even though the charges were dropped, and Gill attacked Dhalla for failing to do enough for a boy beaten by police in India after stealing her aide's purse. He was elected as a Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament representing Brampton Springdale in the 2011 election, defeating Dhalla. In October 2011, Gill gave a rare mention of the Indian sport of kabaddi in a member's statement supporting the Canadian men's team participating in the upcoming World's Cup in India. Gill and fellow Conservative MP Tim Uppal would later watch the Canadian men upset the Pakistani team in the semifinals. After witnessing increased gang activity in his riding, Gill toured Western Canadian cities in December 2011 to speak with police and community organizations to see how this could be stopped. In May 2012, Gill introduced a private members bill, C-394, which made it a crime to target someone for recruitment into a gang. It was eventually passed into law in June 2014. In September 2013, Gill was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs. During Rob Ford's drug scandal, Gill was one of the few federal politicians to offer support for the embattled mayor, calling him a \\"great mayor\\" who was \\"doing a wonderful job\\" in November 2013, and claimed that Torontonians were happy with his record. In January 2015, Gill was appointed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to the role of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade. In May 2015, Gill wrote letters of support to the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for two of his constituents' competing applications for a community radio station in Brampton. The Conflict of Interest Act bars parliamentary secretaries from writing such letters to the CRTC and other administrative tribunals, and in October 2013, ethics commissioner Mary Dawson had issued a directive to that effect. The Ethics Commissioner ruled in February 2016 that although he had acted in good faith, Gill had violated the Conflict of Interest Act. 2015 election Redistribution of federal ridings took place and concluded shortly before the 2015 federal election. Gill's riding, Brampton-Springdale, was eliminated, and he ran in the new riding of Brampton North. In August 2015, the Huffington Post reported that a supporter of Gill's who previously bundled donations to Liberal MP Jim Karygiannis, had switched his allegiance and had induced Liberal supporters into donating to Gill without their consent. In October 2015, a week and a half before voting day, it was reported that the commissioner of Elections Canada launched an investigation into these claims. During the election, Gill criticized the provincial Ontario Liberal Party and Premier Kathleen Wynne's proposed updates to the sexual education curriculum, which had not been changed since 1998. The changes included teaching that homosexuality was acceptable in Grade 3, teaching about puberty in Grade 4 as opposed to Grade 5, and teaching about masturbation and gender expression in Grade 6. Gill described the changes as \\"graphic and explicit\\" in a taxpayer- funded mailout which conflated the provincial party's education policies with those of separate federal Liberal party, which has no constitutional jurisdiction in the field. In the mailout, Gill also said that it was part of a Liberal attack on family values and parent's right to control the education of their children. In a 2015 video with the Punjabi Post, Gill described some segments of the new education curriculum as \\"disgusting.\\" Gill lost to Liberal candidate Ruby Sahota. Provincial politics On October 29, 2016, Gill announced that he would seek the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario nomination in Milton for the 42nd Ontario general election.https://www.facebook.com/MPParmGill/posts/1162254647223769 On June 18, 2017, he won the nomination. In June 2017, then Progressive Conservative leader Patrick Brown said that Gill's position on gay rights had shifted, and he was now \\"100 per cent\\" in favour of gay rights. On June 7, 2018 Gill won the Ontario general election in the riding of Milton as a member of the Progressive Conservatives. Personal life Gill lives in Milton with his wife Amarpal, with whom he has two sons, Daman and Raman, and a daughter, Parmeet.

The College offers a range of degrees at both graduate and post-graduate level. History The Northeastern College was founded as the Northeastern Institute, in 1941, initially as a high school. It was the first secondary school in the province, and after the first three years, expanded into offering an undergraduate college education. The Northeastern Institute, now the Northeastern College was founded in 1941 by educationally-minded citizens, Atty. Francisco E. Pascual, his wife, Do√±a Emeteria Bautista Pascual, and Mr. Leon Cadaoas who were all residents of Santiago, Isabela. The Institute, the first to offer secondary education in the province, originally started with first and second year levels with Do√≤a Emeteria B. Pascual serving as the classroom teacher and principal in one. When World War II broke out in December 1941, its operation was temporarily cut short. Four years later, (August 1945) the school, housed in a rented building Barangay Dubinan resumed its operation this time offering complete secondary education. From 1945 to 1948, enrolment considerably increased prompting the Board of trustees to approve the construction of a two-storey building on the site where today it presently stands. Inspired with the three years of successful operation, the members of the Board of Trustees conceived the opening of a tertiary education to cater higher educational needs of its high school graduates. This marked the birth of its college department offering initially the courses Bachelor of Science in Education, Commerce and General Associate in Arts with Mr. Vicente P. Salvador as the first college dean. The opening of the normal course necessitated the opening of a complete elementary education which served as the training ground of its teacher trainees. On April 25, 1949, the first commencement exercises of the Normal Department of the college was held followed by another one on December 17, 1949. The following years ear-marked not only progress in terms of enrolment but also in education output where most of it graduates find themselves in gainful employment after graduation. The efficient management of the college coupled with effective instruction was the college's greatest investment made in past five decades that more college courses were clamored for by the community. Today, in response to this clamor, the college now offers fifteen (15) undergraduate courses including the newly offered Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Midwifery Education, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering, Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communication, five post graduate studies and six computer short-term courses. From its humble beginning, NC now stands as one of the formidable educational institutions in the valley as attested by the constant increase in enrolment, regular faculty development, continuous improvement of its educational facilities and its active involvement in the community.

History Kierkegaard published his Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses throughout the years 1843 and 1844. He followed the Socratic Method by publishing his own view of life under his own name and different views of life under pseudonyms. His own view was that of \\"a committed Christian trained for the ministry.\\"Historical Dictionary of Kierkegaard's Philosophy, Julia Watkin, Scarecrow Press, 2001 p. 6 He published three books on the same day in 1843 and now, in 1844, he will publish four books in the month of June: Three Upbuilding Discourses, June 8, Philosophical Fragments, June 13, Prefaces, and The Concept of Anxiety, June 17. He had a plan in mind as he published these works. Kierkegaard says, \\"all who are expecting do have one thing in common, that they are expecting something in the future, because expectancy and the future are inseparable ideas.\\"Eighteen Upbuilding Discouses, Hong p. 16 But many people live in \\"conflict with the future\\"Eighteen Upbuilding Discouses, Hong p. 255 Yet, \\"by the eternal, one can conquer the future, because the eternal is the ground of the future, and therefore through it the future can be fathomed. What, then, is the eternal power in a human being? It is faith. What is the expectancy of faith? Victory-or, as Scripture so earnestly and so movingly teaches us, that all things must serve for good those who love God.\\"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 19 Kierkegaard writes about expectancy once more in these discourses. Expectancy has to do with hope. \\"The healthy individual lives simultaneously in hope and in recollection, and only thereby does his life gain true and substantive continuity. Thus he has hope and therefore does not wish to go backward in time, as do those who live only in recollection. What, then, does recollection do for him, for it certainly must have some influence? It places a sharp on the note of the moment; the further back it goes, the more often the repetition, the more sharps there are. For example, if in the present year he experiences an erotic moment, this is augmented by his recollection of it in the previous year etc. ‚Ä¶ Hope hovers over it as a hope of eternity that fills out the moment.Either/Or II p. 142-143 Kierkegaard writes about remembering one's Creator, hoping, being concerned about one's eternal salvation, and knowing one's place in the world in these discourses.  Structure  His three discourses are dedicated \\"To the late Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard formerly a clothing merchant here in the city My Father\\". All but one of his Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses were dedicated to his father. He also includes a dedication: \\"to that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader\\". Regine Olsen is \\"my reader\\" according to some scholars.A Short Life of Kierkegaard, by Walter Lowrie, Princeton University Press, 1942, 1970 p. 150ff, Soren Kierkegaard, A Biography, by Johannes Hohlenberg, Translated by T.H. Croxall, Pantheon Books 1954 p. 115-116, Eighteen upbuilding discourses by S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Robert L. Perkins p. 15ff Here is his dedication for these discourses. His discourses; * Think about Your Creator in the Days of Your Youth * The Expectancy of an Eternal Salvation * He Must Increase; I Must Decrease Think about Your Creator in the Days of Your Youth Based on the following text; \\"REMEMBER ALSO your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when you will say, \\"I have no pleasure in them\\"\\" Ecclesiastes 12:1 RSV, The Bible This discourse begins with the question of truth. He identifies two kinds of truth, one which is indifferent to the single individual because it pertains to all human beings equally. He says, > \\"There is a truth, the greatness and the grandeur of which we are accustomed > to praise by saying admiringly that it is indifferent, equally valid, > whether anyone accepts it or not; indifferent to the individual's particular > condition, whether he is young or old, happy or dejected; indifferent to its > relation to him, whether it benefits him or harms him, whether it keeps him > from something or assists him to it; equally valid whether he totally > subscribes to it or coldly and impassively professes it, whether he gives > his life for it or uses it for ill gain; indifferent to whether he has found > it himself or merely repeats what has been taught.\\"Eighteen Upbuilding > Discourses, Hong 1990 p. 233 see also Either/Or II p. 174-175 Hong 1987 Fear > and Trembling, Hong 1983 27-29 Creation of man Prometheus Berthelemy Then he writes of another kind of truth. > There is another kind of truth or, if this is humbler, another kind of > truths that could be called concerned truths.

Such a concerned truth is not independent of the one who has > propounded it; on the contrary, he remains present in it continually in > order in turn to concern himself about the single individual. Eighteen > Upbuilding Discourses, p. 233-234 Kierkegaard says the text from Ecclesiastes should \\"awaken you to concern about yourself.\\" \\"The thought of the Creator is youth's most beautiful splendor\\" and the Preacher \\"is not just saying that you can think about your Creator, but he admonishes you to do it; and if you are young, whether you are joyful or dejected; whether you are carefree or discouraged, whoever you are, it is nevertheless to you, precisely to you, that he is speaking, you to whom the admonition applies ...Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 234, 238 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, 1832 The existence of God has been debated throughout time. Both Hegel and Schelling attended the University of T√ºbingen, the school was interested in using higher criticism of Biblical texts to determine the truth of the claims of Christianity. Hegel wrote the following in 1832, He says religion has always stopped the philosophers and scientists from gaining knowledge because the Christian religion is opposed to any knowledge that differs from Biblical knowledge. Hedgel is indifferent to what the Bible says. He writes in his Philosophy of Religion > If at the present day philosophy be an object of enmity because it occupies > itself with religion, this cannot really surprise us when we consider the > general character of the time. Every one who attempts to take to do with the > knowledge of God, and by the aid of thought to comprehend His nature, must > be prepared to find, that either no attention will be paid to him, or that > people will turn against him and combine to oppose him. The more the > knowledge of finite things has increased and the increase is so great that > the extension of the sciences has become almost boundless, and all regions > of knowledge are enlarged to an extent which makes a comprehensive view > impossible so much the more has the sphere of the knowledge of God become > contracted. There was a time when all knowledge was knowledge of God. Our > own time, on the contrary, has the distinction of knowing about all and > everything, about an infinite number of subjects, but nothing at all of God. > Formerly the mind found its supreme interest in knowing God, and searching > into His nature. It had and it found no rest unless in thus occupying itself > with God. When it could not satisfy this need it felt unhappy. The spiritual > conflicts to which the knowledge of God gives rise in the inner life were > the highest which the spirit knew and experienced in itself, and all other > interests and knowledge were lightly esteemed. Our own time has put this > need, with all its toils and conflicts, to silence; we have done with all > this, and got rid of it. What Tacitus said of the ancient Germans, that they > were securi adversus deos,Here is what Tacitus said, > http://www.romansonline.com/Src_Frame.asp?DocID=Ger_Bk01_46&Lat;=L we have > once more become in regard to knowledge, securi adversus deum.Secure against > the designs of god, (editor) > It no longer gives our age any concern that it knows nothing of God; on the > contrary, it is regarded as a mark of the highest intelligence to hold that > such knowledge is not even possible. What is laid down by the Christian > religion as the supreme, absolute commandment, \\"Ye shall know God,\\" is > regarded as a piece of folly. Christ says, \\"Be ye perfect, as My Father in > heaven is perfect.\\"Matthew 5:48 This lofty demand is to the wisdom of our > time an empty sound. It has made of God an infinite phantom, which is far > from us, and in like manner has made human knowledge a futile phantom of > finiteness, or a mirror upon which fall only shadows, only phenomena. How, > then, are we any longer to respect the commandment, and grasp its meaning, > when it says to us, \\" Be ye perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect,\\" > since we know nothing of the Perfect One, and since our knowing and willing > are confined solely and entirely to appearance, and the truth is to be and > to remain absolutely and exclusively a something beyond the present? And > what, we must further ask, what else would it be worth while to comprehend, > if God is incomprehensible? P. 35-36 Kierkegaard addressed this idea of proving God in this discourse. He says, \\"When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit and wait for the decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence with the help of a few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!\\"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 242-243 He also said, \\"Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to assume that you understand that there is a God is not so vain as to think that he has invented the existence of God.Soren Kierkegaard, Papers and Journals V B 194 n.d. 1844 He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote: > it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember > that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three > years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at > sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward > for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its > glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon > the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it > is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast ‚Äî I am crossing the > Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce > it. I will not lament the past ‚Äî why lament?

Journals of Kierkegaard, IA > August 1, 1835The quote is from here: > http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/I_A.html This idea of separating the Creator and youth's thought about the Creator is harmful. He says, \\"with the years came understanding, and with understanding knowledge, and with knowledge grief,-and with increased knowledge increased grief. But as he was developed and educated in this way, the simple became more difficult for him, and since with out this guidance he wanted to rule himself, everything became more and more complicated. ‚Äì Perhaps he chose the guidance of thought, and in order not to owe anyone anything he let this seed sow itself and let one thought evolve out of another, until eventually the infinite manifested itself to him and made him dizzy. The more he stared fixedly at it, the more his eye lost the visual power to find the way back to finitude.-Perhaps desire blinded him, life seemed like a joke to him, and he let God grieve in heaven while he chose pleasure and let enthusiasm speak in vain about conflict and struggle, about courage in dangers, patience in tribulation, love in life, victory in death, reward in heaven, while he let every day have its pleasure.-Perhaps a worldly-minded worry about food and clothing scattered his mind so that he did neither the one nor the other.\\" Kierkegaard's remedy for this individual is to find a place to be alone with God. He says, \\"Just as the first book in the Old Testament has been called Genesis, the second Exodus, so it could very well be said that in human life there is a third book called Retreat.\\"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 247-248 He continues, \\"We are speaking only of the beautiful meaning of the retreat for human life and of how having thought about the Creator in one's youth is the retreat's rescuing angel. Let a person's work take from him what belongs to it, his time, his diligence, but in the advancing years, O God, preserve a recollection of youth that preserves youth's thought of the Creator. Woe to him who separates what God has joined together, who to him who separates adulthood from its youth.Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 249-250 The Expectancy of an Eternal Salvation based on this text; \\"For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, because we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.\\" 2 Corinthians 4.17-18 \\"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.\\" The Bible (KJV) Kierkegaard moves the reader from the idea of the Creator to that of an eternal salvation. Is there such a thing as an eternal salvation? He says. > It may be a merit of our present age that in many ways it has known how to > work the wish weary and in that way to wean the soul from wishing; it may be > to its advantage if it thereby has developed an honest earnestness that for > the good renounces the fraudulence of wishes. We do not reproach the age for > having made the idea of the power of the wish into playing with words if it > thereby motivates someone to work with his own hands instead of with the > borrowed energy of the wish. But the wish for heaven's salvation-is this, > too, a play on words, as wishing for heavenly help has become for the > frivolous, who thinks that we ought to depend on God the way we depend on > people ‚Äìthat is, if you help yourself then God does the rest. And if the > wish for heaven's salvation has become playing with words, has the aim in it > been to incite people to work all the harder to gain it? This seems not at > all to be the case. Instead, eternal salvation seems to have become what the > thought of it has become, a loose and idle phrase, at times virtually > forgotten, or arbitrarily left out of the language, or indifferently set > aside as an old-fashioned turn of speech no longer used but retained only > because it is so quaint. And whereas in the old days one received heaven's > salvation by the grace of God, nowadays heaven's salvation often seems to > have become like an old, decrepit person who in the house of the mighty > sustains his life on the miserable bread of charity. Eighteen Upbuilding > Discourses, p. 254 Kierkegaard asks, where does the single individual turn if he wants to think about the expectancy of an eternal life? How does it work in civic affairs? Does a state official turn to \\"aliens and foreigners\\" or to \\"loafers and irresponsible tramps\\" or \\"robbers and agitators\\" to discuss the state of the nation? No, the official goes to someone who has a \\"concern\\" for the \\"welfare of the country.\\"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 254 The single individual doesn't go to someone who says \\"salvation is a matter or course\\" he goes to someone who knows \\"that no one can serve two masters, since he must hate the one and love the other\\" (Matthew 6:24), whose soul is fully awakened from sleep to understand what presumably would hurl the sleepwalker into the abyss, \\"that love of the world is hatred of God!\\" (James 4.4)Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 256, 258 Kierkegaard puts it this way, Pontius Pilate: What is truth? by Nikolaj Nikolajewitsch Ge, 1890 How can we find out of the single individual is ready for eternal salvation? Kierkegaard says, \\"Any army sometimes has a select little group called the immortal battalion, and a warrior esteems it a great honor to be accepted into it. Let us suppose that there was a man who was just as concerned about being in that battalion as everyone ought to be concerned about being an heir of heaven's salvation. The conditions were sufficiently known; distinction in battle was required, but also a certain appearance, a specific height, physique, etc. He would then examine himself to see whether he filled all the requirements, not in general, not casually, because he would be too concerned for that, and he knew that if he was deficient in merely the slightest way he would not be accepted. And whether anything was lacking or everything was present in the right proportion the commander would decide in his appraisal.Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 269 Can we talk about the Christian in the same way? No. Kierkegaard says, \\"every person has heaven's salvation, only by the grace and mercy of God, and this is equally close to every human being in the sense that it is a matter between God and him; and let no third person,Philosophical Fragments, Swensen p. 76, Repetition 202-203, Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses p. 168, The Concept of Anxiety p. 85, The Concept of Anxiety p. 96-97 himself having been restored to grace, forfeit this by unwarranted interference. If there was a person who embittered my life early and late and thought nothing but the worst of me, would his also being saved be able to disturb my salvation?Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 270-271 Eternal salvation is equally close to everyone.See Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 1.3 Every Good Gift And Every Perfect Gift Is From Above There is no distinction between the simple and the wise. He says, \\"If one was not what in a more elevated way is called a simple man, but what in plain, everyday speech is called a real simpleton, and you, my listener, were a wise person who profoundly asked, \\"What is truth?\\" and restlessly pondered the question with competence and success-do you suppose it would disturb you if he became just as blessed as you and heaven's infinite salvation made you both equal?\\"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 271-272 Kierkegaard questions whether having arrived at a truth is better than the continual striving after truth. First a quotation from this discourse and then two similar quotations from Concluding Unscientific Postscript and then one from Practice in Christianity. He Must Increase; I Must Decrease the text; \\"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice; therefore this joy of mine is now full. He must increase, but I must decrease.\\" Gospel of John 3.29-30 Kierkegaard talks about the same things he's been talking about in all his writings, self-knowledge. He says, \\"Everyone else would presumably understand that self-knowledgeSee Philosophy of Soren Kierkegaard#Individuality is a difficult matter; although it is easy to understand the rest of the world, the understanding suddenly changes very substantially when it pertains to oneself.\\"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong, p. 275 He speaks of choosing oneself in Either/Or, \\"When a person considers himself esthetically his soul is like soil out of which grow all sorts of herbs, all with equal claim to flourish; his self consists of this multiplicity, and he has no self that is higher than this (...) Someone who views the personality ethically has at once an absolute difference: namely, the difference between good and evil. And if he finds more of evil in him than of good, this still does not mean that it is the evil that is to advance, but it means that it is the evil that is to recede and the good that is to advance. (...) It truly takes considerable ethical courage to acknowledge the good as the highest, because one thereby falls into altogether universal categories.\\"Either/Or Part II P. 225-226 And now the many to whom the Baptizer's exalted example is entirely applicable, although in unpretentiousness, he many who at an early age are given to understand humbly that for them the form of a servant is not something assumed, those who at and early age are prompted to bear in mind that for them there is someone who must increase while they decrease.Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong, p. 281 He uses another single individual, John the Baptist to talk about \\"the rising and setting of the sun.\\" He says, \\"all deeper and more inward self-knowledge sees the finger of God that points to him.\\"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong, p. 60-61, 275-276 John was \\"the voice crying in the wilderness\\", then the \\"morning star\\" came and his disciples were sad because people were going to him and John said, \\"He must increase; I must decrease.\\" John was willing to step aside because \\"he knew that the ceremony after which he was named would be abolished, would disappear as a baptism with water in contrast to a baptism with fire and the Holy Spirit.\\"When a common danger stands at everyone's door, when a common calamity teaches people to hold together and drums reconciliation into them, then it certainly is seen how they are reconciled in the understanding of the same things and how this reconciliation would benefit them jointly and would benefit the individual. But when the danger is over and the calamity has had its day, then there is all too quickly a relapse into the old ways of life, and the reconciliation coerced by the need sometimes carries within itself the seed of a deeper separation than the one that was eliminated. And even if that reconciliation casts an enhancing radiance over the period of the individual's lives, it nevertheless belongs essentially not to them but to the observation and the observer who inherits it, until the story about it is also forgotten. Even though it is beautiful to envision this, such a life is a life of temporality, is the fruit of temporality, but also the prey of temporality, and the most that can be said of it is that it was a beautiful moment.

If he himself does not at times evoke this thought, he is a hireling, an unfaithful servant, who is trying to free himself and to cheat the Lord of the uncertainty in which he comprehends his own nothingness. That much in life is empty and worthless, people certainly do know, but how frequently the single individual makes an exception, and even the highest mission in the spiritual world is only an errand, and one who is equipped for it with all spiritual-intellectual gifts is only on an errand...\\" He says, \\"John was the bridegroom's friend, who stands and hears his voice and rejoices greatly; but the least one in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John, because he does not stand outside listening to the bridegroom's voice.\\"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong, p. 287 Criticism Niels Treschow ~ 1751-1833 The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica had an article about Kierkegaard in their 1910 issue. \\"Kierkegaard, Soren Aaby (1813‚Äì1855) Danish philosopher, the seventh child of a Jutland hosier, was born in Copenhagen on the 5th of May 1813. As a boy he was delicate precocious and morbid in temperament. He studied theology at the university of Copenhagen, where he graduated in 1840 with a treatise On Irony. For two years he travelled in Germany, and in 1842 settled finally in Copenhagen, where he died on the 11th of November 1855. He had lived in studious retirement, subject to physical suffering and depression. His first volume, Papers of a Still Living Man (1838), a characterization of Hans Andersen, was a failure, and he was for some time unnoticed. In 1843 he published Euten-Eller (Either-or) (4th edition 1878), a work on which his reputation mainly rests; it is a discussion of the ethical and aesthetic ideas of life. In his last years he carried on a feverish agitation against the theology and practice of the state church, on the ground that religion is for the individual soul, and is to be separated absolutely from the state and the world. In general his philosophy was a reaction against the speculative thinkers-Steffens (q.v.), Niels Treschow (1751‚Äì1833) and Frederik Christian Sibbern (1785‚Äì1872); it was based on the absolute dualism of Faith and Knowledge. His chief follower was Rasmus Neilsen (1809‚Äì1884) and he was opposed by Georg Brandes, who wrote a brilliant account of his life and works. As a dialectician he has been described as little inferior to Plato, and his influence on the literature of Denmark is considerable both in style and in matter. To him Ibsen owed his character Brand in the drama of that name.\\"The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, 11th ed., Published 1910 by Encyclop√¶dia Britannica in New York. p. 788 https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri15chisrich#page/788/mode/1up Charles Darwin as an ape (1871) \\"Such works are mirrors: when an ape looks in, no apostle can look out.\\" Soren Kierkegaard quoting Lichtenberg, on the frontpage of Stages on Life's Way, 1845, Hong 1988 p. VI 14 \\"[Treschow's] favourite subject is a question, which is very well understood abroad, but not much considered here, Anthropology. His Elements of the Philosophy of History is a purely Anthropological Work. He calls himself Physical rather than Material. He disclaims the notions of Lamarck. Man has not been developed out of a Monad, but he has been developed out of some condition inferior to his present one. There was once a time when he could neither speak plainly, nor walk uprightly, just as certainly as there was once a time when he could neither read nor write. The primaeval state of man lay within certain limitations. It was never indefinitely low in the scale of Creation; inasmuch as Nature produces parallel types subject to parallel developments. Man grew out an Aquatic, or (I speak as a Quinarian) a Natatorial type. In the inferior stages of his organization he was, not a Monkey, but a Walrus. The history of the individual is the history of the species. The human kind in general, like the human being in particular, has its ages of childhood, youth, manhood, &c.; &c.; with their characteristic virtues and vices. The uterus is to the embryo as the tohu wabohu was to the world. Our nature proceeds gradually towards perfection.\\"Norway and the Norwegians, Volume 2 By Robert Gordon Latha Chapter XII Treschow ‚ÄîHis writings ‚Äî Anthropology ‚Äî Eilschow. p.149- 153 1840 p. 152-153 \\"Hegelianism promised to make absolute knowledge available by virtue of a science of logic. Anyone with the capacity to follow the dialectical progression of the purportedly transparent concepts of Hegel's logic would have access to the mind of God (which for Hegel was equivalent to the logical structure of the universe). Kierkegaard thought this to be the hubristic attempt to build a new tower of Babel, or a scala paradisi ‚Äî a dialectical ladder by which humans can climb with ease up to heaven. Kierkegaard's strategy was to invert this dialectic by seeking to make everything more difficult.See Concluding Postscript p. 241-251 Instead of seeing scientific knowledge as the means of human redemption, he regarded it as the greatest obstacle to redemption. Instead of seeking to give people more knowledge he sought to take away what passed for knowledge. Instead of seeking to make God and Christian faith perfectly intelligible he sought to emphasize the absolute transcendence by God of all human categories. Instead of setting himself up as a religious authority, Kierkegaard used a vast array of textual devices to undermine his authority as an author and to place responsibility for the existential significance to be derived from his texts squarely on the reader.\\" Sanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, S√∏ren Kierkegaard, First published Tue December 3, 1996; substantive revision Fri May 8, 2009 Kierkegaard had two visions, one in which everyone would hold together in temporality. He says, > When a common danger stands at everyone's door, when a common calamity > teaches people to hold together and drums reconciliation into them, then it > certainly is seen how they are reconciled in the understanding of the same > things and how this reconciliation would benefit them jointly and would > benefit the individual.

Eighteen Upbuilding > Discourses, p. 265-266 The existentialist, Albert Camus follows this line of thought with his book The Plague. He says finite concerns hold people together. He noted that a plague or other disaster would bring people together in a common concern. Camus and other writers, like Martin Heidegger believe common outer experiences hold people and nations together. Kierkegaard believes the inner expectations of Christians hold them together. Kierkegaard began his study of the inner and the outer with his first book, Either/Or. Kierkegaard says, \\"When life's demands exceed experience's understanding, then life is disordered and inconsolable, unless the expectancy of an eternal salvation orders and calms. (...) The expectancy of an eternal salvation will reconcile everyone with his neighbor, with his friend, and with his enemy in an understanding of the essential.\\"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 263-264, 265 Kierkegaard believed in just one commandment, Love thy neighbor as thyself.Either/Or Part II p. 255 NotesReferencesSources=Primary sources *Remember Now Thy Creator In the Days of Thy Youth Swenson translation *The Expectation of an Eternal Happiness Swenson translation * Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, by Soren Kierkegaard, Princeton University Press.

His works consists of paintings, monumental sculpture, monumental installations, conceptual architecture and new concepts on naval designhttp://www.coroflot.com/aguiladesign and computer art. Education Aguila studied visual and monumental art at the Higher Institute for Arts and Sciences in St Lucas, Brussels under such artists as Jos De Maegd and Maurits Van Saene. During the last year of his art education Aguila came to the conclusion that rather than focus on color, priority should be given to strong compositional elements and the contact the painting had with the environment, extending the composition of the work to the three-dimensional environment. Aguila discovered industrial design as a student of Professor Elno (1920‚Äì1998). He studied industrial design first at L'Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Arts Visuels de la Cambre in Brussels and then at Academy for Industrial Design in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. He later practiced industrial design in Germany. Early works Beginning in 1965, Aguila worked as an independent industrial designer for various European industries including Philips ‚Äì Telecom, Hilson, Bumaco, Brugman, Pirelli Brussels, Verbrughe (furniture), and Munar Antwerp, Belgium. For one of his package designs, Gielens was awarded the Howard Design Award. In the same period he also worked as the Industrial Design advisor at Febelhout, which is the Belgian Federation of Belgian, wood-using industries, Brussels (Belgium). In 1972, with Belgian architect, Bob Van Reeth, he designed his residence in Brussels, Belgium. In 1974, Aguila was invited to exhibit his paintings at the University of Ghent. The former conservator of the Museum for Modern Art in Brussels, Mrs. Phil Mertens, became interested in Aguila's painting, and recognized him as the leader of a new direction in contemporary art, coined, \\"Multidimensional Transparent Art\\". Aguila later was invited to work as a teacher and lecturer at Cool international school in Brussels 1977‚Äì1980, and from 1977‚Äì1999 at Universidad Las ColinasUniversidad Las Colinas in Elche, Spain, where he was time engaged full-time, teaching courses and giving conferences based on his knowledge of painting, conceptual architecture, and landscape art . The painting classes were soon being called \\"The School of Ilicitis\\", called after Ilice, the ancient name for Elche. Ilicitis means City of Light. The campus of the University was constructed by Gielens and his architecture students amongst the many palm trees, using very light structures and materials. Building and art design The social facet of this cultural artistic movement, is present all over and the aggregation of the multiple facets and disciplines gives birth to a living monumental work of art called \\"A Creation of the free will\\",‚ÄúA Creation of the free will‚Äù started 1977 and ongoing until at present. This monumental work of art is composed of multi disciplinary works of art, sculpture, installations, design, philosophy and architecture. In July 2001, Gielens was awarded the \\"Premio Juanito Laguna la trayectoria artistic\\" for the totality of his oeuvre by the Volpens-Stessens foundation in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Over 200 treaties were agreed upon by 1840. Gatlin argues that treaties established a procedure that benefited both parties. The federal government was primarily interested in guaranteeing that Indian lands did not fall into private hands, and that it handled all negotiations with the tribes. These negotiations, says Gatlin, strengthened the tribes sense of unity and leadership. The land sales gave the Indians a steady flow of income, and guarantees of federal financial, medical, and educational aid.Jay Gatlin, Private Diplomacy to Private Property: States, Tribes and Nations in the Early National Period,\\" Diplomatic History (1998) 22:1 pp 85-99 Many of the treaties remain in effect and are of special importance regarding federal recognition of tribal status, hunting and fishing rights, rights to protection of sacred properties, rights to water and minerals, and land claims.Alexandra Harmon, ed., The Power of Promises: Rethinking Indian Treaties in the Pacific Northwest (2008)Charles E. Cleland, Faith in Paper: The Ethnohistory and Litigation of Upper Great Lakes Indian Treaties (2011) excerpt and text search The federal courts have a long, continuous history of litigation on these issues.

History The commission of the work originated in 1480, when Perugino was decorating a chapel in the Old St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Pope Sixtus IV was pleased by his work, and decided to commission him also the decoration of the new Chapel he had built in the Vatican Palace. Due to the size of the work, Perugino was later joined by a group of painters from Florence, including Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and others. While the work was still being created, a visit from Alfonso II of Naples resulted in his addition to the far left of the group of foreground figures. To balance out the image, an apostle was added above St. Peter. Description Detail The scene, part of the series of the Stories of Jesus on the chapel's northern wall, is a reference to Matthew 16 in which Jesus says he will give \\"the keys of the kingdom of heaven\\" to Saint Peter. These keys represent the power to forgive and to share the word of God thereby giving them the power to allow others into heaven. The main figures are organized in a frieze in two tightly compressed rows close to the surface of the picture and well below the horizon.\\"Perugino\\". UXL Encyclopedia of World Biography, 2003. Retrieved on June 2, 2008. The principal group, showing Christ handing the silver and gold keys to the kneeling St. Peter, is surrounded by the other Apostles, including Judas (fifth figure to the left of Christ), all with halos, together with portraits of contemporaries, including one said to be a self-portrait (fifth from the right edge). The flat, open square is divided by coloured stones into large foreshortened rectangles. In the center of the background is a temple resembling the ideal church of Leon Battista Alberti's On architecture; on either side are triumphal arches with inscriptions aligning Sixtus VI to Solomon, recalling the latter's porticoed temple. Scattered in the middle distance are two scenes from the life of Christ, including the Tribute Money on the left and the stoning of Christ on the right. Detail of the central building The style of the figures is inspired by Andrea del Verrocchio. The active drapery, with its massive complexity, and the figures, particularly several apostles, including St. John the Evangelist, with beautiful features, long flowing hair, elegant demeanour, and refinement recall St Thomas from Verrocchio's bronze group in Orsanmichele. The poses of the actors fall into a small number of basic attitudes that are consistently repeated, usually in reverse from one side to the other, signifying the use of the same cartoon. They are graceful and elegant figures who tend to stand firmly on the earth. Their heads are smallish in proportion to the rest of their bodies, and their features are delicately distilled with considerable attention to minor detail. The octagonal temple of Jerusalem and its porches that dominates the central axis must have had behind it a project created by an architect, but Perugino's treatment is like the rendering of a wooden model, painted with exactitude. The building with its arches serves as a backdrop in front of which the action unfolds. Perugino has made a significant contribution in rendering the landscape. The sense of an infinite world that stretches across the horizon is stronger than in almost any other work of his contemporaries, and the feathery trees against the cloud-filled sky with the bluish-gray hills in the distance represent a solution that later painters would find instructive, especially Raphael. The building in the center is similar to that in Marriage of the Virgin by Perugino, as well as that painted by Perugino's pupil Pinturicchio in his Stories of St. Bernardino in the Bufalini Chapel of Santa Maria in Aracoeli. Legend The fresco was believed to be a good omen in Papal conclaves: superstition held that the cardinal who (as selected by lot) was housed in the cell beneath the fresco was likely to be elected. Contemporary records indicate at least three popes were housed beneath the fresco during the conclaves that elected them: Pope Clement VII, Pope Julius II, and Pope Paul III.Chambers, DS. 1978. \\"Papal Conclaves and Prophetic Mystery in the Sistine Chapel\\".

He was witness to and possibly played a part in a number of illegal activities during his life. He moved frequently in his early life from Missouri to California and to Arizona. Their father was implicated in the ambush and murder of a number of Mexican smugglers in July 1881. The following month he was killed by Mexican Rurales. Phin's brother Ike Clanton had an ongoing series of conflicts with Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp and was accused of cattle rustling among other things. Phin and his brothers developed bitter and angry feelings for the Earps. During the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881, Ike escaped unharmed but their brother Billy was killed. Ike and Phin were accused of attempting to murder Virgil in December and assassinating Morgan Earp two months later, but Cowboy friends vouched for their presence in Contention, away. Phin had numerous other brushes with the law during his life. He and his brother Ike moved to northern Arizona near their sister and her husband, Eben Stanley. The three men developed a reputation for stealing livestock. The grand jury indicted them and Ike was killed while resisting arrest. Phin served one year and five months of his 10-year prison term. He married late in life and four years later died after contracting pneumonia. Early life \\"Phin\\" or \\"Fin\\" was born in Callaway County, Missouri, to Newman Haynes Clanton and Mariah Sexton Kelso. Phin had six siblings: John Wesley, Joseph Issac, William Harrison, Alonzo Peter, Mary Elise and Ester Ann. The family moved frequently during his youth, from Missouri to Adams County, Illinois, in 1851 and then to Dallas, Texas, in 1853. The Clantons had repeated scrapes with the law. Both Newman and his oldest son John Wesley were convicted of desertion during the Civil War. They developed a reputation for theft and thuggery that followed them to Arizona. When Phin was 20, the family moved again to Fort Bowie, Arizona Territory and then the next year to San Buenaventura and after that to Port Hueneme, California. In 1869, at 24 years old, Phin was living in Lone Pine, California, with his oldest brother John Wesley Clanton and his wife Nancy. Four years later he returned to the Arizona Territory in 1873 to the Gila River valley to help his father Newman Haynes Clanton build up Clantonville, a farming community his father founded in Gila Valley, Arizona. His father purchased or squatted on a large tract of land outside Camp Thomas, but his plans for a new town failed to materialize. His father resumed cattle ranching and most of his children later followed him to Arizona. Ranching in Charleston In 1877, Phin moved with his father about south to land on the San Pedro River, about up river from Charleston, Arizona Territory. There he helped build a large adobe house which became the headquarters of the Clanton Ranch. Phin also obtained work as a freight driver. During the same time period, prospector Ed Schieffelin discovered silver in the hills east of the San Pedro River on a plateau known as Goose Flats, less than from the Clanton ranch. The family was very well situated to meet the demands for beef from the booming town of Tombstone. From its founding in March 1879, it grew from 100 residents to upwards of 15,000 citizens at its peak less than a decade later. When the mines built stamping mills on the San Pedro River about south of their ranch, a town named Charleston was built up to support them, providing the Clantons with another market for their beef. Phin's father was implicated in the First Skeleton Canyon Massacre in July 1881, and a month later \\"Old Man\\" Clanton was killed while driving a herd of stolen cattle through Guadalupe Canyon near the Mexican border. Old Man Clanton was buried where he died. In 1882 Phin and Ike exhumed their father's body and moved it to the Boot Hill cemetery in Tombstone. Newman Clanton was re-interred alongside his son Billy Clanton who had been killed in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Conflict with Earps Phin's brother Billy was killed during the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Deputy U.S. Marshal and Tombstone Police chief Virgil Earp, Assistant Marshal Morgan Earp, and temporary deputies Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, but they were exonerated after a contentious month-long preliminary hearing. Ike attempted to re-file murder charges in Contention, but his move was rejected for lack of new evidence. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and seriously wounded by hidden assailants. Virgil was left without use of his left arm. Phin and his brother Ike were both arrested for the attempted murder, but Cowboy friends bore witness that they had both been in Charleston, about away when the shooting took place, and they were released. Wyatt was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal in Virgil's place. Wyatt deputized several men who guarded Virgil and his wife Allie on their way to Tucson and a train ride back to Colton, California, and their parent's home where he could recuperate in safety. In Tucson, Wyatt spotted Frank Stilwell lying in wait near the railroad tracks and killed him. Pima County Sheriff Bob Paul issued a warrant for their arrest. When Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan received the warrant, he assembled his own posse composed of friends of Frank Stilwell and Ike Clanton, including Phin, Pete Spence, Johnny Ringo, Johnny Barnes and about 18 more men. They rode after the federal posse and the five men wanted for Stilwell's murder. The Cochise County posse tracked Wyatt Earp's Federal posse as it was looking for the Cowboys who had attacked his brothers, seeking vengeance, but the two posses never met during the two-week- long pursuit. Behan's posse almost caught up with the Earp posse on the morning of March 27 at the Sierra Bonita ranch of Henry C. Hooker, a wealthy and prominent rancher. When Behan's men were spotted in the distance, Hooker suggested Wyatt make his stand there, but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles distant near Reilly Hill. When Sheriff Behan and his posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita ranch, Hooker refused them assistance. One report said Hooker told Behan where to look for the Earps but the posse left in the opposite direction. Raises cattle and goats In June 1882 Phin moved north to Springerville, Apache County, where his sister Mary Elsie lived with her husband Eben Stanley, a recipient of the Medal of Honor while fighting with the 5th U.S. Cavalry under General George Crook. Ike Clanton arrived in August. By 1885, both brothers had bought a quarter-section of land () 10 miles east of Springerville near the New Mexico border. Eben assisted Phin and Ike in getting their cattle business started. Two years later, on December 27, 1885, the Apache County treasurer‚Äôs office was broken into. Deputy Treasurer Francisco Baca claimed that although the robbers were masked, he recognized the men as Phin and Ike Clanton, Eben Stanley and Lee Renfro of Springerville, and Mr. Buck Henderson of St. Johns. During the trial the court found that Baca had made up the story to cover his embezzling activities. He was later tried and convicted of stealing $11,166.54. Phin and Ike indicted Stanley and the two Clanton brothers were suspected of stealing cattle from the Springerville area and taking them south via the Blue River to Clifton, Arizona, and other southern towns to sell. The \\"Clanton-Stanley outfits\\" were regarded as rustlers and had been a \\"terror for years\\". Apache County Sheriff Perry Owens and the local Stock Association decided to pursue indictments against them. On March 1, 1887, George Powell testified before the grand jury implicating Ike, Phin, Eben, Charles Gray, Robert Gray, and Lee Renfro in livestock theft. An arrest warrant for Lee Renfro had already been issued on February 26 for the shooting death in November 1886 of Isaac Ellenger at Phin's Cienega Amarilla Ranch. Phin had allegedly given Renfro a horse to enable his escape. The grand jury returned 15 indictments the same day accusing Phin of grand larceny. Phin was arrested and jailed on April 30. During May more livestock were stolen and on May 14 deputies Albert Millet, George Powell and Detective Jonas V. Brighton left Springerville, Arizona to track down the stolen horses and mules. They followed the trail to \\"Peg-leg\\" Jim Wilson's ranch on Eagle Creek. They arrived on the evening of May 31 and spent the night. Early the next morning Ike Clanton rode up to the door on horseback. When the lawmen answered his knock, he immediately recognized them. He turned his horse to flee and withdrew his rifle from his scabbard. Detective Brighton shot Ike through the heart and he died before he hit the ground. On July 8 Renfro was found and was also killed while resisting arrest. In September 1887 Phin was found guilty and was sentenced to 10 years in the Yuma Arizona State Prison. While serving his sentence, it was discovered that the prosecution‚Äôs primary witness that led to Phin‚Äôs conviction had lied on the stand so he could collect the $250 reward. On March 15, 1889, after serving only one year and five months, he was pardoned by Governor Meyer Zulick and was released on March 24, 1889. After his release, Phin and his friend Pete Spence began raising Angora goats on what is now the Bohme Allotment on Phin‚Äôs ranch in Globe, Arizona. In 1891, a Clifton newspaper mistakenly reported that Phin had been shot and killed by Ballard Peason at St. John. On May 15, 1894, Phin Clanton was arrested by Sheriff John Henry Thompson for robbing Sam Kee, a Chinese gardener in Wheatfields, at gunpoint. Kee said Phin stole a gold watch valued at $40, two bars of silver bullion, each valued at $15, one gold bracelet valued at $20 and $320 in cash. Clanton was acquitted on May 22, 1894. On October 15, 1902, at age 58, Clanton married 44-year-old Laura Jane (n√©e Neal) Bound (or Bohme) in Globe, Arizona. She had a 12-year-old son from her first marriage to William Jackson. Accident and death On January 5, 1906, Phineas was involved in a wagon accident and developed a fatal case of pneumonia. He died at the age of 62 in Webster Springs and was buried in the Globe Cemetery. His widow Laura Jane did wash at the mining company's guest house and took in boarders. Sixteen-year-old Will found work for a freight company driving mule teams that hauled ore from the Continental Mine to the Old Dominion. The wagon tracks are still visible in the rocks west of the Bohme Ranch on Webster Gulch. Every payday, Will bought another cow. He and Jane ran cattle on the range subsequently designated the Bohme Allotment by the U.S. Forest Service. Four years later Laura married Phin‚Äôs friend and business associate Pete Spence.

Mead Citrus Flatid Planthopper, Metcalfa pruinosa (Say) (Insecta: Hemiptera: Flatidae) They are initially whitish. The color of adults may vary from brown to gray, in connection with the presence of a bluish white epicuticular wax, covering especially the nymphs. The large and prominent compound eyes are yellow. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking. The trapezoidal forewings are held vertically, wrapping the body when the insect is at rest. The front wings have veined costal cell and several characteristic whitish spots. The hind tibiae usually have two lateral spines in addition to the other spines at the apex. Nymphs may reach a length of about . Color varies from whitish to light green, with relative large tufts of white wax on the abdomen. Citrus flatid planthopper nymph Behavior and ecological impact The species is univoltine, producing one generation per year. Adults mate in fall during the night. The females lay about 100 eggs, usually in the bark of host plants. Eggs overwinter, hatching the following spring. The adults are seen mainly in summer and fall, when they feed gregariously on sap. When they feed on sap, they eject excess sugar in the form of honeydew. This attracts bees, which convert it to honey. As it feeds, it causes serious damages to field crops and ornamental plants. It is polyphagous, feeding on a variety of plant taxa. Host plants include maples, dogwoods, hawthorns, willows, elms, privet, black locust, and elder. It lives on crop plants such as grape, citrus, apricot, peach, blackberry, and raspberry.D. V.

Circular systems employ reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling to create a closed-loop system, minimising the use of resource inputs and the creation of waste, pollution and carbon emissions. The circular economy aims to keep products, equipment and infrastructure in use for longer, thus improving the productivity of these resources. All \\"waste\\" should become \\"food\\" for another process: either a by- product or recovered resource for another industrial process or as regenerative resources for nature (e.g., compost). This regenerative approach is in contrast to the traditional linear economy, which has a \\"take, make, dispose\\" model of production.  Sustainability  Intuitively, the circular economy would appear to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. Reducing the resources used, and the waste and leakage created, conserves resources and helps to reduce environmental pollution. However, it is argued by some that these assumptions are simplistic; that they disregard the complexity of existing systems and their potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the circular economy. There are cases that might require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy-efficient equipment. By reviewing the literature, a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft could show that there are at least eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy. In addition, it is important to underline the innovation aspect in the heart of sustained development based on circular economy components.Hysa, E.; Kruja, A.; Rehman, N.U.; Laurenti, R. Circular Economy Innovation and Environmental Sustainability Impact on Economic Growth: An Integrated Model for Sustainable Development. Sustainability 2020, 12, 4831., https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/12/4831 Scope The circular economy can cover a broad scope. Findings from the literature show that researchers have focused on different areas such as industrial applications with both product- oriented, natural resources and services, practice and policies to better understand the limitations that the CE currently faces, strategic management for details of the circular economy and different outcomes such as potential re-use applications and waste management. The circular economy includes products, infrastructure, equipment and services, and applies to every industry sector. It includes 'technical' resources (metals, minerals, fossil resources) and 'biological' resources (food, fibres, timber, etc.). Most schools of thought advocate a shift from fossil fuels to the use of renewable energy, and emphasize the role of diversity as a characteristic of resilient and sustainable systems. The circular economy includes discussion of the role of money and finance as part of the wider debate, and some of its pioneers have called for a revamp of economic performance measurement tools.. One study points out how modularisation could become a cornerstone to enable circular economy and enhance the sustainability of energy infrastructure. One example of a circular economy model is the implementation of renting models in traditional ownership areas (e.g. electronics, clothes, furniture, transportation). Through renting the same product to several clients, manufacturers can increase revenues per unit, thus decreasing the need to produce more to increase revenues. Recycling initiatives are often described as a circular economy and are likely to be the most widespread models. Background As early as 1966 Kenneth Boulding raised awareness of an \\"open economy\\" with unlimited input resources and output sinks, in contrast with a \\"closed economy\\", in which resources and sinks are tied and remain as long as possible a part of the economy. Boulding's essay \\"The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth\\" In H. Jarrett (ed.) Environmental Quality in a Growing Economy, Resources for the Future, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD, pp. 3-14. Retrieved 26 August 2018, or dieoff.org Retrieved 26 August 2018. is often cited as the first expression of the \\"circular economy\\", although Boulding does not use that phrase. The circular economy is grounded in the study of feedback-rich (non-linear) systems, particularly living systems. The contemporary understanding of the Circular Economy and its practical applications to economic systems evolved incorporating different features and contributions from a variety of concepts sharing the idea of closed loops. Some of the relevant theoretical influences are cradle to cradle, laws of ecology (e.g., ), looped and performance economy (Walter R. Stahel), regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry and blue economy. The circular economy was further modelled by British environmental economists David W. Pearce and R. Kerry Turner in 1989. In Economics of Natural Resources and the Environment, they pointed out that a traditional open-ended economy was developed with no built-in tendency to recycle, which was reflected by treating the environment as a waste reservoir. In the early 1990s, Tim Jackson began to pull together the scientific basis for this new approach to industrial production in his edited collection Clean Production Strategies, including chapters from pre-eminent writers in the field, such as Walter R Stahel, Bill Rees and Robert Constanza. At the time still called 'preventive environmental management', his follow-on book Material Concerns: Pollution, Profit and Quality of Life synthesised these findings into a manifesto for change, moving industrial production away from an extractive linear system towards a more circular economy. Emergence of the idea In their 1976 research report to the European Commission, \\"The Potential for Substituting Manpower for Energy\\", Walter Stahel and Genevieve Reday sketched the vision of an economy in loops (or circular economy) and its impact on job creation, economic competitiveness, resource savings and waste prevention. The report was published in 1982 as the book Jobs for Tomorrow: The Potential for Substituting Manpower for Energy. In 1982, Walter Stahel was awarded third prize in the Mitchell Prize competition on sustainable business models with a paper The Product-Life Factor. First prize went to the then US Secretary of Agriculture, second prize to Amory and Hunter Lovins, fourth prize to Peter Senge. Considered as one of the first pragmatic and credible sustainability think tanks, the main goals of Stahel's institute are to extend the working life of products, to make goods last longer, to re-use existing goods and ultimately to prevent waste. This model emphasizes the importance of selling services rather than products, an idea referred to as the \\"functional service economy\\" and sometimes put under the wider notion of \\"performance economy\\". This model also advocates \\"more localization of economic activity\\".Clift & Allwood, \\"Rethinking the economy\\", The Chemical Engineer, March 2011 Promoting a circular economy was identified as national policy in China's 11th five-year plan starting in 2006. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has more recently outlined the economic opportunity of a circular economy, bringing together complementary schools of thought in an attempt to create a coherent framework, thus giving the concept a wide exposure and appeal. Most frequently described as a framework for thinking, its supporters claim it is a coherent model that has value as part of a response to the end of the era of cheap oil and materials, moreover contributing to the transition for a low carbon economy. In line with this, a circular economy can contribute to meeting the COP 21 Paris Agreement. The emissions reduction commitments made by 195 countries at the COP 21 Paris Agreement, are not sufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 ¬∞C. To reach the 1.5 ¬∞C ambition it is estimated that additional emissions reductions of 15 billion tonnes CO2 per year need to be achieved by 2030. Circle Economy and Ecofys estimated that circular economy strategies may deliver emissions reductions that could basically bridge the gap by half. Moving away from the linear model Linear \\"take, make, dispose\\" industrial processes, and the lifestyles dependent on them, use up finite reserves to create products with a finite lifespan, which end up in landfills or in incinerators. The circular approach, by contrast, takes insights from living systems. It considers that our systems should work like organisms, processing nutrients that can be fed back into the cycle ‚Äî whether biological or technical ‚Äî hence the \\"closed loop\\" or \\"regenerative\\" terms usually associated with it. The generic circular economy label can be applied to or claimed by several different schools of thought, but all of them gravitate around the same basic principles. One prominent thinker on the topic is Walter R. Stahel, an architect, economist, and a founding father of industrial sustainability. Credited with having coined the expression \\"Cradle to Cradle\\" (in contrast with \\"Cradle to Grave\\", illustrating our \\"Resource to Waste\\" way of functioning), in the late 1970s, Stahel worked on developing a \\"closed loop\\" approach to production processes, co-founding the Product-Life Institute in Geneva. In the UK, Steve D. Parker researched waste as a resource in the UK agricultural sector in 1982, developing novel closed-loop production systems. These systems mimicked and worked with the biological ecosystems they exploited. Towards the circular economy In 2013, a report was released entitled Towards the Circular Economy: Economic and Business Rationale for an Accelerated Transition. The report, commissioned by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and developed by McKinsey & Company, was the first of its kind to consider the economic and business opportunity for the transition to a restorative, circular model. Using product case studies and economy-wide analysis, the report details the potential for significant benefits across the EU. It argues that a subset of the EU manufacturing sector could realize net materials cost savings worth up to $630 billion annually towards 2025‚Äîstimulating economic activity in the areas of product development, remanufacturing and refurbishment. Towards the Circular Economy also identified the key building blocks in making the transition to a circular economy, namely in skills in circular design and production, new business models, skills in building cascades and reverse cycles, and cross-cycle/cross- sector collaboration. And: Another report by WRAP and the Green Alliance (called \\"Employment and the circular economy: job creation in a more resource efficient Britain\\"), done in 2015 has examined different public policy scenarios to 2030. It estimates that, with no policy change, 200,000 new jobs will be created, reducing unemployment by 54,000. A more aggressive policy scenario could create 500,000 new jobs and permanently reduce unemployment by 102,000.Estimating Employment Effects of the Circular Economy On the other hand, implementing a circular economy in the United States has been presented by Ranta et al. who analyzed the institutional drivers and barriers for the circular economy in different regions worldwide, by following the framework developed by Scott R. In the article, different worldwide environment-friendly institutions were selected, and two types of manufacturing processes were chosen for the analysis (1) a product-oriented, and (2) a waste management. Specifically, in the U.S., the product-oriented company case in the study was Dell, a US manufacturing company for computer technology, which was the first company to offer free recycling to customers and to launch to the market a computer made from recycling materials from a verified third-party source. Moreover, the waste management case that includes many stages such as collection, disposal, recycling in study was Republic Services, the second- largest waste management company in the US. The approach to measuring the drivers and barriers was to first identify indicators for their cases in study and then to categorize these indicators into drivers when the indicator was in favor of the circular economy model or a barrier when it was not.  Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE)  In 2018, the World Economic Forum, World Resources Institute, Philips, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, United Nations Environment Programme, and over 40 other partners launched the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). PACE follows on the legacy of WEF's CEO-led initiative, Project MainStream, which sought to scale up circular economy innovations. PACE's original intent has three focal areas: (1) developing models of blended finance for circular economy projects, especially in developing and emerging economies; (2) creating policy frameworks to address specific barriers to advancing the circular economy; and (3) promoting public‚Äìprivate partnership for these purposes. PACE members include global corporations like IKEA, Coca-Cola, Alphabet Inc., and DSM (company), along with governmental partners and development institutions from Denmark, The Netherlands, Finland, Rwanda, UAE, China, and beyond. Initiatives currently managed under PACE include the Capital Equipment Coalition with Philips and numerous other partners and the Global Battery Alliance with over 70 partners. In January 2019, PACE released a report entitled \\"A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot\\" (in support of the United Nations E-waste Coalition. Circular economy standard BS 8001:2017 To provide authoritative guidance to organizations implementing circular economy (CE) strategies, in 2017, the British Standards Institution (BSI) developed and launched the first circular economy standard \\"BS 8001:2017 Framework for implementing the principles of the circular economy in organizations\\". The circular economy standard BS 8001:2017 tries to align the far-reaching ambitions of the CE with established business routines at the organizational level. It contains a comprehensive list of CE terms and definitions, describes the core CE principles, and presents a flexible management framework for implementing CE strategies in organizations. Little concrete guidance on circular economy monitoring and assessment is given, however, as there is no consensus yet on a set of central circular economy performance indicators applicable to organizations and individual products.  Development of ISO/TC 323 circular economy standard  In 2018, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) established a technical committee, TC 323, in the field of circular economy to develop frameworks, guidance, supporting tools, and requirements for the implementation of activities of all involved organizations, to maximize the contribution to Sustainable Development. Four new ISO standards are under development and in the direct responsibility of the committee (consisting of 70 participating members and 11 observing members). Circular business models Circular business models While the initial focus of academic, industry, and policy activities was mainly focused on the development of re-X (recycling, remanufacturing, reuse, etc.) technology, it soon became clear that the technological capabilities increasingly exceed their implementation. To leverage this technology for the transition towards a circular economy, various stakeholders have to work together. This shifted attention towards business-model innovation as a key leverage for 'circular' technology adaption. Rheaply, a platform that aims to scale reuse within and between organizations, is an example of a technology that focuses on asset management & disposition to support organizations transitioning to circular business models. Circular business models can be defined as business models that are closing, narrowing, slowing, intensifying and dematerializing loops, to minimize the resource inputs into and the waste and emission leakage out of the organizational system. This comprises recycling measures (closing), efficiency improvements (narrowing), use phase extensions (slowing), a more intense use phase (intensifying), and the substitution of products by service and software solutions (dematerializing). These strategies can be achieved through the purposeful design of material recovery processes and related circular supply chains. As illustrated in the Figure, these five approaches to resource loops can also be seen as generic strategies or archetypes of circular business model innovation. Circular business models, as the economic model more broadly, can have different emphases and various objectives, for example: extend the life of materials and products, where possible over multiple 'use cycles'; use a 'waste = food' approach to help recover materials, and ensure those biological materials returned to earth are benign, not toxic; retain the embedded energy, water and other process inputs in the product and the material for as long as possible; Use systems-thinking approaches in designing solutions; regenerate or at least conserve nature and living systems; push for policies, taxes and market mechanisms that encourage product stewardship, for example 'polluter pays' regulations. Critiques of circular economy models There is some criticism of the idea of the circular economy. As Corvellec (2015) put it, the circular economy privileges continued economic growth with soft \\"anti- programs\\", and the circular economy is far from the most radical \\"anti- program\\".Corvellec, Herv√©. (2015). \\"New directions for management and organization studies on waste\\". Technical report. G√∂teborg: Gothenburg Research Institute, University of Gothenburg. Corvellec (2019) raised the issue of multi-species and stresses \\"impossibility for waste producers to dissociate themselves from their waste and emphasizes the contingent, multiple, and transient value of waste\\".Corvellec, Herv√© (2019). \\"Waste as scats: For an organizational engagement with waste\\". Organization, 26(2), 217‚Äì235. \\"Scatolic engagement draws on Reno's analogy of waste as scats and of scats as signs for enabling interspecies communication. This analogy stresses the impossibility for waste producers to dissociate themselves from their waste and emphasizes the contingent, multiple, and transient value of waste\\". Corvellec and St√•l (2019) are mildly critical of apparel manufacturing circular economy take-back systems as ways to anticipate and head off more severe waste reduction programs: Research by Zink and Geyer (2017: 593) questioned the circular economy's engineering-centric assumptions: \\"However, proponents of the circular economy have tended to look at the world purely as an engineering system and have overlooked the economic part of the circular economy. Recent research has started to question the core of the circular economy‚Äînamely, whether closing material and product loops do, in fact, prevent primary production.\\"Zink, T., & Geyer, R. (2017). \\"Circular economy rebound\\". Journal of Industrial Ecology, 21(3), 593‚Äì602. There are other critiques of the circular economy (CE).Lazarevic, D., & Valve, H. (2017). \\"Narrating expectations for the circular economy: Towards a common and contested European transition\\". Energy Research & Social Science, 31, 60‚Äì69. Valenzuela, F., & B√∂hm, S. (2017). \\"Against wasted politics: A critique of the circular economy\\" ephemera: theory & politics in organization, 17(1), 23-60. For example, Allwood (2014) discussed the limits of CE 'material circularity', and questioned the desirability of the CE in a reality with growing demand.Allwood, J. M. (2014). \\"Squaring the circular economy: The role of recycling within a hierarchy of material management strategies\\". In Handbook of recycling: State-of-the-art for practitioners, analysts, and scientists, edited by E. Worrell and M. Reuter. Waltham, MA, USA: Elsevier, page 446. Do CE secondary production activities (reuse, repair, & remake) actually reduce, or instead displace, primary production (natural resource extraction)? The problem CE overlooks, its untold story, is how displacement is governed mainly by market forces, according to McMillan et al. (2012).McMillan, C. A., S. J. Skerlos, and G. A. Keoleian (2012). \\"Evaluation of the metals industry's position on recycling and its implications for environmental emissions\\". Journal of Industrial Ecology 16(3): 324‚Äì333. It's the tired old narrative, that the invisible hand of market forces will conspire to create full displacement of virgin material of the same kind, said Zink & Geyer (2017). Korhonen, Nuur, Feldmann, and Birkie (2018) argued that \\"the basic assumptions concerning the values, societal structures, cultures, underlying world-views and the paradigmatic potential of CE remain largely unexplored\\".Korhonen, J., Nuur, C., Feldmann, A., & Birkie, S. E. (2018). \\"Circular economy as an essentially contested concept\\". Journal of Cleaner Production, 175, 544‚Äì552. It is also often pointed out that there are fundamental limits to the concept, which are based, among other things, on the laws of thermodynamics. According to the second law of thermodynamics, all spontaneous processes are irreversible and associated with an increase in entropy. It follows that in a real implementation of the concept, one would either have to deviate from the perfect reversibility in order to generate an entropy increase by generating waste, which would ultimately amount to still having parts of the economy which follow a linear scheme, or enormous amounts of energy would be required (from which a significant part would be dissipated in order to for the total entropy to increase). In its comment to concept of the circular economy the European Academies' Science Advisory Council (EASAC) came to a similar conclusion: Industries adopting a circular economy= Textile industry  A circular economy within the textiles industry refers to the practice of clothes and fibers continually being recycled, to re-enter the economy as much as possible rather than ending up as waste. A circular textiles economy is in response to the current linear model of the fashion industry, \\"in which raw materials are extracted, manufactured into commercial goods and then bought, used and eventually discarded by consumers\\" (Business of Fashion, 2017). 'Fast fashion 'companies have fueled the high rates of consumption which further magnify the issues of a linear system. \\"The take-make-dispose model not only leads to an economic value loss of over $500 billion per year but also has numerous negative environmental and societal impacts\\" (Business of Fashion, 2018). Such environmental effects include tons of clothing ending up in landfills and incineration, while the societal effects put human rights at risk. A documentary about the world of fashion, The True Cost (2015),Ross, M (Producer), & Morgan, A (Director). (2015, May). The true cost [Motion Picture]. United States: Life is My Movie Entertainment. explained that in fast fashion, \\"wages, unsafe conditions, and factory disasters are all excused because of the needed jobs they create for people with no alternatives.\\" This shows that fast fashion is harming the planet in more ways than one by running on a linear system. It is argued that by following a circular economy, the textile industry can be transformed into a sustainable business. A 2017 report, \\"A New Textiles Economy\\",Ellen MacArthur Foundation, A new textiles economy: Redesigning fashion's future, (2017, http://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/publications). stated the four key ambitions needed to establish a circular economy: \\"phasing out substances of concern and microfiber release; transforming the way clothes are designed, sold and used to break free from their increasingly disposable nature; radically improving recycling by transforming clothing design, collection, and reprocessing; and making effective use of resources and moving to renewable input.\\" While it may sound like a simple task, only a handful of designers in the fashion industry have taken charge, including Patagonia, Eileen Fisher, and Stella McCartney. An example of a circular economy within a fashion brand is Eileen Fisher's Tiny Factory, in which customers are encouraged to bring their worn clothing to be manufactured and resold. In a 2018 interview,The Glossy Podcast. (2018, May 30). Eileen Fisher on 34 years in sustainable fashion: \\"It's about constantly learning\\" [Audio podcast]. Retrieved from https://theglossypodcast.libsyn.com/. Fisher explained, \\"A big part of the problem with fashion is overconsumption. We need to make less and sell less ... you get to use your creativity but you also get to sell more but not create more stuff.\\" Circular initiatives, such as clothing rental startups, are also getting more and more highlight in the EU and in the USA as well. Operating with circular business model, rental services offer everyday fashion, baby wear, maternity wear for rent. The companies either offer flexible pricing in a 'pay as you rent' model like PALANTA.CO does, or offer fixed monthly subscriptions such as Rent The Runway or Le Tote. Another circular initiative is offering a take-back program. A company located in Colorado Circular Threads repurposes post-consumer waste materials such as old denim jeans, retired climbing rope, and discarded sails into new products, rather than letting them go to a landfill. Their take back program allows the consumer to return any product at any time so that it can be recycled again. https://circularthreads.com/pages/about-us Both China and Europe have taken the lead in pushing a circular economy. The Journal of Industrial Ecology (2017)McDowall, W. & Geng, Y. (2017, June). Circular economy policies in China and Europe. Journal of Industrial Ecology, 21 (3). stated that the \\"Chinese perspective on the circular economy is broad, incorporating pollution and other issues alongside waste and resource concerns, [while] Europe's conception of the circular economy has a narrower environmental scope, focusing on waste and resources and opportunities for business\\".  Construction industry  The construction sector is one of the world's largest waste generators. The circular economy appears as a helpful solution to diminish the environmental impact of the industry. Construction is very important to the economy of the European Union and its state members. It provides 18 million direct jobs and contributes to about 9% of the EU's GDP. The main causes of the construction's environmental impact are found in the consumption of non-renewable resources and the generation of contaminant residues, both of which are increasing at an accelerating pace. Decision making about the circular economy can be performed on the operational (connected with particular parts of the production process), tactical (connected with whole processes) and strategic (connected with the whole organization) levels. It may concern both construction companies as well as construction projects (where a construction company is one of the stakeholders). As a good case that fits the idea of circular economy in the construction sector on the operational level, there can be pointed walnut husks, that belong to hard, light and natural abrasives used for example in cleaning brick surfaces. Abrasive grains are produced from crushed, cleaned and selected walnut shells. They are classified as reusable abrasives. A first attempt to measure the success of circular economy implementation was done in a construction company. The circular economy can contribute to creating new posts and economic growth. According to Gorecki, one of such posts may be the Circular economy manager employed for construction projects.  Automotive industry  The circular economy is beginning to catch on inside the automotive industry.European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform There are also incentives for carmakers to do so as a 2016 report by Accenture stated that the circular economy could redefine competitiveness in the automotive sector in terms of price, quality, and convenience and could double revenue by 2030 and lower the cost base by up to fourteen percent. So far, it has typically translated itself into using parts made from recycled materials,Automakers Enter the Circular Economy remanufacturing of car parts and looking at the design of new cars.The Circular Economy In The Automotive Sector: How Far Can We Introduce It?The Circular Economy Applied to the Automotive Industry With the vehicle recycling industry (in the EU) only being able to recycle just 75% of the vehicle, meaning 25% isn't recycled and may even end up in landfills,End-of-Life Vehicle Recycling in the European Union there is much to improve here. In the electric vehicle industry, disassembly robots are used to help disassemble the vehicle.Robot-Assisted Disassembly for the Recycling of Electric Vehicle Batteries In the EU's ETN-Demeter project (European Training Network for the Design and Recycling of Rare-Earth Permanent Magnet Motors and Generators in Hybrid and Full Electric Vehicles) they are looking at the sustainable design issue. They are for example making designs of electric motors of which the magnets can be easily removed for recycling the rare earth metals. Some car manufacturers such as Volvo are also looking at alternative ownership models (leasing from the automotive company; \\"Care by Volvo\\").[https://medium.com/@ECONYL/riding-the-wave-of-change-in-the- automotive-industry-with-circular-economy-5c0428df5cc2 Riding the wave of change in the automotive industry with circular economy Logistics industry The logistics industry plays an important role in the Dutch economy because the Netherlands is located in a specific area where the transit of commodities takes place on a daily basis. The Netherlands is an example of a country from the EU that has increasingly moved towards incorporating a circular economy given the vulnerability of the Dutch economy (as well as other EU countries) to be highly dependable on raw materials imports from countries such as China, which makes the country susceptible to the unpredictable importation costs for such primary goods. Research related to the Dutch industry shows that 25% of the Dutch companies are knowledgeable and interested in a circular economy; furthermore, this number increases to 57% for companies with more than 500 employees. Some of the areas are chemical industries, wholesale trade, industry and agriculture, forestry and fisheries because they see a potential reduction of costs when reusing, recycling and reducing raw materials imports. In addition, logistic companies can enable a connection to a circular economy by providing customers incentives to reduce costs through shipment and route optimization, as well as, offering services such as prepaid shipping labels, smart packaging, and take-back options. The shift from linear flows of packaging to circular flows as encouraged by the circular economy is critical for the sustainable performance and reputation of the packaging industry. The government-wide program for a circular economy is aimed at developing a circular economy in the Netherlands by 2050. Several statistics have indicated that there will be an increase in freight transport worldwide, which will affect the environmental impacts of the global warming potential causing a challenge to the logistics industry, however, the Dutch council for the Environment and Infrastructure (Dutch acronym: Rli) provided a new framework in which it suggests that the logistics industry can provide other ways to add value to the different activities in the Dutch economy, such as, an exchange of resources (either waste or water flows) for production from the different industries, in addition, to change the transit port concept to a transit hub. Moreover, the Rli studied the role of the logistics industry for three sectors, agriculture and food, chemical industries and high tech industries.  Agriculture  The Netherlands, aiming to have a completely circular economy by 2050,Circulair Nederland 2050 has also foreseen a shift to circular agriculture (kringlooplandbouwKringlooplandbouw) as part of this plan. This shift foresees having a \\"sustainable and strong agriculture\\" by as early as 2030.Omslag naar duurzame en sterke landbouw definitief ingezetRealisatieplan Visie LNV: Op weg met nieuw perspectief Changes in the Dutch laws and regulations will be introduced. Some key points in this plant include: * closing the fodder-manure cycle * reusing as much waste streams as possible (a team Reststromen will be appointed) * reducing the use of artificial fertilizers in favor of natural manure * providing the chance for farms within experimentation areas to deviate from law and regulations * implementing uniform methods to measure the soil quality * providing the opportunity to agricultural entrepreneurs to sign an agreement with the Staatsbosbeheer (\\"State forest management\\") to have it use the lands they lease for natuurinclusieve landbouw (\\"nature-inclusive management\\") * providing initiatives to increase the earnings of farmers  Furniture industry  When it comes to the furniture industry, most of the products are passive durable products, and accordingly implementing strategies and business models that extend the lifetime of the products (like repairing and remanufacturing) would usually have lower environmental impacts and lower costs. Companies such as GGMS are supporting a circular approach to furniture by refurbishing and reupholstering items for reuse. The EU has seen a huge potential for implementing a circular economy in the furniture sector. Currently, out of 10,000,000 tonnes of annually discarded furniture in the EU, most of it ends up in landfills or is incinerated. There is a potential increase of ‚Ç¨4.9 billion in Gross Value Added by switching to a circular model by 2030, and 163,300 jobs could be created. A study about the status of Danish furniture companies' efforts on a circular economy states that 44% of the companies included maintenance in their business models, 22% had take-back schemes, and 56% designed furniture for recycling. The authors of the study concluded that although a circular furniture economy in Denmark is gaining momentum, furniture companies lack knowledge on how to effectively transition, and the need to change the business model could be another barrier. Another report in the UK saw a huge potential for reuse and recycling in the furniture sector. The study concluded that around 42% of the bulk waste sent to landfills annually (1.6 million tonnes) is furniture. They also found that 80% of the raw material in the production phase is waste.  Oil and gas industry  The uptake to reuse within the oil and gas industry is very poor, the opportunity to reuse is never more evident, or possible, as when the equipment is being decommissioned. Hundreds of thousands of tons of waste are being brought back onshore to be recycled. Unfortunately, what this equates to; is equipment, which is perfectly suitable for continued use, being disposed of. In the next 30‚Äì40 years, the oil and gas sector will have to decommission 600 installations in the UK alone. Over the next decade around 840,000 tonnes of materials will have to be recovered at an estimated cost of ¬£25Bn. In 2017 North Sea oil and gas decommissioning became a net drain on the public purse. With UK taxpayers covering 50%‚Äì70% of the bill, there is an urgent need to discuss the most economic, social and environmentally beneficial decommissioning solutions for the general public. Organizations such as Zero Waste Scotland have conducted studies to identify areas with reuse potential, allowing equipment to continue life in other industries, or be redeployed for oil and gas . Strategic management and the circular economy The CE does not aim at changing the profit maximization paradigm of businesses. Rather, it suggests an alternative way of thinking how to attain a sustained competitive advantage (SCA), while concurrently addressing the environmental and socio- economic concerns of the 21st century. Indeed, stepping away from linear forms of production most often leads to the development of new core competencies along the value chain and ultimately superior performance that cuts costs, improves efficiency, meets advanced government regulations and the expectations of green consumers. But despite the multiple examples of companies successfully embracing circular solutions across industries, and notwithstanding the wealth of opportunities that exist when a firm has clarity over what circular actions fit its unique profile and goals, CE decision- making remains a highly complex exercise with no one-size-fits-all solution. The intricacy and fuzziness of the topic is still felt by most companies (especially SMEs), which perceive circular strategies as something not applicable to them or too costly and risky to implement.Cristoni, Nicol√≤ and Marcello Tonelli (2018). \\"Perceptions of Firms Participating in a Circular Economy.\\" European Journal of Sustainable Development 7(4): 105-18. doi: 10.14207/ejsd.2018.v7n4p105 This concern is today confirmed by the results of ongoing monitoring studies like the Circular Readiness Assessment.\\"Circular Readiness Assessment website\\" http://www.worldynamics.com/circular_economy/web/assessment/main Retrieved on 26 July 2018 Strategic management is the field of management that comes to the rescue allowing companies to carefully evaluate CE-inspired ideas, but also to take a firm apart and investigate if/how/where seeds of circularity can be found or implanted. The book Strategic Management and the Circular Economy defined for the first time a CE strategic decision-making process, covering the phases of analysis, formulation, and planning. Each phase is supported by frameworks and concepts popular in management consulting ‚Äì like idea tree, value chain, VRIE, Porter's five forces, PEST, SWOT, strategic clock, or the internationalization matrix ‚Äì all adapted through a CE lens, hence revealing new sets of questions and considerations. Although yet to be verified, it is argued that all standard tools for strategic management can and should be calibrated and applied to a CE. A specific argument has already been made for the strategy direction matrix of product vs market and the 3 √ó 3 GE-McKinsey matrix to assess business strength vs industry attractiveness, the BCG matrix of market share vs industry growth rate, and Kraljic's portfolio matrix.Tonelli Marcello and Nicolo Cristoni (2018). Strategic Management and the Circular Economy. https://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Management-Circular- Routledge-Research/dp/1138103632 New York: Routledge. Impact in Europe On 17 December 2012, the European Commission published a document entitled \\"Manifesto for a Resource Efficient Europe\\". This manifesto clearly stated that \\"In a world with growing pressures on resources and the environment, the EU has no choice but to go for the transition to a resource-efficient and ultimately regenerative circular economy.\\" Furthermore, the document highlighted the importance of \\"a systemic change in the use and recovery of resources in the economy\\" in ensuring future jobs and competitiveness, and outlined potential pathways to a circular economy, in innovation and investment, regulation, tackling harmful subsidies, increasing opportunities for new business models, and setting clear targets. The European environmental research and innovation policy aims at supporting the transition to a circular economy in Europe, defining and driving the implementation of a transformative agenda to green the economy and the society as a whole, to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the program Horizon 2020, which is also open to participation worldwide.See Horizon 2020 ‚Äì the EU's new research and innovation programme: http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm Circular economy is found to play an important role to economic growth of European Countries, highlighting the crucial role of sustainability, innovation, and investment in no-waste initiatives to promote wealth.Hysa, E.; Kruja, A.; Rehman, N.U.; Laurenti, R. Circular Economy Innovation and Environmental Sustainability Impact on Economic Growth: An Integrated Model for Sustainable Development. Sustainability 2020, 12, 4831., https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/12/4831/htm The European Union plans for a circular economy are spearheaded by its 2018 Circular Economy Package. Historically, the policy debate in Brussels mainly focused on waste management which is the second half of the cycle, and very little is said about the first half: eco-design. To draw the attention of policymakers and other stakeholders to this loophole, the Ecothis, an EU campaign was launched raising awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of not including eco-design as part of the circular economy package. Related concepts The various approaches to 'circular' business and economic models share several common principles with other conceptual frameworks: Biomimicry Janine Benyus, author of \\"Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature\\", defined Biomimicry as \\"a new discipline that studies nature's best ideas and then imitates these designs and processes to solve human problems. Studying a leaf to invent a better solar cell is an example. I think of it as 'innovation' inspired by nature\\". Blue economy Initiated by former Ecover CEO and Belgian entrepreneur Gunter Pauli, derived from the study of natural biological production processes the official manifesto states, \\"using the resources available...the waste of one product becomes the input to create a new cash flow\\". (see: www.theblueeconomy.org) Cradle to cradle Created by Walter R. Stahel and similar theorists, in which industry adopts the reuse and service-life extension of goods as a strategy of waste prevention, regional job creation, and resource efficiency in order to decouple wealth from resource consumption. Industrial ecology Industrial Ecology is the study of material and energy flows through industrial systems. Focusing on connections between operators within the \\"industrial ecosystem\\", this approach aims at creating closed-loop processes in which waste is seen as input, thus eliminating the notion of undesirable by-product. Resource recovery Resource recovery is using wastes as an input material to create valuable products as new outputs. The aim is to reduce the amount of waste generated, therefore reducing the need for landfill space and also extracting maximum value from waste. Systems thinking The ability to understand how things influence one another within a whole. Elements are considered as 'fitting in' their infrastructure, environment and social context.  \\"The Biosphere Rules\\"  The Biosphere Rules is a framework for implementing closed-loop production processes. They derived from nature systems and translated for industrial production systems. The five principles are Materials Parsimony, Value Cycling, Power Autonomy, Sustainable Product Platforms and Function Over Form.

It is located near Deutsches Eck at the confluence of the Rhine and the Moselle. A fountain called Kastorbrunnen (\\"Castor well\\") was built in front of the basilica during Napoleon‚Äôs invasion of Russia in 1812. Pope John Paul II raised St. Castor to a basilica minor on 30 July 1991. This church is worth seeing for the historical events that have occurred in it, its extensive Romanesque construction and its largely traditional furnishings. Since 2002, the Basilica of St. Castor has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of the Upper Middle Rhine Valley. In addition, it is a cultural property protected under the Hague Convention. History  Emperor Louis the Pious donates money to construct St. Castors church The church of St. Castor was built between 817 and 836 by Hetto, the Archbishop of Trier with the support of Emperor Louis the Pious, just outside the city of Confluentes (the city founded by the Romans in the area) and dedicated on 12 November 836. As Koblenz had a Frankish royal court, Louis was in charge of the construction of the church and it was built as a Carolingian proprietary church. However, Louis did not come to Koblenz until after the consecration of the church. This points to the importance of the Archbishop in the building of the church, especially as the church was until the 13th century outside the city of Koblenz. The church honours St. Castor, who is said to have worked as a missionary on the Moselle in the 4th century and to have founded a religious community in Karden. Rizza, the alleged daughter of Louis the Pious, is venerated in the church as a saint of the city of Koblenz and her shrine still stands in the church. In 836 the church was ordained as a Carolingian hall with a rectangular chancel, but it was extended later in the 9th century with a transept with a semicircular apse. It had become part of the monastery of St. Castor, with its priest living a monastic life. The monastery of St. Castor was closely connected with the history of the Holy Roman Empire in the 9th century. In 842 provisions of the division of the Frankish kingdom were negotiated there by 110 representatives of the sons of Louis the Pious, Lothair I, Charles the Bald and Louis the German, resulting in the Treaty of Verdun signed in 843, which divided the Frankish Empire into three parts (West Francia, Middle Francia and East Francia). The monastery of St. Castor became an important meeting place for emperors and kings and their descendants and place where disputes between emperors and kings were negotiated and settled. In June 860, talks took place to settle the Carolingian family‚Äôs internal disputes. Negotiations at the monastery of St. Castor in 862 led to further territorial changes, which was part of the evolution of the Carolingian Empire into an Eastern and a Western Empire, from which the Holy Roman Empire (and eventually Germany) and France developed. A cella memoriae (Latin for a small building over a grave which is dedicated to the memory of the deceased) was built in front of the choir as a chapel-like burial vault connected with the church by a circular crypt. In the 10th century, the enclosure was extended to the east as a choir in the form of a rotunda. Probably originating at the same time were the two side aisles of the nave and the lower part of the west end the building (the entrance). It was flanked by two round towers, replaced in 1103 by the two towers that exist today. The towers were originally, however, only five stories high. In 1138, Conrad III, the first Hohenstaufen was elected by an assembly of the princes of the Holy Roman Empire at St Castor‚Äôs. The reconstruction of the church to its present shape and size began about 1160 under Provost Buvo. He demolished the crypt, the choir rotunda, the apse and the burial vault and built the present east wing as a square, vaulted choir space with flanking towers, a semi-circular apse, a treasury and a sanctuary. After 1200, the two western towers were each increased by one story, to make the current seven story towers. St. Castor‚Äôs was damaged in the battle of 1199 between Otto IV and Philip of Swabia in the dry bed of the Moselle near Koblenz. Repairs were made and the nave needed to be reconstructed. The Archbishop of Trier John I inaugurated the renovated church, together with its altars on 27 July 1208. The building completed in 1208 had a flat ceiling, but by the end of the 13th century this had been replaced by a vaulted roof. Deutschherrenhaus with the Cross of the Teutonic Order One of the two stellar vaults In 1110, the Archbishop of Trier, Bruno of Lauffen founded a hospital in Koblenz next to St. Castor‚Äôs, one of the first institutions for nursing north of the Alps. Archbishop Theodoric of Wied in 1216 invited the Teutonic Knights to Koblenz and gave them part of the site of St. Castor's along with the hospital of St. Nicholas located there. One motivation for the establishment of the order in Koblenz was to undertake nursing at the hospital. Soon after the Deutschherrenhaus was established close by at Deutsches Eck, where the Moselle flows into the Rhine, to manage the order‚Äôs Koblenz bailiwick (Ballei). The bailiwick was under the direct authority of the Grand Master. This branch of the Teutonic Order was originally called the Deutscher Ordt and later the Deutsches Eck. In 1338, the last important meeting was held at the church. Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian and Edward III of England swore allegiance and friendship at St. Castor‚Äôs. From 1496 to 1499, vaulting was installed to replace the Romanesque roof. At the same time, two star vaults were erected in the nave and above the altar. As a result of the secularisation of church lands agreed at the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss (‚ÄúPrincipal Conclusion of the Extraordinary Imperial Delegation‚Äù) of 1803, St. Castor‚Äôs became a collegiate church with monastery buildings on its west facade and on its south side. Under the leadership of the Prussian inspector of buildings, Johann Claudius von Lassaulx a complete restoration of the interior began in 1830, which soon came to a standstill due to lack of money. As a result of a legacy of the dean Edmund Bausch and a gift of King Frederick William IV the restoration was carried out from 1848 to 1849. Between 1840 and 1860, the interior was provided with frescoes. The final appearance of St. Castor‚Äôs was restored between 1890 and 1894, when the entire church was provided with a veneer of tuff. At the same time, the brickwork of the south aisle was renewed. On 6 November 1944 St. Castor‚Äôs was damaged by a British air raid. In March 1945 the outer walls were also damaged by artillery. The stone material including the vault, however, remained largely intact. In 1948 enough money was raised for its reconstruction and a 25-year renovation began. Extensive renovation and restoration work was carried out on the towers in 1979 to 1990. The restoration omitted the western gallery and of the organ of 1728. A new main organ was built in the transept in 1962. A small choir organ was additionally bought in 1990 and placed below the main organ. The main organ was removed in 2013 and a new main organ is installed in 2014 on west wall above the church entry. Pope John Paul II raised St. Castor's to a basilica minor on 30 July 1991. Construction  The font of the church The church is built as a basilica with a nave and two aisles. The narrow eastern transept towers over the aisles. The choir, which was built around 1160, with a round, three-story apse flanked on both sides by a five-story tower. The third floor of the apse is a dwarf gallery with 21 arches. Some of the columns around the windows carry a lion as a symbol of Christ. Above the entrance is a chapel of St. Michael. A war memorial erected in 1963 in the lobby is also dedicated to St. Michael. The steep gables of the rhomboid roof (rhombendach) on the western towers were installed at the beginning of the 13th century. Only two simply structured pilasters in the basement of the western towers date from the Carolingian period. The church including the entrance hall is 58.25 m long and its overall width is 25.3 m. The towers are 44 m high, 6 m wide and 6.8 m deep.

In the La T√®ne period there was a hut here deepened with two fireplaces. A Gallo- Roman temple was built around 100 and stood there until the beginning of the 7th century, when a memorial was created with a Christian cemetery. The square in front of St. Castor‚Äôs has been the location since 1812 of a fountain called Kastorbrunnen, which has a humorous comment referring to the Napoleonic wars, which also affected Koblenz.

Pinholster at the Oglethorpe University.Georgia Trend It is a kind of continuity offense in which players move around in a circular pattern to create good scoring opportunities. The wheel offense is a popular offensive play, frequently used by teams from middle school to college levels because it can effectively work against any defense, including zone defense and man-to-man defense.Coach a Winning Team: Wheel Offense Strategy There are various ways to run the wheel offense. The original form of the wheel offense developed by Garland Pinholster starts with a 2-1-2 formation, where two players stand edge by edge at the free throw lane.Pinholster, Garland F. (1966). Pinholster‚Äôs wheel offense for basketball. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. By using sets of screens and cuts, this 2-1-2 formation can be maneuvered into a 1-3-1 formation, with the ball-handler on the wing. Once in position, the player in the low post (the second cutter) will set a screen for the ball-handler (the first cutter). The first cutter quickly passes the ball to the player on top at the perimeter (the fourth cutter), and then, depending on how the defense react, makes a cut to the basket either down the base line or over the top from the free throw line. Meanwhile, the fourth cutter will pass the ball to the player on the other wing (the fifth player), and quickly go down to the free throw lane and set a screen for the second cutter. The second cutter then make another cut across the free throw line. After the first two cuts are clear, the player in the middle at the free throw lane (the third cutter), who have been setting double screens for the previous two cuts, will now fake a step towards the basket and then break off to the top on the side of the circle, and the fourth cutter will go to the wing position initially taken by the first cutter. Note that at this point the players are again in the original 1-3-1 formation, except flipped to the other side. During the time the other players are making the play, the fifth player on the other wing, now having received the ball from the player at the top, needs to watch if any good shot opportunity occurs and make appropriate passes. If the first cutter gets rid of the defense, he or she will get the ball for an easy layup down the basket. If the second cutter gets open, he or she will get the ball for a quick catch and shoot at the free throw line. If the first two cuts are unsuccessful, the third cutter will receive the ball and drive down the lane for a layup, if possible. Even if there is no good opportunity during the whole play, the players are now again in the 1-3-1 formation, and are ready to initiate another wave of offense. Advantages of using the wheel offense The wheel offense is very advantageous to use. First it is very flexible and easy to set up. All the positions in the wheel offense are interchangeable (i.e. the point guard doesn‚Äôt have to be the first cutter).This enables the ball-handler to start the wheel offense from either wing without the other players changing their positions.How to Coach the Wheel Man-to-Man Basketball Offense With its flexibility, the wheel offense blends well with both half-court attack and fast break. Once the play is set up, the wheel offense can work effectively against both man-to-man defense and zone defense. The various cuts and double screens will create open shot opportunities if the defense fails to react quickly. Even if the defensive players manage to cover all the cutting offensive players, they are forced to switch match-ups. Switching match-ups often causes mismatches between offensive players and defensive players, and when mismatch happens, the offensive team often take advantage of it to score. Also, when a team runs the wheel offense, their game tempo will be very hard to disrupt. The wheel offense can also integrate other offensive plays. Pinholster's Oglethorpe team would often run some concealment plays before they start the wheel offense. This made the wheel offense very hard to detect, and they could catch the defense off guard. During the play, when the wheel offense is in the 1-3-1 formation, it can also switch to other plays based on the same formation. This greatly increases the variation of the wheel offense, making it very hard to defend. Moreover, the wheel offense is very helpful for team-building. Because the wheel offense demands every player to have good ball-handling and shooting skills, each player is forced to develop more fully. In the wheel offensive play, five players play as a team rather than individuals. Thus practicing and running the wheel offense is very helpful for developing a team spirit among the players. Requirements for using the wheel offense There are a few conditions need to be satisfied before using the wheel offense. Some are listed below. * The wheel offense works better for a balanced team than a team that relies on one or two superstars. * To run the wheel offense, the team has to have good ball-handling skills. The first cutter needs to use good timing, speed and ingenuity. The second cutter needs to be good at shooting. * The big men on the team have to move, though not necessarily fast, to set screens for the cutting players.

Located in the modern suburb of Kerameikos, it led to the namesake ancient cemetery, and to the roads connecting Athens with the rest of Greece. The gate was of major ceremonial significance as the starting point of the procession of the Great Panathenaea, and accordingly it was a large, monumental structure, \\"the largest gate of the ancient world\\". Erected in 478 BC as part of Themistocles' fortification of Athens and rebuilt in the 300s BC, it remained standing and in use until the 3rd century AD. History The Dipylon gate was built, along with the neighbouring Sacred Gate, in 478 BC as part of Themistocles' fortification of Athens following the Persian Wars. The new circuit was much wider than the old one that was destroyed by the Persians, and many of the graves and monuments of the already existing Kerameikos cemetery were used in its construction, a fact which earned Themistocles the hostility of many Athenians whose relatives' tombs were despoiled. During the Peace of Nicias (421‚Äì416 BC), the wall was complemented by a moat and a secondary wall (proteichisma). The construction of the Pompeion in the empty space between the Dipylon and Sacred Gate began shortly after, but was not completed until the next century. The Themistoclean Wall was torn down after the Athenian defeat in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC, but in 394 BC, with the help of Persian funds, the Athenian statesman Conon restored it. The gate was not only the principal gate for the city's communication with the rest of Greece‚Äîwith roads leading both north to Boeotia and south to the Peloponnese, but also played an important part in the city's rituals, as the starting point (along with the adjacent Pompeion) of the ceremonial procession to the Acropolis of Athens during the Great Panathenaea. Outside the gate lay the Kerameikos cemetery and specifically the Demosion Sema, the state cemetery where the city buried its most honoured citizens. According to the 2nd-century AD writer Lucian, the walls of the gate were written over with graffiti such as love messages. In its original state, it comprised a set of double gates set further back from the line of the walls, so that a square court was created that, covered by the walls and four towers set in its corners, served as a killing ground against attackers. The gate received its name in the 3rd century BC; before that‚Äîpossibly in combination with the nearby Sacred Gate‚Äîit was known as the Thriasian Gates (ŒòœÅŒπŒ¨œÉŒπŒ±Œπ Œ†œçŒªŒ±Œπ), as it led to the Thriasian Plain. Repairs to the fortifications in the Kerameikos were carried out under Demosthenes after the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, but the wall and the Dipylon suffered heavy damage in an earthquake in subsequent years, so that they were rebuilt, following the original outline, in , when Athens was under the control of Demetrios Poliorketes. In 267‚Äì262 BC, Athens participated in the unsuccessful Chremonidean War against Macedon; lead tablets with the mark and price of horses and their owners that date to this period, probably a record of the Athenian cavalry, have been found in a well at the Dipylon. In 200 BC, however, when Philip V of Macedon attacked Athens, the fortifications of the Dipylon helped the Athenians fend off the Macedonian king. In late Hellenistic times, a second wall with a double gate was added at the outer side of the court, thus creating a fully walled-off enclosure. The walls could not hold off the Roman general Sulla, however, who in 86 BC sacked the city. Plutarch reports that the slaughter in the city was so great, that \\"blood flowed through the gate and flooded the suburb\\". The wall was repaired soon after, so that the city was able to withstand the attacks of Quintus Fufius Calenus in 48 BC. In the Roman Imperial period, the city experienced a revival, and potters and metalworkers settled in the buildings around the Dipylon. During the long Pax Romana, the walls were allowed to fall into disrepair. With the onset of the barbarian invasions in the 3rd century, Emperor Valerian () restored the city wall, but this was not enough to prevent the sack of Athens by the Heruli in 267. In its aftermath, the city contracted to a small fortified core around the Acropolis of Athens, but gradually recovered and expanded again during Late Antiquity, so that Emperor Justinian I () restored the Themosticlean Wall. Shortly after, however, the Slavic invasions began, and the Dipylon and the entire area were abandoned, fell quickly into ruin, and were buried. Archaeological excavations in the Kerameikos area began by the Greek Archaeological Society in 1870, under St. Koumanoudis. At the time, the site was covered by up to 8 m of soil. Since 1913, excavations in the area have been conducted by the German Archaeological Institute at Athens. Layout and description Layout of the gate complex of Kerameikos in , including the Dipylon, the Sacred Gate, and the Pompeion The Dipylon was the \\"largest gate of the ancient world\\", with a surface of . Its extraordinary size points to its use not only as a city gate, but also its ceremonial significance and monumental role as the starting point of the Panathenaic procession. Themistoclean structure The original, Themistoclean-era gate largely established the final shape of the structure and covered the same area as the Hellenistic structure, and was built of clay bricks on top of a pedestal of Poros limestone blocks. Its general shape resembles a right-angled trapezoid, with the gates located on the cityward, right-angled lateral side. The bases were of unequal length, with the southern one projecting a bit. Square towers were located at each corner of the trapezoid. Archaeological evidence shows traces of later repairs, possibly under Conon, when the pedestal was covered with flat limestone blocks. Parts of the Themistoclean wall are preserved only between the northwestern and southwestern towers, but the towers themselves preserved several Archaic-period funeral monuments that were used as spolia during their construction, and were recovered by archaeologists. The existence of two gates in the wall already during the Themistoclean phase is confirmed by preserved cart grooves; the southern gate is also crossed by a broad canal, which went parallel to the southern wall and then turned south, probably joining the Eridanos river nearby. Hellenistic structure The Hellenistic gate complex was an altogether more massive and elaborate affair, being built of large finely hewn ashlar blocks, comprising a breccia core and covered with fine Piraeus sandstone slabs. Apart from the north-eastern landward tower, the cores of the others survive to some height even today; originally they were probably covered with a tiled roof. The curtain wall connecting them, originally high and thick and crowned with crenelations, some of which survive on the southern wall. Access to both the walls and the towers was through staircases, one of which survives behind the cityward southeastern tower. The northern cityward gate is still visible, but the southern one has been destroyed through the construction of a modern canal. However, the remains of the gate frames show that the gates were rectangular, in contrast to the second set of gates added in the late Hellenistic period, which were surmounted by marble apses. The pedestal of the central pier of the later set was built of marble spolia; in front of it, facing outward from the city, is a square marble pedestal, which may have hosted an equestrian statue of a Roman emperor or general. Well house Just after the cityward gate, on the eastern side, between the gate and the stairway leading up to the wall, are the remnants of a well house, which was supplied with fresh water through underground aqueducts. The present structure was probably erected during the gate's reconstruction in 307/4 BC, but likely also had a Themistoclean antecedent, of which two pipes and a few Ionic column bases survive. The structure was rectangular, divided into an L-shaped basin with low walls into which water flowed, and a small entrance hall that was supported by three Ionic columns. The entrance was between the second and third column. The floor, which largely survives, was built of marble slabs from Hymettus. Proteichisma The proteichisma (œÄœÅŒøœÑŒµŒØœáŒπœÉŒºŒ±, \\"fore-wall\\"), which includes a wall as well as a moat in front of it, was erected during the Peloponnesian War, most likely as part of the repairs to the walls following an earthquake in 420 BC. They were extensively rebuilt under Conon, and again under Demetrios Poliorketes in the late 4th century. Traces of the proteichisma survive particularly intact in the Kerameikos area, including remnants of 4th- century BC pitfall traps against siege engines, consisting of high pithoi let into the ground. The proteichisma comprised an ‚Äìhigh wall, placed some in front of the main wall. As the ground sloped heavily between the two walls, the space had to be filled in, thus creating a flat surface that served as a ring road, that in the 4th century ran around the entire circuit of the wall and was used to connect the various quarters of the city. Following the reconstruction of the walls in 307/4 BC, however, this ceased to be the case, as the proteichisma received a roofed chemin de ronde, blocking the road. The late 4th-century BC proteichisma was built of fine ashlar breccia masonry.

He was most closely associated with the magazine The New Yorker. Hamilton was noted for his wit and irony and for presenting his characters, most often examples of modern, affluent types, with distinctive \\"ski-jump\\" noses noted for a peculiar shape that has become a sort of unofficial trademark. Biography Hamilton was born in Palo Alto, California in 1939.\\"William Hamilton.\\" Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale, 2001. Gale Biography In Context. Web. 3 May. 2011. Hamilton grew up on the family estate Ethelwild in St. Helena, California. While he came from a moneyed family [great grandson of Mark Lyndsay McDonald], his father was an unemployed, free-spending eccentric amateur inventor. Hamilton later said \\"We lived on one of those dwindling trust funds with a hint of money in the past, but not much in the present\\". The house, inherited from an uncle, was much as it was in 1901, and Hamilton tells of ancient pencils that shattered upon use. Hamilton's interest in cartooning was sparked by stacks of European magazines found in the house. Hamilton attended Phillips Academy, where the relatively poor Hamilton studied alongside the children of the wealthy. He said that the experience of being \\"out of place\\" was \\"an ideal experience for going into the arts\\" and \\"the process of being an alien gives you the distance to be an artist.\\" He went on to Yale, where he drew cartoons and covers for campus humor magazine The Yale RecordHamilton, William (September, 1960). Cover Illustration. The Yale Record. New Haven: Yale Record. and was a member of Skull and Bones. He graduated from Yale in 1962 with a degree in English. While serving in the US Army (1963‚Äì5) he sold his first cartoon to The New Yorker in 1965. In the World Encyclopedia of Cartoons, Richard Calhoun describes Hamilton's work: His friend Lewis H. Lapham described Hamilton's work: \\"You were never in doubt about who the cartoonist was. He had a particular beat, as it were ‚Äî the preppy world, the world of Ralph Lauren, the Protestant WASP establishment that was on their way out, holding onto their diminishing privileges.\\" In 1969, Hamilton married Candida Vargas, granddaughter of Get√∫lio Vargas, dictator of Brazil. They separated in 1976. The disintegration of his marriage prompted his turn to playwriting, and his first play Save Grand Central was \\"about the middle of the end of a marriage.\\" Hamilton's plays document the same world as his cartoons, and sometimes recycle lines from his cartoons. His play White Chocolate has been described as \\"a farce about race and class in the upper echelons of New York society.\\" Hamilton married Eden Collinsworth in 1986. The marriage produced a son and ended in divorce circa 2001. Hamilton married Lucy Young Hamilton in 2003. Hamilton died in a car accident in Lexington, Kentucky, on April 8, 2016. He was 76. He was survived by his wife, along with his children Gilliam Collinsworth Hamilton and Alexandra Hamilton Kimball.

The Motte of the earliest castle survives, and stones of the second castle are incorporated in the present house. Comyn's castle The first castle was owned by the Comyn Family and was granted to the Fleming family after Robert the Bruce killed John 'the Red' Comyn in 1306 in Greyfriars kirk. The Motte of this Motte and Bailey castle can still be made out in Cumbernauld House Park just north east (approximately 360 metres) of Cumbernauld House. The Fleming family then constructed the second and larger castle on the site. Recent researchhttps://cumbernauldhouse.wordpress.com/2015/05/17/historical-intrigue- at-cumbernauld-castle/ Toronto Papers has uncovered a charter, dated 3 November 1421, was issued at Cumbernauld Castle and was used to formally grant James Fleming his father's land, following allegations of murder. Fleming of Boghall and Cumbernauld Blaeu - Atlas of Scotland 1654, shows Cumbernad Cast. and Cummernad Wood in Sterlin-shyr. Based on Timothy Pont's map below When the Flemings came to construct their castle at the end of the 14th century, the best they would have been able to build would have been a strong stone tower. The country was much too impoverished to permit anything more ambitious, such as the great courtyard strongholds built before the death of Alexander III. Such a tower would have been an \\"L-Plan\\", a rectangular block with a wing projecting at the end of one of the long sides. A few small timber or stone outbuildings would also have been attached. As time went on, and the power and influence of the family grew, the castle would have been enlarged by the addition of other stone structures, such as a great hall for festive occasions. In March 1544, an unexpected English visitor during the War of the Rough Wooing, Edmund Storey, a servant of Thomas Wharton, described his reception by Lord Fleming; > \\"On the morrow, in riding towards Stirling, we came to Lord Fleming's castle > of Cumbernall, and alighted near the castle gates, at which the Scotsman > knocked and told the porter that a servant of the Master of Maxwell's came > with a message. Thus I got access to Flemyng and said that a servant of Lord > Wharton's was at the gates with letters for him. He was astonished, but sent > for me, I thereupon delivered him the King's letters both to him and > Maxwell. He kissed the letters and took off his bonnet, saying: \\"Jesus > benedicite! how thou durst come hither into this country? but I am glad that > thou art come to my house, and since thou art here the highest stone shall > be the lowest ere thou shalt take any skaith.\\" \\"Letters and Papers Henry > VIII, vol. 19 part 1 (1903) no. 299 (3) & footnote (here returned to 1st > person) Timothy Pont's Map of Cumbernauld, c.1590 - close-up below Pont's Map close-up Lord Fleming meant that he rather see his house destroyed than any harm come to this English visitor. The site of this castle is where Cumbernauld house stands today and although the original tower has disappeared, blocks of its masonry can be picked out amongst the stones used to construct Cumbernauld House. Part of the courtyard buildings are still standing, particularly the wall that separates the lower service area from the car park. on the lower side of this there is a long row of corbels or projecting stones, of a distinctive 16th century pattern, designed to support timbers of a lean to building. The castle played host to the royalty of Scotland. James IV wooed Margaret Drummond at Cumbernauld Castle, where Margaret's sister was married to Lord Fleming. The Drummonds' sisters lie buried in Dunblane Cathedral following their poisoning by a government determined to marry an unwilling King James to the sister of Henry VIII of England, Margaret Tudor. The murders made James IV a frequent visitor to Cumbernauld, Margaret Tudor accompanying him on one occasion. Mary Fleming was one of the four \\"Queen's Maries\\". Mary and her brother, James, Lord Fleming went into exile with Mary, Queen of Scots in France in 1548. In 1558, Lord Fleming was one of the Scottish Commissioners arranging the Queen's marriage to the Dauphin of France. Fleming and other commissioners died mysteriously on the voyage home, poison being suspected. Mary, Queen of Scots, visited the castle and planted a yew tree at Castlecary Castle, only a mile or two away, which still grows there. The whole great hall collapsed while the queen was staying there on 26 January 1562, and 7 or 8 men were killed.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 1, (1898), p. 597, no. 1071. Most of the queen's party were out hunting, Mary was not hurt and visited the relatives of those who were injured or killed in the village below. In 1640, eighteen Scottish noblemen met at Cumbernauld to sign the Cumbernauld Bond to oppose the policies of the Earl of Argyll who controlled the dominant political faction in Scotland. Cumbernauld may have been created a Burgh of barony in 1649,http://www.scottishmining.co.uk/157.html although there is some dispute from Hugo Millar. The Earl of Wigton was ordered to garrison the castle in 1650.https://archive.org/stream/royallettersinst00mait#page/130/mode/1up Wigton papers pg 130 Cumbernauld Castle was besieged and largely destroyed by Cromwell's General Monck in 1651. Irvine records that the old castle was burned to the ground by \\"a party of Highlanders during the rebellion of 1715.\\"https://archive.org/stream/bookdumbartonsh04irvigoog#page/n442/mode/1up The Book of Dunbartonshire pg 397 On maps Probably the earliest map which shows the castle is Pont's Map but is much easier to pick out on Blaeu's coloured map above. These are reminiscent of the modern Friends of the Glen map which is also a stylised representation of the Park.Excellent stylised map from Friends Of Cumbernauld Glen Map including Vault GlenHerman Moll's 1745 map has a brief mention of Cumbernard Castle even though it had been replaced by the House in 1731 unless the reference is to the stable destroyed in 1746. The top section of Charles Ross' map from 1777 has a section on Cumernauld and shows the castle has been replaced by the house and also has some obscure placenames like Hollinhirst (sometimes spelled Holland Hirst or Holland Hirxt) which don't appear on modern maps. None of the maps show the \\"Ridburn\\" or its tributaries with any accuracy although The Bog Stank and Walton Burn seem to be shown. Another stream named as the Horseward Burn is mentioned and is shown to join with the Red Burn. The \\"Luggie fl.\\" features on Pont as flowing into \\"Kirkintillo\\" but seems to have no connection with Cumbernauld or the mysterious Horseward Burn. On Pont 32 the Luggie originates in a neat archaeological note in Latin northeast of Glasgow. It says: > Vestigia valli Romanorum quod > videtur Agricolam aut Adrianum > Primum posuisse Which translates as: > 'the remains of the Roman fortification which > it seems Agricola or Hadrian > first built' > > There is also Gordon's second and longer note, just west of Cumbernauld > (lower centre), says: > > \\"this part joyneth not w[ith] [th]e rest > of [th]e Lennox but outthruch to it > be annextion it is cald [th]e > parochin of [th]e Leinyie\\" > The dotted line running west‚Äìeast across the map represents the line of the Roman Antonine Wall. The Pont map overlaps with the Glasgow and Lanark Pont 34 map which is the only one which is dated as near Kirkintilloch it says: > Sept. et > Octobr. > 1596 Descri > pta The Luggie W. is mentioned on that map too in large rotated handwriting but there is little clarity on the watercourse. Whether Pont had even heard of \\"The Meeting of the Waters\\" is unclear. Caledonian white cattle At the time of Queen Mary's visits the park was still stocked with deer and wild white cattle. Many were taken for the table of Regent Lennox in Edinburgh in 1570 when John, Lord Fleming fought for the rights of the exiled Queen.

Archaeological research After the new house was built, the castle was converted to stables, and was burnt down by dragoons posted here in 1746. One original wall can still be seen in the allotment area. In 1963-64, Cumbernauld Historical society, in co-operation with Glasgow archaeological society excavated an area to the north east of Cumbernauld House and uncovered part of the domestic periphery of the castle, comprising a 15th-century rubbish chute, an adjoining prison and cellar and a well-house reached by a flight of steps. In 1981-82 Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district museums excavated an area adjacent to the earlier excavation and found a cobbled courtyard, the base of a circular building and significant walling. These excavations have been filled back in. References * CKDC Museums Fact Sheet - The Fleming Castle. * Millar, Hugo (1980) A history of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth from earliest times.

When he was six months old the family moved to Kingston, Ontario where his father joined Queen‚Äôs University as a professor of chemical engineering. He has two younger brothers, Bob and Leon. Hsu is of Chinese descent and is fluent in the French and Mandarin languages. He graduated in 1980 from Loyalist Collegiate and Vocational Institute in Kingston, at age 16. Hsu was a talented chess player in his youth, eventually reaching Class A strength. In 1984, he graduated from Queen‚Äôs University with a B.Sc. Hons. in Physics. He then pursued graduate studies at Princeton University, where he received his Ph.D. in physics in 1989 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \\"Towards an understanding of the large U-Hubbard model and a theory for high temperature superconductors\\", under the supervision of Philip W. Anderson. He did post- doctoral research in Chalk River, Vancouver, and France.

He was also the executive director of SWITCH, a Kingston-based not-for-profit association that promotes job creation and investment in sustainable energy. Politics He served for four years as the treasurer of the Kingston and the Islands Federal Liberal Association, and was an active member of its Policy Committee. He worked in the 2007 and 2008 provincial and federal Liberal campaigns for John Gerretsen MPP and Peter Milliken MP. Following Milliken's announcement in summer 2010 that he would not run again, a nomination contest was set up, and in November, Hsu won the Liberal nomination for the next federal election. He defeated four other contenders: former Kingston Mayor Harvey Rosen, Queen's University Law Dean Bill Flanagan, former Kingston City Councillor Bittu George, and law professor Philip Osanic. In the federal election held on May 2, 2011, Hsu defeated Conservative candidate Alicia Gordon by less than 3,000 votes. The election was the Liberal Party's worst showing in its history and Hsu was one of only two new Liberals elected in the country. On June 1, 2011, interim Liberal leader Bob Rae announced that Hsu would serve in the Liberal Party shadow cabinet as the Critic for Science and Technology, and for the Federal Economic Development Agency of both Southern and Northern Ontario.

(See Canada 2011 Census) After leaving the House of Commons, Ted Hsu became a co-chair of Kingston's task force on housing. In 2019, Hsu managed the successful re-election campaign of Mark Gerretsen, the Liberal MP who replaced him. The following year, Hsu announced his campaign for candidacy in the Ontario Liberal Party citing a need for someone with his science policy experience amid the coronavirus pandemic. One of his competitors is former MPP Sophie Kiwala who had Hsu as her campaign manager but lost her seat in the 2018 Ontario general election.

The name Putat came from the name of the tree, putat which is the famous tree in that place that it could be proud of. But until this generation, no one of Putatnons knew when Putat was settled to become the Barangay Putat.  History  Until this present time, no one know when Putat was settled and perhaps its foundation maybe traced back when Don Mariano Montebon founded the Municipality of Tuburan in 1851. Even if no one knew when it was founded; Putat certainly got its name from the name of the tree \\"putat\\", a tree that belongs to genus Barringtonia. Old folks said that these trees thrived in the riverbanks and swamps on the place a long time ago but nowadays, one can rarely see it thriving and maybe considered as endangered. Some people also believe in the legend of how the tree first came into the place.  Legend of Putat = Geography  Putat is one of the 54 barangays of the Municipality of Tuburan which is located in the northwestern part of Cebu. This barangay shares its boundary to the Municipality of Tabuelan, Cebu to the north and to the east are Barangay Kampoot and Barangay Lusong. It is bounded by Barangay Macupa and Barangay Bagasawe to the south and Ta√±on Strait to the west. It is 97 kilometers away from Cebu City via Lugo, Borbon, approximately 123 kilometers via Naga-Toledo route and about 85 kilometers away traversing the Transcentral Highway. Putat's terrain is level to highly rolling. Level lands are found in areas bordering the shoreline. One of the seven river systems in Tuburan is found in this barangay, the Chinese River. The source of this river is located in the areas of the Municipality of Sogod, while one of its tributaries is coming from Barangay Montealegre. This river system creates a watershed area, one of the largest in the municipality. The barangay also has four springs which are major sources of potable water, most famous of which is the mystical Biti-an Spring. Other springs are the Guiwanon Spring, one in Sitio Ilaya San Miguel, and one in Sitio Ilaya San Roque.  Climate  Just like the other barangays of Tuburan, Putat falls under the third type of climate in the Philippines characterized by not very pronounced maximum period of rainfall and with a short dry season from March to June.  Sitios  This barangay is divided into sitios namely: * Duminla * Ilaya San Miguel * Ilaya San Roque * Kalumbangan * Kanghamog * Mando * Mangga * Matnog * Matugawe * Onggo * Sambag * Suba * Tapon * Timbacol  Demographics  See also: Being one of the 54 barangays of Tuburan, Putat belongs to the partly urban areas in the Philippines. According to the 2010 Census of Population and Housing, Putat has 4,001 residents.  Religion  Majority of the people in this barangay are Roman Catholics; other religious groups include: Iglesia ni Cristo, Baptist, and other Christian religions.  Government  Every city and municipality in the Philippines is divided into barangays, the smallest of the Local Government Units. Barangays can be further divided into sitios and puroks but those divisions do not have leaders elected in formal elections supervised by the national government. A barangay's executive is the Punong Barangay or barangay captain and its legislature is the Sangguniang Barangay, composed of barangay captain, the Barangay Kagawads (barangay councilors) and the SK chairman.  Attractions  This simple and serene barangay has a number of scenic spots to be proud of. * Biti-an Spring. This spring located alongside the river was noted for its mystic waters. The water actually looks like a boiling water coming beneath the ground. One could see white butterflies flying around the place (believed to be fairies in the spring). * Cambunyag. Located in the shores of Sitio Mangga, this rock that looks like a ship is believed to be the ship of Maria Tang-an. Others say that it was a ship struck by lightning a long time ago. * Bagtingon Cliff. This is a wide cliff located along the shoreline near the border of Putat and Bagasawe. Fisherfolks and seashell gatherers claimed to hear mysterious bells ringing in that place. Bagtingon means \\"to ring\\". * Chinese River. This river that traverses the barangay is a place of trade a long time ago. It often brings rich soil suitable for growing vegetables and other crops to Sitio Ilaya making it the \\"Vegetable Basket of Putat\\". * Putat History Tree. It is located above the Municipal Cemetery in Sitio Tapon. This tree is said to be the living witness of the historic World War II for a battle happened in that place. Before, one could see skeletons, war helmets and bullets, but the locals burned the area for they were afraid of the skeletons. Some took the helmets and bullets as souvenirs and could not be traced anymore. * San Antonio Abad Parish Church. This beautiful church was built in honor of San Antonio Abad (patron batok sa sunog in Cebu). The facade of this Roman Catholic Church has beautiful columns. * Matnog Beach. * Sunset.  Education  Putat has three public schools namely: Putat Elementary School, Matnog Elementary School and Putat National High School.  San Antonio Abad Parish  Putat became a parish in honor of San Antonio Abad (Saint Anthony the Abbot) on July 28, 1974 together with seven other barangays of Tuburan: Bagasawe, Bulwang, Kampoot, Lusong, Macupa, Montealegre and Siotes. Its first parish priest was Rev. Fr. Hilario Narsico.

It also designed and developed its own armament and ammunition in addition to the licensed production of foreign weapons, including a Portuguese version of the Heckler & Koch G3 (Espingarda m/961) widely used during the Portuguese Colonial War.  History  The military industry of Bra√ßo de Prata has its origins in a number of ammunition depots, pyrotechny workshops and armament repair facilities established between 1850 and 1887 and belonging to the Portuguese Army's arsenal (). The F√°brica de Bra√ßo de Prata itself dates back to a royal decree of 1902, which mentioned the creation of a new factory at the region with the same name, in Marvila, Lisbon, to replace the Fundi√ß√£o de Canh√µes and F√°brica de Armas in the production of artillery and small arms. Construction began in 1904 and it was inaugurated with the name F√°brica de Proj√©cteis de Artilharia (Artillery Shell Factory) on October 12, 1907, beginning production of 75mm ammunition for Schneider‚ÄëCanet guns on July 15, 1908. In 1911, with a new reorganization of the military industry, the factory changed its name to F√°brica de Material de Guerra (War Material Factory) and the next year received small arms manufacturing and repairing machinery from F√°brica de Armas, of Santa Clara, Lisbon. During this time, the factory also started producing 81 mm mortars and Bergmann submachine guns. In 1929, the factory began manufacturing Vickers machine guns in small quantities for the Armed Forces and the production of the MP 28 submachine gun to equip the Army and the Pol√≠cia de Seguran√ßa P√∫blica. With another reorganization in 1927, the name of the factory changed to F√°brica de Muni√ß√µes de Artilharia, Armamento e Viaturas (Artillery Ammunition, Armament and Vehicle Factory) and the Arsenal do Ex√©rcito was extinguished and all armament factories taken over by the War Ministry. Bra√ßo de Prata's facilities then received major overhauls and was modernized. In July 1937, a contract was signed with Mauser Werke for the acquisition of the Mauser 98k (M98K) for the Portuguese Army, which were supplied as kits from factories in Germany to be assembled at Bra√ßo de Prata. Later in 1941, more 50,000 Mausers 98k were purchased and also assembled at the factory. In 1939, the factory also exported 40,000 7.92√ó57 mm Mauser- Vergueiro rifles (m/1904/39). After World War II, another major reorganizationDecreto-Lei 2.005. March 14, 1945Decreto-Lei 2.020. March 19, 1947 of the military industry went underway and the Bra√ßo de Prata's factory was renamed to F√°brica Militar de Bra√ßo de Prata (FMBP). In 1947, Portugal received aid from the Marshall Plan, being 2.730 million dollars invested in FMBP to expand the factory's Ammunition Section to two production lines, one for artillery and another for mortars. In 1948, FMBP started the production of the FBP submachine gun, which was found to be simple and cheap to manufacture, and the following year the production of 105 mm artillery shells started with the signing of contract to supply 350,000 shells to the United States Army.Mais Alto 373, p. 7 Later in 1959, West Germany placed orders for 105 mm and 9√ó19mm Parabellum ammunition and hand grenades. Those orders contributed to the further expansion of the factory. At the beginning of the 1960s, and at the start of the Ultramar conflict, Portugal acquired a relatively small number of assault rifles comprising 2,825 Heckler & Koch G3 and 4,795 FN FAL. After operational field trials in Angola, the HK G3 was selected to equip the Portuguese Armed Forces as the new service rifle. FMBP started then in 1962 to manufacture under license the G3 (model 63), including the manufacture of its components and parts and its final assembly. Later, West Germany placed an order for 50,000 G3 for its own armed forces. In 1970, FMBP proposed the merger with its sister F√°brica Nacional de Muni√ß√µes de Armas Ligeiras (National Ammunition and Small Arms Factory, FNMAL); however, it never was followed through. After the war, there were financial problems due to late payments by the Portuguese Armed Forces in relation to the armament supplied during the war; however exports, specially ammunition exportation by FNMAL, helped both factories remain open. During this time, weapon design and development continued and in 1976 a new version of the FBP submachine gun was developed but never entered production nor was exported. Following national economical problems, the public defense industry underwent a new reorganization and a new company, INDEP, was created to incorporate the assets of both FNMAL and FMBP, which were to be extinguished in their current forms. However, the factories were never merged and completely absorbed by INDEP and instead continued to exist under its management and under new names. FMBP was then renamed F√°brica de Bra√ßo de Prata (Bra√ßo de Prata Factory, FBP) and a large part of its facilities were moved to the industrial park of FNMAL, now named F√°brica Nacional de Muni√ß√µes (National Ammunitions Factory, FNM) at Moscavide. After 1982, a new artillery ammunition company, SPEL, was created as a private company and was owned by both FNM and FBP. In 1986, FBP developed two new projects, led by Capit√£o Engenheiro Rog√©rio Prina, for the manufacturing of a submachine gun. The first was a license-built Heckler & Koch MP5 but its small serial production was abandoned after INDEP selected the manufacturing of the Lusa submachine gun design developed in the early 1980s. The Lusa was then distributed for evaluation to the Portuguese Armed Forces and some law enforcement agencies, however these decided to purchase the MP5 directly from Heckler & Koch. In 2003, 105 Lusa guns were sold to the British company York Guns and the following year INDEP sold all of Lusa's tooling, machinery and manufacturing rights. Following the reduction of domestic armament orders and the closing of numerous national armament factories and further major reorganizations of the government-owned defense industry, FBP was closed in 1998 and its machinery, tools and manufacturing rights were sold to companies in the United States and the Spanish Santa B√°rbara Sistemas companies, including the 5.56√ó45mm NATO ammunition manufacturing line.

They often include the ingredients of energy drinks as well. In 2010 and 2011, this type of drink faced criticism for posing health risks to their drinkers. In some places there is a ban on caffeinated alcoholic drinks. Energy drinks are drinks that contain high doses of caffeine and an assortment of ingredients, such as, * Taurine- amino acids * Guarana- compound of stimulants- plant-based * Ginseng ‚Äì herbs * B vitamins  Health risks  In 2010, the FDA advised that caffeinated alcoholic beverages should not be consumed because of the counteracting effects of caffeine and alcohol. The FDA posited that caffeine often causes consumers to drink more than they normally would because caffeine can mask some of the sensory cues individuals might normally rely on to determine their level of intoxication. This masking of intoxication then leads individuals to engage in behaviors that they would otherwise avoid if they understood their true level of intoxication. However, research has not fully supported this tenet. For example, one study found that Australian students thought they were more intoxicated when mixing caffeine with alcohol than when consuming alcohol on its own for every level of blood alcohol content. Consuming high levels of caffeine was associated with more alcohol-related consequences than when consuming alcohol on its own, even when consuming relatively little alcohol. It may be that caffeine causes individuals to focus on the stimulant effects of the intoxication, which have been associated with greater perceived intoxication than the depressant effects of alcohol. Norberg, Newins, Crone, Lam, Henry, Mills, & Dennis (2019). Why are caffeinated alcoholic beverages especially risky? Addictive Behaviors, 98, 106062. doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2019.106062  Research  Universities have conducted studies to compare the outcomes of the consumption of regular alcoholic drinks and of caffeinated alcoholic drinks. The University of Florida surveyed 802 college students who had mixed alcohol and caffeine, and found they were three times more likely to leave a bar highly intoxicated and four times more likely to want to drink and drive than drinkers who did not consume alcoholic energy drinks. Another study surveyed 697 students from Wake Forest University and found that the students who had consumed caffeinated alcoholic drinks were more likely to drink and drive, take advantage of someone sexually, or end up needing medical treatment.\\"U.S. Students Mourn Alcohol and Caffeine Drink Four Loko.\\" UK Wired. 13 Dec. 2010. From this perspective, it is inferred that caffeinated alcoholic drinks cause one to act in ways that would be less likely if one were drinking non-caffeinated alcoholic drinks.  US reactions  The adverse effects of caffeinated alcoholic drinks have led to increased regulation. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a substance intentionally added to food (such as caffeine in alcoholic drinks) is deemed \\"unsafe\\" and is unlawful unless its particular use has been approved by FDA (Food and Drug Administration) regulation. The substance is subject to a prior sanction until the substance is Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS).\\"U.S. Food and Drug Administration: FDA to Look Into Safety of Caffeinated Alcoholic Beverages.\\" Drug Week Newsletter 4 December 2009: page 1622. In order for a substance to be characterized as GRAS, there must be sufficient evidence to prove its safety; this evidence should be generally known and accepted by qualified professionals. The FDA did not approve the use of caffeine in alcoholic drinks, and thus the drinks cannot be legally marketed. As a result, the FDA sent letters to four manufacturers of caffeinated alcoholic drinks (Phusion Projects, Charge Beverages Corporation, New Century Brewing Company, and United Brands Company, Inc.) to alert them that the agency would be considering whether caffeine can lawfully be added to alcoholic drinks. These letters also gave the manufacturers fifteen days to stop the addition of caffeine to the alcoholic drinks or to stop selling the drinks altogether. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also took action against the four companies, warning that their marketing tactics might violate federal law and urging them to take swift and appropriate steps to protect consumers.Goodnough, Abby. \\"F.D.A. Issues Warning Over Alcoholic Energy Drinks.\\" The New York Times 18 November 2010, final ed.: A25. The day before the FDA sent out the warning letters, Phusion Projects, a five-year-old Chicago company, said it would stop putting caffeine in the drinks and put a non-caffeinated version of the drink on the market in December 2010. In a statement, the company's founders said that they still believed it was safe to blend caffeine and alcohol but wanted to cooperate with regulators. The FDA continues work with Phusion Projects and other manufacturers to assure their products meet safety standards.  International reactions  In Canada, regulations restrict the manufacture and sale of caffeinated alcoholic drinks unless the caffeine comes from a natural ingredient such as guarana; caffeine as an ingredient cannot be directly added to an alcoholic drink. In Mexico, caffeinated alcoholic drinks cannot be sold in bars or nightclubs. In Australia, the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy is considering regulation to address the growing concerns over the drinks. The government of New South Wales is looking to ban the sale of the drinks from clubs and bars. In Scotland, the Scottish Labour Party called for a ban on caffeinated drinks, such as the fortified wine Buckfast.

NERC was formed in 2005 under the Obasanjo administration‚Äôs economic reform agenda through the Electric Power Sector Reform Act, 2005 for formation and review of electricity tariffs, transparent policies regarding subsidies, promotion of policies that are efficient and environmentally friendly, and also including forming and enforcing of standards in the creation and use of electricity in Nigeria. NERC was instituted primarily to regulate the tariff of Power Generating companies owned or controlled by the government, and any other generating company which has a license for power generation and transmission of energy, and distribution of electricity.  History  Electric power generation in Nigeria began in 1896. In 1929, the Nigeria Electric Supply Company (NESCO) was established. In 1951, the Electric Corporation of Nigeria (ECN) was established to take over the assets of NESCO. In 1962, NDA (Nigeria Dams Authority) was established to develop the hydropower potentials in Nigeria. In 1972, ECN and NDA were merged to form NEPA (National Electric Power Authority), which later meta morphosized to Power Holding Company of Nigeria, as a holding company for its imminent unbundling and subsequent privatization. Previously, the Federal Ministry of Power oversees the electric power sector in Nigeria. It served both as the policy making body and the regulator; doing the latter mostly through the Electrical Inspectorate Services, a department in the Ministry. The electric power sector in Nigeria started with the Niger Dams Authority which controlled the Dams around Shiroro and River Niger. Due to abysmal power crises in the whole of Nigeria, the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo made efforts through the National Council for Privatisation/Bureau for Public Service (under the leadership of Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai to reform the sector which has seen no investment or major government attention since the 1980s. The NERC was formed through the EPSRAct of 2005 and it was inaugurated on 30 October 2007 with Ramsome Owan as its first Chairman/CEO. Dr. Ransome Owan, a US trained scientist who once worked for GE, was appointed for a five-year term as the executive Chairman of NERC. On his team included other Nigerians living in Diaspora who came in to work for NERC. NERC was given additional responsibilities for setting up and administering a fund called ‚ÄúPower Consumer Assistance Fund‚Äù which shall subsidize underprivileged power consumers in Nigeria. It also had the mandate to regulate the rural systems and determine the contribution rates to be sent to the Rural Electrification Fund.  Powers and duties of NERC  The Commission's powers and duties are provided for in the EPSRAct 2005, and effectively ushered the privatization of electric power services in Nigeria, unbundling of the defunct National Electricity Power Authority (NEPA)/Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN). NERC‚Äôs primary duty is protect the interests of consumers, issue licenses to operators/investors, set and review electricity tariffs and where possible promote competition. The Commission's main objective is to protect existing and future consumers' interests in relation to electricity generated and that conveyed by distribution or transmission systems. Consumers' interests are their interests taken as a whole, including their interests in affordable tariffs and safe, reliable and available electricity supply, and the reduction of greenhouse gases to them. Structure of NERC The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission is governed by a tenured Board of Commissioners, headed by a Chairman. The current chairman is James Adeche Momoh, a Professor of Electrical Engineering with Howard University, USA was inaugurated Chairman/Chief Executive of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) on May 3rd , 2018. This was sequel to the Senate confirmation of his nomination by President Muhammadu Buhari. The Nigerian President nominates one nominee Commissioner to represent his/her geopolitical zone in the country for a fixed tenure of 4 years, renewable once only. The Chairman/CEO, has a period of 5 years, also renewable once only. The nominees are duly screened by the Nigerian Senate. The Board of Commission of NERC issues orders on electricity matters in Nigeria. It makes regulatory decisions and issues final license to investors/operators. It also settles industrial disputes through its ADR mechanism in an open hearing. NERC is divided into seven Divisions: Office of the Chairman/CEO, Engineering, Standards and Safety Division, Finance and Management Services Division, Government and Consumer Affairs Division, Legal Licensing and Enforcement Division, Market Competition and Rates Division, and the Renewable Energy/Research and Development Division. Reform of electricity sector in Nigeria The Electric Power Sector Reform Act of 2005 established NERC's authority to impose mandatory reliability standards on the transmission system and to impose penalties on companies that manipulate the electricity markets. Since Independence from the UK, Nigeria has built 12 power plants. Nigeria produces as much electricity as North Dakota for 249 times more people, with blackouts 320 times per year per information from the World Bank. The EPSRAct of 2005 gave NERC additional responsibilities as outlined in NERC's Wide Important Goals. As part of that responsibility, NERC: * Regulates the generation, transmission, distribution and marketing of electricity in Nigeria and with Nigeria; * Licenses and inspects private and corporate electric power projects 10MW and above; where 1-10MW are issued Captive Licenses; * Ensures the reliability of generation plants, high voltage transmission system and the zonal distribution system; * Ensures occupational health and safety of persons involved with electricity in the whole sector. * Monitors and investigates energy markets; * Uses civil penalties and other means against energy organizations and individuals who violate NERC rules in the energy markets; * Administers accounting and financial reporting regulations and conduct of regulated companies. In recent years, the NERC has been promoting the voluntary formation of Independent Electric Transmission Networks (IETNs) and Independent Electric Distribution Networks (IEDNs) to eliminate the potential for undue discrimination in access to the electric grid. However, since the generation capacity is low and the transmission not robust, NERC has developed regulations to push for the primary provision of supply, electric reliability and implementation of new regulations keeping in sight when the sector fully develops. NERC regulates over 40 licensees in Nigeria. It is also responsible for permitting the construction of network of transmission lines by the Transmission Company of Nigeria, the transmission monopoly in Nigeria formed as a successor company of the PHCN. NERC works closely with the Nigerian Ministry of Environment and other related bodies in reviewing the safety, security and environmental impacts of proposed power plants and transmission networks. In November 2013, Nigeria auctioned off 6 power plants, one belonging to Tony Elumelu, chairman of Heirs Holdings. Nigeria will need 170,000MW per day for its 174 million people. Transmission lines are outdated, ineffective, and power is stolen from electric poles, since metering does not exist. Board of Commissioners A new set of commissioners were sworn into office on February 7, 2017, filling a vacuum that had existed from December 2015 when the term of the last Board led by Mr. Sam Amadi expired. Sam Amadi served as Chairman/CEO of the Commission from December 18, 2010 to December 2015. During the 14 month vacuum, Anthony Akah acted as Chairman/CEO of the Commission.

It was constructed in 1877, in petition for relief from the Grasshopper Plagues that devastated Midwest farmland between 1873 and 1877.  History = Plagues  The first chapel built on this site was known as Maria Hilf, which means \\"Mary's Help\\" in German. At the time of its original construction in 1877, much of the Midwest was suffering from locust plagues. The plagues began in the summer of 1873, when Rocky Mountain Locusts laid claim to a territory spreading from southern Wyoming over Nebraska and the Dakotas all the way to Iowa and Minnesota. The first year the grasshoppers came looking for food and found it in the plentiful wheat fields, where they laid eggs. The newly hatched grasshoppers were wingless for the first six to eight weeks of life, but their work was no less devastating. Until they could fly, they crawled along and feasted on the tender new growth of crops. When their wings grew strong enough, they flew off for another field. This cycle would continue from 1873 to 1877, bringing widespread destruction to a part of the country primarily dependent on an agricultural economy. Large black clouds made up of thousands of grasshoppers moved from field to field, from county to county. One historian reported that \\"grasshoppers, sixty to eighty per square yard, could devour one ton of hay per day each forty acres they covered.\\" The grasshoppers ate everything and anything: crops, fruit trees, wooden fork handles, even clothing. In her book On the Banks of Plum Creek, Laura Ingalls Wilder records her eyewitness accounts of the plight of these plagues. She relates how they could not even keep grasshoppers out of the milk pail while milking. She tells how some men headed to the eastern side of the state to find work on unaffected farms. The farmers who stayed to fight the plague resorted to desperate measures. Some used smudge pots to keep the grasshoppers in flight. Others set their doomed crops on fire in order to kill the fledgling grasshoppers. Many farmers resorted to catching them by hand or in buckets. People started building makeshift \\"hopper dozers\\". These machines consisted of pieces of sheet metal smeared with tar, which would be dragged over infested fields. The grasshoppers would get stuck in the tar and be wiped off and burned at each end of the field. However, the grasshoppers devastated crops at a speed that no human invention could compete with. The number of grasshoppers and the destruction they brought with them grew each year. By the spring of 1877, grasshopper eggs covered approximately two thirds of Minnesota. Each year, the Minnesota State Legislature appropriated more and more funds to assist its distressed citizens with the purchase of seed and even the necessities of food and clothing. People began to lose their faith in man-made interventions. They turned to spiritual means to relieve the devastation caused by the plague. Minnesota governor John S. Pillsbury declared April 26, 1877 a statewide day of prayer.\\"Assumption Chapel\\" accessed April 5, 2011. That night and the following day the weather shifted and the rain which fell soon turned to snow. The people thought this could be the event to impede the grasshoppers' destructive advances, but when the storm passed they were as plentiful as ever.  The chapel  In Stearns County, about a month after the Statewide day of Prayer, newly ordained Father Leo Winter, OSB, was assigned to the Parish of St. James in Jacobs Prairie with the mission of St. Nicholas some eight miles away. In the midst of the plague, Father Winter encouraged the people to continue their prayers of supplication. Father Winter felt that they should petition the Virgin Mary to intercede for them to God for relief from the grasshoppers. Father Winter talked over the idea with fellow parishioners. They decided to build a chapel in Mary‚Äôs honor and to offer Masses of Thanksgiving every Saturday. The parishioners of the two parishes agreed. They would build a chapel \\"to honor the mother of God, to take refuge in her as their intercessor and be freed from the ravages of the grasshopper plague.\\" Two farmers donated seven acres halfway between the two parishes of St. James and St. Nicholas. Construction on the Chapel began July 16, 1877. Laura Ingalls Wilder recorded that the grasshoppers left suddenly that month. All told, the chapel cost a total of $865 and was completed in less than a month. The day after completion, August 15, 1877, Father Winter consecrated the altar and celebrated the first Mass. According to a document signed and notarized with six witnesses, by the time the second mass was offered on September 8, 1877, no grasshoppers remained.  Legacy  There has not been a grasshopper plague in Minnesota or the Midwest at large since 1877. The masses in Maria Hilf continued as promised, and the farmers began to harvest successful crops the next year. The original chapel was destroyed June 28, 1894, by a tornado. The wooden chapel was picked up and smashed into a grove of trees. The destruction was complete--except for a statue of the Virgin Mary, which stood unharmed in the rubble. The hill would stand vacant for fifty-eight years.  Description  Stone inscription above chapel door, reading \\"Assumpta est Maria\\" In 1952, in honor of the centennial of the diocese of Saint Cloud, the Chapel was rebuilt. The current chapel stands sixteen by twenty-six feet, the approximate size of the original building. It was constructed of rough granite, much of which was donated by the Cold Spring Granite Company. The inside of the Chapel is simple and has no pews, only an altar. The chapel walls are made of polished agate and carnelian granite. The Chapel features four stained-glass windows. Above the altar stands the wooden statue that had been carried in procession through the Cold Spring community at the time of the Chapel's original consecration. The most telling feature and testimony to the history of the chapel is the stone carving above the door. It is inscribed \\"Assumpta est Maria\\" (\\"Mary has been taken up\\"), referring to the new name given to this reconstructed chapel. Mary is pictured, and at her feet, bowing in submission, are two grasshoppers.  Today  This new chapel was dedicated on October 7, 1952. Today, in continuation of the Chapel's tradition of petitioning for good harvests, there is an annual August 15 Mass celebrated on the Hill. Also, since 1990, for nine consecutive weeks in May and June, Mass is celebrated on Thursday evenings; a novena for the intention of a safe planting season and a good harvest. The surrounding parishes take turns celebrating the mass.

The Board inherited the responsibilities of the Witham General Drainage Commissioners, who were first constituted by an Act of Parliament of 1762. They manage the land drainage of an area to the west of the River Witham, between Lincoln and Dogdyke, which includes the valley of the River Slea to above Sleaford. The district is divided into a number of compartments, as it is intersected by embanked rivers which cross the area, carrying water from the Car Dyke, which acts as a catchwater drain at the western boundary, to the Witham on its eastern edge. Most of the parishes were enclosed in the late 1700s, by separate Acts of Parliament, and steam-powered drainage was introduced from the 1830s. Steam engines were gradually replaced by oil and diesel engines, and most have since been superseded by electric pumps. The Witham First District IDB maintains thirteen pumping stations and of drainage channels. Organisation The River Witham passes through low-lying land in Lincolnshire, which is susceptible to flooding. In 1762, an Act of Parliament was passed, which created the Witham General Drainage Commissioners, and divided the area into six districts, each with responsibility for land drainage. These were called the Witham First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Districts. The First District covered an area of , bounded on the north and east by the river, and on the south and west by the Car Dyke, an ancient navigation channel. The Fifth District covered a much smaller area of between Billinghay Skirth and Kyme Eau, the lower part of the River Slea. It became part of the First District in 1953. There were initially 23 commissioners for the district, one elected by each of the eighteen parishes which formed the First District, and another five from parishes in the Fifth District. Each district also elected some of the 31 General Drainage Commissioners. Seven came from the First District and another two from the Fifth District. The remainder came from the other four similar bodies created by the original Act. The Land Drainage Act 1930 made provision for the creation of internal drainage boards. The Witham and Steepings Catchment Board, who were responsible for the rivers at the time, proposed the creation of the Witham First District IDB, which took effect from 8 January 1934. In 1951, the Board was restructured to include six extra members, when the Witham Fifth District IBD was abolished, and was effectively amalgamated with the First District. Its area of responsibility was extended in 1968, when parts of fourteen parishes and the Urban District of Sleaford came under its jurisdiction, and the board was again restructured on 7 July 1993, to include representatives from local Councils, as required by the Land Drainage Act of 1991. Landscape The district is effectively broken up into compartments by a number of rivers, acting as highland carriers, whose water level is normally above that of the surrounding land, but flooding is prevented by flood banks. The main river is the Witham, running broadly north to south through the district, but there is also the Car Dyke, which runs parallel to the Witham and further to the west, acting as a catchwater drain for water which would otherwise flow into the low-lying region. Between them, running broadly west to east, are seven other channels. Beginning in the north, below Lincoln, and working south towards Boston, these are Sandhill Beck, Branston Delph, Nocton Delph, Metheringham Delph, Timberland Delph, Billinghay Skirth, and Kyme Eau, which is another name for the lower part of the River Slea. The water level of most of these is normally the same as that of the Witham, but they are fitted with pointed doors where they meet, which are designed to close by gravity if water levels in the Witham rise significantly. They are all classified as main rivers, and are therefore managed by the Environment Agency. The total length of rivers passing through the district or adjacent to it is , and they are restrained by of banks. Sect:3 The area managed by the First District IDB lies to the east of the Lincoln Edge, a limestone escarpment which is a prominent feature of Lincolnshire. Several small streams are fed by springs on its dip slope, and the Car Dyke intercepts these. It connects with the heads of the Delphs, discharging water from the streams into them by gravity. At Billinghay Skirth, a small sluice connects the two waterways. The district covers an area of , of which all but is agricultural land. The catchment for the district includes an additional . Within the district, are a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest, and the of Metheringham Delph are a nature reserve. Development Before the eighteenth century, the district was open common land, where those living in adjoining parishes had grazing rights. The fens were used as summer pasture, as they were frequently flooded for most of the winter period. Efforts to improve the Witham by straightening the channel, making it deeper, and constructing the Grand Sluice to the north of Boston did not prevent flooding. Following the passing of the 1762 Act, the structure was in place to address these issues. The commissioners had responsibility for the district, but also powers to collect rates, to ensure that the drainage works could be built and maintained. For administrative purposes, the district was divided up into a number of sub-districts, based on parish boundaries and enclosure acts. A series of Acts of Parliament, passed between 1779 and 1840 authorised improvements to these sub-districts, and initial attempts to drain the land used wind-pumps. The work had significant effects on land values. Arthur Young, writing in 1799, noted that land which was previously let at one shilling and sixpence (7.5p) per acre (0.4 ha), was now valued at between eleven shillings (55p) and seventeen shillings (85p) per acre. A Commissioner called Mr. Parkinson estimated that the rental value of had risen from ¬£5,982 to ¬£42,375. This was \\"effected by a moderate embankment and the erection of windmills for throwing out the superfluous water.\\" The science of Fen drainage was not well understood when the first enclosure acts were passed, and it was thought that flooding might be worse if the embankments were placed too close to the river. Consequently, the Dales Head Dyke was constructed, about to the west of the Witham, and the land between it and the river was used as washland, and was flooded for up to nine months each year. By 1797, the process was better understood, and an Act of Parliament authorised the reclaiming of of washland, by moving the banks much closer to the river, and extending the banks at the sides of several fens to join the repositioned flood bank. A drainage engine was to be moved from Blankney Fen to Martin Fen, and the documents were to be stored in a chest in Timberland Church, where they could be viewed on payment of one shilling (5p). Pumping engines By the 1840s, several steam-powered pumping stations had been built, to pump water from the drains into the river more efficiently. Early installations, such as that at Dunston and Metheringham, consisted of a beam engine driving a scoop wheel. By 1913, this had been replaced by a steam engine driving a pump made by Smithdale, which was itself replaced by a oil engine and a Gwynnes Limited pump between 1933 and 1943. Two electric motors with Gwynnes pumps replaced them in 1952, located at a different site, and in 1990, a submersible electric pump was installed at a third site. An Act to enclose the fen land in the parish of Branston was obtained in 1765, and another for the parish of Potterhanworth in 1774. This also gave the Commissioners powers to build banks, engines and sluices. A third Act was obtained in 1789, which authorised the embanking of in Nocton, Potterhanworth and Branston. It included provision for enlarging the Car Dyke, and raising its eastern bank. In 1812, the Witham was straightened by cutting the South Delph, and the part of Branston parish which was now on the east bank of the Witham became known as Branston Island. Drainage was by a wind engine, but this was not adequate for the job, and in 1832 a further Act was obtained to allow a steam engine to be used. The Witham Commissioners thought that the extra volume of water and the speed with which it would be pumped would damage the river banks, and sought an injunction to prevent the use of steam power. This was refused, and a engine was installed. Much of the fen was flooded in 1862, when a section of the South Delph flood bank failed. The Great Northern Railway Company, who owned the Witham at this time, argued that although the river was their responsibility, the bank was not, as it was not specifically mentioned in the 1812 Act. However, Lincoln Assizes decided differently, and awarded damages to those affected by the flood. The engine was replaced by a Marshall steam engine and Gwynnes pump sometime in the early twentieth century, which was itself replaced by a Ruston oil engine in 1940. An Allen-Gwynnes electric motor driving a axial flow pump was installed in 1956. The Timberland and Thorpe fens cover an area of and were enclosed in 1785. An Act of Parliament obtained in 1839 authorised drainage, and the first Timberland pumping station was constructed in that year. A scoop wheel was driven by a beam engine, discharging water into the Witham. A high-pressure condensing beam engine replaced it in 1881, which was coupled to a centrifugal pump. Further upgrades included a Foster tandem horizontal steam engine in 1924 and a Ruston diesel engine in 1938. When the equipment was replaced by electric pumps in 1976, the diesel engine and Gwynnes pump were retained, and are open to the public during the summer. Billinghay South Fen was enclosed in 1777, and covered . The first beam engine, which was manufactured by Green Atkinson, and its scoop wheel, lasted from 1841 until 1935. It was then replaced by two diesel engines with Gwynnes pumps. The building was bombed by enemy aircraft in 1941, during the Second World War, and five members of the Richardson family were killed. Richardson was the engine driver at the time. After the incident many redundant chimneys were demolished, as they were prominent targets for enemy aircraft. By 1977 pumping was performed by two electric-powered pumps manufactured by Allen- Gwynnes. Pumping stations The table shows the locations of the IDB pumping stations, with the number of pumps in 2008, and the maximum pumped flow in megalitres per day (Mld) (1 Mld is 0.233 million gallons per day).

He played college football as a quarterback at Colgate University (1945‚Äì1946) and held coaching positions at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) (head coach, 1955‚Äì1957), Ithaca College (head coach, 1958‚Äì1966), and the United States Military Academy (defensive coordinator, 1967‚Äì1972). He also served as athletic director at RPI from 1972 until his death in 1976. Early years and education Lyon was born in 1924 in Elmira Heights, New York. He attended Thomas A. Edison High School in Elmira, playing baseball, basketball and football before graduating in 1942. After graduating from high school, Lyon attended Syracuse University on a full scholarship and played on the freshman football team in 1942. He then entered the United States Navy and was assigned to the V-12 Navy College Training Program at St. Lawrence University. He was a Navy air cadet for two- and-a-half years. He also played football as an end on the North Carolina Pre- Flight Cloudbusters football team that also included Otto Graham, Spec Sanders, and Frank Aschenbrenner. In 1945, after receiving his discharge from the Navy, Lyon enrolled at Colgate University. He played at the quarterback position for the Colgate Raiders football team and was mentored by that school's legendary football coach, Andy Kerr. He received his bachelor's degree from Colgate in 1947. Lyon next enrolled at Springfield College where he was a graduate assistant football coach under Ossie Solem. Lyon received a master's degree in physical education and science from Springfield in 1950. Coaching and administrative career Lyon began his coaching career as a high school football and basketball coach in Clyde, New York, from 1948 to 1953. His 1949 and 1950 Clyde football teams were unbeaten. He compiled an overall record of 30‚Äì7‚Äì3 at Clyde. He also coached football and basketball at Central High School in Wellsville, New York, from 1953 to 1954. At Wellsville, his football teams compiled a 9‚Äì6‚Äì1 record. In May 1955, Lyon was hired as the head football coach at RPI in Troy, New York. He held that position for three years compiling records of 1‚Äì7 in 1955, 1‚Äì6 in 1956, and 2‚Äì5 in 1957. In May 1958, Lyon was hired as the head football coach at Ithaca College in Ithaca, New York. He was the sixth head football coach at Ithaca College and held the position for nine seasons, from 1958 until 1966. His 1965 team compiled an 8‚Äì0 record, the first undefeated season in school history. Lyon's overall record at Ithaca was 49‚Äì20. Prior to Lyon's arrival, Ithaca had not finished with a winning record in seven years. During Lyon's tenure as head coach, the team never had a losing record. In February 1967, Lyon was hired by the United States Military Academy to serve as defensive coordinator for the Army Cadets football team. In his first season as defensive coordinator, the 1967 Army Cadets compiled an 8‚Äì2 record led by Lyon's defensive unit that ranked seventh nationally out of 118 teams in scoring defense. He remained a member of Army's coaching staff through the 1972 season. Army's defensive performance declined in Lyon's later years with the program, ranking 96th in scoring defense in 1970, 64th in 1971, 113th in 1972. Following the 1972 football season, Lyon left Army and returned to RPI as the school's athletic director. He was also the chairman of RPI's athletic-physical education departments.

History  Saigon seeds were shipped to the United States from Saigon, Cochinchina, in 1902 and planted at the USDA's plant introduction station in Miami, Florida, for observation. Edward Simmonds, the station's director, found the fruit to be of good quality. Saigon trees mostly came true from seed, though there were some variation. This meant that multiple types of Saigon came into existence, and thus the name covers several varieties. Because of the positive qualities of the fruit, Saigon was utilized in Edward Simmonds hybridization experiment, which resulted in a cross between a Saigon and the Indian 'Amini' cultivar. The resulting cross was named 'Samini'. Saigon was also a parent of other mangoes in Florida as well, including the Florigon, whose name is a cross between the words \\"Florida\\" and \\"Saigon\\".

He contributes to various print media such as the Mexico City daily La Jornada and Proceso magazine. He was founder and director of El Telar (\\"The Loom\\"), coordinator of several writing workshops, is a film and television writer, editor of Poes√≠a magazine, a member of the editorial board of Los Universitarios y Cartapacios, the National System of Creators of Art since 1995, and is a professor of literature, aesthetics and screenwriting at Universidad La Salle at Cuernavaca and was director of the now-defunct magazine Ixtus. Biography Sicilia inherited his love of literature and poetry from his father, who was also a poet. An avid reader of Saints Teresa of √Åvila and John of the Cross, Sicilia is a poet whose themes are linked with Catholicism and Christian mysticism. Later he met the Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich, and Sicilia has since become one of the main promoters of Illich's thought among Mexican intellectuals. As a contributor to Proceso and as the editor of the magazine \\"Conspiratio\\", Sicilia writes about various current philosophical, artistic and literary topics. In 2009 he was awarded the Aguascalientes National Award in Poetry, one of the most prestigious honors in Mexican literature. In 2011, TIME Magazine named The Protester as its Person of the Year, and Sicilia was profiled in the accompanying \\"Profiles of Protesters\\" series for his work in organizing the 2011 Mexican protests. In January 2013, he met with Mexican president Enrique Pe√±a Nieto to discuss assistance and memorials for victims of violence in Mexico.

Retrieved 2011-05-08. in Temixco, Morelos, Mexico, by drug gang members. Two of Juan Francisco's friends were assaulted by policemen who were working with the Pac√≠fico Sur drug cartel as muggers. The friends reported the attack, and the attackers turned to the Pac√≠fico Sur cartel for help. On March 27, 8 Pac√≠fico Sur cartel members, including an infamous member named El Pel√≥n, kidnapped the two victims as well as four other friends and Juan Francisco from a bar, murdering the group by suffocation. In response, the poet led protests in Cuernavaca with satellites of support held in numerous other places throughout Mexico. The protesters have called for an end to the Drug War, the retreat of military forces from the streets, the legalization of drugs, and the removal of Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n. Protests have occurred in over 40 Mexican cities, including an estimated 50,000 in Cuernavaca and 20,000 in Mexico City. The rallying cry of \\"Estamos hasta la madre!\\" (\\"We've had it up to here!\\") was used during these protests. On April 3, 2011, Sicilia announced in an open letter \\"To Mexico's Politicians and Criminals\\" a second protest, a \\"National March for Justice and against Impunity,\\" which started on May 5, 2011, in Cuernavaca, Morelos, and arrived on May 8 at the Z√≥calo in Mexico City, Alt URL where over 200,000 people attended. Before the beginning of his speech, Sicilia demanded that the Mexican President retire Genaro Garc√≠a Luna from his post as Secretary of Public Security. A six-point national pact that searches for the social fabric's refounding was read at the same protest. Other related protests occurred the same day in over 31 Mexican cities and 17 cities over the globe.

Barlow studied at Chelsea College of Art (1960‚Äì63) and the Slade School of Art (1963‚Äì66). After joining the staff in the late 1960s, Barlow taught at the Slade School of Art for more than forty years before retiring in 2009 and is now Emerita Professor of Fine Art. Phyllida Barlow has had an important influence on younger generations of artists through her work and long teaching career in London art schools. At the Slade School of Fine Art, her students included Turner Prize- winning and nominated artists Rachel Whiteread and Angela de la Cruz. In 2011 Barlow became a Royal Academician and in 2015 she was made a CBE for her services to the arts in the Queen's New Year Honours. In 2017, Barlow represented Great Britain at the Venice Biennale. Installation view, 'Phyllida Barlow. RIG', Hauser & Wirth, London, England, 2011 Early life and education Although born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England in 1944 (as her psychiatrist father Erasmus Darwin Barlow, a great-grandson of Charles Darwin, was stationed there at the time), Barlow was brought up in a London recovering from the second world war. She studied at Chelsea College of Art (1960‚Äì63) under the tutelage of George Fullard who was to influence Barlow's perception of what sculpture can be. \\"Fullard, among others, was able to impart that the act of making was in itself an adventure. A sculpture that falls over or breaks is just as exciting as one that reveals itself perfectly formed. All the acts of making in the world are there to be plundered and contain within themselves the potential to be transferred to the studio and adapted.\\" Whilst studying at Chelsea, Barlow met her husband, the artist and writer Fabian Benedict Peake, the son of Mervyn Peake, author of Gormenghast. She later attended the Slade School of Fine Art from 1963 to 1966 to further study sculpture. Described by The Independent as \\"a British art dynasty\\" Barlow and her husband have five children together, including the artists Eddie Peake and Florence Peake.Brown, Mark. \\"Leaping around naked in clay, painting her girlfriend's vulva... Meet Florence Peake ‚Äì 'the Lena Dunham of art'\\",The Independent 4 February 2018. Retrieved 3 February 2019  Career  After graduating from Slade School of Art in 1966, Barlow began a forty year long career as a teacher in various institutions, starting with a part-time teaching position in Sculpture at the former West of England College of Art, now known as the University of the West of England, Bristol. While here, she learned traditional techniques of sculpture and discovered and affinity for the malleability of clay. Barlow found an interest in everyday, convenient materials like cardboard, polystyrene, scrim, and cement and how she could create abstracted pieces of work that placed a sense of elevated meaning to them. Forming an environment in which her viewers can reflect on the work and explore the material and processes used to create it was one of her main motivations in her practice. In 2004 she was appointed Professor of Fine Art and Director of Undergraduate Studies at Slade School of Art before retiring from teaching in 2009 at the age of 65, deciding to focus on her own art. She believed that art schools placed too big an emphasis on a particular 'model' of how to be an artist. Barlow's break as an artist came in 2010 when she was shown at the Serpentine. This was followed by representation by Hauser&Wirth.; In 2018 and 2019, Phyllida Barlow was 'provocateur' for the Yorkshire Sculpture international. This is an even which occurs every summer primarily in the galleries of Leeds and Wakefield. It hosts many exhibitions around the museums of Yorkshire, including outdoor spaces such as Yorkshire Sculpture Park and even Leeds city centre. Barlow was responsible to producing a statement to which artists would respond in their sculptural work. Her statement for 2019 reads; ‚ÄòSculpture is an awkward and provocative discipline, constantly and persistently questioning itself. Yorkshire Sculpture International is an imaginative initiative ‚Äì the renowned institutions centred in Leeds and Wakefield, which already constitute an exceptional focus on sculpture, will provide a challenging and inspirational opportunity to give priority to what sculpture is now ‚Äì who it is for, what it is, and where and how it is located. No doubt each institution will reflect different concerns and raise questions around the rich potential of what sculpture can be ‚Äì the more confrontational, surprising, difficult and thought-provoking, the better' - Phyllida Barlow 'Upturnedhouse 2' (2012) by Phyllida Barlow, Timber, plywood, cement, polystyrene, polyfiller, paint and varnish Work Dock by Phyllida Barlow at Tate Britain in 2014Barlow's work is a combination of playful and intimidating. The child like colours she paints her sculptures, almost referencing toys is deeply contrasted with the industrial materials and scale of her works. Her sculptures tower above the viewer as if a huge section of scaffolding. She plays with mass, scale, volume and height which creates a tension to her forms. Her forms give the impression of being both excruciatingly heavy and light as air simultaneously. When in the presence of her sculpture, one looses the sense of object and is entered into an environment. Barlow does not hide her process and material choices from the viewer, she exposes each detail. Best known for her colossal sculptural projects, Barlow uses \\"a distinctive vocabulary of inexpensive materials such as plywood, cardboard, plaster, cement, fabric and paint\\" to create striking sculptures. Drawing on memories of familiar objects from her surroundings, Barlow's practice is grounded in an anti-monumental tradition characterised by her physical experience of handling materials, which she transforms through processes of layering, accumulation and juxtaposition. \\"Obtrusive and invasive, Barlow's large-scale sculptural objects are frequently arranged in complex installations in which mass and volume seem to be at odds with the space around them. Their role is restless and unpredictable: they block, interrupt, intervene, straddle and perch, both dictating and challenging the experience of viewing.\\" Her constructions are often crudely painted in industrial or synthetic colours, resulting in abstract, seemingly unstable forms. Barlow was also a prolific painter, yet even in this field she recognized they were \\"sculptural drawings\\". She painted as part of her curriculum at the Chelsea College of Arts - where she was encouraged to practice by artist and sculptor Henry Moore - and carried on doing so throughout her life as an artist, accruing a vast archive of work. She also has featured in the following publications: Revolution in the Making: Abstract Sculpture by Women, 1947 ‚Äì 2016 by Paul Schimmel and Jenni Sorkin , Phyllida Barlow: Fifty Years of Drawings by Sara Harrison, and Phyllida Barlow: Sculpture 1963 ‚Äì 2015 by Fiona Bradley.  Solo exhibitions  Barlow's work has been presented in solo exhibitions around the world. In 2014, Barlow was commissioned to create new work for the Duveen Galleries at Tate Britain, London, England. After being awarded the Aachener Kunstpreis in 2012, Barlow was commissioned to do a solo exhibition for the Ludwig Forum f√ºr Internationale Kunst in Germany. The exhibition Brink featured seven expansive sculptures creating a \\"stage-like arena\\" for her fictive city. From 3 December 2013 to 24 February 2014, Barlow presented a solo exhibition entitled HOARD at The Norton Museum of Art, West Palm Beach. It was the Norton's third exhibition of RAW - Recognition of Art by Women ‚Äì made possible by the Leonard and Sophie Davis Fund/MLDauray Arts Institute. 2015 saw Barlow's work traveling up to Scotland to be installed in the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh. The exhibition was called 'Set' and consisted of new works which were specifically produced for the show. Her work took over the gallery transforming it into an all consuming environment of bright matter. Her forms undulated through the gallery space with the intension of creating an argument or tension between the two floors of the gallery; \\"The upstairs space shrugging its shoulders at the downstairs space\\" as Barlow herself put it. In 2016, Barlow presented a solo exhibition of new work at the Kunsthalle Zurich. Barlow is one of four artists to be nominated for the inaugural Hepworth prize, the UK's first prize for sculpture, and her work will be on display at the Hepworth Wakefield from October 2016. For the 2017 Venice Biennale, Barlow unveiled her powerfully industrial and bulbous Folly series, which took over both a sanitised indoor space and the idyllic Venetian outdoors. Barlow initially planned for her installation of 41 'baubles' to be hanging from planks that jutted from facade of the pavilion but this vision had to be altered due to expense; they were ultimately displayed in a way that resembled lollipops. Graham Sheffield, the Director Arts at the British Council at the time, wrote that Barlow was selected for her \\"challenging and imposing sculptures\\" which unsurprisingly commanded a distinct and powerful presence at the 57th Biennale. During the course of 2018, Barlow presented three solo shows. Hauser & Wirth curated the exhibition entitled 'tilt', which was held in their New York gallery. In New York she also exhibited with High Line Art, with the show 'prop'. In the UK in 2018 Barlow's show 'Quarry' was held in Edinburgh, Scotland, at Jupiter Artland. In 2019 the Royal Academy (of which she was elected an Academician in 2011) hosted exhibition of a new collection of Barlow's work entitled cultural-de-sac. Her work was situated in the Gabrielle Jungels-Winkler Galleries. The works were a site specific collection of large scale, brutalist sculptures which were created in response to the architecture of the RA building.

A classical liberal by political orientation, Gomes represented Portuguese India in the Cortes Gerais (parliament) from 1861 to 1869. His outstanding contributions towards the fields of classical liberal philosophy and economics led him to be widely hailed as \\"The Prince of Intellectuals\\" in Europe.  Early life  Bust of Francisco Louis Gomes (F.L. Gomes) in Margao, Goa Francisco Lu√≠s Gomes was born on 31 May 1829 in the Colmoroddo vaddo (deanery of a parish) of Navelim village in Salcette, the son of a Goan Catholic Chardo couple, Francisco Salvador Gomes and Deodata Furtado. His father was a physician and civic leader. Gomes spent his early years in Navelim and during this period, displayed a flair for languages. He was a polyglot; highly proficient in the use of Konkani, Portuguese and French, and additionally possessed a good understanding of English, Italian, Spanish, Latin and Marathi. At the age of 21, he completed his medical course at the Escola M√©dico‚ÄìCir√∫rgica de Goa in Panjim. He was soon appointed professor of the institution in view of his academic merits, and also granted a commission in the Portuguese Army. Gomes eventually rose to become the institution's Chief Surgeon in 1860.  Member of Parliament (1861‚Äì1869)  Gomes saw it as his life's mission to advance the cause of freedom, truth and justice, and thus followed in his father's footsteps by taking part in civic affairs. In 1860, he stood for election in the Portuguese parliament Cortes Gerais from the constituency of Margao. He was elected to the parliament in 1861 and took a seat with Partido Regenador (Renewing Party), a liberal party. His first speech in parliament made him renowned as a great orator and parliamentarian. Gomes represented Portuguese India until his death in 1869. He was thrice offered a seat in the Cabinet as a Minister, but declined as he found it to be incompatible with his independent views. Francisco Lu√≠s Gomes fought against slavery and defended the cause of the Padroado. He strove for the creation of a society based on the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity, and campaigned against socio-economic injustices committed on the colonised peoples across the Portuguese Empire. He campaigned to ameliorate the conditions of his constituents and his efforts towards this end succeeded in placing colonial public servants on equal standing as public servants in Portugal. Gomes laid down the principles of a Goan budget and expunged it of several illegal items of expenditure.  Works  Gomes became internationally renowned as an eminent economist and political scientist due to his principal works which were published while he was incumbent in the Cortes Gerais. His view was that economics was inseparable from politics, and as such, he devoted a large part of his life to its study. In 1861, Gomes wrote his first work; a 34-page treatise on the subject in French entitled \\"De la question du cotton en Angleterre et dans les possessions portugaises d' Afrique Occidentale\\" (The issue of cotton in England and the Portuguese possessions of West Africa). This work earned him recognition in Europe as an eminent economist. A second work on the agricultural and rural economy of Goa A liberdade da terra e a economia rural da India portugueza (The freedom of the land and the rural economy of Portuguese India) was published in Portuguese the following year. This work is generally considered to be his magnum opus. In it, Gomes discussed the impact of Portuguese colonial policy on Goan agriculture, as well as the various handicaps of the native agriculturist. He advocated colonial autonomy and a uniform system of colonial administration throughout the Portuguese Empire and suggests a scheme of economic and financial reforms, such as the establishment of Credit societies, which would save the country from economic stagnation. He argued that the comunidades were no longer suited to the exigencies of the time and instead called for the liberation of the lands under their control, and its replacement by individual ownership of the tenant. He also advocated the sale of all public lands, as well as those that belonged to religious institutions. A third work published in French in 1867, Essai sur la th√©orie de l'√©conomie politique et de ses rapports avec la morale et le droit (Essay on the theory of political economy and its relationship with morality and the law) was widely praised by European economists. It is generally recognised as one of the most important in the history of Portuguese economic thought recognised by eminent European societies such as Societe d'Economie Politique of Paris, Society of Medical Sciences of Lisbon and the Economic Society of Cadiz. In 1866, Gomes published his famous historical novel Os Br√¢manes (The Brahmins), the first novel by a Goan,Ben Antao, 'Goan Literature in English', Muse India, 64 (November‚ÄìDecember 2015), http://www.museindia.com/focuscontent.asp?issid=50&id;=4273 . which focused on the practise of caste-based discrimination in India, particularly of untouchability among the Hindus. The novel has a purely Indian background and was inspired by the French playwright Victor Hugo. Its theme is centred on the love of liberty, justice and concern for the downtrodden, and focuses on the life of the Anglo-Indian community in the Faizabad district and its relationship with the native inhabitants. It vividly portrays the traditional festivities in Cawnpore, and discusses the causes and effects of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 in great detail. In it, Gomes also alluded to the anti- colonial uprisings by the Ranes in Goa in the statement: \\"Impartial men who are moved by justice and not by racialism want India to be ruled by Indians\\". He also criticised the European nations for their perceived lack of adherence to Christian values. Gomes' other notable works included a biography written in Portuguese of the brigadiers Henrique Carlos Henriques and Joaquim Xavier Henriques, and in French of Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal (1869). He cherished his mother-tongue, Konkani, and made significant contributions towards a revised edition of Arte da lingoa Canarim (Art of the Canarim language), the Konkani grammar by the 16th-century English Jesuit, Fr. Thomas Stephens. He also wrote an unpublished Konkani grammar dedicated to the Portuguese civil servant and Konkani revivalist Joaquim Heliodor√≥ da Cunha Rivara.  Political views  Gomes was a Romanticist who cherished the concept of liberty. He was a devout Roman Catholic who judged the world according to the ethical standards of his faith, tracing his philosophy of equality to Jesus Christ. Gomes took great pride in his Indian ancestry and advocated the right of Swaraj or self-governance for Indians. On the Indian Rebellion of 1857, he famously stated in Os Br√¢manes: Gomes was a staunch Indian nationalist, and contrarily to his Hindu counterparts within Goa and the Indian mainland, based his nationalism within the framework of his Christian religious beliefs and his faith in the superiority of Western culture. He believed the main instruments of civilisation to be two, namely Christianity and education. He was appalled by the perceived \\"social evils\\" he found to be prevalent in Hindu society, and saw European civilisation as a panacea for them. While Gomes bemoaned the loss of India's ancient cultural heritage, he believed that the only chance left for the Indian people to have a civilisation of their own laid on colonial rule. At the same time, however, he decried attempts by the Western colonial powers to use their dominant status for the purpose of exploiting, rather than guiding and educating their subjects. Gomes further believed that the European colonial powers should eventually leave and entrust the governance of India to its people, once the period of \\"tutelage\\" was over. Gomes envisioned the building of an invincible nation with both Christian and liberal values of an \\"enlightened\\" Europe. He believed that the cause of India's subjugation by European colonial powers laid on India being ridden with rivalries of different dynasties, caste hatred and religious antagonisms. He further believed that with only one religion, only one dynasty, only one caste, India would have been invincible. To this end, he suggested that the British emulate in India the Portuguese example of Christianising Goa in the 16th century, with the exception of resorting to force.  Honours  Gomes was the recipient of numerous honours, in view of his significant contributions in the fields of literature, history, economy and political science. Due to his significant contributions towards the study of political economy, the Society of Economists of Paris appointed him as an Associate Member, a rare honour which he shared with four other eminent personages, namely, William Ewart Gladstone, Mungueti, John Stuart Mill and Richard Cobden. Upon his visit to France on the occasion of the Universal Exhibition held in Paris in 1867, the elite among the French economists and philosophers paid a public tribute to Gomes for his contributions to the study of political economy. The French monarch Napoleon III received him in a special audience and felicitated him for his achievements. Among other honours, Gomes was appointed Member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bombay, Member of the Society of Medical Sciences of Lisbon, Member of the Society of Political Economy of Cadiz, Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon, and was awarded the Doctorate of Social and Political Sciences of the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. His loyalty to the Portuguese Empire coupled with his love and enthusiasm for the Portuguese language and culture resulted in him being honoured with the knighthood of the Ordem Militar de Nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo by the Portuguese government.  Death  In 1869, Gomes was afflicted with a debilitating illness and his body began to waste. He hoped to spend his remaining days in Goa, and left Europe for India by the S.S. Messalia on 25 September. 36 hours after entering the Atlantic Ocean, he died on board the ship on 30 September, aged 40.

Borg was born on 3 November 1990 in Oakville, Ontario as one of seven children, though her family moved to Keswick, Ontario when she was one year old.Profile of Charmaine Borg on CPAC's Beyond Politics She is of Franco- Ontarian and Maltese descent, and is fully bilingual in French and English, though she preferred to speak French on the floor of the House of Commons. Early years After creating a drama program for at-risk youth, she won the Lieutenant Governor's Community Volunteer Award in 2008. At the time of her election, she was a student studying political science and Latin American studies at McGill University and was also working as the Labour Relations Officer for the Association of McGill University Support Employees. She was also co-president of the student New Democratic Party club at McGill University. Entrance to politics She was one of five current McGill students, alongside fellow undergraduates Myl√®ne Freeman, Laurin Liu, and Matthew Dub√©, and graduate student Jamie Nicholls, elected to Parliament in the federal 2011 election following the NDP's unexpected mid-campaign surge in Quebec. She defeated incumbent MP Diane Bourgeois of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois by 49.3 percent to Bourgeois' 30.3 percent‚Äîa margin of over 10,600 votes. By comparison, the NDP had never finished higher than fourth since the riding was created in 1997, and only once had tallied the 10 percent required for their campaign expenses to be refunded. Not only did Borg win a seat in the 2011 election, but that election was the first time she had ever voted in a federal election. She was the third-youngest member of the 41st Parliament, after Liu and Pierre-Luc Dusseault, and one of the youngest women ever elected to Parliament. Borg and Dub√© were co-presidents of NDP McGill (the NDP student group at McGill University) at the time that they both won election to Parliament, and both had spent the campaign working to re-elect Thomas Mulcair in the nearby riding of Outremont. Borg had originally planned to spend the Fall 2011 term as a foreign exchange student in Mexico. After her riding was split almost in half ahead of the 2015 federal election, Borg ran in Terrebonne, essentially the western half of her old riding. She was pushed into third place behind the BQ's Michel Boudrias and Liberal Mich√®le Audette amid the Bloc resurgence in the Laurentides.  In Parliament  In Parliament, Borg was named to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights,Hansard, 9 December 2011 where she intervened against the Conservative government's omnibus crime bill, C-10, and the closure imposed on its debate,\\"D√©fendre la d√©mocratie.\\" CharmaineBorg.info. 18 November 2011. as well as Bill C-30, the Conservative bill on warrantless online surveillance.\\"NDP gears up to fight Conservatives‚Äô snooping law.\\" NDP.ca. 15 September 2011. In the Fall of 2012, Borg embarked on a tour across Eastern Canada and the Maritimes to increase pressure on the Conservative government to abandon the bill. After months of public backlash, the Conservative government finally scrapped Bill C-30 in February 2013. Borg called the death of this bill a \\"great victory and a way forward for politics.\\" In the leadership race following the death of NDP leader Jack Layton, Borg endorsed Brian Topp. On November 12, she was profiled by CPAC's Beyond Politics. Katimavik In 2012, Borg embarked on a cross-country tour to rally support for a Private Member's Motion she presented, M-352, to reinstate Federal funding to the recently cut Katimavik program. =Digital Issues= In April 2012, newly elected NDP leader Thomas Mulcair appointed Borg to the Shadow Cabinet of the Official Opposition. She was given the position of Digital Issues Critic, and became the youngest full critic in the history of Canada. Simultaneously, she was transferred from the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to the Standing Committee on Ethics, Privacy and Access to Information. In one of her first acts as Digital Issues Critic, Borg launched at study at the Ethics, Privacy and Access to Information Committee to investigate the privacy practices of social media companies. During the study's hearings, MPs heard from numerous experts and industry representatives including Facebook, Twitter and Google. =Bill C-475= Following through on the study into social media and privacy, Borg presented Bill C-475 to the House of Commons in February 2013. The bill seeks to amend the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) to introduce mandatory data breach reporting and enforcement powers to the Privacy Commissioner. Bill C-475 has received the endorsements of several privacy and internet experts, along with consumer protection and civil liberties groups. A campaign called \\"My Privacy Online\\" was launched to support the progression of Bill C-475 through the House of Commons. The bill saw its first hour of debate at Second Reading on May 23, 2013, the same day that the Privacy Commissioner of Canada released a position paper calling for similar reforms to PIPEDA. =Bill C-486= In response to calls from youth in her constituency of Terrebonne-Blainville, Borg collaborated with and seconded MP Paul Dewar's Bill C-486 in March 2013. Bill C-486 seeks to end the use of conflict minerals in Canada, particularly those originating in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa.

Nelson, 350 U.S. 497 (1956), was a United States Supreme Court case that established a precedent for the preemption of United States Federal law over State laws. The case was argued November 15‚Äì16, 1955 and the decision was handed down April 2, 1956. The State of Pennsylvania tried to convict a man of sedition under a state law, but a Federal law existed on the same subject. The Court ruled that the Federal law, the Smith Act, overruled the state law, the Pennsylvania Sedition Act, even though the state law was created before the federal law. Nelson, who was convicted under the state law, was therefore mistried.  Background  The Congressional act‚Äôs real name was the Alien Registration Act of 1940, but was referred to as the Smith Act because the anti-sedition section ‚Äì the one Nelson claimed he should have been tried under ‚Äì was authored by Rep. Howard W. Smith of Virginia. The section on sedition read: The State of Pennsylvania tried and convicted Steve Nelson, an acknowledged member of the Communist Party, under the Pennsylvania Sedition Act, sentencing him to twenty years in prison and a $10,000 fine as well as $13,000 for prosecution costs.Nelson, 350 U.S. at 498. The Smith Act was written after the Pennsylvania Sedition Act, but both were created during the Cold War, during the age of Joseph McCarthy and his House Unamerican Activities Committee; this was the time of the \\"Red Scare\\", when McCarthy investigated many people, accusing them of being communists. Other questions on the constitutionality of the Smith Act have been raised in United States Supreme Court, during cases like U.S. v Brandt and Yates v. United States. Even though the act was amended in 1948, it was declared partially unconstitutional in the Yates decision. It has not been repealed. The Case was argued in front of the Warren Court whose members were: Earl Warren; Hugo Black; Stanley Reed; Felix Frankfurter; William O. Douglas; Harold Burton; Tom C. Clark; Sherman Minton; and John Marshall Harlan II. The Constitution of the United States establishes the U.S. Constitution, Federal Statutes, and U.S. Treaties as \\"the supreme law of the land\\". This power, found in Article VI, Clause 2 is known as the Supremacy Clause. The text reads: This means that when federal and state authorities come into conflict, the federal law prevails. This is known as preemption: \\"a situation where a legitimate exercise of national authority supersedes any conflicting action by a state government.\\"Mason, Alpheus T., Stephenson, Donald G., \\"American Constitutional Law\\" Pearson Prentice Hall Publishing, Upper Saddle River, NJ. 2009. p. 731 The Court had to decide whether or not the Pennsylvania law could work concurrently with the Smith Act of the Federal Government.  Opinion of the Court  Petitioner Steve Nelson was convicted under the Pennsylvania Sedition Act, but claimed that the national statute, the Smith Act, preempted his conviction, and the court ruled 6-3 in his favor. The Smith Act of 1940 criminalized sedition against the United States and since the Pennsylvania Sedition Act did essentially the same thing, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the opinion of the court that federal law is preeminent, giving three conditions for Federal preemption: # The scheme of federal regulation is \\"so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement itMason, Alpheus T., Stephenson, Donald G., \\"American Constitutional Law\\" Pearson Prentice Hall Publishing, Upper Saddle River, NJ. 2009. p. 140\\"; # The national interest is so dominant on a subject that the federal system must \\"be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject\\"; # There is a danger of conflict between state and federal enforcement efforts. The presence of these three conditions meant that congress had chosen to \\"occupy the field\\" and thus the states could not regulate within it. The U.S. Supreme Court decided that, because of this preemptive power, the Smith Act trumped the Pennsylvania statute and therefore the Pennsylvania Sedition Act was unenforceable. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote the opinion of the court. The first thing that he stipulates is that, \\"... the decision in this case does not affect the right of States to enforce their sedition laws at times when the Federal Government has not occupied the field and is not protecting the entire country from seditious conduct. ... Nor does it limit the jurisdiction of the States where the Constitution and Congress have specifically given them concurrent jurisdiction ... Neither does it limit the right of the State to protect itself at any time against sabotage or attempted violence of all kinds. Nor does it prevent the State from prosecuting where the same act constitutes both a federal offense and a state offense under the police power, as was done in Fox v. Ohio.\\"Nelson, 350 U.S. at 500. Warren lays out the state‚Äôs power here. In summary: When the federal government has not regulated, the states can act; When the states are granted jurisdiction by congress, the states can act; and finally a state can also act in its defense. Warren enumerates the powers of the Federal Government next with the aforementioned three-part test. The test was derived from Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67. And Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218. The first caveat, whether \\"the scheme of federal regulation [is] so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it\\", is answered by Warren by noting that Congress, besides the Smith act, had issued The Internal Security Act of 1950. Warren said, \\" ... the conclusion is inescapable that Congress has intended to occupy the field of sedition.\\"Nelson, 350 U.S. at 504. The Second caveat states that Federal Statutes must \\"touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system [must] be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.\\" This means that the national interest is so great that it is necessary to have uniform legislation on the subject. Warren emphasizes that Congress made these acts to provide for the common defense, to preserve the sovereignty of the United States as an independent nation, and to guarantee to each State a republican form of government, and that these concerns are in no way a local concern. Thus there is need for uniform, national legislation. Warren finally addressed the third caveat, that there be no conflict between state and national laws. He points out that Franklin D. Roosevelt had revealed this discrepancy in the Pennsylvania law earlier :  Dissent  Justice Stanley Reed wrote the dissenting opinion. Justices Harold Burton and Sherman Minton signed onto the opinion. \\"The 'occupation of the field' argument has been developed by this Court for the Commerce Clause and legislation thereunder to prevent partitioning of this country by locally erected trade barriers\\", wrote Reed, \\"In those cases, this Court has ruled that state legislation is superseded when it conflicts with the comprehensive regulatory scheme and purpose of a federal plan. ‚Ä¶\\" Reed says that in order for federal law to nullify a state law, \\"the conflict should be clear and direct before this Court reads a congressional intent to void state legislation into the federal sedition acts.\\"Nelson, 350 U.S. at 514 (Reed, J., dissenting). Reed argues that Congress has not occupied the field with the smith act, and that it doesn‚Äôt need to, and by doing so is undermining state power. Reed finishes with an emphatic declaration: > The Smith Act appears in Title 18 of the United States Code, which Title > codifies the federal criminal laws. Section 3231 of that Title provides: > Nothing in this title shall be held to take away or impair the jurisdiction > of the courts of the several States under the laws thereof. That declaration > springs from the federal character of our Nation. It recognizes the fact > that maintenance of order and fairness rests primarily with the States. ‚Ä¶ > This Court has interpreted the section to mean that States may provide > concurrent legislation in the absence of explicit congressional intent to > the contrary. Sexton v. California, 189 U.S. 319, 324-325. The majority's > position in this case cannot be reconciled with that clear authorization of > Congress. The law stands against any advocacy of violence to change > established governments. Freedom of speech allows full play to the processes > of reason. The state and national legislative bodies have legislated within > constitutional limits so as to allow the widest participation by the law > enforcement officers of the respective governments. The individual States > were not told that they are powerless to punish local acts of sedition, > nominally directed against the United States. Courts should not interfere. > We would reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.Nelson, > 350 U.S. at 519-20 (Reed, J., dissenting).  References External links * * Pennsylvania v.

Russel Erwood on 19 March 1981 Brislington, Bristol, England) is an entertainer. He currently resides in Conwy with his partner, dancer Foxee Stole. Walker made his name as an escape artist and stuntman but his work also includes being the official jester of Conwy and under his real name he worked as TV magic consultant for Breaking Magic on Discovery Channel and Tricked! on British TV channel ITV2. Over the years Walker has recreated Harry Houdini's most technically challenging escape stunts including the suspended straitjacket escape and the world famous Mirror Handcuff Challenge. Walker broke two world records within the field of escapology and has been voted 6th in the Ten Greatest Escape Artists in History. World records On 29 April 2011 in The Albert Pub, Llandudno, Walker set two new world records for escaping from regulation police handcuffs: * The Most Handcuff Escapes in One Minute: The previous record of six was beaten by Walker setting a new world record of nine handcuff escapes in a single minute. * The Most Handcuff Escapes in One Hour: Walker ~ the Gentleman Escape Artist escaped from 677 pairs of handcuffs in full view without the use of keys within one hour beating the record set by Zdenek Bradac in the Czech Republic in 2010 by 50. Modern mirror handcuff challenge The original Mirror Handcuff Challenge was issued to Harry Houdini in 1904 by the newspaper The London Daily Mirror. In 2008 Walker appeared at the Llandudno Victorian Extravaganza and at the end of the event was challenged by the committee to recreate the feat under the same conditions Houdini faced over 100 years previous. Just as when Houdini performed the original Mirror Cuff Challenge, Walker did not see how the cuffs locked or unlocked, he did not see or handle the key used to secure the restraints, nor were the cuffs removed once they had been locked in place. To do so would have been to accept defeat. Houdini had two advantages over Walker's attempt. The first was that Houdini was able to hide inside a cabinet away from the eyes of the public, Walker had to perform his attempt before an audience of 10000 people. The second advantage is that Houdini had as much time as he wanted. Walker had a strict time limit. Walker was successful and the Extravaganza Challenge Cuffs now form part of his collection of defeated handcuffs and can be seen in all venues he performs in. Suspended straitjacket escape Walker recreated this stunt in the same way that Houdini did it for Fanfarlo's music video The Walls are Coming Down. Suspended by his feet Walker dangled above the band and managed to free himself a total of seven times during just three hours of filming. This stunt was so extreme that Walker left the shoot bleeding from the armpits.

The park was designed by French architect Alfred Agache and founded on September 19, 1935. Near to the Centro Hist√≥rico (Historic Centre), Farroupilha Park is located within a polygon formed by Jos√© Bonif√°cio, Jo√£o Pessoa, Luiz Englert, Setembrina and Osvaldo Aranha Avenues. History The site where the park is located was formerly called V√°rzea do Port√£o, a large flooded lowlands close to the old gate to Porto Alegre. On February 23, 1807, the City Council requested the Governor of the Province, Paulo Jos√© da Silva Gama, to donate the land to be used as public area, as well as a focus area for herds of cattle brought for local supply. However, its measurement would only be effectively carried out between 1820 and 1825. After its donation to the city, it suffered several attempts of alteration of its primary goals, which have always been hindered by the government. During the Ragamuffin War the V√°rzea was outside the city's fortifications, and after the end of the conflict an inspection found several irregularities, such as fences advancing their territory and built a mansion at its center, all was immediately demolished. In the years that followed, government and private individuals tried to split the ground to give it other uses, always finding opposition. In 1870, the Lowland received its first official name, changing its name to Campo do Bonfim, in view of the construction of Capela do Bonfim (Lord Jesus Chapel of the Good End, Chapel Bonfim) on its northern boundary. There were also subsequent threats to the integrity of the area, all frustrated, and in 1872 the President of the Province authorized the construction of a military base in its southeastern limit, being the source of the current Col√©gio Militar de Porto Alegre (Military School of Porto Alegre). The site was also used as a drying area for leather, a meeting place for carts and as a deposit of the municipal waste until mid-1890, in spite of contrary opinions Hygiene of the Board of the Province. In 1884 the street had its name changed toCampos da Reden√ß√£o (Fields of Redemption), celebrating the early abolition of slavery in the city. In 1927, the actual landscaping of the Campos da Reden√ß√£o began, with the implementation of the Jardim Paulo Gama garden to the north and the banning of the parade of carts and herds in 1928. In 1935 for the centenary celebrations of the Revolu√ß√£o Farroupilha (Ragamuffin War), the entire southern part of the field was drained, flushed and urbanized, following the designs of French architect Alfred Agache. This year its name was changed to its current name Parque Farroupilha. Activities roda taking place in Farroupilha Park (2007) Araujo Viana Auditorium Auditorium for concerts, performances and meetings. Designed by architects Moacir Moojen e Carlos Fayet, was inaugurated in March 1964, making it an important space for cultural events.

After World War II the Brazilian Expeditionary Force members who had fought against the Axis on the Italian front returned to Brazil, and the country multiplied in tribute to the GIs and their deeds.

The Surakarta Kraton was established in 1745 by Pakubuwono II. Surakarta Sunanate and Yogyakarta Sultanate are together the successors of Mataram Sultanate. Unlike their counterparts in Yogyakarta, who use the title of sultan, the rulers of Surakarta use the title of sunan. The Dutch name was used during Dutch colonial rule until the 1940s. The title is sometimes anglicized as the , from the location of their palace. History Serimpi dancers, circa 1910 After Sultan Agung I, the power and prestige of Sultanate of Mataram was declining due to a power struggle and conflict of succession within the royal family. The VOC (Dutch East India Company) exploited the power struggle to increase its control on Java, and manage to gain concessions of Mataram's former colony in Priangan and Semarang. The Mataram seat in Plered near Kotagede collapsed after the Trunojoyo revolt in 1677. Sunan Amral (Amangkurat II) relocated the palace to Kartasura. During the reign of Sunan Pakubuwono II, in 1742 Raden Mas Garendi (Sunan Kuning) led Chinese mercenaries and launched a revolt against the crown and also VOC. Raden Mas Garendi was the son of Prince Teposono and also the grandson of Amangkurat II. The rebels managed to take control of the Kartasura capital and ousted Pakubuwono II who fled and sought refuge in Ponorogo. With the help of Adipati Cakraningrat IV the ruler of western Madura, Pakubuwono II regained the capital and cracked down on the rebellion. However the palace of Kartasura was destroyed and considered inauspicious since the bloodbath took place there. Pakubuwono II decided to build a new palace and capital city in Sala (Solo) village. The transfer of the capital to Sala village is commemorated in chandrasengkala (chronogram) \\"Kombuling Pudya Kepyarsihing Nata\\" which corresponds to Wednesday 12 Sura 1670 Javanese year (17 February 1745). The date is considered the day that the Surakarta Sunanate was established. Pakubuwono II faced numerous rebellions, among other from Raden Mas Said, and later from his own younger brother, Prince Mangkubumi who joined Mas Said's rebellion in 1746. Pakubuwono II died from illness in 1749, but before he died, he entrusted the royal affairs of Surakarta to his trusted protector, Baron von Hohendorff, a VOC officer. On behalf of the successor of Pakubuwono II, Pakubuwono III, the VOC manage to broker a peace negotiation with Prince Mangkubumi. The peace deal was reached with Mataram Sultanate being split in two based on the Treaty of Giyanti of 13 February 1755: Yogyakarta Sultanate under the rule of Prince Mangkubumi who was later stylised as Hamengkubuwono I and Surakarta Sunanate under Pakubuwono III.The Surakarta Sunanate today comprises Surakarta, Boyolali Regency, Karanganyar Regency, Klaten Regency, Sragen Regency, Sukoharjo Regency, and Wonogiri Regency, forming the Southern (Kedu) Residency of Central Java. The Giyanti Treaty named Pangeran Mangkubumi as Sultan of Yogyakarta. During the era of Dutch rule, there were recognised two main principalities of Vorstenlanden Mataram, the Surakarta Sunanate and The Yogyakarta Sultanate. Then a few years later Surakarta was divided further with the establishment of the Mangkunegaran Princedom after the Treaty of Salatiga (17 March 1757). The Mangkunegaran Princedom was led by notorious rebel Raden Mas Said who was stylised as Mangkunegara I. The territory of Surakarta Sunanate were reduced much further after the Java War (1825‚Äì1830) led by Prince Diponegoro. Susuhunan Pakubuwono VI was alleged to have secretly supported Diponegoro's rebellion, and as punishment after the Java War the Sunanate was obliged to surrender much of its lands to the Dutch. Throughout the Dutch East Indies era, the Sunanate of Surakarta enjoyed autonomous status under the Vorstenlanden Mataram arrangements.Together with Sultanate of Yogyakarta, the Sunanate of Surakarta was considered as a vassal state of the Dutch Empire under royal patronage of Netherlands crown. The peak of the Surakarta Sunanate's prestige and power were during the reign of Pakubuwono X (1893‚Äì1939) when the Sunan renovated and enlarged the Surakarta palace and construct many infrastructure projects and buildings in Surakarta city. The kingdom faced an era of strife and uncertainty during World War II and the Japanese occupation of Indonesia. After the declaration of independence of the Republic of Indonesia on 17 August 1945, followed by Indonesian National Revolution, the Surakarta Sunanate with Mangkunegaran Princedom sent a letter of confidence to Sukarno to demonstrate their support for the Indonesian Republic. As the reward the Republic awarded the status of Daerah Istimewa (Special Region, similar to today Yogyakarta Sultanate) within the Republic of Indonesia. However, because the political agitation and opposition from Indonesian communists that led to an anti-monarchy movement and rebellion in early 1946, on 16 June 1946 the Indonesian Republic aborted the special region status; both Surakarta's and Mangkunegara's status were reduced to merely a residence and were later merged into Central Java province. In contrast, the Yogyakarta Sultanate has successfully maintained special status. Yogyakarta's historical support and close ties with the founding fathers of the Indonesian Republic during the war of independence and Indonesian national revolution. The Surakarta Sunanate holds no actual political power. Its power is limited to royal prestige and its special position in sustaining traditional Javanese culture. The prestige still remains, that leading many leaders and political figures in Indonesia to seek affiliations with the Sunanate. Residences The principal residence of the sunan is the kraton (palace), sometimes called the Surakarta Kraton or Kraton Solo but otherwise known in formal terms as Karaton Surakarta Hadiningrat. As is the case with a number of other kratons in various cities in Java, the Surakarta Kraton has become quite neglected over the years. Very little funding is available for maintenance, many parts of the palace have been in an advanced states of decay.Ganug Nugroho Adi, 'Falling into disrepair', The Jakarta Post, 12 November 2012.

It was established in 1988 . Core Tex has become a centre for live music, playing host to a string of in-store live events as well as participating in an annual music festival called Myfest.  History  Core Tex Records came into being in 1988, starting off as a small record shop run by punks in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin. With its particular status, West Berlin had long been a refuge for punks, anarchists, pacifists and alternative thinkers. It was a means of escaping military service and offered the ability to pursue alternative lifestyles with more tolerance than in other cities of West Germany. Kreuzberg had a long tradition of squatting, with many of the original squats being in Oranienstrasse. The building in which Core Tex Records is now based is also a former squat. At the same time there was a large number of active members of the punk community forming bands and putting on shows. Many people were also involved in documenting the scene - photographers, fanzine writers and film makers were present, and labels such as Bonzen Records, Heartfirst Records and were creating a musical legacy and history of the Berlin punk and hardcore scene. The formative years of Punk in Berlin have been documented in depth on the \\"Berlin Punk Rock\\" double-album released on Weird System records. In the early 1990s David Strempel - who had played in the punk band Fehlgeburt and hardcore band Charley's War - created the Mad Mob Records label. Tour booking agency M.A.D. organised a show at the SO36 Club in Kreuzberg showcasing the talents of the new generation of Berlin hardcore bands. The show was recorded and released on CD as the first Mad Mob Records release entitled \\"We'll Never Be Tamed\\". Soon afterwards David joined forces with Udo Flutter and Andy Gindullis from Fun Records and they moved into the Core Tex premises on Oranienstrasse. Fusioning these businesses meant that they were a stones throw away from the important spots for the punk scene - the SO36, the Franken bar, Trinkteufel, the Trash Club, Wild At Heart and the Kopi squat.  Live Music Events  With the location established the next logical step was for Core Tex to integrate further with the punk scene. A number of punk booking agencies such as M.A.D., Destiny and Mutti's have their offices in Kreuzberg. As a result, touring bands would frequently have days off in Berlin. Core Tex provided music and beer under one roof and this attracted bands such as Agnostic Front, Sick Of It All and Ignite making frequent visits to the shop whilst on tour.  In-Store Gigs  Having started off with in-store record signings, the store started putting on free concerts during opening hours. These would be either a short warm-up gig by a band playing a show later on in town, for example Kill Your Idols, Chuck Ragan or Jeff Caudill. Other bands would play later on and it may be for a special occasion, such as with Born From Pain, who played the record release show for their album \\"War\\" on Metal Blade records. Other events that took place include Anti-Flag playing a benefit set, encouraging fans to bring food donations which would be given to Berlin homeless via the Berliner Tafel e.V.  20th Birthday Show  In 2008 Core Tex celebrated its 21st birthday by holding a three-day event. This featured live shows from Crushing Caspars, Radio Dead Ones, Anticops, Mad Mags and Make It Count. On the final day Core Tex held an exclusive screening for the then unreleased Troopers DVD.  Mayday Festival Stage  The district of Kreuzberg has long been the centre of protests on the first of May. The traditional Mayday would see a series of demonstrations pass through the districts of Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg and Neukolln. The \\"18 Uhr Demo\\" would normally end in Kreuzberg, with frequent rioting taking place around Kotbusser Tor and Oranienstrasse. Eventually a group of local residents and community business owners came together with the idea of encouraging a more peaceful atmosphere by creating a street festival with stages set up along and around Oranienstrasse providing live music, entertainment, information, as well as food and drink. The Myfest was born out of a desire from a cross-section of the Kreuzberg community - punks, Turkish residents, students, artists, small business owners and young families - to not see their neighbourhood and property destroyed year after year in the cat and mouse games between rioters and police. Core Tex became an active participant, setting up a stage for bands to play as well as providing drinks and selling bowls of chili. The Core Tex stage has since become an integral part of the festival, as well as becoming an event in itself on the Berlin punk music live calendar with bands from all over the world asking to play. The line-up generally features several local bands followed by internationally famous bands before ending the live music with a ska band. After the live music, a DJ would provide further music which would keep several thousand people dancing. The 2007 event was filmed by a camera crew and released as a DVD. In 2009 US streetpunk band The Unseen played under the name of Internal Salvation, as they were playing a show in Berlin that evening and could not be advertised under their real name. = List Of Artists To Play Myfest = *Bad Brians *Born From Pain *The Bottrops *Coldburn *Cro-Mags *Deadline *Done Dying *Empowerment *The Essentials *Final Prayer *Frantic Flintstones *Frontkick *Gorilla Biscuits *The Go Set *The Headlines *Jaya the Cat *Jingo de Lunch *KmpfSprt *Kotzreiz *Kumpelbasis *Lazy Slobs *Oxo 86 *Ohrbooten *Payback *Radio Dead Ones *Razors *Rolando Random *Punishable Act *Samiam *SS-Kaliert *Walter Schreifels *Towerblocks *Troopers *The Unseen *Unavoidable *Walter Schreifels *We Ride  The Record Labels  The record labels came into existence with the release of the live compilation CD. As time went by there came a need to find different platforms to suit the cds and records being released according to genre. Core Tex Records comprises the following labels.  Mad Mob Records  Following the release of the live CD, Mad Mob pursued with the concept of providing a platform for European hardcore bands. These would often benefit from support from M.A.D. booking, for example putting the bands Surface and Disrespect on a prominent Christmas Hardcore Tour. Mad Mob soon started releasing bands from outside Germany. The first international bands to appear on the label were Dead Stoolpigeon (ex-Manlifting Banner) and Feeding The Fire from the Netherlands. Both bands were prominent in the European straight edge scene and promoted communist politics in their lyrics. Mad Mob has since released recordings by bands from France, Portugal, Italy and Poland. = Artists with Releases on Mad Mob Records = *3rd Statement *Alithia *Anticops *Approach To Concrete *Beat Down *Criminal Waste *Dead Stoolpigeon *Disrespect *Elision *Feeding The Fire *Luca Brasi *Mindgrab *Miozan *Plain *The Platoon *Proof *Prophecy Of Rage *Punishable Act *Real *Schizma *Stormcore *Surface *Unwritten Law  Bad Dog Records  Bad Dog records was created as a platform to release records by Berlin oi! punk band Troopers. The label soon started working with other bands and came to international prominence with the release of \\"Molotov\\" by The Bruisers - featuring Al Barr of Dropkick Murphys on vocals. Releases then came with increasing frequency from both German artists and international acts from across the globe. The label has primarily punk out oi! punk bands but has also released cds from Irish folk-punk inspired acts, ska bands and Deutschpunk bands. = Artists with Releases on Bad Dog Records = *Anfall *Auld Corn Brigade *Bierpatrioten *Bonecrusher *Boobie Trap *The Bruisers *The Business *Devil In Disguise *Double Torture *The Forgotten *Frontkick *The Go Set *The Headlines *The Kings Of Nuthin' *Neck *The Negatives *OHL *Radio Dead Ones *Razors *Rejected Youth *Runnin Riot *Sham 69 *The Sir William Hills *The Strikes *Styrian Bootboys *Troopers  Grapes Of Wrath  Grapes Of Wrath records releases international hardcore artists.

These releases were not on any of the above labels. For a while Core Tex also collaborated with New York label Blackout! records, releasing Blackout! titles in Europe. These included records by Sheer Terror, Violent Society, Kill Your Idols and a number of compilations.

The film was based on the 1927 adventure novel Beau Ideal by P. C. Wren, the third novel in a series of five novels based around the same characters. Brenon had directed the first in the series, Beau Geste, which was a very successful silent film in 1926. The screenplay was adapted from Wren's novel by Paul Schofield, who had also written the screenplay for the 1926 Beau Geste, with contributions from Elizabeth Meehan and Marie Halvey. The film starred Ralph Forbes (reprising his role as John Geste from the 1926 Beau Geste), Loretta Young, and Irene Rich. The other lead, Lester Vail, was making his film debut, after he replaced Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., who had originally been selected for a principal role in the film. Exteriors were filmed on locations in Arizona and Mexico, while the interiors were filmed on the RKO lot in Hollywood, and production took approximately five weeks to film. Post production would take place in November and December 1930, before the film was released on January 16, 1931. Unfortunately, the film was neither a critical nor financial success, losing over $300,000 for RKO. In addition, reviews for the film were mixed, with most being not kind to the film. Some modern sources also consider the film to be one of the worst produced by RKO that year. Although the film was not a success, it did introduce two technological advancements to film: the concentrator microphone and the Dunning process. Plot Lester Vail and Ralph Forbes awaiting death in the prison pit Lester Vail & Paul McAllister The last two surviving members of a French Foreign Legion detachment, who know each other as Smith and Brown, are consigned to a grain pit in the desert to die slowly. As they await death the two soldiers eventually realize that they were childhood friends, John Geste (Ralph Forbes) and Otis Madison (Lester Vail), respectively. Once they recognize one another, they have a series of flashbacks to their boyhood friendship in England. These memories are followed by Otis' memory of his return to England and discovery that John has joined the French Foreign Legion. While in England, Otis also learns that Isobel Landon (Loretta Young), who he is enamored with, is betrothed to John. Despite his feelings for her, he vows to follow John to Africa and return him to England. He makes arrangements and leaves for the dark continent. Upon his arrival in Africa, Otis, and his detachment, are ordered to garrison a French fort in the desert. As hardships ensue, his fellow legionnaires begin to mutiny. Otis does not participate in the uprising, instead he attempts to get the other soldiers to cease their rebellion. When the uprising is eventually thwarted, the commanders do not believe Otis' story, and assume that he was part of the rebellion, and send him to a penal detail. While part of that detail, he is again falsely accused, and is thrown into the pit, along with John, which puts them both in the pit where the film begins. Back in the present, as they are about to die, they are miraculously rescued by a passing band of Arabs. Unknown to the two friends is that the Arabs intend to use them as bait to draw their fellow legionnaires into a death trap. Fortunately for the friends, the girlfriend of the Emir, Zuleika (Leni Stengel), also known as \\"the Angel of Death\\", is attracted to Otis. Otis uses that attraction and agrees to marry her, after which Zuleika informs him of an impending attack by the Arabs on the nearby fort, and then helps Otis and John to escape. The two legionnaires race to the fort, and help to repel the Arab attack, which earns both of them their freedom. Otis now has to face up to his commitment to Zuleika. However, she has now transferred her affections to Major LeBaudy (Hale Hamilton), which allows Otis to be relieved of his matrimonial duties. Free from any entanglements, the two friends return to England. Once there, John releases Isobel from their betrothal, which clears the way for her and Otis to marry.

It was based on P. C. Wren's novel of life in the French Foreign Legion. The second book in the series, Beau Sabreur, was made into a film in 1928, starring Gary Cooper, also by Paramount. While Beau Sabreur was unconnected to Beau Geste, having completely different characters, this third film was billed as the sequel to the first film, having many of the same characters. Like the other two films, this movie was based on the Wren novel of the same name, which had been released in 1928.Review of novel. Retrieved September 10, 2014. RKO purchased the rights to the novel in July 1930, and Herbert Brenon, who had directed Beau Geste, became the first person attached to the project. In August it was announced that Ralph Forbes would reprise his role of John Geste, which he had originated in the original film. In the beginning of September it was announced that Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. would have a leading role in the film, on loan from Warner Brothers; also announced to the cast were Ralph Forbes and Leni Stengel. In September 1930, RKO hired an Arab chieftain, Abdeslam ben Mohammed, as a technical consultant for the film. Initial reports also indicated that he would appear in the film, but no sources credit him with appearing. By mid-September, however, Fairbanks, originally scheduled to play the role of Otis Madison, was recalled by Warner Brothers prior to the start of filming, so that he could star in a scheduled sequel to The Dawn Patrol (which was never made). He was replaced by Lester Vail, who was making his screen debut. Vail had a very short-lived career, making a total of only eight films in 1931 and 1932. French Foreign Legion marching through the desert Also in September, it was decided that the film would use the same location as the earlier Geste film, in Yuma, Arizona. Besides the Yuma location, some location filming was done in the Sonora Desert in Mexico, as well as studio work on the RKO lot in Hollywood. Later in September, Otto Matieson, Paul McAllister, Hale Hamilton, and Don Alvarado were announced as joining the cast. Ray Lissner, who was the assistant director on this picture, also wrote the only song in the film, the marching song of the French Foreign Legion, however it appears the song did not appear in the final version of the film. In late September it was announced that Noah Beery, Jr. would be part of the cast, interesting in the fact that his father had been part of the cast of Beau Geste Production on the film began in late September 1930, and would finish in late October. Two new technological improvements were inaugurated in this film. The \\"Dunning Process\\" was used to adapt the film for foreign-language versions. The concentrator microphone was developed by RKO to be used in productions to filter noise in exterior shots, was first used during this film's production. In addition to Brenon directing and Schofield writing both films, J. Roy Hunt was the cinematographer on both the 1926 Beau Geste and this film. Editing for the film was done during November and December 1930 by Brenon. Max Steiner would finish the score for the film by December 22, 1930. Reception Beau Ideal was produced on a budget of $707,000, however the film never caught on with audiences, and ended up losing $330,000 for RKO, in a year when the studio would lose over $5.5 million. While an unmitigated financial disaster, reviews of the film at that time were mixed. Mordaunt Hall, film critic for The New York Times, gave the film a poor review, calling it \\"...scarcely a tribute to the audible screen\\". According to some sources, the film was considered \\"...the most wretched picture turned out by the studio in what was, generally, to be a very poor year.\\" Variety also gave it a less than favorable review, calling it \\"ordinary program stuff.\\" However other reviews were much more favorable, with The Film Daily calling it a \\"Stupendous Foreign Legion production with stout direction and excellent photography\\". They criticized the story as weak, but also praised the acting of the mostly male cast, and singled out Loretta Young's strong performance. And Photoplay magazine called the a \\"spectacular sequel to Beau Geste, and complimented the acting. Status The film was copyrighted in 1930. In 1958, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.

Work  Rosch initially gained recognition with his work in performance art. In the 2005 exhibition, Form/Reform, at Oakland Art Gallery Rosch created a carnival vase breaking game which invited viewers to throw sock balls at a pyramid of ceramic vases causing the objects to fall and shatter. Rosch's work aimed to entertain, a characteristic of Bay area performance art. He was successful in creating art that resonated beyond the initial performance because the remnants of the broken vases left an interesting visual component. Rosch is concerned with developing relationships between his audience and his work. In the 2007 exhibit at Southern Exposure in San Francisco, Rosch invited visitors to create artwork from the materials he provided with suggested ideas including: make a face using three parts, make a still life of some of your best memories as if spread across the table, make a totem for all past present and future. Along with his work in performance and interactive art, Rosch works in two- dimensional forms creating collages. He begins with found objects, magazine spreads, and photographs he complicates adding other images or blocks of color. An example of this is Untitled (River Canyon, Country Countryscape) in which Rosch used a color photograph of a mountain range and placed the image on a black and white photograph of a different mountain range, however he lined up the images so the ridge of one mountain range flows into the other. Rosch's recent work continues to use found photographs and prints of landscapes with cut brown or turquoise paper rectangles placed on the image. These works create a stark contrast between the cut paper and the images beneath and are reminiscent of modern sculpture parks. ‚Äù Rosh uses turquoise as a ‚Äúsymbol of escape‚Äù.

The British immediately killed the American captain David Ropes as a result of the cannon fire. Both ships had numerous holes shot through their sails, and the British sailors attempted to climb the rigging of their ship in an effort to board the American privateer.

The report finds that over the last 30 years poverty has been reduced for most of the world's population - but this is not the case for the estimated 1.5 billion people living in countries blighted by on-going conflict. Not one low income country suffering from on- going violence has achieved a single Millennium Development Goal. Once mass violence takes root in a society, it can take a generation or more to restore stability. Organised violence as defined by the report includes civil and inter-state war as well as the violence resulting from criminal activity, especially drug and human trafficking. The WDR does not address interpersonal and domestic violence, though it acknowledges they are also relevant to development. The report finds that overall mass conflict has become less prevalent over recent decades, with the average number of worldwide battle deaths dropping from 164,000 per year in the 1980s to only 42,000 in the 2000s. But the 1.5 billion living in conflict wracked states have not benefited from this trend. A new form of mass violence plagues their countries, with cycles of political violence alternating with periods where as many or more die from criminal activity. Despite the difficulties in overcoming a legacy of conflict, violence or authoritarian rule, several countries have made impressive progress including Chile, Colombia, Ghana, Indonesia, Mozambique, South Africa and Timor-Leste. The report offers lessons drawn from these past successes. The World Bank stress that their report does not proscribe standard fixes suitable for all, and that efforts to resolve conflicts should be nationally led from within affected countries. Workable solutions will have to be tailored to each set of individual circumstance. Yet the WDR does find that previous successful efforts share many common features, which are reflected in the report's WDR framework. Key Messages Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, a country cited by the report as making good progress in resolving conflict and subsequently in boosting economic growth and reducing poverty. According to World Bank president Robert Zoellick in his forward to the report, the five key messages are: 1) \\"Institutional legitimacy is the key to stability.\\" Institutions must be trusted to deliver if they are to reduce violence and promote peace. Often levels of trust among various stakeholders must be raised before necessary institutional transformation is attempted, and crucial to this end are quick wins ‚àí actions that produce early tangible results. 2) \\"Investing in citizen security, justice, and jobs is essential to reducing violence.\\" The report finds that unemployment is widely considered to be the no 1 reason for youths to join both criminal gangs and contending armies. To address this, the WB states that it will henceforth focus more on promoting job creation. The WDR also acknowledges that existing development agencies do not yet have the capacity to adequately help fragile states build up police forces and justice systems, even though aid in building an army is more readily available. 3) \\"Confronting the challenge effectively\\" requires change. Development agencies including the WB itself have not yet fully adapted to the needs of the 21st century which are very different from those of the 20th. Instead of rebuilding nations devastated by a huge but one off war, they must address cycles of violence typically involving not just political conflict but also criminal activity such as trafficking. Greater speed, collaboration and staying power are needed for these new challenges. Also needed is a willingness to accept greater risk that not all aid efforts will be fruitful, and a greater emphasis on crisis prevention and early de- escalation of violence rather than post crises intervention which can consume vastly more resources. 4) \\"A layered approach\\" is needed. Many issues are best addressed on multiple levels - locally led efforts are essential but they often need to be complemented by national, regional and international action. Collaboration between development and humanitarian organisations, NGOs and TNOs, private sector and grass roots initiatives ‚àí especially women's groups ‚àí are all vital components of the most efficient solutions to the problems being faced. 5) \\"The global landscape is changing.\\" Middle income and regional institutions such as the ANC are now playing a much larger role in shaping global affairs than was the case a few decades ago, which needs to be recognised by those involved in crafting and executing solutions to development problems. See especially p.11‚Äì12 WRD2011 fullPDF The report creation process Although the World Bank produces World Development Reports annually, the 2011 report was two years in the making, written by a team led by World Bank directors Sarah Cliffe and Nigel Roberts. The writing process for the 2011 WDR marked a departure from previous reports, in that consultation was broader and deeper. Consultation extended beyond discussion with the traditional parties ‚àí representatives of OECD donor countries, leading academics, other multilateral and bilateral agencies - to reach out to, among others: leaders from the private sector and civil society; national reformers; local and regional leaders, especially those working in conflict affected countries.The reports states that in particular this included Afghanistan, Colombia, Congo, Haiti, Iraq, Kenya, Mali, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sudan, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu, West Bank and Gaza, and Yemen. To further broaden the discussion process, use was made of new media technologies, including videos, blogs, and Twitter feeds. The actual document was not the sole or final end of the creation process ‚Äì it also sought to foster an ongoing global conversation that will enhance the knowledge and collaborative capabilities of all the different actors working to speed development and resolve conflicts; a dialogue that will continue into the future interacting with everything from the UN's global policy making to the execution of local efforts by grass roots organisations. Rather than merely record the opinion of western experts, the report seeks to distill the world's collective experience and the recommendations of everyone involved in tackling the challenges of development and peace promotion. See especially pp.13‚àí14 and 19‚àí21 WRD2011 fullPDF The WDR framework The WDR framework depicts conflict resolution as a cyclical process where periods of confidence building among stakeholders alternate with the strengthening of legitimate institutions. The WDR framework is a process model showing how countries can break free of cycles of violence by establishing legitimate and effective institutions to promote stability and prosperity. Rather than being a top-down recommendation from the World Bank, the framework reflects the experiences of what worked best for various countries which have already successfully overcame prolonged violence. Case studies showing this are given for Ethiopia, Ghana, Indonesia, Mozambique, Rwanda and many other countries. The two key stages identified are confidence building and institutional transformation. The report details a number of \\"core tools\\" for use during each stage, which have been commonly used by those countries which have successfully resolved their long-running conflicts. To create conditions where attempts at institutional transformation are likely to succeed, various factions with the power to make or break the undertaking need to gain confidence that the transformation will deliver worthwhile results. Two key tactics for building trust are for national governments to deliver early, tangible results that demonstrate a commitment to reform and work through building \\"inclusive enough\\"\\"Inclusive enough\\" means that while its ideal for the coalitions to be all-inclusive, in some cases this won't be feasible, in which case the key is to have sufficient factions join to give reforms a good chance of success. coalitions. After delivering any available \\"quick wins\\", the coalitions build national and local support for peaceful change. Getting previously competing factions to work together often requires signals of a clean and irreversible break with the past. Once sufficient trust has been built up to attempt institutional transformation, the first priority is to increase the capability of institutions to provide security, justice and jobs. As experience has shown there is a limit to how much change a society can absorb at one go, it is rarely advisable to attempt a \\"big bang\\" transformation that will achieve everything at once. Rather a \\"virtuous cycle\\" seems to work best, with alternating periods of confidence building and institutional transformation. Both the key stages should be nationally led, but the framework encourages international agencies to provide much needed support, and to help guard the process from being derailed by external stress. The WDR says the cycle can often take a generation to reach the end goal, which will involve the formation of stable, legitimate institutions able to support a satisfactory standard of citizen security, justice and jobs.Passim but see especially chapter 3, WRD2011 fullPDF Synopsis As of April 2011 the report had been published in two versions: a 65-page overview and a 352-page full version. The full version includes a forward, an acknowledgments, a notes section, a glossary, the overview, and three main parts sub-divided into a total of nine chapters. Part 1: The ChallengeChapter 1: Repeated violence threatens development= The opening chapter reviews evidence suggesting that repeated cycles of civil conflict and criminal violence are a major factor retarding development in the countries and regions they afflict. The chapter highlights the devastating effect mass violence has on the over 1.5 billion living in countries severely affected by it. The WDR also summarises progress made in reducing war and battle deaths, showing how countries such as Ethiopia, Rwanda and Mozambique were able to make very rapid development progress once mass violence had been alleviated. =Chapter 2: Vulnerability to violence,= Chapter two discusses the role played by external and internal stresses in triggering mass violence. A case is made arguing that a critical reason why some societies are more vulnerable than others to outbreaks of violence is the lack of quality institutions able to reconcile competing factions and peacefully address grievances held by sectors of the populations. The WDR argues that while elite pacts between rival leaders can deliver short term peace, violence generally soon reoccurs unless stability can be reinforced by impersonal institutions and good governance. Part 2: Lessons from national and international bodiesChapter 3: From violence to resilience: Restoring confidence and transforming institutions= This chapter introduces the WDR framework. =Chapter 4: Restoring confidence: Moving away from the brink= Ghanaian diplomat and former head of the UN, Kofi Annan. Successful efforts within Ghana to overcome violence are discussed in chp 4. Chapter four focuses on the ways previous efforts have successfully built trust as a prelude to instuitional transformation in countries such as Chile and Indonesia. Both case studies and previous academic work are used to show that while it is important to build \\"inclusive enough\\" coalitions for positive change, they need not be all-inclusive, especially at the early stages of the process. Signaling a clean break with the past is also emphasised as important, as is the early delivery of tangible results. The WDR shows that national leaders driving the process often enlist help from non state actors ‚Äì from both the civil and international sector. =Chapter 5: Transforming institutions to deliver security, justice, and jobs= Chapter 5 is about the institutional reforms which can deliver security, justice and jobs for citizens in conflict wracked countries. The WDR emphasises that it is often essential to avoid becoming stuck trying to implement \\"perfect\\" reforms; instead early efforts should focus on pragmatic \\"best fit\\" solutions. Two other dimensions considered are the pace and prioritisation of reforms. Case studies such as the reforms initiated in China by Deng Xiaoping are presented to support the case that a gradual pace, with progressive transformations taking place over a generation, is most likely to succeed. The WDR advises that early efforts should be prioritised towards reforms that deliver citizen security, justice and jobs. While it offers numerous specific practical suggestions, the report emphasises that the best choices for each individual country should be assessed on a case by case bases by the national reform leaders. =Chapter 6: International support to building confidence and transforming institutions= The WDR argues that building confidence and transforming institutions should be a nationally led process, but that international support is also often needed. The report finds that though international support has sometimes been a key factor in successful reform efforts, as was the case in Colombia and Mozambique, it is often inadequate. This chapter shows that various international actors typically lack the capability to provide meaningful support on their own, but also are often pulled in different directions by their own domestic pressures. Excessive fear of risk taking often leads to initiatives that have a high but still uncertain chance of delivering highly beneficial returns being passed over in favour of much less effective efforts which are chosen for their minimal risk. These and other factors prevent international actors combining their efforts to best effect. Other issues identified with international support are at excessive emphasis on post-conflict support as opposed to prevention, and a lack of capability for supporting job creation. =Chapter 7: International action to mitigate external stresses= Lake Malawi in the Great lakes region of Africa. Chp. 7 contains a case study showing how regional cooperation involving 7 neighboring countries was crucial to reducing the conflict that raged in this area from 2002 to 2009. External threats aggravating violence in fragile states often include trafficking, outside political influences favouring particular groups within a country, as well as food or water insecurity and other economic shocks. This chapter reviews how regional and international actors can help countries address these stresses. The WDR emphasises that certain cross border threats are best dealt with at regional level, providing cases studies to show how this has been successfully accomplished. Part 3: Reducing the Risks of Violence‚ÄîDirections for International PolicyChapter 8: Practical country directions and options= Chapter 8 is addressed to both government and civil society strategic decision makers within affected countries who are trying to reduce organised criminal and political violence. It draws together some of the concepts from earlier chapters and provides insights from successful transitions in countries including South Africa and Colombia. =Chapter 9: New directions for international support= This chapter suggests new directions for international policy and institutions. The report notes how the trans national organisations set up after WWII achieved considerable success in reducing the number of wars, and that after the cold war ended new tools were developed which successfully reduced the number of civil wars. But comparable tools are not yet in place for dealing with the 21st century forms of mass violence, where some countries have suffered more deaths from organised criminal violence than they did while being ravaged by a traditional war. The final chapter discusses how this shortfall in international capability can be rectified. Reception The NGO International Alert which specialises in addressing violence hailed the report as a \\"game changer\\". They write it is a \\"tremendously important\\" signal that the World Bank has so strongly acknowledged how critical it is for legitimate institutions to be in place which can resolve conflict by non-violent means. While International Alert predict the report will become a seminal work, they admit there is a risk some will merely praise it and then consign the report to the book shelf. Some of the early press coverage merely summarised the report, picking out example case studies, without assessing the report's accuracy or likely impact. Media based in countries near to centres of violence have tended to focus on the reports findings for their immediate region. Commenting on a draft version of the report, the New York Times noted how the World Bank blamed its own lack of flexibility for slow progress in East Timor. While broadly welcoming the report, Jonathan Glennie for The Guardian regrets that there was no mention of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Martin Wolf writing for the Financial Times opines that the report is too long to obtain the attention it deserves. He summarises what he considers to be the most important messages of the report and urges his readers to assist with efforts to reduce organised violence.

History On 27 October 1480 Botticelli, together with other Florentine painters, left for Rome, where he had been called as part of the reconciliation project between Lorenzo de' Medici, the de facto ruler of Florence, and Pope Sixtus IV. The Florentines started to work in the Sistine Chapel as early as spring 1481, along with Pietro Perugino, who was already there. The theme of the decoration was a parallel between the lives of Moses and Christ, as a sign of continuity between the Old and the New Testament. A continuity also between Mosaic Law and the message of Jesus, who in turn chose Peter (the first bishop of Rome) as his successor; the latter's successors were the popes of Rome. Botticelli painted three scenes, helped by numerous assistants. On 17 February 1482 his contract was renewed, including the other scenes to complete the chapel's decoration. However, on the 20th of the same month, his father died: he returned to Florence, where he remained. Description The painting depicts three episodes and tells of a rebellion by the Israelites against Moses and Aaron. On the right the rebels attempt to stone Moses after becoming disenchanted by their trials on their emigration from Egypt. Joshua has placed himself between the rebels and Moses, protecting him from the stoning. The center scene shows the rebellion with Korah and the conspirators being driven out by Moses and Aaron, as high priest wearing the papal tiara. To the left, the ground opens and the two principal conspirators sink into it. The children of Korah are spared the fate of their father. The painting is framed by golden faux-architecture with an inscribed titulus above. The texts attached to the paintings of the Sistine Chapel inform the educated congregants in the papal chapel of the subject matter of the paintings; the tituli work to reveal both the identity of the figures, the content of the scenes with the Biblical narratives, and their exegesis. In the background of the painting is a Roman triumphal arch modelled closely on the Arch of Constantine, from the late antique period, which also included elements of earlier imperial monuments. The real Arch of Constantine's inscription is replaced by a cautionary inscription paraphrased from the Vulgate translation of Hebrews 5:4: (And no man taketh this honour [the priesthood] unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. ‚Äì ) The intended message of the painting is clear, no one should doubt the authority of the Pope over the Church. The power of the papacy was constantly being questioned at the time  Notes  :1.or Core in Latin and some English translations.

Founded in 1948, the Southern California Grotto, is one of the oldest chapters of the NSS and is one of the largest grottos in the western United States. The Southern California Grotto has a long history of active caving and cave related projects throughout California and other states, and extending to other areas of the world. Members of the Grotto endorse the goals of the National Speleological Society ‚Äì the study, exploration, and conservation of caves. The motto: \\"Take nothing but pictures. Leave nothing but footprints. Kill nothing but time.\\" summarizes the ideals practiced by Southern California Grotto cavers while exploring the underground world.  History  William Halliday organized the first meeting of the Southern California Grotto on September 29, 1948, at Huntington Memorial Hospital, where he was working as an intern. Twenty prospective members attended the first meeting and of these, five were members of the National Speleological Society: Denny Constantine worked at the Los Angeles County Museum and is now known for his expertise in bat species. Karl Heinize was an astronaut who died on a climbing expedition to Mount Everest. Richard Logan was a professor of geography at the University of California. George Neuerburg was an expert in hard rock mining. On December 10, 1948, the Southern California Grotto was chartered as the sixteenth grotto of the NSS and the first grotto in California. However, the official charter was not issued until July 1, 1958 and it listed the Southern California Grotto as being active since January 31, 1949. Bill Halliday was the first grotto chair and meetings at the Pasadena Public Library Auditorium started in November 1948. During the first year, grotto membership increased from 8 to 34. Also in that first year, the grotto had 13 official trips to caves in California, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. The first grotto trip was to Lilburn Cave on October 2‚Äì3, 1948. Kokoweef Cave was the second grotto trip in November 1948.  Cave conservation  Members of the SoCal Grotto volunteer on conservation projects each year. Work is done California, the western United States, and in international projects. In California, the grotto assists state and federal agencies such as Providence Mountains State Recreation Area, Sequoia, Kings Canyon, Death Valley National Parks, and the Mojave National Preserve.  Cave research  Members of the grotto participate in a number of research projects as both principal investigators, and as field assistants. Current projects include the Earth- Mars Cave Detection Expedition, in the Mojave Desert, several projects at Cathedral and other caves in Arizona, and the XMET project in Belize.  Media  The SoCal Grotto has assisted media companies in Hollywood, as it is the closest caving organization and members have consulted on a number of feature films, documentaries, TV shows, news programs, and newspapers.

It was formed on 7 December 2007 by King Abdullah. At the time of its formation, the Council's intended function was to appoint a Crown Prince once a new King succeeds to the throne. History Previously, under Chapter 2 of the Basic Law promulgated by King Fahd, the appointment of the next in line was the sole prerogative of the King: The appointment of a successor by the King was usually done with some form of informal consensus among members of the royal family. However, after Prince Abdullah succeeded Fahd as King, the behind-the-scenes battles over the future of the monarchy intensified, particularly between Prince Abdullah and the Sudairi princes, including Prince Sultan and late Prince Nayef. Due to increasing uncertainty of succession beyond Prince Sultan, King Abdullah issued the Allegiance Institution Law in 2006, which formally established the Allegiance Council. The Council gave additional voice to members of the Al Saud family when a new King selects his Crown Prince. According to an October 2009 diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, the Al Saud family described the Council as a \\"codification of the unwritten rules that have governed the selection of Saudi rulers since the passing of King Abdulaziz in 1953.\\" The role of the Council was intended to take effect once the late Prince Sultan succeeded to the throne. However, in 2009, when he was gravely ill with cancer, the late Prince Nayef was appointed Second Deputy Prime Minister (a position for the crown prince in waiting), presumably to keep the position of Crown Prince within the Sudairi faction. This led to uncertainty over the role of the Council. The appointment of Prince Nayef was openly questioned by Prince Talal. The Council supposedly undertook its duties for the first time when Prince Sultan died in October 2011. One week after his death, King Abdullah announced that the Council had selected Prince Nayef as the new Crown Prince. However, the Council just swore allegiance to Nayef as Crown Prince. Whether it actually voted on the selection remained unclear. Similar apparent dysfunctionality of the council was also observed in regard to the appointment of Prince Salman as Crown Prince in June 2012. Prince Talal stated that the princes on the Council were not consulted on the succession of Prince Salman and that the Council became ineffective. When King Abdullah died in 2015, Salman became king and Prince Muqrin, the youngest surviving half brother, became Crown prince automatically, having been appointed Deputy Crown Prince a year earlier. Role Under the Allegiance Institution Law, the King nominates up to three candidates for the position of Crown Prince. The Allegiance Council then selects one of them as Crown Prince. If the Council rejects all of the King's nominees, it may nominate its own candidate. The Crown Prince will be then decided by a vote among the Council: The Council also preempts the possibility of the King becoming incapacitated. In the event the King permanently loses his ability to exercise his powers, the Council will declare the Crown Prince as King. If both the King and the Crown Prince become permanently incapacitated, the Council will form a five-member Transitory Ruling Council to temporarily assume administration of the Kingdom. The Council will also select a new King within seven days. Despite all these detailed legal description, the Council has never been activated and was not active in the appointments of the crown princes; in 2011, namely Prince Nayef and in 2012, namely Prince Salman. The foundation of the Council was seen as way to diminish the influence of the Sudairi brothers, who could be easily outvoted in the Council. Despite this, the Sudairis are said to have influence over more than half the council members. Influence of the Council With the promotion of Crown Prince Sultan's three successors deemed automatic, and the King's writ on the subject of the appointment of the second deputy PM (the honorific \\"deputy crown prince\\" being much more recent than the position itself), the Council has proved to be little more than a \\"rubber stamp\\". After almost a year with the post of second deputy Prime Minister vacant. Prince Muqrin was formally designated by royal decree in 2013. This meant that he was informally next in line, bypassing several senior princes. In order to make his place in the line of succession permanent and preclude any challenges by any of the dispossessed royals, King Abdullah polled each member of the Allegiance Council individually before announcing Maqrin's new title. The poll, which is considered an official vote, was 75% Yes and 25% No. The royal decree stated that the election ‚Äúmay not be modified or changed in any way or form by any person whoever it may be‚Äù, precluding a King Salman from capriciously choosing someone else, which is exactly what would happen three months into the new reign. Upon the death of King Abdullah, Prince Muqrin became Crown Prince automatically, and Salman decreed that his full nephew Muhammed bin Nayef become the first of his generation to be in the line of succession, the Council ratified this a few days later unanimously, confirming its position as a rubber stamp. At the end of April 2015, barely three months into his reign, King Salman dismissed Prince Muqrin from his post as Crown Prince after the approval of the Allegiance Council which voted to declare Prince Mohammed bin Salman as the new Deputy Crown Prince. Membership The members of the council include surviving sons of Ibn Saud, grandsons whose fathers are deceased, incapacitated or unwilling to assume the throne and the sons of the King and Crown Prince. As of 2019 the council had 34 members: 4 surviving sons of Ibn Saud, 29 of his grandsons and 1 of his great grandsons. Each grandson represents his deceased or incapacitated father. However, the line of Hamoud bin Ibn Saud is not represented in the Council, since he died without a son. One of King Ibn Saud's sons, Prince Fawwaz, was a member at the Council, but died in 2008 without sons. Grandson of Turki (I), Turki bin Faisal, died on 28 February 2009 and was replaced by his brother, Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki until his death in 2019.SPA Bandar bin Musaid also replaced his brother, Abdullah bin Musaid. Prince Talal resigned from the Council three weeks after the appointment of Prince Nayef as Crown Prince in November 2011. His resignation meant one of his sons might take a position on the Council, in the future. In December 2011, Saud bin Nayef was appointed as a member of the Council since his father, late Prince Nayef could not have a seat in the Council due to being then crown prince. The Council was chaired by Prince Mishaal, who had been excluded from the line of succession, until his death in 2017. Members of the Council swear an oath of allegiance to the King. ;Sons of King Abdul-Aziz *Prince Abdul Ilah *Prince Mamdouh *Prince Mashhur *Prince Muqrin ;Grandsons of King Abdul-Aziz *Prince Bandar (son of King Saud) *Prince Khalid bin Faisal (son of King Faisal) *Prince Badr bin Muhammad (son of Prince Muhammad) *Prince Muhammad bin Nasser (son of Prince Nasser) *Prince Faisal bin Khalid (son of King Khalid) *Prince Muhammad bin Saad (son of Prince Saad) *Prince Muhammad bin Fahd (son of King Fahd) *Prince Talal bin Mansour (son of Prince Mansour) *Prince Faisal bin Bandar (son of Prince Bandar) *Prince Bandar bin Musa'id (son of Prince Musa'id) *Prince Khalid bin Abdullah (son of King Abdullah) *Prince Khalid bin Sultan (son of Prince Sultan) *Prince Saud bin Abdul Muhsin (son of Prince Abdul Muhsin) *Prince Abdulaziz bin Mishaal (son of Prince Mishaal) *Prince Mansour bin Mutaib (son of Prince Mutaib) *Prince Turki bin Abdulrahman (son of Prince Abdulrahman) *Prince Khaled bin Talal (son of Prince Talal) *Prince Abdulaziz bin Nawaaf (son of Prince Nawwaf) *Prince Muhammad bin Mishari (son of Prince Mishari) *Prince Saud bin Nayef (son of Prince Nayef) *Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (son of King Salman) *Prince Fahad bin Turki (son of Prince Turki) *Prince Fahd bin Badr (son of Prince Badr) *Prince Faisal bin Thamir (son of Prince Thamir) *Prince Mishaal bin Majid (son of Prince Majid) *Prince Abdulaziz bin Sattam (son of Prince Sattam) *Prince Faisal bin Abdul Majeed (son of Prince Abdul Majeed) *Prince Abdulaziz bin Hathloul (son of Prince Hathloul) *Prince Nayef bin Ahmed (son of Prince Ahmed who is still alive) ;Great Grandsons of King Abdul-Aziz *Prince Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki (grandson of Turki I of Nejd and Hejaz) In June 2017, 31 out of 34 members approved the selection of Mohammad bin Salman as Crown Prince.

He also launched Get Tech, a Web-based, interactive program co-sponsored by the US Department of Commerce and designed to encourage young people to use technology and to see manufacturing as a technology-based industry Jasinowski served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Association of Manufacturers from 1990-2004. The Manufacturing Institute, founded in 1990, is the 501(c)(3) affiliate of the National Association of Manufacturers. While serving as President and CEO, Jasinowski helped to raise visibility of NAM, transforming the organization into the leading voice for the industry; galvanized the leadership around a common theme of productivity and economic growth, resulting in unprecedented cohesion and significant increase in membership. Jasinowski achieved best in class business development activities, including the launch of a small and medium-sized manufacturers initiative to ensure these sectors were fully engaged in NAM‚Äôs policies and priorities; the growth of non-dues revenue services; expanding NAM‚Äôs telemarketing capability; and the creation of a stronger field sales force. Jasinowski transformed advocacy operations by building diverse coalitions that included the creation of a state-by-state grassroots lobbying effort, which strengthened NAM‚Äôs capacity to secure beneficial legislation for the industry at state and federal levels. He led an industry effort to secure landmark legislation affecting trade, taxes, and other issues for the manufacturing sector, including the passage of the US Trade Promotion and Authority Act (2002) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (1994). Jasinowski is recognized as an expert on manufacturing and other economic issues. His letters have appeared in the New York Times. Jasinowski is a popular speaker and frequent guest on TV programs such as CNBC, Bloomberg and Fox Business.

Along with Justesen codes, expander codes are of particular interest since they have a constant positive rate, a constant positive relative distance, and a constant alphabet size. In fact, the alphabet contains only two elements, so expander codes belong to the class of binary codes. Furthermore, expander codes can be both encoded and decoded in time proportional to the block length of the code. Expander codes In coding theory, an expander code is a [n,n-m]_2\\\\, linear block code whose parity check matrix is the adjacency matrix of a bipartite expander graph. These codes have good relative distance 2(1-\\\\varepsilon)\\\\gamma\\\\,, where \\\\varepsilon\\\\, and \\\\gamma\\\\, are properties of the expander graph as defined later), rate \\\\left(1-\\\\tfrac{m}{n}\\\\right)\\\\,, and decodability (algorithms of running time O(n)\\\\, exist). Definition Consider a bipartite graph G(L,R,E)\\\\,, where L\\\\, and R\\\\, are the vertex sets and E\\\\, is the set of edges connecting vertices in L\\\\, to vertices of R\\\\,. Suppose every vertex in L\\\\, has degree d\\\\, (the graph is d\\\\,-left-regular), L=n\\\\,, and R=m\\\\,, m < n\\\\,. Then G\\\\, is a (n, m, d, \\\\gamma, \\\\alpha)\\\\, expander graph if every small enough subset S \\\\subset L\\\\,, S \\\\leq \\\\gamma n\\\\, has the property that S\\\\, has at least d\\\\alphaS\\\\, distinct neighbors in R\\\\,. Note that this holds trivially for \\\\gamma \\\\leq \\\\tfrac{1}{n}\\\\,. When \\\\tfrac{1}{n} < \\\\gamma \\\\leq 1\\\\, and \\\\alpha = 1 - \\\\varepsilon\\\\, for a constant \\\\varepsilon\\\\,, we say that G\\\\, is a lossless expander. Since G\\\\, is a bipartite graph, we may consider its n \\\\times m\\\\, adjacency matrix. Then the linear code C\\\\, generated by viewing the transpose of this matrix as a parity check matrix is an expander code. It has been shown that nontrivial lossless expander graphs exist. Moreover, we can explicitly construct them. Rate The rate of C\\\\, is its dimension divided by its block length. In this case, the parity check matrix has size m \\\\times n\\\\,, and hence C\\\\, has dimension at least (n-m)/n = 1 - \\\\tfrac{m}{n}\\\\,. Distance Suppose \\\\varepsilon < \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\,. Then the distance of a (n, m, d, \\\\gamma, 1-\\\\varepsilon)\\\\, expander code C\\\\, is at least 2(1-\\\\varepsilon)\\\\gamma n\\\\,. Proof Note that we can consider every codeword c\\\\, in C\\\\, as a subset of vertices S \\\\subset L\\\\,, by saying that vertex v_i \\\\in S\\\\, if and only if the i\\\\,th index of the codeword is a 1. Then c\\\\, is a codeword iff every vertex v \\\\in R\\\\, is adjacent to an even number of vertices in S\\\\,. (In order to be a codeword, cP = 0\\\\,, where P\\\\, is the parity check matrix. Then, each vertex in R\\\\, corresponds to each column of P\\\\,. Matrix multiplication over \\\\text{GF}(2) = {0,1}\\\\, then gives the desired result.) So, if a vertex v \\\\in R\\\\, is adjacent to a single vertex in S\\\\,, we know immediately that c\\\\, is not a codeword. Let N(S)\\\\, denote the neighbors in R\\\\, of S\\\\,, and U(S)\\\\, denote those neighbors of S\\\\, which are unique, i.e., adjacent to a single vertex of S\\\\,. = Lemma 1 = For every S \\\\subset L\\\\, of size S \\\\leq \\\\gamma n\\\\,, dS \\\\geq N(S) \\\\geq U(S) \\\\geq d(1-2\\\\varepsilon)S\\\\,. = Proof = Trivially, N(S) \\\\geq U(S)\\\\,, since v \\\\in U(S)\\\\, implies v \\\\in N(S)\\\\,. N(S) \\\\leq dS\\\\, follows since the degree of every vertex in S\\\\, is d\\\\,. By the expansion property of the graph, there must be a set of d(1-\\\\varepsilon)S\\\\, edges which go to distinct vertices. The remaining d\\\\varepsilonS\\\\, edges make at most d\\\\varepsilonS\\\\, neighbors not unique, so U(S) \\\\geq d(1-\\\\varepsilon)S - d\\\\varepsilonS = d(1-2\\\\varepsilon)S\\\\,. = Corollary = Every sufficiently small S\\\\, has a unique neighbor. This follows since \\\\varepsilon < \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\,. = Lemma 2 = Every subset T \\\\subset L\\\\, with T < 2(1-\\\\varepsilon)\\\\gamma n\\\\, has a unique neighbor. = Proof = Lemma 1 proves the case T \\\\leq \\\\gamma n\\\\,, so suppose 2(1-\\\\varepsilon)\\\\gamma n > T > \\\\gamma n\\\\,. Let S \\\\subset T\\\\, such that S = \\\\gamma n\\\\,. By Lemma 1, we know that U(S) \\\\geq d(1-2\\\\varepsilon)S\\\\,. Then a vertex v \\\\in U(S)\\\\, is in U(T)\\\\, iff v otin N(T \\\\setminus S)\\\\,, and we know that T \\\\setminus S \\\\leq 2(1-\\\\varepsilon)\\\\gamma n - \\\\gamma n = (1-2\\\\varepsilon)\\\\gamma n\\\\,, so by the first part of Lemma 1, we know N(T \\\\setminus S) \\\\leq d(1-2\\\\varepsilon)\\\\gamma n\\\\,. Since \\\\varepsilon < \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\,, U(T) \\\\geq U(S) \\\\setminus N(T \\\\setminus S) \\\\geq U(S) - N(T \\\\setminus S) > 0\\\\,, and hence U(T)\\\\, is not empty. = Corollary = Note that if a T \\\\subset L\\\\, has at least 1 unique neighbor, i.e. U(T) > 0\\\\,, then the corresponding word c\\\\, corresponding to T\\\\, cannot be a codeword, as it will not multiply to the all zeros vector by the parity check matrix. By the previous argument, c \\\\in C \\\\implies wt(c) \\\\geq 2(1-\\\\varepsilon)\\\\gamma n\\\\,. Since C\\\\, is linear, we conclude that C\\\\, has distance at least 2(1-\\\\varepsilon)\\\\gamma n\\\\,. Encoding The encoding time for an expander code is upper bounded by that of a general linear code - O(n^2)\\\\, by matrix multiplication. A result due to Spielman shows that encoding is possible in O(n)\\\\, time. Decoding Decoding of expander codes is possible in O(n)\\\\, time when \\\\varepsilon < \\\\tfrac{1}{4}\\\\, using the following algorithm. Let v_i\\\\, be the vertex of L\\\\, that corresponds to the i\\\\,th index in the codewords of C\\\\,. Let y \\\\in {0,1}^n\\\\, be a received word, and V(y) = {v_i \\\\mid \\\\text{the } i^{\\\\text{th}} \\\\text{ position of } y \\\\text{ is a } 1}\\\\,. Let e(i)\\\\, be {v \\\\in R \\\\mid v_i \\\\in N(v) \\\\text{ and } N(v) \\\\cap V(y) \\\\text{ is even}}\\\\,, and o(i)\\\\, be {v \\\\in R \\\\mid v_i \\\\in N(v) \\\\text{ and } N(v) \\\\cap V(y) \\\\text{ is odd}}\\\\,. Then consider the greedy algorithm: \\\\---- Input: received word y\\\\,. initialize y' to y while there is a v in R adjacent to an odd number of vertices in V(y') if there is an i such that o(i) > e(i) flip entry i in y' else fail Output: fail, or modified codeword y'\\\\,. \\\\----  Proof  We show first the correctness of the algorithm, and then examine its running time. = Correctness = We must show that the algorithm terminates with the correct codeword when the received codeword is within half the code's distance of the original codeword. Let the set of corrupt variables be S\\\\,, s = S\\\\,, and the set of unsatisfied (adjacent to an odd number of vertices) vertices in R\\\\, be c\\\\,. The following lemma will prove useful.  Lemma 3  If 0 < s < \\\\gamma n\\\\,, then there is a v_i\\\\, with o(i) > e(i)\\\\,.  Proof  By Lemma 1, we know that U(S) \\\\geq d(1-2\\\\varepsilon)s\\\\,. So an average vertex has at least d(1-2\\\\varepsilon) > d/2\\\\, unique neighbors (recall unique neighbors are unsatisfied and hence contribute to o(i)\\\\,), since \\\\varepsilon < \\\\tfrac{1}{4}\\\\,, and thus there is a vertex v_i\\\\, with o(i) > e(i)\\\\,. So, if we have not yet reached a codeword, then there will always be some vertex to flip. Next, we show that the number of errors can never increase beyond \\\\gamma n\\\\,.  Lemma 4  If we start with s < \\\\gamma(1-2\\\\varepsilon)n\\\\,, then we never reach s = \\\\gamma n\\\\, at any point in the algorithm.  Proof  When we flip a vertex v_i\\\\,, o(i)\\\\, and e(i)\\\\, are interchanged, and since we had o(i) > e(i)\\\\,, this means the number of unsatisfied vertices on the right decreases by at least one after each flip. Since s < \\\\gamma(1-2\\\\varepsilon)n\\\\,, the initial number of unsatisfied vertices is at most d\\\\gamma(1-2\\\\varepsilon)n\\\\,, by the graph's d\\\\,-regularity. If we reached a string with \\\\gamma n\\\\, errors, then by Lemma 1, there would be at least d\\\\gamma(1-2\\\\varepsilon)n\\\\, unique neighbors, which means there would be at least d\\\\gamma(1-2\\\\varepsilon)n\\\\, unsatisfied vertices, a contradiction. Lemmas 3 and 4 show us that if we start with s < \\\\gamma(1-2\\\\varepsilon)n\\\\, (half the distance of C\\\\,), then we will always find a vertex v_i\\\\, to flip. Each flip reduces the number of unsatisfied vertices in R\\\\, by at least 1, and hence the algorithm terminates in at most m\\\\, steps, and it terminates at some codeword, by Lemma 3. (Were it not at a codeword, there would be some vertex to flip). Lemma 4 shows us that we can never be farther than \\\\gamma n\\\\, away from the correct codeword. Since the code has distance 2(1-\\\\varepsilon)\\\\gamma n > \\\\gamma n\\\\, (since \\\\varepsilon < \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\,), the codeword it terminates on must be the correct codeword, since the number of bit flips is less than half the distance (so we couldn't have traveled far enough to reach any other codeword). = Complexity = We now show that the algorithm can achieve linear time decoding. Let \\\\tfrac{n}{m}\\\\, be constant, and r\\\\, be the maximum degree of any vertex in R\\\\,. Note that r\\\\, is also constant for known constructions. # Pre-processing: It takes O(mr)\\\\, time to compute whether each vertex in R\\\\, has an odd or even number of neighbors. # Pre-processing 2: We take O(dn) = O(dmr)\\\\, time to compute a list of vertices v_i\\\\, in L\\\\, which have o(i) > e(i)\\\\,. # Each Iteration: We simply remove the first list element. To update the list of odd / even vertices in R\\\\,, we need only update O(d)\\\\, entries, inserting / removing as necessary. We then update O(dr)\\\\, entries in the list of vertices in L\\\\, with more odd than even neighbors, inserting / removing as necessary. Thus each iteration takes O(dr)\\\\, time. # As argued above, the total number of iterations is at most m\\\\,. This gives a total runtime of O(mdr) = O(n)\\\\, time, where d\\\\, and r\\\\, are constants.

Life Wasielewski was born in 1875 in Bonn. His father, Wilhelm Joseph von Wasielewski (1822‚Äì1896), was a prominent violinist, conductor and music editor. He studied natural science, history of literature, History of art, and philosophy at the universities of Bonn and Berlin, earning a doctorate in Botany in 1899. He habilitated at the University of Rostock as a private lecturer from 1899-1905. As a freelance writer, his efforts fell on music historical themes, Goethe, and especially the occult. The publisher Piper issued a volume of his poetry in 1909. His first encounters with the field of occultism may be dated to 1912, primarily to the symptoms of telepathy reported in Sir Oliver Lodge's book The Survival of Man. In Wasielewski's first writing on the subject, Wass muss jedermann vom Occultismus wissen (1915) [What everyone should know about the occult], the author tried to reconcile scientific methods to occult phenomena. In 1916 Wasielewski married Maria von Bloedau (1883‚Äì1963), whose mediumship led him to deepen his telepathic studies. In his main work on the subject, Telepathie und Hellsehen [Telepathy and clairvoyance] he attempted to prove the phenomena through scientific methods and testing, aided by his wife's telepathic abilities. Involved in these experiments was the doctor and parapsychologist Rudolf Tischner (1879‚Äì1961). A correspondence developed between Wasielewski and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke from Rilke's reaction to Telepathie und Hellsehen, which the famous poet read shortly after completing the Duino Elegies. Wasielewski died on 28 February 1959 in Sondershausen.

One of their first line-ups featured drummer Lionel Hicks, bassist Chris Dale, vocalist Tony Ritchie, and guitarists Bill Yates and Paul Curtis. In October 1996, this line-up started working on their first album titled When the World Falls Down.Balance of Power on MusicMight The album, produced by Hicks and Curtis, was picked up by Pony Canyon Records and released in Japan in 1997 where it was well received.Balance of Power Discography on RockBox The album was also released by Point Records around Europe.Balance of Power Discography on Balance-of-power.com After their first album, lead singer Tony Ritchie was replaced by American Lance King.

Ritchie, however, remained with the band as their main songwriter.Balance of Power Biography on United Kingdom Metal In 1998, the band released their second studio album, Book of Secrets. The album also featured new guitarist Pete Southern, who was a childhood friend of Hicks and Ritchie. After their second album, the band returned to the studio to work on the follow-up: Ten More Tales of Grand Illusion. At this time, founder and keyboardist Ivan Gunn left the band to concentrate on work with his record company, Anthem. When Chris Dale left the band, former vocalist and bassist Tony Ritchie rejoined them as bassist.Balance of Power - Tony Ritchie on Balance-of-power They then released their fourth album, Perfect Balance, in 2001.

Counter-Espionage was the ninth film in Columbia's Lone Wolf series, based on characters created by Louis Joseph Vance. It is also known as The Lone Wolf in Scotland Yard. Plot In the midst of World War II, Harvey Leeds, working as secretary for the highly reputed British criminologist Sir Stafford Hart in London, is lobbying for legislation ordering the immediate arrest of all foreign agents stationed in Britain. Harvey is engaged to Sir Stafford's daughter, Pamela, and is visiting the Hart mansion. He is about to leave the mansion to be with Pamela, who works at an air raid shelter, when he happens upon a briefcase in the foyer. He looks through the briefcase that belongs to Sir Stafford's assistant, Kent Wells, before heading out in the night. He doesn't get far though, and is knocked out by air raid warden Anton Schugg and thrown into the back of the warden's ambulance. Kent Wells happened to see Harvey go through his briefcase, and when he goes upstairs to the mansion's top floor, he sees someone opening Sir Stafford's safe in the library. Before Wells has any chance of stopping him, the man is off with the plan for the government's new secret weapon - the beam detector. The man drops a cufflink with the letter ‚ÄùL‚Äù on it. Sir Stafford involves Scotland Yard in the investigation of the stolen plans. Two American Inspectors, Crane and Dickens, are visiting the Yard and are invited by the chief investigator on the case, Inspector J. Stephens of Scotland Yard. The three men go to the Hart mansion and conclude that the ‚ÄùL‚Äù must mean that notorious jewel thief Michael Lanyard is responsible for the theft. He is also known as the ‚ÄùLone Wolf‚Äù. An air raid hits London, and during the commotion that ensues, the Lone Wolf meets with his valet Jamison. The building closest to them begins to topple, and the Lone Wolf saves a man from being crushed by it. The man, air raid warden George Barrow, expresses his gratitude and grants Lone Wolf a favor. During the rest of the raid, the Lone Wolf and his valet hide out in the same air raid shelter as Pamela works in. The Lone Wolf tries to hide the plans he has stolen, but Inspector Stephens soon arrives and arrests him for espionage. Stephens doesn't find the plans though, and Jamison manages to get them back after the Lone Wolf is taken away. During interrogation of the Lone Wolf, he manages to grab a gun and take Sir Stafford hostage. He escapes from custody, and happens to meets air raid warden Schugg outside, who gives him a ride, although not oblivious of his crime. Schugg then stops the car and offers the Lone Wolf a deal. He wants to buy the plans on behalf of the German agents in London. In charge of the Germans is the undercover agent Gustave Sossel. When the Lone Wolf is taken to the German agents‚Äô hideout, he also discovers that the Germans hold Harvey prisoner. The Lone Wolf explains that he doesn't have the plans, but he can retrieve them in a few days. Kent appears at the hideout and explains that he captured Harvey because he was too nosy. He also explains that the Germans intend to reveal the plans to Berlin through a radio broadcast from a radio transmitter at the hideout. The Lone Wolf is then let out in the street with instructions to inform Schugg when he has the plans. The newspapers report that Sir Stafford has died in the air raid. When Inspector Stephens visits the Hart mansion, he discovers a secret document sanctioning the Lone Wolf to work undercover for British Intelligence to disclose and catch a ring of spies in the country. Later, the Lone Wolf also makes contact with the Hart mansion, thus leading the police away from the mansion and to his own apartment. The Lone Wolf then go off in search for the German hideout, but discovers that Pamela is following them. Lanyard tricks her into phoning Stephens so that there will be police reinforcements in the district surrounding the spies's headquarters. Pamela alerts the police of their whereabouts, and they come to surround the German hideout, believing they are close to catching the thief. The Lone Wolf escapes the ring of police by riding in Barrow's ambulance. The Lone Wolf then returns to where he believes the hideout is, under the Blue Parrot Caf√©, and finds Pamela there. They are both apprehended by the German agents and taken to Sossel. It turns out Kent's real name is Kurt Weil, and that he's an agent for the Germans. The three police inspectors, who have tracked the Lone Wolf, are also apprehended by the Germans. When the Germans start broadcasting the plans, Barrow arrives and pretends to hold a stick of dynamite in his hand. The German agents throw down their guns, and the Lone Wolf explains to the Germans that the plans were fake, in order to find the ring of German spies. The Lone Wolf then produces the real plans to the police and is freed of all suspicion.

His debut novel, Dear American Airlines, was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2008. The novel, written in the form of a complaint letter to the titular airline, was reviewed by Richard Russo in The New York Times Book Review. His second novel, Want Not, was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2013. Early life Jonathan Miles was born in Cleveland, Ohio; his family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, but Miles ran away when he was 17, moving to Oxford, Mississippi, eventually attending the University of Mississippi and taking a writing class with Barry Hannah. Finding work as a newspaper reporter and aspiring jazz musician, Miles met novelist Larry Brown. The two became friends, and while Miles didn't graduate \\"Ole Miss\\", Brown taught and encouraged Miles to write: \\"It was an astonishing education. Some people go to the Iowa Writer's Workshop. I had Larry.\\" Literary career While Miles never studied journalism in college, his work soon found publication in a local literary magazine, the Oxford American, and he continued to contribute essays and critique for several years. A friend suggested Miles apply as a reporter for The Oxford Eagle, and while the pay wasn't good, being forced to churn out daily copy gradually improved his ability to write more dispassionately about complex and emotional subjects. Miles claims he was fired by the paper years later for writing an obituary about a subject who had admitted regularly providing bootlegged liquor to noted Oxford resident William Faulkner and correctly reporting the fact. Fortunately, Miles's writing caught the eye of Esquire editor Will Blythe, who published an account Miles wrote of an ingenious prison escape he'd investigated while writing for the Oxford paper. Miles soon developed a reputation as a keen observer of Mississippi culture, selling essays to Food & Wine, Men's Journal and The New York Times Magazine. He credits his early literary voice to his time in Oxford, Mississippi, but when Men's Journal offered him an annual contract Miles was already driving a moving van toward New York City in search of such an opportunity.

At the age of seven, he was among 27 Cree children taken from their homes to attend French-language schooling in La Tuque, while living with an English-speaking Anglican family. The program was cancelled the following year, but he remained there for ten years, completing his schooling in French. After that, he attended a meeting on the negotiations between the Cree and Government officials on constitutional and resource rights, which sparked his interest in pursuing a law degree.

It is part of the Bergen County Park system independently managed by the member-supported, non-profit organization, the Teaneck Creek Conservancy. The park contains of groomed trails and exhibits both permanent and ephemeral eco-art throughout the year. The conservancy operates art and environmental programs for the local community. The namesake of the conservancy is Teaneck Creek, which flows through the park and into Overpeck Creek. History The Teaneck Conservancy was founded in 2001 by local environmentalists, artists and educators to save a parcel of land from development. Through cooperation of community leaders and the Bergen County Parks Department, Teaneck Creek Park was opened to the public in 2006 containing 1.3 miles of groomed trails, an outdoor classroom, and ecological art exhibits. Since then the conservancy has continued to grow in community membership, sponsors, educational programs for the public and is known as a premier ecological art park in the region.  History trails  This Living Lesson is an online video series with correlating map points throughout the Teaneck Creek Conservancy. The 22-minute tour has both visual and audio features. It is accessible online or by QR code located at TCC. The tour spans centuries of history at the creek and touches on plans for the future. The project was made possible in part though grant funds administered by the Bergen County Division of Cultural and Historic Affairs, Department of Parks, through a General Operating Support Grant from the New Jersey Historical Commission, a division of the Department of State. Ecological art The conservancy commissions and hosts ephemeral and permanent eco-art exhibitions throughout the year. Five Pipes Project Of the tons of concrete debris dumped on the park site during the construction of Interstate 95 and I-80, five monolithic concrete drainage pipes marred the natural landscape. They were too large and heavy to remove without considerable destruction to the park and remained as a graffiti covered reminder of the history of environmental degradation. In 2008, the Teaneck Creek Conservancy commissioned Brooklyn muralist Eduardo Aleander Rabel to lead a group of volunteers including students from the Thomas Jefferson Middle School and AIE NJ State Council on the Arts Grant artist John Kaiser to create murals inside and without all five pipes. The murals of each pipe represent a different era in American history beginning with the Native Americans and ending with the 21st century. The Five Pipes was completed and opened to the public in October 2009 in a ribbon cutting ceremony. Turtle Peace Labyrinth In 2003, Ariane Burgess of Camino de Paz was commissioned to create an oasis of peace and contemplation in the undisturbed heart of the conservancy. Together with Artist-in-Residence Rick Mills, hundreds of volunteers, families, and community groups turned a site filled with vines and construction debris into the Turtle Peace Labyrinth. Completion of the project ended in 2004. The labyrinth was constructed from New Jersey construction debris found on-site at the Teaneck Creek Conservancy. The concrete debris were relocated and laid out in a labyrinth design reminiscent of a turtle's back in an homage to the Lenape creation myth. In 2017, a new fence made by NJ artist David Robinson was built surrounding the labyrinth.  The Harmony Garden  The Harmony Garden was created by Erika and Elizabeth Herman, Teaneck residents and students of the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut. This project was made possible by a Norton Fellowship Grant from Loomis Chaffee. This project used recycled and natural materials to make musical instruments, combining a love of music and a passion for sustainable living. Visitors can scan other QR codes to learn about each instrument, how it was made, what materials were used and how to make the best sound.  Sustainability = The Jack Flamholz Water Sustainability Project  This rainwater harvesting system from Israel, believed to be the first use on the East Coast, was designed by Amir Yachelli. Six rain barrels are located at Teaneck's Hawthorne Elementary School, and two are located at Teaneck Creek Conservancy. In 2018, the conservancy commissioned artist Scott Furman to create water-themed murals installed on the TCC barrels.  The New Jersey Sustainable Business Registry  In 2018, the Teaneck Creek Conservancy became the first and only Teaneck business registered with the NJSBDC.

Later, after Kern City was annexed by Bakersfield, the streetcar company operated completely in Bakersfield. The company was originally formed in 1887, under the name Bakersfield and Sumner Railroad. At its height, in 1915, the company operated five streetcar lines, totaling . It also operated three feeder bus lines, one of the first companies in the nation to offer that type of service. Also, with the exception of one-way sections, the entire system was double tracked. The company discontinued streetcar service in 1942, having replaced them with buses. The current provider of mass transit for Bakersfield, Golden Empire Transit, is the latest of an unbroken line of owners of the company. History=Early history In 1874, after a land dispute between the City of Bakersfield and the Southern Pacific Railroad, the railroad built its tracks about east of the city. It founded the town of Sumner as its rail stop. It was soon realized that efficient transportation between these two points was needed. So in the same year, a franchise was granted by the city for the construction of a streetcar line. That company, however, never constructed the line. Transportation was instead provided by road vehicles. One of the earliest was the H. H. Fish Omnibus Line, which charged $1 for the trip. In 1887, a second franchise was granted to a partnership made up of T.J. Packard, H.A. Blodget, John Keith and H.H. Fish (the operator of the Omnibus Line). In 1888, they constructed a single track railroad between the Courthouse in Bakersfield with the Southern Pacific Train Station. The company was named the Bakersfield and Sumner Railroad. The company used horse drawn cars. The track used 16-pound rails, which were previously used in a mine. The underlying ballast was substandard, and during heavy rain, the cars would sink into the street, or derail. The trek was through rural terrain, with little development. Electrification In December 1894, the Power Development Company was founded. Its owners were H. A. Blodgett, C. N. Beale, S. W. Fergusson, W. S. Tevis and Henry Jastro. The company began work on constructing a hydroelectric power plant at the base of the Kern River Canyon. The construction was completed in 1897. It also would provide enough power for an electric streetcar line. In 1900, the power company absorbed the streetcar line. That same year, the subsidiary was named the Bakersfield and Kern Electric Railway (Sumner was incorporated in 1892 and was renamed Kern City). With electricity being provided in a large enough quantity, the company began electrifying the line. An unusual decision was made to use a 550-volt system, instead of the more common 600-volt. In preparation for heavier cars, the rails were upgraded to 36-pound girder type (which was previously used in Australia). Four 24-seat passenger cars were purchased. Inaugural service of the new upgraded line was on February 17, 1901. The trip would take only 12 minutes. One year later, the company began making plans for an ambitious expansion. Four single track lines would be constructed within Bakersfield. They were operational in 1903. Although some of these routes would be realigned or extended, this made up the basic streetcar system used in the city for the next 20 years. In 1903, \\"observation car\\" service started. The route started at the intersection of 19th Street and Chester Avenue and traversed the entire system. Its primary purpose was for sightseeing. It was decorated with flags and cost $0.10 to ride. Originally it only operated on Sundays. However, it was so popular that two evening weekday services was also added. Major expansion and upgrade In 1909, the first section of track was double tracked. It was the main line on 19th Street, between F Street and H Street. The track was also upgraded with 87-pound rails. The next year, the company was purchased by the San Joaquin Light and Power Company. This would result in a major overhaul of the entire system. Between 1911 and 1912, with the exception of one-way sections, the entire system was double tracked. Also, all of the track was upgraded to 87-pound rails, in preparation for new cars which were purchased. The car barn was also be moved from 19th Street and Union Avenue, to 19th Street and Oak Street, adjacent to the Recreation Park. The previous yard was used for storage by the power company. In 1915 the first \\"bus\\" system was started in the city. Called \\"jitney,\\" they were little more than a model-T Ford station wagon. It would connect the city with the outlying areas. They would greatly impact the profits of the streetcar line. That same year, ordinances were passed by the city, which restricted where they could operate, so they would not be a direct competitor to the streetcar company. The Bakersfield and Kern Electric Railway also started running its own feeder bus service, to connect the outlying areas with the streetcar line. Decline In 1920, a fire started in the Recreation Park adjacent to the car barn. The fire spread and destroyed the car barn. Two streetcars were lost in the fire. It was decided to abandon the Oak Street location and move operations back to the Union Avenue facilities. By the mid-1920s, bus transportation began to dominate the public transportation market. Ridership on the streetcar would continue to decline. In 1933, after continued losses, the San Joaquin Power and Light Company would sell the streetcar and bus company to the employees. Starting that year, bus lines would begin to replace streetcar lines. By the end, the only streetcar route that would operate was the original Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Line. In 1942, streetcar service would end and the system was completely run by buses. City ownership and bus operations The company continued to operate privately for several years. It also continued to use the name Bakersfield and Kern Electric Railway, even though none of the system was operated by rail. In 1949, the name was changed to the Bakersfield Transit Company. There was a continued rise in automobile use, which resulted in a decrease in ridership for the company. By 1956, the city would temporary run the system. The following year, after approval by the voters, the city purchased the bus system for $395,000. It was named the Bakersfield Transit Agency. Under the city's ownership, there were little changes made to the system. Some new equipment was purchased in the late 1950s and in 1960. Also, there were some minor route changes to serve new growth areas of the city. By 1970, the system was losing $91,000 per year. Also, much of the system was being operated in the county. The city asked the voters whether they wanted to continue having a bus system. Over 70% voted in favor of keeping it. Two years later, after a second vote, the Golden Empire Transit District was formed. It would take over ownership and operation of the bus line. It would also end the city's direct involvement in its operation. Routes=Streetcar routes At its height, five streetcar routes were operated. *Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Line - This was the main line which ran from the Santa Fe Bakersfield Station to the Southern Pacific Sumner Station (later Bakersfield Station). *F Street and H Street Loop - This started at the terminal of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Line. It traveled south on F Street to California Avenue. It then looped north on H Street, ending at a switch on 19th Street, reconnecting with the main line. This created a loop. Later the H Street switch was abandoned and the loop became a line between Santa Fe Station and the intersection of 19th Street and H Street (although it continued to have the name loop). *North Chester Line - It initially ran from the intersection of 19th Street and Chester Avenue, to the intersection of 30th Street and K Street. It was later realigned to run entirely on Chester Avenue, ending at 32nd Street, across the tracks from the Southern Pacific Chester Station. *South Chester Line - This ran from the intersection of 19th Street and Chester Avenue to the intersection of 8th Street and Chester Avenue. It then looped back via 8th Street, N Street and 11th Street. *West 19th Street Line - This started at the intersection of 19th Street and F Street, where the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Line turned south to connect to the Santa Fe Bakersfield Station. It continued west to Oak Street, where it turned south to Truxtun Avenue. A short branch line was constructed on Ceder Street, which terminated at 18th Street. Feeder bus routes Before the conversion of streetcar service to buses, three bus routes were in operation. The Westpark Line started at the Santa Fe Bakersfield Station and served the area southeast of the station (which is known as Westpark). Another line started at the Southern Pacific Bakersfield Station, and traveled east on Niles Street to Brown Street. The last line also started at the Southern Pacific Bakersfield Station and traveled north on Baker Street to Garces Street, where the waterworks was located. Equipment A total of 23 electric streetcars were purchased over the life of the system. The early cars were open‚Äìclosed California cars. Later entirely enclosed cars were purchased. After that, light-weight safety cars replaced the heavier equipment. These cars could start and stop quickly and could not move when the door was opened. Little information is known about the horse drawn cars that operated before the line was electrified. From pictures, it is known that they were open air and could seat 18 to 20 people. Little is also known about the number and type of buses the company operated.

The school offers on-campus and online training on real estate investing, and provides a permanent structure and support system for those people who wish to continue using the organization's facilities, advisors, and resources after they have completed their training. Founded in 1980Maryland Department of Assessments & Taxation, Date of formation July 11, 1980, Investors United, LTD. by real estate entrepreneur and auctioneer Charles Parrish, Investors United has expanded its operations from a single classroom with a local focus, to an institution with services offered nationally. The school's literature states that it is ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs oldest school dedicated to teaching the techniques of proper real estate investing.‚Äù This assertion has been upheld by other organizations in the industry and by publications researching the school.http://www.invest-magazine.com/ Sept/Oct 2010 edition In addition to its corporate name, Investors United also holds several registered trademarks including its motto: \\"You will succeed - Guaranteed\\", and slogan \\"Earn while you learn.\\" History In the early 1970s, Charles Parrish had established himself as a real estate investor in Maryland. By forming partnerships with other real estate practitioners, he created several small, informal real estate investment groups that were connected to each other primarily through him. Noticing a lack of permanent networking outlet for people interested in real estate investment, Charles Parrish established the Maryland Real Estate Investors Association (MDREIA). During meetings of the MDREIA, veteran real estate developers found themselves regularly answering questions from new investors and home buyers interested in getting the best value from the purchase or sale of their real estate. Parrish recognized the public interest in the knowledge that he and his colleagues had accumulated, so he began organizing classes that he believed would apply broadly to real estate buyers and sellers, whether they were single family homeowners or high-rise developers. In 1980, Investors United began as a single-classroom consulting program and investment group led by Charles Parrish. Invited personally by Parrish, the inaugural members were all working real estate investors who were interested in learning new techniques and teaching them to others to enhance the overall capabilities of the group. Since that time, the school has expanded and updated its courses to cover trends and methods that have evolved since its founding. In 1998, Ian Parrish became President of Investors United School of Real Estate Investing and began an initiative to increase the school's reach and capabilities. In 2001,the school acquired the former headquarters of the Madison & Bradford Bank in Baltimore, MD; and all of Investors United's classrooms and administrative offices were moved to the 31,000 square foot facility. To accommodate the school's expansion, all classrooms and conference rooms were upgraded to accommodate online interactivity. The move also allowed for the addition of meeting suites, a multi-media computer lab, and a real estate library.The Baltimore Business Journal March 26, 2004 Instructional program Investors United's instructional program is based on the Montessori method and philosophy of education, which values self-paced learning and real-world engagement. The school offers online courses to prepare students with a foundation of real estate knowledge which is further developed by for-profit real estate investing activities under the guidance of its instructors. On its website, the school describes this learning method by its motto: \\"Earn while you learn.\\" Education on real estate investment has traditionally been fractured into courses on single topics (e.g. lease options, flipping etc.). By contrast, Investors United' curriculum of 12 courses represent what its president, Ian Parrish, calls \\"the full anatomy of real estate investing\\". Because the various areas of real estate investment are interrelated, the school encourages students to become familiar with each of them. All of the school's courses and instructional materials are available online, so that each student can learn at their own pace. http://www.investorsunited.com/sf1.php Course Curriculum Ongoing personal support is provided to students weekly in three-hour workshops held in the school's main classroom and broadcast interactively to online students. Workshops are hosted by instructors and attended by students of diverse business experience, financial status, and social backgrounds, making for a heterogeneous learning environment which is intended by the school to give students the opportunity to learn from the experiences of other members, and also to stimulate networking, partnerships, and financial achievement in the business of real estate investment Whereas traditional realty training courses focus on licensure as their curricular goal, the stated goal of the Investors United program is for its students to earn money investing in real estate during their training.After completion of the 12-month training program, graduates become full-fledged Investors United members, which entitles them to continued access to on-campus and online resources including real estate investment courses and workshops, real estate reference material, contracts and form templates, and access to the school's network of members and instructors. Members also provided with a subscription to IURealist, the school's proprietary online real estate database and software program. The software is provided to members by the school at no charge and available to non-members as a paid subscription service. Enrollment and Membership The people who make up Investors United's membership body are socio-economically diverse, and include business owners, military and law enforcement, PhDs, everyday wage earners, and even public figures. Notwithstanding, Investors United maintains a comparatively low new student enrollment rate. Since its inception, the school has averaged fewer than 200 new students per year. However, after the initial year-long training, membership longevity in Investors United is quite high; the number of members in the institution currently outstrips the student population (or \\"members in training\\" as the school calls them) by a ratio of over 5 to 1. Environmental initiatives In 2001, in response to Ian Parrish's interest in environmentally efficient building methods, Investors United began adding Green Building techniques into its curriculum. Several studies have shown that structures renovated using sustainable design methods decrease their environmental impact on the surrounding community and increase both their resale and rental values. Parrish stated in a 2008 message to his members that ‚ÄúAdopting these techniques now won‚Äôt just help us avoid problems later. They‚Äôll save on materials, on water, on fuel, and on money. As investors, we call that a win- win.‚ÄùLoyola College of Maryland, Sellinger School of Business, Lecture series of September 15, 2010 Distance learning Distance learning is offered by the school using Sonic Foundry's Mediasite systemhttp://www.sonicfoundry.com/mediasite/ that allows for interactive real- time communication with online instructors. The school archives classes on its server for up to 3 years, allowing Student Members to review classes and view previous versions of current and upcoming courses. The Mediasite software is activated through a portal using the Moodle open-source Learning Management System (LMS). Support systems In 2010, Investors United entered into an agreement with CoreLogic, the custodian of First American Corporation's U.S. database of properties, to license a software system that would allow members to gather property, neighborhood, and owner information. First American, through Corelogic, collects and distributes property ownership, geographic, and demographic information used by investors, capital markets, and government agencies. The resulting Web site, IURealist.com,http://www.iurealist.com/ IURealist was then made available to IU members at no charge, and to non- members as a paid subscription service. The organization maintains a database of forms and reference materials on its servers for use by its members. In 2009, the school's directors began reviewing and summarizing proposed state and federal property legislation. Each year, Investors United sends those summaries directly to its members, and makes them available to any interested party via the school's Web site. In early 2011, the school's directors chose to convert student texts and instructional materials to an exclusively electronic format.

A survey completed in 2017 indicated that game development in Australia employed 928 people. In fiscal year 2016-17, revenue from Australian game developers was approximately $118.5 million, 80 percent of which was from overseas sales. Video game retailers in Australia include EB Games, JB Hi-Fi, Gametraders and The Gamesmen. Video games are also sold at department stores like Big W and Target Australia.  History  The Gamesmen, an Australian video game retailer, was established in 1982. They were the first retailer to sell video games online in Australia when they launched their website on 18 July 1996. Beam Software was one of the first Australian game development studios to achieve global success, with a text adventure adaption of The Hobbit released in 1982 for the ZX Spectrum. The company went on to produce other successful titles including The Way of the Exploding Fist for Commodore 64 in 1985 and Le Mans for the SEGA Dreamcast in 2001. Ozisoft, a major distributor of games, was established in 1982. Other early game development studios in Australia include SSG, who developed Reach for the Stars in 1983, and Micro Fort√©, founded by John De Margheriti in 1985. John De Margheriti later established the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE) in 1996 and founded the Game Developers Association of Australia (GDAA) in 1999. The first president of the GDAA was Adam Lancman, who had previously worked at Beam Software. The Game Wizards, an Australian video game retailer, was established in 1990. It was the second retailer to sell games online in Australia when it set up its website in 1997. In 2007, the company's 22 stores were acquired by GAME and re-branded. By 2009 GAME Australia had expanded to over 100 stores. EB Games entered the market as a video game retailer in 1997. The real-time strategy game Dark Reign: The Future of War, developed by Queensland-based Auran, achieved widespread critical and commercial success upon its release in 1997.Dark Reign: The Future of War ‚Äì Review by Vince Broady, GameSpot, 2 October 1997\\"Timeline of Game Development in Australia\\" by the game Developers Association of Australia (GDAA), published by the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (acmi) A research report published by the association in 2005 found that the 76 per cent of households had a device for playing video games, 38 per cent of gamers were female and the average age of a gamer was 24. In 2005, the top three games by units sold were Gran Turismo 4, GTA: San Andreas and Pok√©mon Emerald. The most popular game genres were strategy, adventure and action. Team Bondi, a Sydney-based independent third-party game developer, was founded in 2003. The studio was responsible for the Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 title L.A. Noire, published by multinational video game developer and publisher Rockstar Games (also popular for the Grand Theft Auto series). L.A. Noire was both a critical and commercial success, with over 5 million sales. Despite this, Team Bondi was in massive debt before and after the launch of L.A. Noire and the company wound up on 5 October 2011. Between 2005 and 2015, a number of other large studios operating in Australia shut down including KMM Brisbane, Pandemic Studios, Krome Studios, THQ, Visceral Games and 2K Australia. During the same period, smaller game developers were having success with mobile games. In 2010, Halfbrick, a studio based in Brisbane, released Fruit Ninja which has since been downloaded over a billion times. Other notable mobile games developed in Australia include Crossy Road and Framed. In October 2015, half of the top 10 mobile games in the App Store were Australian made. EB Games held the first EB Expo video game convention at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre in 2011. The expo was attended by over 10,000 people. The expo moved to the Sydney Showground for 2012 and was held there annually until the expo returned to the Gold Coast in 2017. 36,750 people attended the expo in 2015. At PAX Prime 2012, it was announced that PAX would expand internationally to Australia. PAX Australia was held for the first time in 2013 at the Melbourne Showgrounds. The annual event remains the only PAX event held out side of the United States. On 14 May 2012 GAME, which had since downsized to 26 stores, went into administration and subsequently closed down. The Digital Australia 2012 report, published by the IGEA, found that female participation in video gaming had risen to 48 per cent and the average age of an Australian video gamer had hit 32. Traditional retail sales of video games in Australia during 2012 were $1.16 Billion; digital sales were estimated at $620 Million. In 2013, Australia was ranked 14th in the world in terms of video game revenues. On 22 June 2015 the Australian Senate commenced an inquiry into the future of Australia's video game development industry. The subsequent report was tabled on 29 April 2016.  Trade bodies  The industry body for video games in Australia is the Interactive Games & Entertainment Association (IGEA). IGEA was formed in 2002 initially as the Interactive Entertainment Association of Australia (IEAA) as an industry association for publishers, distributors and marketers of video games. The IEAA was renamed to IGEA in 2009 to present more focus on video game entertainment. The Game Developers Association of Australia (GDAA) supports video game development. Among its activities is organizing the annual Game Connect Asia Pacific (GCAP) conference. On March 6, 2020, the GDAA members votes to allow IGEA to acquire all the assets of GDAA under the IGEA banner, which will include operations of GCAP.  Censorship  Video games could not be designated an adults only or 18+ rating in Australia until 1 January 2013. An R18+ classification rating has been available for this purpose for other forms of media since the introduction of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. Prior to 1 January 2013, a video game that had content deemed unsuitable for persons under the age of 18 would be 'Refused Classification' by the Australian Classification Board (ACB) under this act. Classification of video games is mandatory in Australia and material refused classification is legally banned from sale, hire or import. Notable video games that were refused classification by the ACB prior to the introduction of an R18+ for video games include: Duke Nukem 3D, Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto IV, Fallout 3, Left 4 Dead 2, Mortal Kombat (2011) and The House of the Dead: Overkill Extended Cut. Most of these games were subsequently modified by the publishers and later reclassified MA15+ and made available for sale in Australia. Although some games (GTA 3 and Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition) would be later rated R18+ uncut and The House of the Dead : Overkill was given an uncut MA15+ on appeal. On 22 July 2011, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General agreed in-principle to introduce legislation that would allow video games to be classified R18+. Amendments to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 came into effect on 1 January 2013 to allow video games to receive the adults only rating. Games that were refused classification prior to 1 January 2013 can be designated an R18+ rating and made available for sale in Australia if the publisher of the game applies for re-classification and pays a fee. Games can still be refused classification and banned from sale if they depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified. Notable video games that have been refused classification since the introduction of an R18+ for video games include: Saints Row IV, South Park: The Stick of Truth, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number and Outlast 2. Material which is refused classification is put on the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service list of prohibited items. Any copies of these games found at the border will be seized, and its recipient, depending on the number of copies being imported may receive up to AUD$110,000 in fines. An individual is allowed to own, use, access or create Refused Classification items, including games (with the exception of Western Australia). But a Refused Classification rating means that the created item is illegal to sell within Australia.

Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\" is the 24th episode of the seventh season of the American comedy television series The Office and the show's 150th episode overall. The episode was written by Justin Spitzer and directed by Troy Miller. It originally aired in the United States on May 12, 2011 on NBC. The episode also features guest appearances from Kathy Bates, Cody Horn and Michael Schur. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) becomes the interim regional manager, instituting a typically heavy-handed management style. Meanwhile, Gabe (Zach Woods) tries to win back Erin (Ellie Kemper), but Andy (Ed Helms) gets in his way. The episode received positive reviews from critics, with many commenting that it proved the series could survive without the lead actor, Steve Carell, and others calling it the best episode of the series in years. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\" drew an estimated 6.45 million viewers and earned a 3.3 rating/8% share among those aged 18‚Äì49, making it the second-lowest-rated episode of the season after \\"Todd Packer\\". Synopsis When Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) ends up in a coma on life support, Jo Bennett (Kathy Bates) makes Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) the interim regional manager before they find a proper replacement, much to Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) chagrin, as the office had actually functioned very smoothly during the manager hiatus. As Jim notes, everyone showed up, worked for the day with reasonable breaks, and were highly productive. Once appointed, Dwight establishes a strict management style in stark contrast to their previously relaxed style, from making the employees recite the Pledge of Allegiance in the morning, setting up firewalls, creating long passwords to use the office's various machines, and installing antique punch clocks. He also renovates his office with odd decorations, such as a marble desk and a piranha tank. Jim, who had turned down the temporary manager position believing that they should not be assigned one at all, is especially unhappy with the changes, and begins pranking Dwight by suggesting that he is leading an uprising called \\"The Fist.\\" To impress Jo, Dwight buys a gun (the same kind Jo collects), though he is more excited when he receives a holster as a gift from a relative, and uses the gun to accessorize. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) insists that he put it away, but Dwight accidentally fires the gun right by Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), causing him temporary hearing loss. Dwight attempts to bribe the office workers into silence with various favors, and Jim insists that Dwight do outlandish things (such as doing jazz hands and saying \\"Shagedelic, baby\\") at certain promptings. Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) continues with his attempts to win back Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper). He invites Andy to go to the conference room to speak in private. Gabe tearfully breaks down, and Andy promises he will not date Erin again. Gabe confronts Andy with the promise after he sees the two hanging out together, but Andy stands up for himself and embarrasses Gabe by describing Gabe's crying fit to Erin. When asked whether he wants to date Erin, he refuses to give a straight answer. When Jo comes to visit the branch, Dwight admits to the gun incident. He attempts to divert the blame to his employees, saying that blackmail is a bigger crime than firing a gun accidentally, but Jo takes the position away from him, telling him that shooting is worse. Jo later instates Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton), who has the most seniority in the office, as acting manager until a committee composed of Jim, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), and Gabe find a replacement. While Jim tells Dwight that Jo did the right thing, he also compliments Dwight, noting that the office got every single company order out on time. Production Kathy Bates reprised her role as Sabre CEO Jo Bennett. \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\" was the ninth episode of the series written by supervising producer Justin Spitzer, and the first directed by Troy Miller. The original working title for this episode was \\"Interim Manager\\" but was considered too bland by Office writer Mindy Kaling. While writing the episode, Spitzer originally titled it \\"Dwight K. Schrute\\", but decided the title was not descriptive enough, so he renamed it \\"Dwight K. Schrute, Interim Manager\\", before realizing that Acting Manager fits Dwight's role better and changed it to \\"Dwight K. Schrute, Acting Manager\\". Spitzer then decided that Dwight would downplay the acting part of the position and renamed the episode to its current title \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\". The episode features the return of Kathy Bates as Jo Bennett. This is her first on-screen appearance since \\"Nepotism\\". The long absence is due to her starring in the other NBC series, Harry's Law. The episode also marks the second appearance of Cody Horn as Jordan Garfield, Deangelo's executive assistant, and the first of three new roles since Carell's departure. The role was originally said to be recurring at first with a chance of her becoming a series regular in the eighth season. She eventually did not return for the eighth season. The episode also features a voice guest appearance from former producer and writer for The Office Michael Schur as Mose Schrute, his first appearance on the show since \\"Counseling\\" due to his being the show runner for the other NBC sitcom, Parks and Recreation. The official website for The Office included four cut scenes from \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\" within a week of the episode's release. In the first, 66-second clip, Dwight shows the documentary crew his new office apparel including his desk modeled after Uday Hussein's desk. In the second, 77-second clip, Jim pranks Dwight by putting fake results from Jordan's surveillance of the office. Later in her talking head, it is hinted that Jordan has a crush on Jim. In the third, 86-second clip, the staff realize they are stuck with Dwight as their boss as Phyllis attempts to remember a movie. In the fourth, 49-second clip, Gabe attempts to get Erin back by using her love of Pixar films, but ultimately fails. Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast on May 13, 2011, \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\" was viewed by an estimated 6.45 million viewers and received a 3.3 rating/9% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.3% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 9% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a nine percent drop in the ratings from the previous episode making it the second-lowest-rated episode of the season in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, after \\"Todd Packer\\". \\"Dwight K Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\" was the sixth most-watched scripted show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18‚Äì49. Reviews \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\" received positive reviews from critics. IGN reviewer Cindy White commented: \\"This episode proved that the show can be funny without him (Steve Carell)\\". She also praised Rainn Wilson and John Krasinski's performance in the episode calling it \\"one of my favorite dynamics on the show\\". However, she criticized the Andy-Gabe-Erin love triangle storyline, commenting: \\"It's only been made worse by the way they've turned Gabe from meek, bumbling burocrat [sic] into unhinged stalker guy.\\" She ultimately gave the episode an 8.0/10. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode \\"fun\\" and a \\"drastic improvement from 'The Inner Circle. He mainly praised the return of \\"The Dwight/Jim dynamic\\", writing that he \\"briefly rethought the idea of Dwight as long-term boss\\", and went on to praise the writers for featuring Dwight as manager for only one episode. He ultimately concluded that \\"the first real impression of the show after Michael was a strong one.\\" TV Squad writer Joel Keller was very positive towards the episode commenting that \\"The story also gave me faith that Lieberstein and company might actually do a credible job of exploring the other folks in the office now that the show's dominant force, Michael, is gone\\". The A.V. Clubs Myles McNutt stated that Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager' demonstrated that the show is perfectly capable of being funny without Carell\\", but criticized the episode for not featuring more \\"subtle\\" humor. He ultimately gave the episode a B. Sam Morgan of Hollywood.com called the episode \\"fairly decent episode\\" commenting that the concept of the episode was similar to the 10th episode of the seventh season, \\"China\\". He also positively commented on Ellie Kemper's performance, writing that \\"She came into this series as a sketch actor but for the first time I think she finally started being an 'actor. Several commentators praised the scene featuring Dwight massaging Kevin's back. \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\" was voted the fourth highest-rated episode out of 24 from the seventh season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the episode was rated 8.81 out of 10. In another poll, the episode was voted the second-highest-rated out of 24 from the seventh season, according to an \\"Survivor\\" episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally.

Life Findlater was born 10 January 1754 in the manse of West Linton, Peeblesshire. His grandfather, Alexander Findlater, was from Moray, and married into the family of Kirkaldy of Grange. Thomas (1697‚Äì1778), his son, was minister of West Linton, but his settlement there in 1729 was opposed by certain of the parishioners, and led to the rise of a secessionist congregation. Charles Findlater was Thomas Findlater's son by his second wife, Jean, daughter of William Brown, an Edinburgh bookseller. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh on 14 November 1770. In 1777 he was ordained assistant to his father, and in 1790 was presented by William Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensberry to the neighbouring parish, Newlands. He lived there until 1835, and then retiring from duty, died at Glasgow 28 May 1838, aged 84. His appointment at Newlands, like his father's at West Linton, was opposed, and led to the establishment of a seceding congregation. On 26 July 1791 he married Janet Hay Russell, who was accidentally burnt to death in 1828. He was father of the synod of Lothian and Tweeddale, and was buried at Newlands. A marble bust of him, funded by subscription, was in the Peebles Art Gallery. Findlater was an unconventional liberal theologian. He established one of the first local savings banks, and used to carry its account-book when on his pastoral work. He would sing a song at a cottar's wedding, and on wintry Sundays gather his congregation round him in his kitchen and give them dinner afterwards. Works Findlater published: *Liberty and Equality; a Sermon or Essay, with an Appendix on Godwin's system of society in his \\"Political Justice,\\" 1800. This sermon, preached at Newlands, was directed against the \\"monstrous doctrine of equality\\". Some of William Godwin's sympathisers then attacked Findlater, and he hid himself until the Lord Advocate, Sir James Montgomery, was able to appease the outcry. The sermon was dedicated to Montgomery when printed. *General View of the Agriculture of the County of Peebles, Edinburgh, 1802. *Sermons or Essays, as the Reader shall chuse to design them, upon Christian Duties, 1830.

The states of California and New Mexico have committed most recently to emission reductions targets, joining New Jersey, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Washington and Oregon. Regional initiatives can be more efficient than programs at the state level, as they encompass a broader geographical area, eliminate duplication of work, and create more uniform regulatory environments. Over the past few years, a number of regional initiatives have begun developing systems to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, increase renewable energy generation, track renewable energy credits, and research and establish baselines for carbon sequestration. State initiatives=Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative In December 2005, the governors of seven Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states agreed to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap and trade system covering carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from regional power plants. Currently (at the time of this edit), Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont have signed, and Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich signed legislation in March 2006 that commits Maryland to join RGGI by 2007. To facilitate compliance with reduction targets, RGGI will provide flexibility mechanisms that include credits for emissions reductions achieved outside of the electricity sector. The successful implementation of the RGGI model will set the stage for other states to join or form their own regional cap and trade systems and may encourage the program to expand to other greenhouse gases and other sectors. RGGI states, along with Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, are also developing a GHG registry called the Eastern Climate Registry. On November 29, 2011, New Jersey withdrew from the initiative, effective January 1, 2012. \\"Program Design Archive\\". RGGI, Inc. Groups such as Acadia Center have since reported on lost revenue resulting from New Jersey's departure, and argued for renewed participation. \\"New Jersey and RGGI: Potential Benefits of Renewed Participation\\" (PDF). Acadia Center. March 2015. After the election of Ralph Northam in the 2017 Virginia gubernatorial election and Phil Murphy in the 2017 New Jersey gubernatorial election, New Jersey and Virginia began to make preliminary moves to join RGGI. \\"Virginia moving forward with cap-and-trade plan soon after Democratic win\\". \\"With Christie Out, New Jersey Poised To Rejoin New England In Climate Pact\\". The Western Governors' Association The Western Governors' Association (WGA) Clean and Diversified Energy Initiative, including 18 western states, has begun investigating strategies to increase efficiency and renewable energy sources in their electricity systems. Governors Richardson (NM), Schwarzenegger (CA), Freudenthal (WY) & Hoeven (ND) serve as lead Governors on this initiative. To meet its goals, the Initiative's advisory committee (CDEAC) appointed eight technical task forces to develop recommendations based on reviews of specific clean energy and efficiency options. The CDEAC made final recommendations to the Western Governors' Association on June 11, 2006. Additionally, the WGA and the California Energy Commission are creating the Western Renewable Energy Generation Information State (WREGIS). WREGIS is a voluntary system for renewable energy credits and tracks renewable energy credits (RECs) across 11 western states in order to facilitate trading to meet renewable energy portfolio standards. Other initiatives As of 2020, several states in the northeastern United States were discussing a regional cap and trade system for carbon emissions from motor vehicle fuel sources, called the Transportation Climate Initiative.Mass. Part Of Regional Effort To Drive Down Emissions From Gas And Diesel The governors of Arizona and New Mexico signed an agreement to create the Southwest Climate Change Initiative in February 2006. The two states collaborated to assess greenhouse gas emissions and address the impacts of climate change in the Southwest and on September 8, 2006, Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano issued an executive order to implement recommendations included in the Climate Change Advisory Group's Climate Action Plan.http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?/press-release/4111/ The West Coast states‚ÄîWashington, Oregon, and California‚Äîare cooperating on a strategy to reduce GHG emissions, known as the Western Coast Governors' Global Warming Initiative. Finally, on February 26, 2007, these five Western states (Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, and New Mexico) agreed to combine their efforts to develop regional targets for reducing greenhouse emissions, creating the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative. In 2001 six New England states committed to the New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers (NEG-ECP) Climate Change Action Plan 2001, including short and long- term GHG emission reduction goals. Powering the Plains, launched in 2002, is a regional effort involving participants from the Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and the Canadian Province of Manitoba. This initiative aims to develop strategies, policies, and demonstration projects for alternative energy sources and technology and climate-friendly agricultural development. Municipal initiatives=ICLEI In 1993, at the invitation of ICLEI, municipal leaders met at the United Nations in New York and adopted a declaration that called for the establishment of a worldwide movement of local governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and enhance urban sustainability. The result was the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) Campaign. Since its inception, the CCP Campaign has grown to involve more than 650 local governments worldwide that are integrating climate change mitigation into their decision-making processes. U.S. Mayors' Climate Protection Agreement On February 16, 2005, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels launched an initiative to advance the goals of the Kyoto Protocol through leadership and action by at least 141 American cities, and as of October, 2006, 319 mayors representing over 51.4 million Americans had accepted the challenge. Under the terms of the Mayors Climate Protection Center, cities must commit to three actions in striving to meet the Kyoto Protocol in their own communities. These actions include: * Strive to meet or beat the Kyoto Protocol targets in their own communities, through actions ranging from anti- sprawl land-use policies to urban forest restoration projects to public information campaigns; * Urge their state governments, and the federal government, to enact policies and programs to meet or beat the greenhouse gas emission reduction target suggested for the United States in the Kyoto Protocol‚Äî7% reduction from 1990 levels by 2012; and * Urge the U.S. Congress to pass the bipartisan greenhouse gas reduction legislation, which would establish a national emission trading system.

Unlike traditional cubic optical systems, Optoform employs a concentric bore pattern that allows interconnection between mounts using rods along their optical axis, or at right angles via corner connectors. The circular patterns allow for easier assembly of optical components in a more natural fashion with other optical components, such as lenses. These bores could also utilize linear bearings, and micrometers for precise linear, and X-Y positioning of optical elements. The word Optoform is derived from optical functionality+form. Just like Lego blocks or an Erector Set, experiments are done with form in mind, and the functionality follows. For example, a microscope built with Optoform both functions and looks like a microscope. Optical experiments which are set up on traditional optical tables are far from becoming usable instruments. Optoform allows optical engineers and researchers to make self-contained instrument- like results, without having to machine any custom parts.  History, and advancement of the Optical Erector Set The advancement of optical erector set perhaps began with educational toys designed for children. These injection molded plastic kits allowed the child to construct various optical instruments such as a Telescope, microscope, and spectroscope. Perhaps the most advanced erector set for optics was introduced by Spindler & Hoyer in Germany called: Microbench, patent number 2636657 filed on July 13, 1976. It consisted of 40x40 mm square mounting plates with 25 or 30 mm holes at the center, and four 6 mm bores around the edges. If four 6 mm rods were secured on the corners, a second mounting plate could slide along the rods, and secured at any point via set screws. Furthermore, by securing individual lenses within each mounting plate, a telescope could be constructed. A larger system was introduced by Spindler & Hoyer for constructing larger optical experiments: Patent number 3,945,600 filed on Mar 23, 1976. This was called Macrobench which consisted of 150x150 mm mounting plates capable of securing up to 110 mm optical elements. The rods were of course bigger (20 mm in diameter), and were hollow inside. Ith combining these mounting plates much higher precision optical experiments could have been constructed such as an interferometer, etc. A later system was introduced in 1994 called Optoform invented by Ali Afshari, Patent number PCT/US1994/011472 filed on October 20, 2004. This design consisted of round mounting plates, and it allowed cost effective manufacturing by CNC lathes with live tooling. With a circular shape, Optoform was less labor-intensive to manufacture. (This is in contrast with the traditional square mounts of prior art, which require all four sides to be machined in order to achieve precise right angles at all corners.) While a square shape limits the angles at which the plates can be mounted together, the circular shape allows the plates to be mounted at many angles. Mounting plates are conventionally fastened together by means of screws. Therefore, all four sides of square plates have to be provided with some threaded bores, whether it is(the bores) used in every assembly or not. Further, the plates are joined together with corner connectors, which must have an equal number of bores through which the screws are secured. In Optoform, the threaded bores are placed in the corner connectors, and therefore, it can be utilised only when it's needed. This scheme further reduces the manufacturing cost. In conventional square design, optical components must be held at four points since the retaining screws must be placed on each side of the plates. In Optoform, the three-point positional adjustment allows easier removal of the optical component. In 1995, Thorlabs, simplified the Microbench design by removing the coner-connector bores, and offered it at a cheaper price. It was called the Cage System. This made the product much more widely used around the world. Today, Microbench, Optoform, and the cage system are utilized in many educational, and research labs for rapid prototyping of new ideas, and optical setups. Because the \\"Self Holding\\" nature of these products, they are ideal for marketing custom optical instrumentation at much lover cost.  Applications  Optoform has been used by well known research centres and universities around the world to construct spectroscopy experiments, third harmonic generation microscopy, fibre optics setups, biomedical instruments, eye surgery apparatus, telescopes, stellar interferometers, imaging systems, vacuum experiments, etc.  Inventor  Optoform system was invented by Ali Afshari, born in Kashan, Iran. He was granted a PCT patent in 1998. Prior to inventing Optoform, he worked at Teledyne systems, Nasa‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the Hubble Space Telescope, and the Cassini project. He is the author of a number of books on Opto-mechanical design of cameras.

The first remote tower implementation providing aerodrome ATS was approved and introduced into operations in Sweden in April 2015, with further implementations in other EASA Member States well underway. (EASA, 2017) Concept The air traffic control officer (ATCO) or aerodrome flight information services officer (AFISO) will be re-located to a remote tower centre (RTC) from where they will provide the ATS. The RVT concept is aiming at providing: * Remote tower services at small and medium size airports, by personnel located at a remote tower centre somewhere else. * Contingency services at major airports, in the case of fire or other events which could take place at the control tower building. The contingency facility should be at safe, nearby, but different physical location. * Synthetic augmentation of vision to increase situational awareness at airports during poor visibility conditions at the local airport control tower facilities. The full range of air traffic services defined in ICAO Documents 4444,http://www.icao.int 9426 and EUROCONTROL's Manual for AFIShttp://www.eurocontrol.int/airspace/public/standard_page/1464_Library.html will still be provided remotely by an ATCO or AFISO. The airspace users should be provided with the appropriate level of services as if the ATS were provided locally at the airport. The SESAR Joint Undertaking projects are looking at RVT concepts, based on either one person controlling one airport, or one person controlling multiple airports. Technology The basic concept, formerly known as virtual towers, was introduced by Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. (DLR) in 2002 and describes a remote ATC control room with video-sensor based surveillance instead of 'out-of-the-window' view from a real tower.Wettbewerb der Visionen 2001-2004 The initial trials of remote ATS, for low and medium-density airports, have been based on optical sensors (cameras), providing the ATCOs at the RTC with a high-quality real-time image of the runway, the airport ramp (APRON) and the very nearby airspace. These real-time images are displayed at large monitors providing up to 360-degree view. Beside the live video feed from the airport, the ATCOs have available the same air traffic management computer systems as they would have in a local control tower building, being voice communication systems, meteorological systems, flight plan systems, and Surveillance display systems. The level of equipage might depend on whether it is a controlled TWR service, or a Flight Information Service being provided at the specific airport. Depending on the complexity of the airport, the traffic densities, and weather conditions, it might be preferable to complement the optical images with an advanced surface movement guidance and control system (A-SMGCS) with signal inputs from surface movement radar (SMR) and/or Local Area Multilateration (LAM). Development and validation The RVT concept is under development, besides of other former research & development initiatives (e.g. by DLR, DFS, LFV, Searidge Technologies, SAAB, FREQUENTIS, Indra Sistemas or the FP6 EU project ART, etc.), as part of the SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU), where work package 6http://www.sesarju.eu/programme/workpackages/wp-6-airport-operations--193 develops the operational concepts, while Work Package 12http://www.sesarju.eu/programme/workpackages/wp-12-airport-systems--199 develops the corresponding technology to enable the RVT functionality. There will be carried out live SESAR validation trials at a few selected airports in Germany, Spain (ENAIRE), Norway (Avinor) and Sweden (Luftfartsverket) as part of SESAR Joint Undertaking Projects 06.08.04 and 06.09.03 during the years 2012‚Äì2015. Airservices Australia intends to evaluate RVT technology from Saab Group at Alice Springs airport in Central Australia from late 2012, with the control centre placed in Adelaide.http://www.canso.org/cms/showpage.aspx?id=2889 In March 2009, Saab Group and Luftfartsverket (LFV) carried out a live shadow mode demonstration of their existing remote tower concept.http://www.canso.org/cms/showpage.aspx?id=425 This demonstration took place at a remote tower centre facility established at Malm√∂ air traffic control centre (ATCC), controlling a flight in and out of Angelholm airport (ICAO:ESTA) in southern Sweden. As a contingency mechanism during this trial, the local control tower at Angelholm was staffed by ATCOs. In 2010 DLR carried out the first human in the loop remote tower center simulation, whereas a remote controller operated traffic at two different low frequented airports simultaneously. Despite several biases the controllers' situation awareness was over-average and their workload remained in average range and operational feasibility could be shown the first time. DLR Institute of Flight Guidance, Saab Group, Luftfartsverket, Indra and DFS have been the major driving forces behind the Remote Tower development, and are all represented in the SESAR Joint Undertaking projects, SAAB through North European ATM Industry Group (NATMIG) and LFV NORACON. During ATC Global in Amsterdam in March 2011, SESAR Joint Undertaking had a ceremony where Project 6.9.3 'Remote & Virtual Tower' was given the award for 'most advanced for deployment'.http://www.sesarju.eu/news-press/news/sesar-awards-770 The price was presented by Executive Director of SESAR Joint Undertaking Mr Patrick Ky, and received by Project 6.9.3 Project Manager Mr G√∂ran Lindqvist, NORACON. RVT in operation As of 21 April 2015 12:00 am, the airport of √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik/Gide√• (OER/ESNO) is run using remote ATC services from Sundsvall/Midlanda (SDL/ESNN). This is reported to be the first production deployment of RVT in the world.http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=110&artikel;=6146607http://www.gizmag.com/saab- remote-tower-system/37191/ The system was tested at Leesburg Executive Airport in summer 2015.http://www.leesburgva.gov/government/departments/airport/remote-air- traffic-control-tower A new airport (SCR/ESKS) was opened in Sweden in December 2019 without any tower, the first one with only virtual tower. On 1 October 2015 the FAA announced Fort Collins-Loveland Municipal Airport as the first official FAA approved Virtual Air Traffic Control Tower test site in the United States. The equipment necessary for the testing is expected to be installed at the Fort Collins-Loveland Municipal Airport by spring of 2016, with initial testing and assessments of the new virtual technology commencing shortly thereafter. Possible benefits The main benefits of RVT is expected to be on cost efficiency. The cost savings originate from the following factors: * No need to build and maintain control tower buildings and facilities at the local airports * More efficient use of human resources (ATCOs and AFISOs), especially by serving multiple airports with medium to low traffic levels from a centralised location * Reduced need to establish and maintain ATM systems locally at the airports. By using data communication networks from the local airport to the remote tower centre, several technical systems can be centralised, hence costs savings are possible There is also a great potential to better and more cost efficiently serve flights which either are scheduled outside the core opening hours of the airport, or by being able to serve non-scheduled traffic (ambulance flights and search-and-rescue helicopters) with an air traffic service during night time when a smaller airports would normally be closed.  Standardisation  In 2014 the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) founded the Working Group (WG) 100 \\"Remote and Virtual Tower\\". The WG-100 was launched under the Chair of the German Aerospace Center - DLR and EUROCONTROL in the Secretary role. WG-100 further consists of active contributors (air navigation service manufacturers & service providers) from more than 30 companies worldwide and acts in close coordination with EASA, ICAO, SESAR, and the most recent SESAR2020 project \\"PJ05 Remote Tower\\". The group was tasked as a first step to develop standards for remote towers optical systems. In September 2016 the ED-240 Minimum Aviation System Performance Specification for Remote Tower Optical Systems document was published. These MASPS are applicable to all optical sensor configurations (visible, as well as infrared spectrum) to be used for the implementation of the remote provision of ATS to an aerodrome, encompassing the whole chain from sensor to display. This standard should help vendors and customers to quantify an optimal operational system performance and to verify it in a standardised way. For the time being the WG-100 work focuses on an extension of the current MASPS (revision A) to include 'visual tracking' and automatic Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera object following technologies. 'Visual tracking' is understood as the augmentation of the display of objects on the visual presentation by using information obtained only by image processing of the video from the optical sensors for the purpose of increasing the operator's situation awareness. The PTZ Object Following function attaches the PTZ camera to a moving target and persistently follows and displays it automatically. The MASPS ED-240A are expected to be published by 2018. Disruptive technology While some may argue, there are strong similarities between the concept of RVT, and the criteria for disruptive innovations as defined by Clayton Christensen and Michael Raynor in the book \\"Innovators Solution\\". A closer examination of the technology and its practical use would indicate that it is more appropriately categorized as a sustainable innovation, marking an evolution in aerodrome control by supplanting visual observation with a surveillance system.

He was elected to represent the riding of Prince George‚ÄîPeace River in the 2011 election, and re-elected in the 2015 election, and the 2019 Canadian federal election, as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. He served in both the 41st Parliament as part of the governing party, and 42nd Parliament as part of the official opposition. He has introduced one piece of legislation, the private member bill Bill C-346 An Act to amend the Firearms Act (licences) which would have eliminated the expiry of firearms licences, with a mandatory provision that the licence holder update his or her relevant information every 10 years, but the bill was defeated at second reading. Zimmer, a former carpenter, Fort St. John high school teacher, and a rugby enthusiast, first became involved with federal politics with the Reform Party of Canada.  Background  Zimmer was born in Dawson Creek and grew up in Fort St. John. After graduating from North Peace Secondary School in 1986, he worked as a welder's assistant in the oil industry. Through the Northern Lights College he became a journeyman carpenter and operated a small construction business between 1995 and 1998. In the 1990s he moved to the Fraser Valley to play in the British Columbia Rugby Union. Between 1999 and 2003 he attended Trinity Western University, where he coached varsity rugby and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Human Kinetics. He completed a 12-month teaching degree at the University of British Columbia and moved back to Fort St. John where he accepted a teaching job at the North Peace Secondary School.  Political career  Zimmer joined the Reform Party of Canada in 1988. He has cited Ralph Klein and Preston Manning as his political role models. While living in Abbotsford he campaigned for Randy White who was elected as a Reform Party member of parliament. Back in Fort St. John he joined the Conservative Party Prince George-Peace River Electoral District Association and worked as its president until 2009 when he became its secretary and CEO. After long-time Member of Parliament Jay Hill announced he would not seek re-election an election was held for the riding's Conservative Party nomination. In August 2010 Zimmer resigned from his duties in the Electoral District Association and announced he would stand in the nomination election. Five other people stood in the election, including fellow Fort St. John teacher Dan Davies and the former mayor of Prince George Colin Kinsley. With 1,350 votes cast in the March 2011 preferential vote, Zimmer won the nomination in the sixth round.  Member of Parliament  The next federal election was held in May 2011, when Zimmer faced former provincial politician Lois Boone for the NDP, Prince George lawyer Ben Levine for the Liberal Party of Canada, and physiotherapist Hilary Crowley for the Green Party. During the campaign Zimmer said he would advocate for reduced spending until the federal budget was balanced but also lobby to direct federal funds to widen Highways 2 and the Alaska Highway to four lanes between the Alberta border and Fort St. John. He noted that he believed pensions for former politicians were too high and that he would seek pension reform. Zimmer won the election with 62.12 per cent of the vote. During the 2015 federal election, Zimmer opposed another study into murdered and missing Aboriginal women during a heated local candidates debate, saying 42 previous studies had already been done and that a primary problem, as stated in the RCMP report, was economic status or lack of a job. After the debate, the Union of BC Indian Chiefs called for Zimmer to step down as a candidate. Zimmer had stated that, \\"One of the major drivers of missing and murdered aboriginal women is the lack of economic activity, or simply put, the lack of a job. ‚Ä¶ Ultimately, when people have a job, they're not in despair. They can stay on reserve, and that's where we want them to be, we want them to be happy where they live.\\" President of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs, Grand Chief Stewart Philip, characterized Zimmer's remarks as \\"simplistic\\" and \\"unacceptable\\". Zimmer later clarified his comments, stating that he was referencing the RCMP's report on Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women which lists employment status as one of the risk factors of murdered Aboriginal women. Zimmer went on to say that, \\"I absolutely care about missing and murdered Aboriginal women and want to see it stopped. I have a wife and a daughter and a mother and it is a tragedy that we need to fix.\\" Zimmer was re- elected with over 50% of the vote, and his Conservative Party formed the Official Opposition for the 42nd Canadian Parliament. Zimmer was appointed to be the deputy critic of Families, Children and Social Development (to Karen Vecchio). In May 2016, Zimmer sponsored and brought forward in the House of Commons a petition with 25,000 signatures advocating for the de-restriction of the AR-15 semi-automatic modern sporting rifle. A month later, when that weapon was used in the Orlando nightclub shooting, the petition and Zimmer's advocacy were criticized. In the May 2017 Conservative Party leadership election Zimmer endorsed Andrew Scheer. Following Scheer's victory, he moved Zimmer to deputy critic of the Treasury Board. On April 6, 2017, Zimmer introduced his first private member bill, Bill C-346 An Act to amend the Firearms Act (licences) which would eliminate the expiry of firearms licences, with a mandatory provision that the licence holder update his or her relevant information every 10 years. The bill was debated but defeated at the second reading stage in November 2017 with only the Conservative Party voting in favour. In October 2019 he was re-elected again, this time with just shy of 70% of the vote. On November 29 Andrew Scheer named him to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Minister for Northern Affairs and Northern Economic Development Agency.

In early April 2018, the company sold to a group of investors, WC IPA LLC following a foreclosure by the company‚Äôs principal lender, Comerica Bank. Starting in 2013 it began expanding, seeking to cover all 50 US states and to export as well. It acquired another company, Alpine Beer Company, 2014, and opened an East Coast brewery in 2016. However it financed the expansion with loans, and in the face of competition from local craft breweries it was not able to keep up with its payments. The company tried to shrink to control its costs but by April 2018 its lender foreclosed, and the company was sold to a private investor group. History Green Flash was founded in 2002 by Mike and Lisa Hinkley.Lou Hirsh, \\"Green Flash Brewing Names Ross as COO,\\" San Diego Business Journal, September 3, 2015. Chuck Silva was brought on as brewmaster in 2004. During his 11-year tenure, Silva created a number of beers, including the West Coast IPA in 2005 and Le Freak in 2006. He left in September 2015 to open his own brewery Silva Brewing,http://www.sanluisobispo.com/entertainment/restaurants/article65904552.html and Erik Jensen was promoted from head brewer to brewmaster. In June 2011, Green Flash moved from its original brewery in Vista, California, to its new 44,000 square-foot brewing facility in San Diego's Mira Mesa neighborhood. In March 2013, Green Flash announced that it would open a second brewery in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with a capacity of 100,000 barrels per year, which would make it the third-largest brewery in Virginia.Greg Kitsock, \\"Green Flash announces East Coast brewery in Virginia Beach,\\" Washington Post, March 14, 2013. It took out a $20 million loan in order to build it. In July 2014, Green Flash partnered with Belgium-based St. Feuillien Brewery to brew and sell the West Coast IPA in Europe, making Green Flash the first American craft brewery to brew, bottle and distribute its IPA throughout Europe.Jason Morgan, \\"Green Flash Brewing Co., Brewery St-Feuillien announce partnership to brew, bottle and distribute in Belgium,\\" Craft Brewing Business, July 24, 2014. In November 2014, Green Flash acquired Alpine Beer Company, with Alpine co-founders Pat and Val McIlhenney retaining control of their brews. Green Flash had been producing kegs of Alpine's Hoppy Birthday, Nelson and Duet starting in 2013, enabling Alpine to double its output to 3,000 barrels a year. The acquisition allowed Alpine to increase production and expand nationally, beyond California, beginning in late 2015.Keith Grauman, \\"Alpine Beer Company Launches in Minnesota,\\" Growler Magazine, May 13, 2015.Chris Rov Costa, \\"Brew Times Two Green Flash Brewing Co.

In 2015, Green Flash opened Cellar 3, a facility and tasting room featuring barrel-aged and bottle-conditioned beers, located in Poway, California. By March 2016 it was the 37th largest brewery in the United States by sales volume. The Virginia Beach brewery opened in November 2016, and doubled Green Flash's nationwide supply of beer, and helped move the beer to the East Coast market more efficiently. It produced the same beers and have the same equipment as the company's San Diego brewery.\\"Green Flash to Open Memorial Day Weekend in VA Beach,\\" Veer Magazine, January 15, 2016. In January 2018, in the face of competition from other craft breweries, the company withdrew distribution from 32 states and cut 15% of its employees. In February 2018 it was looking for financing to restructure its debt. At the end of March 2018 it closed Cellar 3, put its Virginia Beach brewery up for sale, and stopped distributing in 10 more states. In early April, the company said that its main lender, Comerica Bank, had foreclosed on a defaulted $20 million loan and had sold the company to a group of private investors, which intended to bring in new management. In June 2018, the brewery opened Green Flash Brewhouse & Eatery in Lincoln, Nebraska, across from the University of Nebraska campus. The brewpub will serve Green Flash and Alpine offerings as well as a full menu.

In 2005 she sent in a demo tape to Ryuichi Sakamoto's \\"Radio Sakamoto\\" Audition Corner and caught Sakamoto's interest. She released her first single in November 2006. Biography Kotringo's signature, 2016 http://kotringo.net/ktrng/profile/#english Early years Kotringo was born in Osaka. She later moved west to Fukuoka, and then back east to Nagoya after she finished her fifth year of elementary school.http://www.asahi.com/and_w/articles/SDI2017112479401.html?iref=andw_pc_kiji_backnum_article_02 Kotringo started playing the piano at age five, and began composing music at age seven. The first song she wrote was named \\"A Kitten's Nap\\" (Â≠êÁå´„ÅÆ„Å≤„Çã„Å≠; Koneko no Hiru Ne). Musical education After graduating from high school, Kotringo entered the Koyo Music School in Kobe. In 1999, she was accepted by the Berklee College of Music, where she majored in Jazz Composition and Performance. At Berklee, Kotringo received numerous awards, including the piano department's Achievement Award. During this time, she took part in the recording of the album \\"Finder's Keepers\\", with the Contemporary Jazz Big Bang led by Michael MacAllister, a classmate, accomplished guitar player, and recipient of numerous awards, including the ASCAP Foundation Young Composer Award. Kotringo performed for three years as an accompanist for the voice department at Berkelee and as a pianist for a church in Boston. After receiving her degree in 2003, she moved to New York and spent a year performing at Detour, Garage, Kaveha's and St. Nicks. Back in Japan In the fall of 2005, Kotringo began to work in finding a way to express her own music with her voice, piano and her MacBook. The following March, a composition she sent to Ryuichi Sakamoto's \\"Radio Sakamoto\\" Audition Corner (broadcast on J-WAVE, a Tokyo-based FM station covering the Kanto Region) caught Sakamoto's attention. Later, a second single she submitted to the program, \\"Nichiyo Machi\\" (Waiting for a Sunday) was broadcast on air. These events lead her to participation in the LOHAS Classical Concert in Kyoto produced by Ryuichi Sakamoto in June, 2006. Recording career In November of the same year, she made her debut with the release of her first single, the Ryuichi Sakamoto-produced Konnichiwa, Mata Ashita, a tie-in song for the Gekkeikan company's \\"Tsuki\\" commercial. Sakamoto was impressed by the multitude of Kotringo's talents: the originality of composition, the superb performance on piano, her pure and virginal singing voice crossed with sounds of electronica, all combined to give the effect of visual imagery coming to life from actual pages of a musical score... just like looking at a picture book. Since 2007 she has released seven original albums (songs in the birdcage, nemurugirl, sweet nest, trick & tweet, La memoire de mon bandwagon, Tsubame Novelette, and birdcore!), two cover albums (picnic album 1 & 2), and five soundtracks (Bear's School - Jackie & Katie, BECK, I Have to Buy New Shoes, Gourmet Girl Graffiti, and In This Corner of the World). The trick & tweet album from 2009 featured, as a bonus track, Children's World („Åì„Å©„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åõ„Åã„ÅÑ; Kodomo no sekai), the ending theme song to the 2009 animated movie Mai Mai Miracle. About the name The name ‚ÄúKotringo‚Äù is a combination of sounds taken from the Japanese words for small birds (kotori) and apple (ringo). The name comes from the fact that Kotringo had always kept a pet bird since childhood, and because she used to eat an apple every day. The computer she uses in composing music has a related brand name.

Operating at Sirius XM channel 143 (and in northern Utah on 107.9, 89.1 MHz, and HD-2), it is known on-air as BYU Radio. The station features entertaining and informational talk programming.http://www.byuradio.org/about/ History Prior to 2002, there was a satellite music format known as 'Bonneville International LDS Radio Network.' When Bonneville International decided to discontinue the format, it gave the station to BYU. The university continued adding programming to the station. BYU Radio launched as a streaming radio on August 1, 2002. The original format featured a selection of music by artists who were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and alumni of Brigham Young University. A second stream, called BYU Radio Instrumental, launched in 2003. A third stream, BYU Radio International, launched in 2008 featuring Spanish- and Portuguese-language programming. In 2006, KBYU-FM added a simulcast of BYU Radio on its HD Radio subchannel. BYU Radio expanded its reach by finalizing an agreement with Dish Network to broadcast its programming on Channel 980. This is available to subscribers to the 'Top 120' or higher programming tier.http://www.byuradio.org/about/ On July 1, 2011, BYU Radio dropped its Church of Jesus Christ of latter-Day Saints themed inspirational music format and relaunched as a national talk- format station. BYU Radio began broadcasting on Sirius XM satellite radio, assigned to channel 143 on both the Sirius and XM lineup. On October 17, 2011, BYU discontinued two of its Internet streams: BYU Radio International and BYU Radio Instrumental. The university said listeners would stream the music as background music causing high bandwidth costs for BYU. Those two services were not broadcast on Dish or SiriusXM, and were only available online. On August 9, 2016, Greg Wrubell joined BYU as the Director of Broadcast Media. Among his responsibilities were moving BYU athletics flagship from KSL to BYU Radio and making his coaches shows turn into a TV/radio simulcast for BYUtv and the Nu Skin BYU Sports Network radio affiliates. With his new responsibilities at BYU Wrubell left KSL, though KSL remained part of the BYU Sports Networks affiliates. With the change BYU Radio officially became the flagship station for football, women's soccer, and men's basketball broadcasts, though ESPN 960 remains the flagship carrier of women's soccer matches that conflict with football or men's basketball broadcasts. On October 23, 2017, Brigham Young University announced that KBYU-FM would drop its classical music programming and become a full-time carrier of BYU Radio beginning June 30, 2018. However, on April 26, 2018, BYU backtracked on the plans following listener criticism of the planned flip, and announced its planned purchase of 107.9 KUMT to serve as a full-time outlet. Programming The talk format reaches into Brigham Young University's depth of academic experts and topics. The station's slogan, \\"Together,\\" reflects the station's mission to address the broad spectrum of listeners and their beliefs, bringing together all walks of life who have a desire to do good. The station also carries inspirational programming, including BYU's campus devotionals live on Tuesdays, and Sunday programming consisting of audio from BYU Television programs and from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, including the long-running radio program Music and the Spoken Word.http://www.siriusxm.com/byuradio During the regular sports season, BYU Radio broadcasts live coverage of BYU football, women's soccer, and men's basketball games through the Nu Skin BYU Sports Network. The station also airs some BYU baseball (simulcast from ESPN 960) and airs some women's basketball games live. The station streams online, and is also simulcast on TuneIn.

History Detail of one of the women at the pit, perhaps a portrait of Simonetta Vespucci On 27 October 1480, Botticelli, together with other Florentine painters, left for Rome where he had been called as part of the reconciliation project between Lorenzo de' Medici, the de facto ruler of Florence, and Pope Sixtus IV. The Florentines started to work in the Sistine Chapel as early as the Spring of 1481, along with Pietro Perugino, who was already there. The theme of the decoration was a parallel between the Stories of Moses and those of Christ, as a sign of continuity between the Old and the New Testament ‚Äì a continuity also between the divine law of the Tables and the message of Jesus, who, in turn, chose Peter (the first alleged bishop of Rome) as his successor: this would finally result in a legitimation of the latter's successors, the popes of Rome. Botticelli, helped by numerous assistants, painted three scenes. On 17 February 1482 his contract was renovated, including the other scenes to complete the chapel's decoration. However, on 20 February his father died: he returned to Florence, where he remained. Description Detail of Moses removing his shoes The fresco shows several episodes of Moses' youth, taken from Exodus. It parallels the fresco on the opposite wall, also by Botticelli, which depicts the Temptations of Jesus. The frieze has the inscription TEMPTATIO MOISI LEGIS SCRIPTAE LATORIS. On the right is Moses killing the Egyptian who had harassed a Hebrew, and fleeing to the desert (a parallel with the episode of Jesus defeating the Devil). In the next episode Moses fights the shepherds who were preventing Jethro's daughters (including his future wife, Zipporah) to water their cattle at the pit, and then takes the water for them. In the third scene, in the upper left corner, Moses removes his shoes and then receives from God the task to return to Egypt and free his people. Finally, in the lower left corner, he drives the Jews to the Promised Land. Moses is always distinguishable in the scenes by his yellow dress and the green cloak.

It functions as a siderophore, a small chelating agent with a high affinity for iron. Siderophores are deployed as ion scavengers for microbes. Siderophores solubilize compounds by forming strong complexes. PDTC is secreted by the soil bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri and Pseudomonas putida. Synthesis and biosynthesis PDTC can be synthesized by treating the pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (or its diacid dichloride) with H2S in dry pyridine: :NC5H3(COOH)2 \\\\+ 2 H2S ‚Üí NC5H3(COSH)2 \\\\+ 2 H2O This produces an orange 1:1 pyridinium salt of 2,6-pyridinedicarbothioate. Treatment of this salt with acid give PDTC, which can then be extracted with dichloromethane. The biosynthesis of PDTC remains unclear although some insights can be deduced from the genetics. It is suggested that Pseudomonas stutzeri may have acquired at least one of the genes by lateral transfer from mycobacteria. In a proposed biosynthetic sequence pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, a known bacterial metabolite, is activated as its bis-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) derivative. The sulfur donor and its activation remain uncertain. Coordination chemistry PDTC binds to both Fe2+ and Fe3+. The ferric complex is brown, whereas the ferrous complex is blue. In the presence of air, the ferrous complex oxidizes to the ferric compound.Ockels, W., Roemer, A., Budzikiewicz, H., Korth, H., Pulverer, G., \\"Bacterial constituents. II.

The factions conducted parallel primaries but Independent National Electoral Commission recognised the candidates produced by Yari's faction. But Marafa had argued that the party did not conduct valid primaries and challenged the legality of the primaries purportedly conducted by Yari's faction up to the Supreme Court. On 24 May, the court ruled that the primaries conducted by Yari's faction were illegal and annulled it invalidating the election of all APC candidates in the 2019 general elections in Zamfara State.

History On 27 October 1480 Rosselli, together with other Florentine painters, left for Rome, where he had been called as part of the reconciliation project between Lorenzo de' Medici, the de facto ruler of Florence, and Pope Sixtus IV. The Florentines started to work in the Sistine Chapel as early as the Spring of 1481, along with Pietro Perugino, who was already there.

Due to the commission's size, the artists brought with them numerous assistants. Rosselli brought his son-in-law Piero di Cosimo. According to the Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari, Rosselli was considered one of the less gifted among the painters at the Sistine Chapel, and his paintings in the chapel were the subject of the other artists' irony. However, his sheer adoption of brilliant colors granted him the appreciation of the pope, who apparently, was not considered an art expert. Description The scene is part of the Stories of Jesus cycle and, like the others, shows more than one episode at the same time. The frieze has the inscription REPLICATIO LEGIS EVANGELICAE A CHRISTO ('Repetition of the Evangelical Law by Christ'). The supper is set in a semi-circular apse, with a horseshoe-shaped table at whose center sits Jesus, the apostles at his side. Judas, as usual, is depicted on the side, from behind; the fighting cat and dog are elements which further stress his negative connotation. The scene shows the moment immediately after Jesus' annunciation that one apostle would betray him. His hearers' reactions include touching their own chests, or muttering to each other. Detail. The table has no meals, but a single chalice in front of Jesus; some gilded or silvered kitchenware is shown in the foreground, an example of still life inspired by contemporary Flemish painting and widespread in Florentine art at the time. At the sides, are two couples of figures dressing rich garments. Another dog is jumping on the left. Within the three windows behind the table are three scenes of the Passion: the Prayer at Gethsemane, the Arrest of Jesus and the Crucifixion. These are attributed by some authorities to Biagio d'Antonio. Perugino used the same panel-within-a- panel effect in his later Last Supper.

Life Sid Grossman was the younger son of Morris and Ethel Grossman. He attended the City College of New York and worked on a WPA street crew.Grossman, Sid and Lampell, Millard. Journey to the Cape In 1934, he started what would become the Photo League with co-founder Sol Libsohn. Grossman played numerous roles throughout the Photo League's existence (1936‚Äì1951) including educator, administrator, reviewer, editor of Photo Notes and founder of Chelsea Document (1938-1940), an indictment of obsolete buildings and substandard living conditions in a New York neighborhood. He enlisted on March 6, 1943 and served in the Sixth Army in Panama during World War II. Grossman's 1940 photographs of labor union activity led to FBI investigations and the blacklisting of the Photo League as a communist front in 1947. In 1949, he opened a photography school in Provincetown, Massachusetts, although he continued to live and teach in NYC part of every year. Grossman was married twice: to Marion Hille and then to Miriam Grossman. Grossman died from a heart attack in 1955. His book, Journey to the Cape, coauthored with Millard Lampell, was published posthumously, in 1959.  Politics and aesthetics  Even though the actual date of his joining the Communist Party is not known, his membership in it was never in doubt.Tucker, Anne Wilkes. ‚ÄúA Rashomon Reading‚Äù Klein and Evans The Radical Camera p. 81 In 1936, his nickname at the Photo League was ‚ÄúCommissar‚Äù for his dogmatic opposition to the aestheticism of some of the members.Klein, Mason. ‚ÄúOf Politics and Poetry: The Dilemma of the Photo League\\" p. 17 Prior to his enlistment in the Armed Forces, he was investigated by the FBI, U.S. Army Intelligence, and the NYC Police Department for his political affiliations.Tucker, Anne Wilkes. ‚ÄúA Rashomon Reading‚Äù Klein and Evans The Radical Camera p. 80 However, by 1946 and his discharge from the armed forces, Grossman was ready to break from Stalinism and the Communist Party. As Mason Klein observed, ‚ÄúGrossman's major formal breakthrough occurred when he was in the air force, stationed in Panama...‚ÄùKlein, Mason. ‚ÄúOf Politics and Poetry: The Dilemma of the Photo League\\" p. 23 There he was away from the Party and the day-to-day affairs of The Photo League, and he used the opportunity ‚Äúto experiment and move on.‚Äù He ‚Äúbegan to challenge the honest and straight documentary approach that he had long espoused.‚ÄùKlein, Mason. ‚ÄúOf Politics and Poetry: The Dilemma of the Photo League\\" p. 24 He began using a Speed Graphic 4x5 camera and changed his technique. He started to photograph at night and worked to achieve startling effects by moving his camera and manipulating his prints. Grossman's photographic point of view and the images he created in the late 1940s bore little if any resemblance to those of the ‚ÄúCommissar‚Äù of the early 1930s. None of which had any bearing on the decisions of U.S. Attorney General Tom C. Clark and House Un-American Activities Committee to deem the photographer and the organization he helped to create as ‚Äúsubversive.‚Äù Grossman resigned from the Photo League in 1949; the Photo League disbanded on October 30, 1951.Tucker, Anne Wilkes. ‚ÄúA Rashomon Reading‚Äù Klein and Evans The Radical Camera p. 72  Photography  Grossman conducted workshops at the Photo League, the Henry St. Settlement, the Harlem Art Center, and privately in NYC and Provincetown, for almost twenty years. The photographers he taught were many ‚Äì including Lou Bernstein, Lisette Model, Walter Rosenblum, Louis Stettner, Helen Gee, Arthur Leipzig (who is on record as calling Grossman ‚Äúprobably the most fantastic teacher I ever knew‚Äù) and Leon Levinstein. Yet Grossman himself said, ‚ÄúI am not an instructor in any classical sense.‚Äù He insisted that his students take on the responsibility for making something of themselves. According to Jewish Museum curator Mason Klein, ‚ÄúGrossman increasingly insisted on the idea of being in the world in a particular manner, engaging with a certain consciousness as a photographer, and connecting to the camera in ways that made photographers question who they were.‚ÄùKlein, Mason. ‚ÄúOf Politics and Poetry: The Dilemma of the Photo League‚Äù p. 22 One had to ‚Äúlive for photography,‚Äù in effect transforming and liberating oneself ‚Äì in order to become a good photographer. One description of Grossman's ‚Äúimpassioned, often aggressive workshop critiques‚Äù has been provided by one of his students, N. Jay Jaffee, who studied with him in 1948. On the one hand, ‚ÄúHe was almost contemptuous; each of us got a taste of his anger and hostility during the course.‚Äù Yet, ‚ÄúHis genius was in expounding a philosophy of photography that was unique. I had never heard anyone speak on a subject with such depth and enthusiasm. I still recall a phrase he repeated several times: 'The world is a picture.' This simple statement was a profound insight into the method and meaning of photography.‚Äù ‚ÄúTo Sid, photography was serious, not sacred.‚Äù Grossman's first wife, Marion Hille, remarked that he ‚Äúencouraged his students 'to enjoy themselves right away, to get a feel of taking pictures without technique getting in the way.'‚Äù Jaffee reflected that, ‚ÄúPerhaps, if Sid had lived long enough, he would have also mellowed. Hopefully, he would have received the honor and respect for his brilliance and his work that he so justly deserves.‚Äù Today, almost all of the important photographers and educators he influenced and who continued his legacy are also deceased. All that is left are the photographs he and they made ‚Äì a considerable contribution.\\"  Publication  *The Life and Work of Sid Grossman. By Keith F. Davis.

Wilhelm Joseph von Wasielewski (17 June 1822 ‚Äì 13 December 1896) was a German violinist, conductor, and musicologist. Life Wasielewski was born on June 17, 1822 in the village of Gro√ü-Leesen (Polish: Le≈∫no), near Danzig as the eighth of eleven children of Henriette Christina Piwko (1788‚Äì1850) and Josef Thadd√§us von Wasielewski (1785‚Äì1850), a landholder and later Rector of the Danzig convent school of St. Brigitta. His father gave him his first lessons in playing the violin, which soon became his favorite instrument. At age 10, he began studies at Danzig's St. Peter and Paul Academy. On April 2, 1842, Wasielewski was accepted into the newly founded Leipzig Conservatory of Music, directed by Felix Mendelssohn. In addition to Mendelssohn, he studied with such renowned teachers as Robert Schumann, Moritz Hauptmann, and Ferdinand David. He joined the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in 1846 as a violinist. As a successful student, he had many avenues of opportunity, as a letter by Mendelssohn, written to Wasielewski's father on September 17, 1849, attests: > Your son has excelled from the start to gain favor amongst the pupils in the > institution through an excellent manner, through hard work and persistence, > and through unremitting zeal. His efficient and robust temper is free from > dry or affected coercion, and his musical talent and genuine love of art > leads him away from wild freedom and disorder. You have given him a proper > upbringing, which would have still have been insufficient without such > natural traits. From no direction has there been spoken even the slightest > complaint or criticism about your son. On the contrary, his progress has > been so remarkable that, for example, on the violin, the concertmaster David > recently remarked to me that your sone is already such a good and capable > musician that, should he remain in good health, nothing could stop him in > any place from gaining recognition for his own achievements and > contributions to art for its own honor. Robert Schumann called Wasielewski as concertmaster of the D√ºsseldorf Musikverein in 1850. He soon developed strong relations with the Schumanns, finding close expression though playing chamber music with them in public and private. Wasielewski found employment as a choral director in Bonn in 1852. At that time he also founded a successful piano trio with Julius Tausch and Christian Reimers. Later, he was offered leadership of the male-voice choir the Concordia Liedertafel and the orchestra of the Beethoven Society. Correspondence with the Schumanns until Robert's death in 1856 witnesses the intense friendly relations with the families. Schumann dedicated his M√§rchenbilder, Op. 113 to Wilhelm Josef and his Albumbl√§tter, Op. 124 to Alma. Unable to find a permanent position in Bonn, the family decided to move to Dresden in 1855 where they lived for fourteen years. Wilhelm Josef spent his time performing as a soloist with the orchestras in Dresden and Leipzig, gave music lessons, and continued his literary work. These years also saw the development of a personal relationship with the piano virtuoso and composer Franz Liszt, who invited Wilhelm Joseph to the Altenberg in Weimar. Wasielewski published the first biography of Schumann in 1858, which found wide recognitions and went through many editions both in Germany and abroad. The Royal library in Dresden hosted an extensive collection of old musical manuscripts and documents, leading Wasielewski to the idea of writing a treatise on the historical development of the violin and violin playing in the various styles of different European countries. This led to the publication of the landmark work, Die Violine und ihre Meister [The violin and its players] in 1868, going through nine editions, the last, as with other works by Wasielewski, revised by his son, Waldemar von Wasielewski. Wasielewski finally received an appointment as municipal music director in Bonn in 1869. His first wife, Alma, died in 1871, who was buried alongside their two sons in the old cemetery. He was appointed Royal music director in 1873. He developed good relations with composers Johannes Brahms and Max Bruch, as extensive correspondence shows. In 1874, Wasielewski, with another famous close friend, the violin virtuoso Joseph Joachim, assumed directorship of performances from Clara Schumann of a music festival to commemorate a monument erected at Robert Schumann's resting place. The monument, designed by Adolf Donndorf, was unveiled on May 2, 1880. In 1878 he was awarded an honorary membership in the Accademia Filarmonica in Bologna. At age 61, he retired to the palace town of Sondershausen, continuing his writings on music. His late publications include a biography of Beethoven and a history of the cello. He died on December 13, 1896 at age 74 in Sondershausen where he was buried. His memoirs were published in 1897. Works (Selection)  In addition to his numerous musical and historical writings, Wasielewski also published several compositions, the most prominent being his Notturno for violin (or other instrument) and piano, Op. 21, Herbstblumen (Autumn Flowers), 9 Pieces for violin or viola and piano, Op. 30, and Sedan Lied (Sedan Song), which received brief attention from Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. * Robert Schumann, Dresden (1858) * Die Violine und ihre Meister, Leipzig (1869) * Die Violine im 17.

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year.

The deposit was discovered in 1954 by a United Uranium NL exploration team, led by Joe Fischer, with a ground radiometric survey. The site was named after the daughters of a team staff member, William 'Bluey' Halpin Kay - Elvira, Sherryl and Lana. El Sherana operated from 1958 to 1959 and El Sherana West from 1961 to 1964. The site was rehabilitated between 1988 and 1992. El Sherana was the largest producer of high grade uranium ore (with minor gold and silver) amongst the mines along the South Alligator River Valley. It had underground and open-cut operations. Production from El Sherana was 38,437 long tons at a grade of 12.42 lb U3O8 per long ton (0.55% U3O8). From El Sherana West, 21,316 long tons at a grade of 18.35 lb U3O8 per long ton (0.82% U3O8) were produced. At El Sherana and El Sherana West, uranium-gold mineralisation occurs in two general settings: at or near the shallow-dipping Koolpin Formation/Coronation Sandstone unconformity, where it is cut by normal and reverse faults (El Sherana pit). The host rocks are chert-banded siltstone and carbonaceous shale adjacent to sandstone (Coronation Sandstone) and altered volcanics (Pul Pul Rhyolite), in irregular zones along the contacts between cherty ferruginous shale and carbonaceous shale (El Sherana West). The ore consisted of massive pods and disseminated veinlets of pitchblende, with secondary metatorbernite, autunite, gummite and gold, with minor pyrite, galena and chalcopyrite. Gold occurred as veinlets within pitchblende or as separate zones of mineralisation. Gold distribution extends beyond the high grade pitchblende pods that in places contain visible gold and forms an envelope around the poddy high grade uranium mineralisation, with grades of up to 0.2 ounce per ton (5.5 g/tonne).

Middleton's first three grandchildren, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis of Cambridge, are third, fourth and fifth in line to the British throne respectively. Early life Carole Middleton was born on 31 January 1955 at Perivale Maternity Hospital in Perivale, London, the daughter of Dorothy Harrison and Ronald Goldsmith; she is the older sister of IT recruitment multi-millionaire Gary Goldsmith. She spent her early years in a small house in Southall, attending the local state schools. She initially left school aged 16 but soon returned and got four A Levels. Although she wanted to be a teacher, Carole's parents \\"couldn't afford to put [her] through college\\". She then worked as a secretary and can reportedly still do Pitman Shorthand. Brushing up her French, she got a job as ground staff at British Airways where she met flight dispatcher Michael Francis Middleton. At the time of their marriage, Carole was recorded as working as a stewardess. Michael's father, Captain Peter Middleton had been Prince Philip's co-pilot in 1962. The couple were married on 21 June 1980 at the Church of St James in Dorney, Buckinghamshire. Leeds-born Michael was the grandson of Olive Middleton ‚Äì a member of the Lupton family who are described in the City of Leeds archives as being \\"landed gentry; a political and business dynasty\\". Business success and husband's inherited wealth In 1986, she and her family returned to West Berkshire, Bradfield Southend, after spending two-and- a-half years in Jordan. Her eldest daughter, Catherine, was aged four and attending the private preparatory college St Andrew's School, Pangbourne. In 1987, Middleton established Party Pieces, a company which began by making party bags and which now sells party supplies and decorations by mail order. In 1995, under the joint leadership of Carole and Michael, the firm's growth necessitated its headquarters be moved to a range of farm buildings at Ashampstead Common.Party Pieces Princess in News of the World (21 November 2010), pg. 4 The family's wealth is the result of the success of their business combined with the trust funds inherited from Olive Christiana Middleton (n√©e Lupton), whom the BBC reported in 2011 as being Michael Middleton's aristocrat grandmother. This wealth has resulted in the Middletons being reported to be multi-millionaires. Carole and her husband Michael own Bucklebury Manor, in Bucklebury, West Berkshire ‚Äì a substantial Grade II- listed Georgian manor house set on over 18 acres. The Middletons' grandson Prince George spent his first few weeks at Bucklebury Manor. In 2002, Carole and Michael Middleton bought \\"with cash\\" a flat in Chelsea, London, in which their children lived after completing their university studies. The gold chevron on the coat of arms taken out by her husband Michael is in reference to Carole's maiden name of Goldsmith. Ancestry=Royal Research revealed in 2011 that Carole Middleton's great-great-grandmother, Jane Liddle (d. 1881), was a great-great-granddaughter of Sir Thomas Blakiston Conyers, 9th Bt (1731‚Äì1810), himself a descendant of King Edward IV. It was reported in December 2014 that Sir Thomas Conyers shared a direct ancestor with Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, n√©e Bowes-Lyon (1900‚Äì2002). Their common ancestor was County Durham's Sir William Blakiston. The famous Blakiston-Bowes Cabinet, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was created to celebrate the union of the Blakiston baronets and the Bowes-Lyon family. This connection makes Carole a distant blood cousin of the Queen Mother. Other Carole's maternal great-grandfather was Durham coal miner John Harrison (1874‚Äì1956).

The park and community were founded after the purchase of the land in 1887 by members of the National Prohibition Party (serving as the party's headquarters) during a temperance movement prior to Federal prohibition in the United States, with the specification that no consumption of alcohol would be permitted in the area. At its peak the park had extended nearly 150 acres, but declined in the 1900s along with the temperance movement, with much of the land sold to non- movement members. The remaining parkland was obtained by the City in 1907, surviving as Westerleigh Park and Northerleigh Park operated by the New York City Parks Department. History The area of Prohibition Park and modern Westerleigh began as part of the 5,100 acres estate of Thomas Dongan, Colonial Governor of New York under British rule, purchased in 1683. The land was purchased in 1848 by New York politician John Vanderbilt. Between and of land were purchased from Vanderbilt's daughter in 1887 by Christopher S. Williams and Manhattan Methodist pastor William H. Boole on behalf of the National Prohibition Party. The party intended on founding a reclusive summer retreat in response to apparent widespread crime and blight in the city attributed to alcohol consumption. The park was opened on July 4, 1888, and was operated by the National Prohibition Campground Association (later the National Prohibition Park Company). In its first year of existence, 60,000 people visited the park. A 4000-seat auditorium called University Temple opened in 1891. By 1897, the park had grown to in size, with a yearly attendance of 200,000. The park consisted of campground, a picnic grove, tennis courts, ball fields, horse stables and other recreational facilities. Visitors would stay in tents anchored to wooden platforms. Any open lots not used for campsites were used for development, giving way to permanent buildings including a bowling alley, a large hotel called the Park Hotel, and several small hotels. Events at the park included temperance rallies, religious and temperance meetings, educational lectures, and Chautauqua entertainment. The park was served by a surface trolley line (operated by the Port Richmond and Prohibition Park Electric Railway Company) on Jewett Avenue beginning in 1892, originating in Port Richmond. This would connect to ferries in the northern shore of Port Richmond, or the Staten Island Railway's North Shore Branch and additional trolley service towards Saint George Terminal. Residential development In 1892, the area began transitioning into a permanent residential community. Over 1,000 building sites were created, each with a deed prohibiting the use, manufacture, or sale of liquor. Single-family homes in Victorian, Dutch, and English stylings were constructed. Streets were constructed in the neighborhood, named after prominent Prohibition figures. The Westerleigh Collegiate Association, a private school which offered education from Kindergarten to college, opened in 1895. Initially selling only to fellow temperance followers, in the 1900s the Park Company began selling lots to non-members of the movement. This, along with declining park attendance, and the destruction of the University Temple and Westerleigh Collegiate in 1903 due to separate fires, led to the decline of Prohibition Park. The community was renamed Westerleigh, and the remaining undeveloped parkland was acquired by New York City in 1907. Residents *William H. Boole, a park trustee and juryman who died there in 1896.

Construction was started in 1929 and was completed in 1937 as one of the Public Works Administration's infrastructure projects in Chicago. The bridge is officially named the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Bridge to honor the centennial anniversary of the birth of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.Chicago‚Äôs Bridges It was planned by the Chicago Plan Commission, using Hugh E. Young as the consulting engineer, was designed by the Strauss Engineering Company, built by the American Bridge Company, and erected by Ketler and Elliot Company. It crosses near the mouth of the Chicago River. Significance/purpose The bridge in 1950 View of bridge towards the Chicago Harbor Lock and Lake Michigan The building of this bridge was meant to create many jobs for Chicagoans and ease traffic flow on Michigan Avenue and in the Loop. In 1937 this structure was the longest, widest, and heaviest bascule bridge in the world. The Outer Drive itself, now known as Lake Shore Drive, links the south side to the north side of the city, running along the western shore of Lake Michigan. It extends from its origin in Jackson Park on the South Side of the city to the Loop, across this Outer Drive Bridge over the Chicago River, to its eventual terminus at Hollywood Avenue and Sheridan Road in Edgewater on the city's North Side. Funds While the completion of the Outer Drive was considered one of the most important projects in the PWA it took many years to complete. A main issue was funding. Due to a lack of provided security by Chicago Park Districts, the allotment for the bridge was revoked until the districts were all in position to comply. The total cost of the Outer Drive is estimated at $11,563,000. Economic justification Calculations based on a traffic flow of 40,000 vehicles per day on a saving of eight minutes between Oak Street and Seventh Street, made possible by the use of the bridge rather than Michigan Ave and on a delay cost estimated to be one cent per car per minute show that the saving in vehicle operation should amount to $584,000 per annum, which, capitalized at 5% would indicate that $23,360,000 could properly be spent to eliminate this delay. This shows that the Outer Drive bridge project is economically reasonable, showing a possible saving of $11,797,000. Bridge operation According to Engineering News- Record, \\"Each leaf is to be operated by two sets of gear trains, consisting of four sets of gear reductions. Each gear train is connected to two 100-horsepower main operating motors, only one of which is to be used at a time. The time required for opening or closing the bridge against a wind is stated to be 57.6 seconds, of which 10 seconds is for acceleration and 2.86 seconds for deceleration. The main operating racks are bolted to the underside of the outside trusses, the pitch radius being . The operating pinion, with a pitch diameter of , is mounted on a shaft of the gear train. Bridge raised for sailboats, viewed looking east, toward Navy Pier Heavy locking devices are provided at the center of the bridge and at the rigid in its closed position. The center lock in addition to holding the leaves together in their closed position, also transmits live load shear from one leaf to the other. This center lock consists of a set of four female castings bolted to the river end of one leaf, and a second set of four male units bolted to the river end of the other leaf, all castings being on the centerlines of the trusses. The male unit consists of two castings forming a toggle. Heel or rear locks are necessary to prevent the leaves from opening when live loads pass over the part of the bridge between the trunnions and the rear break in the floor. Each leaf is provided with two pairs of rear locks, each pair being placed between the inside and outside trusses. The four locks of a leaf are connected by shafting, and operation by means of two 15-horsepower motors set either side of the centerline of the bridge\\" (April 22, 1937).

He is perhaps best known as a major representative of the first generation of Korean minjung theologians. He was the President of the World Alliance of YMCAs from 1994 to 1998.  Minjung Theology  Suh traces the origins of minjung theology to the March First Movement of 1919, an independence movement triggered by the end of World War I and the death of King Kojong, the last king of the Yi Dynasty. It was during the 1919 independence movement when Korean minjung and Korean Christians partnered together to rise against foreign domination and liberate themselves from Japanese rule, thereby giving birth to minjung theology.Suh, 36-27 While Suh sees minjung theology as being borne from a political movement, he also clarifies that it has risen from the indigenous Korean shamanism as a religion of the poor, oppressed, and marginalized. Combined with the spiritual mindset of Korean shamanism, Suh writes that \\"For the powerless minjung, the power of the spirit, more particularly the power of the Holy Ghost, is most respected and awed. To become a Christian is to believe in the power of the Holy Ghost which is much more powerful than their shaman spirits.\\"Suh, 116 The spirituality of the minjung, then, is a spirituality that has emerged from the feelings of han‚Äîthe deep feeling of suffering and helplessness experienced by the oppressed.

She published four books and was the founder of the New York School of Expression. Early years Genevieve Stebbins was born on March 7, 1857 in San Francisco, California to James Cole Stebbins and Henrietta Smith. Her mother died when she was two years old. As a young child she always loved to dance and perform. Career=Theatre Stebbins first came to New York City from San Francisco to study for the stage, under a leading actress of Albert Marshman Palmer's Union Square Theatre. After a Winter's course of instruction, she made her debut on the stage as leading juvenile of Palmer's Company, in Rose Michel. The following year, she accepted an engagement under Dion Boucicault, and later, was playing the leading part in Our Boys at Daly's Theatre, when she met Steele MacKaye, the disciple and successor of Fran√ßois Delsarte, who persuaded her to retire from the stage and study the Delsarte System with him for two years, promising her the leading part in a play which he was writing at the time. Stebbins spent six months of this two years at the Boston University School of Oratory (later known as Boston School of Oratory), as MacKaye's representative, giving the system of Delsarte to pupils and teachers in exchange for private and class lessons in elocution from Prof. Lewis Baxter Monroe, Dean of that school. Nearly every well-known graduate of that school was under her instruction, and to her many of them were indebted for their entire knowledge of the Delsarte System. In May, 1879, Stebbins made her re-entrance on the stage as the leading lady of the Madison Square Theatre. The papers were unanimous in her praise. The following year, she accepted an engagement with Helena Modjeska's manager to play leading Shakespearian roles. In 1881, she went to Paris to study with Fran√ßois-Joseph Regnier, President of the Conservatoire and Societaire of the Theatre Francois. On her return to the United States in 1882, Stebbins read in public and accepted other theatrical engagements. Harmonic Gymnastics In 1885, Stebbins published her first book, The Delsarte System of Expression. Its immediate success decided her to become a lecturer and teacher. She became a special instructor in twenty-one New York schools, and recited and lectured in the principal cities and colleges of the United States. Feeling the need of a gymnastic system for girls that should have the charm of the dance and the physical value of the gymnasium, she elaborated a few Delsarte ideas combined with Ling aesthetic gymnastics and creative work of her own into a complete system of Harmonic Gymnastics. To perfect these gymnastic ideas, she made two more trips abroad, studied in the U.S. with Dr. George H. Taylor, author of a valuable system of medical gymnastics, and took a course in Swedish educational gymnastics, going to Harvard University in 1892 for that purpose. During her entire career she was interested in singing, and was the pupil of prominent masters, whose method she applied to training the speaking voice. Genevieve Stebbins Astley (1894) In 1893, she founded the New York School of Expression in the Carnegie Music Hall, Mr. Astley (Stebbins' husband) being the Business Manager. Her 1893 school brochure listed prior pupils including Felix Adler, of the Ethical Society; Dr. and Mrs. S. S. Curry, of the Boston School of Expression; Dr. C. W. Emerson, founder of the Emerson College of Oratory; Mary Currier, Professor of Elocution at Wellesley; Dr. Canfield, President of Columbus University, Ohio; Professor Hayes, of Harvard; Frank Stuart Parker, Georgie Cayvan, Mrs. James Brown Potter, Mrs. Pierpont Morgan, Mrs. Benjamin Church, Mrs. Vincenzo Botta, Mrs. Post, Miss Vanderbilt, Mrs. John D. Rockefeller, Mrs. Alexander, Mrs. Richard McCurdy, and others; while classes were formed by the Seidl Society, the Musical Artists' Society, the Kindergarten Society, the Ethical Society and other clubs. Steele MacKaye wrote to her when she first launched forth as a teacher: \\"You are the only one of my pupils whom I can conscientiously recommend to teach what I teach myself\\"; while Regnier wrote: \\"You have the true artistic temperament, and I confidently prophesy for you the greatest success.¬£ Later F. Townsend Southwick (former teacher of oratory at the Academy of Dramatic Arts) joined forces with Stebbins in her school as the principal. She retired from the school in 1907. Stebbins embodied her method in several books including, Delsarte System of Expression, Society Gymnastics and Voice Culture, Dynamic Breathing and Harmonic Gymnastics, Genevieve Stebbins' System of Physical Training. She completed a new edition of her first work, The Delsarte System of Expression (New York: E. S. Werner Publishing Company), with a second part consisting of lectures and added instruction, illustrated by thirty-two pictures of statues. Influence Stebbins's work created more opportunities for late nineteenth-century American women to engage in physical culture and expression, especially in the realm of dance. She provided the means, rationale, and model for what could be accepted as the appropriate practices for middle and upper-class women. Her work in the Delsarte system facilitated the new \\"modern dance\\" which would develop in the United States and Europe in the twentieth century. It may also have contributed to the 20th century development of yoga as exercise. Personal life Stebbins was married to Joseph A. Thompson from 1888 until she divorced him in 1892. Thompson was most likely a relative of Mary Thompson so after the divorce, her partnership with Mary Thompson ended. Stebbins was remarried to Norman Astley, a journalist, in April 1892.

However, there is evidence that, in recent years, the ecosystem of the lake has been stressed by outside pollution, including airborne nitrogen from agricultural activities and the more direct influence of hundreds of bathers in summer.

The fort, fully inhabited, has many period buildings of the colonial era within a network of narrow roads. History Amangalla, Fort Galle, formerly the New Oriental Hotel The complex of buildings was originally built in 1684 as the headquarters of the Dutch commanders and their staff. During the British rule, the complex was used as the quarters for their soldiers. In 1865 it was converted into the New Orient Hotel, catering to the European passengers travelling between Europe and Galle port in the 19th century. It subsequently became a heritage hotel under the Aman Resorts group of international hotels in 2005 and was renamed Amangalla.

It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument, which even after more than 432 years maintains a polished appearance, due to extensive reconstruction work done by Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka. The fort has a colourful history, and today has a multi-ethnic and multi-religious population. The Sri Lankan government and many Dutch people who still own some of the properties inside the fort are looking at making this one of the modern wonders of the world. The heritage value of the fort has been recognized by the UNESCO and the site has been inscribed as a cultural heritage UNESCO World Heritage Site under criteria iv, for its unique exposition of \\"an urban ensemble which illustrates the interaction of European architecture and South Asian traditions from the 16th to the 19th centuries.\\" The Galle Fort, also known as the Dutch Fort or the \\"Ramparts of Galle\\", withstood the Boxing Day tsunami which damaged part of coastal area Galle town. It has been since restored. Etymology There are many versions of the word ‚ÄòGalle‚Äô that is suffixed to the fort. One version is that it is a derivative of ‚ÄòGallo‚Äô from the Portuguese language, meaning \\"rooster\\". The other version is that it was a \\"galaa\\", in Sinhala meaning a \\"cattle herd\\" or place where cattle was herded. History ramparts Galle‚Äôs earliest historical existence is traced to Ptolemy‚Äôs world map of 125‚Äì150 AD when it was a busy port, trading with Greece, Arab countries, China and others. Its mention as a \\"port of call of the Levant\\" is made in the cosmography of Cosmas Indicopleustes. This is the harbour where the Portuguese, under the leadership of Louren√ßo de Almeida, made their first landing in 1505 on the island and caused a notable change in developments on the island with their close friendship with Dharmaparakrama Bahu (1484‚Äì1514), the then king of the country. Before the Portuguese arrived here, Ibn Batuta had touched base at this port. This was the beginning of the fort‚Äôs history, which was built by the Portuguese, along with a Franciscan chapel (now mostly in ruins) inside the fort in 1541. The fort also, in later years, served as prison camp to incarcerate Sinhalese natives who opposed the Portuguese. The Portuguese had moved to Colombo from Galle as they preferred the latter. In 1588, however, they were attacked by the Sinhalese King Raja Singha I (1581‚Äì93) of Sitawaka, which forced the Portuguese to return to Galle. At Galle, they initially built a small fort out of palm trees and mud. They called it the Santa Cruz, and later extended it with a watch tower and three bastions and a \\"fortalice\\" to guard the harbour. Sea side wall of the Galle Fort In 1640, the events took a turn with the Dutch entering the fray joining hands with King Rajasinhe II to capture the Galle Fort. The Dutch, with a force of some 2,500 men under Koster, captured the fort from the Portuguese in 1640 itself. Although not an ideal situation for the Sinhalese, they were instrumental in building the fort as seen in its present form in the Dutch architectural style. Fortifications were added up to the early 18th century. The establishment consisted of public administration buildings, warehouses and business houses and residential quarters. A Protestant church (planned by Abraham Anthonisz) was also built in baroque style in 1775 to cater to the colonists and the local people who were converted to Christianity. The most prominent buildings in the fort complex were the Commandant's residence, the arsenal and the gun house. Other buildings erected in the fort catered to trade and defense requirements such as workshops for carpentry, smithy, rope making and so forth. They also built an elaborate system of sewers that were flooded at high tide, taking the sewage away to sea. The British took over the fort on 23 February 1796, one week after Colombo was captured. Sri Lanka remained a British colony formally from 1815 till it became an independent island nation in 1948. The importance of Galle also declined after the British developed Colombo as their capital and main port in the mid nineteenth century.  Geography  View of the Galle Fort in Sri Lanka in 1754 Galle Fort is in Galle, which is located at the extreme southwest corner of the island, in the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, where the shoreline turns east towards Matara and Tangalle. The fort, like most of the forts in Sri Lanka, is built on a small rocky peninsula, belonging to the sea as much as to the land. As it exists today, it covers an area of . Highway A2 provides road links to Galle from Colombo (a distance of ) and the rest of the country along the west coast or from the east along the south coast. Since 2012 an expressway has linked Galle to Colombo. Rail links are also available to Colombo and Matara. Sea route is through the Galle Port at the Galle Harbour.Ellis2009,p.247 Demographics The Galle city (population 112,252, over an area of ) has developed around the Galle Fort area which covers around . The story of the fort is well illustrated by many signages and plaques, which provide information about each monument. More than half of the inhabitants inside the fort are Moor, with Sinhalese, Dutch, English, Portuguese and German settlers. More details regarding the history of the fort can be found at the visitor center and at the Dutch period museum inside the Fort. Fort layout The Main Gate to the Galle Fort The fort, originally built by the Portuguese in the 16th century to defend Galle, was an earthen structure with pallisades covering the northern inland side with a rampart and three bastions. They believed that the seaward side was impregnable and hence did not construct any fortifications on the sea side. The sea wall was an addition made in 1729 to make the city planning for defense purposes complete in all respects. When the fort came under the control of the Dutch, they considered the old fortifications built by the Portuguese unsafe as they were made of earth and palisades. Hence, the Dutch decided to fully encircle the entire peninsula by building impregnable fortifications as defense against other colonial agencies in the region. They built some 14 bastions with coral and granite stones over an area of (). Many of the fortification walls were built in 1663. The city built within the fort was well-planned with a grid layout and the peripheral roads aligned parallel to fort's ramparts. The fort has two gates. The two towering gates to the fort are termed \\"Portcullised gates\\" and the first gate of entry from the port is inscribed \\"ANNO MDCL XIX\\" which has depiction of Dutch Coat of Arms with the ubiquitous emblem of cock and an inset \\"VOC\\" inscribed in the centre. The Main Gate is along the northern stretch of the fort on the land side and is heavily fortified. The Portuguese had built a moat here which was widened during the Dutch rule by breaking the fort wall in 1667 and building the Star, Moon and Sun bastions. Its construction is also dated to the British period from 1897 to facilitate easy flow of traffic to the old town. This gate was fortified with a draw bridge surrounded by a moat; inscriptions here indicate 1669 as the year of construction. Some of the other named bastions are: The Aurora Bastion, the Tremon Bastion, the Kleipenberg Bastion and the Emaloon Bastion, adding an element of grandeur to the fort as a whole. Walking along the fort wall in a clockwise direction leads to the Old Gate where the British Coat of Arms is seen inscribed at the entrance at the top. In the inner part of the gate there is the 1668 dated inscription of the letters VOC, an abbreviation of Verenigde Oostindindische Compagnie, meaning Dutch East India Company with the insignia of a cock flanked by two lions. Further along the fort wall is the Portuguese- built oldest bastion, known as Zwart Bastion, meaning Black Bastion. The eastern section of the fort terminates in the Point Utrecht Bastion; the powder house is also seen here. The high Galle Lighthouse was erected here in 1938. The next stretch of the fort wall is the location of Flag Rock Bastion, which was used as a signaling station to warn ships entering the port of the hazardous rocky stretches of the bay. Ships were warned by firing musket shots from the Pigeon Island near the Flag Rock. Further along the fort walls is the Trion Bastion where a windmill drew water from the sea to sprinkle the dusty roads of the town; it is also a view point to watch sunsets. Many more bastions are seen along the fortifications from this location up to the Main Gate. The Fort really resembles a small laid out walled town, with a rectangular grid pattern of streets full of the low houses with gables and verandas in the Dutch colonial style. It has a well laid out road network. The fort area also has a number of historic churches, mosques, commercial and government buildings. Some of the locals stroll along the walls of the fort in the evenings. After the fort came under the control of the British in 1796, it remained their southern headquarters. They made many modifications to the fort such as closing of the moat, building of houses, a lighthouse on the Utrecht Bastion, a gate between the Moon Bastion and the Sun Bastion. A tower was particularly erected in 1883 to commemorate the jubilee of Queen Victoria. The Second World War saw many more fortifications built to defend the fort. In spite of all the changes made over the years, since it was first built between the 16th and the 19th century, the Galle Fort still remains a unique monument complex said to be \\"the best example of a fortified city with a fusion of European architecture and South Asian traditions built by Europeans in South and Southeast Asia\\". In the fort area, many buildings are of Dutch vintage with street names also in Dutch. The sewerage system built in the fort area ensured that the city sewerage was flushed into the sea during the tidal cycle. The Dutch exploited the musk rats in the sewers by exporting them to extract musk oil. Other landmarks Meera Mosque in Galle Fort Some of the important heritage monuments in the fort are the Dutch Reformed Church, with its historic belfry dated 1707 and cast in 1709, which rang every hour; the old Dutch government house; the residence of the Commander; Great Warehouse near the Old Gate, built around 1669 to store spices and ship equipment (which now houses the National Maritime Museum); the Old Dutch Hospital; the Meera Mosque built in 1904; the Buddhist temple built at the site of Portuguese Roman Catholic church; the All Saints Anglican Church built in 1871; the 1882 Clock Tower and the 1939 Galle Lighthouse. ;Groote Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church) Dutch Reformed Church in Galle Fort The Groote Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church) was built in 1640. However, it was remodeled between 1752 and 1755. The church is paved with grave stones from the old Dutch cemetery. There is an old organ of 1760 vintage in the church where services are held and a pulpit made of calamander wood from Malaysia is used. ;New Orient Hotel The former New Orient Hotel was originally built in 1694 for the exclusive use of the Dutch Governor and his staff, it was converted into a hotel in 1865, the New Orient Hotel, which catered to the European passengers traveling between Europe and Galle Port in the 19th century and in 2005 was modernised into a franchise of the Aman Resorts, named the Amangalla. ;Street names A street in Galle Fort area Most of the street names are a legacy from the colonial period, including Pedlar Street or ‚ÄòMoorse Kramerstraat‚Äô, the Moorish pedlar (or peddler) street, named after the Muslim moors who were retailers along with chettis; Lighthouse Street or ‚ÄòZeeburgstraat‚Äô or ‚ÄòMiddelpuntstraat‚Äô named after the lighthouse which was destroyed in a fire in 1936; Hospital Street, the location of the Dutch Hospital, the house of the Surgeon and the Medical Garden; Leyn Baan Street or ‚ÄòLeyenbahnstraat‚Äô, the Old Rope-Walk Street, where coir rope was made; Church Street, named after a church which was demolished in the 17th century and also the location of the Dutch Reformed Church and All Saints Church; Parawa Street, named after the Parawa migrants from South India who were fishermen and traders; and Chando Street named after the toddy tappers and Dutch Burghers who owned coconut gardens and small ark distilleries. ;Breadfruit Tree The breadfruit (Artucarpus incisisus) tree was introduced in Galle first by the Dutch; reputedly the oldest breadfruit tree in Sri Lanka can be found at Akersloot Bastion in Galle Fort. It is believed that the Dutch introduced breadfruit which is of ‚Äòheaty‚Äô nature hoping that would either kill them or make them sick. However, the Sri Lankans found a neutralizer to this in the coconut tree. They mixed breadfruit with coconut and evolved a delicacy, which became popular, as it was found tasty and nourishing. This tree is now grown across Sri Lanka. The fort area is occupied by mostly artists, writers, photographers, designers and poets of foreign origin and is now a mixed bag of boutiques, hotels and restaurants. Renovations All Saints' Church in Galle Fort Following the disaster caused by the Tsunami of 2004 when many buildings were damaged, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs launched a project for renovation and reconstruction, but paying attention to the former architecture to retain a historical feel. The Galle Fort has both Portuguese and Dutch era buildings, reflecting the bygone era of the colonial domination of the city. These buildings needed attention as many changes had taken place over the centuries. The Government of Sri Lanka, through its Galle Heritage Foundation under the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and National Heritage has taken the initiative of restoring some of the heritage buildings to their old glory. The restoration work has been financially supported by the Government of the Netherlands. The renovation work conforms to guidelines set by the Archeological Department of Sri Lanka. Technical guidance was provided by the Architectural Wing of the University of Moratuwa. Very many of the old town houses have been bought up by expatriates and rich Sri Lankans and Indians and renovated as holiday homes. The National Maritime Museum in Galle Fort area, near the Old gate, was established in 1997 as an exclusive Maritime Archaeology Centre with active involvement of the Government of the Netherlands in the project in view of the findings that the Galle Harbour consisted of over 21 historical shipwreck sites and associated artifacts.

Meade.http://www.gdg.org/Research/Authored%20Items/BCRReports/1911.html Cope is also noted for commemorative era battlefield administration and designs, including the layout of the 1913 Gettysburg reunion. Cope had enlisted as a Private of Company A, (First Pennsylvania Reserves), temporarily detached to Battery C, 5th U.S. Artillery, and mustered out as a V Corps aide-de-camp of Maj Gen Gouverneur K. Warren. On July 17, 1893, Cope was appointed the Topographical Engineer of the Gettysburg National Park Commission (established for \\"ascertaining the extent of... the trolley\\") and oversaw the 1893-5 battlefield survey with benchmark at the Gettysburg center square. By 1904, Cope was the first park superintendent, and, after the commission became defunct in March 1922 when the last commissioner died, became the battlefield head through the remainder of the commemorative era of the Gettysburg National Military Park. Cope's designs include structures (e.g., the original park \\"gateway\\"), markers (1908 GNMP bronze tablet/granite monolith), (NPS webpage, MN508) buildings (the 1903 Roller and Storage Building), roads (Cross, Brooke, and De Trobriand avenues), and the observation tower at Gettysburg and Valley Forge. He oversaw the development of post-war maps drawn by GNPC cartographer Schuyler A. Hammond, as well as a wooden relief map of the battlefield by J. C. Wierman for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition (on display at the Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center).

Her ex-boyfriend, Timothy \\"Tracey\\" Humphrey, and his wife Ashley Laney Humphrey, were convicted of her murder. Perpetrators Timothy Alvin \\"Tracey\\" Humphrey (born Nov. 15, 1966) was Sandee Rozzo's coworker at the time of her murder. They had previously been in a brief, but volatile relationship. He had committed an assault on Ms. Rozzo and criminal proceedings were in progress. The two had originally met at an Ybor City, Florida nightclub in November 2001 where Tracey worked as a doorman and Sandee was a bartender. Tracey had a long previous criminal record of convictions for motor vehicle theft, kidnapping and aggravated assault. The following February, Tracey was arrested for felony battery after allegedly beating and sexually assaulting Sandee. Tracey was due to go to trial on that charge on August 4, 2003, one month after Sandee's murder. Ashley Christine Humphrey (n√©e Laney; born Oct. 13, 1982) was working at Planet Smoothie in Brandon, Florida when she met Tracey Humphrey at a local gym in 2002. Ashley and Tracey married on July 4, 2003, one day before Sandee's murder. Investigation On July 5, 2003, Sandee Rozzo was shot to death in the garage of her Pinellas Park, Florida townhouse after returning home from her shift at the Green Iguana, a local bar. Sandee's coworker Tracey Humphrey became the prime suspect. Tracey had an alibi however, claiming that he had ordered a pizza to his Brandon, Florida apartment at the time of the crime. This was verified by an acquaintance, Tobe White. Further investigation however, revealed that his wife of one day, Ashley Humphrey, was not at home during the crime, as cell phone records indicated that Ashley was actually in Pinellas Park, Florida when Sandee was killed. Ashley Humphrey was arrested for the first-degree murder of Sandra Rozzo and her husband Tracey was charged with a federal firearms possession. But while she was in custody, Ashley Humphrey decided to cooperate with authorities. She had admitted that she shot Sandra Rozzo to death, but claimed it was at the behest of her husband. In her statement, she told vivid details about the plot to murder Sandee. In addition, Ashley also gave up details to another failed murder attempt against Sandee. In a plea bargain, Ashley was allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testimony against her husband. This gave prosecutors enough evidence to charge Tracey Humphrey with first-degree murder. Trial Tracey Humphrey's murder trial began in February 2006. As part of her plea deal, Ashley testified against her husband. Under oath, she testified how she waited hours for Sandee to get off work at the Green Iguana, and then followed her back to her Pinellas Park home, where she fired eight shots into Sandra Rozzo. Tracey Humphrey testified in his own defense, stating that the killing was Ashley's idea. The jury did not find him convincing. He was convicted of first-degree murder on February 25, 2006. Even though he faced the death penalty, jurors opted for life without parole, believing that it would be a harsher punishment than death in this case. Tracey Humphrey is serving his sentence at South Bay Correctional Facility in South Bay, Florida, Inmate Number: 930490. Post-conviction, he was sentenced to an additional 15 years for a pre-trial escape attempt in April 2004. On March 10, 2006, Ashley Humphrey was sentenced to 25 years for murder. She is currently incarcerated at the Gadsden Correctional Facility in Quincy, Florida, Inmate Number: 154362. She is scheduled to be released from prison on December 13, 2028; she will be 46 years old.

He was born in Islington and lived in Outram Road, Croydon, later residing in Caterham, and is reported to have worked as a chief cashier at branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland in the City of London. Lovett spent his spare time collecting, writing, and lecturing on folk-lore, usually focused on objects he had collected on his walks around London, Sussex and Surrey. Lovett was married and had at least two children. His oldest son served in the First World War. After his retirement in 1912, he dedicated himself full time to this endeavor, and to sharing his love of alpine plants. An early work, self- published, is \\"How to Make A Rock Garden and Grow Alpine Plants\\", not dated, but presumably around 1900. The two interests overlapped when Lovett was able to exchange small alpine specimens, grown in seashells, for amulets and charms from the people he met in London. He also reports having made collections in Belgium and Holland. Lovett's exhibitions in England and Wales were reviewed in the national press, some becoming permanent exhibits, and donated many objects to the Pitt Rivers Museum between 1896 and 1911. He lectured at many schools, colleges, special interest groups and societies, and reached a wide public through regular articles in local papers, describing contemporary superstitions and beliefs. An article in the Museum's Journal in 1906 set out Lovett's vision for a folk museum of Britain, and he continued to collect and campaign with this aim in mind, until the early 1920s. In 1914, Edward Lovett displayed over 500 dolls at the National Museum of Wales, with the intention of entertaining children and presenting to adults a \\"scientific history of the doll, from the standpoints of ethnography and folklore\\". Lovett's interest in dolls as idols, or miniature representations, led him to the theory that the dolls in coffins found on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh in the 1830s were substitution burials for sailors lost at sea. This theory has not been supported by recent scholarship. Over his long career collecting folklore, Lovett corresponded with many museum curators and collectors, including Henry Wellcome. The exhibition 'Folklore of London', curated by Lovett, was held at the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum in 1916. During the late 1880s he served as President of the Croydon Microscopical and Natural History Club. After joining the Folklore Society in 1900, he presented it with talks and published papers in its Journal. Lovett did not venture into theorising on folklore, confining his research to the collection of talismans and other objects with superstitious claims. A major work, Magic in Modern London, was published in 1925. Edward Lovett's donations can be found in many museums, including the Cuming Museum in Southwark, the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford, the V&A; Museum of Childhood, and the Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh (on long term loan from the National Museum of Wales). An exhibition Charmed Life: The solace of objects held at the Wellcome Collection from 6 October 2011 to 26 February 2012, displayed many of Lovett's amulets alongside contemporary films and medals by artist and curator Felicity Powell.

It has a passing resemblance to the Bren light machine gun.http://www.historicalfirearms.info/post/150834783472/north-korean- type-73-light-machine-gun History The Type 73 is based on a 1960s-era Soviet design, most likely the PK machine gun (PKM), although the date of its first production in North Korea is currently unknown. The weapon was reportedly seen in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in 2002, when a United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission team told media outlets that North Korean soldiers had set up numerous Type 73s in positions 100 to 400 meters north of the demarcation line. The weapons were reportedly removed at the end of each day. Due to the North Korean government's policy of secrecy, information on the weapon is hard to obtain. One example has been acquired by South Korea. North Korean officials were apparently not satisfied with the weapon, and by 1982 they had developed the Type 82 machine gun, which was more directly copied from the PKM's design. This seemed to replace the Type 73 in front-line service, as it was seen in use less since the early-1980s, though it was possibly moved to reserve or militia service.These Funky North Korean Guns Are Turning Up Everywhere - Warisboring.com, 1 December 2016 Many were supplied to Iran during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, and some of these have in turn been supplied to Iranian-backed groups engaged in fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the- north-korean-type-73-machine-gun-everywhere-20902 Since mid-2015, North Korean or Iranian-built copies of belt-fed Type 73s have been seen in use by Iranian- supported militias like the Popular Mobilization Forces, as well as other factions including the Christian Babylon Brigades that acquired the weapons through their alliance against the 'ISIS' organization. By early 2016, they were being used in Syria and by Houthi rebels in Yemen. Design The design is heavily based on the 1960s-era Soviet PK machine gun. However, the Type 73 does have certain indigenous modifications, including removable muzzle sleeves and a dual magazine/belt feed system, patterned after the Czechoslovak Vz.52 LMG, allowing the user to fire the weapon from indigenous box magazines or ammunition belts that can used with the PKM.https://modernfirearms.net/en/machineguns/north-korea- machineguns/type-73-eng/ One unusual feature is a special barrel attachment to enable the gun to fire rifle grenades. The weapon's intended combat role is thought to be as a squad automatic weapon. However, it uses a 7.62√ó54mmR cartridge, not the 7.62√ó39mm round used by the Type 58 assault rifle, North Korea's standard infantry rifle. This is unusual as most armies' squad automatic weapons use the same ammunition as rifles, so all members of a unit may share ammunition and only one type needs to be supplied. A larger cartridge is a characteristic of a general-purpose machine gun, although such weapons typically are belt fed and do not use a box magazine.

United States, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 147 (1872), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled, \\"A alien, whilst domiciled in the country, owes a local and temporary allegiance, which continues during the period of his residence.\\". The case has been cited in articles discussing the \\"culture defense\\" in criminal law.See Nicole A. King, \\"The Role of Culture in Psychology: A Look at Mental Illness and the 'Cultural Defense'\\", 7 Tulsa J Comp & Int'l L 199, 218 [1999]. Statement of the case Prior to the American Civil War, the claimants were subjects of the Queen of Great Britain but had been residents in the United States prior and during the war.Carlisle v. United States, 83 U.S. at 149. In December 1861, the claimants began to manufacture saltpeter, an ingredient of gunpowder, in Santa Cave, a cave 7 miles (11.25 km) southwest of Scottsboro, Alabama. During the war, the saltpeter was sold to the Confederate States military. In 1864, the Union Army in a campaign through Alabama, seized 65 bales of cotton that were valued at $43,232 and stored on the claimant's plantation. On December 25, 1868, after the Confederate government surrenderred, US President Andrew Johnson issued Proclamation 179, which unconditionally and without reservation pardoned and provided amnesty to all those who had supported the Confederate government. After the pardon, the claimants attempted to recover from the US government the proceeds of the 65 bales of cotton.Carlisle v. United States, 83 U.S. at 148. Court opinion When the claimants presented their claim after the pardons, the United States Court of Claims denied the request proclaiming that the United States government had the right to confiscate the bales of cotton because the claimants gave aid and comfort to the rebellion, and for that reason were not entitled to recover the proceeds of the cotton seized. However, in a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court reversed and held that: * British subjects, if otherwise entitled, may prosecute claims against the United States in the Court of Claims. * the claimants were allowed to make a claim and recover the proceeds because the pardon guaranteed that no offense connected with the rebellion could be imputed to the claimants. * \\"[a]n alien, whilst domiciled in the country, owes a local and temporary allegiance, which continues during the period of his residence.\\"Carlisle v.

The Atlantic Hotel was built around 1810 by Thomas Moroney, a member of the family of local landlords. For quite a while it boasted the title \\"Biggest Hotel on the British Isles\\". History In ca, 1845, Thomas Moroney extended the hotel to sixty rooms with luxurious hot and cold baths and spacious halls. The quietness and luxury made it a popular refuge for Irish and English gentry. After a nine-hole golf course was established at Spanish Point, they soon started a collaboration. Guests of the hotel could play for free, others had to pay a green fee of 2 shillings 6 pence.  Auxiliary workhouse  In 1838, the British Government issued the Irish Poor Laws to take care of the poor people and, in emergencies, to take control over destitute people. After the outbreak of the potato blight (Phytophthora infestans) and the failure of the potato crops, the system almost cracked under the pressure. Spanish Point fell under the Poor Law Union of Ennistymon. The Poor Law Union had set up a workhouse between Ennistymon and Lahinch. When the real trouble broke out due to the famine, the workhouse was soon overwhelmed. The Poor Law Union leased several other big buildings to serve as auxiliary workhouses. The Atlantic Hotel was one of them, and from September 1848 it housed 500 women and children.From a letter of Harriet Martineau, dated 22 September 1852, published in Harrington, John (ed.), The English Traveller in Ireland, Dublin, Wolfhound Press, 1991. \\\\- In 1893, the hotel was owned by Mrs. E.L. Moroney. Leon XIII The hotel also played a part in the story of the 1907 rescue of the French three- masted ship Leon XIII. During a very severe storm the vessel ran on a reef near Quilty. Despite the extreme danger of storm and heavy sea, the fishermen from Quilty manned their currachs and came to the rescue. Over three days they managed to save most of the crew members, except the captain. With a broken leg he could not be moved. He was rescued later, after the storm, by a naval vessel. The French Government was very impressed. At an event in the Atlantic Hotel, the Government presented the gallant fishermen with bronze medals. Closing down In 1930, the hotel was permanently closed. It had largely depended on the English gentry but they did not dare to travel to Spanish Point after the Irish War of Independence and the Civil War.Paddy Casey, lecture for the Kilfarboy Historical Society, 13 October 2009 \\\\- The building was still mentioned in the 1942 ITA Survey, but not as a hotel.I.T.A.

In January 2010, HPT made headlines in the poker community when the company chartered four private jets to fly two hundred poker enthusiasts to Las Vegas, Nevada for the Season VI launch of the tour. The event attracted celebrities like actor Lou Diamond Phillips and poker pro Dennis Phillips and sold out Red Rock Casino Resort Spa. In March 2010, HPT signed 2009 WSOP runner up Darvin Moon to represent the brand as Tour Ambassador. Moon became a fan favorite among HPT's tour regulars when he declined an invitation for the November Nine taping in 2010 to play an HPT stop in Iowa. A last minute replacement for an ill Scotty Nguyen, Moon bonded with HPT‚Äôs crew and players.

In 1545, the village was mentioned in the review of Kremenets castle, noting that the proprietors of the villages of Bereh and Verba retained one of Gooden. The proprietor of Verba was Zhej Kanevskiy. In 1549, the village was purchased by Mykhailo Dashkovich Elovich-Malinsky. In 1564, he won a local privilege on the foundation of the township and the right to arrange weekly auctions and a semi-annual fair. In the western part of Verba, where the roads to Kremenets, Dubno, Kozyn, and Brody intersected, he erected a town hall/house of arrivals. A township was surrounded by an earthen billow.

There are some estimates that by 2015 the worldwide gaming industry will possibly reach $70.1 billion. In statistics collected by The ESA for the year 2013, a reported 58% of Americans play video games and the average American household now owns at least one dedicated game console, PC or smartphone.2013 Essential Facts about the Computer and Video Game Industry .

The households that own these items play games most commonly on their Console or PC. 36% of U.S. gamers play on their smart phones. 43% of video game consumers believe games give them the most value for their money compared to other common forms of entertainment such as movies, or music. In 2011, the average American gamer spent an average of 13 hours per week playing video games. In 2013, almost half of Americans who were gaming more than they did in 2010 spent less time playing board games, watching TV, going to the movies, and watching movies at home. When Americans game, 62% do so with others online or in person, yet the other person is more likely to be a friend than a significant other or family member. The most common reason parents play video games with their children is as a fun family activity, or because they are asked to. 52% of parents believe video games are a positive part of their child's life, and 71% of parents with children under 18 see gaming as beneficial to mental stimulation or education. Demographics A US Marine playing Top Gun The average age of a U.S. gamer is 35, the average number of years a U.S. gamer has been playing games is 13, and only 29% of the gamer population is under 18 years old. The American gamer population is 59% male and 41% female. Of those females, women 18 and older account for a greater portion of the population than males younger than 18. The average female video game player is 44 years old, while the average male video game player is 33. Market statistics The bestselling console video game genres of 2012 were Action, Shooters, and Sports. The PC gaming market's bestselling genres were Role-playing, Strategy, and Casual. For online games the most popular genres are Puzzle/trivia, action/strategy, and casual/social games. While there are many American video game developers that have been producing games for years, Japanese games and companies have regularly been listed in the annual lists of best sellers. The U.S. computer and video game dollar sales growth of 2012 was 14.8 billion dollars, showing a drop of 1.6 billion from the year before. The Unit sales growth featured a similar drop with the report of 188 million units sold from 245.9 in 2011. U.S gaming consumers spent a total of $20.77 billion on the game industry alone and currently hard copies of video games are still dominating in sales compared to digital copies . History=1940s The beginning of video games can be traced to the year 1940, when American nuclear physicist Edward Condon designed a computer capable of playing the traditional game Nim. This device would have tens of thousands of people play it even though the computer won 90% of the time. Seven years later an American television pioneer, Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr., patented an oscilloscope displayed device that challenged players to fire a gun at a target.\\"Video Game History Timeline.\\" ICHEG.

Retrieved on November 5, 2013 The U.S. military dove into the computer age with the creation of a game titled Hutspiel. Considered a war game, Hutspiel depicted NATO and Soviet commanders waging war. The IBM 701 computer received programs like Blackjack and Checkers. A later IBM model featured a chess program that was capable of evaluating four ply ahead. The '50s also included the largely forgotten tennis game created by Willy Higinbotham that anticipated the famous game Pong. 1960s The military continued to take part in video gaming in the 1960s when, shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis The Defense Department created a war game known as STAGE (Simulation of Total Atomic Global Exchange). STAGE was created to be political propaganda that showcased how the U.S. would be victorious in a Thermonuclear war with the Soviet Union. The idea of video games that were usable on televisions was conceived by the engineer Ralph Baer and with the help of a team, Baer completed two successful TV games in this decade. The first interactive media computer game, Spacewar eventually had the future founders of Atari create an arcade game of it titled Computer Space that became the first video arcade game ever released.Kudler, Amanda. \\"Timeline: Video Games.\\",\\" \\"Infoplease\\", 2007. Retrieved on November 3, 2013. 1970s The 1970s included the birth of the video game console. The first console released was titled Magnavox Odyssey and the foundation of Atari occurred around the same time, marking the start of Pong's development. Upon Pong's completion it became the hottest selling Christmas product of 1975. The evolution of the console was incredibly rapid. A few years after their invention, consoles received microprocessors and programmable ROM cartridge based games, allowing users the ability to change games by simply switching cartridges. Important consoles released at this time were the Telstar, Fairchild Channel F., and Atari 2600. Arcade games also received advances with the game Space Invaders, which allowed high scores to be tracked and displayed. A year later the game Asteroids built on the idea and gave high scorers the ability to enter initials by their scores. 1980s The technological advances of the late '70s led to the introduction of the Intellivision in 1980, which featured better video game graphics but a higher price tag. In two years, the Commodore 64 changed the market by not only being the most powerful console of the time but also the cheapest. With the lowered prices, popularity of the video game industry continued to grow and the first video game magazine, Electronic Games, was printed. However, attempts to copycat on the success of the Atari 2600 saturated the market, and in 1983, the North American video game crash decimated the industry in the Unites States. With the American-produced games on the downswing, Nintendo successfully launched the Nintendo Entertainment System in America in 1985, revitalizing the market with the introduction of the third and fourth generation of home consoles such as the Master System, Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Atari 7800, and the TurboGrafx-16, with systems transitioning to support 3D graphics and support for optical media rather than cartridges. 1990s The early '90s saw the introduction of the Super NES, Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Tamagotchi, and Dreamcast, whose sales brought the damaged video game industry back to life. During this decade, the PlayStation was considered the most popular console when its 20 millionth unit sold. In 1993, the video game industries' first debate began and its focus was on violence found in video games. This debate fueled Senator Joseph Lieberman's desire to ban all violent games and from this investigation the Entertainment Software Rating Board was created in 1994; giving all games a printed suggested age rating on their packaging. 2000s The 2000s brought Sony even more popularity when its PlayStation 2 had such a high American consumer demand that it actually affected the console's availability to be purchased during the first few shipments; the PlayStation 2 remains the best-selling console of all time in the United States. Microsoft and Nintendo also saw this popularity with the release of their own sixth and seventh generation of consoles. Mass availability of the Internet introduced online connectivity on consoles for multiplayer games as well as digital storefronts to sell games. Digital storefronts also enabled the growth of the indie game market, expanding from computers onto consoles over this decade. Motion control-enabled games, popularized by the Wii console, grew in popularity. 2010s Within the 2010s, a larger shift towards casual and mobile gaming on smartphones and tablets became significant, in part due to a wider demographic of video game players drawing in more female and older players. The concept of Games as a service, emerged as a trend for developers and publishers to have long-tail monetization of a game well after release. Continuing from the previous decade, a large number of independently-developed video games emerged as games on par with those from major publishers, made easier to promote and distribute through digital storefronts on personal computers, consoles, and mobile store markets. All three major console manufacturers released next generation consoles: Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch. Major developments in mixed reality games - both augmented reality and virtual reality - grew in popularity during the 2010s as the cost of required hardware dropped. Esports became a significant market in the United States after its initial popularity in Eastern Asia countries. 2020s Both Microsoft and Sony have announced successors to their eighth generation consoles for release in late 2020. Both systems are expected to support high-definition graphics, including real-time ray-tracing, and support for game streaming and cloud- based gaming. Employment=Education training Video game designers are required to have a variety of skills and innate abilities that feature a vast amount of training in computer graphics, animation and software design. On top of these skills a successful designer needs a powerful imagination and knowledge of the various consoles' operating systems. Programming and hardware essentials are a must, considering games are sophisticated computer software. To get into the field many colleges offer classes, certificates, and degrees in computer programming, computer engineering, software development, computer animation, and computer graphics. Internships or apprenticeships are important to get hands on experience. If possible an aspiring American game designer should conduct freelance work. There is even the possibility of designing a game independently, using a wide array of available software. Building an independent game can be risky yet the finished product gives employers insight on what the designer is capable of; just like a portfolio.Crosby, Tim. \\"How Becoming a Video Game Designer Works\\",\\" \\"HowStuffWorks\\", n.d.

A closer comparison to what a US Game developing job could potentially start at is the Learn Direct's report of $37,000 yearly. Game ratings and government oversight Prior to 1993, there was no standardized content rating body in the United States, but with games becoming more violence and with capabilities to show more realistic graphics, parents, politicians, and other concerned citizens called for government regulation of the industry. The 1993 congressional hearings on video games, putting the recently released Mortal Kombat and Night Trap in the spotlight, drew attention to the industry's lack of a standardized rating system. While individual publishers like Sega and Nintendo had their own methods of rating games, they were not standardized and allowed discrepancies between different console systems including sales of violent games to minors. Members of Congress threatened to pass legislation that would mandate government oversight of video games if the industry did not create its own solution. The industry responded in 1994 by the formation of the trade group the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), today known as the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), and the creation of the voluntary Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) ratings system, a system that met the governmental concerns of the time. The ESRB focused mostly on console games at its founding. Computer video game software used the Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC) through 1999, but transitioned to use ESRB in 1999 while the RSAC became more focused on rating online content from the Internet. Since 1993, several incidents of gun violence in the United States, such as the Columbine School shooting of 1999, put more blame on video games for inciting these crimes, thought there is no conclusive proof that violent video games lead to violence behavior. Under demands of parents and concerned citizens, federal and state governments have attempted to pass legislation that would enforce the ESRB rating systems for retail that would pose fines to retailers that sold mature-rated games to minors. This came to a head in the Supreme Court of the United States case Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, which concluded in 2010 that video games were considered a form of protected speech, and regulation of their sales could only be mandated if the material passed the Miller test for obscene material.Kennedy, Kyle. \\"A Look At the Renewed National Debate On Violent Video Games.\\" TheLedger.com. Ledger Media Group, July 20, 2013. Web. October 10, 2013. The ESRB remains a voluntary system for rating video games in the United States, though nearly all major retail outlets will refuse to sell unrated games and will typically avoid selling those listed as \\"AO\\" for adults only. Retailers are voluntarily bound by the age ratings, though the Federal Trade Commission, in 2013, found that the ESRB system had the best compliance of preventing sales of mature games to minors compared to the other American entertainment industries. In addition to age ratings, the ESRB rating includes content descriptors (such as \\"Nudity\\", \\"Use of Drugs\\", and \\"Blood and Gore\\") to better describe the type of questionable material that may be in the game. The ESRB not only rates games after reviewing material submitted by the publisher, but also spot-checks games after release to make sure no additional content had been added after review, applying fines and penalties to publishers that do so. Notably, the ESRB was heavily involved over the Hot Coffee mod, a user mod of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas that unlocked a sex scene that had been on the retail disc but otherwise inaccessible without the mod. Currently 85% of American parents are aware of the ESRB rating system and many are finding parental controls on video game consoles useful. In the digital storefront space, including digital-only games and downloadable content for retail games, the ESRB does not require ratings though encourages developers and publishers to utilize the self-assessment ratings tools provided by the International Age Rating Coalition to assign their game a rating which can propagate to other national and regional ratings systems, such as the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) system. Arcade games in the United States are rated separated under a \\"Parental Advisory System\\" devised by the American Amusement Machine Association, the Amusement & Music Operators Association, and the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry, along with guidelines for where more mature games should be located in arcades and other code of conduct principles for arcade operators.

As of 2011, the FPAQ produced 94% of Canadian maple syrup and 77% of the world's supply. The FPAQ plays a role in the collective marketing of maple products and in organizing sales inside and outside the province. Some consider it to be a cartel. History Beginning in 1958, the maple syrup producers of Beauce region in the south of Quebec participated in a joint plan to protect their rights as producers and to collectively market maple syrup. This effort inspired the formation of a larger agreement all across Quebec in 1966. Since 1989, all FPAQ‚Äôs producers abide by a collective agreement to market their product. Together, the producers establish policies, negotiate their selling strategy, enforce production quota, set up quality criteria and sponsor promotional activities. However, if they cannot come to an agreement the act calls for an outside opinion to arbitrate. The maple syrup producers who sell directly to consumers are exempted from this law. The FPAQ collaborates with the ACER center to conduct research and experiments on maple syrup. In 2000, the Federation became the exclusive sales agent for bulk sales and in 2004, they reformed the quota system. In 2017, the federation had to add five million taps due to the rise of foreign competition. Promotion and marketing The FPAQ is involved in many promotional activities that aim to spread the maple syrup market around the world. The FPAQ hosts culinary competitions within Quebec but also in Japan and the United States. The FPAQ has held showcases in Hiroshima and free maple syrup tastings as promotional activities. Chefs and professionals from Hiroshima participated in a culinary competition that included an original recipe using maple syrup in 2010. The FPAQ aims to spread consumer awareness of their product in Japan in order to increase their consumption and Quebec‚Äôs exportation. The FPAQ has engaged in an agreement with Tokyo DisneySea, a Disney theme park, to promote maple syrup and encourage the Japanese to purchase and consume it. Market strategies in Quebec are common as well; however they aim to further educate and to keep the maple syrup legacy alive in the future generations. Culinary competitions involving traditional family recipes aspire to do so. Teachers are encouraged to educate their students on maple trees and the production of maple syrup with the help of a newly published maple syrup encyclopedia. Strategic reserve The FPAQ maintains a strategic reserve of maple syrup, officially known as the International Strategic Reserve (ISR) and also referred to as the Global Strategic Maple Syrup Reserve. The reserve is operated as a government- sanctioned cartel to control global maple syrup prices and supply, and has been called \\"the OPEC of the maple syrup world\\" by The Economist. A barrel is worth about $1,200 or $2.88 per pound which is 10-18 times the value of U.S. crude oil. The reserve is located in warehouses in a number of rural Quebec towns. The first two facilities were in Saint-Antoine-de-Tilly (which holds 6,300 tonnes), and Plessisville (which holds 1,400 tonnes). In 2011, a year which saw huge excesses of maple syrup production, FPAQ expanded the ISR to a third warehouse in Saint-Louis-de-Blandford, which holds 4,500 tonnes of syrup. In August 2012, thieves were reported to have stolen roughly 1,000 tonnes of syrup worth CA$30 million from the new ISR facility in Saint-Louis- de-Blandford. This event is known informally as the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist. The amount stolen was about a quarter of the facility's reserve. Slightly over a month later, police seized maple syrup stocks from a Kedgwick, New Brunswick, exporter on suspicion that it had been purchased from a Quebec supplier connected to the ISR theft. Over the next three months, police had further success in locating portions of the stolen syrup, but were still unsure of the final disposition of about one third of it. Much of it had apparently been sold to buyers who were unaware of its origins and who were led to believe it had been produced in neighbouring New Brunswick. On 18 December, police arrested three men known to have access to the warehouse from which the syrup was stolen. Fifteen more people were arrested on 20 December, with police still looking for another seven. The theft and its backstory are featured in the Netflix documentary series Dirty Money, Season 1, Episode 5. On April 28, 2017, accused ringleader Richard Valli√®res, convicted in November 2016, was sentenced to eight years in prison and a $9.4 million fine. He can choose another six years of prison over paying the fine, and is appealing the conviction. The missing syrup was valued at 3,000 tonnes and $18.7 million. On January, 25, 2018, maple syrup producers Nathalie Bombardier and Daniel Gaudreau had their supply seized by the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec, due to their refusal to sell their surplus production through the Federation. Instead Bombardier and Gaudreau prefer to sell their supply directly to businesses.

The Malaysian government has ensured these factors through the establishment of Ministry of National Unity and Social Development in 1997 (formerly known in 1993 as Women's Affairs Secretariat or HAWA). This was followed by the formation of the Women's Affairs Ministry in 2001 to recognise the roles and contributions of Malaysian women. 47% of Malaysian women are in the workforce.  Women's rights  After the UN's Universal Periodic Review of Malaysia in 2009, the government ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 2010, although with certain reservations. The status of women in the country is complex, and partly dependent on their religion and on where they reside in the states and federal territories of Malaysia, factors which affect certain legal issues. The issue of women's rights in the country is subject to ideological disagreements between conservative and liberal interpretations of Islam, and between more secular forces.  Sharia courts  Sharia allows men to have multiple wives, as he would be solely responsible to meet the needs of the women married and in inheritance cases, the male would inherit more as he would need to spend this favourably on his wives and children, providing for them at his utmost. Non-Muslim women, and Muslim women in four states, enjoy equal parental rights. There may be employment discrimination against women, but not due to any Islamic ruling. In the state of Kedah, women performers can only perform in front of female audiences.  Sexual harassment  A designated commuter section for women only in Kuala Lumpur. Sexual harassment is common, and since 2010 trains on the Malaysian Railway have included pink-coloured women-only cars as a means of cutting down on it. There are also women-only buses in Kuala Lumpur since 2010. In 2011, the government launched a women-only taxi service in the greater Kuala Lumpur area. The taxis have women drivers, and operate on an on- call basis.  Female genital mutilation  Female genital mutilation (FGM) is practised in Malaysia, with an estimated of more than 90% of women from Muslim families having undergone the practice. Reasons cited for the performance of FGM include religious obligation, hygiene, cultural practices, and the belief that it prevents pre-marital sex. However, the form of FGM practised in the country is not as severe as in other parts of the world, such as Northeast Africa, and is reported to only consist of a minor cut. Yet, the extent of the practice is not fully known and is mainly based on anecdotal reports and anthropological studies, as neither reports by national groups nor documented evidence have been found . FGM is widely viewed as a religious obligation; in 2009, the Fatwa Committee of Malaysia's National Council of Islamic Religious Affairs ruled that FGM was obligatory for Muslims, but that harmful forms of it must be avoided.  Domestic violence  Women in Malaysia have certain protections from domestic violence (DV), including the Domestic Violence Act 1994. Under the Penal Code, women may charge their husbands for acts of abuse such as physical violence or threats‚Äîthe only criminal offence with a marital exemption is Rape (Art 375). Marital rape (non-consensual sexual intercourse in marriage) is not, in and of itself, illegal, but a man who \\"causes hurt or fear of death or hurt to his wife or any other person in order to have sexual intercourse with his wife\\" commits a crime under Art 375A of the Penal Code. According to one study, in Malaysia, 39% of women above 15 years of age have been physically abused by their partners. Domestic violence is increasingly seen as a public issue: Women‚Äôs Aid Organisation (WAO) has introduced a SMS helpline for victims of DV. There is controversy as to what acts constitute DV, either under the Domestic Violence Act 1994 or under the Penal Code. This rests on the interpretation of legal terms, on how DV relates to marriage laws which require the wife to obey her husband's lawful demands (see below), and on how the Domestic Violence Act 1994 relates to the Penal Code and to Syariah Courts. The debate is on what type of coercion may a husband use to compel his wife to perform her duties. Controversially, the Section 2‚ÄîInterpretation, subsection (c), of the Domestic Violence Act 1994 makes reference to \\"compelling the victim by force or threat to engage in any conduct or act, sexual or otherwise, from which the victim has right to abstain\\". This suggests that if the act was one to which the wife is legally obligated to submit, this specific section cannot apply‚Äîmeaning that in this circumstance, the \\"force\\" or \\"threat\\" do not fall under the definition of DV under this act. However, this rests on the definition of \\"force\\" or \\"threat\\", as some acts are clearly prohibited under the previous subsections (a) and (b) of the same act‚Äî\\"willfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, the victim in fear of physical injury\\" and \\"causing physical injury to the victim by such act which is known or, ought to have been known would result in physical injury\\" are indeed prohibited. The approach to DV in Malaysia has been criticised as weak, and potentially creating problematic legal loopholes. Sex trafficking Some women and girls have been victims of sex trafficking in Malaysia. They have been forced into prostitution and marriages in Asia and other continents and are physically and psychologically abused.  Marriage and family life  Muslim girls in Malaysia. Women in Malaysia have restrictions in marriage, although some of their rights are protected. Under the Islamic Family Law, the wife's maintenance by her husband is conditioned by her obedience. Art. 59(2) states that: \\"2) Subject to Hukum Syarak and confirmation by the Court, a wife shall not be entitled to maintenance when she is nusyuz or unreasonably refuses to obey the lawful wishes or commands of her husband, that is to say, inter alia ‚Äì (a) when she withholds her association with her husband; (b) when she leaves her husband‚Äôs home against his will; or (c) when she refuses to move with him to another home or place, without any valid reason according to Hukum Syarak. However, some rights of the wife (in regard to property, court cases, and bank accounts) are protected by the Married Women Act, 1957 (Act. 450), at Art. 4 - Capacity of married women. Malaysia outlawed marital rape in 2007.MP Teresa Kok, Mixed reaction to marital rape reform, Sassy MP, September 15, 2007.AP, \\"Malaysian jailed for marital rape,\\" Sydney Morning Herald, August 6, 2009.  Education  The literacy rate is lower for females (90.7%) compared to males (95.4%)‚Äîestimates as of 2010, for population aged 15 and over. Malaysia, has, in recent years invested in the education of both sexes; and as a result, more girls are now studying at the university level.  Criticism of women's status in Malaysia  In 2006, Marina Mahathir, the daughter of Malaysia's former Prime Minister and an active campaigner for women's rights, described the status of Muslim women in Malaysia as similar to that of Black South Africans under apartheid. Marina's remarks were made in response to a new Islamic law that enables men to divorce or take up to four wives. The law also granted husbands more authority over their wives' property. Conservative groups such as the Malaysian Muslim Professionals Forum criticised her comments for insulting Sharia and undermining the prominent role of women in Malaysia compared to other Muslim and/or east Asian countries.

Origins The story of The Enemys begins in Buffalo, New York in the mid-1960s, when vocalist Cory Wells joined a band called The Vibratos after leaving the U.S. Air Force. With the encouragement of the group‚Äôs manager, Gene Jacobs, Wells headed to Los Angeles along with Vibratos guitar player Mike Lustan and drummer Dave Treiger. The trio recruited bass player Cal Titus and renamed themselves Cory Wells & The Enemys. The music scene that The Enemys entered into in Los Angeles in 1965/66 was thriving, with up-and-coming bands like The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, The Doors, Love, The Rising Sons, The Leaves, The Music Machine, and Spirit filling the many clubs that had sprung up along Sunset Strip and the Hollywood area. The Enemys landed their first gig at The Rag Doll on Coldwater Canyon and Victory Blvd, and would go on to play at all the big Hollywood clubs, including Ciro‚Äôs, The Crescendo, The Palomino Club, The London Fog, The Red Velvet, and Gazzarri's on the Strip, The Action on Melrose, Cinnamon Cinder on Ventura Blvd., and Danita‚Äôs in the Valley. Eventually The Enemys became the house band at the Whisky a Go Go for a lengthy engagement. Recordings, film and television appearances The Enemys released their first single, Sinner Man, backed with Say Goodbye To Donna on Valiant Records in 1965. They moved to MGM Records for their next 45, Glitter And Gold / Too Much Monkey Business, produced by the legendary Tom Wilson. For their third release, The Enemys teamed up with producer Danny Hutton to record a version of a song that had become a mainstay of the repertoire of nearly every band on the Strip in 1966, the Billy Roberts folk classic Hey Joe, backed with My Dues Have Been Paid. The final Enemys record was the RnB rocker Mo-Jo Woman, which the group also performed on an episode of The Beverly Hillbillies, along with the song Oh, Pretty Woman and an instrumental number. The band also played an instrumental on an episode of the TV series Burke's Law and made an appearance in the teen exploitation movie Riot on Sunset Strip performing Jolene. By 1967, The Enemys had split and Wells moved to Arizona. A year later he was back in Los Angeles where he reunited with Danny Hutton and formed Three Dog Night.

He was appointed fashion director of British fashion magazine i-D at the age of 18, a position he held for over two decades. Early life Edward Enninful was born in Ghana, and at a very young age, emigrated to Ladbroke Grove, London, along with his parents and five siblings. His mother worked as a seamstress, and inspired him with the vividly patterned colours and fabrics she used while creating clothing for her British-Ghanaian friends. At the age of 16, Enninful was spotted on a train by stylist Simon Foxton. \\"I was 16 and I had no idea who Simon Foxton was,\\" he said in an interview for Telegraph Magazine. \\"About two weeks later I was stopped again, this time by a model scout. When I told her that I'd already been approached by Simon Foxton, she told me how amazing he was and weeks later I was shooting with him at his house, along with Nick Knight, a founder-photographer of i-D.\\" Enninful described his brief career modelling as his \\"baptism into fashion\\". By the age of 17, he had been introduced to Trish and Terry Jones, founder of i-D magazine, and soon began assisting i-D fashion director Beth Summers. He finished college, earning a degree at Goldsmiths, University of London (\\"Barely, but otherwise my dad would have killed me.\\") while juggling his modelling career and assisting on shoots with Foxton and Summers. Summers left the magazine a few weeks after Enninful's 18th birthday, and Terry Jones gave Enninful the position. Career=i-D magazine and work in advertising At the age of 18, Enninful's position as fashion director at i-D made him the youngest ever fashion director for an international publication. Soon, he became known for his edgy elegance, which quickly became his trademark. Much of his inspiration came from the streets. \\"We British have to customize our clothes, we have to be more creative, informing who you are‚Äîand I am still obsessed with the streets.\\" The looks he featured in his stories helped fuel the grunge movement during the early 1990s. By the age of 22, Enninful worked for Calvin Klein on their advertising with Craig McDean and close friend, makeup artist Pat McGrath. To date, he has consulted for numerous advertising campaigns and runway shows, including Comme des Gar√ßons, Christian Dior, Dolce and Gabbana, Celine, Lanvin, Mulberry, Giorgio Armani, Valentino, Jil Sander, Calvin Klein, Fendi, Alessandro Dell'Acqua, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Missoni. For the March 2009 issue of i-D, Enninful styled \\"The Best British\\" cover story by photographer S√∏lve Sundsb√∏. The issue printed 12 separate covers, each featuring one of twelve British super models, including Jourdan Dunn, Kate Moss, Susie Bick, Naomi Campbell, Stella Tennant, Eliza Cummings, Alice Dellal, Daisy Lowe, Twiggy, Yasmin Le Bon, Lily Donaldson, and Agyness Deyn.\\"i-D Magazine March 2009 : The Best Of British\\", DesignScene, 10 February 2009. Italian Vogue In 1998, Enninful became a contributing editor to Italian Vogue. According to him, working with Vogue Italia editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani and photographer Steven Meisel propelled him to mature as a stylist. \\"I always say that I was a London stylist but when I worked with Steven, I became a proper stylist.\\" At Italian Vogue, he spearheaded the production of its \\"Black Issue\\", which featured only black models, including Naomi Campbell, Jourdan Dunn and Alek Wek. He described his intention as ending the \\"white-out that dominates the catwalks and magazines\\". The issue was so successful that Cond√© Nast had to print an extra 40,000 copies. Enninful also styled the magazine's highly publicised June 2011 cover editorial, \\"Belle Vere\\", which exclusively featured plus sized models including Tara Lynn, Candice Huffine, and Robyn Lawley.Amy Odell, \\"Franca Sozzani Hopes the Three Plus-Size Models on the Cover of Italian Vogue Make the Industry Reconsider Its Obsession With Teenagers\\", NY Mag, 6 June 2011. American Vogue In 2006, Enninful became contributing fashion editor for American Vogue. He can be seen in the documentary \\"The September Issue\\". W magazine It was announced in April 2011 that Enninful would be taking over as fashion and style-director of W, a position formerly held by Alex White. He stated in an interview to WWD, \\"Now I'm going to be focusing my editorial prowess on W,\\" ending his 10-year relationship as a freelancer with American and Italian Vogue. Under Enninful's direction, W generated considerable attention for its riskier editorial, including the March 2012 cover shot by Steven Klein featuring Kate Moss depicted as a nun,Will Self, \\"Good Kate, Bad Kate\\" , W, March 2012. as well as another cover featuring singer Nicki Minaj dolled up as an 18th-century French courtesan.James Lim, \\"Nicki Minaj Lands W Magazine‚Äôs Alternate November Cover\\", NY Mag, 14 October 2011. And for the magazine's November 2011 art issue, Enninful collaborated with Steven Meisel on a series of fake advertisements that ran throughout the magazine, including one that featured a drag queen contestant from RuPaul's Drag Race named Carmen Carrera hawking a fictitious fragrance called La Femme (\\"Isn't W Magazine the cleverest in all the land?\\" the fashion blog \\"styleite\\" wrote). While the magazine was suffering in 2010, amid a brutal recession and competition from V Magazine and Interview Magazine, W began showing signs of life after Enninful's takeover. The magazine's ad pages went up 16.7 percent by May 2012, with 453 pages compared to 388 pages for the same period the year before, according to Media Industry Newsletter‚Äîthe biggest year-over-year gain among fashion titles. Editorial Director Stefano Tonchi told The New York Times that Enninful was a big part of that success. Enninful was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to diversity in the fashion industry. British Vogue Enninful was confirmed as the new editor-in-chief of British Vogue on 10 April 2017, as the first black editor-in-chief of the magazine. Cond√© Nast International chairman and chief executive Jonathan Newhouse announced him as the successor to Alexandra Shulman, calling Enninful \\"an influential figure in the communities of fashion, Hollywood and music which shape the cultural zeitgeist\\", adding that \\"by virtue of his talent and experience, Edward is supremely prepared to assume the responsibility of British Vogue\\". It was noted that Enninful had six times as many followers on Instagram as Shulman at the time of his appointment. His influence was also recognised regularly in the annual Powerlist, seeing him ranked in the Top 10 of the most influential British people of African Descent in both 2019 & 2020. In July 2020, he attempted to gain access to Vogues London office, but was not recognised by a security guard. He stated that he was a victim of racial profiling, and this resulted in the guard who refused him entry losing his job.

It was originally cultivated by Native Americans before the arrival of Europeans Bartram, W. Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida. 1791.Sargent, C. S. Manual of the trees of North America. 2nd Ed. Vol. II. Dover Pub., Inc. New York. 934p. 1965.Little, E. L. Checklist of United States Trees. USDA Forest service. Washington, D.C. 1979. While Prunus is the classical name for European plums, angustifolia refers to its narrow leaves. Prunus angustifolia flowers and fruit Ripening Chickasaw Plum Description Chickasaw plum grows feet tall and wide in an irregular shape. It is \\"twiggy\\" in nature, and has a scaly, almost black bark. Its branches are reddish with thorn-like, small side branches. In February, March, April and May, small white flowers blossom, wide, along with red plums, up to long. The flowers have five white petals with reddish or orange anthers. The plums are cherry-like and tend to be quite tart until they fully ripen. They ripen in late summer. It requires low to medium amounts of water to grow, and dry, sandy or loose soil. It grows best in areas with regular sunlight or areas of partial shade. In sunny areas, it will be more dense and colonize thickly. In areas of partial shade, it will be thinner and less dense, and each plant will be more spread out. P. angustifolia is very difficult to distinguish from Prunus umbellata, with which it hybridizes easily. Thicket of Chickasaw Plums Distribution Prunus angustifolia is widespread across much of the eastern and central United States from Florida west as far as New Mexico and California, north to Nebraska, Illinois, and New Jersey, with a few isolated populations in northern Michigan.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map The species grows in dry and sandy soils, such as open woodlands, woodland edges, forest openings, savannahs, prairies, plains, meadows, pastures, and roadsides. It is listed by the USDA as an endangered species in the state of New Jersey. Taxonomy American plum (Prunus americana Marsh.) hybridizes naturally with P. angustifolia to produce P. √ó orthosepala Koehne.Lee, Sangtae; Wen, Jun. (2001). A phylogenetic analysis of Prunus and the Amygdaloideae (Rosaceae) using ITS sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA. American Journal of Botany. 88(1): 150-160. Uses Chickasaw plums tend to bloom early in the spring before many other plants bloom, and require very little maintenance; as a result, they are often used in ornamental horticulture. They are often found growing wild along highways, especially in the southern part of the United States. The fruit is eaten by various animals, and the foliage provides cover for nesting sites. The 1/2 inch edible fruits change from red to yellow when fully ripe. They may be eaten raw and are often made into jellies. Because of its attractive bark, small leaves and thin branches, Chickasaw plum is also sometimes used for bonsai. Ecology It is used by many species as a larval host, including the black-waved flannel moth, the blinded sphinx, the cecropia moth, the coral hairstreak, the elm sphinx, the hummingbird clearwing moth, the imperial moth, the Io moth, the polyphemus moth, the promethea silkmoth, the red-spotted purple, the small-eyed sphinx, the spring azure, the striped hairstreak, and the tiger swallowtail.The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press.

They are tiny insects, with workers measuring about 1.2 mm and queens reaching to about 1.8 mm, and live in very small colonies of only a few hundred individuals at a time (as compared to the 60,000 to 20,000,000 individuals of legionary ant colonies.) Its sexual development follows a seasonal cycle that affects the colony's migration and feeding habits, and vice versa. L. japonica exhibits specialized predation, with prey consisting mainly of geophilomorph centipedes, a less reliable food source that also contributes to their high rate of nest migration. Like ants of genera Amblyopone and Proceratium, the genus Leptanilla engages in larval hemolymph feeding (LHF), with the queen using no other form of sustenance. LHF is an advantageous alternative to the more costly cannibalism. Unlike any other ant, however, members of Leptanilla, including L. japonica, have evolved a specialized organ dubbed the ‚Äúlarval hemolymph tap‚Äù that reduces the damage LHF inflicts on the larvae. LHF has become this species' main form of nutrition.  Taxonomy  The genus Leptanilla belongs to the subfamily Leptanillinae along with about 30 other known species. Leptanillines were once classified as a tribe of Dorylinae, the subfamily of Old World driver ants. They were raised to subfamily status upon further examination of their unusual larval morphology  Morphology and description  L. japonica is subterranean, migratory, and a very small ant, measuring only 1.2 mm for workers and 1.8 mm for queens. Workers are yellow and blind. The larva's stenocephalic head with the elaborate prothoracic structure below the mandibles and other mouthparts. Larvae are smaller, closer to 0.8 mm, with specialized features used in feeding and nest migration. They have relatively large bodies covered in minute hairs and their hairless heads are quite small, a characteristic called stenocephaly; this feature evolved to help large groups of larvae feed on one centipede body at once Their mandibles also developed to help them feed; they are directed outwards and armed with sharp teeth, enabling the larvae to eat without assistance from the workers. Another unusual structure lies on the ventral or bottom side of the first segment of the larvae's thorax, also called their prothorax; workers grab on to this with their lower mouthparts, which are distinct from their mandibles, when transporting larvae during migration. The ‚Äúlarval hemolymph tap‚Äù is the Leptanilla larvae's most unusual feature and was formerly thought to be a spiracle. Their spiracles are simply very, very small. The ‚Äútap‚Äù consists of a duct that connects to their hemolymph, with an opening surrounded by a small hairless area on the fourth abdominal segment. This specialized organ greatly facilitates LHF. Colonies are very small, with average worker populations numbering only 100-200 individuals. Research suggests that, based on the ant's cyclical development and reproduction, worker populations are renewed annually, with most workers living for about one year. When migrating either to prey or a new nest site, workers attach their lower mouthparts to the larvae's prothoracic structure and carry them along their body, ventral side to ventral side, with the larva's head pointing forwards. When agitated, however, workers will also simply grab the larva behind the head with their mandibles and drag them. Queens are larger than workers; they have eyes, but no wings. The posterior or last segment of their abdomen, also called their gaster, is very large in proportion to the rest of their bodies. Males measure roughly 1.3 mm in size, only a little bigger than the workers, and are unusual in having hairy eyes. They are the only caste with wings, albeit rather small wings. One wing actually consists of two parts: the forewing is larger and has veins; the hindwing is much smaller with no veins. Their mandibles are also different from the females‚Äô; whereas the workers and queens mandibles are prominent and mobile, the males‚Äô mandibles are little more than small lobes held close to their head. Male ants of this species have been difficult to find in conjunction with workers and queens, and thus their behavior has not been observed and recorded as extensively as that of the females.  Development and reproduction  L. japonica develops and reproduces in synchronous, yearly cycles of a larval-growing stage and an egg-laying stage. The active egg-laying stage starts in late spring and ends in late fall. In a very short period in midsummer, the queen lays a batch of roughly 200 eggs while last year's hatch of larvae pupate, or undergo metamorphosis to change from larvae to adults; hatching and adult emergence also occur around the same time. The new larvae develop quickly and hibernate during the winter. Late spring comes and the cycle repeats. The queen's gaster remains contracted for all of the larval-developing stage, reaching no greater than 0.35 mm in diameter. At the onset of spring, she enters physogastry, a phase in which her gaster greatly expands, while the first few larvae show signs of pupation. Her gaster swells with egg-filled ovarioles and grows up to 1.1 mm in diameter. In spite of their size, queens at this stage are very mobile, in contrast to their near motionlessness during the larval-growing stage. Very soon after physogastry begins, the queen starts laying eggs in a continuous string, with the occasional help of nearby workers. They grab the eggs with their mandibles and gently pull them away from her cloaca, the orifice of her reproductive tract. This is only one of many of the workers‚Äô jobs during the egg-laying stage. During this time, workers cease foraging and migrating to focus on caring for the nest. Workers help larvae get rid of their digestive tracts, a process necessary for pupation, and occasionally eat their feces. They also help them shed their larval skin.  Migration and food cultivation  L. japonica navigate using a trail system marked with a gland secretion from their sternal side, though travel is disorganized and mostly individual. While roughly half of the workers hunts, the other half engages in grooming, larval care, or stands as guards at the edges of the brood pile. The guard ants almost always assume the same position: they face the outside with their anterior end lifted, their forelegs raised, and their mandibles open. Should anything come close, they quickly charge it. The other half of the workers is occupied with finding, attacking, and paralyzing the species main, if not only, prey, geophilomorph centipedes. Sufficient paralysis can be accomplished with a small number of ants within 10‚Äì15 minutes. Most of the time, the workers pull the centipede to the brood pile, with the colony occasionally moving towards the prey as well to meet somewhere in the middle. A few times, however, researchers observed the colony move entirely to the prey site without moving the centipede. During such migrations, workers attached to the larvae's prothoracic structures to carry them to the paralyzed prey. As previously described, the larvae's body and mandible shape make for easy feeding. They rip away the outer tissue, and the workers eat from the holes the larvae make. Predation is active during the larval-growing stage, but stops during the egg-laying stage along with migration. The main source of nutrition during this stage is the larvae themselves.  Larval hemolymph feeding  The queen of L. japonica eats only via larval hemolymph feeding. During the egg-laying stage and physogastry, her rate of LHF doubles. She moves around grabbing all of the larvae in her path, with workers carrying additional larvae to her. The physicality of the queen's LHF follows. She strokes a mature larva with her antennae, then holds the posterior end with all six legs, lying on her side and placing her lower mouthparts on the body. She turns the body around, feeling with her mandibles until she finds the ‚Äúlarval hemolymph tap‚Äù in the fourth abdominal segment. The lack of lapping movements of the queen's mouthparts and the lack of larval muscles along the duct organ suggest that the hemolymph is ingested via the queen's effort. Hemolymph flow would cease by itself when the queen released the larva or by the hemolymph congealing at the opening. LHF evolved as a less costly form of last-resort nutrition than cannibalism. Many ant species engage in trophic egg consumption in which the workers have sterile eggs that the ants can feed on. Leptanilla workers, however, do not have ovarioles and thus do not have that option. Because it has never been observed, mouth-to-mouth feeding, or oral trophallaxis, is thought to be absent from this genus. LHF is seen in Amblyopone and Proceratium, but those genera have much larger populations, ranging from 60,000 to 20,000,000 workers per colony. With so many individuals at the queen's disposal, severely damaging the larvae she feeds on would have a negligible negative impact on her reproductive fitness. The queens of Leptanilla, on the other hand, cannot afford such a risk with colonies of only 100-200 individuals; an organ reducing the damage of LHF would be highly selected for in such a species. It also allows for the synchronization and cyclical nature of brood development. The absence of trophic eggs, the cost of cannibalism, the specialized predation of sporadic prey, the cyclical and synchronous colony maturation, and the reduced cost of LHF via the ‚Äúlarval hemolymph tap‚Äù have all allowed for LHF to become one of this genus‚Äô main feeding habits.

Politics In 1970, the political and social atmosphere of Oman changed with the advent of a new ruler, Sultan Qaboos bin Said, son of the conservative and rigid Said bin Taimur. After decades of stagnant to non-existent growth, Qaboos overthrew his father in a palace coup and immediately began numerous social programs, commissioning hospitals, clinics, schools, etc. Many Omanis who had been living abroad to get a proper education returned to participate in the construction of a new nation. The abroadees also brought with them the liberal and open attitude of their host countries, including the idea of equal gender relations.Chatty, Dawn. \\"Women Working in Oman: Individual Choice and Cultural Constraints.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 32.2 (2000): 241-54 Sultan Qaboos introduced many reforms funded mostly by the oil revenue, targeting development and social services. He also appointed the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Council), a body of representatives elected by the people that review legislation. This act gave the people more control in their government which had been previously in complete control of the royal family and his appointed cabinet. In the September 2000 elections, 83 candidates were elected for seats in the Majlis al-Shura, including two women. In 1996, the Sultan issued \\"The Basic Law of the Sultanate of Oman\\" to serve as a form of written constitution. This document gives the Omani people their basic civil liberties as well as guaranteeing equality and protection under the law. In 2002, universal suffrage was granted to all Omanis over the age of 21.\\"Oman - Leadership.\\" Encyclopedia of the Nations.

In the past the College of Engineering at Sultan Qaboos University banned the entrance of female students, claiming that the \\"outdoor setting\\" of engineering field work was not gender appropriate.

The number of professional women decreased and women were forced into more traditional roles as \\"nurturers and caregivers.\\" The Omani Women's Association, the first women's government-recognized group in Oman, was stripped of the majority of its independence and was passed to the male-led Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor. In 1984, it was replaced with a Directorate General of Women and Child Affairs with a sub-unit for women's associations. The main goal of this unit was to set up classes for women to learn basic household skills and day-care centers for the handicapped and disabled.Chatty, Dawn. \\"Women Working in Oman: Individual Choice and Cultural Constraints.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 32.2 (2000): 241-54 Despite the slight setbacks, Oman is still considered to be one of the leading Gulf countries in terms of gender equality and continue to make positive strides. In 1997, the Omanisation Policy was implemented, committing to the promise of gradually replacing foreign labor dependence with Omani workers, giving women more of a chance to participate in the work force and making jobs more accessible to all Omanis.Aslam, Neelufer, and Srilekha Goveas. \\"A Role and Contributions of Women in the Sultanate of Oman.\\" International Journal of Business and Management 6.3 (2011): 232-39 Women now make up 30% of the workforce and even serve in ministerial positions.

Oman: Reform, Security, and U.S. Policy. Rep. no. RS21534. Vol. 7-5700. Washington D.C.: Congressional Research Service, 2011. The most common role for the Omani woman is still the role of housewife. The housewife is essential to the upkeep of the family and will take command of all agricultural production while her husband is away for months at a time. These women work hard to support a family and tend to many matters traditionally seen by the man.Chatty, Dawn. \\"Women Working in Oman: Individual Choice and Cultural Constraints.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 32.2 (2000): 241-54 Women are not allowed to cover their face (niqab) in professional institutes, number of Omani and expats women not able to show their participation in public field, even it is not allow women to cover their face while driving Religion Omani society and legislation as a whole is based on the Islamic Sharia law which provides men and women with different rights and responsibilities. The country's progressive interpretation of Sharia law means that women are allowed to participate in politics, society and workforce to the fullest extent possible, but at the same time not allowing them to ignore their responsibilities they have towards their families. The country has made a concerted effort to improve the rights of women in accordance with the Sharia, at the same time keeping their responsibilities in mind as well. Attire The rules of modesty in Islamic culture require a woman to be modestly covered at all times, especially when traveling farther from the home. At home, the Omani woman wears a long dress to her knees along with ankle-length pants and a leeso, or scarf, covering her hair and neck. Multitudes of lively colored Jalabiyyas are also worn at home. Once outside the home, dress is varied according to regional tastes. For some of a more conservative religious background, the burqa is expected to be worn to cover her face in the presence of other males, along with the wiqaya, or head scarf, and the abaya, an all- enveloping cloak revealing only her hands and feet.Wikan, Unni. Behind the Veil in Arabia: Women in Oman. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1982. Many women from varying regions of the Sultanate wear the scarf to cover only their hair. The cotton burqa is symbolic of the expectations of the ideal woman and act as a mark of respect to represent her modesty and honor as well as her status. The burqa, first worn by a young girl after her seven-day honeymoon, is on whenever she is in the presence of strangers or outside the home, covering most of her face from view. The highest and lowest classes of Omanis do not wear the burqa‚Äîthe highest being the children and relatives of the Sultan and the lowest being the poorest women in the town. This makes the burqa a symbol of rank as well. Some burqa differ in regions and designs as well, varying in size, shape and color. The Quran, however, makes no references specific to the modern day burqa.Wikan, Unni. Behind the Veil in Arabia: Women in Oman. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1982. The abaya is the conservative dress of choice, favored by women of most social classes and regions. The multitudes of designs and decadent embellishments on the modern day abaya has allowed it to become a versatile clothing that can be made either plain or a fashion statement, in Oman and in other neighboring Islamic countries. Family Women have always been seen as a wife and mother first and foremost. A good marriage and the bearing of children determine their social status and as soon as a woman is wed, most of her decisions are made by her husband.Chatty, Dawn. \\"Women Working in Oman: Individual Choice and Cultural Constraints.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 32.2 (2000): 241-54 Marriage is a defining moment in the life of an Omani woman and marks her transformation from girl to woman. Though Sultan Qaboos extended both males and females the legal right to choose their spouse in 1971, tradition holds that the girl's father is responsible for setting up a proper match and securing his daughter's happiness. Most girls get married around the time they reach puberty, for the timely arrival of sexual desire is supposed to coincide with marriage. In this way, every unwed Omani girl is expected to be a virgin.Wikan, Unni. Behind the Veil in Arabia: Women in Oman. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1982. In combination with the improvements in other areas of female life, the importance of sexual health and health education of women has come to the forefront recently. Even in 2004, 15% of adolescent girls aged 15‚Äì20 were married, a much higher statistic than other countries and resulting in a very young and uneducated population of young mothers. In 1994, the government implemented a birth spacing program and encouraged the use of contraceptives among married couples by providing them for free in most health centers.Riyami, Asya, Mustafa Afifi, and Ruth Mabry. \\"Women's Autonomy, Education and Employment in Oman and Their Influence on Contraceptive Use.\\" Reproductive Health Matters 12.23 (2004): 144-54.

He played college football for the Virginia Cavaliers and the University of Richmond Spiders football team. Personal Michael Rocco is the nephew of former UVA football assistant Danny Rocco and now head football coach of University of Richmond. His grandfather served as an assistant under Penn State head coach Joe Paterno. High school Michael Rocco attended Liberty Christian Academy in Lynchburg, Virginia. He was a four-year starter at Liberty Christian as he passed for 2,066 yards, 24 touchdowns and rushed for seven scores as a junior in 2008. In 2009, he suffered a broken left arm and dislocated left wrist before the start of his senior season. He eventually returned for Liberty Christian's final five regular season games and led the Bulldogs to the 2009 VIS state championship game, passing for 235 yards and three touchdowns in a 48‚Äì28 loss to Collegiate School (Richmond, Virginia). He was rated the overall number 109th quarterback in the nation by ESPN. College Michael Rocco appeared in six of Virginia's 12 games as true freshmen. He played under starting quarterback Marc Verica. He went 4-of-6 with a touchdown for 64 yards in his collegiate debut against Virginia Military Institute He went a perfect 3-of-3 for 12 yards in the second quarter at Boston College on November 20. He completed at least one pass in every appearance which included games against VMI, University of North Carolina, Eastern Michigan University, Maryland, Boston College, and Virginia Tech. He competed with redshirt sophomore Ross Metheny, redshirt freshman Michael Strauss, and true freshman David Watford for the starting job for the 2011 season. As spring practice ended, and going into fall camp, Rocco began to separate himself from the other players. In the last two weeks of fall camp, the majority of the reps were given to both Rocco and true freshman David Watford who began to improve dramatically. During a press conference a week before the season opener, coach Mike London named Rocco the starter, and also stated that Watford will share time with him as well. On September 3, UVA opened their season at home against William and Mary. Rocco played well in his first start, completing 21 of 29 passes for 174 yards with neither a touchdown or interception. He will again split snaps with the speedy Watford for upcoming games. In the second game of the season at Indiana, Rocco struggled to throw the ball down field while throwing two interceptions. He completed 15 of 29 passes and threw for 191 yards. UVA gave up a 20-point lead as the Hoosiers scored 28 unanswered following different turnovers by the cavs, which included an ugly interception by Rocco. He responded well on the next drive, driving the Hoos 77 yards for a touchdown, and a game-tying two-point conversion. He threw two game-winning touchdowns to tight end Jake McGee to win the Penn State and University of Miami game. After the conclusion of his junior season at UVA, he transferred to the University of Richmond. However, the NCAA denied his waiver to play immediately, and he sat out the 2013 season. Rocco started the 2014 season as the backup to quarterback Michael Strauss at Richmond. He scored his first touchdown of the season against his former team, the University of Virginia, on September 6, 2014.

These guns were developed in the context of a contest, started in December 1955, for replacing the company-level RP-46 light machine gun and the battalion-level \\"heavy\\" (in the old sense of the term) machine gun SGM with a single new machine gun that could fulfill both roles using different mounts. Garanin's first prototype for this competition operated on the principle of lever-delayed blowback. This prototype was rejected in 1957 for failing to meet several of the technical requirements for accuracy and reliability. A later prototype of Garanin relied on gas operation; this one was rejected in 1960, because it was considered inferior to the front-runner designs of Nikitin and Kalashnikov.–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ú–û–ù–ï–¢–ß–ò–ö–û–í, –†–£–°–°–ö–ò–ï –û–†–£–ñ–ï–ô–ù–ò–ö–ò: –°–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å –µ–¥–∏–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—É–ª–µ–º–µ—Ç–∞ , Bratishka issue of July‚ÄìAugust 2003 (in Russian) Ultimately, Kalashnikov's PK machine gun won the competition. Overview (first variant)  The weapon was unusual among contemporary machine guns by its use of a lever-delayed blowback operation. When firing, the pressure pushing the case head rearward initiated an impulse on a cam that sent the bolt carrier rearward. After a certain distance, a link (in this case the firing pin) pulled the bolt head, hence extracting the spent case. Since there was no primary extraction, the chamber was fluted to allow powder gases to flow back, unsticking the case from the wall chamber like on Heckler & Koch type roller-delayed blowback weapons. The machine gun could be used as a LMG with a bipod or as a medium machine gun with a tripod. When used with a tripod for continuous fire, the gun was fitted with a heavier barrel. In the LMG configuration, the machine gun was a relatively light weapon to carry. The lower receiver of the weapon came from an RPD with a modified stock.

The son of Rhode Island President John Coggeshall Sr., he was raised in the village of Castle Hedingham in northeastern Essex where his father was a merchant. Aged about eight, he sailed from England with his parents and surviving siblings, arriving in New England in 1632. He was first active in civil affairs in 1653 when he became treasurer of the island towns of Portsmouth and Newport. The following year brought the re-unification of the colony, with the island towns rejoining the government with Providence and Warwick, and he served as treasurer of the four towns for a year. His name appears on a list of Newport freemen in 1655, and for the following 35 years he served almost continuously in one or multiple roles including Assistant, General Treasurer, Deputy, General Recorder, and Major for the Island. He was one of ten Assistants named in the Royal Charter of 1663, which would become the basis for Rhode Island's government for nearly two centuries. In 1686 he became the Deputy Governor under Governor Walter Clarke, but his term lasted only a month when the English crown assigned Edmund Andros to be Governor of all the New England colonies under the Dominion of New England. Following the demise of this dominion and the arrest of Andros in 1689, Coggeshall was once again selected as Deputy Governor for the year ending in May 1690, serving under Governor Henry Bull. In April 1676, during King Philip's War, he was on a committee to procure boats for the colony's defense. Later that year, in August, he was a member of a court martial for the trial of several Indians. Coggeshall had 16 children with three different wives. IN 1647 he married his first wife, Elizabeth Baulston, the daughter of magistrate William Baulston, and this marriage ended in a divorce which was granted by the Assembly in 1655. Elizabeth then married Thomas Gould, and Coggeshall was married later that year to Patience Throckmorton. This marriage produced nine children and lasted until her death in 1676, after which he married a wife named Mary (Hedge) Sturgis, with whom he had four more children. Coggeshall wrote a will in June 1708, and died on 1 October of that year.

Bush administration. Kyoto Protocol In March 2001, the Bush Administration announced that it would not implement the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty signed in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan that would require nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, claiming that ratifying the treaty would create economic setbacks in the U.S. and does not put enough pressure to limit emissions from developing nations.Alex Kirby, US blow to Kyoto hopes, 2001-03-28, BBC News (online). In February 2002, Bush announced his alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, by bringing forth a plan to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gases by 18 percent over 10 years. The intensity of greenhouse gases specifically is the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions and economic output, meaning that under this plan, emissions would still continue to grow, but at a slower pace. Bush stated that this plan would prevent the release of 500 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, which is about the equivalent of 70 million cars from the road. This target would achieve this goal by providing tax credits to businesses that use renewable energy sources.Bush unveils voluntary plan to reduce global warming, CNN.com, 2002-02-14. Influence of industry groups In June 2005, US State Department papers showed the Bush administration thanking Exxon executives for the company's \\"active involvement\\" in helping to determine climate change policy, including the U.S. stance on Kyoto. Input from the business lobby group Global Climate Coalition was also a factor. The Bush administration implemented an industry-formulated disinformation campaign designed to actively mislead the American public on global warming and to forestall limits on \\"climate polluters,\\" according to a report in Rolling Stone magazine which reviews hundreds of internal government documents and former government officials. \\"'They've got a political clientele that does not want to be regulated,' says Rick S. Piltz, a former Bush climate official who blew the whistle on White House censorship of global-warming documents in 2005.

Also, the White House removed key portions of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report given to the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee about the dangers to human health of global warming.Associated Press, Oct. 24, 2007, http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/G/GLOBAL_WARMING_HEALTH?SITE=NVREN&SECTION;=HOME&TEMPLATE;=DEFAULT; also archived at http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/10/24/4772/ According to one CDC official familiar with both the CDC version and the version given to the Senate, the version given to the Senate was \\"eviscerated.\\" The White House prevented the Senate and thus the public from receiving key CDC estimates in the report about diseases likely to flourish in a warmer climate, increased injuries and deaths from severe weather such as hurricanes, more respiratory problems from drought-driven air pollution, an increase in waterborne diseases including cholera, increases in vector-borne diseases including malaria and hantavirus, mental health problems such as depression and post-traumatic stress, and how many people might be adversely affected because of increased warming. US officials, such as Philip Cooney, have repeatedly edited scientific reports from US government scientists, Campbell, D. (June 20, 2003) \\"White House cuts global warming from report\\" Guardian Unlimited many of whom, such as Thomas Knutson, have been ordered to refrain from discussing climate change and related topics.Donaghy, T., et al.

Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, claimed in a widely cited New York Times article in 2006 that his superiors at the agency were trying to \\"censor\\" information \\"going out to the public.\\" NASA denied this, saying that it was merely requiring that scientists make a distinction between personal, and official government, views in interviews conducted as part of work done at the agency. Several scientists working at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have made similar complaints; once again, government officials said they were enforcing long-standing policies requiring government scientists to clearly identify personal opinions as such when participating in public interviews and forums. In 2006, the BBC's long-running current affairs series Panorama investigated the issue, and was told that \\"scientific reports about global warming have been systematically changed and suppressed.\\" According to an Associated Press release on January 30, 2007, > ...climate scientists at seven government agencies say they have been > subjected to political pressure aimed at downplaying the threat of global > warming.

Critics writing in the Wall Street Journal editorial page claim that the survey was itself unscientific. Attempts to suppress scientific information on global warming and other issues have been described by Chris Mooney as constituting a Republican War on Science. Attempts to undermine U.S. and state efforts The Bush Administration worked to undermine state efforts to mitigate global warming. Mary Peters, the Transportation Secretary at that time, personally directed US efforts to urge governors and dozens of members of the House of Representatives to block California's first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks, according to e-mails obtained by Congress.\\"How the White House Worked to Scuttle California's Climate Law\\", San Francisco Chronicle, September 25, 2007 http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/09/25/4099/ References Category:Climate change policy in the United States Category:Politics of the United States Category:United States federal policy Category:Presidency of George W.

It is directed by Will Bakke, produced by Michael B. Allen and Alex Carroll, and stars Michael B. Allen, Will Bakke, Alex Carroll, and Matt Owen. It is Will Bakke's second documentary film. Production began in April 2009 in Dallas, Texas and completed in April 2010. The film had limited screening around the US since it premiered on April 3, 2010, and was released on DVD January 14, 2011. The film is notable for its controversial title and unique distribution model of \\"Name- Your-Own-Price\\". Plot Alex, Matt, Michael, and Will have grown up as Bible-believing Christians who did all the right things. As they've grown older, they've realized that the Jesus in the Bible doesn't exactly look like the healthy, wealthy, American Jesus they've been trained to know and love. They soon realize that their biases and allegiances to worldly things have determined their views on Christianity. So, they decided to leave the United States for a while and reexamine what Jesus says about certain topics. Their travels feature 10 European cities including Barcelona, Rome, Zagreb, Budapest, and Munich. Beginning in London, they narrate city by city from a studio roundtable, tackling topics such as materialism, sexuality, alcohol, and entertainment. As the journey progresses, they build a deep bond with each other and discover a new meaning for the words, ‚Äútrusting in Jesus.‚Äù By the end of their adventure, they truly begin to understand the joy and redemption that comes from giving up the world to follow Jesus.

Distribution A notable characteristic of Beware of Christians is the distribution strategy of the film. After negotiating with a number of larger distributors, the producers decided to self-distribute the film for Name-Your-Own-Price. The initial distribution was launched along with a spring tour, during which the producers of the film traveled to over 35 cities to screen the film and answer questions from their audiences. The distribution was funded largely by a Kickstarter campaign which raised over $25,000. Riot Studios is currently selling the film via their online store for \\"Name-Your-Own-Price\\".

The seat being vacated is currently held by Robert A. Freedberg, who decided not to run in the election because he would face mandatory retirement due to his age in three years. Primary campaign Vic Stabile, a partner in a Harrisburg law firm, and Paula A. Patrick, a judge on the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, faced off for the Republican nomination. Both candidates received a rating of \\"recommended\\" from the Pennsylvania Bar Association. Stabile won the endorsement of the Republican State Committee. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also endorsed Stabile for the Republican nomination. The Philadelphia Inquirer endorsed Patrick. On the Democratic side, David N. Wecht, currently a judge on the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, was the only candidate to file; therefore he ran unopposed in the Democratic primary election. He received a rating of \\"highly recommended\\" from the Pennsylvania Bar Association. The election was held on May 17, 2011. Stabile won the Republican primary, receiving 378,566 votes (65.3%) against Patrick's 200,856 (34.7%). Wecht received 605,665 votes (100.0%). General election Stabile and Wecht faced each other in the general election. Wecht was endorsed in the general election by the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, which both cited his judicial experience. Stabile was endorsed by The Patriot-News, which cited his \\"down-to-earth approach\\". In the general election on November 8, Wecht won the seat with 1,029,560 votes (54.5%) against Stabile's 859,687 (45.5%). Judge of the Commonwealth Court There was one vacancy on the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. The seat to be vacated is currently held by Johnny Butler, who decided not to run in the election. Primary campaign Anne Covey, a private attorney, and Paul P. Panepinto, a judge on the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, contended for the Republican nomination. They received bar association ratings of \\"recommended\\" and \\"highly recommended\\", respectively. Covey won the endorsement of the Republican State Committee. Covey was also endorsed for the Republican nomination by both the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Kathryn Boockvar, an attorney who most recently worked for the Advancement Project and had previously spent 11 years in private practice, and Barbara Behrend Ernsberger, who has spent her career in private practice, competed for the Democratic nomination. Boockvar received a rating of \\"recommended\\" from the Pennsylvania Bar Association; Ernsberger received a rating of \\"not recommended\\" because she did not participate in the bar association evaluation process. Boockvar won the endorsement of the Democratic State Committee. The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also endorsed Boockvar for the Democratic nomination. In the election on May 17, 2011, Covey received 406,764 votes (70.3%) and Panepinto received 171,996 (29.7%). The Democratic race was much closer: the initial results showed that Boockvar had received 311,624 votes (50.2%) and Ernsberger had received 309,508 (49.8%). Because the margin was less than half of a percent, these results triggered a recount, mandatory unless waived by the trailing candidate. Ernsberger declined to waive her right to a recount. On June 8, 2011, the Secretary of the Commonwealth announced that the recount had confirmed Boockvar's victory. The figures were nearly the same; in the final tally, Boockvar had 311,732 votes (50.2%) and Ernsberger had 309,680 (49.8%). General election Covey and Boockvar faced each other in the general election. Covey was endorsed in the general election by the Philadelphia Inquirer, which noted her \\"quasi-judicial experience of having served on the state's labor relations board\\". Boockvar was endorsed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The Patriot-News, which both praised her breadth of experience. In the general election on November 8, Covey won with 978,634 votes (52.4%) against Boockvar's 890,701 (47.6%).

Route description  Starting from Roseburg on OR 138, at the junction with Interstate 5, the scenic byway travels eastward. Near Glide, it begins to parallel the North Umpqua River. It continues roughly eastward until it meets Diamond Lake, where it turns southward along the east shore of the lake. Near the southern tip of the lake the scenic byway turns west and then southwest on OR 230. Here it follows the Rogue River, eventually merges with OR 62 near Union Creek. On its last leg the route meets up with OR 234 and passes near Upper and Lower Table Rock. The byway's terminus is at Gold Hill. The entire scenic byway is long.

Nelson was an American political activist who served as chairman of the Massachusetts Republican State Committee from 1976 to 1980. Early life Nelson was born on August 18, 1941 in Brookline, Massachusetts. He attended Newton Public Schools and graduated from Newton High School and attended Harvard University, but dropped out to get involved in politics. Early political involvement Nelson first became involved in politics in 1964 when he worked for Barry Goldwater's Presidential campaign. He was also a founder and executive director of the Massachusetts chapter of Young Americans for Freedom. After Goldwater's loss, Nelson stated out of politics for five years, but returned to oppose the policies of Governor Francis W. Sargent. In 1974 he worked for Sargent's Republican primary opponent, Carroll Sheehan. In February 1975 he formed Republicans for an Effective Grass Roots Organization (REGRO), a grassroots organization that sought to attract disenchanted Democrats to the Republican Party. Presidential campaigns In 1972 Nelson directed Richard M. Nixon's canvassing efforts in Massachusetts. In 1976 he was a leader in Massachusetts in Ronald Reagan's campaign against incumbent President Gerald Ford for the GOP Presidential nomination. In 1980 he and William Weld were co- chairmen for Congressman's Phil Crane's short-lived bid for the GOP Presidential nomination. Nelson would ultimately endorse Ronald Reagan. Chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party On May 19, 1976, Nelson, backed by the conservative REGRO faction of the party, defeated Andrew Card, the consensus choice of the moderates, by two votes to become Chairman of the Republican State Committee. He was the first Jew elected to this position. Nelson was also a delegate to that year's Republican National Convention. Nelson sought to win elections with a conservative ideology and grassroots campaigning. He sought to convert conservative, ethnic Democrats to the Republican party, as he thought they would feel more at home in a conservative Republican Party than a liberal Democratic one. To raise grassroots support and soften the party's \\"Rich Brahmin\\" image, Nelson launched a door-to-door effort to recruit new workers to local committees called Project Precinct. Nelson was one of RNC Chairman Bill Brock's most tenacious adversaries. Nelson desired an ideological crusade while Brock emphasized technological innovation. In 1978, Republican Senator Edward Brooke lost his re-election bid and liberal Republican Francis W. Hatch, Jr. lost his campaign for governor to conservative Democrat Edward J. King. Nelson was criticized by some Republicans, which included Hatch, John A. Volpe, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., John W. Sears, William L. Saltonstall, Lewis Crampton, and Avi Nelson, for being narrowly supportive of conservative candidates and being unable to smooth over differences within the party. On April 8, 1980 he was defeated by State Representative Andrew Natsios 41 votes to 35. Later life and death Following his defeat, Nelson defeated former Massachusetts Governor John Volpe to become Republican National Committeeman. He tried to regain the chairmanship from Natsios, but was unsuccessful. In 1984, Nelson lost his reelection bid for committeeman by 1 vote to Daniel Needham Jr. Nelson encouraged William Weld to run for Governor of Massachusetts in 1990. However, he later supported Steven Pierce over Weld in the Republican primary. Nelson also led a group of Republicans that supported acting Mayor of Boston Thomas Menino in the 1993 election. Outside politics Nelson worked as a stockbroker and was a second vice president with Shearson Lehman Brothers. Nelson died on July 21, 1993 in Boston of a cerebral hemorrhage.

Its name derives from the Iron Market (Eisenmarkt), which was held in the immediate vicinity until the 19th century. The Iron Tower served as a watchtower and gate to the city, and later as a gaol. It was badly damaged in World War II and reconstructed in the 1960s. Today it houses various organizations and art projects and is used for art exhibitions. Historical background: the defenses of Mainz Since late Roman times, the city of Mainz (then Mogontiacum) was defended by a wall with watchtowers and city gates. The first wall was built shortly before the destruction of the limes in 259/260 CE. Not long after 350, in the course of the abandonment of the Roman camp, this wall was lowered and rubble (spolia) from earlier construction used to enlarge and strengthen it. After the Romans withdrew, it was improved at various times, particularly in the Merovingian and Carolingian periods, becoming what archaeologists studying the city have called the \\"Roman- Carolingian\\" wall. However, in 1160 the continuity of the city's defenses was drastically interrupted. There was a longstanding dispute between the citizens of Mainz and their archbishop, Arnold of Selenhofen (and also with the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa); after the archbishop was murdered, the emperor imposed an imperial ban on the city. The city walls and towers were razed (although it is possible that on the inland side the destruction was only partial).Die mittelalterliche Stadtbefestigung von Mainz, Festung Mainz 2008, retrieved 3 May 2011 However, Mainz was an important political and strategic ally in the Hohenstaufens' struggle for supremacy in the German Empire against the Welfs, and so in circa 1190-1200 the city was granted permission to rebuild the defences. The Iron Tower was built in this phase of construction, as one of a total of 34 gate towers and watchtowers. Late Romanesque carving of a lion on the Iron Gate (c. 1240) Style and construction phases The round-arched late Romanesque gateway at the base of the tower dates to the first half of the 13th century, probably around 1240. On the Rhine side, the arch is embellished with two Romanesque carvings of lions in sandstone, atop ornamental capitals over fluted cornerstones. One lion grasps a ram in its paws, sometimes interpreted as a symbol of the power of the Church, while the second grasp a dragon or other fabulous animal, symbolizing secular power. The lions, an embodiment of defensive vigilance in Romanesque art, are executed in a characteristically stylised manner. In the first half of the 15th century, the tower was raised to 6 stories. Towards the end of the 16th century (or possibly as early as the start of the 14th), the gateway lost its function and the entrance to the city was moved to the so- called \\"Little Iron Door\\" (Eisent√ºrlein) in a smaller building attached to the tower. In the 18th century, the Iron Tower was enclosed on the Rhine side by a wall. This remained until the early years of the 20th century. On the other, L√∂hrstra√üe, side, there were small Fachwerk houses until 1945. The Iron Tower around 1900, enclosed by a wall Mediaeval and modern uses Until the 16th century, the Iron Tower was one of the towers and gateways in the city walls. In the Middle Ages, shipping on the Rhine was of major importance, so the riverside was heavily used and was the trading center of the city. Thus the Iron Tower and the other Rhine-side towers of the city (the Wood Tower, Fish Tower, etc.) formed a secular counterbalance to the many church towers on the city skyline. In the Middle Ages, the Mainz iron traders held their market around the tower, giving it the name by which it is still known. Beginning in the 17th century, the upper stories of the Iron Tower were used as the main goal of what was then the French city of Mayence. Prominent prisoners held there included some officers of the L√ºtzow Free Corps in 1813, and the Mainz revolutionaries from the March Revolution of 1848/49 until they were pardoned in 1850.Historisches Mainz: Der Eisenturm, Landeshauptstadt Mainz 2011, retrieved 3 May 2011 In 1900, the Iron Tower was to be torn down but was saved by the Mainz Association of Antiquities (Mainzer Altertumsverein) and in 1905 became the property of the city. After this, it housed a painter's studio and small flats. The courtyard behind the wall on the Rhine side was used for temporary storage of old stone monuments. Destruction and rebuilding In World War II, the entire center of the city, including the Iron Tower, was severely damaged. After an air raid in February 1945, the roof and interior of the tower were completely destroyed by fire, as were the houses built around the tower. In 1958 it was rebuilt and given a new slate-covered hipped roof. The wall around it was removed in the early 1970s in the course of renovation of the neighboring Zum Brand housing development. On both sides of the tower, the adjacent buildings and a portion of the city wall were reconstructed to reproduce the medieval structures as accurately as possible. The ashlar corners and painted joints were also restored based on remnants of the original. The tower gateway in 2006 Today The Iron Tower currently houses the Kunstverein Eisenturm Mainz (Mainz Iron Tower Art Association), which has a nationwide reputation in Germany. The artists use the tower as a gallery and exhibition space and award a prize named for it. Other public services and organizations, for example, the Mainz photography club and Mainz Rotaract, are also based in the tower. The tower may be visited as part of the national European Heritage Days, Tag des offenen Denkmals. ReferencesSources * Ernst Stephan. Das B√ºrgerhaus in Mainz. Das deutsche B√ºrgerhaus XVIII.

M. Sohail Trust S.M.Sohail Trust is named after a legal luminary of Karachi, who was an active participant in the freedom movement as President of Provincial Muslim League and also President of Bihar Relief Fund. After 1947, he became Secretary of the Pakistan Bar Council, founding Managing Director of Karachi Co-operative Housing Union and Chairman Public Accounts Committee of West Pakistan Assembly. He was an ardent advocate of education and founded Sharfabad English School. His son, Professor Dr. Syed Tariq Sohail, an eminent Psychiatrist, Educationist and Civil Society Activist, inherited Mr. S. M. Sohail‚Äôs passion for education. He established the S.M. Sohail Trust in 1996, which owns Jinnah Medical and Dental College and the attached teaching Hospitals: Jinnah Medical College Hospital, Medicare Dental Hospital and Medicare Heart and General. Mission statement The decision taken by the Trust to establish a new medical college was based on its desire to raise the standards of medical education in Pakistan. Conscious that a high level of professional competence has to be attained by medical students, the Trust planned a system of instruction in which the emphasis is on interactive, small group tutorials, problem-based and community-based learning, relevant to our particular culture. As the world is shrinking rapidly, Jinnah Medical and Dental College students are encouraged to keep abreast of the latest developments in the medical sciences. Other vital aspects of education, too often ignored by medical educationists are emphasized to include communication skills, language skills and courses in humanities. As part of the curriculum, students will also be trained to write and speak effectively, giving them the confidence to pursue graduate studies and participate effectively in seminars and conferences at national and international levels. The College desires its students to develop leadership qualities and a team spirit. The strategy for fulfilling this Mission is based on student-teacher interaction, community- based instruction, and further support in the form of a good library, audio- visual aids, skills laboratory, computer-assisted learning and an active humanities department.

Biography Saint Augustine chapel in Milan Pagani was born in Valsolda, now a municipality in the Province of Como in the Italian region Lombardy, located about north of Milan and bordering Switzerland. In 1667 he moved to Venice, where he made a series of ten aquatints from works by Giuseppe Diamantini (1621-1705). In 1675 he painted the Martyrdom of St. Erasmus. The painting was exhibited at Palazzo Molin, and is currently located in the National Gallery of Spinola in Genoa. In 1690 he was invited to Vienna by the Emperor Leopold I. In 1696 he returned to Valsolda where he frescoed what is considered his masterwork: the nave of the parish church of San Martino.San Martino ceiling, description of work, and link to local museum. The work, completed the year of the birth of Tiepolo, who would master the art of the luminous fresco, astounds with the use of bright colors and swirling sotto in su perspective as a fresco technique.

History=Formation After touring and releasing albums for nearly nine years, Ronnie Vannucci Jr of The Killers and his bandmates went on hiatus. Shortly, he enlisted the help of a longtime friend and former band member (from Expert on October) Taylor Milne to record a solo album. Matt Sharp and Ted Sablay (formerly of Expert on October) also helped contribute bass parts to the album. The band's live lineup on their first tour consisted of Ronnie Vannucci on vocals and guitar; Taylor Milne on guitar; Alex Stopa on drums; Tyson Henrie on bass; and John Spiker on keyboards, guitar and background vocals. In May 2015, live shows in support of the new album consisted of band members Ronnie Vannucci on vocals and guitar; Taylor Milne on guitar and backing vocals; John Spiker on bass, keyboards and backing vocals; John Konesky on guitar and keyboards; and Brooks Wackerman on drums. Big Talk (2011) Grammy Award-winning producer Joe Chiccarelli (The Strokes, My Morning Jacket, The Shins) worked with the band on their debut album. It was recorded between November 2010 and January 2011 at Battle Born Studios, and was then mixed at London's Assault & Battery by Alan Moulder (U2, The Killers, Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins). Former Weezer bassist Matt Sharp and Ted Sablay (who toured with The Killers) also helped out on the album. The first single, \\"Getaways\\", was released on May 10, 2011. Big Talk released its eponymous debut album on July 12, 2011, on Vannucci's own label 'Little Oil' in association with Epitaph Records. It first streamed in full via Much Music on July 12, 2011 and then on ABC's Music Lounge on July 13, 2011. NME streamed the album exclusively. Big Talk made their live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on July 25, 2011. Straight In No Kissin (2015) For Big Talk's second album, Vannucci and collaborator John Spiker (of Tenacious D) produced the album in a basement studio Vannucci built. The band line-up now officially includes John Konesky (guitar), John Spiker (bass), and Brooks Wackerman (of Bad Religion, drums). The first single, \\"What Happened to Delisa?\\" was released in June 2015. Straight In No Kissin was released on July 24, 2015; the album's cover features artwork of the five band members in drag accompanied by Vannucci's pet boxer Archie.

It displays properties which illustrate promise for cancer treatments, but still requires further research.  History and background  Dynemicin A was first isolated from the soil in the Gujarat State of India. It was discovered to be the natural product of the indigenous bacteria Micromonospora chersina. The natural product displays a bright purple color due to the anthraquinone chromophore structure within it. Initially, this compound was isolated for its aesthetic properties as a dye until further research demonstrated its anti-cancer properties. Shortly after the compound's discovery, the Bristol-Myers Pharmaceutical Company elucidated the structure in Japan using X-ray diffraction studies of triacetyldynemicin A; a closely related compound.  Synthesis  The first reported chemical synthesis of dynemicin was accomplished by Myers and coworkers.  Biosynthesis  Dynemicin A is an antitumor natural product isolated from Micromonospora chersina which causes DNA strand cleavage. Iwasaki et al. first studied the biosynthetic pathway of Dynemicin A by 13C NMR labeling experiments. Dynemicin A is thought to be biosynthesized separately from two different heptaketide chains originated from seven head-to-tail coupled acetate units, which is then connected to form Dynemicin A. Initially, precursors such as 3 and 4 were proposed to derive from the oleate/crepenynate pathway, as initially put forth for NSC Chrom A biosynthesis. However, recent work by Thorson and coworkers revealed the biosynthesis of the dynemicin enediyne core to be catalyzed by an enediyne polyketide synthase (PKSE) similar to that employed in calicheamicin biosynthesis. center  Mechanism of action  Dynemicin A is specific for B-DNA, and functions by intercalating into the minor groove of the double helix. For intercalation to occur, the separation between strands, which is usually 3-4 angstroms, needs to be widened to 7-8 angstroms to allow enough space for the ligand to bind. Given this, the DNA must be strained to accommodate the Dynemicin A, resulting in an induced fit-like process. Once intercalated within the DNA, the epoxide is activated in one of two ways. First, if NADPH or a thiol reduces the molecule the Bergman re-cyclization of the enediyne proceeds. Second, if a nucleophilic mechanism is utilized then the retro-Bergman re-cyclization of the enediyne is used. The final products of these two mechanisms are outlined below. When the re-cyclization occurs, the conformational changes and chemical reactions taking place result in an irreversible double stranded cleavage of the DNA, leading to cell death. During in vitro studies, the molecule showed an increased affinity for the specific 10 base pair sequence CTACTACTTG. However, in vivo studies have yet to confirm this phenomenon. Professor Martin Semmelhack of Princeton University was the first person to propose the NADPH reduction pathway.  Pharmacological properties  The pharmacological properties of this drug have not yet been fully explored but currently suggest that it may be a more potent anti-cancer agent than other chemotherapeutic drugs. The bacterium is believed to use dynemicin A as an antibacterial agent to help it survive in its niche in the environment. Dynemicin A, as a drug, specifically targets B-DNA and is most effective in rapidly dividing cells. The broad spectrum of the drug prevents current use because it creates unwanted damage in normal healthy tissues. In vivo studies in mice and rats suggest that the treatment is most effective in leukemia, breast, and lung cancers. Synthetic alternatives which are more specific to cancer cells and leave healthy tissues unharmed are being researched. Other animal models are available, but have proven ineffective and therefore have no human trials currently underway. The enediyne property of this drug relates to another antibiotic known as neocarzinostatin which is approved for clinical use. As with dynemicin A, neocarzinostatin also interacts with DNA.

Australian White lambs aged 14 weeks Young group of Australian White ewe lambs Australian White lamb 4 weeks old in the southeastern USA Australian White is a large, white breed of Australian meat sheep which was originally developed for Australian conditions. The Australian White sheep are a stabilised composite haired meat breed comprising White Dorper, Van Rooy, Poll Dorset and Texel genetics. Development The original key objectives in developing the breed were: * A meat sheep that did not need shearing or crutching * Was resistant to pests (lice and flies) * A polyestrous ewe that could be joined year-round * An animal with good carcass shape and eating quality The end goal was to produce lamb in a more economical and viable way, reducing costs, labor and increasing yield whilst still retaining good eating quality. The lamb was designed to better meet the needs of large scale meat lamb producing systems without the complications that come with producing wool. The Australian White is now recognized for its excellent eating qualities. It is a fine textured (fine grained), very soft and clean tasting meat. It is high in omegas, which is its single most distinguishing factor from other sheep breeds. History The Australian White (AW) was developed on the Tattykeel properties in Black Springs, NSW, Australia by two brothers, Graham and Martin Gilmore, over several years and was launched in 2011. Utilizing embryo transfer, artificial insemination, and selective line breeding, the ‚Äúbest‚Äù characteristics of the four source breeds were used to develop the AW. The original design was to be a self-replacing meat sheep that sheds its own hair, can survive in extreme weather conditions (from cold and wet to hot and arid environments), early maturing, and breed year-round. During the development of the breed its unique eating qualities were evident; however, it was not until later (November 2016) that the scientific reasons for its excellent eating qualities were discovered by Associate Professor Aduli E.O. Malau-Aduli, PhD. The AW breed can now be found all over the world in countries such as New Zealand, China, Inner Mongolia, and the United States. The first AW embryo transfer program was done in 2010 at Tattykeel properties. Since then many programs have been conducted each year at the farm with animals going through rigorous selection to continually improve the desired traits, conformation and eating quality. A flock of Australian White Sheep in Mudgegonga, Victoria, Australia Characteristics=Physical traits A typical ram will have a long, straight top line and a deep body with a solid barrel. Average ram mature weights range from 240 to 265lbs (110 to 120kg). The ram‚Äôs head is more masculine with both good breadth and depth, and his pigment tends to be slightly darker than the ewe‚Äôs. The ram‚Äôs beam shape slightly tapers near the shoulders. A typical ewe shows good length, depth, and width as well as good twist in the hind legs for great balance. Average ewe mature weights are 150 to 175lbs (68 to 80kg). Their heads tend to demonstrate more feminine characteristics with smoother transitions across the skull. They build a thick coat during the winter, and their hair becomes finer post-shedding during the warmer months. The AW is selected for a thick and supple hide. The density and thickness of the winter coat varies according to the weather conditions of the area in which they are being raised. Production traits The AW matures early in life at around 10-12 months of age. Early maturing breeds are generally more efficient in terms of maintenance, breeding, and growth of lambs for slaughter. Growth rates being achieved between 16-18 weeks of age are 105-115lbs (48-52kg). As the breed was developed to finish on grass; the lambs do not need to be grown out or finished on grain under normal conditions. The quick turn around and reduced cost to finish the lambs is resulting in increased profit margins for commercial producers. AWs have a quiet temperament and can have low maintenance requirements in various production systems. Meat quality traits The meat quality traits of the AW are the biggest distinguishing factors of the breed. Tattykeel has conducted extensive testing on the intramuscular fat (IMF) and fat melting point (FMP) of the AW. The FMP is significantly lower between 82-95¬∞F (28-35¬∞C) (typical lamb is 110¬∞F/43¬∞C) achieving a similar result to that of Wagyu beef (which generally has a FMP below body temperature 98¬∞F/36.7¬∞C) without the need for long term grain feeding. Traits such as IMF and FMP are indicative of the amount of the long chain omega-3 fatty acids levels and have effect on taste and tenderness. Polyunsaturated fats, in particular long chain omega-3s, are known to aid in cardiovascular health as well as many other benefits. The average AW lamb has significantly elevated levels of omega 3s when compared to other breeds and popular consumer red meats. The AW is the exclusive breed used in the recently released Margra brand created in 2019 for distribution in the United States. The brand name combines the names, Martin and Graham, who were the two most influential developers of the Australian White breed. Margra lamb boasts premium quality and consistency of product. Ongoing research Tattykeel continues to conduct research on meat eating qualities of their Australian White sheep with Associate Professor Aduli E.O. Malau-Aduli, PhD. To ensure the animals are not harmed during the testing, biopsies of the meat are taken from live animals under clinical conditions. Current testing is being used to identify the best lines of animals for eating quality and is proving that the eating quality in these animals is highly heritable. Development of a proprietary DNA signature, correlations with omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, key sensory eating quality characteristics in Tattykeel Australian White sheep have been branded as a lamb product that is genetically different to other lamb breeds marketed on the basis of sensory eating quality characteristics. This project has the ability to see lamb as a protein cross over from the food industry to the health sector due to its high content of long chain omega-3.

Biography Linzee was born in Plymouth, Devon, the son of John Linzee and Susannah Inman, and named in honour of Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood, who was married to his father's cousin, Susannah. His father was a Royal Navy captain, and had served during the American War, commanding the sloop from October 1774 until after July 1776, and saw action at the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775. Although his infant son Samuel's name appeared on the ship's muster roll as captain's servant and senior clerk, it is highly improbable that Samuel was on board the ship, but it did count towards the years of sea time necessary for all candidates for a lieutenant's commission. Samuel Linzee subsequently received his on 21 July 1790, aged only sixteen and a half. He was promoted to commander on 5 November 1793, and to post-captain on 8 March 1794, only two months past his 20th birthday, and given command of the 28-gun sixth-rate frigate . On 9 December 1795, the French frigate Sensible and corvette Sardine captured Nemesis while she was at anchor in the neutral port of Smyrna. Nemesis did not resist and Linzee protested the illegality of the action. The British frigates Aigle and blockaded the three ships until Ganteaume's squadron drove the British ships off. The French sailed Nemesis to Tunis in January 1796, but the British recaptured her on 9 March. Linzee travelled home via Venice, Vienna, Dresden, Prague, and Berlin, and eventually returned to England in a packet boat from Hamburg in mid-1796. At 8 a.m. on 26 January 1801, Linzee, newly in command of the 36-gun frigate, Oiseau (the former ) sighted the French 36-gun frigate , which was bound from Cayenne to Rochefort with despatches. The Oiseau pursued D√©daigneuse alone until noon the next day when, with Cape Finisterre in sight, the frigates and joined the chase. Eventually D√©daigneuse surrendered to the Oiseau around 2.45 p.m. on the 28th, and was taken into service in the Royal Navy. Linzee commanded the 74-gun ship during the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801, and was in the fleet of Rear Admiral George Campbell which sailed from England to Port Royal in 1802, and returned to England in May of that year. He commanded the 74-gun from early 1805 until April 1806, and was part of Sir Robert Calder's fleet when he engaged a combined French and Spanish fleet at the Battle of Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805. In February 1807 Linzee was appointed commander of the 74-gun ship . One of his first duties, on 6 March, was to sit on the court martial of Sir Home Riggs Popham after the failed invasion of South America. On 19 July 1807 he commanded Maida in the bombardment of Copenhagen and the capture of the Danish fleet. Linzee went to command the for a brief period in January and February 1809, the from 1809 to 1811, the from August 1810 to December 1811, in March 1812, and then the from April to August 1812. He was appointed a Colonel of Marines on 20 July 1811. Linzee was promoted to the flag rank of Rear Admiral of the Blue on 12 August 1812, then to Rear Admiral of the White on 4 December 1812, Rear Admiral of the Red on 4 June 1813, and finally to Vice-Admiral of the Blue on 12 August 1819. Death Linzee died on 1 September 1820, at his home at Stonehouse, Devon, at the age of 46, after an attack of apoplexy caused him to fall from his horse a few days before. A monument can be found in the north aisle of the Church of St. Andrews, Plymouth. Personal life Linzee first married Miss J. Clark, at the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, in July 1799. She and her baby died during childbirth on 28 August 1800, at Greenwich. On 7 September 1802 Linzee married Emily Wooldridge, the daughter of Captain William Wooldridge, at St Andrew's Church, Plymouth. They had nine children; the first three, all boys, were stillborn, while the fourth, named Samuel Hood Linzee, was born in August 1806, but died of smallpox on 26 December the same year. The fifth child, Emily Wooldridge Linzee, was born on 27 September 1807. The sixth, also Samuel Hood Linzee, was born on 19 December 1809, and was drowned off Cape Frio on 11 July 1831, aged only 22, while serving as a lieutenant aboard . The seventh child, John Linzee was born 22 September 1812, while the eighth, Susanna Inman Linzee, was born on 17 December 1815. The ninth and final child, Mary Ann Charlotte Linzee was born on 26 January 1818.

The tectonic processes in question include orogenesis, volcanism, and erosion, while relevant climatic processes include atmospheric circulation, orographic lift, monsoon circulation and the rain shadow effect. As the geological record of past climate changes over millions of years is sparse and poorly resolved, many questions remain unresolved regarding the nature of tectonic-climate interaction, although it is an area of active research by geologists and palaeoclimatologists. Orographic controls on climate Depending on the vertical and horizontal magnitude of a mountain range, it has the potential to have strong effects on global and regional climate patterns and processes including: deflection of atmospheric circulation, creation of orographic lift, altering monsoon circulation, and causing the rain shadow effect. Simple illustration of the rain shadow effect One example of an elevated terrain and its effect on climate occurs in the Southeast Asian Himalayas, the world's highest mountain system. A range of this size has the ability to influence geographic temperature, precipitation, and wind. Theories suggest that the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau has resulted in stronger deflections of the atmospheric jet stream, a heavier monsoonal circulation, increased rainfall on the front slopes, greater rates of chemical weathering, and thus lower atmospheric concentrations. It is possible that the spatial magnitude of this range is so great that it creates a regional monsoon circulation in addition to disrupting hemispheric-scale atmospheric circulation. Example of the rain shadow effect in the Himalayas The monsoon season in Southeast Asia occurs due to the Asian continent becoming warmer than the surrounding oceans during the summer; as a low-pressure cell is created above the continents, a high-pressure cell forms over the cooler ocean, causing advection of moist air, creating heavy precipitation from Africa to Southeast Asia. However, the intensity of the rainfall over Southeast Asia is greater than the African monsoon, which can be attributed to the awesome size of the Asian continent compared to the African continent and the presence of a vast mountain system. This not only affects the climate of Southeast Asia, but modifies the climate in neighboring areas such as Siberia, central Asia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean basin as well. To test this a model was created that changed only the topography of current landmasses, which resulted in correlations between the model and global fluctuations in precipitation and temperature over the past 40 Myr. interpreted by scientists. It is commonly agreed upon that global climate fluctuations are strongly dictated by the presence or absence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and carbon dioxide (CO2) is typically considered the most significant greenhouse gas. Observations infer that large uplifts of mountain ranges globally result in higher chemical erosion rates, thus lowering the volume of CO2 in the atmosphere as well as causing global cooling. This occurs because in regions of higher elevation there are higher rates of mechanical erosion (i.e. gravity, fluvial processes) and there is constant exposure and availability of materials available for chemical weathering. The following is a simplified equation describing the consumption of CO2 during chemical weathering of silicates: ::::::::::::::CaSiO3 \\\\+ CO2 ‚Üî CaCO3 \\\\+ SiO2 From this equation, it is inferred that carbon dioxide is consumed during chemical weathering and thus lower concentrations of the gas will be present in the atmosphere as long as chemical weathering rates are high enough.  Climate-driven tectonism  There are scientists who reject that uplift is the sole cause of climate change and are in favor of uplift as a result of climate change. Some geologists theorize that a cooler and stormier climate (such as glaciations and increased precipitation) can give a landscape a younger appearance such as incision of high terrains and increased erosion rates. Glaciers are a powerful eroding agent with the ability to incise and carve deep valleys and when rapid erosion of the earth's surface occurs, especially in an area of limited relief, it is possible for isostatic rebound to occur, creating high peaks and deep valleys. A lack of glaciation or precipitation can cause an increase in erosion, but can vary between localities. It is possible to create erosion in the absence of precipitation because there would be a decrease in vegetation, which typically acts as a protective cover for the bedrock. Peaks and valleys of the Torres del Paine range of the Andes in Chile Models also suggest that certain topographic features of the Himalayan and Andes region are determined by an erosional/climatic interaction as opposed to tectonism. These models reveal a correlation between regional precipitation and a maximum topographic limit at the plateau margin. In the southern Andes where there is relatively low precipitation and denudation rates, there is no real extreme topography present at the plateau margin while in the north there are higher rates of precipitation and the presence of extreme topography. Another interesting theory comes from an investigation of the uplift of the Andes during the Cenozoic. Some scientists hypothesize that the tectonic processes of plate subduction and mountain building are products of erosion and sedimentation. When there is an arid climate influenced by the rain shadow effect in a mountainous region, sediment supply to the trench can be reduced or even cut off. These sediments are thought to act as lubricants at the plate interface and this reduction increases the shear stress present at the interface that is large enough to support the high Andes. Volcanism=Introduction Around the world, dotting the map are volcanoes of all shapes and sizes. Lining the landmass around the Pacific Ocean are the well-known volcanoes of the Pacific Ring of Fire. From the Aleutian Islands to the Andes Mountains in Chile, these volcanoes have sculpted their local and regional environments. Aside from admiring their majestic beauty, one might wonder how these geologic wonders work and what role they play in changing the landscape and atmosphere. Principally, volcanoes are geologic features that exude magmatic material from below Earth's surface onto the surface. Upon reaching the surface, the term \\"magma\\" disappears and \\"lava\\" becomes the common nomenclature. This lava cools and forms igneous rock. By examining igneous rocks, it is possible to derive a chain of events that led from the original melt of the magma to the crystallization of the lava at Earth's surface. By examining igneous rocks, it is possible to postulate evidence for volcanic outgassing, which is known to alter atmospheric chemistry. This alteration of atmospheric chemistry changes climate cycles both globally and locally. Fundamentals of igneous rock and magmatic gas formation Magmas are the starting point for the creation of a volcano. In order to understand volcanism, it is critical to understand the processes that form volcanoes. Magmas are created by keeping temperature, pressure, and composition (known as P-T-X) in the realm of melt conditions. The pressure and temperature for melts are understood by knowing the chemistry of the melt. To keep magma in a melt condition, a change in one variable will result in the change of another variable in order to maintain equilibrium (i.e. Le Chatlier's Principle). The production of magma is accomplished in multiple ways: 1) subduction of oceanic crust, 2) creation of a hot spot from a mantle plume, and 3) divergence of oceanic or continental plates. The subduction of oceanic crust produces a magmatic melt usually at great depth. Yellowstone National Park is a hot spot located within the center of a continent. Divergence of continental plates (i.e. the Atlantic Mid-Ocean ridge complex) creates magmas very near the surface of the Earth. A plume of heat from the mantle will melt rocks, creating a hot spot, which can be located at any depth in the crust. Hot spots in oceanic crust develop different magmatic plumbing systems based on plate velocities. Hawaii and the Madeira Archipelago (off the West coast of Africa) are examples of volcanic complexes with two different plumbing systems. Because islands such as Hawaii move more quickly than Madeira, the layered rocks at Hawaii have a different chemistry than those at Madeira. The layers beneath Hawaii and Madeira are different because the magma produced underground at these locations rests for different amounts of time. The longer the amount of time magma will rest underground, the warmer the host rocks become. Fractionation of crystals from melt is partially driven by heat; therefore, the igneous rock produced will vary from an insulated host to a non-insulated host. Each of these avenues of magmatic creation develops different igneous rocks and, thus, various P-T-X histories. Definitions and other geologic explanations of igneous systems are explained in Loren A. Raymond's Petrology text.Raymond, Loren A., Petrology: The Study of Igneous, Sedimentary and Metamorphic Rocks. Waveland Press, Edition 2, May 30, 2007. In order to understand the creation of igneous rocks from a melt, it is fundamental to understand the concepts produced by Drs. Norman Bowen and Frank Tuttle from the NaAlSiO4-KAlSiO4-SiO2-H2O system. Tuttle and Bowen accomplished their work by using experimental petrologic laboratories that produce synthetic igneous materials from mixes of reagents. Observations from these experiments indicate that as a melt cools, it will produce derivative magmas and igneous rock. Following Bowen's research, the magma will crystallize a mafic igneous rock prior to a felsic igneous rock. As this crystallization process occurs in nature, pressure and temperature decrease, which changes the composition of the melt along various stages of the process. This constantly changing chemical environment alters the final composition that reaches the Earth's surface. The evolution of magmatic gases depends on the P-T-X history of the magma. These factors include the composition of assimilated materials and composition of parent rock. Gases develop in magma through two different processes: first and second boiling. First boiling is defined as a decrease in confining pressure below the vapor pressure of the melt. Second boiling is defined as an increase in vapor pressure due to crystallization of the melt. In both cases, gas bubbles exsolve in the melt and aid the ascent of the magma towards the surface. As the magma ascends towards the surface, the temperature and confining pressure decrease. A decrease in temperature and confining pressure will allow an increase in crystallization and vapor pressure of the dissolved gas. Depending on the composition of the melt, this ascent can be either slow or fast. Felsic magmas are very viscous and travel to the surface of the Earth slower than mafic melts whose silica levels are lower. The amount of gas available to be exsolved and the concentrations of gases in the melt also control ascension of the magma. If the melt contains enough dissolved gas, the rate of exsolution will determine the magmas rate of ascension. Mafic melts contain low levels of dissolved gases whereas felsic melts contain high levels of dissolved gases. The rate of eruption for volcanoes of different compositions is not the controlling factor of gas emission into the atmosphere. The amount of gas delivered by an eruption is controlled by the origin of the magma, the crustal path the magma travels through, and several factors dealing with P-T-x at the Earth's surface. When felsic melts reach the surface of the Earth, they are generally very explosive (i.e. Mount St. Helens). Mafic melts generally flow over the surface of the Earth and form layers (i.e. Columbia River Basalt). Magma development under continental crust develops a different type of volcano than magmas that are generated under oceanic crust. Subduction zones produce volcanic island arcs (such as the Aleutian Islands, Alaska) and non-arc volcanism (such as Chile and California). Typically, arc volcanism is more explosive than non-arc volcanism due to the concentrations and amounts of gasses withheld in the magma underground. Fluid inclusion analysis from fluids trapped in minerals can show a path of volatile evolution in volcanic rocks. Isotopic analyses and interpretation of degassing scenarios are required in order to derive the origin of magmatic volatiles. When gas bubbles accumulate in a melt that is crystallizing, they create a vesicular texture. Vesicles are created by super cooling a melt while gases are present. Because the rock crystallized very quickly while in the Earth's atmosphere, it is possible to examine some igneous rocks for fluids trapped in vesicles. By examining many different inclusions, it is possible to detect crustal assimilation and depressurization that account for volatile release. Methods of characterizing igneous rocks The methods by which petrologists examine igneous rocks and synthetically produced materials are optical petrography, X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and many others. Methods such as optical petrography aid the researcher in understanding various textures of igneous rocks and, also, the mineralogical composition of the rock. XRD methods define the mineralogical constituents of the rock being tested; therefore, composition is only known based on the mineralogical composition discovered using this method. EPMA reveals textural features of the rock on the micron level. It also reveals a composition of the rock based on elemental abundance. For information about fluids trapped in an igneous rock, LA-ICP-MS could be used. This is accomplished by finding rocks with small pockets of fluid or vapor, acquiring the fluid or vapor, and testing the fluid or vapor for various elements and isotopes. Volcanic emissions and effects While most volcanoes emit some mixture of the same few gasses, each volcano's emissions contain different ratios of those gasses. Water vapour (H2O) is the predominant gas molecule produced, closely followed by carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), all of which can function as greenhouse gasses. A few unique volcanoes release more unusual compounds. For example, mud volcanoes in Romania belch out much more methane gas than H2O, CO2, or SO2 ‚àí95‚Äì98% methane (CH4), 1.5‚Äì2.3% CO2, and trace amounts of hydrogen and helium gas. [13] To measure volcanic gases directly, scientists commonly use flasks and funnels to capture samples directly from volcanic vents or fumaroles. The advantage of direct measurement is the ability to evaluate trace levels in the gaseous composition.Oppenheimer, C. Fischer, T., Scaillet, B., 2014, Volcanic Degassing: Process and Impact, In Treatise on Geochemistry (Second Edition), edited by H. D. Holland and K. K. Turekian, Elsevier, Oxford, pp. 111‚Äì179, Volcanic gasses can be indirectly measured using Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometry (TOMS), a satellite-remote sensing tool which evaluates SO2 clouds in the atmosphere.[11][14] TOMS‚Äô disadvantage is that its high detection limit can only measure large amounts of exuded gases, such as those emitted by an eruption with a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 3, on a logarithmic scale of 0 to 7. Sulfur ejection from volcanoes has a tremendous impact environmental impact, and is important to consider when studying the large-scale effects of volcanism. Volcanoes are the primary source of the sulfur (in the form of SO2) that ends up in the stratosphere, where it then reacts with OH radicals to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4). When the sulfuric acid molecules either spontaneously nucleate or condense on existing aerosols, they can grow large enough to form nuclei for raindrops and precipitate as acid rain. Rain containing elevated concentrations of SO2 kills vegetation, which then reduces the ability of the area's biomass to absorb CO2 from the air. It also creates a reducing environment in streams, lakes, and groundwater. [15] Because of its high reactivity with other molecules, increased sulfur concentrations in the atmosphere can lead to ozone depletion and start a positive warming feedback. Volcanoes with a felsic melt composition produce extremely explosive eruptions that can inject massive quantities of dust and aerosols high into the atmosphere. These particulate emissions are potent climate forcing agents, and can provoke a wide variety of responses including warming, cooling, and rainwater acidification. The climatic response depends on the altitude of the dust cloud as well as the size and composition of the dust. Some volcanic silicates cooled extremely quickly, created a glassy texture; their dark colour and reflective nature absorb some radiation and reflect the rest. Such volcanic material injected into the stratosphere blocks solar radiation, heating that layer of the atmosphere and cooling the area beneath it. Wind patterns can distribute the dust over vast geographic regions; for example, the 1815 eruption of Tambora in Indonesia produced so much dust that a cooling of 1 degree Celsius was noted as far away as New England, and lasted for several months. Europeans and Americans called its effect ‚Äúthe year without a summer‚Äù. Volcanic emissions contain trace amounts of heavy metals, which can affect the hydrosphere when they are injected into the lower reaches of the atmosphere. When large quantities of these emissions are concentrated into a small area they can damage ecosystems, negatively affect agriculture, and pollute water sources. Materials being emitted from volcanoes typically carry heavy metals in the trace level. When large quantities of these emissions are collected into a small area, the contamination effects become paramount. :The short-term (months-to-years) impacts of volcanism on the atmosphere, climate and environment are strongly controlled by location, timing, flux, magnitude and emission height of sulfur gases. Episodic explosive eruptions represent the principal perturbation to stratospheric aerosol (though the atmospheric effects of sulfur degassing associated with continental flood basalts might well be more profound). In the troposphere, the picture is less clear but a significant part of the global tropospheric sulfate burden may be volcanogenic. Sulfate aerosol influences the Earth's radiation budget by scattering and absorption of shortwave and long-wave radiation, and by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. When they are brought to the boundary layer and Earth's surface, clouds containing volcanic sulfur in both gaseous and aerosol phases can result in profound environmental and health impacts. Examples of the environmental and health impacts are agricultural loss due to acid rain and particulate shading, damage to ecosystems, and pollution in the hydrosphere. Intensity of a volcanic eruption is a variable controlling the altitude and effect of ejected material. Though larger eruptions occur less often than smaller eruptions, larger eruptions still deliver more particulate matter into the atmosphere. This year round behavior of emitted material yields mild effects on the atmosphere in comparison to larger eruptions. Over time, changes in the composition of smaller scale eruptions yields changes to atmospheric cycles and the global climate. Larger scale eruptions cause changes to the atmosphere immediately, which in turn leads to climatic changes in the immediate vicinity. The larger the volcanic expulsion, the higher the altitude achieved by the ejected silicate materials. Higher altitude injections are caused by larger intensity eruptions. Larger eruptions do not emit as much, on average, as smaller eruptions. This is related to the return period of the eruptions and the amount of ejected material per eruption. \\"The injection height of sulfur into the atmosphere represents another important determinant of climate impact. More intense eruptions, i.e., those with higher magma discharge rates, are more likely to loft the reactive sulfur gases into the stratosphere where they can generate climatically effective aerosol.\\" Eruption intensity of a volcano is not the only factor controlling the altitude of particles. The climate surrounding the volcano constrains the impact of the eruption. Models of eruptions that treat climatic variables as controls and hold eruption intensity constant predict particulate emissions, such as volcanic ash and other pyroclastic debris ejected into the atmosphere, in the tropics to reach higher altitudes than eruptions in arid or polar areas. Some of these climatic variables include humidity, aridity, winds, and atmospheric stability. The observation made by the model matches what is seen in nature: volcanoes in tropical climates have greater eruption heights than those in the poles. If there were a widening of the tropics, the number of volcanoes able to produce higher altitude emissions into the atmosphere would increase. Effects on the climate from the increase in airborne silicate material would be substantial because the height of these tropical eruptions will become more prominent with a widening of the tropics leading to more risks such as cooling, pollution, and aircraft disturbances. :The location of a volcano strongly influences the geographic distribution of atmospheric heating and the development of planetary waves that affect air circulation (especially in the northern hemisphere). Another relevant factor is that the height of the tropopause varies with latitude‚Äîat the tropics it is around 16‚Äì17 km above sea level but descends to 10‚Äì11 km at high latitudes. In general terms, an explosive eruption requires a greater intensity (magma discharge rate) to cross the tropopause in the tropics than at mid to polar latitudes. However, there are two factors that limit this effect. The first is that a high-latitude eruption will have a more limited effect than a low-latitude one because further from the tropics there is less solar energy to intercept. Secondly, atmospheric circulation works in a way to limit the effects of high latitude eruptions. A tropical eruption that pumps aerosol into the stratosphere results in localized heating. This increases the temperature difference in the middle atmosphere between the equator and high latitudes, and thereby enhances meridional air flows that spread aerosol into both hemispheres, promoting climate forcing at a worldwide scale. In contrast, volcanic aerosol injected into the stratosphere from high latitude volcanoes will tend to have the opposite effect on the temperature gradient, acting to stagnate meridional air flow. Very little, if any, of the stratospheric aerosol formed as a result of eruption of a high latitude volcano will reach the opposing hemisphere. Interaction between glaciation and volcanoes Volcanoes do not only affect the climate, they are affected by the climate. During times of glaciation, volcanic processes slow down. Glacial growth is promoted when summer heat is weak and winter cold is enhanced and when glaciers grow larger, they get heavier. This excess weight causes a reverse effect on the magma chamber's ability to produce a volcano. Thermodynamically, magma will dissolve gases more readily when the confining pressure on the magma is greater than the vapor pressure of the dissolved components. Glacial buildup typically occurs at high elevations, which are also the home to most continental volcanoes. Buildup of ice can cause a magma chamber to fail and crystallize underground. The cause of magma chamber failure occurs when the pressure of ice pressing down on Earth is greater than the pressure being exerted on the magma chamber from heat convection in the mantle. Ice core data from glaciers provides insight into past climate. \\"Oxygen isotopes and the calcium ion record are essential indicators of climatic variability, while peaks in sulfate ions (SO4) and in electrical conductivity of the ice indicate volcanic aerosol fallout.\\" As seen in ice cores, volcanic eruptions in the tropics and southern hemisphere are not recorded in the Greenland Ice sheets. Fallout from tropical eruptions can be seen at both poles though this takes nearly two years and consists of only sulfuric precipitation. \\"One of the striking revelations of the ice core record is the evidence for numerous great eruptions, which have not otherwise been recognized in tephra records. One caveat to the approach is that although the dating of the ice core by counting of seasonal layers is fairly robust, it is not fail-safe. The greater the depth from which the core is retrieved, the more likely it is to have suffered deformation Prevailing winds and atmospheric chemistry play a large role in moving volcanic volatiles from their source to their final locations at the surface or in the atmosphere.\\" Cretaceous climate During the Cretaceous, Earth experienced an unusual warming trend. Two explanations for this warming are attributed to tectonic and magmatic forces. One of the theories is a magmatic super plume inducing a high level of CO2 into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide levels in the Cretaceous could have been as high as 3.7 to 14.7 times their present amounts today causing an average 2.8 to 7.7 degrees Celsius. Tectonically, movements of the plates and a sea level fall could cause an additional 4.8 degrees Celsius globally. The combined effect between magmatic and tectonic processes could have placed the Cretaceous Earth 7.6 to 12.5 degrees Celsius higher than today. A second theory on the warm Cretaceous is the subduction of carbonate materials. By subducting carboniferous materials, a release of carbon dioxide would emit from volcanoes. During the Cretaceous, the Tethys Sea was rich in limestone deposits. By subducting this carboniferous platform, the resulting magma would have become more carbon dioxide rich. Because carbon dioxide dissolves into melts well, it would have remained dissolved until the confining pressure of the magma was low enough to de-gas and release massive quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere causing warming. Conclusion Volcanoes represent powerful images and forces on Earth's landscape. Generation of a volcano depends on its location and magmatic origin. Magmas will remain a melt until pressure and temperature allow crystallization and outgassing. During outgassing, the magma chamber will rise and meet Earth's surface causing a volcano. Depending on the composition of the melted material, this volcano could contain a variety of gases. Most of the gases emitted via volcanic eruption are greenhouse gases and cause atmospheric alterations. These atmospheric alterations then force the climate, both regionally and locally, to reach a new equilibrium with the new atmosphere. These changes can reflect as cooling, warming, higher precipitation rates and many others.

Although the SP-12 was quickly superseded by the more powerful SP-1200, the SP-12 is often regarded as the first commercially successful drum machine and sampler. History The E-mu SP-12 was the spiritual successor to E-mu's ‚ÄúDrumulator‚Äù and was originally going to be produced under the name Drumulator II, however shortly before the sampler went into production its name was changed to SP-12. The name SP-12 stands for sampling percussion at twelve bits, demonstrating the power of the sampler. The E-mu SP-12 is credited with helping usher in the era of digital sampling by being one of the first digital samplers in production, and allowing musicians to take digital sampling in a completely different direction. Originally the sole purpose of digital sampling was to allow producers to implement a desired sound into a keyboard so it would be able to be replicated within a song, however the SP-12 allowed the producer to focus primarily on the rhythm through the sampling and sequencing of the sounds of a drum something which was relatively rare at this point in time. The SP-12 would sample the desired drum sound, allowing you to augment it and then sequence the sampled drum sounds in any order that the producer would like to create the rhythmic backdrop for a song. Although this process was very innovative for the SP-12's true abilities were not E-mu's original intentions. DJ's of the 80's became famous for their ability to augment the sounds of old records to produce almost an entirely new composition through the use of a record player and this same principle was applied to the SP-12. People were beginning to replace the simple sampled drum sounds with the beats of their favorite drummers and even entire melodies, allowing their digital sampler to work just like the aforementioned set of turntables. These series of innovations left musicians with almost an endless amount of possibilities. Once E-mu systems realized the potential that the SP-12 had they quickly made the ‚ÄúTurbo‚Äù upgrade available which quadrupled the memory and doubled the sampling time. However the SP-12's existence was short lived for after only 2 years of production it was replaced by the far superior SP-1200. Today the SP-12 is more of an antique due to the superiority of the SP-1200, but it is still highly regarded as a collector's item.  Features  The E-Mu SP-12 today is classified as ‚ÄúLow-Fi‚Äù due to the fact that it samples at 12 bits at a rate of 26 kHz, however it came preloaded with 24 drum samples in ROM that consisted of a rim shot, 4 toms, electronic snare, snare, bass, 4 electronic toms, hi hats, crash, ride, claps, and cowbell along with 8 user sample positions. The original SP-12 had a maximum sampling time of 1.2 seconds while with the Turbo upgrade has a maximum sampling time of 5 seconds. Additionally the SP-12 has a 5000-note memory allowing it to store 100 songs, and 100 patterns and 400 songs, and 400 patterns with the turbo upgrade.  Trivia  *The SP-12 is almost identical in design to the E-mu Emulator II and many of the knobs and buttons are interchangeable. *Some of the original SP-12s have \\"Emulator SP12\\" written on them. * Original SP-12's were known to have \\"Paul is the Walrus\\" and \\"Paul is dead\\" written on the motherboard. * Later SP-12's Had \\"Loonie Tunes World Tour\\" written on the motherboards. * The Beastie Boys reference the SP-12 in their song \\"Putting Shame In Your Game\\" from their 1998 album Hello Nasty with the line, \\"Well I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12.\\" Rappin 4 Tay in Players Club (1994) says \\"I got a ho named reel-to-reel, she got a buddy named SP-12, now you know the deal.\\" Young MC raps in the song Album Filler (1991) \\"It's just me, a mic, and an SP-12.\\" *Big Grams, the collaboration between Big Boi and Phantogram references the SP-12 alongside other famous drum machines and sequencers such as the Roland TR-808 and Roland TR-909 in their song \\"Drum Machine\\" featuring Skrillex.

Dan gets promoted to the CID and gains confidence after successfully catching a thief. Dan later participates in his first drug raid operation in a pier, where Wah manages to arrest a number of criminals but the mastemind, Fei-ying, escapes as Dan was busy gambling with some colleagues and inadvertently kicks his superintendent \\"Potato Knives\\" into the water and is put on penalty. Ma blames himself for his son's failure, but Wah convinces him that Dan just needs an opportunity to prove himself. However, Dan foils another drug bust at a bowling alley when he interrupts Wah, who was fighting Fei-ying, allowing the latter to flee again, but manage to arrest Fei-ying's girlfriend, Sze. Dan bails Sze out after finding out she is the daughter of Ma's old friend, Auntie King, but Sze runs away after being harassed by patrons at her mother's bar. Sze later questions Fei-ying whether he is a drug trafficker, which he denies. Wah receives intel and leads his team to tail Fei-ying's client, No. 6, but Dan disregards Wah's instructions and attempts to arrest No. 6 himself, which backfires when No. 6 takes Dan's pistol, but Wah saves him just in time by killing No. 6.

Its current Gothic appearance dates to the early 15th century. It is so named because wood used to be piled next to it on the bank of the Rhine.Mainzer Zeitschrift 1939 p. 50 ; 'Wooden Tower' is a common misinterpretation of the name; the tower is made of stone. Like the Iron Tower, the Wood Tower was used as a watchtower and gate-tower and later as a gaol. It was badly damaged in World War II and accurately reconstructed in 1961 for the two-thousandth anniversary of the city. It currently houses various organisations and clubs. Historical background: the defences of Mainz Beginning in late Roman times, the city of Mainz (then Mogontiacum) was defended by a wall with watchtowers and city gates. The first wall was built shortly before the destruction of the limes in 259/260 CE. Not long after 350, in the course of the abandonment of the Roman camp, this wall was lowered and rubble (spolia) from earlier construction used to enlarge and strengthen it. After the Romans withdrew, it was improved at various times, particularly in the Merovingian and Carolingian periods, becoming what archaeologists studying the city have called the \\"Roman-Carolingian\\" wall. However, in 1160 the continuity of the city's defences was drastically interrupted. There was a longstanding dispute between the citizens of Mainz and their archbishop, Arnold of Selenhofen (and also with the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa); after the archbishop was murdered, the emperor imposed an imperial ban on the city. The city walls and towers were razed (although it is possible that on the inland side the destruction was only partial).Die mittelalterliche Stadtbefestigung von Mainz, Festung Mainz 2008, retrieved 3 May 2011 However, Mainz was an important political and strategic ally in the Hohenstaufens' struggle for supremacy in the German Empire against the Welfs, and so in circa 1190-1200 the city was granted permission to rebuild the defences. The predecessor of the Wood Tower, the so-called Neuturm (New Tower) was built in the second half of the 13th century when the previously independent settlement of Selenhofen was incorporated into the defences of the city. It replaced the Romanesque Wingert Gate; the first recorded mention of it is in 1366. Architectural style The Wood Gate as it stands today is a Gothic structure dating to the first half of the 15th century. Like the Iron Tower, the six-storey tower has walls of crushed stone articulated by square quoins and two dividing cornices, and is surmounted by a hipped roof, in this case very steep. In contrast to the Iron Tower, however, the Wood Tower is much more slenderly proportioned, which is typical of the 'verticality' of the Gothic style. The former city gate has a pointed archway, and a ribbed vault for the ceiling. (As a result of the embankment of the Rhine in modern times, the passageway through the gate is now approximately below street level.) Polygonal turrets with tall pointed roofs sprout from all four corners of the base of the roof, supported by stepped corbels connected by lancet arches. The tall windows have typically Gothic pointed-arch frames. Busts of couples appear above two windows on the first floor on the city side of the tower: a burgher and his wife and a king and queen. Pre-1880 view of the Wood Tower; in the foreground the former main station, demolished in 1884 Mediaeval and modern uses The tower formed part of the fortifications of the city and also as a gate in the rebuilt city wall. In the Middle Ages, wood rafted down the Rhine from South Germany was piled on the riverbank in front of the gates and the wood market was held here, which gave the tower and gate their name. Like other towers in the city walls, the Wood Tower also served as a gaol in the late mediaeval and early modern periods. Thus in 1793, after the reconquest of the previously French city of Mayence by Prussia, so-called 'Clubists', members of the Jacobin club who had organised the Republic of Mainz, were imprisoned in the Wood Tower. But its most prominent inmates were Johannes B√ºckler, known as 'Schinderhannes', and the members of his gang, who spent more than 15 months there before being guillotined under French law in November 1803 on what had been the grounds of the Electoral Palace of Favorite.Uwe Schultz, Grosse Prozesse: Recht und Gerechtigkeit in der Geschichte, Munich: Beck, 1996, pp. 234, 238 ReferencesSources * Carl Klein. \\"Das Holzturm in Mainz\\".

It does not block or filter sites like other child-oriented Internet control programs. Approximately 200 parents and teachers consult with the company to prescreen sites to permit children to access the Internet a safe, controlled manner. The browser provides a portal to 1.5 million pre-screened websites in 8,600 categories and millions of pages with age-appropriate content. The downloadable browser and search engine further divides webpages, videos and pictures by age category. KidZui launched the patented browser in spring 2008.

He was a former army commander of the Sultanate's Ilyas Shahi dynasty.KingListsFarEast Biography Andil was the army commander of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty and took power after killing the rebel Sultan, Barbak Shah II, in 1487. After claiming the throne, he styled himself as Saifuddin Firuz Shah. It is said that Andil was an eunuch. He is often considered as the real founder of the Habshi rule in Bengal as the previous Shahzada Barbak only ruled for a few months. This is reinforced in an inscription found in Garh Jaripa in Sreebardi, Sherpur, where he was ordering the construction of someone's tomb and referred to himself as Sultan al-Ahad (the first Sultan). The four corners of the person's tomb each bore the names of the Rashidun caliphs and the inscription sent blessings upon the Islamic prophet Muhammad, his daughter Fatimah and her two sons Hasan and Husayn. This inscription can now be found in the Indian Museum, Kolkata. Firuz Shah minted coins during his reign and mentions the historical town of Mahmudabad. He is described as a patron of architecture and calligraphy in Bengal. He orderd Majlis Sa'd to build a mosque in Maldah. On 18 January 1489, he ordered Mukhlis Khan to the construction of a ten-domed mosque in Goamatli, Maldah. In the same year, he also ordered Ulugh Ali Zafar Khan to construct a mosque in Kalna. It is also considered that the Bokainagar and Tajpur forts were established by Majlis Khan Humayun during his expedition to Kamarupa, under the orders of Firuz Shah. He also built the Katra mosque in Maldah and the inscription contains authentic Tughra calligraphy. His most famous architecture is the Firuz Minar. Named after himself, it is a large five-storeyed tower situated in Gauda. The construction started in 1485 before his reign, but was completed in 1489 to commemorates his victories in the battlefield. According to tradition, he threw the chief architect from the topmost storey as he was not satisfied with the tower's height and wanted it to be taller. Death His rule lasted two years until his death in 1489 where he was succeeded by his adopted son, Mahmud Shah II. Most historians consider that he died of natural causes while some such as Ghulam Husain Salim and Jadunath Sarkar say that he was also killed by one of the Abyssinian palace-guards.

It is preserved in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a historical record of events in Anglo-Saxon England which was kept from the late ninth to the mid-twelfth century. The poem records the Battle of Brunanburh, a battle fought in 937 between an English army and a combined army of Scots, Vikings, and Britons. The battle resulted in an English victory, celebrated by the poem in style and language like that of traditional Old English battle poetry. The poem is notable because of those traditional elements and has been praised for its authentic tone, but it is also remarkable for its fiercely nationalistic tone, which documents the development of a unified England ruled by the House of Wessex. Historical background The Battle of Brunanburh was a culmination of the conflict between King √Üthelstan and the northern kings.Stenton 342-43. After √Üthelstan had defeated the Vikings at York in 928, Constantine II, the Scottish King, recognised the threat posed by the House of Wessex to his own position, and began forging alliances with neighbouring kingdoms to attempt a pre-emptive strike against √Üthelstan. He married his daughter to Amla√≠b mac Gofraid (also called Olaf Guthfrithsson, and Anlaf in the poem), the Norse-Gael King of Dublin. Amla√≠b had a claim to the throne of Northumbria, from which √Üthelstan expelled his father in 927.Woolf 168-69. Thus, the invading army combined \\"Vikings, Scots, and Strathclyde Britons.\\"Swanton 321. On the English side, √Üthelstan was joined by his brother, the later King Edmund. In the ensuing battle, the combined forces of Wessex and Mercia won a decisive victory.Fee 162. The poem The poem is preserved in four of the nine surviving manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. In the Parker Chronicle, its verse lines are written out as poetry,Treharne, Old and Middle English 28. following common Anglo-Saxon scribal practice. The 73-line long poem is written in \\"indeterminate Saxon,\\" that is, the regular West-Saxon dialect in which most surviving Old English poetry is copied. It is referred to as a panegyric celebrating the victory of √Üthelstan and Edmund I.Carroll 116. The text begins by praising King √Üthelstan and his brother Edmund I for their victory. It mentions the fall of \\"Scots and seafarers\\" in a battle that lasted an entire day, while \\"the battlefield flowed / with dark blood.\\" \\"Norse seafarer[s]\\" and \\"weary Scot[s]\\" were killed by \\"West Saxons [who] / pursued those hateful people\\", killing them from behind with their swords; neither did \\"the Mercians...stint / hard handplay\\". \\"Five young kings\\" are killed in battle along with \\"seven / of Anlaf's earls\\". Amla√≠b mac Gofraid (\\"Anlaf\\") flees by boat, and Constantine flees to the north, leaving \\"his son / savaged by weapons on that field of slaughter, / a mere boy in battle.\\" The poem concludes by comparing the battle to those fought in earlier stages of English history: :Never, before this, :were more men in this island slain :by the sword's edge--as books and aged sages :confirm--since Angles and Saxons sailed here :from the east, sought the Britons over the wide seas, :since those warsmiths hammered the Welsh, :and earls, eager for glory, overran the land. Style and tone The style of the poem has been described as \\"sagalike in its sparse use of language combined with ample specific detail.\\" According to George Anderson, since the poem comes so late in the Old English period, it gives evidence of the continuing attraction of the \\"warrior tradition\\": it is \\"clear and convincing testimony to the vitality of the Old English battle-epic tradition; the authentic ring sounds out years after the Beowulf Poet, Caedmon, and Cynewulf have been laid to rest.\\"Anderson 91, 92. Donald Fry compares passages from Beowulf and Brunanburh (concerning the boarding of ships) and remarks on the \\"similar diction and imagery\\".Fry 65. According to Malcolm Godden, the language resembles that of the Old English Genesis A.Godden 210. The poem is not without its detractors: an early critic, Walter J. Sedgefield, in a 1904 study of the poems in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, said \\"even the longest and best written of their number, the Battle of Brunanburh, is but a simulacrum, a ghost of the older epos\\".Quoted in Opland 97. That the poem should not be treated as a historical text, and that panegyric was the appropriate genre, was argued by Alistair Campbell: \\"The poet's subjects are the praise of heroes and the glory of victory. When this is realised, the oft- repeated criticism, that he does not greatly add to our knowledge of the battle, falls to the ground. It was not his object to do so. He was not writing an epic or a 'ballad.' He was writing a panegyric.\\"Quoted in Opland 98. Townend agrees, and notes that praise-poems on contemporary men are completely missing from the Anglo-Saxon period until a cluster of four panegyrics including Brunanburh in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.Townend 349-50. Compared to \\"The Battle of Maldon\\", an Old English poem that commemorates a battle between English and Vikings half a century later, Brunanburh is notable for its nationalist overtones, whereas Maldon celebrates Christian over non- Christian values. Indeed, the poem is seen as celebrating a logical progression in the development of England as a unified nation ruled by the House of Wessex; the battle reports \\"the dawning of a sense of nationality, ....a crisis in which a nation is involved\\".Ashdown 120. In this respect, Brunanburh is closer to the Anglo-Saxon poem The Taking of the Five Boroughs, also found in the Chronicle under the year 942, celebrating King Edmund's recapture of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. But while the poet claims veracity, Michael Swanton notes, \\"it is ironic in view of his primarily historic concerns that he is in fact more successful than the Maldon-poet in transmitting the traditional poetic style.\\"Swanton 167. Peter Clemoes argues in Interactions of Thought and Language in Old English Poetry that Brunanburh, as opposed to Maldon, relies on \\"uncomplicated patriotic triumphalism\\". The poem does not treat \\"personal responsibility\\" as Maldon does,Clemoes 411. but leans on an expansive view of history which sees the battle, in line with the Chronicles view of contemporary history as the \\"epitome of Anglo-Saxon, especially West Saxon, history with antecedents in the history of Britain\\", as \\"straightforwardly traditional\\".Clemoes 420. According to Patrick Wormald, the poem builds on the \\"sense of ideological identity that the English had been given by Bede.\\"Wormald 15. Accompanying the combatants are the usual \\"beasts of battle\\" found in other Old English poems‚Äîthe wolf, the raven, and the eagle. The Battle of Brunanburh, however, seems to include a fourth animal, the gu√æhafoc (literally Goshawk), or \\"war-hawk,\\" in line 64. However, editors and scholars of the poem have suggested that graedigne gu√æhafoc, \\"greedy war- hawk\\", is actually a kenning for the hasu-padan, / earn √¶ftan hwit, the \\"dusky coated, white-tailed eagle\\" of lines 62b-63a.Herring 9-11. Editions, adaptations, and translations The poem is included in the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records. The now-accepted standard edition of the poem is the 1938 edition by Alistair Campbell. The Battle of Brunanburh: A Casebook, edited by Michael Livingston, was published by the University of Exeter Press in 2011; it includes two alternative translations of the poem and essays on the battle and the poem.Livingston, ed. The twelfth-century Anglo-Norman chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar likely used the account in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for his treatment of √Üthelstan in his L'Estoire des Engles.Treharne, \\"Romanticizing the Past\\" 5. English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson translated (or \\"modernized\\"Hawthorne 264.) the poem in 1880, publishing it as part of his Ballads and Other Poems (and his son Hallam Tennyson published a prose translation of the poem). In contrast to many other translations of poetry, Tennyson's is still praised as \\"a faithful, sensitive, even eloquent recreation of its source.\\"Kuczynski 415. The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges wrote a short poem, \\"Brunanburh 937 AD,\\" a translation of which was published in The New Yorker.Borges 42. In a 1968 lecture at Harvard University, Borges praised Tennyson's translation, stating that in some locutions Tennyson sounds \\"more Saxon than the original.\\"Borges 59. A translation by Burton Raffel is included in Alexandra Hennessey Olsen's anthology Poems and prose from the Old English.Olsen and Raffel 40-42.

It serves as a major transportation route for Winnipeg. The bridge connects Academy Road with Maryland Street and Sherbrook Street. The current structure is the third bridge to span this section of the river. All three bridges were called the Maryland Bridge. Nearby landmarks include Misericordia Health Centre, Cornish Library, and Shaare Zedek Synagogue.  History = Original bridge (1894-1921)  The first Maryland Bridge was constructed in 1894 and nicknamed the Boundary Bridge, because Maryland Street once served as Winnipeg's western boundary. In 1915, the city of Winnipeg proposed transforming the bridge into a war memorial though the bridge was decommissioned before this idea came to fruition. Street car service on the first Maryland Bridge was suspended in June 1920. The bridge previously serviced street car routes 35 and 37. Around the same time, concerns were raised of the safety of the bridge's infrastructure and a ban was put in place on heavy traffic and street cars crossing the bridge. The original Maryland Bridge was decommissioned in 1921 after the completion of construction on the second bridge.  Second bridge (1921-1969)  After a Census of Traffic was conducted on the original bridge because of increased traffic and safety concerns, construction began on the second Maryland Bridge in 1920, and was completed in 1921. In 1951, construction was completed on the Maryland Bridge Cut-Off, a project to cut down on congestion by allowing drivers to turn right off the bridge onto Wellington Crescent without having to wait for a green light. In 1923, D. L. Saberton committed suicide by jumping from the Maryland Bridge and was the second person to die jumping from the bridge that week. An unnamed man also committed suicide jumping from the bridge in 1925. The bridge was closed for demolition in 1969 upon the opening of the Twin Bridge's western span. The second bridge is memorialized by the Maryland Twin Bridge Monument, located south of the current Maryland Bridge. The monument consists of a corner post shaped as a cairn that was preserved from the second Maryland Bridge.  Current bridge (1969-present)  A view of the Assiniboine River looking southeast from the bridgeThe current iteration of the Maryland Bridge was opened to traffic in two stages. The west structure on 8 November 1969 and the east structure on 5 August 1970. It was financed by the provincial government and constructed by the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg. In 2013, the Maryland Bridge was the 13th busiest bridge, out of 15, in Winnipeg with an average of 25,400 cars driving over the bridge per day. The Maryland Bridge was part of the route of the first Manitoba Marathon in 1979, though it is no longer on the marathon route. Since 1995, the Maryland Bridge has been the site of the Misericordia Health Centre Foundation‚Äôs annual Angel Squad fundraiser. As part of the fundraiser, volunteers line the bridge in the early morning dressed as angels offering coffee to drivers in exchange for donations. In 2015, the Angel Squad beat the Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of angels. In 2007, Doug Prysiazniuk was killed while performing maintenance on the bridge. Prysiazniuk's death delayed bridge maintenance and was ultimately declared an accident. The space underneath the Maryland Bridge has regularly been a shelter for Winnipeg's homeless. In May 2019, police ordered those living beneath the bridge to leave. Homeless individuals later returned to the bridge despite police orders to dismantle camps. In October 2019, a fire broke out beneath the bridge, though it caused no structural damage to the bridge and left behind no injuries. In the spring of 2020, the city of Winnipeg began testing noise makers to deter homeless camps underneath the bridge. The project was discontinued in June after criticism from city councillors and citizens about the rights and dignity of the homeless population. Architecture=Original bridge The first bridge was made of steel truss. This iteration of the Maryland Bridge was described by the Winnipeg Free Press as having a \\"Renaissance character\\" with \\"classic mouldings and features\\". Second bridge alt= The second bridge was a concrete arch structure that included a coloured aggregate of red granite, crushed to pass through a screen, exposed by scrubbing with steel brushes, and cleaned by several washings of muriatic acid and water. Current bridge The current bridge consists of I-shaped AASHTO girders and twin, five-span continuous precast prestressed concrete structures. Renovations to the northbound span occurred in 2005. In 2006, the southbound span was renovated. The bridge has a protected bike lane that continues onto Sherbrooke Street.

It is threatened by recreational activities in its habitat, and is federally listed as a threatened species. Liatris helleri is a perennial herb which grows up to about half a meter (20 inches) in height from a spherical corm. The leaves are variable in shape, from linear to lance-shaped, and about 5 to 22 centimeters (2-8.8 inches) in length, with the largest ones located at the base and much smaller ones higher on the stem. The inflorescence is a spike-like array of numerous flower heads. The flower heads have purplish bell-shaped involucres containing 7‚Äì13(‚Äì17 lighter purple disc flowers but no ray flowers. Blooming occurs from July to September. The fruit is an achene with a pappus of varying lengths, but generally shorter than those of other Liatris.

Created in 1995 by Federal Law 24515, INADI is considered one of Argentina's National human rights institutions. Purpose Discrimination in Argentina is hard to see on the surface because the marginalized population is pratically none visible in society making up only .5-1.5% of the Argentina population. This is strategic. The government of Argentina has taken remarkable leaps in the direction erdcation of racial discrimination throughout the last decade. However, it is notable that this is not going at an acceptable pace This slow moving pace is to be contributed to the change in Argentina leadership in 1999 as well as Argentinas long time institutionalized racism. It is said that 97% of the Argentina population is white, although this statistic is hard to decipher because of the underwhelming amount of available information on indigenous and immigrant communities, despite the deferment of the census because of lack of funds in 2000, when the national census data has been collected in Argentina in the past there was use of the category of national origin rather than race in Argentina, leading to incorrectly counting Afro-Argentines and citizens indigenous descent.< The miscounting of the census leads to the opinion of many individuals that 97% of the population is white is an over exaggeration, however, it certainly depicts the view of the country: white. This is a change. That is what is important, the change in the racial diversity Argentina. This change is thought to be built by nineteenth century founders that made notable strides to make Argentina a white nation through several different policies aimed at eradicating ethnic minority populations, while concurrently supporting European immigration. The 1853 constitution is still predominantly referenced in politics today, and the predilection for European immigration is not hidden knowledge, it is not secret that Argentina favors white immigrants. Racial discrimination persists against indigenous peoples, immigrants, Afro-Argentines, mestizo Argentines, Jews and Arabs. The lack of census information provided by the government makes it very difficult to provide insight in indigenous peoples‚Äô representation and participation in governmental and political affairs, and society by enlarge. Indigenous peoples‚Äô do carry constitutional recognition and formal protection of their rights to bilingual education, ownership of ancestral lands, and guaranteed participation in resource management. However, indigenous peoples‚Äô do not get a say of their natural resources, they are taken over by Government further re-enforcing negative power dynamics between citizen and government. Moreover, indigenous peoples‚Äô are increasingly marginalized in society as their representation depletes, and the country increasingly does not count their human existence. Indigenous people, immigrants of color, must fight for conditions for basic survival, it is clear that they‚Äôre not wanted in Argentina society and the government has no place for them. What is important to get from this is, this just didn‚Äôt happen. The eradication of indigenous people / people of color is institutionalized, and purposeful. This can be elucidated by the countries significant contribution to xenophobia: dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries. Governmental officials have used the increasing crime rates in cities to defend the exiling, and spreading thin of indigenous people and immigrants, defending they are the main cause of the crime despite statistics provided by the government proving differently. The National Institute against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism of Argentina is an agency whose main goal is to effectively combat all forms of discrimination, xenophobia, and racism within Argentina nationally and institute new protections, as well as consoling individual concerned citizens and working on education projects. Organzations such as national institute against discrimination, xenophobia, and racism is a stepping stone towards global equitability. All aspects of discrimination should be considered, specifically gender. Women in Argentina have higher rates of illiteracy, less access to money, less access to representation in court, therefore, elucidating how women of none white descent are at higher risk of oppression in Argentina then men.  Recent activities  In partnership with civil society and other civil rights organizations in Argentina The national Institute against racism and xenophobia works towards resisting the oppressions of marginalized groups in Argentina including, but not limited to, indigenous peoples, immigrants, Afro-Argentines, mestizo Argentines, Jews and Arabs. The national institute of discrimination, racism, and xenophobia could receive griveances from individual peoples‚Äô or more generally the organzation puts most of their efforts forward through education campaigns including audio-visual materials, brouchers, and phamplets. This organization is an amazing resource offering accessibility to justice for thousands of citizens, simply providing representation and services either individual or large scale educational, these efforts makes real steps towards indigenous people receiving their proper representation in society. Structure INADI is led by a Board of Directors, chaired currently by Dr. Victoria Donda. The chair and vice-chair are appointed to their positions for four-year terms by the Cabinet from a list of three candidates selected by the Congress; four of the directors are representatives of Ministries of the Interior, Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship, Justice, Security and Human Rights and Education. The other three directors are representatives of NGOs who have extensive experience in the struggle for human rights. The Advisory Council, which assists the Board of Directors, has ten members representing NGOs and reflects the diversity of the groups most affected by discrimination.

His father was a diplomat. The rich family background contributed to Wang's talent and sensitivity towards classic Chinese culture. From puberty to about age 25, Wang led the life of a Dandy. He did not go to school. He loved playing cricket as well as breeding and training pigeons and eagles. His life changed dramatically at the age of 25 when his mother died. He dropped the reveler‚Äôs life and devoted himself to study and writing. His art collection was an inspiration for craftsmen and scientists worldwide. During the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976), his collection was seized by the Chinese authorities, though after the revolution the collection was returned to him. In 2003 it became part of the Chinese national heritage. Throughout his life, he remained an avid fan of pigeons. English works, such as Beijing Pigeon Whistles written in 1999, exuded this passion. When he won the Prince Claus Award in 2003 in Beijing, pigeons were released as a gesture to the winner. Career Wang began his career after the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945). During this time, he worked at the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City in Beijing and later became a member of the prestigious Central Research Institute of Culture & History. Later, he became a researcher for the State Administration of Cultural Heritage. During the 1980s, he made regular contributions to the newspaper China Daily. Through other channels, he published much about the investigation he conducted, as is found in the dozens of books he left behind. His publications are in some cases the only available information on specific topics. Prince Claus Fund (2003) jury Work Wang was internationally known for his extensive study of a wide range of cultural relics, artifacts, and manifestations, including: furniture, Chinese lacquer art, bamboo carvings, pigeon whistles, a large number of traditional crafts and music. His knowledge ranges from trivial matters to esoteric, from Chinese manuscripts and objects to intangible cultural affairs. Altogether, he published over forty books. The book Classic Chinese Furniture: Ming and Early Qing Dynasties are considered his most influential work. It is a meticulous, precise work that includes all of his studies he made of Chinese furniture.

In 2004 he worked with archeologist Eric Blind to capture the first photographs of the mural, keeping the 1796 reredos intact. He then projected digital images in a public display onto the interior dome of the Mission Dolores Basilica. On 14 April 2011 a recreated version of the mural was unveiled on San Francisco's Bartlett Street as part of the Mission Community Market. Since 2004 Wood has conducted a series of video projections at Coit Tower, mostly illuminating native San Francisco and California heritage. These were presented in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2009. While a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Wood carried out a project to re-create the famous mural Man at the Crossroads painted by Diego Rivera in 1933 for the Rockefeller Center and destroyed in early, after controversy about its supposedly anti-capitalist imagery. Also while a student at MIT he created a documentary about MIT's oldest graduate dormitory, Ashdown House.

It was formed as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force in the United Kingdom in June 1940 as the \\"72nd Battalion\\" to create the 25th Brigade, which eventually became part of the 7th Division. After the threat of invasion had passed, the battalion was transferred to the Middle East in early 1941, and after a period of garrison duty in the Western Desert, the battalion fought against the Vichy French in the invasion of Syria and Lebanon. Later, in early 1942, in response to Japan's entry to the war, the battalion was transferred back to Australia and after a period of re- organisation and training it was sent to New Guinea where it took part in the Kokoda Track campaign. Arriving at the height of the fighting, after the Japanese advance stalled it took part in the pursuit of Japanese forces to the northern coast, fighting around the beachheads at Buna‚ÄìGona. In 1943, after returning to Australia for six months to refit, the battalion was committed to the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign, and then the Ramu Valley‚ÄìFinisterre Range campaign. Returning to Australia in early 1944, a long period of inactivity followed before the 2/33rd undertook its last campaign in Borneo in the final months of the war. The battalion was disbanded in Brisbane in March 1946. History=Formation in the United Kingdom Raised on 27 June 1940, as part of the 25th Brigade, the battalion was initially designated the 72nd Battalion, as a continuation of the numbers assigned to the infantry battalions of the Australian Imperial Force, which had been raised during the First World War. One of three Australian infantry battalions established in the United Kingdom during the early months of the war ‚Äì the others being 2/31st and 2/32nd Battalions ‚Äì it was formed from surplus Australian infantry reinforcements and support corps personnel ‚Äì drawn from all Australian states, these personnel had originally been assigned to the 6th Division ‚Äì who were sent to bolster the garrison following the Fall of France when the threat of invasion loomed. Understrength and lacking support personnel and large amounts of specialist equipment, the battalion initially consisted of only three rifle companies, each consisting of three platoons. The companies were designated 'A' to 'C', while the platoons were numerically designated 1 through to 9. This was one rifle company short of the standard establishment of the time, and at the time the battalion had a strength of just over 460 personnel, well below its authorised strength of around 900. In addition, the battalion headquarters company, which consisted of six platoons ‚Äì signals, anti-aircraft, mortars, carrier, pioneer, and transport ‚Äì was also understrength, and lacked a large amount of specialist equipment at the outset. Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Rudolph Bierwirth, in September, the battalion was issued with a circular brown over red unit colour patch (UCP), with a border of grey to denote that the battalion was a 2nd AIF unit. However, the circumstances of the battalion's establishment overseas resulted in the situation of the battalion's personnel being issued two different UCPs. Personnel who were in the United Kingdom at the end of 1940 were issued with the brown over red UCP. However, this UCP was issued without reference to Army Headquarters in Australia, who issued battalion reinforcements in Australia with a UCP consisting of a black over green oval in a circle of grey: this was intended to link the battalion to the 33rd Battalion, which had served during the First World War. Upon arrival in the Middle East, though, these patches were replaced with the brown and red patches. In October, the unit moved from Tidworth to Colchester and around the same time it was redesignated as the 2/33rd Battalion, to bring it into line with the other battalions of the Second Australian Imperial Force. At Colchester, the Australians undertook a period of intensive training which was followed by defensive duties amidst the backdrop of the ongoing Battle of Britain, which took place in the skies overhead. During this time, the battalion was allocated the role of mobile reserve, assigned the task of counter-attacking around Harwich in the event of a German invasion; in this role they undertook further training operating with and against tanks, with British armoured vehicles and crews being assigned to the battalion during training exercises. Garrison duties in North Africa and fighting in Syria alt=Soldiers advance across rocky ground towards a stone wall and gate By the end of 1940, the threat of invasion had dissipated and the Australian troops that had been sent to the United Kingdom were transferred to the Middle East. Travelling by train from Colchester to Glasgow in January 1941, the main body of the battalion embarked upon the transport Nea Hellas and sailed via Freetown and Durban. They reached Egypt in early March 1941 where the 25th Brigade, was assigned to the 7th Division. Moving to a camp in Palestine, the battalion's fourth rifle company ‚Äì designated 'D' Company ‚Äì was taken on strength, having previously been formed at Beit Jirja in September 1940 from excess reinforcements from the 6th Division. At the time, the 7th Division was preparing to go to Greece, to follow in the wake of the 6th Division; however, the entry of the Afrika Korps into the fighting in the Western Desert and early German successes prompted their movement to the fortress at Mersa Metruh, to guard against a possible German advance into Egypt from Libya. The 2/33rd remained at Mersa Metruh, undertaking defensive duties, until May 1941, but did not see combat. After this, the 7th Division began to prepare for an invasion of Vichy French-held Syria and Lebanon. A short-lived campaign, from early June until mid-July, the 2/33rd took part in the fighting around Merdjayoun ‚Äì attacking Fort Khiam in the early stages of the campaign ‚Äì and Jezzine, fighting mainly in disparate company groups. Following the French capitulation, the battalion undertook garrison duties in Lebanon as part of the Allied occupation force established there to defend against a possible German invasion through Turkey; in September the battalion occupied a position around the port of Tripoli. They remained there until early 1942 when the Australian government requested the return of the 7th Division to Australia, following Japan's entry into the war. The battalion's role, and indeed that of the whole 7th Division, in the fighting against the Vichy French was largely censored at the time due to concerns about negative public opinion in Australia and the battalion's historian, William Crooks, notes that later this caused some friction between 7th Division personnel and those from the 6th and 9th Divisions, and a general lack of public awareness of what they had done. Casualties sustained by the battalion in Syria and Lebanon numbered 21 dead, 84 wounded and 26 captured. Fighting against the Japanese in New Guinea Embarking on the Mt Vernon in Port Tewfik, the battalion sailed from Egypt in early February and arrived in Adelaide, South Australia, in mid-March. After this, the battalion camped at Woodside, in the Adelaide Hills, where a period of re-conditioning and exercises followed until mid-April when the majority of its personnel were sent on home leave. At the end of the month, those that remained undertook a five-day train journey to Casino, New South Wales. Limited training was undertaken until mid-May, around which time orders were received for another move, this time to Caboolture, Queensland. By the end of the month, the battalion returned to almost full strength when the final leave draft returned. At the time, the strategic situation in the Pacific was in the balance; the Japanese were advancing south and due to concerns about a possible Japanese invasion, the 25th Brigade was tasked with defending the coastal area north of Brisbane. In late August 1942, the 2/33rd deployed to New Guinea, where the Kokoda Track campaign was reaching its climax as the Japanese advanced on Port Moresby. Embarking on the Katoomba in late August, they landed at Port Moresby on 9 September. Four days later the battalion was thrown into battle against the Japanese around Ioribaiwa, leading the 25th Brigade forward. As the Japanese advance continued, the Australians withdrew back to Imita Ridge. As the 25th Brigade withdrew, the 2/33rd formed a rearguard, covering the withdrawal. After completing the movement rearwards, the battalion subsequently assumed a position in depth on the right. The Japanese then began to withdraw, having reached the limits of their supply line, and the Australians pursued them back to the beachheads on the northern coast where the Japanese had originally landed in July. Throughout October and November, the battalion fought significant engagements at Myola and Gorari, before being thrown into further fighting around Gona in late November and early December. Casualties were heavy, and by the time the Japanese beachhead had been destroyed, the battalion was withdrawn to Port Moresby, the battalion had been reduced to only two companies; early in January 1943, the main body of 2/33rd returned to Australia upon the transports Both and Duntroon. The rear detail followed in the middle of the month aboard the Taroona. Total casualties sustained by the 2/33rd during this period had included 46 dead and 121 wounded. alt=Soldiers march across a makeshift river crossing in the jungle Concentrating at Ravenshoe, in Queensland, in the early months of 1943 the 2/33rd was reorganised as part of the 7th Division's conversion to the jungle divisional establishment. As a part of this, the battalion's establishment was dropped to just over 800 men and it lost its carrier platoon, receiving in its place a machine gun platoon equipped with four Vickers machine guns. In addition, the anti-aircraft platoon was re-roled as a tank-attack platoon and the transport platoon was reduced to a third, with its complement of 74 vehicles and 14 motorcycles being replaced by 25 jeeps. Following this, an intense period of training was undertaken as the battalion received a batch of around 300 reinforcements to replace its losses in New Guinea; by July it was ready to deploy once again and subsequently returned to New Guinea to join the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign. Throughout the final weeks of July, the battalion was transported to Port Moresby aboard three transports: Canberra, Duntroon and Katoomba. Establishing a camp at \\"Pom-Pom\\" east of Port Moresby, the battalion spent the following month preparing for an airlift into Nadzab, in support of US paratroopers. On 7 September 1943, while the battalion's personnel waited to fly out to Nadzab from Jackson's Airfield, near Port Moresby, a heavily laden US B-24 Liberator bomber crashed into trucks carrying the battalion, killing 60 and injuring a further 92; this represented a third of the battalion's casualties for the entire war. The following day, the 2/33rd was flown into Nadzab and they subsequently took part in the capture of Lae; at the end of the month, they were transported by air to Kaipit from where they were committed to the advance up the Ramu Valley into the Finnesterre Range during which they were involved mainly in small unit actions and patrols. The battalion's casualties in New Guinea during the campaigns of 1943‚Äì1944 numbered 84 dead and 70 wounded. Borneo: Final campaign and disbandment In early February 1944, the battalion was withdrawn back to Australia, returning aboard the Kanimbla. A long period of training and rebuilding followed, as US forces assumed the primary responsibility for the fighting against the Japanese in the Pacific. Inter-Allied politics, coupled with a rapidly evolving strategic situation resulted in a period of operational uncertainty for the Australian Army during which there was significant ambiguity about their future employment against the Japanese. As a result, it was not until close to the end of the war that the 2/33rd went into action again. In June 1945, the battalion embarked for Morotai Island, from where they subsequently took part in the re-capture of Balikpapan the following month. During the landing, the 2/33rd formed part of the floating reserve, but after the early stages of the assault it came ashore on the second day along with the 25th Brigade's two other infantry battalions, and they assumed control of the central part of the Australian beachhead. The following day, the 25th Brigade began to advance inland up the main north-eastern axis, which the Australians dubbed the \\"Milford Highway\\". The 2/33rd took up position on the right hand side of the brigade's front, coming up against stiff Japanese resistance as it advanced around Chilton Road, but this was overcome with machine gun and artillery support, after which the advance inland continued. A series of minor actions followed as the Australians continued their advance up the Milford Highway. After a month of fighting, the island was largely secured and following the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945, the Japanese sued for peace and hostilities came to an end. During the fighting in Borneo the 2/33rd had lost 25 dead and 57 wounded. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Australians remained on Borneo as an occupation force, while the Army was slowly demobilised. During this time the battalion was steadily reduced as personnel were repatriated to Australia for discharge, or were transferred to other units for further service, including providing personnel to the 34th Brigade, which was raised for occupation duties in Japan. In February 1946, the remaining cadre returned to Australia and the following month it was disbanded in Brisbane. During the war, 3,065 men served in the battalion, while a further 588 were posted to it following the war; of these, the 2/33rd lost 200 men killed and 363 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: two Distinguished Service Orders, seven Military Crosses, 11 Military Medals and 27 Mentions in Despatches. Battle honours For its service during the war, the 2/33rd was awarded the following battle and theatre honours: * North Africa; Syria 1941; Syrian Frontier; Merjayun; South-West Pacific 1942‚Äì1945; Kokoda Trail; Ioribaiwa; Eora Creek‚ÄìTempleton's Crossing II; Oivi‚ÄìGorari; Buna‚ÄìGona; Gona; Lae‚ÄìNadzab; Lae Road; Liberation of Australian New Guinea; Ramu Valley; Shaggy Ridge; Borneo 1945; Balikpapan; Milford Highway.

Raised in May 1940 as part of the 7th Division from volunteers from the state of South Australia, the battalion was assigned to the 21st Brigade. After completing training in Australia, the 2/27th deployed to the Middle East in November 1940, and in early 1941 undertook defensive duties in the Western Desert. The battalion's first combat experience came against the Vichy French during the short Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign during which it fought major engagements around Sidon and Damour. At the conclusion of the fighting in Syria, the battalion remained in the area as part of the Allied occupation force until early 1942 when it was returned to Australia to fight against the Japanese. From September 1942 until early 1943, the 2/27th took part in the Kokoda Track campaign and then the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona, before being withdrawn to Australia where it was rebuilt. In August 1943, the 2/27th returned to New Guinea and subsequently took part in the Finisterre Range campaign, leading the 21st Brigade's effort to capture Shaggy Ridge, remaining there until early 1944. The battalion's final campaign of the war came in the final months of the conflict during the Borneo campaign when it took part in the landing at Balikpapan. Following a short stint on occupation duties in the Celebes Islands after the end of the war, the battalion was disbanded in Australia in early 1946. History=Formation The 2/27th Battalion was raised as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) at Woodside Barracks, South Australia, on 7 May 1940. Along with the 2/14th and 2/16th Battalions, it was attached to the 21st Brigade, which formed part of the 7th Division, the second infantry division raised as part of the 2nd AIF.. With an authorised strength of 910 men of all ranks, it was organised into four rifle companies designated 'A' to 'D' with a battalion headquarters, regimental aid post, and a headquarters company consisting of specialist signals, anti-aircraft, mortar, carrier, pioneer and administrative platoons.. The battalion's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Murray Moten, a former Militia officer who had previously commanded the South Australian- based 48th Battalion.. The colours chosen for the battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 27th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were brown over light blue, in a diamond shape, although a border of gray in an oval shape was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart. After undertaking rudimentary training, in October 1940 the battalion was moved by train to Melbourne, where it embarked for overseas aboard the transport Mauretania.. Sailing via India, the 2/27th briefly made camp at Deolali, outside of Bombay for a week before embarking on the Takliwa for the rest of the journey to the Middle East.. The battalion arrived in Egypt on 24 November, making landfall at Kantara moving to Julius Camp in Palestine for further training.. Syria and Lebanon left After completing its training in Palestine, the 2/27th Battalion was moved to Egypt‚ÄìLibya border in April 1941. There, along with the rest of the 21st Brigade, they undertook defensive duties, occupying defensive positions around Mersa Matruh and Maaten Bagush in anticipation of the German and Italian advance. The battalion remained there until April, and although they were not directly involved in ground combat, they experienced their first attacks by German aircraft. They were subsequently returned to Palestine ahead of the battalion's first combat assignment, the invasion of Syria and Lebanon, which began in early June. During the subsequent fighting against Vichy forces, the 2/27th took part in the drive up the Lebanon coast, taking part in several engagements including fighting around Adloun on 11 June and Miye-ou- miye on 13‚Äì14 June as part of the capture of Sidon, which fell on 15 June.. The following month, the battalion also took part in the Battle of Damour. After five weeks of fighting an armistice was signed on 12 July.. Following the surrender of Vichy forces, the unit undertook garrison duties around Hammana, near Beirut, and Bakhaoun in the Tripoli sector, as part of the Allied occupation force, remaining there until January 1942.. At the end of the campaign, Moten was decorated and promoted; he was replaced as commander of the 2/27th by Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Cooper.. Following Japan's entry into the war in December 1941, the Australian government began pressing for some of the AIF forces in the Middle East to be returned to Australia, to help defend against the Japanese advance in the Pacific. In late January 1942, the 2/27th embarked from Egypt aboard the Ile de France, sailing once again via Bombay. There, the battalion was transferred to the City of London. During the voyage, there were plans to divert the convoy to Java, to reinforce the Australian and Dutch forces there against the Japanese, but the deteriorating situation there resulted in the convoy being re-routed. After a port-call in Colombo, the convoy reached Fremantle on 15 March for a brief shore leave before proceeding on to Port Adelaide, where the 2/27th disembarked.. Following a brief period of leave, the 21st Brigade concentrated in Queensland ‚Äì the 2/27th being based around Caloundra ‚Äì where, over the course of several months, they were prepared for deployment to the Pacific theatre.. New Guinea right In mid-August 1942, the 2/27th battalion was deployed to New Guinea, where the Japanese were threatening to capture Port Moresby, following a landing around Buna in July. After initially being kept back at Port Moresby in reserve as the Battle of Milne Bay was fought,. in early September 1942, at the height of the Kokoda Track campaign, the 2/27th moved north towards the Kokoda Track, joining Brigadier Arnold Potts' Maroubra Force.. Following delaying actions around Isurava, the Australians had been forced to withdraw further south along the track, and in an effort to stem the Japanese advance, on 6 September the 2/27th, as the freshest of the 21st Brigade's units, was committed to the fighting, taking up a defensive position at Mission Ridge, on the northern face of Brigade Hill. For the next two days, the battalion held off a frontal attack by a Japanese battalion, but as a result of flanking moves a withdrawal to Menari was ordered and the 2/14th and 2/16th Battalions withdrew, leaving their wounded with the 2/27th, who formed the brigade rearguard. After 'B' and 'C' Companies launched a brief, but successful local counterattack, the 2/27th was also able to break contact.. With the Japanese pressing hard, Potts ordered a further withdrawal from Menari before the 2/27th arrived, effectively cutting it off from the rest of the brigade. For the next two weeks, the 2/27th fought through the jungle, carrying their wounded with them, to regain contact with supporting units, eventually linking up with them at Jawarere on 22 September.. After this, the battalion, having suffered heavily from disease, was briefly withdrawn back to Port Moresby for rest at the end of the month. In October, the 2/27th provided one company to the ad hoc Chaforce, providing work parties to bring up supplies and evacuate the wounded as the Australians advanced towards the Kumusi River, after the Japanese were pushed back from Kokoda. Also in October, the battalion provided a company to Jawforce, carrying out patrols between Jawarere and Nigabaifa, while a platoon was dispatched to Eilogo to form Eilogo Force. Both of these elements returned to the main body of the 2/27th in mid-November, although Chaforce remained detached at that time.. In late November, the 2/27th was recommitted to the fighting as the Japanese withdrew towards their beachheads in the north. Even though it remained at only half strength, the battalion was moved by air from Port Moresby to Popondetta, and from there they joined the fighting around Gona, where the company that had been attached to Chaforce was also fighting.. The fighting that followed severely depleted the battalion due to heavy casualties and tropical diseases and, as a result, by mid-January 1943 its fighting strength had fallen to just 70 men, and it was subsequently relieved by the 36th Battalion around the mouth of the Amboga River. It was then withdrawn back to Popondetta and then Dobodura for air transport back to Port Moresby. In Port Moresby, after a week of rest, the 2/27th embarked upon the transport Jason Lee for the voyage back to Australia, landing at Cairns in late January, before returning to the Atherton Tablelands.. left In March 1943, Lieutenant Colonel John Bishop, a former staff officer,. took over as commanding officer, replacing Cooper who had been wounded at Gona in late 1942.. The battalion was rebuilt on the Atherton Tablelands as part of preparations to make it ready for further operations in New Guinea.. A period of rest and reorganisation followed, during which a batch of over 100 reinforcements was received from the 16th Motor Regiment.. As part of the battalion's reorganisation under the Jungle divisional establishment, its authorised strength fell to 803 men many of its vehicles and heavy equipment were returned as the Australian Army was restructured to focus upon operations in the Pacific. In August 1943, the 2/27th returned to New Guinea and subsequently took part in the Ramu Valley‚ÄìFinisterre Range campaign, flying into Kaiapit before beginning its advance towards Dumpu in September, which was undertaken following the capture of Lae and the Huon Peninsula campaign as part of efforts to advance towards Madang.. Advancing through the Ramu Valley towards the range, the 2/27th saw heavy fighting as the 21st Brigade led the 7th Division's efforts to capture the high ground around Shaggy Ridge. In mid- October, the 2/27th helped turn back a heavy Japanese counterattack around John's Knoll and Trevor's Ridge, before the 21st Brigade was relieved... Halfway through the campaign, in mid-November, Bishop was replaced as battalion commander by Lieutenant Colonel Keith Picken, and returned to a staff position. Picken subsequently led the battalion throughout the remainder of the war.. By early January 1944, the 2/27th was withdrawn from the fighting and in March 1944 it returned to Australia. Borneo and disbandment A further period of training and reorganisation followed before the 2/27th returned to operations late in the war when it was dispatched to Borneo. As part of the Operation Oboe landings, the battalion took part in an amphibious landing at Balikpapan on 1 July 1945. Coming ashore at Klandasan, the 2/27th formed the spearhead of the 21st Brigade's assault, capturing several key features overlooking the beachhead before follow-on forces passed through them and carried forward the attack. On 3 July, the battalion began patrol operations from its base around Sepinggang, to provide flank protection for the 2/14th Battalion as the 21st Brigade advanced to Manggar airfield. Throughout the campaign, the battalion's casualties were light, and hostilities were short-lived as the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki took place only weeks after; after the initial landing, the battalion's main involvement in the campaign consisted largely of sub-unit patrol operations along the coast from Manggar. With the war over, the 2/27th was sent, along with the rest of the 21st Brigade, to Makassar in the Celebes Islands as part of the occupation force. They remained there until the beginning of February 1946, when they were relieved by Indian troops.. After five years of war, the 2/27th battalion returned to Australia in early February 1946 aboard the transport Winchester Victory, which took them to Brisbane, Queensland. The battalion was disbanded in Chermside on 18 March 1946, as part of the demobilisation process. During its war service, a total of 2,769 men served with the battalion. of whom 268 were killed in action, while a further 607 were wounded. The following decorations were awarded to members of the 2/27th Battalion: two Distinguished Service Orders, three Military Crosses and one Bar, one Distinguished Conduct Medal, 17 Military Medals, and 49 Mentions in Despatches. Battle honours The 2/27th Battalion was awarded the following battle honours: *North Africa, Syria 1941, The Litani, Sidon, Adlun, Damour, South-West Pacific 1942‚Äì45, Kokoda Trail, Efogi‚ÄìMenari, Buna‚ÄìGona, Gona, Liberation of Australian New Guinea, Ramu Valley, Shaggy Ridge, Borneo 1945, Balikpapan.

The Spreeta device was developed by Texas Instruments, Inc. in the 1990s. Device design incorporates a light-emitting diode (LED) illuminating a thin metal film (usually gold) in the Kretchmann geometry (needed to excite surface plasmons). The reflected light is detected by a photodiode linear array (which translates angle of reflection to pixel position) and the resonance (a dip in the reflectivity at a specific angle of incidence) denotes the refractive index on the outer surface of the metal film. Applications include real-time measurement of binding of antigens to antibodies attached to the sensor surface, monitoring changes in oil quality, and measuring sugar content in drinks (Brix level). The term \\"Spreeta\\" is an anglic derivative of SPR-ITA which combines SPR (for Surface Plasmon Resonance) with \\"ita\\" (a Spanish suffix meaning \\"small\\").

Morphology Omocestus viridulus tend to be green all over, but some may have brown coloration on the sides. In Scandinavia, they tend to have either a green or light brown colour. The males do not have any red coloring on the abdomen and possess a noticeably long ovipositor, characteristics that help distinguish it from the similar species O. rufipes and O. haemorrhoidalis. The eyes of this species may be either brown or yellow. The typical body length is . They possess a strongly darkened region of the hind wing. Distribution and habitat Omocestus viridulus typically lives in moderately wet regions around Europe except north of the Arctic Circle, and it is distributed widely over Britain. Its range extends east as far as Siberia and Mongolia. Their preferred habitat consists of areas with longer grass. Diet and life cycle This species prefers to feed on the more common, abundant grass species and this may promote greater diversity of vegetation. O. viridulus feeds on grass from the genera Dactylis, Agrostis, Anthoxanthum, Lolium and Holcus. The life cycle begins with the females laying their clutch of eggs in the top layer of soil or near the root of the grass stalks. The young are called nymphs and emerge the next April. These nymphs resemble miniature versions of the adults with immature wings. After about a month of moulting their exoskeleton several times, they mature into adults with working wings. There is one generation of O. viridulus a year, and they are usually seen between the months of April and October. Reproduction Compared to other grasshopper species, the reproductive fitness of O. viridulus tends to be less affected by temperature changes. It has been found that for female O. viridulus, the number of eggs in each pod, and the mass of eggs were not adversely affected by temperature. In the wild, the males find the females quickly and mate, and the females refrain from singing until they lay at least one cluster of eggs. If the male fails to mate with a female, he will sing before trying again. Song Songs are produced by a process called stridulation in which the hind leg and wing are rubbed together. Calling songs are used by these grasshoppers in order to attract and find a mate. Although most of the singing is done by the males, females that are ready to mate may also sing in response. The females also use stridulation to produce their songs. The male normally sings only one calling song in one place before moving on to another spot to try calling again. However, occasionally they may call more than once in the same spot. Ticking is another sound that is produced when the male flicks the hind part of its back leg against one of its fore wings (the process is called a tibial flick). In the courtship process, the frequency of these tibial flicks does not follow a regular pattern and is highly variable between 5 and 15 ticks repeated roughly every 1 to 2 seconds. Geographical variation is also present in the mating song of this species. In Spain, where this grasshopper exists as the subspecies O. viridulus kaesteneri, the song tends to be shorter than in other regions. When singing to a female, one of the hind legs is moved at a much wider angle than the other and this generates most of the sound. The songs are characterised by crescendos that make up a significant part of the song. The songs start quietly and increase until it reaches the greatest intensity, and then dies out. The males usually follow up their calling songs with a succession of loud syllables and then try to mate with the female. When the male is calling to a female, there is a greater amplitude of movement for the hind leg facing the female. Males call when a female is close by, and these songs last about 45‚Äì60 seconds each with breaks of 10‚Äì15 s in between. Various studies have been performed on the songs of O. viridulus. Heinrich et al. demonstrated that singing in both males and females can be induced with the injection of acetylcholine. A study by Eir√≠ksson revealed that the males of this species can use their songs most efficiently based on how frequently they sing and how they time their songs, as it is important that the males minimize the overlap of their songs with the females' song so that they can find each other. If the female sings at the same time as the male, the male might not hear the female's song. The males try to minimize this overlap in songs because he must be able to hear the female‚Äôs song in order to locate her.

Muktangan executes their programmes with support from other partners like Maharashtra Dyslexia Association, Ummeed Child Development and Remedial Centre, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Nirmala Niketan, Teach for India Programme and Absolute Return for Kids' School Leaders India Programme. Educational philosophy To evolve sustainable, replicable inclusive models of quality child-centred teacher education and school programs in partnership with marginalised communities and to advocate them to the larger system. An inclusive, empowered world in which all live in harmony with freedom of expression, respect and integrity. History Muktangan began in March 2003 with the training of 7 women from low income communities in G South Ward (Worli and Lower Parel areas) of Mumbai in a well researched child-initiated pre-school pedagogy. No space being available in the local area, six classrooms were rented in the local Globe Mill Passage Municipal School. Thus began the initial relationship of Muktangan with the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) providing them the opportunity to witness and understand the Muktangan curriculum and child-centered methodology in the preschool. Within the year, responding to the demand by parents and the local community for continuing the methodology beyond preschool, the MCGM who were already familiar with Muktangan's effectiveness in the preschool, offered as a pilot project their English medium school in the Globe Mill Passage Municipal School to be run by Muktangan on its unique methodology. A public-private partnership was set up between Muktangan and the MCGM who have been enthusiastic, cooperative partners from that day onwards. Subsequently, having seen the success of the model, the MCGM requested us to set up six additional English medium schools in G South Ward of Mumbai. The initial 3-month pre-service training programme for local women had by now become a full one year intensive course followed by an initial year of residency. Under MOUs between the MCGM and Muktangan, all 7 schools are adding a higher standard each year until they all reach Std X for the SSC Board Exams ‚Äì the first school in 2013 and the other 6 in 2017. The original school will be going into Standard 8 in June 2011 and the remaining 6 schools into Standard 4, covering 2000 children with an additional 300 children being added every year thereafter.

Accessed June 19, 2011. \\"Musician Matt Duke is a 20-year-old native of Mount Laurel who is recording his first acoustic album for release in March.\\" He released an independent album, Winter Child, through the student-run MAD Dragon Records at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Later he signed to the major label Rykodisc and has since released multiple albums: two full-length albums: Kingdom Underground and One Day Die, and two EPs. Early life Duke was born in Reston, Virginia to Thomas, a contracts negotiator, and Angela, a teacher. Matt Duke is of Irish, Italian and Polish descent, and had a religious Roman Catholic upbringing. He lived in Reston until the age of 5, when his family moved to Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey, where he lived until adulthood. Growing up in South Jersey he attended the Our Lady of Good Counsel parish grade school until 8th grade, and then Saint Joseph's Preparatory School in Philadelphia for high school. As a child and teenager, he performed in local theatre productions through school and community programs. In his late teens and early 20s he worked a variety of jobs including: sandwich-maker, framer, gardener and construction worker. Career=Early career As a child Duke played the piano at the behest of his mother. He then quit playing and picked up guitar at the age of 13. The guitar was his mother's '70s Penco and she left him to teach himself, after he had quit playing piano she said she would not pay for lessons lest he quit again. The next three years Duke spent learning to play the guitar, from internet tablature and playing along with the radio to bands like Alice in Chains and Nirvana. By the time that he was sixteen he started to play live shows at a local coffeehouse in Collingswood, New Jersey, \\"The Living Room\\", doing a mixture of original material and cover songs. He performed at open-mic nights at The Point in Bryn Mawr, PA. For his 18th birthday his family gave him a present of recording time to record the songs he had written for posterity. Duke and a friend recorded six songs in two hours at his church, and CD copies ended up being passed around to friends and family.  MAD Dragon: XYX & Winter Child One of the CDs ended up in the hands of his friend who was a student at the newly formed MAD Dragon Records, which is a student-run record label operating out of Drexel University. The CD was played in an A&R; class at MAD Dragon, headed by Marcy Rauer Wagman (then a professor at Drexel, and the creator and head of MAD Dragon's family of entities), which then led to MAD Dragon Records asking Duke to sign a one-year promotional deal with them, with the intent of using students for all aspects of the process like recording and promotion. Duke, Julia Othmer and Trisha O'Keefe were asked to contribute songs to a compilation record, which became XYX. XYX was the first CD released by MAD Dragon Records and featured four songs from each artist, with O'Keefe and Duke using the Drexel recording studios in the fall of 2004. Jim Klein, a professor at Drexel and part of the MAD Dragon program, handled production for Duke's part of the album. Duke, O'Keefe and Othmer supported the album with a small tour around Northeast which was booked by the students through the student-run Drako Booking Agency, part of the MAD Dragon enterprise. After the tour was over, MAD Dragon wanted Duke to sign a recording artist deal to produce a full-length album. Winter Child, the next album released by Duke, was recorded on-and-off over the next year. \\"Winter Child\\" was primarily recorded in a New York studio with Stewart Lerman and Steuart Smith. Jim Klein contributed several tracks as well. During the making of Winter Child, Marcy Rauer Wagman arranged a meeting between MAD Dragon and Ryko Distribution; as a result, Ryko Distribution became interested in distributing content from MAD Dragon Records and other student-run record labels. This deal lead to Ryko Distribution distributing the Winter Child record. A student-made music video for the song \\"Oysters\\" was also made and the song was treated as the single from the album. Matt Duke performing at the City Winery in NYC on April 28, 2011  Kingdom Underground, Acoustic Kingdom Underground and TFDI  After the release and tour to promote the album, Ryko took interest in Duke and asked him to sign a record deal with them, to produce the full-length album that would become Kingdom Underground. Using a demo of the song \\"I've Got Atrophy on the Brain\\" that was recorded with students at Drexel, Ryko got the interest of producer Marshall Altman and Altman agreed to meet Duke in Los Angeles to see how the two would work. After the meeting in Los Angeles, Duke and Altman agreed to work, leaving Duke to head back to Philadelphia to prepare and write songs for the release. With the songs written, Duke traveled to Burbank, California to record with Altman and finished the production of the album in just four weeks. Kingdom Underground was released later that year on September 23, 2008. Months after the tour and release of Kingdom Underground Ryko asked Duke to record a supplemental EP of acoustic tracks to the Kingdom Underground album, called Acoustic Kingdom Underground. This was to match the feel and sound of Duke's live shows, as he was touring solo without a band. The producer of that EP, Jason Finkel, would later become the producer of Duke's next full-length release. After recording Acoustic Kingdom Underground, Duke was invited to be the opener for a co- headlining tour featuring Jay Nash and Tony Lucca. During this time the three became friends and recorded an impromptu collection of songs during the tour at a studio in Evanston, Illinois, calling the collaboration TFDI, they released these songs as an EP with the same name.  One Day Die  Following the tour with Jay Nash and Tony Lucca, Duke returned home and began to focus on his next full-length album, One Day Die. Duke asked Finkel, who had produced his acoustic EP, to be the producer for this album and the two began work in September 2009 on material. The album was then pushed back indefinitely, when, on November 1 of that same year, Duke suffered a hand injury in an accident, breaking two bones near his pinkie on his right hand. Duke was unable to play the guitar after the surgery and during his rehabilitation, but he worked on writing during his downtime, and was successfully able to play guitar again a few months later. Well enough to play, production for the album began again, and the direction of the album changed as a result of the accident. The album was released on March 29, 2011, two and a half years later than Kingdom Underground.  Style  Duke has said that his musical styling has been influenced by the likes of '90s grunge and rock bands like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden and Nirvana. Other influences include Ani DiFranco and Conor Oberst. He tours primarily as a solo act, with just an acoustic guitar for accompaniment. As a songwriter, Duke's lyrical influences greatly refer to his religious upbringing and literary references, with many songs either directly based on novels, literary characters and/or religion. The track from Kingdom Underground's \\"Rabbit\\" is based on the John Updike Rabbit series of novels, for example. Other songs are based or reference such works as Ayn Rand, Don DeLillo, John Milton and Leon Uris. References to religion can be seen in songs like \\"The Father, The Son and The Harlot's Ghost\\" and the title track to Kingdom Underground, which is a song about the story of Adam & Eve through the perspective of Satan.

The planet was first noted as a transit event by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. The Kepler team made data collected by its satellite publicly available, including data on Kepler-40; French and Swiss astronomers used the equivalent to one night of measurements on the SOPHIE √©chelle spectrograph to collect all the data needed to show that a planet was producing the periodic dimming of Kepler-40. The planet, Kepler-40b, is twice the mass of Jupiter and slightly larger than it in size, making it as dense as Neptune. The planet is also nearly thirteen times hotter than Jupiter and orbits five times closer to its star than Mercury is from the Sun. Observational history Kepler-40 was first observed by the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA satellite that searches for planets in transit (crossing in front of and dimming) their host stars, from May 13, 2009, to June 15, 2009 in its first days of operation. The resulting light curve was made available to the public by the Kepler science team, revealing four transit events over 33.5 days. A team composed of astronomers from France and Switzerland used the SOPHIE √©chelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France to examine Kepler-40. SOPHIE uses radial velocity measurements to examine stars for exoplanets. After background light was removed and alternative causes for radial velocity variations were disproved (for example, that Kepler-40 was actually a close binary star), the team used SOPHIE to analyze the properties of the actual star. The astronomers observing the star found that it is nearing the main sequence turn-off (the star fuses the last of its hydrogen and becomes a red giant). The establishment of stellar parameters helped the astronomers extrapolate the exoplanet's parameters and prove the existence of Kepler-40b. The discovered planet was the sixth transiting planet to have been discovered in orbit around stars with a radius of more than 1.8 times that of the Sun, after planets including Kepler-5 and Kepler-7. The discovery of Kepler-40b demonstrated that smaller telescopes, such as SOPHIE, are effective when used as follow-ups to space missions like Kepler. The team of astronomers spent what amounted roughly to one night on a 1.93d-meter telescope and gathered all the data needed to establish Kepler-40b's existence and parameters. Kepler-40b was published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on January 4, 2011, after it was sent to the journal on September 15, 2010. Host star Kepler-40 is an F-type evolved subgiant star located in the Cygnus constellation. The star is 1.48 times the mass of the Sun and 2.13 times its radius. With an effective temperature of 6510 K, Kepler-40 is larger, more massive, more diffuse, and hotter than the Sun is. The metallicity of Kepler-40, [Fe/H] = 0.10, means that it has 25.9 % more iron than is measured in the Sun. Kepler-40 is nearing the main sequence turn-off; in other words, it is about to fuse the last of its hydrogen and become a red giant. Kepler-40 hosts the sixth planetary system to be discovered in the orbit of a star with a mass of over 1.8 solar masses. It lies approximately 2500 parsecs (8100 light years) away from Earth. Characteristics Kepler-40b is a Hot Jupiter that is estimated to be 2.2 times the mass of Jupiter (over 700 times the mass of Earth), but 1.17 times Jupiter's radius (13.12 times the radius of Earth). Thus, the planet has a density of 1.68 grams per cubic centimeter, similar to that of Neptune (1.638 g/cm3). The planet's equilibrium temperature was initially estimated to be 1620 K, thirteen times hotter than Jupiter's equilibrium temperature. In 2015, the planetary nightside temperature was modeled to be even hotter at 2327 K.A Comprehensive Study of Kepler Phase Curves and Secondary Eclipses:Temperatures and Albedos of Confirmed Kepler Giant Planets Kepler-40b orbits its star every 6.87 days at an average distance of 0.081 AU. It also has an orbital inclination of 89.7¬∞, meaning that it can be seen nearly edge-on with respect to Earth. In comparison, Mercury orbits the Sun every 87.97 days at an average distance of 0.387 AU; therefore, Kepler-40b's orbit is approximately thirteen times faster than that of Mercury's and five times closer to its host star than Mercury is to the Sun.

From 1910 to 1916 this vessel was known as the Mohawk. The vessel is notable as the first steamer on Puget Sound to use oil fuel. Inland Flyer was one of the most famous vessels of the time on Puget Sound.  Design and construction  Inland Flyer was built in 1898 at Portland, Oregon, and was originally intended to run between Portland, Astoria, and The Dalles.Newell, ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History, at 32, 67, 76, 87, 100, 110, 145, 175, 268, and 270. Capt. John Anderson, who later became closely linked with steamboat operations on Lake Washington, discovered Inland Flyer engineless and still under construction at the shipyard of Joseph Supple in Portland, and recommended her purchase to Joshua Green. Anderson bought the hull, and sold it to Green and his associates who were doing business as La Conner Trading and Transportation Company. Anderson then installed the engines and the upper works himself in Portland, and brought the ship himself down the Columbia River and around the Olympic peninsula. Conversion to oil burner On May 21, 1904 plans were announced in the press to convert Inland Flyer and Athlon from coal to oil fuel. The decision was reached after officials of the Puget Sound Navigation Company, including its president, Charles Peabody, had taken a test trip on the Northern Commercial Company's sidewheeler Sadie, which was intended for use in Alaska and had been fitted with oil fuel tanks and burned oil rather than wood or coal. Oil was thought to be both cleaner and as cheap or cheaper than coal. The conversion was planned to be complete in thirty days.Port Townsend Daily Leader, ‚ÄúSound Steamers will Substitute Oil for Coal‚Äù May 21, 1904, page 1, col.4 Inland Flyer thus became the first steam vessel on Puget Sound to use oil fuel, rather than wood or coal, and was the first steamer operating on Puget Sound to use oil fuel.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats ‚Äì A Legend on Puget Sound, at 39, 41. 84, 102, 145-46, 160, 167, and 199. Operations In 1901, La Conner Trading reached a joint operating agreement with H.B. Kennedy to run their steamers in alliance on the profitable Seattle- Bremerton route, which they called the Port Orchard Route. In 1902 Inland Flyer was on the Seattle ‚Äì Port Orchard route, running with the Athlon, which was owned by H.B. Kennedy. There was a brief period of competition on this route in 1902 when the Manette, a boat owned by Tacoma interests, with businessman Fred H. Marvin acting as agent, was placed on the route. Manette was soon transferred to the Seattle ‚Äì Alki run, and the competition ended. In 1903 Inland Flyer came under the control of the Puget Sound Navigation Company when that company merged with La Conner Trading. Capt. Peter Falk (d.1924) one of the major shareholders of Puget Sound Navigation Co. served as one of masters of the Inland Flyer. Another captain was the veteran steamboat man William Mitchell (b. 1879). On May 23, 1903, Inland Flyer was among the steamboats that greeted President Theodore Roosevelt when he toured the Seattle and the Bremerton naval yard.Faber, Steamer's Wake, at 121-122. In 1907 Inland Flyer was placed on the run from Seattle to Bremerton. By 1904, La Conner Trading, by then a subsidiary of PSN, was operating jointly with H.B. Kennedy as the Navy Yard Route on the Seattle ‚Äì Bremerton run. Disposing of three vessels, including Inland Flyer, Athlon, and the sternwheeler Port Orchard, the Navy Yard route ran six sailings a day from Seattle's Pier 2 to and from Bremerton. Rate wars In 1905, the Puget Sound Navigation Company was engaged in a rate war on the Hood Canal route. There were only two steamers at that time that ran on Hood Canal, one was the Perdita, operated by Capt. W.W. McKenzie, and the other was PSN's Garland. PSN arranged to have McKenzie and Perdita bought off with an anti-competitive subsidy agreement, but this did not last, and McKenzie and Perdita were soon back on Hood Canal, driving down rates on Garland from $2.00 to 50 cents ton, with passengers carried from Seattle to any landing on the canal for 25 cents. In addition, PSN was forced to put the Inland Flyer on the Hood Canal route. Considered a speedy vessel, Inland Flyer, together with Garland brought the best steamboat service ever effected on Hood Canal. However, by the end of 1905, PSN resolved the problem of competition from Perdita by purchasing the rival vessel. The first decade of the 1900s was probably the high point of steamboat operations in Puget Sound. The vessels would never been as profitable as they were then. During 1907, when the Puget Sound Navigation Company was involved in a rate war with the Kitsap County Transportation Company, Inland Flyer was shifted to the Seattle ‚Äì Poulsbo route as part of the business maneuvers in the competition. Greene, who was by then a millionaire, and owned more steamboats than any other person on Puget Sound, was criticized in at least one newspaper for his supposed ruthlessness in dealing with Warren L. Gazzam, the chief of the Kitsap County Transportation Co. In 1908, the Port Blakely Mill Company decided to run its steamer Monticello 2 in competition with the Navy Yard Route's steamers, including Inland Flyer. On July 9, 1909, at the wreck of the Yosemite, Inland Flyer stood by with other vessels to assist, helping make sure there was no loss of life when the big excursion sidewheeler went on the rocks near Bremerton.Newell, Ships of the Inland Sea, at 91, 136, 145, and 159. In 1910 the Navy Yard Route sold Inland Flyer to Capt. F.G. Reeve, who was doing business as the Port Washington Route. He renamed the vessel Mohawk. Disposition Wooden steamboats had a useful life of about 20 years, although their components could be reused, sometimes for much longer. In 1916, Mohawk (ex Inland Flyer) was dismantled. The engine was placed in a new vessel, the steamer F.G. Reeve, with the hull going to Neah Bay to serve as a fish-receiving barge.

Background and reception When Doris Smith set out to find a publisher for A Taste of Blackberries what she found instead was rejection. Editors believed her story was better suited to adults than to children. In the end however the main theme is what set it apart from other books for children and earned critical acclaim. If death had at one time been a common theme in books for children, think Oliver Twist, it had long since become taboo. In 1952, E. B. White reintroduced the theme to young readers in his classic Charlotte's Web. For many years Charlotte's Web was the accepted template for addressing mortality in children's books. Then Smith's story appeared, a story in which animals do not stand-in for humans. In the 1970s, literary realism had taken hold, and Smith was at the vanguard of the movement, acquainting young readers with \\"the darker, harsher side of life.\\" According to author and blogger Pauline Dewan; \\"Many writers believe that authors do not help children by sheltering them from the problems of the real world.\\" Indeed, according to the author, many young readers told her \\"they liked it because it was sad.\\" Interviewed for the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Smith recalled that A Taste of Blackberries was supposed to have been an adventure, but when an unexpected plot twist occurred to her Smith locked the manuscript in a drawer and forget about it. Smith resumed work on the novel by focusing on the different ways children and adults respond to mortality. Writing from the point of view of the child gave the story a sensitivity which was highly praised. Rejected by as many as three publishers, A Taste of Blackberries was ultimately accepted by Thomas Y. Crowell Co., now HarperCollins, and released to wide acclaim in May 1973. \\"Smith deals honestly and emphatically with the range of emotions,\\" wrote Cynthia Westway in The Atlanta Journal, \\"the story is not, however, an elegy; but a celebration of the continuity of the life-death cycle.\\" In the Times Literary Supplement, David Rees wrote, \\"It will be difficult to find a children's book this autumn by a new author as good as Doris Buchanan Smith's A Taste of Blackberries . . . Smith's success lies in knowing how to handle the theme with exactly the right balance of sensitivity, humour and open emotion.\\" Plot summary As told from the point of view of the unnamed narrator, the story begins as he and his best friend Jamie go blackberry picking. We follow the boys as they take part in a series of exploits - some told in current narrative time, some revealed in poignant flashbacks - allowing the reader to witness their world and shared experience. When one of the boys tragically dies as a result of an allergic reaction to bee stings, the narrator struggles to cope with denial, grief, guilt, and loneliness, before coming to terms with the loss. The story is set in a suburb of Washington, D.C., the author's birthplace. Characters *Jamie is a \\"show-off and a clown\\". While he can be exasperating, his adventurous and resourceful nature earns the admiration of his best friend. *The narrator, Jamie's appreciative audience and partner in fun, enjoys their friendship, even if, at times, Jamie can go too far. *Heather, with red-gold hair, is the closest friend of both Jamie and the narrator. *Jamie's mother cares for a family of three, including Jamie, four- year-old Martha, and an infant son. *The narrator's mother and father care for the narrator and a college-age daughter who is away at summer camp as a counselor. They also have a son who is grown and married. *Mrs. Houser, Jamie's next door neighbor, is tyrannical when it comes to her perfect lawn. The children in the neighborhood avoid her, and her lawn, if they possibly can. *Mrs. Mullins' \\"secret garden\\" is off limits to most of the children in the neighborhood. The narrator feels privileged to be an exception, mainly because Mrs. Mullins and his mother are friends. Literary significance \\"In dealing directly with the death of a child's playmate, it broke a taboo of twentieth-century American children's fiction,\\" wrote Hugh T. Keenan, in the St. James Guide to Young Adult Writers. British author, lecturer and reviewer David Rees drew parallels between Charlotte's Web and A Taste of Blackberries in The Marble in the Water: Essays on Contemporary Writers of Fiction for Children and Young Adults (1980). He writes that \\"in A Taste of Blackberries we do have a story for young children in which death - sudden and inexplicable - is the main theme, and it is a book in which the characters are not talking animals.\\" \\"The chief purpose of the book,\\" Rees argues, \\"is to write about death in a fashion that young readers can take, and in this Doris Buchanan Smith succeeds admirably.\\" \\"These two authors are saying things that are necessary, and which help children to cope and to grow.\\" A Taste of Blackberries is \\"one of the seminal children's books on the subject of death.\\" Smith won the Josette Frank Award, for \\"outstanding literary merit in which children or young people deal in a positive and realistic way with difficulties in their world and grow emotionally and morally,\\" The author also won the Georgia Children's Book Award, the Children's Best Book Prize in the Netherlands (Zilveren Griffel), and was named Georgia Author of the Year, all for A Taste of Blackberries. In addition to 19 English language editions, the book has been translated into Dutch, Danish, French, Spanish and Japanese. A Taste of Blackberries was nominated for the prestigious Newbery Medal in 1974, and is an ALA Notable Children's Book. \\"It blazed the way for the many other grief books that quickly followed, but few have approached the place of honor this one holds,\\" wrote Jim Trelease in The Read-Aloud Handbook (Penguin Books, 2006).
